* I don't ever want to feel *
* 我再也不想有 *

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,280
* Like I did that day *
* 如那天般的感受 *

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,750
* Take me to the place I love *
* 带我去我爱的地方 *

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,840
* Take me all the way *
* 带我一路走 *

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,490
* I don't ever want to feel *
* 我再也不想有 *

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,680
* Like I did that day *
* 如那天般的感受 *

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,910
* Take me to the place I lo...*
* 带我去我爱的地...*

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,460
Fellas, please.
伙计们 消停点儿吧

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,090
Penny, come on. We were
just finding our sound.
算了吧 Penny 我们刚开始唱呢

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,610
You found it. It's the sound of a
cat being run over by a lawn mower.
你自己听听吧 不知道的还以为
哪只猫被卷进割草机里了呢

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm really very busy.
我真的很忙

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,510
Is there any way that we can put this
off until I have more time to prepare?
我们能否推迟一下?
我好有点时间来准备

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,190
Of course. But, uh, you
understand my trepidation.
当然了 可... 你知道我有些啥顾虑

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.
- 他又在干嘛?
- 毫无头绪

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,620
Can't we just postpone
it till the spring?
就不能推迟到开春吗?

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,030
Maybe next summer?
或者明年夏天?

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,100
This should be fairly easy to deduce.
这个应该很好推断的

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,290
He's holding the phone to his left ear.
他把电话搁在左耳旁边

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,880
Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the
analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain,
左耳还是左脑控制的
所以他是在理性分析而不是感情用事

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,380
suggesting that he has no personal
relationship with the caller.
表明他和来电者没有私人关系

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,570
No, I didn't realize
it had been so long.
不 我没想到已经这么久了

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,210
Sure, I guess there's no other
choice but to just go ahead and do it.
好吧 那就只好这么办了

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,290
He's referring to an
activity he has done before.
他谈到了一件以前做过的事

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,780
It's unpleasant and
needs to be repeated.
那件事不怎么令人愉快
但又不得不再来一遍

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,310
This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
表明这件事应该是某种侵入性
医疗检查 比如说 结肠镜检查

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,080
Aren't there any other options?
就没有其他选择了么?

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,320
There's not a lot of room.
It's gonna be uncomfortable.
没多大地方 肯定很不舒服的

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,910
Yes, yes.
没错 没错

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,410
I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.
我敢肯定是结肠镜检查

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,010
Okay, bye.
好吧 再见

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,700
My mother's coming to visit.
我妈要来看我

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,200
How about that, you were right.
听听 你说得没错啊

36
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,230
It's out of order.
电梯坏了

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,270
Yes, I can read the sign. I'm
just pondering the implications.
嗯 我识字的 我只是在沉思
其背后的深意

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,080
I think it implies that
the elevator doesn't work.
我觉得这意味着电梯不工作了

39
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,090
Again, I can read the sign.
再说一遍 我识字的

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,470
But the sign and the tape are
coated with a layer of dust,
不过标签和胶带上都有厚厚一层灰了

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,740
which indicates that the elevator has been
nonfunctional for a significant amount of time.
这表示电梯已经坏了
有相当长的一段时间了

42
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,240
Which suggests either a
remarkable passivity among the,
也就暗示着这栋大楼里的

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,220
I assume, 24 to 36
residents of this building,
大约24到36位居民十分不主动

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,530
based on the number of mailboxes and
given typical urban population density
噢 居民数我是从邮箱的数目以及
普通城镇人口密度推断出来的

45
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,290
or a shared delusion of functionality.
或者说这些人都有功能性错觉

46
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,050
You must be Leonard's mother.
你一定是Leonard他母亲

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,830
Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.
噢 不知道是不是非得是 不过是的

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,580
Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbor.
我是Penny 他的邻居

49
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,470

I'll walk you to the apartment.

exchange pleasantries on the way?
噢 好啊 路上咱先寒暄寒暄吧?

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,770
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.
- 嗯 好啊

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,300
Okay. You know, I've
always been curious.
行 你要知道 我一直都好奇心很重

56
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,990
What was Leonard like
when he was little?
Leonard小时候是什么样的?

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,370
Oh, I think you mean young.
He's always been little.
噢 我想你是指他年轻的时候
他一直都是个小不点儿

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,960
Right, okay. What was he
like when he was young?
没错 他年轻的时候是什么样的?

59
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,100
You'll have to be more specific.
你得再说具体点儿

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,900
Um, okay, like, five or six.
呃... 好吧 比如说 五六岁的时候

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,620
Five.
五岁

62
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,800
Oh, well, at that age, he was well enmeshed in what Freud
would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development.
那时他正深陷于弗洛伊德所谓的
心理性发展之生殖器崇拜阶段

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,990
An outmoded theory, of course, but the
boy did spend most of his waking hours
当然是个过时的理论了
不过那孩子确实在大部分醒着的时候

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,620
with a tight grasp on his penis.
牢牢地抓住自己的小弟弟不放

65
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,930
Yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.
是啊 Leonard说起过 你是个精神病学家

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Well, that is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.
那只是其中一个学位罢了
我主要涉及的领域是神经系统学

67
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,630
Well, I'm an actress.
我是个演员

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,250
Why?
为什么?

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,390
What do you mean why?
什么叫为什么?

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,350
Well, there are studies
that suggest that many
有研究表明

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,360
who go into the performing arts suffer
from an external locus of identity.
许多演艺界的人士都有外控性格

72
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
我不知道你在说什么

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,280
Well, it means you value
yourself only as others value you,
是说当别人重视你时 你才会重视自己

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,340
which is often the result of
unmet childhood emotional needs.
通常是童年未满足的情感需求导致的

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,360
Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
噢 我的童年可了不得了

76
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,890

是么

I know my dad wanted a boy.
我知道老爸想要个儿子

78
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,850
I-I just, I tried being good at
sports, but I hated getting dirty!
我... 我努力让自己变成体育健将
可我真的讨厌把自己弄脏!

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,450
And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.
然后 我想你进入了青春期

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
He called me Slugger until
I got my first training bra.
在我得到第一件运动内衣之前
他都管我叫"重击手"来着

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,340
And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.
之后他就不和我玩传接球了

82
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,010
I wasn't Slugger anymore.
我再也不是"重击手"了

83
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,500
Your mother's here!
你妈妈来了!

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,860
If y w want to have intercouee with tt t girl,

如果你想和那个姑娘上床
查查他老爸擦的是哪种古龙水

I'll start again.

I*******
我也有同样的困扰

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,670
*******developed sex drive.
我的看法是他无法集中精力
是因为过度发达的性冲动造成的

98
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,350
Oh, I don't know where
he would've gotten that.
他怎么会有那玩意儿

99
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,090
Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,
除却一段形式上完满的婚姻

100
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,170
his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.
他的父亲和我交髯只是为了繁殖

101
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,410
That seems a fairly
efficient arrangement.
这样还真是高效哈

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes, we think so. We've
both done papers on it.
是啊 我们也这么想

view and his from an anthropological.

read about your sex life.

you the PowerPoint presentation.

You'll have to be more specific.

All right. Uh, what's new with you?

Oh, well, I've been having some
fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
哦 我最近有一些令人着迷的
更年期征兆

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,400
Maybe something less personal.
说些不是太私人的事

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,930
Your Uncle Floyd died.
你Floyd叔叔死了

Yeah, I-I thought you
guys might hit it off.
是啊 我就觉着你俩合得来

125
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,290
I envy you your childhood.
我很嫉妒你的童年

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,420
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories
I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
不想这么说 但我童年时期唯一
温暖的记忆都是来自我Floyd叔叔

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,980
You're clearly misremembering.
你很显然记错了

128
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,070
Your mother is brilliant,
analytical, insightful.
你妈妈太有才了 既有分析能力
又富有洞察力

129
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,190
And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible
because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
而且我打赌她不会因为
你不吃芽甘蓝 就用圣经来打你

130
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,720
Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.
Sheldon 你太不会欣赏你妈妈了

131
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,610
She's warm, she's loving,
她很温暖 她很慈爱

132
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,450
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to
measure your brain waves while potty training.
不会在你学用婴儿便盆时
就把电极粘到你头上来测脑电波

133
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,730
You were lucky.When I was
a kid, if I wanted an EEG,
够有福了 我小的时候
要是想做脑电图

134
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,730
I had to attach my own electrodes.
我还得自己接电极

135
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,160
So, Dr.Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about
his incredibly successful brother and sister.
Hofstadter博士 Lenoard很少谈起
