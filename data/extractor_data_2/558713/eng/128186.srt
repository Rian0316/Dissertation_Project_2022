1
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:02,918
GRANDMA'S HERE.

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:06,042
IN LIFE...IT'S A POST-NUPTIAL AGREEMENT.

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,292
I'M NOT SIGNING THIS.

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:09,083
AAH!SIGN IT!

5
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,459
STOP! YOU'RE HURTING ME!

6
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:13,792
MRS. SOLIS,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

7
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,083
YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE.

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,375
PEOPLE LEAVE TRAILS.

9
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,292
ONE OF THOSE TRAILS WILL LEAD TO DEIRDRE.

10
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,918
I'M NOT TAKING MY MONEY TO THE GRAVE.

11
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,834
I'M GOING TO USE IT TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

12
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,918
OR WHO PEOPLE REALLY ARE.

13
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:27,959
ANDREW JUST TOLD ME HE THINKS HE MIGHT BE GAY.

14
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:35,501
 EVERY MORNING

15
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,209
AS SHE WENT TO TAKE OUT HER TRASH,

16
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,417
LYNETTE SCAVO WOULD INDULGE IN A LITTLE DAYDREAM,

17
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,709
THE DETAILS OF WHICH WERE ALWAYS THE SAME.

18
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,042
ONE DAY HER NASTY NEIGHBOR KAREN McCLUSKEY

19
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:52,167
WOULD KEEL OVER AND DIE,

20
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,083
AND HER HOME WOULD BE BOUGHT BY A LOVELY SWEDISH FAMILY

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:00,834
WITH TWO ADORABLE TWIN DAUGHTERS.

22
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:04,125
THE FAMILIES WOULD FORM AN EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP,

23
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:08,751
CULMINATING IN THEIR DAUGHTERS MARRYING HER SONS

24
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:10,542
AT AN ELABORATE WEDDING

25
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,959
THE SCAVOS WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR.

26
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,417
YES, LYNETTE ENJOYED HER LITTLE DAYDREAM,

27
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:24,000
BUT MRS. McCLUSKEY ALWAYS HAD A WAY

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,292
OF PULLING HER BACK TO REALITY.

29
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:29,292
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

30
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:32,417
WHY ARE YOU STEALING MY GARBAGE CANS?

31
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,167
GARBAGE PICKUP WAS TWO DAYS AGO,

32
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,918
AND THESE CANS HAVE BEEN ON THE STREET EVER SINCE.

33
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:37,459
I JUST ASSUMED YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM ANYMORE.

34
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,834
OH, THAT'S VERY CUTE.

35
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,459
THAT'S GOOD. HERE. GIVE THEM HE.

36
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,417
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WE GOT TO LOOK AT THAT GOD-AWFUL COLOR

37
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,083
YOU PAINTED THE HOUSE.WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STARE

38
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,125
 AT YOUR CANS FOR DAYS ON END.

39
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,792
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GOOD NEIGHBOR ETIQUETTE?

40
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,167
HOW ABOUT YOU HIRE A GARDENER

41
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,334
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT JUNGLE YOU CALL A LAWN?

42
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,125
I AM ON A FIXED INCOME.

43
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,209
OH. WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

44
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,709
MOVING SOMEWHERE LESS EXPENSIVE,

45
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,000
LIKE A NURSING HOME.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,250
GO TO HELL. RUN BY GERMANS, HMM?

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,083
AND YOU KNOW -

48
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,626
OH. OH.

49
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,667
MRS. -- MRS. McCLUSKEY.

50
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,626
MRS. McCLUSKEY,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

51
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,417
I'LL GET THE DOOR.

52
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,584
MRS. McCLUSKEY.

53
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:24,626
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT,LYNETTE WAS PRESENTED

54
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,959
WITH AN INTERESTING CHOICE OF OPTIONS.

55
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,459
AND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE'D HATE HERSELF IN THE MORNING,

56
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,626
LYNETTE CHOSE TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

57
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,501
LYNETTE, WHERE ARE THEY TAKING ME?

58
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,542
YOU'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL,MRS. McCLUSKEY.

59
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,626
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

60
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,626
I DON'T WANT TO GO ALONE.COME WITH ME.

61
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:45,709
OH, UM, THESE ARE TRAINED TECHNICIANS,

62
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,167
AND I'VE GOT A ROAST IN THE...FREEZER.

63
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,876
PLEASE. I'M SCARED.

64
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,792
YEAH, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

65
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,792
OKAY, HERE I AM.THANK YOU.

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
IF I DIE, I DON'T WANT IT TO BE WITH STRANGERS.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,626
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE.

68
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:07,375
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

69
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:12,292
OF COURSE,LYNETTE DIDN'T RESPOND.

70
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,209
HOW COULD SHE TELL HER NEIGHBOR THAT SOME DREAMS

71
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,709
WERE JUST TOO BEAUTIFUL TO COME TRUE?

72
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,542
Mary Alice: LIFE IS A JOURNEY,

73
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:14,125
ONE THAT IS MUCHETTER TRAVELED WITH A COMPANION BY OUR SIDE.

74
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,792
BUT SOMETIMES WE LOSE OUR COMPANIONS ALONG THE WAY,

75
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,542
AND THEN THE JOURNEY BECOMES UNBEARABLE.

76
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,083
Mike: NOAH.

77
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,000
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A RELIGIOUS MAN.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,250
WHAT'S WITH THE ROSARY?

79
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,626
THEY FOUND DIERDRE.

80
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:34,959
WHAT?

81
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,792
HER BODY HAD BEEN STUFFED INSIDE A TOY CHEST.

82
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,709
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

83
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,250
A KID'S TOY CHEST.

84
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,501
SHE'D BEEN DISMEMBERED.

85
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,792
OH, MY GOD.

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,834
COPS I.D.'d HER FROM HER DENTAL RECORDS.

87
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,334
SHE'S BEEN DEAD 15 YEARS.

88
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,959
ALL THAT TIME I WAS LOOKING FOR HER,

89
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,834
SHE WAS ALREADY GONE.

90
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,626
I'M SO SORRY.

91
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:27,626
I HAVE TO BURY MY BABY.

92
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,000
I CAME OUT HERE TO, UH...

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,167
FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF TOMBSTONE TO GET HER.

94
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,959
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS NOW.

95
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,584
LET'S GET YOU HOME.

96
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,709
THERE'S A COP I WANT YOU TO TALK TO.

97
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,083
A COP?

98
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:49,751
TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF YOU FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR'S MURDER.

99
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,667
HE'LL GET YOU THE FILE ON DIERDRE'S CASE.

100
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,250
APPARENTLY,THEY HAVE SOME LEADS.

101
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,334
Rex: I DON'T KNOW.

102
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,584
I THINK WE MAY BE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

103
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,709
Bree: WE MADE OUR DECISION.LET'S JUST STICK TO IT.

104
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,042
LET'S SAY WE LEAVE HIM HERE THREE MORE WEEKS.

105
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,959
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?

106
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,959
OUR SON JUST TOLD US THAT HE MIGHT BE GAY.

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,250
THERE ARE 200 HER BOYS IN THIS CAMP.

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,709
NOW, I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF

109
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,459
WE LEFT HIM HERE,BUT I'M A LADY,

110
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,292
AND I DON'T USE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

111
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,167
YOU KNOW, I BET WE'RE WORRYING OURSELVES SICK OVER NOTHING.

112
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,626
THIS IS PROBABLY JUST A PHASE.

113
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,209
EXACTLY,SO WE'LL GET HIM HOME,

114
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,876
WE'LL GET HIM INTO CHRISTIAN COUNSELING

115
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,083
SO IT WON'T BECOME A LIFESTYLE.

116
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,584
WELL, WHATEVER'S GOING ON WITH HIM,

117
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,292
HE'S STILL OUR SON,AND WE LOVE HIM.

118
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,709
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME?

119
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,167
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS HOW FREAKED OUT YOU ARE

120
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,000
BY THE WHOLE GAY THING.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,501
I MAY BE FREAKED OUT,

122
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,167
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM.

123
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,334
I'M JUST SAYING BE COOL.

124
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,792
I CAN BE JUST AS COOL AS YOU CAN.

125
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:04,792
ALL RIGHT.

126
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,083
IT'LL BE NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

127
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:23,709
ANDREW...I WOULD LOVE YOU EVEN IF YOU WERE A MURDERER.

128
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,167
MOMMY,THE LINE'S NOT MOVING.

129
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,542
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE.

130
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,083
MOM. MOM.

131
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,042
WHAT? KIDS ARE WAITING.

132
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:52,250
OH, HONEY, HECTOR HERE TEACHES SALSA DANCING

133
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,709
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

134
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,375
I GIVE PRIVATE LESSONS, TOO.

135
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,542
OH, I BET YOU DO.

136
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,000
MOM.WHAT?

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,209
COULD YOU PLEASE NOT FLIRT WITH THE ICE CREAM MAN?

138
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:01,918
WHY NOT?

139
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,834
DO YOU NEED A REASON BEYOND THE FACT

140
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,334
THAT HE'S THE ICE CREAM MAN?

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,959
[ Sighs ] IT'S CALLED MOVING ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

142
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,792
YOU JUST BROKE UP WITH MORTY TWO WEEKS AGO.

143
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,542
DON'T YOU THINK YOU CAN AT LEAST PRETEND

144
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,083
TO MOURN THE RELATIONSHIP?

145
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,209
OH, YOU ARE SUCH A STICK IN THE MUD.

146
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,542
WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE HAVING FUN.

147
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,751
I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO TONIGHT.

148
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,959
WE CAN GO TO SOME HIP CLUB AND GET SOME HOT GUYS.

149
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,626
MOM --OH, IT'LL BE GREAT.

150
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,667
I'LL SAY I'M 42, AND YOU CAN BE 28.

151
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,375
WHAT?

152
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,292
OH, YOU CAN PULL IT OFF.

153
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,959
MRS. McCLUSKEY, YOU'RE BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL ALREADY?

154
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,876
TURNS OUT I O.D.'d A LITTLE BIT ON MY ARRITIS MEDICATION.

00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:53,459
YOU'LL FIND OUT ABOUT THAT SOON ENOUGH.

158
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,501
HA HA.

159
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,459
WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

160
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,334
HERE.

161
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,167
MY WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU

162
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,083
FOR NOT LETTING ME DIE OUT THERE ON THE LAWN.

163
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,584
OH, MRS. McCLUSKEY,YOU DON'T --

164
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,959
KEEP THAT.IT'S GENUINE TIFFANY.

165
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,459
IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR YEARS.

166
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

167
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,209
IT'S -- IT'S STUNNING. THANK YOU.

168
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,959
I'D INVITE YOU IN, BUT --

169
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,709
WELL, I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT MY DOCTOR SAID.

170
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,751
SEEMS THAT ARTHRITIS IS THE LEAST OF MY PROBLEMS.

171
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,459
SEE, I HAD THIS SKIN TAG --

172
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,918
OR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SKIN TAG,

173
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:37,000
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT MIGHT BE MORE SERIOUS.

174
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,167
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

175
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,959
PLEASE -- I CAN'T SLEEP IN THE DEN ANYMORE.

176
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,000
I NEED TO SLEEP IN A BED.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,876
WELL, THEN, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY A MOTEL,

178
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,501
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK IN HERE.

179
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,876
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I GOT TO SAY I'M SORRY?

180
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,626
OBVIOUSLY, A FEW MORE.

181
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,834
I AM NOT PROUD OF WHAT I DID.

182
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,167
I ADMIT,I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

183
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,709
YOU WANT BACK IN THIS BED?

184
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,709
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

185
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,334
I'M NOT TEARING UP THE POST-NUP.

186
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,334
WHY NOT?

187
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:14,000
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE WAY THAT I CAN ENSURE

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,459
YOU'LL BE HERE WHEN I GET OUT OF JAIL.

189
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,959
WELL, THEN HAVE FUN AT THE MOTEL.

190
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,334
FINE.

191
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:23,000
TOMORROW I'M CANCELING YOUR CREDIT CARDS.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,292
WHAT?

193
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,125
AND I'M TAKING AWAY YOUR ATM AS WELL.

194
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,667
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR MONEY?

195
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,751
MAYBE ONCE YOU SEE HOW GOOD YOU'VE GOT IT HERE,

196
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,417
YOU'LL START TREATING ME WITH A LITTLE RESPECT.

197
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:35,417
YOU WANT MY RESPECT?THEN TEAR UP THE POST-NUP.

198
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,042
GIVE ME MY PILLOW.

199
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,292
ONE MORE THING --

200
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,626
IF YOU EVER HURT ME AGAIN, I WILL KILL YOU.

201
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,417
IF YOU EVER LEAVE ME FOR ANOTHER MAN,

202
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:46,584
I'LL KILL YOU.

203
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,501
BOY, WITH ALL THIS PASSION,

204
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,292
ISN'T IT A SHAME THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX?

205
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,959
I FEEL TRAPPED.

206
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,083
YOU WANT ME TO OPEN A WINDOW?

207
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,167
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE.

208
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,375
OH.ARE WE DONE MAKING OUT?

209
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,709
NO, NO.KEEP GOING.

210
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,751
SO WHAT'S UP?

211
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,709
I'M UNHAPPY

212
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,876
WITH CARLOS AND MY MARRIAGE.

213
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,876
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE OPTIONS,

214
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,250
AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

215
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,375
EVERY TIME SOMETHING WENT SOUTH IN MY LIFE,

216
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,292
I ALWAYS HAD A PLAN "B."

217
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,250
NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NOTHING.

218
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,792
WHAT ABOUT ME?CAN'T I BE YOUR PLAN "B"?

219
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,918
DAMN IT, JOHN,WHAT IS OUR NEW RULE?

220
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,083
STOP PRETENDING WE HAVE A FUTURE.

221
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,918
THANK YOU.

222
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,125
CAN'T YOU JUST WALK OUT?

223
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,501
NO, 'CAUSE IF I LEAVE,THEN I'LL BE BROKE,

224
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,834
AND THAT'S AWFUL.IF I STAY,

225
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,459
THEN HE'S IN CONTROL,AND THAT'S HORRIFYING.

226
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,000
AND HE CUT UP ALL MY CREDIT CARDS,

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,792
WHICH MEANS I'M MARRIED TO HIM AND UNABLE TO SHOP,

228
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,876
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS.

229
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,584
I'M SORRY.

230
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,250
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

231
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,042
I'M NOT MUCH FUN TODAY.

232
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,459
I'M GOING TO GO.

233
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:12,542
WAIT

234
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,959
WHAT'S THIS?

235
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,584
YOU DESERVE NICE THINGS,

236
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,250
AND IF MR. SOLIS WON'T PROVIDE THEM, I WILL.

237
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:25,167
WITH YOUR STUDENT CREDIT CARD?

238
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,375
I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS.

239
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,501
YOU MOW LAWNS. I MAKE GOOD MONEY.

240
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,542
YOU KNOW, I HAVE 20 HOUSES, AND I'M THIS CLOSE

241
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,959
TO GETTING THE DRIVING RANGE AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

242
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,667
I CAN'T.

243
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,959
YES, YOU CAN.

244
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,375
I'LL PAY IT OFF.

245
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,292
IF YOU WANT.BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

246
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:49,792
MRS. SOLIS...TO TAKE CARE OF YOU --

247
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,918
IT'S MY DREAM.

248
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,459
WELL, FAR BE IT FROM ME

249
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,042
TO STAND IN THE WAY OF A YOUNG MAN'S DREAM.

250
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,751
OKAY, TOM, YEAH.

251
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,292
I WILL SWING BY THE DRY CLEANERS

252
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,584
AFTER I HIT THE MARKET.

253
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,459
MM, I DON'T KNOW.

254
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,000

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,834

256
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:14,250

I HAVE A TREE IN BACK,BUT I HATE THEM,

259
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:19,876
AND YOUR FAMILY SEEMS LIKE THE KIND

260
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,083
THAT WOULD EAT GUACA-MALE.

261
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,167
UM, MRS. McCLUSKEY, THANK YOU.THAT IS VERY NICE.

262
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,209

265
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,209

266
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,501
AND I COULDHITCH A RIDE.

267
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,709
I NEED TO DROP BY THE PHARMACY ANYWAY.

268
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,792
NO, I CAN'T.I'M SORRY,

269
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,667
BUT I-I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.

270
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,959
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE ME LATER.I COULD DROP BY TOMORROW.

271
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,751
MRS. McCLUSKEY, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY TIME TOMORROW.

272
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:49,542

00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,042
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS BACK.

276
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,250
I-I DON'T HAVE A PLACE FOR IT.

277
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,459
BUT THAT WAS MY THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

278
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,542
I KNOW, AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE.

279
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,125

280
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,125

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,834
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE ANYBODY UP

286
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,542
AT A QUARTER TO 1:00.

287
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,292
OH, SUSIE, YOU SHOULD HAVE COME OUT TONIGHT.

288
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,959
I MET TIM HERE AT THE ISLANDS BAR,

289
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,083
AND HE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS CRAZY DRINK --

290
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,000
HA HA --THE DIRTY VOLCANO.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,542
WHOO.

292
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,417
AND THEN WE DANCED,

293
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,876
AND HE DIPPED ME.

294
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,792
SOPHIE'S VERY LIMBER.

295
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,459
UH, MOM,COULD I JUST TALK TO YOU

296
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,083

297
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:07,918
OH, SURE.

298
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:10,083
SUSAN IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

299
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,083
HA HA. YEAH.

00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,584
NO, SHE CAN'T BE.YES.

00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,709
NO.YEAH.NO.YEAH.

302
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,542
NO.YES.

303
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,959
OKAY, WE GET IT.SHE LOOKS YOUNG.

304
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,000
OH.

305
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,167
THAT MAN HAS MAGIC FINGERS.

306
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,542
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I HAVE A TEENAGE DAUGHTER IN THE HOUSE.

307
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,083
YOU CAN'T JUST BRING STRANGE MEN

308
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,042
YOU MEET IN BARS HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

309
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,626
WE'RE JUST HAVING A FEW LAUGHS.

310
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,250
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

311
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,667
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OVER MORTY,

312
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,083
BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT,

313
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,584
SO CAN YOU PLEASE JUST GO OUT THERE

314
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,584
AND TELL HIM TO GO HOME?

315
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,667
YOU KNOW HOW BLUE I'VE BEEN.

316
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,959
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SUPPORTIVE?

317
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,167
I HAVE BEEN PLENTY SUPPORTIVE.

318
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,334
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.YOU REALLY HAVEN'T.

319
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:52,459
NOW, TIM IS MY GUEST,

320
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,501
AND HE WILL GO HOME WHEN I SAY SO.

321
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,834
IF HE'S NOT GONE IN FIVE MINUTES,

322
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,250
I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM

323
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,834
EXACTLY HOW OLD YOU REALLY ARE.

324
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,083
TIM, IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO SLEEPY-BYE.

325
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,834
HA HA.

326
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,375

IS THERE A PROBLEM?

333
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,334
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

334
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,542
I'M HANDING A CONFIDENTIAL POLICREPORT

335
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,876
OVER TO A KILLER AND DRUG DEALER.

336
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,959
WHY SHOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM?

337
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,709

338
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,000

BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY --

348
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:30,626
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BUY OFF A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE THESE DAYS?

349
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:36,751

353
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:12,000
THERE WILL BE ONE LESS COP KILLER ON THE STREET.

354
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,542
AND FOR GOD'S SAKES...

355
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,876
DON'T GET ANY BLOOD ON THE FILE.

356
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,709
MA'AM, I'M SORRY,

357
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,834
BUT YOUR CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN DECLINED.

358
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,792
WHAT?

359
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,542
OH, NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.IT'S A NEW CARD.

360
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,250
I JUST WENT SHOPPING WITH IT.

361
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,584
TRY IT AGAIN.

362
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,542
MA'AM, I RAN IT THREE TIMES, AND THEN I CALLED THE BANK.

363
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,584
NOW, MAY I TRY ANOTHER CARD?

364
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,417
OF COURSE YOU MAY.

365
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,000
WILL YOU JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT?

366
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,000
HELLO?IT'S ME.

367
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,375
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU,BUT YOU TURNED YOUR CELL OFF.

368
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,834
BECAUSE I'M IN A LOVELY RESTAURANT

369
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:21,000
HAVING A LOVELY MEAL THAT I NOW CAN'T PAY FOR.

370
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,709
WELL, DID YOU ORDER ALREADY?

371
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,792
I ATE ALREADY.

372
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,250
LOOK, THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY CALLED MY MOM.

373
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,876
I MEAN, THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS UNUSUAL ACTIVITY ON MY CARD.

374
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,083
I BOUGHT SHOES.WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

375
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,292
AND THEN MY MOM STARTED ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS,

376
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,417
SO I JUST BLURTED OUT THAT THE CARD WAS STOLEN,

377
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,375
AND SHE CANCELED IT.

378
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,292
WHY WOULD THEY CALL YOUR PARENTS? IT'S YOUR ACCOUNT.

379
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,209
THEY CO-SIGNED FOR IT.

380
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,667
LOOK, IF YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO THE WAITER --

381
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,918
WHAT, THAT THE CREDIT CARD WAS CANCELED

382
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,125
BY MY LOVER'S MOMMY?

383
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,626
WELL, WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE?

384
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,000
UNLESS YOU RETURN THE SHOES AND GET THE MONEY BACK.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,751
RETURN THE SHOES?

386
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,626
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE BEING HYSTERICAL.

387
00:19:58,751 --> 00:19:59,709
SO, MA'AM,

388
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,292
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO ABOUT THE BILL?

389
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:17,292
AFTERNOON. I'VE GOT A PACKAGE FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR

390
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,125
KAREN McCLUSKEY. YOU MIND SIGNING?

391
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,375
WELL, ISN'T SHE HOME?SHE USUALLY NEVER GOES ANYWHERE.

392
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,250
NO ONE ANSWERED.

393
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:29,125
ALL RIGHT.OKAY.

394
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:30,959
THANK YOU.

395
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,417
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT --

396
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,417
YOU PLAY TENNIS,YOU KNOW WINE,

397
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,876
AND YOU SPEAK MANDARIN.

398
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:50,792
DOES EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD WANT YOU DEAD?

399
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,876
HA HA HA HA.

400
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,584
WELL, I'M NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE.

401
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,209
I PULLED A GRAY HAIR OUT OF MY CHEST THIS MORNING.

402
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:59,167
HA HA. I DON'T KNOW.I'D WATCH YOUR BACK.

403
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,667
YOU KNOW, I'VE REALLY ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU.

404
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,459
YOU, UH...

405
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,626
WELL, YOU MADE MY DAY.

406
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,792
I WATHINKING IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET TOGETHER AGAIN...

407
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:16,125
WELL, SAM, TO --TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

408
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,000
I'M KIND OF IN A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
I JUST WANTED TO BE HONEST.

410
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,042
THAT'S PERFECTLY OKAY, TINA.

411
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:27,626
BY THE WAY...THIS IS ON ME.

412
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,250
OH, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T.

413
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,167
OH, PLEASE.

414
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,459
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

415
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:40,792
THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER.

416
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,000
IT'LL BE FINE.

417
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:47,250
ANDREW, HONEY, HURRY UP.DINNER'S READY.

418
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,250
IT'S LIKE WE'RE SETTING A TRAP FOR HIM.

419
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,125
IT'S FOR HIS OWN GOOD.YOU'LL SEE.

420
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,292
SMELLS GOOD.

421
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,459
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

422
00:21:56,459 --> 00:22:00,209
I'M MAKING HOMEMADE BRATWURST WITH SWEET-AND-SOUR CABBAGE.

423
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:03,167
IT'S A RECIPE I FOUND IN AN OLD GERMAN COOKBOOK.

424
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,542
I'LL GET THE DOOR.

425
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,042
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU POUR THE WINE?

426
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,876
ISN'T DANIELLE SPENDING THE NIGHT AT WENDY'S

427
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,876
I BELIEVE SHE IS.

428
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,542
WELL, THEN WHY DID MOM SET THE TABLE FOR FOUR PLACES?

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,167
UH, I ASKED WHO'S COMING FOR DINNER.

430
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,292
ANDREW...YOU REMEMBER REVEREND SIKES, DON'T YOU?

431
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,792
OH, COME ON.

432
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,626
UM, REVEREND,WHY DON'T YOU HAVE SEAT,

433
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,459
AND I WILL GET SOME REFRESHMENTS?

434
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:42,876
SO, ANDREW...IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

435
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:46,125
YES.YES, IT HAS.

436
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,250
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WATER? I HAVE FLAT OR BUBBLY.

437
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,417
OH, BUBBLY, PLEASE.

438
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,292
SO...

439
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,918
YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME YOU'VE STARTED HAVING

440
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:57,250
SOME SEXUAL DESIRES FOR OTHER BOYS.

441
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,459
I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD GET SOME OF THAT.

442
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:07,375
NOPE.I'M GOING TO NEED EVERY DROP.

443
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,459
AND OVER THE YEARS,

444
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:14,125
WE'VE HAD SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE COME TO OUR MINISTRY

445
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,959
HATING THEMSELVES FOR THEIR UNNATURAL DESIRES,

446
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,709
AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS,THEY'VE FOUND AN INNER PEACE

447
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:22,959
AND A TRANQUILITY THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF MIRACULOUS.

448
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,000
OH.

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,959
AND ALL IT TAKES IS A LITTLE FAITH

450
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,000
AND A DESIRE TO CHANGE.

451
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:30,834
I'M SORRY,BUT I-I REALLY DON'T

452
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,292
 WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY SEX LIFE.

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,834
WELL, THAT'S JUST TOO BAD,

454
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,250
BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED.

455
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,459
BREE, PLEASE, LET THE BOY SPEAK.GO ON.

456
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,083
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER TO HELP.

457
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,792
I DO.BUT I DON'T HATE MYSELF.

458
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,375
SO I'M GOOD.

459
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,083
SON, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A TEENAGER.

460
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,209
IT'S A VERY CONFUSING TIME.

461
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:55,417
I'M NOT CONFUSED.

462
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:59,000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO I AM.

463
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:07,626
WELL...IF YOU EVER DO WANT TO TALK,

464
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:09,834
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

465
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:18,125
REVEREND, I DON'T MEAN TO CRITICIZE, BUT...

466
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,584
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GIVING UP.

467
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,501
WE CAN'T FORCE HIM ON THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

468
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,792
HE HIMSELF HAS GOT TO WANT TO MAKE THE JOURNEY.

469
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,959
WELL, THEN,WHAT DO WE DO,

470
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,792
JUST STAND BY WHILE HE STARTS DATING BOYS?

471
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,626
AND BY THE WAY,THE CORRECT WORD IS NOT "GAY."

472
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:35,751
IT'S "SODOMY."

473
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,083
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF DINNER. SO?

474
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,834
SO CAN YOU AT LEAST WAITILL DESSERT

475
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,667
BEFORE CALLING OUR SON A SODOMITE?

476
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,167
HOW YOU CAN SIT THERE AND BE SO CASUAL IS BEYOND ME.

477
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,667
FOR STARTERS, I KNEW THIS DINNER WAS A BAD IDEA

478
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:46,709
THE MOMENT YOU SUGGESTED IT.

479
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,959
WELL, AT LEAST I'M TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE.

480
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,459
PLEASE, THERE'S NO NEED TO GET UPSET.

481
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,334
I AM UPSET BECAUSE THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE,

482
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,792
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE IT BUT ME.

483
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,459
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,IF ANDREW IS HAPPY

484
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,000
WITH WHO HE IS, THEN IT IS OUR JOB TO SUPPORT HIM.

485
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,000
YOUR FATHER IS INTO S&M.

486
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,167
BREE.

487
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,709
HE MAKES ME BEAT HIM WITH A RIDING CROP,AND I LET HIM.

488
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:17,000
IT'S NO WONDER YOU'RE PERVERTED. LOOK WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE.

489
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:24,709
EXCUSE ME.

490
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,083
WHAT A FUN NIGHT.

491
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,334
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD REALLY DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

492
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,876
HEY.HEY -- GOOD NEWS.

493
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,834
I KNOW WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO FURIOUS AT ME.

494
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,501
I HAVEN'T BEEN FURIOUS AT YOU.

495
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:53,375
OH, WELL, YES, YOU HAVE,

496
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,584
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.

497
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:57,959
MEN HAVE BEEN COMING ON TO ME LEFT AND RIGHT,

498
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,918
AND I JUST -- I'VE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH FUN

499
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:02,292
AND JUST ENJOYING LIFE,AND --

500
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,626
WHAT DO I DO?I THROW IT RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.

501
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:06,417
I'D HATE ME, TOO.

502
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,834
MOM, I DON'T HATE YOU.

503
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,792
WELL, BE THAT AS IT MAY,

504
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,042
FROM HERE ON OUT,

505
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,918
I'M INCLUDING YOU IN ALL THE FUN.

506
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:15,334
THE FUN?MM-HMM.

507
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,876
YOUR MOTHER'S COME THROUGH.

508
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,834
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

509
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:22,125
YOU AND I ARE GOING ON A DOUBLE DATE TONIGHT.

510
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:22,792
WHAT?

511
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,626
TIM HAS A FRIEND FROM THE BOX FACTORY,

512
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,667
AND I THOUGHT THE FOUR OF US COULD HANG OUT,

513
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,542
HAVE A FEW DRINKS,SOME HORS D'OEUVRES, AND --

514
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,292
FORGET IT.

515
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,250
WELL, SUSIE --

516
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,626
MOM, I'M SORRY.

517
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,667
I'M JUST NOT IN THE MOOD TO HANG OUT THESE DAYS.

518
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,709
SUSIE, SWEETIE, PLEASE, I CAN'T CANCEL NOW.

519
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:37,959
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

520
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,459
JUST CALL THEM UP AND TELL THEM NOT TO COME OVER.

521
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,083
TIM.HI, SUSE.

522
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,209
THIS IS -THIS IS MY BUDDY LAMONT.

523
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,334
I BROUGHT PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

524
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,667
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

525
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,959
SHE NEVER LEAVES HER MAIL SITTING OUT THERE.

526
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,209
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES HAS SHE THROWN OURS AWAY

527
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,334
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PICK IT UP THE SECOND IT CAME?

528
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,792
HA HA.THAT WOULD BE FIVE.

529
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,250
I DON'T KNOW, TOM.

530
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,167
I THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HER.

531
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,751
OKAY, SO GO OVER AND CHECK ON HER.

532
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:24,209
BUT IF I'M WRONG, THEN I'M SUCKED

533
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,792
INTO A 2-HOUR CONVERSATION ABOUT BUNIONS.

534
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:27,876
DON'T GO CHECK ON HER.

535
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:29,959
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW, WHEN THEY FIND HER MUMMIFIED

536
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,876
CORPSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BASEMENT STAIRS,

537
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:33,125
WHAT DO I TELL THE KIDS?

538
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,167
"OH, YEAH, I LET MRS. McCLUSKEY DIE."

539
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,000
YEAH, AND WHY WOULD THEY CARE?

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,042
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO MISS THE DRY CLEANING COUPONS

541
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,626
SHE HANDS OUT ON HALLOWEEN.

542
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,834
TOM.

543
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,417
LISTEN, HONEY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

544
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,083
YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DO,YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DON'T,

545
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,584
SO, UH,GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,876
HONEY, I'M TRYING TO WATCH THE GAME.

550
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,083

SHH. TALK LATER.YOU'RE WATCHING THE GAME.

553
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:19,167
NO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW.

554
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,834
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY,SO WHAT'S THE STORY?

555
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,250
OH, YOU'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

556
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,125
GIRL MEETS BOY,BOY BUYS GIRL THINGS,

557
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,501
GIRL LEAVES HAPPY.

558
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,000
WHAT DID YOU DO?

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,042
YOU KNOW, I FORGOT HOW GENEROUS MEN COULD BE.

560
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:35,167
I ALSO FORGOT I HAVE OPTIONS --A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

561
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,375
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

562
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,876
I DON'T NEED YOUR CREDIT CARDS, CARLOS,

563
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:39,292
AND I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY,

564
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,167
BUT IF OUR MARRIAGE IS GOING TO WORK,

565
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,292
I NEED YOUR RESPECT.

566
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,751
I'M NOT RIPPING UP THE POST-NUP.

567
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:47,918
YES, YOU ARE.BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

568
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:50,959
I'M GOING TO PUT ON MY NEW SHOES AND WALK OUT THE DOOR.

569
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,459
YOU'RE THREATENING ME.

570
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,209
NO, I'M JUST POINTING SOMETHING OUT.

571
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,083
I'M A PRETTY GIRL,

572
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,167
AND PRETTY GIRLS ARE NEVER LONELY.

573
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,125

WELL, I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

577
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:28,501
NOT EVERYONE GETS TO REALIZE THEIR BLISS.

578
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,501
YEAH,IT CAN BE REWARDING.

579
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,042
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME?

580
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,042

00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,584
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED YOUR SCHNAPPS.

00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,834
THE PERFECT CAPPER TO THE PERFECT EVENING.

592
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,375
SO GOOD NIGHT.

593
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,584

MOM, HOLD IT!

00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,417
YOU ARE NOT GETTING INTO THE CAR ALONE WITH THOSE TWO.

601
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,584
YOU BARELY KNOW THEM.

602
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,792
I HAVE GREAT INSTINCTS ABOUT PEOPLE.

603
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,876
I ALWAYS HAVE, SUSIE.YOU KNOW THAT.

604
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,667
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED FOUR TIMES.

605
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,667
YES, BUT TWICE TO THE SAME GUY.

606
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:44,918
MOTHER.

607
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:47,626
SUSIE, PLEASE,YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.

608
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,417
OH, I'M EMBARRASSING YOU?

609
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,209
YES, AND I'VE HAD IT.

610
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,209
ALL NIGHT LONG,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

611
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:54,918
GET YOU TO STOP BEING SO CRABBY,

612
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,751
AND YOU REFUSE TO LET ME HELP.

613
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,667
AND -- AND YOUR IDEA OF HELPING

614
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,584
IS LETTING TIM JUST GROPE YOU?

615
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:04,375
HEY! YOU SHOULDN'T TALK TO YOUR MOTHER LIKE THAT.

616
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,501
SHE'S A FINE LADY.

617
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,125
TIM, COULD YOU JUST STAY OUT OF IT?

618
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,626
YEAH, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

619
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,417
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, PAL?

620
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,709
DUDE, YOU WERE FEELING UP HER MOTHER.

IT PISSED ME OFF, TOO.COME ON, SUSIE.

622
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,000
LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.

623
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,709
"LET'S GO BACK INSIDE"?LAMONT, GIVE IT UP.

624
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,042
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY.

625
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,501
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.

626
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,417
WHY ARE YOU BEING THIS WAY?

627
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,292
JUST -- I'M JUST TRYING TO LIGHTEN THINGS UP.

628
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:31,000
STOP ACTING LIKE TONIGHT WAS ABOUT HELPING ME.

629
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,250
YOU WANTED TO GO OUT AND HAVE FUN,

630
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,751
AND LAMONT OVER THERE NEEDED A DATE.

631
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,667
THAT'S NOT TRUE. OH, YES, IT IS.

632
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,542
OKAY, FINE, IT'S TRUE.

633
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,417
I WANTED TO GET OUT AND HAVE FUN.

634
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:44,667
WHY SHOULDN'T I?

635
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,584
YOU KNOW HOW DEPRESSED I'VE BEEN OVER MY BREAKUP WITH MORTY.

636
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:50,000
YEAH, I DO,AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO CRAZY.

637
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,918
YOU KNOW, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND I --

638
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:55,501
THAT YOU COULD BE HEARTBROKEN AND YOU CAN JUST MOVE ON,

639
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:59,000
AND I...AM JUST BROKEN.

640
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,792
I KNOW YOU'RE SAD.

641
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,250
NO, MOM, I'M NOT SAD.

642
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,083
AND I'M NOT CRABBY.

643
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:15,417
I'M DEVASTATED,AND YOU KEEP ACTING

644
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,083
LIKE ALL I NEED IS A COUPLE OF ASPIRIN.

645
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:21,626
MORTY WAS JUST ONE GUY IN A SERIES OF GUYS FOR YOU.

646
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:26,501
AND MIKE...HE WAS THE ONE.

647
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,626
WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT?

648
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:41,167
IT'S LYNETTE.HELLO?

649
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,834
MRS. McCLUSKEY?

650
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,417
MRS. McCLUSKEY.YOU ALL RIGHT?

651
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,542
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

652
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:54,792
UH, MR. MULLINS HAD A SPARE.

653
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,167
WHY DIDN'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR?

654
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,876
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT YOU'D GO AWAY.

655
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:04,501
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING YOUR ARTHRITIS MEDICATION?

656
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,334
I DON'T NEED TO.

657
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,375
SOMETIMES THE PAIN GOES AWAY BY ITSELF.

658
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,709
UH-HUH. IS THAT WHY YOU DIDN'T OPEN THE DOOR,

659
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,792
BECAUSE OF YOUR HANDS?

660
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,709
MRS. McCLUSKEY,DO YOU HAVE ANYO

661
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:22,000
THAT COULD HELP YOU OUT --A RELATIVE, A FRIEND?

662
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,334
I'M FINE.

663
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:31,667
OKAY.OKAY.

664
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,334
BEFORE YOU GO...

665
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:38,000
OPEN THESE, WOULD YOU? AND -- AND PUT OUT THE PILLS.

666
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,042
YEAH.

667
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:44,250
AND DON'T GET YOUR HANDS ALL OVER THEM.

668
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,125
GOD KNOWS WHAT YOUR KIDS HAVE PICKED UP.

669
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,751
LAST THING I NEED'S A CASE OF PINKEYE.

670
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:51,751
YOU'RE A PIECE OF WORK.YOU KNOW THAT?

671
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,792
WELL, THIS IS CRAZY.

672
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,250
WHY'D THEY GIVE YOU CHILDPROOF CAPS?

673
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,626
FIRST THING TOMORROW, I'M TAKING YOU TO THE PHARMACY,

674
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:59,000
AND WE'LL GET YOU NEW BOTTLES.

675
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,792
DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS. YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME.

676
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,375
I DON'T WANT YOU DOING ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU FEEL OBLIGATED.

677
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,751
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.HALF OF LIFE IS OBLIGATIONS.

678
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,459
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO YOUR HUSBAND'S

679
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:11,584
COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY, BUT YOU DO.

680
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,876
YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL CANDY

681
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,501
SO YOUR KID'S BAND CAN BUY PICCOLOS, BUT YOU DO IT.

682
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,459
YOU ATTEND YOUR THIRD COUSIN'S WEDDING.

683
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,918
YOU PICK UP THE DRY CLEANING.

684
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,042
THAT'S LIFE --IT'S OBLIGATIONS.

685
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:24,000
AND YOU ARE NOW MY OBLIGATION,

686
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,834
SO TOMORROW MORNING,I'LL PICK YOU UP,

687
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,792
AND WE'LL GO TO THE PHARMACY.

688
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:30,000
GEE, I'M TOUCHED BY YOUR OUTPOURING OF COMPASSION.

689
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,709
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE FRIENDS.

690
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,459
BUT WE'RE TWO HUMAN BEINGS

691
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,959
LIVING ON THE SAME PIECE OF EARTH.

692
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,334
WE CAN AT LEAST TRY

693
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,751
AND HELP EACH OTHER OUT ONCE IN A WHILE.

694
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:46,417
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

695
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,709
I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS.

696
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,375
FINE.

697
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:56,125
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

698
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,375
PICK ME UP A AT 9:00.

699
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,042
ANDREW, COME HERE.I WANT YOU TO SEE THIS.

700
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,542
UM, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

701
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,834
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR BABY PICTURES.

702
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,626
LOOK AT THAT ONE.

703
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:23,250
HOW OLD WAS I THERE?

704
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,000
JUST 4 WEEKS OLD.

705
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:36,501
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,BUT WHEN I GAVE BIRTH TO YOU,

706
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,042
THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS.

707
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:43,083
THE UMBILICAL CORD WRAPPED AROUND YOUR NECK,

708
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,542
AND YOU STOPPED BREATHING.

709
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,751
THE ROOM GOT VERY QUIET,

710
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,042
AND I KNEW YOU WERE IN TROUBLE.

711
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,000
SO I TURNED TO THE DOCTOR, AND I VERY CALMLSAID

712
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,417
THAT HE WAS NOT TOORRY ABOUT ME,

713
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,250
THAT HIS JOB WAS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

714
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,083
WHEN I SAY I WOULD DIE FOR YOU,

715
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,667
THAT'S NOT AN EXPRESSION.

716
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,626
I MEAN IT.

717
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:09,626
YEAH, WELL, UH...

718
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,042
I'M GOING TO GO EAT MY SANDWICH.

719
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:17,626
ANDREW, PLEASE,JUST GO AND TALK TO REVEREND SIKES.

720
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:18,417
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES --

721
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,542
HE CAN COUNSEL YOU. IT CAN HELP.

722
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,834
MOM, I DON'T NEED ANY HELP, ALL RIGHT?I'M FINE.

723
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,584
WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING ON ABOUT THIS?

724
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,417
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE,

725
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,834
THEN YOU WON'T GO TO HEAVEN.

726
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:42,417
YOU, UM...YOU -- YOU DON'T THINK I-I'LL GO TO HEAVEN?

727
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,876
NO, I DON'T.

728
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,125
AND I NEED YOU THERE.

729
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,167
I WOULD BE SO LONELY WITHOUT YOU.

730
00:36:54,959 --> 00:37:00,125
WELL...THEN I GUESS I BETTER GO TALK TO REVEREND SIKES.

731
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:04,501
OH, ANDREW.THANK YOU SO MUCH.

732
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,083
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO ME.

733
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,542
OH, MY -- MY GOSH.

734
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,125
UH, ARE YOU OKAY?

735
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,375
OH, YEAH, I JUST, UH, FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

736
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,375
I'M FINE.WHAT'S UP?

737
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,584
SUSAN STILL LOVES YOU.

738
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:27,751
WOW, UM...OKAY.

739
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,250
LOOK, THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

740
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,375
SHE JUST MISSES YOU SO MUCH.

741
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,167
SOPHIE, I JUST FOUND OUT

742
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,375
THAT SOMEONE I WAS VERY CLOSE TO IS DEAD.

743
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,751
I'VE REALLY GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,

744
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:42,417
SO I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT SUSAN RIGHT NOW.

745
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,751
SHE'S JUST VERY, VERY UNHAPPY,AND IF YOU COULD JUST --

746
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,375
I REALLY DON'T.

747
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,501
I'M SORRY.

748
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:27,584
I WON'T REVEAL A WORD

749
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,959
THAT'S SAID HERE TODAY.

750
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:31,501
NOW...

751
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,083
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

752
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,501
WELL, HERE'S THE THING --

753
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:39,083
I LIED TO MY PARENTS.

754
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,001
I'M NOT GAY.

755
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,626
YOU'RE NOT.

756
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,209
NOT REALLY.

757
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,334
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS

758
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:49,042
I WANTED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THAT CAMP,

759
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,751
SO I LIED TO MY PARENTS,

760
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,709
AND I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS REALLY WORRIED

761
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,042
THAT I WAS HAVING FEINGS FOR OTHER GUYS,

762
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,918
AND...THEY D EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED THEM TO.

763
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,209
THEY ARE SUCH TOOLS.

764
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:02,876
I'M SORRY,JUST SO I'M CLEAR --

765
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:06,042
ARE YOU A HETEROSEXUAL OR AREN'T YOU?

766
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,501
LOOK...

767
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:11,501
I LOVE VANILLA ICE CREAM,OKAY?

768
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,375
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN,

769
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,918
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE MOOD FOR CHOCOLATE.

770
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,959
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

771
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:25,959
I DO, BUT GOD WOULD PREFER YOU STICK TO THE VANILLA.

772
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,459
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

773
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,292
YOU DON'T.

774
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:32,167
NO.SORRY.

775
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,083
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER'S GOING TO BE DEVASTATED.

776
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,417
SHE'S BEEN PRAYING SO HARD FOR YOU TO CHANGE.

777
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,042
WELL, THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

778
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:43,542
I AM GOING TO CHANGE --BIG TIME.

779
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,167
I-I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

780
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,876
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT?

781
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,250
SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T THINK M GOING TO HEAVEN.

782
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,584
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

783
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:01,584
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

784
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:05,000
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KNOW PARADISE

785
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,584
IS BY REPENTING YOUR SINS.

786
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:11,792
WHEN SHE SAID THAT TO ME,

787
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,959
SUDDENLY IT HIT ME HOW I WAS GOING TO GET BACK AT HER.

788
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,459
FROM NOW ON,

789
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,001
I'M GOING TO BE SO GOOD.

790
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,501
I'M GOING TO EAT MY VEGETABLES,

791
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,375
I-I'M GOING TO GET GOOD GRADES,

792
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,334
I'M GOING TO SAY "YES, MA'AM"AND "NO, MA'AM."

793
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,209
I'M GOING TO MAKE HER BELIEVE

794
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:32,292
THAT GOD HAS DELIVERED HER THIS LITTLE MIRACLE.

795
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,834
UNTIL ONE DAY,

796
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:37,000
WHEN SHE LEAST EXPECTS IT,

797
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,584
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO AWFUL

798
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:43,959
IT IS GOING TO ROCK HER WORLD.

799
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:47,167
I MEAN, IT IS REALLY GOING TO DESTROY HER.

800
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:53,792
AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES...

801
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,334
I'LL KNOW PARADISE.

802
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,459
Mary Alice: YES,LIFE IS A JOURNEY,

803
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:17,292
ONE THAT IS MUCH BETTER TRAVELED WITH A COMPANION BY OUR SIDE.

804
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:21,918
OF COURSE, THAT COMPANION CAN BE JUST ABOUT ANYONE.

805
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:23,834
MRS. McCLUSKEY!

806
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,209
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR THE DOCTOR.

807
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:29,459
A NEIGHBOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET...

808
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:32,292
I'M COMING.JEEZ, HOLD YOUR WATER.

809
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,209
THERE YOU GO.

810
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:38,542
NO MORE POST-NUP.

811
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,083
OR THE MAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED.

812
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:51,375
THE COMPANION CAN BE A MOTHER WITH GOOD INTENTIONS...

813
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,542
THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL SERVICE, REVEREND.

814
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,876
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BREE.

815
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:57,792
OR A CHILD WHO'S UP TO NO GOOD.

816
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,375
VERY INSPIRATIONAL.

817
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,959
STILL, DESPITE OUR BEST INTENTIONS,

818
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,167
SOME OF US WILL LOSE OUR COMPANIONS ALONG THE WAY.

819
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:17,626
AND THEN THE JOURNEY BECOMES UNBEARABLE.

820
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:22,501
YOU SEE,

821
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:26,042
HUMAN BEINGS ARE DESIGNED FOR MANY THINGS,

822
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:32,501
BUT LONELINESS ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
