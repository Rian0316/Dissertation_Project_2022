00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,400
相信我
trust me.

133
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,650
我不能 Danny.
No,Danny.

134
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,290
我们做事的人可要万事小心 我们得要弄清楚底细才能找人加入
It's all our necks on the line and I,for one,like to know the people I'm working with.

135
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,330
我们下次再谈
We'll do this another time.

136
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,410
- 对不起 - 我做什么了
- Sorry,man. - What did I do?

137
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,010
你能给我解释一下吗 我是超支了4英镑
Can you please explain the logic to me,of us going ?overdrawn...

138
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,290
你们负责通知我的却收我85英镑?
and you charging me 85 to tell me about it?

139
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,690
好了 现在我超支89英镑了
Well,now I'm 89 overdrawn.

140
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,000
谢谢 再见
Thank you.Goodbye.

141
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,650
- 什么事 - 那人真是个变态
- Problem? - Yeah,the man is a moron.

142
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,360
- 他不变态怎么去做银行? - 好了 这种小事别记在心上
- It's a prerequisite for his profession. - Come on,don't let it get to you.

143
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,410
不是小事啊 Mickey 我想你帮我去打他一顿呢
No,Mickey,I want you to go and beat him up for me.

144
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,080
- 你发脾气了? - 对啊
- Are we having a tantrum? - Yes.

145
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,090
他那样子弄得我紧张兮兮的
Do you know,he's starting to make me feel nervous.

146
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,400
很明显我们来了之后他的营业额就一直下降
Yeah,well,apparently his profits have gone down since we got back.

147
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,720
这世道什么都离不开钱啊
Everything's about money these days.

148
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,360
欢迎光临
Welcome.

149
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,920
别谈起Mgube那单买卖 迟点再说
Don't mention Mgube.We'll talk about it later.

150
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,050
Eddie 这是Trevor.
Eddie,this is Trevor.

151
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,650
对不起
Sorry.

152
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,250
对不起 就谈一下
Oh,sorry,look,one word,all right.

153
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,880
- 我们谈谈原则 - 原则?
- Principle. - Principle?

154
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,050
- 是啊 就谈原则 - 说吧
- Yeah,principle,okay. - Go on.

155
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,200
- 我也是你们的一份子吧? - 是的
- I'm an equal partner. - Yeah.

156
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,730
- 我说话也是算话的? - 当然
- I'm entitled to my say. - Absolutely.

157
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,650
- 我跟你们是一样重要的吧? - 一样重要
- I got an equal voice. - Same as everyone else.

158
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,680
我加入之前你们每个人都是认识的
Okay,you lot all knew each other before I come along,all right.

159
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,050
但是我就是刚加入的
To me,it's like I'm on the outside looking in.

160
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,330
- Danny. - 就是说
- Oh,Danny. - Yeah,it's like...

161
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,690
我当时也是个外人吧
the kid with the nose pressed up against the window.

162
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,570
还是在说原则问题吧?
So this,it's all a matter of principle,yeah?

163
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,610
是吧 Ash 不就是因为我能帮上忙吗?
That's it,Ash,principle.Yeah.

164
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,970
我说了我会担保他的 我想 我说话
I said I'd vouch for the bloke,didn't I?I mean,I think my word...

165
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,050
还是能当一回事的吧 如果你连我都不信
should be vouchable.And if it's not,then....

166
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,520
如果真是那样 我只能走了 咱们拆伙好了
I guess what I'm saying is,if it's not,then I'm gonna have to walk.

167
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,770
我说完了
There you go,I've said it now.

168
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,730
我的意思是
I mean,sometimes a bloke has to stand up for...

169
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,930
用人不疑 疑人不用吧
what he stands for.

170
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,640
他说的有道理 他毕竟是我们的拍档 怎么也该相信他
He has a point.A little trust goes a long way.

171
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,770
好的 但是我们还不清楚他底细
Yeah,but we don't know him.

172
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,650
我们当初要Danny来帮忙的时候 还不是不清楚他的底细?
Well,we didn't know Danny when we took him on.

173
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,890
好的
Okay.

174
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,520
Danny
Danny.

175
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,090
我们给他次机会
Okay,we're gonna give him a chance on this one job.

176
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,450
如果第一次就搞砸了 他就走人
The first time he screws up,he's out.

177
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,250
干杯 谢谢 你们不会后悔的
Cheers,thanks,you won't regret it.

178
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,440
我当时没给你面子 我不是故意的
I didn't mean what I said and sorry about burping in your face.

179
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,600
爱死你们了
Love you all.

180
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,880
- 那Mgube的买卖怎么下手? - 就投其所好好了
- So,how do we get to this Mgube? - His hobby.

181
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,440
他出名爱收集古董钞票
He has a world-renowned collection of rare banknotes.

182
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,760
他身家丰厚
Yeah,he looks like he's worth a few quid.

183
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,450
有人估算过 他身家大概有6亿美元
Last time,it was estimated at $60 million.

184
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,010
- 那有多少个0啊 - 好多个罗
- How many noughts is that,then? - Lots.

185
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,600
那要怎么下手
And the way in?

186
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,690
他很想要找的一张古钞
He's desperate to add one new note to his collection.

187
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,050
叫Yankee Green
Yankee Green known because...

188
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,250
怎会有这名字 因为是绿色的?
It's green?

189
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,040
是的 就是绿色的 那是以前用造钞工艺 现在已经失传了
Extremely so,yes.It was a new color process that did not catch on.

190
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,210
就因为这 它也身价百倍
But that in itself adds to its value.

191
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,240
那是一张面值$1,000的钞票 1866年发行
It's a $1,000 treasury note issued in 1866.

192
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,330
上面有George Gordon Meade将军的头像...
The head is of General George Gordon Meade...

193
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,480
联邦军队指挥官的葛底斯堡战役
Commander of the Union Forces at the Battle of Gettysburg.

194
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,410
那东西值多少钱?
How much is something like that worth,then?

195
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,610
全世界只剩两张了
Only two are known to still be in existence.

196
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,410
芝加哥联合银行买下了一张
One is owned by the Chicago Confederate Bank...

197
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,810
9年前买的 花了$200,000英镑
for which they paid $200,000 nine years ago.

198
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,600
我想Mgube一直也要买但是没买成吧
And I take it that Mgube has offered to buy it and been turned down?

199
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,250
他的确一直想买到它
Frequently,yes.

200
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,010
那我们有什么法子?
So,where do we come in?

201
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,930
还有第二张
Now,the second note....

202
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,170
很少人知道它在哪
Only a handful of people know its whereabouts.

203
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,090
总算被我找到了
Fortunately,I'm one of them.

204
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,640
给它作保险的那家公司的CEO是我的朋友
The CEO of the company that insures it is a friend of mine.

205
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,960
你朋友还真多
Everyone's a friend of yours,Albie.

206
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,130
它现在在Anne Foster手上
The owner of the note is Anne Foster.

207
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,330
是他第二任丈夫留给她的遗物
It is kept in her late husband's collection.

208
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,850
Mgube还不知道这事吗?
But Mgube doesn't know anything about her?

209
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,160
他只知道第二张钞票被私人收藏了
He knows the second note belongs to a private collector...

210
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,320
但他找不到那收藏家
he just hasn't been able to track it down.

211
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,880
就算他找到了Foster 她也说过她不想把钞票卖掉
Even if he did,she's made it clear that she will never sell it.

212
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,130
好的 那么有个百万富翁想找一样 东西而我们又知道那东西在哪
Okay,so we got a millionaire who wants something and we know where it is.

213
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,370
- 那 又怎样呢 - 我们去偷吧
- Now,what? - Can't we just nick it?

214
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,210
我们能伪造一张吗?
Can we forge the note?

215
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,000
能是能 但是Mgube可能连钞票的序列号都知道
Possible.But chances are Mgube knows the serial number.

216
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,050
我们得先去看看那张真的
We'll need to see the real one.

217
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,000
- 就是说? - 我们要找到Foster看看那张真的
- Which means? - Getting close enough to the original.

218
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,880
Foster?
Mrs.Foster?

219
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,490
没什么事 我们只是想对你在我们 公司投保的几件贵重物品
No,it's nothing serious,Mrs.Foster,we'd simply like to update our assessment...

220
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,930
更新一下评估
on some of the more valuable items that we insure.

221
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,970
- 不是已经更新过了吗 - 不
- My premiums are up to date,you know. - No.

222
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,090
手续上还要再确认一次
No,it's more a case of making sure...

223
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,600
确保那些物品的状况
that some of the items are in the same condition as...

224
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,760
还有担保的价值
when the insurance was taken out.

225
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,010
我83岁了
I'm 83,you know.

226
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,370
不是吧 你看上去就像75岁
I don't believe that.You don't look a day over 75.

227
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,170
你还要蛋糕吗?
Would you like another slice of cake?

228
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,770
不要了谢谢 好了 我们开始
Maybe later.Anyway,moving on.

229
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,450
首饰 好的 应该没问题
Right,jewelry,that should be fine.

230
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,360
- 这上面写你还有些旧钞 - 是我死了的丈夫的
- I see here you have some banknotes. - My late husband's.

231
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,920
知道了 好的
Right,okay.

232
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,000
对这些宝贝可要千万小心
Always a danger of damp with those.

233
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,050
我把它们放在个密室里了
They're in a sealed cabinet.

234
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,170
可以让我们看一下吗?
Do you mind if we have a look?

235
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,050
我们还要准备一点东西
There are a few more things we need for the Mgube con.

236
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,400
只是好像我们的流动资金不足
But it seems we're short of working capital.

237
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,050
于是我就想...
And then I thought to myself...

238
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,250
我能叫谁帮忙呢?
who do I know who could solve a problem like that?

239
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,690
- 我们还缺些什么 - 这是清单
- What do we need? - I've got a list.

240
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,930
行了 不算太多拉
Cor blimey,you don't want much,do you?

241
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,730
- 我留着吧 - 好的
- Leave it with me. - Okay.

242
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,370
你在我们酒店过得愉快吗 先生?
Was everything all right with your stay,sir?

243
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,080

You did?Yeah,well,it may not have gone through.

252

你能提供那信用卡号 让我查一下吧

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,330
可能没有吧
Probably not....

260

我想我们要照些照片
I think we may have to take some photographs...

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,850
用来更新我们的资料 可以吗?

但是我已经储钱进我的帐户了
But I've paid money into the account now,so...

272
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,920
你还不能扣清我的贷款额吗?
couldn't you just take off the charges?

273
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,850
为什么?因为客人是上帝啊
A reason?Well,how about customer service?

274
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,480
再说 这样做也合情合理啊
Or just plain,old-fashioned bloody courtesy?

275
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,290
我不是说骂你 我是想说
I am not swearing at you,I'm just trying to point out...

276
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,050
你真他妈的臭男人长着个猪脑子啊?
that you're an arrogant little man with a brain the size of a pea.

277
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,120
喂 喂
Hello?Hello?

278
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,880
- 他挂电话了 - 他真是没礼貌啊
- He hung up. - I can't think why.

279
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,850
好 这么不给我面子
Right,this means war.

280
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,250
不就是85英镑吗 这有点小题大做了吧
It's 85,my dear.Isn't war a little overzealous?

281
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,730
这是原则问题
It's the principle.

282
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,690
又是原则 现在都流行讲原则啊
Principle again.It seems to be the word of the moment.

283
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,800
- 穿上衣服 Albie. - 干什么?
- Get your coat,Albie. - Why?

284
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,040
我们要动手了
Because we are gonna get him.

285
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,450
- 整他? - 那个叫Hopkins的
- Get him? - Hopkins.

286
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,810
他见过我 所以我不能去 不过你可以帮我
Yep,he knows me but you can be my secret weapon.Come on.

287
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,290
对不起Reeves小姐 我们处理办法不复杂
Look,be that as it may,Mrs.Reeves,we have a very simple system here.

288
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,930
我简单给你说一下
Let me unscramble the intricacies of it for you.

289
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,890
你帐户有钱 你才能取钱出来
If you have money in your account,you can take it out.

290
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,490
- 但是你没有 - 孩子 走吧
- You haven't. - Come on,kids.

291
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,050
Hopkins?我叫Harrison Wyngate
Mr.Hopkins?Harrison Wyngate.

292
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,410
- 请进 - 谢谢
- Please. - Thank you.

293
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,050
- 让我来开 - 好的
- Let me. - Fine.

294
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,920
好的 下一步 要对付了Mgube
Okay,next step,Mgube.

295
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,530
我们跟他租车的公司有联络
We've got a contact in the limousine company he's using...

296
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,000
所以我们知道他今天下午会到Strand 的一家古董钞票商那去
so we know he's due to visit the banknote dealers in the Strand this afternoon.

297
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,730
- 我们能搞好的 对吧 Trev? - 对
- We can do that,can't we,Trev? - Yeah.

298
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,890
他今天对付那老太太的时候出色极了
He did really good today,Mick,with the old girl.

299
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,490
- 你跟人合伙骗过人吗? - 我只是听说过
- Have you ever worked on a long con? - I've read about it.

300
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,610
行了 好了 我去办这事 他给我做帮手得了
Yeah,well,I'll make the play,he'll just back me up.

301
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,210
那你还不如带上Ash
I'd rather you took Ash.

302
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,680
好的 Mick 你是老板 当然你说了算
All right,Mick,you're the boss,it's your call,but....

303
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,720
要不是有人教我 我也不会有今天啊
I mean,I wouldn't be sitting here,would I,if somebody hadn't taught me?

304
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,770
别把事搞砸了
Do not louse this up.

305
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,570
我们不会的
No,we won't.

306
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,600
要转帐是没问题的 你有在这开过户吗?
Setting up a transfer is no problem.Do you have an account here?

307
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,930
没有 外面的小姐给了我一张表格要我填
No,not yet but the young lady out there gave me the forms to fill out.

308
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,160
我们批准你的申请之后 就会把银行帐号给你
Once your application has been processed we can give you an account number...

309
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,730
到时你就可以转帐了
so you can arrange the transaction.

310
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,330
你打算要转帐多少钱呢?
Do you know how much you'll be transferring?

311
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,810
3百万
3 million,yes.

312
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,970
- 不好意思? - 这是启动基金
- Excuse me? - That's just the first installment.

313
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,400
- 启动基金? - 我所代表的公司
- First? - Yes,the company I represent...

314
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,400
将购入这边的地皮进行投资
has purchased some land nearby to develop.

315
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,120
我们要开户来进行资金调动
So we need a holding account,pay the construction staff,that sort of thing.

316
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,050
我想你们这样规模的银行能处理这种业务吧
Well,I'm assuming a branch this size can deal with that amount of money?

317
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,330
可以
Of course.

318
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,250
我就说了 有像你们这样的银行给我们做担保
I've always believed that having a strong relationship...

319
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,250
我们办起事来也会容易一点
with the branch you're dealing with makes life a lot easier.

320
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,930
再大一点规模的银行总部之类的话 手续就太麻烦了
Head offices can be so tedious.

321
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,080
对的
Quite.

322
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,920
说了这么多
Well,it'll be quite a coup for you,I guess.

323
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,210
这单生意能让你业绩增加不少的
I'm sure your superiors will be impressed.

324
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,800
手续一办妥 Wyngate先生...
Well,rest assured,Mr.Wyngate...

325
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,450
你就能享受我们银行的服务了
the bank and I will be at your complete disposal.

326
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,730
那就好
Lovely,brilliant.

327
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,250
好了我骗他入局了 你想要怎么做?
Well,now that I've got him,what shall we do with him?

328
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,730
我要想想
I'll think of something.

329
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,490
你当然要想了 我想你也会的
I'm sure you will,my dear,I'm sure you will.

330
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,050
- 我们到过不同的钞票商里去调查 - 你们是关税调查科?
- We're calling on all banknote dealers. - Customs and Excise?

331
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,410
是的 我们调查过你的帐户 你们当然是没什么问题的
Yeah,this is absolutely nothing to do with your business.

332
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,210
我们来也不是调查你们公司
We've checked your accounts.Everything seems fine.

333
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,960
我们来是想监视我们的调查对象
Just to let you know,we'll be here as part of our surveillance.

334
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,130
调查对象?
Surveillance?

335
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,650
对 有帮洗黑钱的团伙
Yeah,there's a money laundering gang,taking money out of the country...

336
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,810
喜欢把黑钱投资到古董硬币跟纸币上
by investing in rare coins and banknotes.

337
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,330
好了 你想我怎么做?
So,what do you want me to do?

338
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,880
没什么
Oh,nothing.No.

339
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,250
就当我们没来过调查
Just pretend we're not here and if anyone asks...

340
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,320
如果有人问起 就说我们是这的员工
then we're just members of staff.

341
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,770
但是我们不能让陌生人随便出入的
But I can't possibly have strangers wandering around the shop.

342
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,170
你既然不合作
Oh,well,should you decide not to help with our investigation...

343
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,330
是不是意味着 你这公司有些问题呢?
we would have to ask ourselves,why?

344
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,450
没有 当然没有 我会尽力协作你们的
No,of course,please.I'll help in any way I can.

345
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,800
好 那就好 谢谢
Well,that's super,that really is super,thank you.

346
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,730
你愿意先到后面的办公室去吗?
Perhaps you could wait in the back office?

347
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,410
几个小时应该就好了
Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.

348
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,290
- 你好 - Danny.
- Hello. - Danny.

349
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,410
Mgube车到了
Mgube's car is just pulling up outside.

350
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,560
好的
Okay.

351
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,810
Harris先生 谢谢你的来电
Mr.Harris,thank you for calling back,sir.

352
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,930

354
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,490
没问题 我很乐意这样做
That's my pleasure,sir.That is not a problem,sir.

355
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,600
那张Yankee Green?
The Yankee Green?

356
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,090
是找到了
Have located it.

357
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,640
但是还没联络到收藏的人
Not managed to get hold of the owner yet,though.

358
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,960
当然的 我会第一时间给你电话的
Absolutely,sir.I'll let you know as soon as I know.

359
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,610
再见
Goodbye,sir.

360
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,570
请问一下 刚才你说的是Yankee Green吗?
Excuse me,did I hear you mention the Yankee Green?

361
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,850
- 什么? - 你谈电话的时候
- Sir? - You spoke about it on the telephone.

362
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,010
不好意思 先生 我不能透露其他客人的消息
I'm sorry,sir.I can't discuss orders from other clients.

363
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,690
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

364
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,770
我会买很多这里的收藏的
I'm here to purchase a large number of notes.

365
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,080
好的 那请你先看一下我们的产品目录吧
Well,maybe you'd like to have a little look at our catalogue?

366
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,370
不用了 我想你带它到我的住处去
No.I would like you to bring it to my apartment...

367
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,960
你一个小时后亲自带来
in person,in one hour.

368
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,120
我不知道能不能这样做
Not quite sure I'm gonna be able to do that.

369
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,680
你的收入是按提成的吧?
I take it you earn commission on your sales?

370
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,050
是的
Yes,I do.

371
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,810
我可要在你这花大钱的喔

你去哪了?
Where've you been?

374
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,850
- Mickey叫我帮他准备些东西 - 搞好了吗?

375
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,930
- 好 好的 - 好 我有另外一件事要你办

376
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,090
不是吧 我也不知道自己这么重要
Cor blimey,I've never been so popular.

377
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,250
没 有件私事想你帮帮忙
Well,it's more of a personal favor.

378
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,760
说吧
Go on,then.

379
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,730
Stacie跟我都想你把这些凑合 起来做一份建筑规划
Stacie and I would like you to turn these into proper building plans.

380
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,320
用来干吗?
What for?

381
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,610
没什么拉 不过对Stacie可是很重要的事喔
Much as I'd love to tell you,it's more than my life is worth,dear boy.

382
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,280
好了 记得你要怎么做吗?
Right,you know what you're doing,yeah?

383
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,090
沉默就是金 我不该说话的时候就不说话
Silence is golden.Egg you on when I need to.

384
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,730
你一要走我就要拦住你
Get the hump when you move towards the door.

385
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,410
对了 就是那样
That's it,good luck.

386
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,530
你好
All right?How you doing?

不
No.

391
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,250
他明天要签的话就给他钱
Offer him money as long as he agrees to sign by tomorrow.

392
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,010
如果他不签
If that doesn't work...

393
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,050
告诉小心他夫人和孩子的性命
then tell him I asked after his wife and children.

394
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,040
好的
Good.

395
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,010
你好

我带目录来了 这是我助手James
I've brought the catalogue for you,sir.This is my assistant,James.

397
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,690
我对你的目录没兴趣
I am not interested in your catalogue,young man.

398
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,850
我想要的是Yankee Green
I want to talk about the Yankee Green.

399
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,120
我说过了 先生...
Did explain that,sir...

400
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,730
人家出什么价都不要紧
I will match whatever your other client is willing to pay.

401
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,880
不好意思 先生...

402
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,330
事成了我给你20万
And give you 20,000 for yourself.

403
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,490
我想我们不该再谈下去了
I really don't think we should be having this conversation,sir.

404
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,890
每人20万
Each.

405
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,570

你说的是20万 每人吗?
You did say 20,000,each?

407
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,490
好了
At last.

408
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,850
终于肯了吧
Gentlemen in this country I can do business with.

409
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,850
好的
Okay.

410
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,290
那客人开价多少?
So,what is your other client's offer?

411
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,530
50万
500,000.

412
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,880
好的 把钞票带过来

你叫Albert出马有些太夸张了吧

468
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,810
谁叫他和他那么丁点的银行
Disproportionate to the 85...

这是零售区 电影区 娱乐区
This is the main retail area,cinema complex,theater district.

472

政府那边其实也不会有什么问题的
The council has given us virtually carte blanche.

- 我想也是喔 - 6星期后土建就动工了

还剩下这么一块没买下来
And this is the only section that hasn't been acquired.

479
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,450
地方不大 却很重要 建成之后可是停车场的入口
Small but crucial.It will give us the best access to the car parks.

480
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,370
- 它现在是谁的? - 我不知道
- Who does it belong to? - I have no idea.

481
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,240
我们也不要管 停车场的承建已经让人家中标了
Fortunately,it's not our problem.We've put the car parking out to franchise.

482
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,040
不过不管是谁 这地到时可是很值钱的
But whoever owns it,they're about to be offered an awful lot of money.

That's what I'm talking about,that,all that jiggery-pokery.

- 公平的机会 - 对啊

好了 这是钞票
Yeah.Here's the note.

522
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,850
Ray说这只是看上去很像 化学测试是通不过的
Ray says it'll stand up to a visual but not if they run chemical tests.

523
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,730
一见到有试管之类的东西 马上说怀疑这钞票是假的
So the first sign of a test tube,complain about damaging the note...

524
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,770
- 马上走 - 知道了

好了 祝我们好运
Right.Wish us luck.

527
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,080
如果你是厉害的 你就不要我祝福你
If you're good enough,you won't need it.

528
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,410
等一下 我给你60了 你却只出了50喔
Hang on,if I gave you 60 and you only put 50 in...

529
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,610
我又被耍了一道
I must be a tenner down.

530
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,850
好了 我去跟他谈
It's all right,I'll toss him for it.

- 我来说 - 知道了

533
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,890
记得Mickey说的 他们要是想要做化学测试
Like Mickey says,if he gets out some fancy testing kit...

534
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,610
- 我们马上想个借口走人 - 好的
- we make our excuses and we leave. - Right.

535
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,650
更重要的是 要表现得 紧张一点
The most important thing,all right,is to look a bit nervous...

536
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,880
好像我们不该去的
like we know we shouldn't be there.

537
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,770
他也知道我们真的这样做的话我们会失业的
He knows what we're doing could cost us our jobs.

538
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,160
就让他觉得他看穿了我们
Let's make him think he's doing all the running.

539
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,890
- 好的 - 你准备好了?
- Right. - You ready?

540
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,810

00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,560
- 不是吧 不见了 - 什么意思 不见了?
- Oh,no.It's gone. - What do you mean,it's gone?

542
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,530
我一定是把它落在酒吧了
I must have left it in the bar.

543
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,490
没 当时你就放进口袋了
No,you didn't leave it in the bar,you put it in your pocket.

544
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,040
- 我肯定掉了 - 没 你没掉 找一找
- I must have dropped it. - No,you didn't drop it,have a look.

545
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,360
不是吧 明明放好了的
I don't believe it,I put it in me pocket.

546
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,810
我也不相信啊
I don't believe you.

547
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,680
好了 别慌
All right,don't panic.

548
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,320
想想 好了 我们往回走 找找看
Focus.Right,let's retrace our steps.

549
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,560
- 好的 找找 - 怎么会这样
- Well,look then. - I don't believe this.

550
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,650
好好找 别再说话
Just get looking and stop with your bloody whining.

551
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,760
等一下 不是吧?
Hold on.What?

552
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,290
- 我发誓我放我口袋了 - 他掉了?
- I put it in my pocket,I swear. - He's dropped it,ain't he?

553
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,890
在我们去的路上
He's dropped it somewhere between here and the apartment.

554
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,650
我们也找过了 但是没找到
We've retraced our steps,but someone's picked it up.

555
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,010
死蠢Danny 你说你会担保他的
Of all the stupid....Danny,you said you'd vouch for him.

556
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,320
对 我说过 Mickey 这是谁都可能犯的错啊
Yeah,all right,Mickey,it could happen to anyone.

557
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,970
又不见我犯 就他犯?
Only it didn't,did it?It happened to him.

558
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,330
我们再弄一张吧?
Can we get another one made?

559
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,050
来不及了 Mgube 明天就走
No,not in the time.Mgube's flying back tomorrow.

560
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,960
- 那玩完罗? - 对 没办法了
- So we're finished? - Yeah,afraid so.

561
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,770
你不知道 你刚浪费我们多少钱了吧
Do you have any idea how much money you've just cost us?

562
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,450
好了 我也浪费了啊
All right.I've lost out as well,you know.

563
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,210
你一分钱没用过
You didn't put any money in to set this up.

564
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,570
我们可是在这上面花了好几千的 还要等机会
Got half a million quid just sitting there,waiting to be picked up.

565
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,160
- 让他离开这里 - 等等
- Get him out of here. - Hold on.

566
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,490
听着 你还是走吧
Listen,maybe you'd better go.

567
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,930
- 这不全怪我啊 - 我说了 你走吧
- This ain't just down to me. - I said,"Get him out."

568
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,970
走就是了
Hey,just go.Come on.

569
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,480
- 走啊 - 走
- Just go. - Out,get out.

570
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,130
好的 我走
All right.I'm leaving.

571
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,800
走拉
Get out.

572
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,010
混人
Losers.

573
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,320
喂
Hey.

574
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,200
好了 放下牌一下 我的腿好痛啊
Okay,just put the cards down flat for a second.My leg.

575
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,850
没跟他们玩牌?
Not playing cards with the boys?

576
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,570
Albert出老千
No,Albert cheats.

577
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,650
- 对阿 - 满开心的 跟Trevor一起
- Yeah,he does. - It's funny,isn't it?With old Trevor.

578
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,290
- 什么意思 - 不久之前
- What do you mean? - Weren't that long ago...

579
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,840
- 我跟他其实也是一样 - 别乱说
- I weren't that much different from him. - Don't be ridiculous.

580
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,010
- 你跟他一点都不像 - 不 我只做小买卖
- You're nothing like him. - No,short con artist...

581
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,930
- 骗点小钱过活 - 不是那样的 Danny他很贱
- scratching a living. - No way,Danny.He's cheap.

582
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,490
什么东西都离不开钱
Everything's about the money.

583
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,890
所以他领略不了这游戏的美感
So he misses the beauty of the game.

584
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,610
美感?
The beauty?

585
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,000
你就是美的
You know,you're beautiful.

586
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,570
谢谢
Thank you.

587
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,290
- 我能问你些事吗 - 什么?
- Can I ask you something? - I suppose so.

588
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,920
你一直拒绝我
You keep knocking me back,yeah.

589
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,490
是因为 听我说 是因为
Now,is it because....No,listen,is it because....

590
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,640
是因为我们一起工作吗?
Is it because we work together...

591
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,130
- 还是因为你根本对我没兴趣 - 你说呢
- or is it because you don't fancy me? - What do you think?

592
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,130
我以前也是以为因为我们一起工作 后来我想
I used to think it was 'cause we worked together and then I got thinking...

593
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,800
可能是因为
maybe...

594
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,210
我不是你喜欢的类型
I'm just not your type.

595
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,640
你觉得我喜欢什么类型呢?
And what do you think my type is,then?

596
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,130
我不知道
I don't know.

597
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,410
像Mickey一类吧
Somebody more like Mickey.

598
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,450
像Mickey的 还是就是Mickey啊?
Like Mickey or Mickey specifically?

599
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,800
我怎么知道呢
Well,why don't you tell me?

600
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,930
- 你们两我都爱 - 我们两你都爱?
- I love you both. - You love us both?

601
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,210
我们两你都爱的话
Yeah,but loving us both...

602
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,520
女生不是只要爱一个的吗
that's just one of those girly things,isn't it...

603
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,650
有些时候你不想去爱人
when you don't want to shag someone...

604
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,650
但有不想伤害到他
but you don't want to hurt their feelings,either...

605
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:49,170
你就把他当成只是好朋友 并且你不想破坏这份友谊
so you pretend you're just good friends and you don't want to spoil it.

606
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,960
我也不是太懂女人
So,just so I'm absolutely crystal clear on this,yeah...

607
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,570
我跟你是没戏的罗?
a shag is definitely out of the question?

608
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,450
- 你不介意我问问吧 - 不介意 我还挺高兴你问的
- You don't mind me asking,though? - No,I'm flattered,Danny.

609
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,240
好了 谢谢你肯跟我谈
Thanks for our little chat and...

610
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,690
还没损我
no offense.

611
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,930
当然不会啦
None taken.

612
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,690
不是 交易还没完 只是他有些担心 没什么的
No,listen the deal's still on,it's just that he's got cold feet,that's all.

613
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,610
- 你有那张票子罗 - 有的
- You definitely have the note? - Yeah.

614
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,680
什么时候给我
When can I have it?

615
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,280
明天早上10点前给你
I can have the note to you by 10:00 tomorrow.

616
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:55,050
- 10点 - 你准备好钱了吧
- 10:00 is okay. - And you'll have the money ready?

617
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,840
这你就不用担心了
Do not worry,young man.

618
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,330
- 明早10点 - 好的
- Tomorrow at 10:00,then. - Good.

619
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,440
再见
Bye.

620
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,680
那班傻冒
Muppets.

621
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,520
- Foster女士 - 什么?
- Mrs.Foster. - Yes?

622
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,410
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

623
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,250
事情是这样的 Foster女士...
The thing is,Mrs.Foster...

624
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,530
我们看那些照片的时候 发现
when we studied the photographs we've discovered...

625
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,730
- 那钞票有点破损了 - 破损
- that the note has been damaged. - Damaged?

626
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,410
那是不可避免的了 所以我们觉得出价购买了这张钞票
Irretrievably,I'm afraid.Which is why we've decided to pay out.

627
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,450
什么意思?我想我该给我孩子打个电话
I don't understand.Perhaps I should telephone my son.

628
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,130
不用拉
No,there's no need for that.

629
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,890
我来也是带钱给你
All I'm here for is to give you a little bit of money.

630
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,120
- 为什么 - 为了那张钞票啊
- What for? - For the damaged note.

631
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,050
对不起 我还是没搞懂
I'm sorry,I'm afraid I still don't quite understand.

632
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,250
听着
Listen...

633
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,370
你记得我们拍了些照片吧?
you remember,we came to do some photographs,on the note?

634
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,090
我们发现那钞票有破损了
Well,the note has been damaged,darling.

635
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,370
我们公司觉得你也会糊涂的
The company thought you might find this all confusing.

636
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,730
这是15万现金
150,000 in cash.

637
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,850
是作为赔偿的
It's a sort of down payment to make you feel a little bit better.

638
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,490
你要在这上面签字
I just need you to sign this.

639
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,730
- 我要用私章吗? - 不用了 就签个名就好了
- I need my spectacles. - No,it's all right,it's just one signature.

640
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,040
在这
Right there.

641
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,010
当然 我要把钞票带走喔
Of course,I will have to take the note back with me.

642
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,730
我得给Peter打个电话
I have to call Peter.

643
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,650
说到银行 钱啊 保险啊 我是一窍不通的
I don't understand when it comes to banks,money,and insurances.

644
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,530
我得跟我儿子说一声
I really would like to talk to my son.

645
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,000
我对你说的也不是很懂
I'm not quite sure that I understand what you mean.

646
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,640
你已经卖给我了
Well,you've already sold it to me,haven't you?

647
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,410
你不记得拉?全都合法的 钱在这
Don't you remember?All legal,money's there.

648
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,760
我没卖什么啊
I'm not selling anything.

649
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,290
Blimey 你真健忘了
Blimey,you're getting forgetful,aren't you,sweetheart?

650
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,210
我走了 不送
I'll see myself out.

651
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,890
等一下 我不知道我要不要这样
Please,I don't think I want to do this.

652
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,650
Mgube在等我
Mr.Mgube's expecting me.

653
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,890
Mgube先生
Mr.Mgube.

654
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,170
- 带来了? - 对
- You have it? - Yeah.

655
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,370
你准备好钱了?
Do you have the money?

656
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,490
说好的50万英镑
500,000,as agreed.

657
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,970
- 另外50万呢? - 你同事又没来
- And the extra 50,000? - Your colleague is no longer with you.

658
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,290
那我就连他那份也要了
Which means I get his share.

659
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,720
钞票呢
The note.

660
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,930
给他
Pay the man.

661
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,210
跟你做生意真是愉快
It's been a real pleasure doing business with you gents.

662
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,970
- 你们在干大买卖 - 我觉得
- Something's going on. - I reckon...

663
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,850
应该就是现在了
about now.

664
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,480
- 我能帮你吗? - 我找Foster女士
- Can I help you? - I'm here to see Mrs.Foster.

665
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:10,250
- 谁? - Foster女士 她住这的
- Who? - Mrs.Foster,she lives here.

666
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,610
- 不是啊 没这个人 - 那你是谁
- No,she doesn't. - So,who the hell are you?

667
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,410
我住这里的 这是我的房子啊
I live here,this is my house.

668
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,530
- 什么? - 我们刚放假回来
- What? - We've just come back off holiday.

669
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,010
- 怎么样 Betty? - 还是该叫你Foster女士?
- How'd we do,Betty? - Or should we call you Mrs.Foster?

670
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,890
15万
150,000.

671
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,250
- 不是吧 - 这么多
- You're joking. - No way.

672
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,640
我们想最多就2万 2万5
We only had him down for 20,000,25,000 tops.

673
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,010
看来这小家伙全付身家放进去了
Seems the little shit was holding out on you.

674
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,450
我们也猜想他会有些钱的
Well,that's what we thought he had stashed in the caravan,but....

675
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,050
他也没让我们失望
Seems he came into a small windfall.

676
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,890
喂?
Hello?

677
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,440
对了
Yeah,it is.

678
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,050
我们的银行经理
Our favorite bank manager...

679
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,690
买下了他的旅行车
must have bought his worthless caravan...

680
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,080
和他那块地
and even more worthless land for....

681
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,530
15万啊?
150,000 in cash.

682
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,160
我想问一下 停车场的土建工程谁中标了?
Yes,I'm trying to find out who's won the car parking franchise...

683
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,480
就是那个Portway Estate 公司的开发项目
for the new development on the Portway Estate?

684
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,690
什么没有?那个开发项目啊
What do you mean,"what development"?

685
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,170
给我转去 规划局
Let me talk to the Planning Officer.

686
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,930
教你一招
Here's the note.

687
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,010
最重要的是要做的好像有点紧张似的
The most important thing,all right,is to look a bit nervous...

688
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,920
就像我们知道我们不该去
like we know we shouldn't be there.

689
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,080
他也知道我们这样做会丢了工作的
He knows what we're doing could cost us our jobs.

690
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,450
就让他这样想吧
Let's make him think he's doing all the running.

691
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,410
- 好了 - 你准备好了?
- Right. - You ready?

692
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,890
有什么问题
What's wrong?

693
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,560
- 不是吧 不见了 - 什么意思 他不见了
- Oh,no.It's gone. - What do you mean,it's gone?

694
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,160

你会整晚都很high 不是因为香槟
You will be up all night...

750
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,010
因为你会跟你最喜爱的孙子跳舞
