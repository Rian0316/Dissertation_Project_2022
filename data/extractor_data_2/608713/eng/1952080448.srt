1
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,885
Double sixes again.

2
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,332
I don't believe it.

3
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:35,090
Come on. Thank you very much,
do you want another go?

4
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,966
Come on, what?

5
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,562
You're bound to win sooner or later.
I just got a bit lucky, that's all.

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,607
Been a long time since
I've seen anyone work the tat.

7
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,322
-Sorry, mate, do I know you?
-I was watching.

8
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,803
Pretty good.

9
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:02,405
Just got a bit lucky, that's all.

10
00:01:57,613 --> 00:02:00,764
All I'm saying is I'm wise
to all your tricks now, that's all.

11
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,969
-Is that right?
-Yes, definitely.

12
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,131
-The man's got 20-20 vision.
-He's seen the light.

13
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,249
My profits went up
when you lot went away.

14
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,483
I reckon you've been
cheating me for years.

15
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,645
-Eddie, how can you say that?
-Because it's true.

16
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:20,451
Can we at least have our drinks?

17
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,922
I feel like we've been waiting here
at least 20 minutes.

18
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,492
You've only just got here.

19
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:28,208
Feels like 20 minutes to me. Does it not
feel like 20 minutes to you, Mickey?

20
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:29,362
It feels like 20 minutes to me.

21
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,331
-Maybe the man doesn't want our money.
-No wonder his profits are down.

22
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:35,883
How much would you say they were
down by, Eddie? As much as, say, 20%?

23
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:39,363
-Twenty percent? That's a bit harsh.
-You know what, I bet it is 20.

24
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,568
-Twenty?
-Yeah.

25
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,166
That much?

26
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,649
If Eddie says it's 20, then 20 it must be.

27
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,201
-Twenty percent, who'd have thought?
-Yeah, well...

28
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,363
no more, so you'd better get used to it.

29
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:57,047
-Five, 10.... 10 makes--
-Twenty.

30
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,489
-Thanks very much, Eddie.
-Thanks, sweetheart.

31
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,812
-Edward.
-Albert.

32
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,606
-Well?
-We're on.

33
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,128
Do us a coffee, Eddie, stick it on the slate.

34
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:21,171
No more slates, strictly cash.

35
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:24,290
-Oh, not again.
-The worm has finally turned.

36
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,922
Albert says the mark's ready.
We're good to go.

37
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:30,330
Great. So where's Danny?

38
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:31,847
You were a dip?

39
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,163
No, I was the best dip in London.

40
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,332
You were the best dip, were you?

41
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:39,643
Telling you, mate, there's no one
like me before or since.

42
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,452
-Oh, yeah, your were that good?
-I was better than that.

43
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,129
-Brilliant.
-Go on, then, let's have a look, show us.

44
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,607
-You want me to show you?
-Yeah.

45
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,808
I'll show you.

46
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,208
-First of all, hang on, you got the time?
-Yep.

47
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,562
Where did you.... There wasn't....

48
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,371
That's good, that's good. All right, yeah.

49
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:02,605
-Anyway, so who's gonna get the bill?
-When did....

50
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,410
That was in me pocket.
I was sat down on it.

51
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,644
Don't worry, mate, don't worry,
we'll get a check. You got a pen?

52
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,973
Listen, you gotta look after yourself,
ain't you, in this game...

53
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,851
-'cause no one's gonna do nothing for you.
-You don't have to tell me.

54
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,163
You don't have to tell me,
I was scraping around for years...

55
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,925
-before anyone would give me a shot.
-Yeah?

56
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,571
Come here.

57
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,250
Top knowing you, top man,
see you around.

58
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,368
Yeah, good seeing you.

59
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,488
Listen, where you going?

60
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,803
-I'm just going off to find a cab.
-Yeah, I'll come with you.

61
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:34,962
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

62
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,247
All right.

63
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,803
Listen, we could team up, me and you...

64
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,167
you know, double bubble.

65
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,244
No, I don't work the short con anymore.

66
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,971
-Why not?
-Moved on, didn't I?

67
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,486
-Yeah?
-Bigger and better things.

68
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:50,248
-Like what?
-I joined up with a long con crew last year.

69
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:52,251
-The long con?
-Yep.

70
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,968
-That's big money, ain't it?
-Can be.

71
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,888
-Can you get me in?
-No, sorry, mate, it's not my call.

72
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:02,768
Right, so, someone gives you a leg up...

73
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,686
-and then you shut the door behind you.
-It's not like that, it's just...

74
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,970
-they're my crew that's all.
-Just a gofer, is you?

75
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:13,488
No, I'm not. I'm an equal partner.

76
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,291
An equal partner
who ain't got a say in nothing.

77
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,567
Shut up.

78
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,325
Listen, forget it, I'm gonna go.

79
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,768
Next time you're in Neasden,
give us a bell.

80
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:26,050
-All right. Neasden?
-Yeah?

81
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:29,529
-That's my old manor.
-Well, it's mine now.

82
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:32,165
Evelyn's caf still there?

83
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:34,928
Yeah, broke me tooth
on one of her burgers last week.

84
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:36,446
What about the Blue Boy Pub?

85
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,802
Yeah, still a dive.
Come on round, I'll buy you a pint.

86
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:46,365
No, wait. Let's have another drink.

87
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:55,889
-Still no sign of Danny, then?
-He's not answering his phone.

88
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,163
He'll be here. Time we got started.

89
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:05,924
Anthony Mgube, born in Nigeria,
resides in Switzerland.

90
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:09,842
Not a very nice man by any criteria
you choose to apply.

91
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:14,290
His reputation in the army
was for torturing prisoners.

92
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,488
He left the army
and joined the government...

93
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,732
then he fled to Switzerland...

94
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,930
following allegations
of embezzlement and fraud.

95
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:27,810
He sells arms to militia groups
and mercenaries in East Africa.

96
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:31,804
He has two main passions in his life...

97
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,930
his racing stables in Newmarket...

98
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,649
and his collection of antique banknotes.

99
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,364
All right. How's it hanging?

100
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:56,605
Listen, I want you to all meet
my new best friend, Trevor....

101
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,452
-Speed.
-Speed. There's Acie, Stash...

102
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:02,001
-Albert, that's the lovely Albert.
-All right.

103
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,970
No, he's the lovely Albert.

104
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,012
Legend, take note,
this is the great Mickey Bricks...

105
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,607
con man extraordinaire, all round top....

106
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,446
-Don't do that, Mickey.
-A word, please, Danny?

107
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,684
All right, I'll be right back, Trev.
I'll be back, Trev....

108
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:19,764
What the bloody hell do you think
you're playing at?

109
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,809
It's Trevor, isn't it?
Trevor Speed, he's one of us.

110
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:22,928
You're drunk.

111
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,573
-I've just had a couple, all right.
-What have you told him?

112
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,043
It's okay, all right, listen, he's a grifter...

113
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,129
I caught him working the tat.

114
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:33,249
You do not bring people here.

115
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,452
If there's a problem....

116
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,127
There's no problem here, mate,
no problem here. Okay.

117
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,612
Yes, there is a problem.

118
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,690
Why don't you just lighten up, Mickey?

119
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:46,446
Lighten up, will you? He's not just some
muppet I found on the street.

120
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,286
-I'm telling you, he's one of us.
-I very much doubt that.

121
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:53,885
Mickey, you're making me look
very bad here, all right, I invited him.

122
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,804
Please don't make me look very bad...

123
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,249
'cause then I'll feel bad.
All right, I'll vouch for him. Okay?

124
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,206
-We don't know anything about him.
-Yeah, well, I do, all right.

125
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:06,411
And you said yourself we needed
somebody for the Gooby Dooby thing.

126
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:11,365
-Mgube.
-And that as well. Look, I'll vouch for him.

127
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,686
That's it, please, for once in your life...

128
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,362
trust me.

129
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,612
No, Danny.

130
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,246
It's all our necks on the line and I, for one,
like to know the people I'm working with.

131
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,286
We'll do this another time.

132
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:32,371
-Sorry, man.
-What did I do?

133
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:47,965
Can you please explain the logic to me,
of us going £4 overdrawn...

134
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:51,250
and you charging me £85
to tell me about it?

135
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:55,645
Well, now I'm £89 overdrawn.

136
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:58,963
Thank you. Goodbye.

137
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,605
-Problem?
-Yeah, the man is a moron.

138
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:09,324
-It's a prerequisite for his profession.
-Come on, don't let it get to you.

139
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:12,371
No, Mickey, I want you to go
and beat him up for me.

140
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:16,044
-Are we having a tantrum?
-Yes.

141
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,049
Do you know, he's starting
to make me feel nervous.

142
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,364
Yeah, well, apparently his profits
have gone down since we got back.

143
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:33,683
Everything's about money these days.

144
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,322
Welcome.

145
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,881
Don't mention Mgube.
We'll talk about it later.

146
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,005
Eddie, this is Trevor.

147
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:54,607
Sorry.

148
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:00,211
Oh, sorry, look, one word, all right.

149
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,842
-Principle.
-Principle?

150
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,005
-Yeah, principle, okay.
-Go on.

151
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,162
-I'm an equal partner.
-Yeah.

152
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,688
-I'm entitled to my say.
-Absolutely.

153
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:15,607
-I got an equal voice.
-Same as everyone else.

154
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:20,644
Okay, you lot all knew each other
before I come along, all right.

155
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:24,009
To me, it's like I'm on the outside
looking in.

156
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:27,291
-Oh, Danny.
-Yeah, it's like...

157
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:31,646
the kid with the nose
pressed up against the window.

158
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,531
So this, it's all a matter of principle, yeah?

159
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,569
That's it, Ash, principle. Yeah.

160
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,930
I said I'd vouch for the bloke, didn't I?
I mean, I think my word...

161
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:44,012
should be vouchable.
And if it's not, then....

162
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,482
I guess what I'm saying is,
if it's not, then I'm gonna have to walk.

163
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,726
There you go, I've said it now.

164
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,691
I mean, sometimes a bloke
has to stand up for...

165
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,890
what he stands for.

166
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:10,603
He has a point.
A little trust goes a long way.

167
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:13,730
Yeah, but we don't know him.

168
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,611
Well, we didn't know Danny
when we took him on.

169
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:26,848
Okay.

170
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,482
Danny.

171
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,047
Okay, we're gonna give him a chance
on this one job.

172
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,408
The first time he screws up, he's out.

173
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:45,206
Cheers, thanks, you won't regret it.

174
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,404
I didn't mean what I said
and sorry about burping in your face.

175
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:50,562
Love you all.

176
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,841
-So, how do we get to this Mgube?
-His hobby.

177
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:06,403
He has a world-renowned collection
of rare banknotes.

178
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,723
Yeah, he looks like he's worth a few quid.

179
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,408
Last time, it was estimated at $60 million.

180
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,966
-How many noughts is that, then?
-Lots.

181
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:17,562
And the way in?

182
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,645
He's desperate to add
one new note to his collection.

183
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:24,012
Yankee Green known because--

184
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,208
It's green?

185
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:30,003
Extremely so, yes. It was a new
color process that did not catch on.

186
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:33,165
But that in itself adds to its value.

187
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:38,202
It's a $1,000 treasury note issued in 1866.

188
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,293
The head is of
General George Gordon Meade...

189
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:45,446
Commander of the Union Forces
at the Battle of Gettysburg.

190
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,370
How much is something
like that worth, then?

191
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,569
Only two are known
to still be in existence.

192
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,372
One is owned
by the Chicago Confederate Bank...

193
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:56,765
for which they paid $200,000
nine years ago.

194
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:00,562
And I take it that Mgube has offered
to buy it and been turned down?

195
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,211
Frequently, yes.

196
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,971
So, where do we come in?

197
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:05,891
Now, the second note....

198
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:09,125
Only a handful of people
know its whereabouts.

199
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,045
Fortunately, I'm one of them.

200
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,604
The CEO of the company that insures it
is a friend of mine.

201
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,923
Everyone's a friend of yours, Albie.

202
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:21,090
The owner of the note is Anne Foster.

203
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,287
It is kept in her late husband's collection.

204
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,807
But Mgube doesn't know
anything about her?

205
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,123
He knows the second note belongs
to a private collector...

206
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,283
he just hasn't been able to track it down.

207
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:34,843
Even if he did, she's made it clear
that she will never sell it.

208
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:39,087
Okay, so we got a millionaire who
wants something and we know where it is.

209
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,327
-Now, what?
-Can't we just nick it?

210
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,172
Can we forge the note?

211
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:51,962
Possible. But chances are
Mgube knows the serial number.

212
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:55,006
We'll need to see the real one.

213
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:58,961
-Which means?
-Getting close enough to the original.

214
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:08,842
Mrs. Foster?

215
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:15,446
No, it's nothing serious, Mrs. Foster, we'd
simply like to update our assessment...

216
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:19,890
on some of the more valuable items
that we insure.

217
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:23,928
-My premiums are up to date, you know.
-No.

218
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,052
No, it's more a case of making sure...

219
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,563
that some of the items are
in the same condition as...

220
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,723
when the insurance was taken out.

221
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,972
I'm 83, you know.

222
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:38,330
I don't believe that.
You don't look a day over 75.

223
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,130
Would you like another slice of cake?

224
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,728
Maybe later. Anyway, moving on.

225
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:48,411
Right, jewelry, that should be fine.

226
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:53,323
-I see here you have some banknotes.
-My late husband's.

227
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,888
Right, okay.

228
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,963
Always a danger of damp with those.

229
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,010
They're in a sealed cabinet.

230
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,125
Do you mind if we have a look?

231
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,012
There are a few more things
we need for the Mgube con.

232
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,369
But it seems we're short
of working capital.

233
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,011
And then I thought to myself...

234
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:15,209
who do I know who could
solve a problem like that?

235
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,648
-What do we need?
-I've got a list.

236
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,888
Cor blimey, you don't want much,
do you?

237
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,689
-Leave it with me.
-Okay.

238
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,327
Was everything all right
with your stay, sir?

239
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,042
If you'd just like to sign
at the bottom for me.

240
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,482
Thank you.

241
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,248
The Lexington.

242
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,608
This is Credit Card Authorization.

243
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:23,207
I understand you've got
an authorization problem.

244
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,603
-Well, everything looks fine here.
-It's just showed up on me screen.

245
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,287
-I don't know why that is.
-I tell you what's happened.

246
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,410
-Did you just do a card transaction?
-Yes, a credit card.

247
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,643
You did? Yeah, well,
it may not have gone through.

248
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,724
Do you wanna give me
the card number so I can check it?

249
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:39,885
Sure, the number is 4628....

250
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,130
Yeah, I'd like to make
a credit card purchase, please.

251
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,252
Okay.

252
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:07,926
Tweezers.

253
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:19,288
Yeah.

254
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,291
Is something wrong?

255
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,287
Probably not....

256
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,010
I think we may have
to take some photographs...

257
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,812
just to update our files, if that's okay?

258
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,762
You must do whatever you think best.

259
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,887
Yankee Green.

260
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:53,005
-Can you do it?
-Paper might be difficult.

261
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,891
-What about the seal?
-No, I can do that.

262
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,125
-Who does it have to pass?
-A collector.

263
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,247
-Lab tests?
-No, hopefully not.

264
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,569
-Is it doable?
-Everything's doable, Mr. Stone.

265
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,613
-At a price.
-Right.

266
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,051
Half now, half when it's done.

267
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:26,410
But I've paid money
into the account now, so...

268
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,882
couldn't you just take off the charges?

269
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:33,808
A reason?
Well, how about customer service?

270
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,443
Or just plain, old-fashioned
bloody courtesy?

271
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:42,248
I am not swearing at you,
I'm just trying to point out...

272
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,008
that you're an arrogant little man
with a brain the size of a pea.

273
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,081
Hello? Hello?

274
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,843
-He hung up.
-I can't think why.

275
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,811
Right, this means war.

276
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:03,208
It's £85, my dear.
Isn't war a little overzealous?

277
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:04,692
It's the principle.

278
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:09,652
Principle again. It seems
to be the word of the moment.

279
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,762
-Get your coat, Albie.
-Why?

280
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,004
Because we are gonna get him.

281
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:17,409
-Get him?
-Hopkins.

282
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:21,771
Yep, he knows me but you can be
my secret weapon. Come on.

283
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:33,250
Look, be that as it may, Mrs. Reeves,
we have a very simple system here.

284
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,893
Let me unscramble
the intricacies of it for you.

285
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,851
If you have money in your account,
you can take it out.

286
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,447
-You haven't.
-Come on, kids.

287
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:47,007
Mr. Hopkins? Harrison Wyngate.

288
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:48,367
-Please.
-Thank you.

289
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,011
-Let me.
-Fine.

290
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,883
Okay, next step, Mgube.

291
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,487
We've got a contact in
the limousine company he's using...

292
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:59,963
so we know he's due to visit the banknote
dealers in the Strand this afternoon.

293
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,692
-We can do that, can't we, Trev?
-Yeah.

294
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,846
He did really good today, Mick,
with the old girl.

295
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:11,451
-Have you ever worked on a long con?
-I've read about it.

296
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,567
Yeah, well, I'll make the play,
he'll just back me up.

297
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,166
I'd rather you took Ash.

298
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:21,642
All right, Mick, you're the boss,
it's your call, but....

299
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:27,683
I mean, I wouldn't be sitting here,
would I, if somebody hadn't taught me?

300
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,728
Do not louse this up.

301
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,531
No, we won't.

302
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:47,563
Setting up a transfer is no problem.
Do you have an account here?

303
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,890
No, not yet but the young lady out there
gave me the forms to fill out.

304
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:54,124
Once your application has been processed
we can give you an account number...

305
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,692
so you can arrange the transaction.

306
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,286
Do you know how much
you'll be transferring?

307
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:58,772
3 million, yes.

308
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,930
-Excuse me?
-That's just the first installment.

309
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,362
-First?
-Yes, the company I represent...

310
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,364
has purchased
some land nearby to develop.

311
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:11,082
So we need a holding account, pay
the construction staff, that sort of thing.

312
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:16,008
Well, I'm assuming a branch this size
can deal with that amount of money?

313
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:18,285
Of course.

314
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,207
I've always believed that having
a strong relationship...

315
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:24,205
with the branch you're dealing with
makes life a lot easier.

316
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,893
Head offices can be so tedious.

317
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:28,042
Quite.

318
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,883
Well, it'll be quite a coup for you, I guess.

319
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,168
I'm sure your superiors will be impressed.

320
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,763
Well, rest assured, Mr. Wyngate...

321
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:39,413
the bank and I will be
at your complete disposal.

322
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:40,687
Lovely, brilliant.

323
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,208
Well, now that I've got him,
what shall we do with him?

324
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,692
I'll think of something.

325
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,446
I'm sure you will, my dear,
I'm sure you will.

326
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:59,006
-We're calling on all banknote dealers.
-Customs and Excise?

327
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:02,371
Yeah, this is absolutely nothing
to do with your business.

328
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:05,172
We've checked your accounts.
Everything seems fine.

329
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,923
Just to let you know, we'll be here
as part of our surveillance.

330
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:11,088
Surveillance?

331
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:14,609
Yeah, there's a money laundering gang,
taking money out of the country...

332
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:17,765
by investing in rare coins and banknotes.

333
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,289
So, what do you want me to do?

334
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,841
Oh, nothing. No.

335
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:26,210
Just pretend we're not here
and if anyone asks...

336
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,284
then we're just members of staff.

337
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,729
But I can't possibly have strangers
wandering around the shop.

338
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:37,128
Oh, well, should you decide
not to help with our investigation...

339
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:40,285
we would have to ask ourselves, why?

340
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:47,406
No, of course, please.
I'll help in any way I can.

341
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:51,761
Well, that's super, that really is super,
thank you.

342
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:54,687
Perhaps you could wait in the back office?

343
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:00,367
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of hours.

344
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:13,247
-Hello.
-Danny.

345
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,369
Mgube's car is just pulling up outside.

346
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,522
Okay.

347
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:56,765
Mr. Harris, thank you for calling back, sir.

348
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,887
Yes, I have located
the notes you asked for...

349
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:02,369
and I will fax them over this afternoon.

350
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,447
That's my pleasure, sir.
That is not a problem, sir.

351
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,561
The Yankee Green?

352
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,049
Have located it.

353
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,603
Not managed to get hold of
the owner yet, though.

354
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,924
Absolutely, sir.
I'll let you know as soon as I know.

355
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,569
Goodbye, sir.

356
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:22,532
Excuse me, did I hear you mention
the Yankee Green?

357
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,808
-Sir?
-You spoke about it on the telephone.

358
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:27,965
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't discuss orders from other clients.

359
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,652
Do you know who I am?

360
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,726
I'm here to purchase
a large number of notes.

361
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:38,041
Well, maybe you'd like to have a little look
at our catalogue?

362
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:42,331
No. I would like you
to bring it to my apartment...

363
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,921
in person, in one hour.

364
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:47,083
Not quite sure
I'm gonna be able to do that.

365
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,641
I take it you earn commission
on your sales?

366
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,007
Yes, I do.

367
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:53,766
I intend to spend many thousands.

368
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:59,323
Bring your catalogue in one hour.
Please do not be late.

369
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,041
Where've you been?

370
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,806
-Mickey gave me a shopping list.
-Did you get what you need?

371
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,885
-Yeah, all done.
-Good, I got another job for you.

372
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:23,049
Cor blimey, I've never been so popular.

373
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:25,210
Well, it's more of a personal favor.

374
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:26,722
Go on, then.

375
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,689
Stacie and I would like you to turn these
into proper building plans.

376
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:33,282
What for?

377
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:38,565
Much as I'd love to tell you,
it's more than my life is worth, dear boy.

378
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,244
Right, you know what you're doing, yeah?

379
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,052
Silence is golden.
Egg you on when I need to.

380
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,691
Get the hump when you move
towards the door.

381
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,365
That's it, good luck.

382
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:05,490
All right? How you doing?

383
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:09,123
Mr. Mgube in? Asked us to pop in.

384
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:15,525
-What's going on? Same bloke, ain't it?
-What?

385
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,601
Don't know who....

386
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,763
No.

387
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:30,209
Offer him money as long as
he agrees to sign by tomorrow.

388
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:31,965
If that doesn't work...

389
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:37,009
then tell him I asked
after his wife and children.

390
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:39,002
Good.

391
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:43,968
Hello.

392
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:50,486
I've brought the catalogue for you, sir.
This is my assistant, James.

393
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,645
I am not interested
in your catalogue, young man.

394
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:57,808
I want to talk about the Yankee Green.

395
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:00,084
Did explain that, sir--

396
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:02,687
I will match whatever your other client
is willing to pay.

397
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:03,842
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir--

398
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,288
And give you £20,000 for yourself.

399
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:09,445
I really don't think we should be
having this conversation, sir.

400
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,848
Each.

401
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,527
I'm very sorry.

402
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,932
You did say £20,000, each?

403
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:37,446
At last.

404
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:40,805
Gentlemen in this country
I can do business with.

405
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:44,807
Okay.

406
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:49,248
So, what is your other client's offer?

407
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:51,485
£500,000.

408
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,843
Okay, bring me the note.

409
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,970
If it's genuine, I will pay you in cash.

410
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,882
-This is--
-Wait. You got to be kidding me.

411
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,451
Oh, I can't believe it!

412
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,889
Maybe we should have upped it.
He said ''yes'' too easy.

413
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,406
Do you know how much money that is?

414
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:33,007
Yes, I do, boy.
Come on, we gotta get back, let's go.

415
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,963
This way.

416
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,443
Where did you two sneak off to
earlier today?

417
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:50,084
Albie went to see Hopkins at the bank.

418
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:54,250
-To do what?
-lf he can steal £85 off us...

419
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,972
how much is he taking off people
who can't afford it?

420
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,686
It's extortion.

421
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,486
Maybe, but...

422
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:05,448
isn't sending Albert a bit like
using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut?

423
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,963
He needs to be taught a lesson.

424
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:11,121
Right, I'm sure he does.

425
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,525
Oh, here they are.

426
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:18,486
-Well?
-Am I the bollocks, or what?

427
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,006
Yes!

428
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:24,247
Price?

429
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:26,726
You ready for this?

430
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,967
-You tell them.
-Can I?

431
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,206
Someone bleeding tell us.

432
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:36,402
Half a million.

433
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,008
No.

434
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:45,288
So, what's next?

435
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:48,607
I spoke to Ray about an hour ago,
the note's ready.

436
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,923
You can pick it up at Eddie's
tomorrow morning.

437
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:52,602
Great.

438
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:58,005
Mate, that Stacie bird is a bit of
all right. Is she up for it, or what?

439
00:29:58,093 --> 00:30:00,448
Don't even think about it, Trevor.

440
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,932
-Why not?
-Why not?

441
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,129
Because she's gonna
eat you for breakfast...

442
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:06,602
she's gonna spit out the bones,
it's gonna be very messy.

443
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:09,161
-Tried yourself, have you?
-You could say that.

444
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,252
And?

445
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:15,167
And I had more slaps
than a Morris dancer's ankles.

446
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,843
-Maybe you're not her type.
-What, and you are?

447
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:20,442
Maybe.

448
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,612
Police.

449
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:29,290
-Very funny.
-All right, Ash says you're finished.

450
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:34,327
A flaming...

451
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,567
work...

452
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,928
-of art.
-Pleased to hear it.

453
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:45,971
-It looks really old, doesn't it?
-Yeah, I think that is the general idea.

454
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:51,126
-Well?
-Right. Nice one, Ray.

455
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,730
Don't spend it all at once.

456
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,962
-Looks good.
-Genius.

457
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,211
-You think he'll go for it?
-Only one way to find out.

458
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:29,851
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Mgube. Bye-bye.

459
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:34,287
Okay, I told him I've located the seller.

460
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:37,251
Okay, we fixed the price.
I'm gonna pick up the note tonight.

461
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,212
He's flying to Switzerland tomorrow.
Everything's perfect.

462
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:44,168
Okay, then we're all set.

463
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:50,481
-What do you think?
-It's evil.

464
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:52,769
Disproportionate to the £85...

465
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,447
he and his stupid little bank stole from us?

466
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,524
-Yes.
-Good.

467
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,928
This is the main retail area,
cinema complex, theater district.

468
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,243
It's huge. Has planning been approved?

469
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,006
We're looking at 6,000 jobs.

470
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,163
The council has given us
virtually carte blanche.

471
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:14,768
-I bet they have.
-Construction begins in six weeks.

472
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:17,208
-What's the shaded area here?
-Oh, car parking.

473
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:20,490
That'll cover most of
the current Portway Estate.

474
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:23,007
And this is the only section
that hasn't been acquired.

475
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:27,405
Small but crucial. It will give us
the best access to the car parks.

476
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:30,326
-Who does it belong to?
-I have no idea.

477
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:34,201
Fortunately, it's not our problem.
We've put the car parking out to franchise.

478
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:38,002
But whoever owns it, they're about to be
offered an awful lot of money.

479
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,810
You talking to me?

480
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,891
Neil Marchant, Customs and Excise.

481
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,770
Neil Marchant.

482
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:59,092
Neil Marchant, Customs and Excise.

483
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,763
Yeah, we're doing a bit of surveillance.

484
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:05,562
Half a million.

485
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,844
Half a million.

486
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,648
Hello? Yeah, it is.

487
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,409
I mean, all I'm saying is
you never give me a fair chance.

488
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:38,053
It's all tricks and things I can't work out.

489
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,044
So, you feel the odds are stacked
against you?

490
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:43,603
Exactly, look, I don't mind joining in,
but you've got Danny...

491
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:46,765
with his find-the-lady card thing,
I can never find it.

492
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:49,242
Then you got Ash
with his double-headed coins.

493
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,052
Yeah, double tails,
'cause most people call heads.

494
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:55,603
That's what I'm talking about,
that, all that jiggery-pokery.

495
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:58,969
So, from now on, you pay for your drinks
like normal people...

496
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,283
or at least just give me a fair chance.

497
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,726
-A fair chance?
-Yeah.

498
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:07,806
It's not that you're cleverer than me,
it's just, you cheat.

499
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:12,682
Okay, all right, a fair chance.

500
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:15,562
Okay.

501
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,252
There's £50.

502
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:23,088
Now you take £50 from the till.

503
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:28,091
It's okay, look, there's mine on the bar.
No cheating.

504
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:42,082
-How much is there?
-£100.

505
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,565
Okay. So now we both bid for it
and the highest bid takes it.

506
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:49,162
-We both bid?
-You got it.

507
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:53,611
-Whoever bids most gets it?
-The whole £100. Fair enough for you?

508
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,689
Okay, you go first.

509
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:57,488
Okay.

510
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,371
-£50.
-£60.

511
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:09,445
Okay, you win.
Give me £60 and the £100 is yours.

512
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,963
-I won, right?
-Absolutely.

513
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,332
You'll get us barred.

514
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,843
I cannot help myself.

515
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:42,762
-All right, chaps?
-You're late.

516
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:46,529
Sorry, boss, I had a bit of business
to take care of. We set?

517
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,169
Yeah. Here's the note.

518
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:55,810
Ray says it'll stand up to a visual
but not if they run chemical tests.

519
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:58,691
So the first sign of a test tube,
complain about damaging the note...

520
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:00,729
-and get the hell out of there.
-Got it.

521
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:05,851
This has to be done tonight. Mgube flies
back to Switzerland tomorrow afternoon.

522
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:10,246
Right. Wish us luck.

523
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:13,044
If you're good enough, you won't need it.

524
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:18,371
Hang on, if I gave you £60
and you only put £50 in...

525
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,566
I must be a tenner down.

526
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:25,805
It's all right, I'll toss him for it.

527
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,932
Right, same thing, yeah.

528
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,731
-I do all the talking, right?
-Right.

529
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,850
Like Mickey says, if he gets out
some fancy testing kit...

530
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,572
-we make our excuses and we leave.
-Right.

531
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,611
The most important thing, all right,
is to look a bit nervous...

532
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:41,843
like we know we shouldn't be there.

533
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,728
He knows what we're doing
could cost us our jobs.

534
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,122
Let's make him think
he's doing all the running.

535
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:49,851
-Right.
-You ready?

536
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:52,767
What's wrong?

537
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,524
-Oh, no. It's gone.
-What do you mean, it's gone?

538
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:58,492
I must have left it in the bar.

539
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:01,451
No, you didn't leave it in the bar,
you put it in your pocket.

540
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:04,001
-I must have dropped it.
-No, you didn't drop it, have a look.

541
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:06,323
I don't believe it, I put it in me pocket.

542
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:10,767
I don't believe you.

543
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:14,642
All right, don't panic.

544
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:19,284
Focus. Right, let's retrace our steps.

545
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,524
-Well, look then.
-I don't believe this.

546
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:26,605
Just get looking
and stop with your bloody whining.

547
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,723
Hold on. What?

548
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:35,246
-I put it in my pocket, I swear.
-He's dropped it, ain't he?

549
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:39,846
He's dropped it somewhere between
here and the apartment.

550
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,606
We've retraced our steps,
but someone's picked it up.

551
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,969
Of all the stupid....
Danny, you said you'd vouch for him.

552
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:48,283
Yeah, all right, Mickey,
it could happen to anyone.

553
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:49,931
Only it didn't, did it? It happened to him.

554
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,287
Can we get another one made?

555
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:54,012
No, not in the time.
Mgube's flying back tomorrow.

556
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:55,924
-So we're finished?
-Yeah, afraid so.

557
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:59,725
Do you have any idea
how much money you've just cost us?

558
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:02,407
All right. I've lost out as well, you know.

559
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,165
You didn't put any money in to set this up.

560
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:07,529
Got half a million quid just sitting
there, waiting to be picked up.

561
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:10,122
-Get him out of here.
-Hold on.

562
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,451
Listen, maybe you'd better go.

563
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,888
-This ain't just down to me.
-I said, ''Get him out.''

564
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,929
Hey, just go. Come on.

565
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:19,444
-Just go.
-Out, get out.

566
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,091
All right. I'm leaving.

567
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:22,762
Get out.

568
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:24,968
Losers.

569
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,282
Hey.

570
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:39,163
Okay, just put the cards down flat
for a second. My leg.

571
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,805
Not playing cards with the boys?

572
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:48,531
No, Albert cheats.

573
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:53,606
-Yeah, he does.
-It's funny, isn't it? With old Trevor.

574
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:56,248
-What do you mean?
-Weren't that long ago...

575
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:59,803
-I weren't that much different from him.
-Don't be ridiculous.

576
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:03,966
-You're nothing like him.
-No, short con artist...

577
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:08,889
-scratching a living.
-No way, Danny. He's cheap.

578
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,445
Everything's about the money.

579
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,852
So he misses the beauty of the game.

580
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,571
The beauty?

581
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,964
You know, you're beautiful.

582
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,532
Thank you.

583
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:38,246
-Can I ask you something?
-I suppose so.

584
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,883
You keep knocking me back, yeah.

585
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:50,452
Now, is it because....
No, listen, is it because....

586
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,603
Is it because we work together...

587
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:59,090
-or is it because you don't fancy me?
-What do you think?

588
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:03,086
I used to think it was 'cause we worked
together and then I got thinking...

589
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:04,762
maybe...

590
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,169
I'm just not your type.

591
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:13,603
And what do you think my type is, then?

592
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,087
I don't know.

593
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:20,371
Somebody more like Mickey.

594
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:24,406
Like Mickey or Mickey specifically?

595
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,764
Well, why don't you tell me?

596
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:33,888
-I love you both.
-You love us both?

597
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:37,167
Yeah, but loving us both...

598
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,482
that's just one
of those girly things, isn't it...

599
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,609
when you don't want to shag someone...

600
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:44,729
but you don't want
to hurt their feelings, either...

601
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:49,125
so you pretend you're just good friends
and you don't want to spoil it.

602
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:53,922
So, just so I'm absolutely
crystal clear on this, yeah...

603
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:57,530
a shag is definitely out of the question?

604
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:03,407
-You don't mind me asking, though?
-No, I'm flattered, Danny.

605
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,201
Thanks for our little chat and...

606
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,651
no offense.

607
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,886
None taken.

608
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:43,645
No, listen the deal's still on,
it's just that he's got cold feet, that's all.

609
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:46,566
-You definitely have the note?
-Yeah.

610
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,644
When can I have it?

611
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:51,243
I can have the note to you
by 10:00 tomorrow.

612
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:55,008
-10.:00 is okay.
-And you'll have the money ready?

613
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:57,802
Do not worry, young man.

614
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,289
-Tomorrow at 10:00, then.
-Good.

615
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:01,402
Bye.

616
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:04,642
Muppets.

617
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,481
-Mrs. Foster.
-Yes?

618
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,372
Can I come in?

619
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,212
The thing is, Mrs. Foster...

620
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:27,487
when we studied the photographs
we've discovered...

621
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:30,691
-that the note has been damaged.
-Damaged?

622
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:35,367
Irretrievably, I'm afraid.
Which is why we've decided to pay out.

623
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,408
I don't understand.
Perhaps I should telephone my son.

624
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:41,085
No, there's no need for that.

625
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,846
All I'm here for is to give you
a little bit of money.

626
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:47,084
-What for?
-For the damaged note.

627
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:52,007
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I still don't quite understand.

628
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:54,207
Listen...

629
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:58,327
you remember, we came to do
some photographs, on the note?

630
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,052
Well, the note has been damaged, darling.

631
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,326
The company thought you might
find this all confusing.

632
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,690
£150,000 in cash.

633
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:11,810
It's a sort of down payment
to make you feel a little bit better.

634
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:16,448
I just need you to sign this.

635
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:20,685
-I need my spectacles.
-No, it's all right, it's just one signature.

636
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:23,001
Right there.

637
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:31,971
Of course, I will have to take the note
back with me.

638
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:35,686
I have to call Peter.

639
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:40,608
I don't understand when it comes
to banks, money, and insurances.

640
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:44,490
I really would like to talk to my son.

641
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:47,963
I'm not quite sure
that I understand what you mean.

642
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,603
Well, you've already sold it to me,
haven't you?

643
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,368
Don't you remember?
All legal, money's there.

644
00:44:57,893 --> 00:44:59,724
I'm not selling anything.

645
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:02,247
Blimey, you're getting forgetful,
aren't you, sweetheart?

646
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,166
I'll see myself out.

647
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:08,850
Please, I don't think I want to do this.

648
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:27,611
Mr. Mgube's expecting me.

649
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:37,851
Mr. Mgube.

650
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:40,128
-You have it?
-Yeah.

651
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,330
Do you have the money?

652
00:45:48,493 --> 00:45:52,452
£500,000, as agreed.

653
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:58,926
-And the extra £40,000?
-Your colleague is no longer with you.

654
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,250
Which means I get his share.

655
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:11,682
The note.

656
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:56,892
Pay the man.

657
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:03,166
It's been a real pleasure
doing business with you gents.

658
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:16,925
-Something's going on.
-I reckon...

659
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:19,812
about now.

660
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,442
-Can I help you?
-I'm here to see Mrs. Foster.

661
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:10,206
-Who?
-Mrs. Foster, she lives here.

662
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:12,569
-No, she doesn't.
-So, who the hell are you?

663
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:15,372
I live here, this is my house.

664
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:18,490
-What?
-We've just come back off holiday.

665
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,970
-How'd we do, Betty?
-Or should we call you Mrs. Foster?

666
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,848
£150,000.

667
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:38,209
-You're joking.
-No way.

668
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,602
We only had him down
for £20,000, £25,000 tops.

669
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:42,968
Seems the little shit
was holding out on you.

670
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:47,410
Well, that's what we thought he had
stashed in the caravan, but....

671
00:48:47,493 --> 00:48:50,007
Seems he came into a small windfall.

672
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:57,846
Hello?

673
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:00,402
Yeah, it is.

674
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:11,008
Our favorite bank manager...

675
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:13,653
must have bought his worthless caravan...

676
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:17,043
and even more worthless land for....

677
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:21,488
£150,000 in cash.

678
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:36,123
Yes, I'm trying to find out
who's won the car parking franchise...

679
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,443
for the new development
on the Portway Estate?

680
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,645
What do you mean, ''what development''?

681
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,131
Let me talk to the Planning Officer.

682
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:12,889
Here's the note.

683
00:50:12,973 --> 00:50:15,965
The most important thing, all right,
is to look a bit nervous...

684
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:17,884
like we know we shouldn't be there.

685
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:22,042
He knows what we're doing
could cost us our jobs.

686
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:24,408
Let's make him think
he's doing all the running.

687
00:50:24,493 --> 00:50:26,370
-Right.
-You ready?

688
00:50:27,973 --> 00:50:29,850
What's wrong?

689
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:32,524
-Oh, no. It's gone.
-What do you mean, it's gone?

690
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:36,123
Oh, yeah. All right. Sorry.

691
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:00,529
I can't believe you started without me.

692
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:06,124
Yeah, can I hire a limousine?

693
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:08,930
In the name Mgube.

694
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:10,527
It's traditional.

695
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:13,923
Yes, it's sort of Nigerian...

696
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,412
you know, yeah.

697
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:20,324
Twelve white shirts, 16 collar,
and a dozen assorted ties.

698
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,082
Perks.

699
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:29,128
It's white or white. What do you reckon?

700
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:31,522
-Well, I think....
-Yeah, I thought white myself.

701
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:33,331
-White?
-Yeah.

702
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:39,286
£500,000 as agreed.

703
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,169
Did you hear about
Stacie's little contribution?

704
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:02,006
-Oh, yeah.
-Brilliant, even if I do say so myself.

705
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,888
-Where do you want me, Mick?
-Out front.

706
00:52:14,213 --> 00:52:15,851
I wish I could see his face.

707
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:31,013
-Can I help you, sir?
-What's going on?

708
00:52:31,573 --> 00:52:34,326
-It's been closed down.
-What for?

709
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:35,762
I don't know.

710
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:40,172
CID just dragged a gang out of there.
Con men I reckon.

711
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:45,923
-Do you have any business here, sir?
-No.

712
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,812
Move along, then.

713
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:10,571
-Eddie, you look confused.
-Well, wouldn't you be?

714
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:11,688
Yeah, well, let me explain.

715
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,128
No! Don't tell me,
'cause I don't even wanna know.

716
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:16,808
Wonder where that little weasel's
sleeping tonight.

717
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,532
Yeah, well, at least we let him
keep his van.

718
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,408
Yeah, we did.
We should have had that as well.

719
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:28,042
-He had it coming to him.
-Giving honest con men a bad name.

720
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,125
Where did you find the little creep?

721
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:32,768
Well, he found us, kind of.

722
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,366
I don't get it.

723
00:53:34,453 --> 00:53:37,047
I reckon he's been fleecing
little old ladies his whole life.

724
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:44,524
-Good morning, darling. Mr. Rice?
-That's my husband.

725
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:46,524
Is he in? I've got a parcel for him.

726
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:49,281
-He passed away.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

727
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:54,168
-I can take it.
-It's cash on delivery and it's £85.

728
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:55,608
But what is it?

729
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:58,048
I guess what I'm holding here
was most likely the last thing...

730
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:00,522
your husband ordered
before he passed away.

731
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:04,328
-Listen, don't you worry, I'll take it back.
-No, wait. I'll get my purse.

732
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:05,442
Okay.

733
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,282
But then he made a very big mistake.

734
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:47,683
He picked on the wrong little old lady.

735
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:52,966
Nan!

736
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,161
Hello, darling.

737
00:54:55,253 --> 00:54:56,971
We got him. Yeah, we did.

738
00:54:57,053 --> 00:55:00,204
I tell you what, he's never gonna con you
again and you're our guest of honor.

739
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:02,363
-Oh, I don't get out much.
-Don't you?

740
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:04,284
The taxi driver was very nice.

741
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:06,329
Was he now, you weren't
chatting him up, were you?

742
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:09,007
-Oh, Daniel!
-I know what you old girls are like.

743
00:55:09,413 --> 00:55:12,166
All right, what do you fancy?
A little glass of champagne?

744
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:14,721
Champagne? Oh, I'll be up all night.

745
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:15,928
You will be up all night...

746
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,971
'cause you're gonna be dancing
with your favorite grandson.

747
00:55:19,093 --> 00:55:20,811
Let's have it, come on.

748
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:27,451
Listen, Mickey, can I pay the money
into the bank?

749
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,410
-All of it?
-Yeah.

750
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:33,281
I just want to watch Hopkins
counting his money...

751
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,125
into our account.

752
00:55:35,213 --> 00:55:37,602
There is a very wicked streak in you,
do you know that?

753
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:40,002
Well, there's nothing quite like
getting even.

754
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,412
Nothing at all.

755
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:47,322
Thanks, Stacie.

756
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:53,849
How about a little toast, then?
Here's to Granddad, Nan.

757
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:56,642
Cheers.

758
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,565
-Really, Eddie, you have been fantastic.
-I'm not listening.

759
00:56:10,813 --> 00:56:12,371
-Why?
-'Cause you'll take money off me.

760
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,603
-How can you say that?
-Because you do.

761
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,012
Eddie.

762
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:19,093
All right, I'll listen,
but I'm not opening that till.

763
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:24,088
Well, okay, yeah, fair enough.
Hey, I've gotta show you this.

764
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,610
How long do you think it'll take me
to drink three large brandies?

765
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:29,371
Depends how thirsty you were.

766
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:32,170
-Under a second.
-No way.

767
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,322
Yeah, how much?

768
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:35,967
No, I've told you, there's no way
I'm opening that till.

769
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:37,486
Okay, for fun, then.

770
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:39,526
-Fun?
-Absolutely.

771
00:56:39,893 --> 00:56:42,009
-No money?
-No.

772
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:45,127
-Okay.
-Okay.

773
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:46,202
Set them up.

774
00:56:57,093 --> 00:57:01,530
-Under a second?
-Yep, under a second.

775
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:07,127
-I'll do the timing.
-Yeah, agreed.

776
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:12,809
-Say when.
-Go.

777
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:15,442
Stop! You lose!

778
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:18,647
Yes!

779
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,205
Will you stop doing that, please?

780
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:32,965
Yeah, pay for your drinks
like everyone else.

781
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:36,370
To Eddie.

782
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,728
Cheers, Eddie, thank you!

783
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:32,962
English
