No, not really.

36
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh, good. I bought a bunch of fresh donuts
from my construction workers,

37
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,500
and as you can see, bought a few too many.

38
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:03,700

122
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,400
Seems that he had a relapse last night,

123
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:44,000

148
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,800
What on earth--
- You were blowing on my ear!

149
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:31,100
I was teasing you!
- Exactly!

150
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,000
You have got to get rid of it.
There are children present!

151

hobos!
Whatever, just hurry!

156
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,200
You can't be mad about it!
It's not something men can control!

157
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,800
I kept this friendship going because I thought
Rex's dislike of you was paranoid,

158
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,700
but you had feelings for me all along!

159
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,600
God, this is such a betrayal!

160
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,500
Come on, Bree!

161
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,700
The only thing I am guilty of is
loving you in silence.

162
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, you shouldn't be doing that.
In case you've forgotten, I'm married.

I told you that in confidence.
How dare you throw it back in my face?

165
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:16,700
So-- you're ending our friendship?

166
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:19,000

Nothing. It didn't mean anything.

169
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:30,000
George, I do love you-- as a friend.

170
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:35,000
I wish you could love me the same way back,
but since you can't--

00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,400
She said she might be a little late.

176
00:10:57,435 --> 00:11:00,700
They've already started moving a few of
Mike's things over to her house.

177
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,500
Already? Wow! Good for her.

178
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:07,300
Yeah, it's nice to see Susan so happy again.

179
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,817
Yeah, I'm happy for Susan.

180
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:13,800
But don't you think
she and Mike are moving a little fast?

181
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:17,200
Two days ago, she was thinking he was a murderer,
and now she's moving in with him?

182
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:20,000
Hnn.
- She found that was in self-defense.

183
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,400
I think they've cleared everything up.
- Yeah, good point.

184
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:24,200
Mike's a decent guy.

185
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:29,200
Yeah, that's true. Of course, though--
with the gunshot wound--

186
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,700
That's right. Did he ever explain that?

187
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:36,000
No. And I know guns,
and that wound was not self-inflicted.

188
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:36,682
Mmm.

189
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:41,300
And then, what about 
Mrs Huber's blood-stained jewelry?

190
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:45,300
Yeah, that didn't walk into 
Mike's garage by itself.

191
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,512
Maybe this is a mistake.

192
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:50,900
There's one thing I've learned:
Men can't be trusted.

193
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:52,022
Hold it.

194
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:56,100
Are you saying that we should put a stop to this?

195
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,900
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to
sit her down and share our concerns.

196
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,381
Yeah, we could do that.

197
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,700
Tyah--

198
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,400
Edie, do you want to be a part of it?

199
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:12,400
Well, normally I prefer not to get involved.

200
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,638
But--

201
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:20,374
if there's any way that I can help Susan...

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,677
We need to talk.

203
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,246
OK.

204
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:34,600
When I was packing up your stuff
in your bedroom, I found a box of bullets.

205
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,863
Oh.

206
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:42,300
Look, I feel really bad about Deirdre, and 
I know you must want to find out who killed her.

207
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,700
But if we're moving in together,
we can't have this stuff hanging over us.

208
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,900
You've got to get rid of it. 
All of it.

209
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,500
The file, the map, the gun... 
Especially the gun.

210
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:56,500
And leave this to the police.
They're the professionals.

211
00:12:56,535 --> 00:13:00,600
What can I say?

212
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,523
Seems like a reasonable request.

213
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:09,400
Oh. Really?
That was easy.

214
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Maybe after lunch we could talk about
your leather bean bag chair.

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,800
"I realize now that I've treated you badly.

216
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:40,400
"I'm the one who needs to get help, not you.

217
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:44,400
"So I have to go away for a while.
In the meantime, Mrs Tilman will look out for you.

218
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:48,300
I don't consider it a burden.
You know you're welcome here.

219
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:52,200
"I left you some things.
I hope you can take comfort in them.

220
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:57,100
"I got you a new mitt.
Work on your curveball while I'm gone.

221
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,200
"I love you. Dad."
I don't understand!

222
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:02,700
Why wouldn't he come see me?
Why just run away?

223
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:07,700
Your father's been very troubled, dear.
I'm sure he did what he felt was best for you.

224
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,900
And he wants me to take comfort in this junk?

225
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,300
I hate baseball!
You'd think he would know that!

226
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,233
Zach--

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,900
Susan's coming!
- OK.

228
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,300
OK, guys. 
Interventions are never pretty.

229
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:12,300
So stay strong,
'cause she's probably going to cry.

230
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,217
Bon jour!

231
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:29,100
Oh, hi! I didn't know the cooking lesson
would be a group activity.

232
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Well, the more the merrier, right?
As long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crêpes.

233
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,465
How come I'm the only one wearing an apron?

234
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:44,300
I know it seems like
we're ganging up on you, but--

235
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:49,300
You were moving so fast, we thought 
a sort of-- intervention was necessary.

236
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,371
I know it's tough to hear.
And none of us wanted to do this.

237
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,900
I appreciate what you guys are trying to do.
I really do. Um--

238
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,127
I'm not going to change my mind.

239
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,460
In my life, I've been hurt a lot.

240
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,397
Karl, and, uh--

241
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:25,900
Well, it just taught me to be cynical
and expect the absolute worst from people.

242
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,600
And I don't want to live like that anymore.

243
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,600
And when Mike asked me to move in with him,

244
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:36,601
I was just happy.

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Just ridiculously happy.
I still am.

246
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:46,400
I want to go with that feeling.
I'd love him, and I'd love him!

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I'll expect the best from Mike,
and I know he'll deliver that in return.

248
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,293
OK?

249
00:16:56,335 --> 00:17:01,300
- Honey!   - OK!   
- That was so good--

250
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
This is the worst intervention 
I've ever been to.

251
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,400
This is fun!
It's forever since we had lunch.

252
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:22,400
Well, as happy as I am to see you,
I actually have an agenda.

253
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,600
I ran into someone last week who said
you guys were looking to hire. Is that true?

254
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah. Are you thinking of coming back?

255
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,100
Because, say the word, then I--

256
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,400
No, not me.
I was actually thinking more about Tom.

257
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,313
Oh! Tom.

258
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,900
Yeah, he's been thinking about 
making a move for a while.

259
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:45,900
He kind of feels like he's done 
everything he can where he is now.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Well, Tom's certainly-- solid.

261
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:55,200
He's more than solid.
Tom's ideas are spectacular.

262
00:17:55,235 --> 00:18:00,000
He's passionate about his work.
His visual instincts are off the chart.

263
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,000
Is he as good as you?

264
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:07,000
He's-- apples, I'm oranges.
We excel in different areas.

265
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
Trust me, you should give Tom a look.

266
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:14,800
I don't need apples.
I need someone like you.

267
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:17,300
Cut-throat. Ruthless.

268
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:22,300
Jeez, Nat!
You make me sound like some kind of shark.

269
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,048
Ah! OK!

270
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:33,000
You know, actually, if that's 
the kind of exec you're looking for--

271
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,200
You got a shark for me?

272
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:40,200
Yes. A very pretty shark.

273
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,700
So, here's what I'm thinking.

274
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:50,600
I'll see if Dr Morrisson at the Lipstone Clinic
can come in and consult.

275
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:53,000
You want to bring someone else in?

276
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:56,800
Your body isn't responding 
to the medication the way it should.

277
00:19:56,835 --> 00:20:01,600
And the tests we've run
have all come back negative, so I--

278
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,479
I just want to be on the safe side.

279
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,267
Excuse me. I need to take this.

280
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,500
I don't know why, but I have this
overwhelming feeling that you'll be fine.

281
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:25,033
I really do.

282
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:29,000
Lee Craig has the biggest ego 
of any doctor I know.

283
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:34,000
If he wants to consult with someone,
that means he's stomped.

284
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
Which means I'm screwed.

285
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,500
Don't say that.
- Damn it, Bree!

286
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,200
Do you understand what's going on here?

287
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:41,782
I could die!

288
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,035
So could I.

289
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,488
What?

290
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:55,600
I could walk across the street tomorrow
and be hit by a car.

291
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,733
What in God's name is your point?

292
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:07,100
All I'm saying is that
we're both going to die eventually.

293
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,600
And that the time we have left,
whether it's two days or two decades,

294
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:16,600
I think that we should 
be nice to each other.

295
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,664
You're right.

296
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Um, Ms Tilman--

297
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:32,300
Paul Young's been missing the last 
couple of days. Have you seen him?

298
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,426
Why ask me?

299
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:39,400
I saw him leave a box on your doorstep,
and I've also seen Zach over here.

300
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:44,400
If I did know where Mr Young was,
why would I tell you?

301
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,717
Look, um--

302
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,500
The police think I killed your sister,
and I'm sure you do, too.

303
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,800
But I swear to you,
I had nothing to do with it.

304
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:53,479
And you think Paul Young did?

305
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:57,500
Well-- no, that's not what I'm saying.

306
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:01,600
You've got to admit, it's a neat theory.

307
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,354
Care for a snack?

308
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
...and so, it's not such a stretch.

309
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:13,500
I wonder if Paul avenged his wife's death
by killing Martha for blackmailing them.

310
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,100
But perhaps I'm alone in there.

311
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,800
You're not.

312
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,900
Aren't you sweet.

313
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:25,300
Tea?
- Thanks.

314
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:30,300
Do these journals say anything about why
your sister was blackmailing the Youngs?

315
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Not specifically. But I'd gotten a 
definite impression that it involved a murder,

316
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,900
and now here you are saying
your friend was murdered...

317
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Any reason you haven't 
shown these to the police?

318
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,731
Are you in favor of the death penalty?

319
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:56,592
Um-- yeah.

320
00:22:57,035 --> 00:23:02,872
So am I. We had it in Utah.
Not in this state though.

321
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
A shame. Don't you agree?

322
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,667
Yeah, I do.

323
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,613
I like you so much, Mr Delfino.

324
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,000
You know where Paul Young is?

325
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:28,484
I'm afraid not.

326
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:35,184
But I know where he'll be on Thursday night.

327
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,100
<i>That afternoon, while retrieving her mail,

328
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:51,100
<i>Gabrielle was surprised to finally
learn the truth behind her pregnancy.

329
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,571
<i>Very surprised.

330
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,437
Hey babe.
Wanna go online and check out schools?

331
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,948
What's going on?

332
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:11,400
I just want to say goodbye,
because I'm leaving you.

333
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,677
What?

334
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:19,400
Your health insurance sent us a letter because someone 
ordered a year's worth of my birth control pills.

335
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,400
And apparently our policy doesn't cover
drugs bought by the kilo.

336
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:25,100
I told you it was Mamá!

337
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,800
The prescription was dated, Carlos.

338
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:29,800
And Juanita was in a coma
when this claim was filed!

339
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,954
You did this, not your mother!

340
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:35,503
At least be man enough to own up to it.
She would have been.

341
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Stop!
- Uh-uh! I'm pregnant, Caveman, remember?

342
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,300
Where are you going?

343
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,873
Away!

344
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to jail!
I'll be gone tomorrow!

345
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,397
I know.
That's why I only packed one bag.

346
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:02,100
What about the baby, Gabrielle? Huh?
What about my baby?

347
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,100
Oh, your baby?

348
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,000
Fine, <i>our</i> baby!

349
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,000
Hey, we're a family now!

350
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:09,600
This baby needs its mother 
<i>and</i> its father!

351
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh Carlos.
Whoever said you were the father?

352
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,176
Hey!

353
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,257
Hey.

354
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:45,700
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:48,119
Damn felon!

356
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,900
All units, code D-16-30.
Suspect is in violation of house arrest.

357
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:07,700
Currently heading west on Parker Blvd.

358
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,700
This is unit 14, we're on our way.

359
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:15,700
They say the Feds have a runner.
- Let's go.

360
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,838
Is John here?

361
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,900
If I say no, 
are you going to slap me again?

362
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:36,800
He's working. Why?

363
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:39,868
I just left my husband.

364
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,039
Hang on!

365
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,800
You think just because you mow my lawn
you could bang my wife?

366
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,889
Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!

367
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,100
Hey.
What's going on?

368
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,800
Oh Tom, I have had the craziest day.

369
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:04,400
This morning, the guy of
Spermetual Incurrence called me, and--

370
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,900
they offer me a job!

371
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,600
Are you going to take it?

372
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:11,800
I told Peterson about it.
He just upped their offer!

373
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:15,600
He just made me vice president!

374
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:16,900
O--of what?

375
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:19,500
Tom! The firm!

376
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:23,200
He gave me Duggan's old job! 
Isn't that wild?

377
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:28,200
I gotta go tell Scottie. I'll see you later!

378
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Oh Tom, I was just coming to find you.

379
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:37,800
What the hell, Dan?

380
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,200
I mean, what the hell?!

381
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:42,059
You promoted Annabelle over me?

382
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:45,600
She got a little job offer.
I couldn't afford to lose her. Not now.

383
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,379
Well guess what, you lose me!

384
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,000
'Cause I quit!

385
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:49,900
Tom, don't overreact.

386
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:53,600
No. The first time you passed me by,
I took it like a good soldier.

387
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:57,000
But since Duggan's heart attack,
I have already been doing the job!

388
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,800
I have been doing it!
And then you just hand it to Annabelle?

389
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:02,300
OK. You made your point.

390
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,746
Wha--?

391
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,300
You make crappy decisions on a daily basis,
Dan, I gotta tell you.

392
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:09,600
But this one, this is the stupidest.

393
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,100
Hey, watch yourself.

394
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:14,300
You have been running this company
into the ground since you got here.

395
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,375
The way I see it, I'm getting out easy.

396
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,000
All right, Scavo. You want to know
why I gave that promotion to Annabelle?

397
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:23,143
Why she got the nod instead of you?

398
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,017
It was Lynette.

399
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,301
What?

400
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:31,200
She went to my wife and begged her
to get me to kill your promotion.

401
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:35,083
She said that if you start travelling more,
it'll hurt your family.

402
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,758
She did that?

403
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:40,100
Now I feel like a chum 
for trying to help you guys out.

404
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,900
I guess that was another one 
of my "crappy decisions".

405
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:45,510
Have your desk cleaned up by tonight.

406
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,897
You wouldn't tell us
what you got against this kid?

407
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,772
It's between him and me.
And my wife.

408
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,168
Is that what this is about?

409
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:00,900
You doin' his wife?

410
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:05,900
No. I'm gay.

411
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
You're gay?
- What?

412
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm gay.

413
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:12,500
Ahh, this is not happening again...

414
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,429
What do you mean, again?

415
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:19,709
I want a lawyer.

416
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,500
George!

417
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,362
Hi! What are you doing here?

418
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,541
I'm shopping, obviously.

419
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:41,600
Why are you shopping here?
You live on the other side of town.

420
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:45,500
My friend had an operation,
I'm buying her some things.

421
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh.
Well, that's very nice of you.

422
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:53,694
Wait, Bree.
I have to tell you something.

423
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,667
Well?

424
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:04,778
You need to tell Rex to be more discreet
when it comes to discussing your love life.

425
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm sorry?

426
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:11,900
I don't want to say anything more.
You just really need to tell him that.

427
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,300
Wait a minute!
What in the world are you talking about?

428
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,800
I was at the hospital,
to see my friend who had had this operation,

429
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:26,800
and I overheard two doctors
talking about Rex's fondness for--

430
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,700
S&M.

431
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,776
You heard that?

432
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:43,000
Apparently, he told them he has a--
box of toys,

433
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:48,000
and he-- gets you to do--
very inappropriate things.

434
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,886
I see.

435
00:31:53,335 --> 00:31:55,300
Bree, this is clearly none of my business,

436
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:57,000
and I would have never brought this up,

437
00:31:57,035 --> 00:32:02,000
but hear these two men laughing about you...
I just thought you should know.

438
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,047
Thank you for telling me, 
but I think I'm--

439
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,916
I gotta go.

440
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,410
Hey, got some more boxes.

441
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,431
That's your answer to everything these days.

442
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,600
So what do you think 
we should do for dinner?

443
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:43,600
Oh, I--I can't.
I just got an emergency phone call.

444
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,400
A busted water main.
- OK.

445
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:47,769
I'll keep it warm for you.

446
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,200
You know, I'm-- afraid 
I'll be too late for dinner.

447
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,923
I wasn't talking about dinner.

448
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,900
Need some help?
- Uh, no.

449
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,764
No, I got it.

450
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:18,600
So if you have a plumbing emergency,
shouldn't you get going?

451
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:21,300
Um, they've already got somebody on it.
I'm just part of the relief crew.

452
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:26,300
Oh.
Well, I'll just get back to work.

453
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,400
Mom-- stalking?

454
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:35,700
Are you really doing this?

455
00:33:35,735 --> 00:33:38,800
You just made such a huge deal to your friends
about how much you trust him now.

456
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:42,918
That was before I found
Mrs Huber's journal in his truck.

457
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,749
So-- what's in it?

458
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:49,800
It's not about what's in it.
It's about the fact that he had it at all.

459
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:54,800
I would bet you anything he's not going
on a plumbing job, and we're going to find out.

460
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,758
Mom--

461
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:03,923
If you don't trust him,
why are you moving in with him?

462
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,744
I don't have time to explain
adult relationships to you.

463
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:10,044
Duck down!

464
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,600
I think you lost him.
- He's six cars up.

465
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:20,100
We have to stay this far back,
or he'll see us.

466
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,097
OK, great, but we can't see him either.

467
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,300
I gotta tell you, Mom,
you're not great at this.

468
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:25,400
Oh yeah?

469
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,900
When your father was cheating on me,
I used to follow him all the time.

470
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,371
I know my stuff.

471
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,747
Here he is.

472
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,000
What's Mike doing?
Who's that he's pulling up to?

473
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,700
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out.

474
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,900
What are you--?

475
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:48,900
Unlock the doors.

476
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,500
All right, what the hell are you up to?

477
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh my God.

478
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,501
Wow.

479
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:03,002
Um--

480
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,100
OK. 

481
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:05,801
Oh! 

482
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:06,602
Wow. 

483
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:07,603
Uh--

484
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:08,331
Goodbye!

485
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:13,400
Was that your wife?

486
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:15,269
If that was my wife,
do you think I'd be here with you?

487
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,476
It wasn't Mike, was it?

488
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:29,317
No. No, it wasn't.

489
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:35,100
They're charging you with a hate crime?

490
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,618
You remember when 
our cable guy was beaten up?

491
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:41,260
That was me.

492
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,659
I thought you were cheating with him!

493
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,400
With our gay cable guy?

494
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:53,098
I didn't know he was gay!
I didn't know Justin was either!

495
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,313
Now the cops think 
I'm some kind of serial gaybasher.

496
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,600
Well, you sort of are.

497
00:35:58,635 --> 00:36:00,511
You provoked me!

498
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,579
You were pretending to have an affair
just to punish me!

499
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:12,619
Well, obviously!

500
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,841
So now I need you to lie again.

501
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,000
I need you to tell the cops
you <i>were</i> having an affair,

502
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:25,700
and that I just beat up the wrong guy.

503
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:27,148
Guys.

504
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,800
I am not lying for you, Carlos.

505
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:35,800
Gabby, if this charge sticks,
I get sent away for eight years.

506
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
Am I supposed to be impressed?

507
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:43,000
Because of your little stunt with my birth control pills,
I've lost my freedom for the next <i>eighteen</i> years!

508
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,078
Gabby, please don't do this.

509
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,300
Gabby!

510
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,443
Don't walk away!

511
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:55,706
Gabby!

512
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,700
OK, next time I won't bring my daughter 
to stalk my boyfriend.

513
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,062
It was a slight error in judgement.

514
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:08,791
Honey, please don't give me 
the silent treatment.

515
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm not.

516
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,931
Did you say you read this?

517
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,186
Yeah, part of it. Why?

518
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:24,293
Mrs Huber was blackmailing Zach's mom.

519
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,300
Zach?

520
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,949
What are you doing up?

521
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:19,400
Couldn't sleep, so I was just--
sitting here. Thinking.

522
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,486
About what?

523
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:29,165
Do you really want to know?

524
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:31,209
Bree--

525
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:36,300
I'm not feeling too hot right now.
So just tell me. What's up?

526
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I was thinking that the biggest mistake 
of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.

527
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,541
Let me guess.
I've done something wrong.

528
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,500
Forcing me into sharing
your depraved pastime wasn't bad enough?

529
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,800
You had to share my humiliation
with your co-workers?

530
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:01,900
What?

531
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:05,600
Rex, everybody is talking about our sex life.

532
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:10,300
Every sordid little detail, right down to
that box of perversions you keep in the closet!

533
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:13,400
Bree, I never said anything to anyone,
I swear to God!

534
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,100
You're a liar.

535
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:15,700
Who told you this?

536
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:16,400
Doesn't matter.

537
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:18,400
It does matter, because I never said anything!

538
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:21,600
Then how do people know?
Because we both know that I wouldn't say anything!

539
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:23,800
Why would I tell people about what we do in bed?

540
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:26,100
[---] Maybe you were bragging.

541
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:29,200
Or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me.

542
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:32,500
Congratulations, you did it!
I am officially destroyed!

543
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:36,864
I didn't say anything!
- I don't believe you.

544
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,007
Oh.

545
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Oh.

546
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Rex?

547
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:50,200
What? What is it?

548
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:52,487
I think I'm having a heart attack.

549
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,657
No, you're not.

550
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:01,973
Bree, you're going to have to
take me to the hospital.

551
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,986
Um--

552
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:11,100
All right, you-- go downstairs and, um,

553
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:15,365
I will be--
I'll be right there.

554
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,188
Daddy?

555
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:36,000
What are you doing?

556
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm waiting for your mother
to take me to the Emergency Room.

557
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:44,100
What's wrong?
- I'm having a heart attack.

558
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:46,512
Oh my God, where is she?

559
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:47,962
That's a good question.

560
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:53,382
Daddy says he's having a heart attack.

561
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:57,800
I know. I'm going to 
take him to the hospital.

562
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:58,801
Well, when?

563
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:04,179
When I finish making the bed.

564
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:06,185
What?

565
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:10,500
I never leave the house with an unmade bed.
You know that.

566
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,402
But Daddy needs to go the hospital.

567
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,283
There. 
Now we can go.

568
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,100
<i>Nothing is forever.

569
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:38,100
<i>And the time comes when we all
must say goodbye to the world we know.

570
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,800
<i>Goodbye to everything
we had taken for granted.

571
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,900
<i>Goodbye to those
we thought would never abandon us.

572
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,600
<i>And when these changes finally do occur,

573
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
<i>when the familiar has departed
and the unfamiliar has taken its place,

574
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>all any of us can really do

575
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,900
<i>is to say hello

576
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:25,900
<i>and welcome.
