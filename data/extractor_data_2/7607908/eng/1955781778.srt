1
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:05,848
I thought you didn't like
taking the Lord's name in vain?

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,387
Oh, shut up.

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,034
It's been a while, huh?

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:12,168
Don't blame me.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,981
You're the one who had a heart attack.

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:17,373
Mm, the doctor did say I
needed to get more exercise.

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,457
I think he meant walks around the block.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,077
No, he winked at me,

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,413
and did this little rotation
with his hips, like...

10
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:27,483
Mm.

11
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,618
Hmm.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,820
Hey, we got any plans this weekend?

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,918
I thought maybe we could get
started on the vegetable garden,

14
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,997
and then, of course, church on Sunday.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,754
Yeah, that does sound fun,

16
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:41,130
but what if, instead, I
was to go up to Bethy Creek

17
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,965
with Georgie and do some fishing?

18
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,368
How long you been waiting
to spring that on me?

19
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,523
Well, not till I was
done rotating my hips.

20
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:49,338
You're awful.

21
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,312
So what do you say?

22
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:56,412
What about Sheldon?

23
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,314
What about him?

24
00:00:58,316 --> 00:00:59,382
George.

25
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:01,171
You can't always leave him out.

26
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,718
I'm not leaving him out.

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,387
You know how he is about fishing.

28
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:06,171
Get it away, get it away!

29
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,857
Calm down, it's an itty-bitty thing.

30
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,093
No, I'm an itty-bitty thing!

31
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,395
Who says you have to take him fishing?

32
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,930
Find something else to do with him.

33
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:15,131
Something he'd like.

34
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,466
What are we gonna do? Spend the weekend

35
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:17,967
sitting around, thinking?

36
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,035
George.

37
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,544
You have to make an effort.

38
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,614
Young boys who don't spend
time with their daddies

39
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:24,390
grow up to be oddballs.

40
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:27,710
Honey, I hate to tell you, but
that ball is already pretty odd.

41
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,187
Please.

42
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:35,485
Okay, fine.

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,793
I'll talk to him. We'll
think of something.

44
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:39,722
Good.

45
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,091
Thank you.

46
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,496
What?

47
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,865
I was just remembering
when I took him camping.

48
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,133
Moth! Moth!

49
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,868
Sheldon, it's just a butterfly.

50
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,169
How is that any better?

51
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,204
Butterfly, butterfly!

52
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:14,671

53
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,665
Hey, pal.

54
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,400
Playing with your rockets?

55
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:27,203
I'm trying to calculate
ballistic coefficients.

56
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,805
Well, that's fun, too.

57
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:31,641
Listen, I don't have
to work this weekend,

58
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:33,843
I was wondering if you wanted
to do something together.

59
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,111
Like what?

60
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,946
Whatever you want.

61
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,615
Well, the filter on my air
purifier needs to be changed.

62
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,176
How about a trip to Sears?

63
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,519
Yeah, I was thinking along
the lines of something

64
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:44,687
a little more active.

65
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,022
Like last year,

66
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,123
we went fishing...

67
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,224
Mom! Dad's trying

68
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:49,593
to make me go fishing!

69
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,289
No, no, it's okay.

70
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,529
We're not going fishing.

71
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:55,865
All right, good.

72
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,033
But seriously,

73
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,434
was fishing really that bad?

74
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,336
Mom! Dad's trying to convince me

75
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:02,038
that fishing wasn't that bad!

76
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,306
Shh. Come on!

77
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,028
Forget I said anything about fishing.

78
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,020
Just think about it,

79
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:08,778
and we'll do whatever you want.

80
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,273
Thank you.

81
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,152
There is the launching of the
space shuttle this weekend.

82
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,620
Space shuttle?

83
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,388
Don't they do those out of Florida?

84
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,140
Yes. Cape Canaveral.

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,062
Sheldon, that's-that's
like a 12, 15 hour drive.

86
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,820
I understand. Never mind.

87
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,535
You know what? Let's do it.

88
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,136
It'll be fun.

89
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,539
The three Cooper boys
on a little adventure.

90
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,707
Sound good?

91
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,625
Sounds good.

92
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:44,614
My plan was coming together.

93
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,816
I just needed to get on the shuttle

94
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:50,620
so I could finally escape
this ridiculous planet.

95
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:54,156
Spoiler alert, I'm still here.

96
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:55,709
So, Sheldon, me and Georgie

97
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,645
are gonna take a little
road trip this weekend,

98
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:58,761
see the shuttle launch.

99
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,590
Looks like I don't get a vote in this.

100
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:02,265
Oh, good, you're catching on.

101
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,667
I wonder if we'll get
to meet an astronaut.

102
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,202
I remember when I was a teenager,

103
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,305
I had the biggest crush on John Glenn.

104
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,543
I would've given it
up for him no problem.

105
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:13,376
- Mom.
- Given what up?

106
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,211
Her allowance. Just eat.

107
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,846
So how long are you gonna be gone?

108
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,615
Oh, we'll leave first
thing Saturday morning,

109
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:19,817
stay the night in a motel,

110
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,018
and see the launch bright
and early on Sunday.

111
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,486
I can't believe we're going to see

112
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,621
an actual working spacecraft.

113
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,520
Look how happy he is.

114
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:28,457
Good job.

115
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:29,825
How come I don't get to go?

116
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:32,676
'Cause you, me and Meemaw
are gonna have our own fun.

117
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,773
Could we shoot guns at the gun range?

118
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,899
Mm, you're too young
to go to the gun range.

119
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,367
Meemaw took me.

120
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:40,269
We pinky swore. What are you doing?

121
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,504
Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:42,754
Don't listen to me.

123
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,539
I don't know what I'm saying.

124
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,320
I know you like to just keep driving,

125
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,356
and get where you're
going, but you can't ignore

126
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,140
- his bathroom schedule.
- I know.

127
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:57,252
He goes number one first
thing in the morning,

128
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,590
then again in the afternoon,
once more in the late afternoon,

129
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,272
say 4:00, 4:30, depending
on his juice intake,

130
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,309
and then, a quick piddle before bedtime.

131
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,773
- "Piddle." Got it.
- Now,

132
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:09,031
number two's a little trickier.

133
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,066
Mary? Relax.

134
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,367
I can take care of my son.

135
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,820
I know.

136
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:13,853
Good.

137
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:14,804
I'm just saying,

138
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:16,426
if he's upset or nervous,

139
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,890
he can get all clogged up.

140
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,275
I won't let that happen.

141
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,743
Thank you.

142
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:22,425
Okay, let's talk about food.

143
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:23,661
No need to.

144
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:27,373
He likes his meat cooked
to at least 165 degrees,

145
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,176
except for chicken, which is 180.

146
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,515
The different foods can't
touch each other on the plate.

147
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,652
Ketchup and mustard must
come out of a packet.

148
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,021
No bottles.

149
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,961
What about his issues with spaghetti?

150
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,004
That's a trick question.

151
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,665
He likes spaghetti.

152
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,203
All right, I guess you got this.

153
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,645
Georgie.

154
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,242
Up and at 'em.

155
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,492
Missy, where's your brother?

156
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,242
Who cares?

157
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,832
- Sheldon, you in there?
- Dad!

158
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,934
Sorry, Georgie.

159
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,236
What's going on?

160
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,471
I can't find Sheldon.

161
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:24,507
What do you mean, you can't find him?

162
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,442
I mean I don't know where he is.

163
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,567
Well, he's got to be somewhere.

164
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,914
Maybe he got that time machine to work.

165
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,536
Where the hell...

166
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:35,937
George.

167
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,281
I think he's ready to go.

168
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,728
Wait, Georgie.

169
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,730
- Where's your bag?
- Don't need one.

170
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,031
Got my toothbrush right here.

171
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,366
What about clothes?

172
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,834
A change of underwear?

173
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,135
Got it.

174
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:55,582
Georgie, you're gonna
be gone for two days.

175
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,173
I'll turn them inside out.

176
00:06:58,023 --> 00:06:59,456
- Shotgun!
- No, no.

177
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,342
Let your brother sit
up front for a change.

178
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,878
I actually prefer sitting in the back.

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,979
It's safer.

180
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,382
Oh, come on, sit up
front with your daddy.

181
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,350
He doesn't get to spend
enough time with you.

182
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,919
I called shotgun.

183
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,187
George.

184
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,556
We'll flip a coin.

185
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,624
All right? Georgie, call it.

186
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,092
Heads.

187
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:19,361
Tails.

188
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,887
Dang it. Sheldon, you won.

189
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,097
You get to ride up front.

190
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,599
Can't we do two out of three?

191
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,801
You won. Get in the car.

192
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,970
What's the point in calling shotgun?

193
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:29,538
You're a good dad.

194
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,107
If I don't kill one of them
before Sunday, I'm a good dad.

195
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,110
Have fun.

196
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:37,546
Love you guys.

197
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:40,349
Bye! Drive safe!

198
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:49,992
Oh, this was a good idea,
this was a good idea,

199
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,876
this was a good idea.

200
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,389
This was a good idea.

201
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,332
Isn't this exciting?

202
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,363
It's just us girls,
no boys in the house.

203
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,016
The place already smells better.

204
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,122
So what are we gonna do?

205
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:07,360
How would you like

206
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:10,260
to go to the beauty
salon and get all done up?

207
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,495
Can I have orange
hair like Cyndi Lauper?

208
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,464
I don't think so.

209
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,733
Meemaw has friends with blue hair.

210
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:18,735
She's right.

211
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:19,903
I haven't gone there yet,

212
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,579
but after a certain age, it's mandatory.

213
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,308
Your hair's not changing color.

214
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,177
- Aw.
- Sorry, kiddo.

215
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:29,713
Your mom is no fun.

216
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,644
Excuse me, I'm fun.

217
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:32,916
So I can color my hair?

218
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,150
Not a chance.

219
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,719
But I'm very much fun.

220
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,455
Whatever you need to believe.

221
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:40,254
Mein Fuhrer.

222
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,268
Dad?

223
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,403
Yeah?

224
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:55,438
Would you like to have a conversation?

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah.

226
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:58,141
Sure. Absolutely.

227
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:00,610
All right, what would
you like to talk about?

228
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:03,938
Um, well, let's see.

229
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:06,783
Uh... have you given much
thought to what you want to be

230
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:07,985
when you grow up?

231
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,020
I have.

232
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:11,433
Great.

233
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,277
And what would that be?

234
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,907
Oh. Most likely a scientist.

235
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,400
Unless I stay in Texas, then
I'm thinking cattle baron.

236
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,668
Cattle baron?

237
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,870
Assuming I don't have to touch the cows.

238
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,005
Goes without saying.

239
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,743
Did you always want
to be a football coach?

240
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,443
Well, I always wanted to play.

241
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:34,944
At least till I got hurt.

242
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,846
Mm.

243
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:38,314
Were you a good player?

244
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,550
Eh, not really.

245
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,419
I was just bigger than the other kids.

246
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,854
So you compensated for mediocrity

247
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,524
by being large.

248
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:49,559
I guess.

249
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,161
That works for cattle as well.

250
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:53,029
Oh, well, thanks for pointing that out.

251
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,230
You're welcome.

252
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,334
You might want to open a window.

253
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,730
Oh, boy.

254
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,407
Oh...

255
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:11,181
My head is so hot.

256
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,855
She is such a hoot.

257
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,287
- You okay?
- Fine.

258
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,590
Okay, don't tell me.

259
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:23,626
So hot...

260
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,128
I don't like you making me out

261
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,663
to be the bad guy just 'cause I won't

262
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,531
let my daughter do whatever she wants.

263
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,666
I gave you a lot of freedom,

264
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:31,101
you turned out okay.

265
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,635
You didn't give me freedom.

266
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,243
You were never around.

267
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,772
Is that so?

268
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:38,508
I guarantee I made supper
for Charlene and Edward

269
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,843
more times than you ever did.

270
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:41,344
I basically raised 'em.

271
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,812
You think I was out dancing?

272
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,748
I was out working two
jobs so your daddy could

273
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,217
lose all our money on that
damn chain of Fotomats!

274
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,319
It wasn't Daddy's fault that
those little things blew over

275
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,954
every time there was a storm.

276
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,722
Hmm.

277
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,098
Seriously, I'm melting.

278
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,024
Dead armadillo.

279
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,296
That's three for me.

280
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,366
This is a terrible driving game.

281
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,470
Is it roadkill if it's still twitchin'?

282
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:09,305
Huh, both alive and dead,
just like Schrodinger's cat.

283
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,141
I didn't know he had a cat.

284
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:12,709
You've heard of Schrodinger?

285
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,711
Sure. It's the kid from Charlie Brown

286
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:15,979
who plays the piano.

287
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:18,281
Lucy's got a crush on him.

288
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:21,384
Schrodinger's cat is
a thought experiment.

289
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,027
A cat in a box is exposed to poison,

290
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,790
and is both alive and
dead until it is observed.

291
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,792
So the cat's name is Schrodinger?

292
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:29,959
No.

293
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:31,427
Well, what's its name?

294
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,096
Its name doesn't matter.

295
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:34,631
It does if the cat was dead.

296
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,766
Otherwise, what are you
gonna put on his tombstone?

297
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:39,102
Not likely the cat's
getting a tombstone.

298
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,804
It would in a pet cemetery.

299
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,438
Fine, the cat's name is Mittens.

300
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,242
Because he has little white feet?

301
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,605
Sure.

302
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,679
So, in this thought experiment,

303
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,248
do you think Mittens is dead or alive?

304
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,204
There's no way of saying
until you open the box.

305
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,153
Oh, come on.

306
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,490
Optimistically, I would
choose to believe he's alive.

307
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:01,394
Yes!

308
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:02,600
Oh, thank goodness.

309
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,302
Oh, dead crow.

310
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,072
There ain't no doubt about that one.

311
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:14,063
The toilet was sanitized
for my protection.

312
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,559
I love this place.

313
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,195
Dad, can we go to Reptile World?

314
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,697
- No.
- They a got snake

315
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,732
so big it can eat a whole chicken.

316
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,934
Oh, well, in that case, no.

317
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:25,836
- Aw.
- Let's get some sleep.

318
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,929
We got to get up early if we're
gonna get to Cape Canaveral

319
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:29,239
in time for liftoff.

320
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,201
I'm so excited, I don't know if I can.

321
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:33,410
Well, buddy, you're gonna
have to try, all right?

322
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,846
You two share that
bed, I'll take this one.

323
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:37,414
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

324
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,896
Come on, fellas, I'm the biggest.

325
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,396
It makes sense that
I get a bed to myself.

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,679
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

327
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,227
We'll flip for it. Georgie, call it.

328
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,829
Heads.

329
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,331
Not your day.

330
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,599
Dang it.

331
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:58,435
- That looked like heads.
- Go brush your teeth.

332
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:03,507
This really works?

333
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:08,412
Your hair will look
just as pretty tomorrow.

334
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:11,649
Now, come on, let's tuck you in.

335
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,851
I'm glad I don't have orange hair.

336
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,319
Me, too, baby.

337
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,121
I want to be more like Madonna.

338
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,771
Are you trying to kill me?

339
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:20,240
'Cause if you are, good job.

340
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,047
Why is she only like a virgin?

341
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,639
Good night!

342
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,570
You ready to finish our conversation?

343
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:34,938
There's nothing to finish.

344
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,936
I raised myself like a jungle child.

345
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:37,967
End of story.

346
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,411
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

347
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:41,645
You think I didn't feel bad

348
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:44,248
not being around more
than I wanted to be?

349
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,616
Did you?

350
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,702
A little bit.

351
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,854
I'm teasing, come on. Of course I did.

352
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,823
Why else would I have
begged you and George

353
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:53,924
to move back to Medford?

354
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,693
So you could be with your grandchildren.

355
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:56,627
And you.

356
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,495
- Really?
- Yeah.

357
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,664
You're the only one of my
children still talking to me.

358
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,932
No surprise there.

359
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:04,968
Besides, you raised yourself
better than I ever could.

360
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,037
You actually believe that?

361
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,335
No, but it would help
my cause if you did.

362
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,686
Your hair looks pretty.

363
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,038
Enough.

364
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,964
Dad?

365
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,757
Dad?

366
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:38,535
Dad?

367
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,702
Dad.

368
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:41,837
What?

369
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,574
Georgie keeps kicking me.

370
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:45,075
Kick him back.

371
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,905
I'd rather not touch him.

372
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:51,582
You want to sleep with me?

373
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,030
Yes, thank you.

374
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:57,936
Yeah.

375
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,858
Got enough room?

376
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,595
Yes.

377
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,235
You throw off a lot of heat.

378
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,499
Sorry.

379
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:16,570
That's all right. It's kind of nice.

380
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,621
Do they launch those
shuttles in the rain?

381
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:33,194
I think a light rain's okay.

382
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,562
Oh, no.

383
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,230
It'll pass.

384
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,944
Just get some sleep.

385
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,889
It didn't pass.

386
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,991
Sheldon, I'm real sorry.

387
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,754
Can I tell you a secret?

388
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,223
I never understood how lightning works.

389
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:08,826
Didn't they teach you
that in high school?

390
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:10,027
They probably did,

391
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,331
but I got hit in the head
a lot playing football.

392
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,500
Would you explain it to me?

393
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:19,870
Well, when positive and negative
charges grow large enough,

394
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:22,172
a giant spark occurs in the cloud.

395
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:25,843
Ah, that-that's pretty cool.
What causes the thunder?

396
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:30,214
It's a shock wave from particles
heated to 10,000 degrees.

397
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,448
Interesting.

398
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,671
You want to know what's
really interesting?

399
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,919
Aristotle thought that
the sound of thunder

400
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,088
was due to a collision
between two clouds.

401
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,257
He believed the clouds
were expelling air,

402
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,192
in the way a log on a fire crackles...

403
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:45,095
I didn't realize until years later

404
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:47,598
that my father was only asking questions

405
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,701
about lightning and
thunder to cheer me up.

406
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:53,203
In fact, he would
often pretend to be dumb

407
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:54,938
just to make me feel better.

408
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,585
Looks like rain.

409
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,675
My brother, on the other hand,

410
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,310
didn't have to pretend.

411
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:08,429
Okay, on the count of
three, we run to the car.

412
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:11,166
- Ready? One, two...
- Wait.

413
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,635
I want shotgun going back.

414
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,638
Fine, you get shotgun. Okay, here we go.

415
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,740
- One, two...
- I still think

416
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,642
we should wait till the rain slows down.

417
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,243
No, we got to get home.

418
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:23,245
I got work tomorrow,
you guys got school.

419
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:24,869
You do realize I'll get wet?

420
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,415
It's just water, Sheldon.

421
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:29,118
All right. Just making sure you realize.

422
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,320
All right, here we go. Ready?

423
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:33,158
One, two, three.

424
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,030
Buddy, I thought we had a plan.

425
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,644
You had a plan.

426
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,863
I never did get to
see a launch in person,

427
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,963
but that was the best trip I ever had.

428
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:26,436
I wish I had told my
father while he was alive.

429
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,818
