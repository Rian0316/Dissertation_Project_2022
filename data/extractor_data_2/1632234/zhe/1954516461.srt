1
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,120

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,960
Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,290
Here. Breathe into this bag.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,760
What's going on?

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,430
They stole everything, Leonard!

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,900
Everything.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,630
Are you the roommate?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,700
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,940
Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,870
Oh, my God, what did they get?

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,180
What didn't they get?

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,110
They got my enchanted weapons,

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,080
my vicious gladiator armor,

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,420
my wand of untainted power,

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,980
and all my gold!

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,190
You called the police

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,990
because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,430
What choice did I have?

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,590
The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf,

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,400
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,600
has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun.

22
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,600
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,110
Into the bag.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,410
They took my battle ostrich!

25
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,750
- Oh, no, not Glenn! - Yes!

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,120
Glenn!

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,280
The only bird I ever loved.

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,590
Good luck, fellas.

29
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,290
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,560
Wait a minute!

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,060
You're not going to do anything?

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,230
Mr. Cooper, there's nothing...

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,730
Dr. Cooper.

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Seriously?

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,170
Not the kind with access to drugs.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,140
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,570
I'm sorry for your loss,

38
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,110
but the Pasadena Police Department

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,340
doesn't have jurisdiction in...

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,240
Pandora.

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,910
That's from Avatar

42
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,250
World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth.

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,120
Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun?

44
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,260
Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,590
What?

46
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,400
Wh-- you know, one who was drummed off the force

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,230
because he refused to play by the rules,

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,930
and now he hires himself out

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
to impose his own brand of rough justice?

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,870
No.

51
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,940
Thank you, officer.

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,450
It's all gone. All gone.

53
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.

54
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,980
What kind of world do we live in,

55
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,950
where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?

56
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,820
I don't know.

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,190
This act of aggression must be met

58
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,560
with swift and cruel ferocity.

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,200
It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,370
I'm on it.

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,470
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there?

62
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,640
Okay, thanks.

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,140
That particular dog of war

64
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,250
will have to call you back after his bath.

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,180
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Three thousand hours.

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,440
Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse,

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,410
collecting weapons and gold.

69
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,310
It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,910
Whoever did this knew what they were doing.

71
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,950
He got in and out of your account in under

72
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,450
15 minutes, transferred all your stuff,

73
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,680
and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.

74
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,950
Oh!

75
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,490
There isn't enough chamomile tea in the world

76
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,390
to quell the rage in my heart.

77
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,090
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

78
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,660
under the bridge in Thunder Bluff

79
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,500
who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Can we trust him?

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,330
I should say so; he appears to be a member

82
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,840
of the Nigerian royal family.

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,210
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jeweled ostrich bridle!

84
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,340
No. Glenn's was leather.

85
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,380
He was a simple ostrich.

86
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

87
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,150
Hey.

88
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,390
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.

89
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,090
Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.

91
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,160
What-- "that game"?

92
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,100
Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game.

93
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,770
Angry Birds is a game.

94
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,270
World of Warcraft is a

95
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,410
massively multi-player online role-playing...

96
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,340
all right, technically it's a game.

97
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,810
Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

98
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,050
Okay, well, anyways, I brought you

99
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,620
a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,190
Stale pastry is hollow succor

101
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,660
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
Just say "thank you".

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,530
I thought I just did.

104
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,360
All right. See you later.

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,460
Oh! Hello.

106
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh, hi!

107
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,510
I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon.

108
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,900
He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap

109
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,470
that's useful in a make-believe place.

110
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,810
I don't know what that means.

111
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,640
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,770
Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard

113
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,170
rollerblading at the beach?

114
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,940
Can you believe that?

115
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,910
I feel like I'm supposed to say "that bitch",

116
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,440
but I don't have enough information.

117
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,810
I am the one who spent two years

118
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,050
trying to get him to even

119
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,650
go to the beach in the first place.

120
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,720
And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste,

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,620
I had to carry him to the water.

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,320
I took Howard to the beach once.

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,390
He almost burst into flames like a vampire.

124
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,560
So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard

125
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,270
into quality boyfriend material?

126
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,430
I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.

127
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,100
I think you're on.

128
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,370
That bitch!

129
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,110
Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?

130
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,010
Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure

131
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,510
Mother warned me about.

132
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,350
I was starting to think it was never going to happen.

133
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,090
Yes, please.

134
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,790
You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him.

135
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,790
There was no eye contact.

136
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,190
He was either looking up at the ceiling,

137
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,860
or down at his shoes.

138
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,790
I'm drunk.

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
You know, for the first couple of months,

140
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
whenever I would take off my bra,

141
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,240
he would giggle and say, "Oh, boy, my breast friends"!

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,510
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

143
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

144
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,510
No, don't do that.

145
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,080
No reason to be mean to her.

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,480
This may be the alcohol talking...

147
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,750
but I believe there is.

148
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,890
Are you familiar with the recent study

149
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,320
of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka

150
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,560
out of Kyoto University?

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,790
No, but I can name all the Kardashians.

152
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,700
Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct

153
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,330
to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop.

154
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,670
Bernadette's urge to

155
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,470
shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya

156
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,710
is hard-wired into her DNA.

157
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,610
I don't have an urge to fling my waste.

158
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,980
Believe me, it's there, we all have it.

159
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,110
Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,590
All right, here we are -- this is the tavern

161
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,220
where all the black-market weapon trades go down.

162
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,030
I don't think my character should be in a place like this.

163
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,230
Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.

164
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,400
Maybe if you stop dropping your sword

165
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,630
and bending over to pick it up.

166
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,740
Okay, what exactly are we looking for?

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,770
Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly.

168
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,800
According to the message boards,

169
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,340
if you want to move stolen goods

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,480
and it's after school hours, he's your guy.

171
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
Leonard, is this going to take much longer?

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,980
I thought we were going to spend some time together.

173
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,410
Uh, we are. In the meantime,

174
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,180
you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.

175
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,750
Seriously?

176
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,350
Well, you have to put in a credit card number,

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,320
but it's fun.

178
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,090
Maybe I should just go home.

179
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,590
Our troll just walked in! I got him!

180
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,430
We got him. We're almost done.

181
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,730
So, how do you guys want to play this?

182
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,270
Be ruthless. You tell him

183
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,570
if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint

184
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,500
with his Internet service provider.

185
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,890
Sheldon,what if he gets his Internet

186
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,940
from his cable company?

187
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,500
He could lose his HBO

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,880
and all their delightful original programming.

189
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,250
I don't care! I'm losin' it, man!

190
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,680
Why don't we play this smart?

191
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,990
Try a little "good goblin, bad goblin."

192
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,060
Oh, dear Lord.

193
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,320
Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,290
Okay, I see where this is going.

195
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,860
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

196
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,970
That's not where it was going.

197
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,200
Good, because I would hate that.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,180
Leonard, you're busy-- let's talk tomorrow.

199
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,880
Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,280
No, no, I think it's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

201
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,980
Good, good.

202
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,020
I'll tell you what happens.

203
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,890
And people think I don't get sarcasm.

204
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,030
Well, well, well.

205
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,600
Look who it is.

206
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,670
Okay, be nice.

207
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,870
Hello.

208
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,800
Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.

209
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,810
Because I do that now.

210
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,840
Count your blessings

211
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,010
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

212
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,180
What?

213
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,150
Don't listen to her--

214
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,050
she's had a lot of ice cream.

215
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,980
Do you want to join us?

216
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,650
Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.

217
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,220
Four women walk down the stairs--

218
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,830
how many reach the lobby?

219
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,710
Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?

220
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,650
Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this.

221
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,310
I'm not going to be your go-between.

222
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,480
Come on, help me out.

223
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,880
Am I in trouble?

224
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,850
There's no reason to worry.

225
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,990
That's a relief.

226
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,290
I'm sure many women

227
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,520
in happy relationships spend their nights

228
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,920
Skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Good news, gentlemen-- I found our hacker.

230
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,130
What? Really?

231
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,700
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

233
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
not even topless Natalie Portman.

234
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,740
I've never said these words before,

235
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,140
but good job, Howard!

236
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,680
Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki,

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,850
2711 Ocean View Road,

238
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,420
Carlsbad, California.

239
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,420
The name and the address drip with evil.

240
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,760
What else do we know about him?

241
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,590
Why, quite a bit, actually.

242
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,790
I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents.

243
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,970
Yes, he does live with his parents.

244
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,270
Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.

245
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,240
Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac.

246
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,410
We can box him in.

247
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,340
Hold on, you're thinking of going there?

248
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,650
Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.

249
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,780
Fine.

250
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,720
You walk up to the house, knock on the door

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?

252
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,950
I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard,

253
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,790
but there have been some terrific advancements

254
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,360
in the field of torture.

255
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,830
No one's getting tortured.

256
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,060
Fine, we'll abide by the Geneva Convention.

257
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,500
But ask yourself this:

258
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,530
in the course of our lives,

259
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,870
how much lunch money has been taken from us?

260
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,640
How many kites?

261
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,370
How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,510
I totally had one of those.

263
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,910
Of course you did.

264
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,450
It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work.

265
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,820
But the bullies took it from us.

266
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,780
Well, no more.

267
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,950
Tonight, we take back our dignity,

268
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,050
our birthright and our pride.

269
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,220
What do you say?

270
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,720
Who's with me?

271
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,600
I have a hip-hop aerobics class at 5:00; could we go after?

272
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,070
Sure.

273
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,130
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

274
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,700
and my mother and I have a tradition of

275
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,910
lighting the candles and watching Wheel of Fortune, so...

276
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,940
If we could leave at 8:00,

277
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,240
we'd still be able to

278
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,840
regain our birthright at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

279
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,940
Fine.

280
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,250
Leonard?

281
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,950
Oh, geez, I-I don't know if I can ditch Priya

282
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,250
two nights in a row.

283
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,420
Oh, come on, man.

284
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,090
Bros before...

285
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,990
...my sister.

286
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,230
Aw, screw it.

287
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,330
- I'm in. - Me, too.

288
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,200
And me.

289
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,230
One moment.

290
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,970
I'm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal,

291
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,210
not the common cold.

292
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,380
I'm sorry, I thought this delay was

293
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,680
so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.

294
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,950
I am.

295
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,550
She's just bleaching her mustache.

296
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,760
Check it out.

297
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,920
Hey, Ma! "Before and After!"

298
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,360
Four words, 17 letters, two N's, one V!

299
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,800
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

300
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,270
That's incredible.

301
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,940
Yeah, she's kind of a Wheel savant.

302
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,170
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

303
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,840
Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.

304
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,840

305
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,510
Hit the...

306
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,970
Hey, sweetie.

307
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,240
Yeah, I'm sorry.

308
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,140
I'm gonna be working late.

309
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,450
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

310
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,450
Okay, sure, I'll call you when I get home.

311
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,950
Okay, bye-bye.

312
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,220
Very nice.

313
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
You lie to my sister.

314
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,620
That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.

315
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,470
Oh, guess who.

316
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,000
Cover for me.

317
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,340
Hello, Priya. What's up?

318
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,710
How would I know if Leonard's at work or not?

319
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,240
Don't be suspicious.

320
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,010
Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard

321
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,680
to continue, you're going to have to believe

322
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,480
whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse

323
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,680
the white devil has the nerve to offer you.

324
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,420
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

325
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,260
You owe me.

326
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,030
New puzzle, Ma!

327
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,300
"Same name"!

328
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,000
One N, two D's, three O's!

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,700

331
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,030
That's uncanny.

332
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,870
I know. It's her superpower.

333
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,940
Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.

334
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,440
I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego

335
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,250
to confront this guy.

336
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,850
Yeah, we're kind of bad-asses, aren't we?

337
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,220
Totally.

338
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,680
Hey, how about we stay the night

339
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,150
and hit Legoland in the morning?

340
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,760
Sea World is better.

341
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,790
It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun.

342
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,100
But for the moment, let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.

343
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,730
Yeah, we're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki.

344
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,240
And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.

345
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,600
I almost feel sorry for the poor fool,

346
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,310
sitting in his split-level suburban ranch,

347
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,540
unaware that a vengeful horde

348
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,350
is barreling down the San Diego Freeway

349
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,580
at 71 miles an hour.

350
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,050
Ease up there, lead foot.

351
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,520
You trying to get us killed?

352
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,760
I took the liberty of burning us

353
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,860
a mix of heroic questing music.

354
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,130
This says "Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix."

355
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,830
It's a re-writable CD.

356
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,730
Just put it in.

357
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,470
Beyonce? Really?

358
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,300
She's curvy and she owns it.

359
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,840
I like that.

360
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,040

361
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,250
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

362
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,080
We are winged fury!

363
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,490
Which is still no excuse

364
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,390
for going over the posted speed limit.

365
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,900
Next time we go to kick someone's ass,

366
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,500
we take the train.

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,430
I always prefer the train.

368
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
Sheldon, let's go.

369
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,970
Coming.

370
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,810
Why did you bring that?

371
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,840
No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart

372
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,850
than a Klingon bat'leth.

373
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,020
Okay, let's get clear on something.

374
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,090
We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of

375
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,920
your stuff back into your account and then be on our way.

376
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,420
No one's bat'lething anybody.

377
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,290
So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?

378
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,830
No.

379
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,470
Well, now I just feel silly holding it.

380
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,140
Come on.

381
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,440
Can I at least kick down the door?

382
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,410
You're welcome to try, but the other day,

383
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,140
it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.

384
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,580
Who is it?

385
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,380
Your doom!

386
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,680
Don't say "your doom."

387
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,090
Who opens the door for their doom?

388
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,460
Good point.

389
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Basket of puppies.

390
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,190
What?

391
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,860
Uh...

392
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,730
Sheldon?

393
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,900
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

394
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,570
Yeah. Who are you?

395
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,740
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

396
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,380
I want my things back.

397
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,510
I don't think so.

398
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,710
Let me see that.

399
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,010
Careful. That's a collectible.

400
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,110
I know.

401
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,180
I've always wanted one.

402
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,890
Well, he's even more cunning than we thought.

403
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,470
You know, the joke's on him.

404
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,800
Without the certificate of authenticity,

405
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,440
that bat'leth is worthless.

406
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,110
Yeah, he walked right into our trap.

407
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,080
Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.

408
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,650
Uh-oh.

409
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,390
- What's the matter? - Something's wrong.

410
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,990
I'm not getting any gas.

411
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,460
Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?

412
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Of course.

413
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,970
- 19th-century technology. - Very basic.

414
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,300
Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?

415
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,740
- No. - No. - Not a clue.

416
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,870
Well, we'd better call somebody to come pick us up.

417
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,740
It'd be swell if they had a train.

418
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,650
Thank you, Penny.

419
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,920
No problem.

420
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,450
So, Leonard,

421
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,520
I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend

422
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
to come get you.

423
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,190
Uh, I kind of told her I was working.

424
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,030
So you lied to her.

425
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,900
Also interesting.

426
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,470
Yeah, she doesn't really understand

427
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,730
the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.

428
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,370
Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.

429
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,040
This one's funny, Leonard.

430
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,480
How come you couldn't make it work with her?

431
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,250
So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?

432
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,550
No. We failed in our noble quest.

433
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,620
How come?

434
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,160
Todd Zarnecki was mean.

435
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,690
All right. Hang on.

436
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,130
What are you doing?

437
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska.

438
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,870
Oh. Beyonce.

439
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,970

440
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,680
This ain't no Beyonce.

441
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,270
Now what?

442
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,270
Give my friend his stuff back.

443
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

444
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,610
Well, then, good news.

445
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,650
Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you

446
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,050
in your little special place.

447
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,820
Now give him his stuff back.

448
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay.

449
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,820
We did it!

450
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,260
I said, "we."

451
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,940
Oh, hold the door.

452
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,610
- Oh, hi. - Hi.

453
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,010
Going to see Leonard?

454
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,010
Yes.

455
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,350
How have you been?

456
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,710
Fine. You?

457
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,920
Very well, thank you.

458
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,220
All right, well, great seeing you.

459
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,430
Yeah. You, too.

460
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,900
Amy's right.

461
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,670
I do want to fling my poop at her.
