1
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:09,146
Why hast thou forsaken me,
oh, deity, whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,819
Here, breathe into this bag.

3
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,961
- What's going on?
- They stole everything, Leonard.

4
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,326
Everything.

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,227
- Are you the roommate?
- Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

6
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,497
Your friend called 911
to report a robbery.

7
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,368
Oh, my God, what did they get?

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,633
What didn't they get?

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,540
They got my enchanted weapons,
my Vicious Gladiator armor...

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:37,343
...my Wand of Untainted Power
and all my gold.

11
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:39,679
You called the police...

12
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:43,187
...because someone hacked
your "World of Warcraft" account?

13
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,722
What choice did I have?

14
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,918
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf...

15
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,858
...hero of the Eastern Kingdoms...

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,694
...has been picked clean
like a carcass in the desert sun.

17
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,766
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

18
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,204
Into the bag.

19
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,902
They took my battle ostrich.

20
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,344
- Oh, no, not Glenn.
- Yes. Glenn.

21
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:11,314
Only bird I ever loved.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,085
Good luck, fellas.

23
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:15,779
Oh, thank you, officer.

24
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,550
Wait a minute.
You're not going to do anything?

25
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:21,024
- Mr. Cooper, there's nothing...
- Dr. Cooper.

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,759
Seriously?

27
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,462
Not the kind with access to drugs.

28
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:32,069
Fine. Dr. Cooper,
I'm sorry for your loss...

29
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,609
...but the Pasadena Police Department
doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.

30
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,213
That's from Avatar.

31
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,941
"World of Warcraft" takes place
in Azeroth.

32
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,144
Goodness gracious,
how are you allowed to carry a gun?

33
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:51,721
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

34
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:53,892
What?

35
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,622
One who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules.

36
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:02,462
And now he hires himself out to impose
his own brand of rough justice?

37
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,128
No.

38
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,337
Thank you, officer.

39
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,910
It's all gone. All gone.

40
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,339
- I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
- What kind of world do we live in...

41
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:19,384
...where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,114
I don't know.

43
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:26,025
This act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity.

44
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:30,630
It is time to cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war.

45
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm on it.

46
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:39,630
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is Howard there?

47
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,207
Okay, thanks.

48
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:46,505
That particular dog of war
will have to call you back after his bath.

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,277
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

50
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,941
Three thousand hours.

51
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:25,051
Three thousand hours clicking on that
mouse, collecting weapons and gold.

52
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:29,047
It's almost as if
it was a huge waste of time.

53
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,782
They knew what they were doing.

54
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,655
He got in and out of your account
in under 15 minutes...

55
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:38,025
...transferred all your stuff,
didn't leave a digital fingerprint.

56
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,065
Oh, there isn't enough chamomile tea
in the world...

57
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,896
...to quell the rage in my heart.

58
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:48,172
I'm talking to an orc under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff...

59
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:51,209
...says if we pay him,
he'll help us track down your things.

60
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,369
- Can we trust him?
- I should say so.

61
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:57,347
He appears to be a member
of the Nigerian royal family.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,353
Whoa, somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle.

63
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,854
No, Glenn's was leather.

64
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,150
He was a simple ostrich.

65
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,887
Is. Is. I haven't given up hope.

66
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,328
- Hey.
- Hey, Penny.

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,596
- We're in the middle of a crisis here.
- Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

68
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:20,797
I'm sorry, Sheldon,
I know that game meant a lot to you.

69
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,674
That game?

70
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,772
Excuse me, Penny,
but "Doodle Jump" is a game.

71
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,508
"Angry Birds" is a game.

72
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:35,849
"World of Warcraft" is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing...

73
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,854
All right, technically it's a game.

74
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:43,051
Bad news.
The Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

75
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:46,894
Okay, I brought you a day-old
cheesecake to cheer you up.

76
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,737
Stale pastry is hollow succor
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

77
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,740
- Just say thank you.
- I thought I just did.

78
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,372
All right, see you later.

79
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:01,840
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi.

80
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,716
I was just dropping off a cheesecake
to Sheldon.

81
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:07,046
He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap...

82
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,553
...that's useful
in a make-believe place.

83
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,090
I don't know what that means.

84
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,727
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

85
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,458
Did you know Priya took Leonard
Rollerblading at the beach?

86
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,260
Can you believe that?

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,300
I feel like I'm supposed to say
"that bitch"...

88
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,770
...but I don't have
enough information.

89
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,809
I am the one who spent two years
trying to get him to go to the beach.

90
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,916
He was so phobic about stepping
on medical waste, I had to carry him.

91
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,614
I took Howard to the beach once.

92
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,154
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

93
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,489
What's the thanks I get for turning
Leonard into quality boyfriend material?

94
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,755
I have to tiptoe
around his new girlfriend.

95
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,431
I think you're on.

96
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,432
That bitch.

97
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:00,366
You want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

98
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,704
Here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure
mother warned me about.

99
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,670
I was starting to think
it was never gonna happen.

100
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,915
Yes, please.

101
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,152
Should've seen Leonard when we met.
No eye contact.

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,721
He was either looking up at the ceiling
or down at his shoes.

103
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:17,948
I'm drunk.

104
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,686
For the first months
whenever I'd take off my bra...

105
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:27,698
...he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends."

106
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,728
If it makes you feel better,
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

107
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,465
No, don't do that.
No reason to be mean to her.

108
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,810
This may be the alcohol talking,
but I believe there is.

109
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,814
Are you familiar with the study
of Tanzanian chimpanzees...

110
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,919
...by Nishida and Hosaka
out of Kyoto University?

111
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,147
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

112
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,349
Primates such as ourselves
have a natural instinct...

113
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,893
...to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

114
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,190
Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl...

115
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:01,994
...or fling her waste at Priya
is hardwired into her DNA.

116
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,938
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

117
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:08,904
Believe me, it's there. We all have it.

118
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,270
Hit me with some more booze
and I'll show you.

119
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,240
All right, here we are.

120
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:19,010
This is the tavern where all
the black market weapon trades go down.

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,518
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

122
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,680
Everyone's undressing her
with their eyes.

123
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,858
Maybe if you stop dropping your sword
and bending over to pick it up.

124
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:34,189
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Redheaded troll by the name of Glumly.

125
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,859
According to this,
if you wanna move stolen goods...

126
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,597
...and it's after school hours,
he's your guy.

127
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,300
Is this going to take much longer?
We were gonna spend some time together.

128
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,738
We are. In the meantime...

129
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:47,574
...you're welcome to whip up
a character and join us.

130
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,807
Seriously?

131
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,646
Well, you have to put in
a credit card number, but it's fun.

132
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,552
Maybe I should just go home.

133
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,782
- Our troll walked in. I got him.
- We got him. We're almost done.

134
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,084
How do you guys wanna play this?

135
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:05,095
Be ruthless. Tell him if he doesn't start
talking, we'll register a complaint...

136
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,665
...with his Internet service provider.

137
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,237
Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet
from his cable company?

138
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:15,603
He could lose his HBO and all
their delightful original programming.

139
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,470
I don't care. I'm losing it, man.

140
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,341
Why don't we play this smart?
Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.

141
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,450
Oh, dear Lord.

142
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,450
No, I think we have to be more subtle.

143
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:30,784
Okay, I see where this is going.

144
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,051
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

145
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,322
That's not where it was going.

146
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,268
Good, because I would hate that.

147
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,863
Leonard, you're busy,
let's talk tomorrow.

148
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,166
Oh, wait, hang on. Are you upset?

149
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,607
No, no, I think it's sexy
to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

150
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,642
Good, good.
I'll tell you what happens.

151
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,075
People think I don't get sarcasm.

152
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,184
Well, well, well.

153
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,021
Look who it is.

154
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:11,164
- Okay. Be nice.
- Hello.

155
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:15,828
- We're just heading out for a drink.
- Because I do that now.

156
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:20,167
Count your blessings
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

157
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,370
- What?
- Don't listen to her.

158
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,204
She's had a lot of ice cream.

159
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:27,405
Do you wanna join us?

160
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,809
Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.

161
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:37,122
Four women walk down the stairs.
How many reach the lobby?

162
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,427
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

163
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:49,057
Don't put me in the middle of this.
I'm not going to be your go-between.

164
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,033
Come on, help me out.
Am I in trouble?

165
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:54,802
- There's no reason to worry.
- That's a relief.

166
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,603
Many women in happy relationships
spend their nights...

167
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,541
...Skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

168
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,341
Good news, gentlemen.
I found our hacker.

169
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:06,610
- What?
- Really?

170
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,254
Yeah, no one can hide from me.

171
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:12,153
Not Waldo, not Carmen Sandiego,
not even topless Natalie Portman.

172
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:17,427
I've never said these words before,
but good job, Howard.

173
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:22,192
Thanks.
Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki.

174
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,827
2711 Ocean View Road,
Carlsbad, California.

175
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:28,804
The name and the address
drip with evil.

176
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,975
- What else do we know about him?
- Quite a bit, actually.

177
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:35,012
I bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

178
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,355
Yes, he does live with his parents.

179
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,682
Here's a Google Earth shot
of their house.

180
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,727
Excellent. It's in a cul-de-sac.
We can box him in.

181
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:55,024
- Hold on, you're thinking of going there?
- Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.

182
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,971
You walk up to the house, knock
on the door and demand your stuff back.

183
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:02,336
- What if he says no?
- I don't know if you've been following...

184
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:05,637
...but there have been some advancements
in the field of torture.

185
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,241
No one's getting tortured.

186
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,475
Fine, we'll abide
by the Geneva Convention.

187
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:12,982
But ask yourself this:

188
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:17,255
In the course of our lives, how much
lunch money has been taken from us?

189
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,090
How many kites?

190
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,625
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

191
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,994
- I totally had one of those.
- Of course you did.

192
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:27,895
A fun and practical way
of organizing your schoolwork.

193
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:31,269
But the bullies took it from us.
Well, no more.

194
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:35,397
Tonight, we take back our dignity,
our birthright and our pride.

195
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,936
What do you say? Who's with me?

196
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:46,012
I have a hip-hop aerobics class at 5,
could we go after?

197
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,513
- Sure.
- Also, tonight's the Sabbath...

198
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:53,625
...and my mother and I have a tradition
of lighting candles and Wheel of Fortune.

199
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,559
If we could leave at 8, we'd still regain
our birthright at 10, 10:30 latest.

200
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,556
Fine.

201
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,929
- Leonard?
- Oh, jeez...

202
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,970
...I don't know if I can ditch Priya
two nights in a row.

203
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:09,108
Oh, come on, man. Bros before...

204
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,238
...my sister.

205
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:17,873
- Screw it. I'm in.
- Me too.

206
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,609
And me.

207
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,117
One moment.

208
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:30,752
I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal, not the common cold.

209
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:38,004
I thought this delay was so you could
watch Wheel of Fortune...

210
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:41,697
...with your mother.
- I am. She's bleaching her mustache.

211
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,637
Check it out. Hey, Ma!

212
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:49,942
"Before and after," four words,
17 letters, two N's, one V!

213
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,947
Fanny pack of wolves!

214
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:57,589
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, she's kind of a Wheel savant.

215
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:00,993
Uh-oh. That's Priya.

216
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,826
Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool,
dude.

217
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,959
Hit the...

218
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,928
Hey, sweetie.

219
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:14,371
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna be working late.

220
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,676
I miss you too.

221
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,346
Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.

222
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,280
Very nice. You lie to my sister.

223
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,786
That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

224
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,264
- Guess who?
- Cover for me.

225
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,199
Hello, Priya. What's up?

226
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,004
How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

227
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,730
Don't be suspicious.

228
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,000
If you want your relationship
to continue...

229
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:53,168
...you have to believe whatever
wild-eyed, cockamamy excuse...

230
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:56,315
...the white devil has the nerve
to offer you.

231
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,545
Okay? Yeah. Bye-bye.

232
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:02,516
You owe me.

233
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,485
New puzzle, Ma!

234
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,321
"Same name," one N,
two D's, three O's!

235
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:11,089
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

236
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:14,165
- That's uncanny.
- I know. It's her superpower.

237
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:16,199
Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.

238
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,435
I can't believe we're going all the way
to San Diego to confront this guy.

239
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,078
Yeah, we're kind of badasses,
aren't we?

240
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,577
Totally.

241
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:31,715
Hey, how about we stay the night
and hit Legoland in the morning?

242
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,248
SeaWorld is better.

243
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,516
It has Shamu
who is literally tons of fun.

244
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:40,785
But for the moment,
let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.

245
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,451
Yeah.
We're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki.

246
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,758
And for the record,
Legoland is more interactive.

247
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:52,904
I almost feel sorry for the poor fool
sitting in his split-level suburban ranch...

248
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:57,908
...unaware that a vengeful horde is
barreling down the San Diego freeway...

249
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,909
...at 71 miles an hour.

250
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,844
Ease up there, lead foot.
You trying to get us killed?

251
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:08,985
I took the liberty of burning us a mix
of heroic questing music.

252
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,590
This says
"Beyoncé Bootylicious Dance Mix."

253
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:17,992
It's a rewritable CD. Just put it in.

254
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,728
Beyoncé? Really?

255
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:23,133
She's curvy and she owns it.
I like that.

256
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,572
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

257
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,409
We are winged fury.

258
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,575
Which is still no excuse
for going over the posted speed limit.

259
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,122
Next time we go to kick someone's ass,
we take the train.

260
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,291
I always prefer the train.

261
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,762
Sheldon, let's go.

262
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,164
Coming.

263
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,274
Why did you bring that?

264
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:08,346
No weapon strikes more fear into
a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.

265
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,507
Okay, let's get clear on something.

266
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,982
Just tell this guy
to transfer all your stuff...

267
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,315
...back into your account,
then be on our way.

268
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,719
No one's bat'lething anybody.

269
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,790
So my blade shall not taste blood
tonight?

270
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,423
No.

271
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:30,666
- Well, now I just feel silly holding it.
- Come on.

272
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:34,901
- Can I at least kick down the door?
- You're welcome to try...

273
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,669
...but the other day, it took you
15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.

274
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:45,175
- Who is it?
- Your doom.

275
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,048
Don't say, "your doom."
Who opens the door for their doom?

276
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:52,055
Good point. Basket of puppies.

277
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:56,554
What?

278
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,594
Uh...

279
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,889
Sheldon?

280
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,263
- Are you Todd Zarnecki?
- Yeah. Who are you?

281
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,707
I'm Sheldor of Azeroth.

282
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,172
I want my things back.

283
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,106
I don't think so. Let me see that.

284
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,745
Careful, it's a collectible.

285
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:17,581
I know. I've always wanted one.

286
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,526
He's even more cunning
than we thought.

287
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,060
You know, the joke's on him.

288
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:39,934
Without the certificate of authenticity,
that bat'leth is worthless.

289
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,034
Yeah, he walked right into our trap.

290
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,007
Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

291
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,142
Uh-oh.

292
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,912
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong. Not getting gas.

293
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:04,562
Anybody know anything
about combustion engines?

294
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:07,097
- Of course.
- Nineteenth-century technology.

295
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,497
Does anybody know how to fix
combustion engine?

296
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,796
- No.
- Not a clue.

297
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,969
We'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

298
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,636
It'd be swell if they had a train.

299
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,274
Thank you, Penny.

300
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,652
No problem.

301
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:32,190
So I think it's interesting you didn't
call your girlfriend to come get you.

302
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,654
I kind of told her I was working.

303
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:38,353
So you lied to her. Also interesting.

304
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,995
She doesn't really understand the whole
"Warcraft" adventure-role-playing thing.

305
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,605
Well, doesn't matter if she gets it,
as long as she's pretty.

306
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,437
This one's funny, Leonard.

307
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,669
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

308
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,111
Did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

309
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,979
No, we failed in our noble quest.

310
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:04,385
- How come?
- Todd Zarnecki was mean.

311
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:06,021
All right, hang on.

312
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,383
What are you doing?

313
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:11,291
I'm gonna show you
how we finish a quest in Nebraska.

314
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,090
Oh, Beyoncé.

315
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,865
This ain't no Beyoncé.

316
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:31,043
Now what?

317
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:34,710
- Give his stuff back.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:36,145
Well, then good news.

319
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:40,816
Today's the day a girl's finally gonna
touch you in your little special place.

320
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:46,995
- Now, give him his stuff back.
- Okay.

321
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,224
We did it!

322
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,701
I said, we.

323
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,346
Oh, hold the door.

324
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:02,872
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

325
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,883
- Going to see Leonard?
- Yes.

326
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,378
- How have you been?
- Fine.

327
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:12,149
- You?
- Very well, thank you.

328
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,300
- All right, well, great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too.

329
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:02,105
Amy's right.
I do wanna fling my poop at her.
