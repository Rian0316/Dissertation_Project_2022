Rebekah: You mean to tell me,
after all these years,

184
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:50,689
Marcel is alive and well?

185
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,857
Elijah: Quite.

186
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,575
Our brother seems to have
wandered into a war zone,

187
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,076
and I haven't been
able to find him.

188
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,412
Marcel, who Klaus sired
and brought up

189
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,197
beneath his own wing,
now rules a menagerie

190
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,900
of savage vampires
running wild,

191
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,952
killing in public for
any human to come upon.

192
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,620
Witches are held
in subjugation.

193
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,255
I doubt Niklaus
had any idea

194
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,673
what he was
walking into.

195
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,208
Sorry.
What was that?

196
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,242
I stopped
paying attention

197
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,511
at "our brother."
Rebekah...

198
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:14,713
Our hateful,
traitorous bastard

199
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,631
of a brother negated
any sympathy

200
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,617
I once had for him
by his repeated efforts

201
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,635
to ensure neither you
nor I know happiness

202
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,637
outside of his own
selfish universe.

203
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:24,439
Always and forever,
Rebekah.

204
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,274
That is what we once
swore to each other.

205
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,143
Consider this me
calling take-backs.

206
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,195
Oh, you've called
take-backs dozens of times

207
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,063
over the centuries,
and yet when our father

208
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,115
found us and chased us
from this very city...

209
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,935
I may be old, Elijah,
but I'm hardly senile.

210
00:09:36,936 --> 00:09:38,770
I know very well
I stuck with Klaus,

211
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,455
and not 3 years later,
he stuck a silver dagger

212
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,424
in my chest and sent me
into a magical slumber

213
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:43,441
for 90 years.

214
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,659
Do you know why?

215
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,994
Because I had
the audacity to try

216
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,129
and live my life on
my own without him.

217
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,415
No. I believe our brother
is in trouble.

218
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,167
So whatever is going on
between Marcel and the witches,

219
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,785
it's dire enough that
they'd risk

220
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,704
bringing an original
back to town.

221
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:56,855
The witches
have lured him here.

222
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,757
I'd like to know why.

223
00:09:58,758 --> 00:09:59,924
[Beep]

224
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:23,031
Oh, you got me into this, Jane.

225
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, give me the strength
to finish it.

226
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:28,870
[Creak]

227
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,088
[Slam]

228
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,021
The doors work,
you know.

229
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,807
Man: You're
doing magic?

230
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,642
I'm praying
to my dead sister.

231
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,944
Go ahead.
Pay your respects.

232
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,396
Don't make this
a thing, Sophie.

233
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:57,031
The hybrid was looking
for Jane-Anne.

234
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,850
Marcel wants
to know why.

235
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:01,786
I'd say ask her yourself,
but I guess you can't, see,

236
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,538
because Marcel killed her.

237
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,695
[Thud]

238
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,878
I'm Elijah.

239
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:31,883
Have you
heard of me?

240
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,267
Yes.

241
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,937
So why don't
you tell me

242
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,440
what business your family
has with my brother?

243
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,912
[Crickets chirping]

244
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:50,299
[Creak]

245
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,800
[Whoosh]

246
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,972
This is sacred ground,

247
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,690
which means vampires
have to be invited in...

248
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:06,065
But since I'm desperate,
come on in.

249
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:09,101
We can talk
freely here.

250
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:11,537
Then I suggest
you start talking.

251
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,323
What did your sister
want with Niklaus?

252
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,558
Isn't it obvious?

253
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,161
We have a vampire problem,
and we need help.

254
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,663
Marcel has an army
backing him.

255
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:23,432
The witches have been
trying to fight back.

256
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,117
We haven't had
much luck

257
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,469
until my sister
Jane-Anne met a girl,

258
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,688
a werewolf passing
through the quarter

259
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,974
from a small town
in Virginia.

260
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:36,010
She had a special
connection to your brother.

261
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:37,479
What kind
of connection?

262
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,648
Apparently, they spent
some time together.

263
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,267
One thing led
to another,

264
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,887
and now this special
werewolf girl,

265
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,688
she's pregnant,
and the father

266
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,640
of the child
she's carrying

267
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,943
is your brother Klaus.

268
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,644
It's impossible.

269
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,913
Nothing is impossible,
especially not

270
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,614
when it comes
to your brother.

271
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:58,150
Think about it.

272
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,186
They call him
the hybrid, right?

273
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,004
Bring her out.

274
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,355
Who the hell are you?

275
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,183
Give us a moment,
please.

276
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,621
So have they been
holding you here

277
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,706
against your will?

278
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,042
They lured me
out to the bayou

279
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:41,660
and grabbed me.

280
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:45,264
Then they did all these
weird, witchy tests,

281
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:48,217
not that I understand
how this could happen.

282
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,886
I mean, vampires
are dead.

283
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,087
They can't
have children.

284
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:54,306
Perhaps if you knew
my brother's story,

285
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,642
it might explain
how this is possible.

286
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,876
Here. If I may...

287
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,511
What are you doing?
Relax.

288
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,850
If you open
your mind to me,

289
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,383
I can show you.

290
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:15,444
In the beginning,
our family was human,

291
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,496
1,000 years ago now.

292
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:18,563
Come on, Henry.

293
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:19,948
Our brothers
are fighting again.

294
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:21,283
Elijah, voice-over:
Although our mother

295
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:22,417
dabbled in the dark arts,

296
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,069
we were largely just a family
trying to survive

297
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,071
at a time when it was quite
difficult to do so...

298
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,092
And, for better or worse,

299
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,911
we were happy.

300
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:35,012
That is, however,
until one night.

301
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:36,715
Our youngest brother
was killed

302
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,017
by our village's
greatest threat.

303
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:41,720
Mother!

304
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:43,138
Elijah, voice-over: Men that
could transform themselves

305
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,225
into wolves
during the full moon.

306
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,694
Our family
was devastated,

307
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,612
none more than Niklaus.

308
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,431
Desperate to protect
the rest of us,

309
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:55,400
our father forced
our mother to call

310
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:59,321
upon her black magic
in order to make us stronger.

311
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,206
Drink.

312
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,439
Drink.

313
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,328
Thus, the first
vampires were born,

314
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,780
but with this speed,
this strength,

315
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:13,885
this immortality
came a terrible hunger.

316
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:16,453
No one felt this hunger
more than Niklaus.

317
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,145
When he killed
for the first time,

318
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:25,062
he knew what he
truly was.

319
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:29,685
Aah! Aah!

320
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,737
Aah!

321
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,405
What is
happening to me?

322
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:36,658
No. Don't. Don't.

323
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:41,330
Klaus: Father,
no. It hurts.

324
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,700
Aah!

325
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:48,669
He's a beast,
an abomination.

326
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,289
[Growling]

327
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:55,060
He wasn't
just a vampire.

328
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:58,330
He was also
a werewolf.

329
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:02,167
That's how the werewolf
curse works,

330
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,635
isn't activated
until you take a life.

331
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:06,471
Niklaus was the result
of an indiscretion

332
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,041
our mother had hidden
from us all,

333
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:12,510
an affair with
a werewolf like yourself.

334
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,363
Elijah, voice-over:
Infuriated by this betrayal,

335
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,181
my father forced our mother
to cast a spell that would

336
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,201
suppress Klaus' werewolf side,
denying him any connection

337
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,986
with his true self.

338
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,238
Ah...

339
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,791
Elijah, Elijah,
hold him down.

340
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:30,161
Brother, please don't
let them do this to me.

341
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,213
Do it now, boy! Now!

342
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,385
Help me.

343
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:41,505
Your dad was a dick.

344
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:46,378
I'm Hayley,
by the way.

345
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,480
You should probably
know my name

346
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:51,483
if you're gonna tell me
your whole life story.

347
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:53,051
I mean, I know yours.

348
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,071
Your family
is legendary.

349
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:58,240
Your brother is
a notorious psycho

350
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:02,194
who I slept with,
classic me.

351
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,945
I cannot excuse
his behavior,

352
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:06,230
but you must understand

353
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:08,199
that our father
hunted him,

354
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,951
hunted us
for centuries.

355
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,903
Every time we found
a moment of happiness,

356
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:14,739
we were forced to flee,
even here in New Orleans,

357
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,541
where we were
happiest of all.

358
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,010
Not long after
Niklaus broke the spell

359
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,413
which prevented him
from becoming a hybrid,

360
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:24,049
he defeated our father.

361
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,268
I thought this
would make him happy,

362
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:29,253
but he's angrier
than ever.

363
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:32,757
Elijah: I wonder if,
perhaps, this baby

364
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:35,977
will be a way from my
brother to find happiness,

365
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:39,763
a way to save him
from himself.

366
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,485
Sophie: I'm glad
you feel that way

367
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:45,687
because we need
your help.

368
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,105
What, precisely,
is it that you want?

369
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,623
What does it have
to do with this girl?

370
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:50,409
We want to run Marcel
and his vampires

371
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,927
out of town.

372
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,944
Klaus is the key.

373
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:55,797
Everything Marcel knows
about being a vampire

374
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,632
he learned from Klaus.

375
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,502
Marcel trusts him,
looks up to him.

376
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:02,454
He won't see
the betrayal coming.

377
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,955
Yes. Well, as I'm sure
you're aware,

378
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:06,091
my brother Niklaus doesn't
like to be told what to do.

379
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:08,977
It's why
I brought you here.

380
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:11,329
Marcel drove the
werewolves out of town

381
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,098
decades ago.

382
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,400
Do you really think
he's going to welcome

383
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:17,918
a hybrid baby
to the neighborhood?

384
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:21,440
Convince Klaus
to help us,

385
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:23,091
and no one has to know
about the newest member

386
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,693
of the original family.

387
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:27,211
Sounds remarkably
like blackmail.

388
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:32,149
Like I said,
I'm desperate.

389
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,205
Well, then,

390
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,840
I have my work cut out
for me, don't I?

[Dixieland jazz playing]

392
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,978
Evening, Elijah.

393
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,713
Niklaus.

394
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,233
What an entirely
unwelcome surprise.

395
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:06,385
And what an entirely
unsurprising welcome.

396
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,604
Come with me.

397
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,472
I'm not going anywhere
till I find out

398
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:11,690
who's conspiring
against me.

399
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,526
I believe I just
found that out for you.

400
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,865
No. It's impossible.

401
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,250
I said the same
thing myself.

402
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,952
This is a lie.
You're all lying.

403
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,071
Vampires
cannot procreate.

404
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,005
But werewolves
can.

405
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,625
Magic made you
a vampire,

406
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,959
but you were born
a werewolf.

407
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,912
You're the original
hybrid,

408
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:35,748
the first of your kind,
and this pregnancy

409
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:38,583
is one of nature's
loopholes.

410
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,756
You've been with someone else.
Admit it!

411
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,758
Hey, I've spent days
held captive

in a freaking
alligator bayou

413
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,944
because they think
that I'm carrying

some magical
miracle baby.

415
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,898
Don't you think I
would've fessed up

416
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,149
if it wasn't yours?

417
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,568
My sister gave her life
to perform the spell

418
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,936
she needed to confirm
this pregnancy.

419
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:59,872
Because of Jane-Anne's
sacrifice,

420
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,458
the lives of this girl
and her baby

421

are now controlled
by us.

422
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,712
We can keep them safe,

423
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:08,915
or we can kill them

424
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,968
if you don't help us
take down Marcel.

425
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,420
So help me, Hayley
won't live long enough

426

to see her first
maternity dress.

427

Hayley: Wait. What?

00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,725
Elijah: Enough of this.

429
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:19,726
If you want Marcel dead,
he's dead.

430
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,561
I'll do to myself.
No.

431
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:23,363
We can't, not yet.

432
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,181
We have a clear plan
that we need to follow,

433
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,600
and there are rules.

with what you

wrongfully perceive
to be my weaknesses?

This is a pathetic
deception.

Screw this.
I'm out of here.

00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,756
It's a trick, Elijah.

448
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,960
No, brother.
It's a gift.

449
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,962
It's your chance.
It's our chance.

450
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,296
To what?

451
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,965
To start over, take back
everything we lost,

452
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,916
everything that was
taken from us.

453
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:27,587
Niklaus, our own parents
came to despise us.

Our family was ruined.

and since then,

have ever wanted,

manipulated.

460

So they're
manipulating you.

464
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:55,815
I'm gonna kill
every last one of them.

465
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:57,166
And then what?

466
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,334
Then you return
to Mystic Falls

467
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,786
to resume your life
as the hated one,

468
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,087
as the evil hybrid?

469
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,588
Is it so important to you
that people quake with fear

470
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,173
at the sound
of your name?

471
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,842
People quake with fear
because I have the power

472
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,460
to make them afraid.

473
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:08,761
What will this child
offer me?

474
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,429
Will it
guarantee me power?

in this person before me

recognize as my own brother.

Something
had to be done.

494

And the solution is to
bring in more vampires?

These aren't just
any vampires, Agnes.

496

They're
the originals.

can control the hybrid?

Not entirely certain
that I can, either,

but now that your coven
has drawn his ire,

501
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:46,738
I have a question.

502
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:48,473
What prevents my brother
from murdering you

503
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:51,192
instead of cooperating?

performed,

the one that
got her killed,

508

it didn't just
confirm the pregnancy.

509
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:12,130
It linked me to Hayley.

510

So anything
that happens to me

happens to her, which means
her life is in my hands.

Klaus may not care
about his own child,

513
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:24,559
but it's very clear what
it already means to you.

514

If I have to hurt Hayley
or worse to ensure

515
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:33,651
that I have your
attention, I will.

516

You dare threaten
an original?

nothing to lose.

518
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,829

519
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,882

to change his mind.

you run off to?

Oh, someone put you
in a mood.

00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,767
What can I do?

524
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,019
What you can do is,
you can tell me what

with the witches.

00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,468
prince of the city.

539
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:44,722
I'd like to know how.
Why?

540
00:26:46,158 --> 00:26:47,558
Jealous?

541
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:52,230
Hey, man, I get it.

542
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,865
300 years ago,
you helped build

543
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:56,016
a backwater penal colony
into something.

544
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:58,036
You started it,
but then you left.

545
00:26:58,037 --> 00:27:00,238
Actually,
you ran from it.

546
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:03,041
I saw it through.
Look around.

547
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,858
Vampires rule
this city now.

548
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,712
I got rid of
the werewolves.

549
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:08,879
I even found a way to
shut down the witches.

550
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,699
The blood never
stops flowing,

551
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,051
and the party
never ends.

552
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:14,536
You want to
pass on through?

553
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:16,204
You want to stay
a while?

554
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:17,872
Great. What's mine
is yours,

555
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:21,643
but it is mine...
My home,

556
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:24,762
my family, my rules.

557
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:29,101
And if someone
breaks those rules?

558
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,852
They die.

559
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:32,270
Mercy is for the weak.

560
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,239
You taught me that, too,

561
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,260
and I'm not the prince
of the quarter, friend.

562
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,829
I'm the King!

563
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,114
Show me some respect.

564
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,687
You're friend will be dead
by the weekend,

565
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:09,357
which means I've broken
one of your rules,

566
00:28:09,358 --> 00:28:13,310
and yet a cannot
be killed.

567
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,531
I am immortal.

568
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:24,271
Who has the power
now, friend?

569
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,377
Elijah: He's willing
to give up everything.

570
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:30,612
Come on, Elijah.

571
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,963
Does that really
surprise you?

572
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,800
I can already see it.
He's spiraling.

573
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,618
He's lashing out
in blind rage.

574
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,086
You know, the last time
I saw him like this,

575
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,621
it lasted 200 years.

576
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,006
Then leave him
to his temper tantrum

577
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,423
and come home.

578
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:44,593
With any luck,
this misadventure

579
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:47,462
will allow us a reprieve
from all of his insanity.

580
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:49,263
It was so close.

581
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:50,515
When he heard
the baby's heartbeat,

582
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:52,266
I could see it
in his eyes.

583
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:54,186
He wanted it.

584
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:58,273
He could almost taste
happiness,

585
00:28:58,274 --> 00:29:00,659
and now his temper
has destroyed it.

586
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,144
Even if I was to return
him to sanity,

587
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:05,530
he just lost
Marcel's trust.

588
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:09,367
So I'm almost out
of time to get the girl.

589
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:10,852
Get her?

590
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:12,237
Have you lost
your mind?

591
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:13,588
Are we running
an orphanage now?

592
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,040
Say what you will
about Niklaus,

593
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,591
but on my life,

594
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,294
I'm not letting anything
happen to that baby.

595
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:22,330
You find him,
and then you call me.

596
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:25,634
Don't worry.
I know how to deal with Klaus.

597
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:29,353
Elijah: Is that so?
Please elaborate.

598
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,774
Elijah Mikaelson.

599
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,110
No. I got it.
It's all good.

600
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:47,571
It's time we had
a little chat.

601
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,221
Well, if you're
gonna talk, talk.

602
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:57,506
I got things to do.

603
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,091
Oh, my, you have grown
quite confident

604
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,391
over the last century,
haven't you?

605
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,594
Me? I'd say it's you
and your brother got cocky,

606
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:04,395
come to my town
like you own the place.

607
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:06,148
Well, we did
own the place once.

608
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,733
We were all quite happy
here, as I recall,

609
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:09,234
but we could
never control

610
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:11,603
those pesky witches
at the French quarter.

611
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:13,255
How do you do it?

612
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:16,307
Hmm, brother asked me
the same question.

613
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,476
I gave him the same answer.
It's my business.

614
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:22,581
Everything in the quarter
is my business.

615
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,816
Klaus comes into town
all nice and friendly.

616
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:27,052
Then he starts looking
down his nose at what I done

617
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:28,754
like it's some
cheap knockoff

618
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,204
of one of his
dumb paintings.

619
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:32,023
Then he gets pissed off
like a little bitch

620
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:33,275
and bites
one of my guys.

621
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:35,811
Well, I do apologize for
Klaus' poor behavior.

622
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:37,796
I assume you know
that that bite

623
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:41,216
will kill your friend
within a matter of days.

624
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:47,139
Of course, Niklaus'
blood would cure him.

625
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,506
What?
Yes.

626
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:49,691
Apparently, the blood
of the hybrid

627
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,643
will cure
a werewolf bite,

628
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,845
quite a handy,
little thing

629
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:57,783
when one needs leverage
a negotiation.

630
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,502
What kind of negotiations
we talking about?

631
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,104
Return the body of
the witch Jane-Anne,

632
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,754
allow her people
to put her to rest.

633
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:06,357
What do you care
about the witches?

634
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:10,579
Well, that's my
business, now, isn't it?

635
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,530
[Bell tolling]

636
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:20,222
His time is up.

637
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:22,424
What are you gonna
do now, Sophie?

638
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:25,143
I'm gonna do what I said
I was gonna do.

639
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:28,045
Woman: What, kill the girl?
Kill yourself?

640
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,064
Klaus does not care
about the child.

641
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,483
Elijah: I do...

642
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,358
And I bring proof

643
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,912
of my intent to help you...

644
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:46,564
The body of
your fallen friend,

645
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:49,251
which I procured
from Marcel himself.

646
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:51,336
Oh, Jane-Anne.

647
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,921
May she
be granted peace.

648
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:01,096
Klaus will agree
to your terms.

649
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,931
I just need
a little more time.

650
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,582
You had your time.
It's passed.

651
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:08,270
Shut up, Agnes.

652
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:11,890
For now,
accept the deal.

653
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,659
The girl and the child
remain unharmed,

654
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,778
or Klaus
will kill you all...

655
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,904
And I will help him.

656
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,719
[Whoosh]

657
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,005
Have I not made clear
my desire to be left alone?

658
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,373
Oh, you demand
to be left alone

659
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:46,624
at least once a decade.

660
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,927
Your words have ceased
to have impact.

661
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:52,146
Why must you keep harping on
about the baby?

662
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:54,182
That child
will never be born.

663
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:58,068
In fact, Hayley is
probably dead already.

664
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:01,690
You will not walk
away from this.

665
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:05,642
Let me go.
No!

666
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,167
Don't make me
say it again.

667
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:15,669
I will not let you go.
I will never let go.

668
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,992
Even if I have
to spend eternity

669
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:23,762
saving you from your own
stubborn, petulant,

670
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:26,798
vile self,

671
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,301
if I have to beat you as
father used to beat you

672
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:31,886
to remind you
of your own humanity,

673
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,387
to care about anything.

674
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,897
[Clang]

675
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,684
You're beyond
pathetic, Elijah.

676
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:53,575
Who's more pathetic,

677
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:56,660
the one who sees hope to
make his family whole...

678
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,865
Or the coward

679
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,551
who can only see the world
through his own fear?

680
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:06,771
I haven't cared about
anything for centuries.

681
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:09,474
Why on earth do you?

682
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,558
Because I failed you.

683
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:17,032
Because the first time
our father laid a hand on you,

684
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:20,168
I should've
struck him dead,

685
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,903
and I made
a promise to you...

686
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:30,822
Always, forever
family above all.

687
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:40,455
Ha ha ha!

688
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:43,073
Ha ha ha!

689
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:52,766
You are
a sentimental fool.

690
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:55,469
Perhaps.

691
00:34:57,605 --> 00:35:01,275
I've lasted this long in
spite of it, haven't I?

692
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,924
Elijah, voice-over:
The bond of family blesses us

693
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:25,526
with an immeasurable power.

694
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:28,563
[Cell phone vibrating]

695
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:39,324
Elijah, voice-over: But we also
must accept what comes with it.

696
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:50,001
It gives us a responsibility
to love without condition...

697
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:54,806
Without apology.

698
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:07,102
We can never waiver
from the power of that bond,

699
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,303
even when it is tested.

700
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:17,078
The bond nourishes us,
gives us strength.

701
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:22,016
Without that power,
we have nothing.

702
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,872
This town was my home once,
and in my absence,

703
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:31,777
Marcel has got everything
I ever wanted...

704
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:37,777
Power, loyalty,
family.

705
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:42,053
I made him in my image,
and he has bettered me.

706
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,327
I want what he has.

707
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:51,613
I want it back.

708
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:53,915
I want to be King.

709
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,323
Elijah: So is that all
this child means to you,

710
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:05,494
a grab for power?

711
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:08,246
What does it
mean to you?

712
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:12,033
I think this child

713
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:13,535
can offer you
the one thing

714
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,871
that you've never
believed you had.

715
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,338
And what's that?

716
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:22,593
The unconditional
love of family.

717
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:32,854
Tell Sophie Deveraux
we have a deal.

718
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:44,916
[Coughing]

719
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,454
You all right?

720
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,405
Just dust.

721
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,240
This place
is ancient.

722
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:54,993
Yes. It should
serve our purposes.

723
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:59,680
It's a sanctuary from
our business in the quarter.

724
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,602
Right now, you're the
most important person

725
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:04,770
in this family.

726
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:06,938
You need a good home.

727
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:11,092
So I'm curious.

728
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,478
In all this time,
has anyone

729
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:14,396
asked you
how you feel?

730
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:15,614
About having
a miracle baby

731
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:17,832
with a psychotic
one-night stand?

732
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,867
About being a mother.

733
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:30,212
I...

734
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:32,498
I was abandoned
when I was born,

735
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:35,417
and my adoptive parents
kicked me out

736
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:38,253
the second that
I turned into a wolf.

737
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:42,558
So I don't really know

738
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,643
how I feel
about being a mother

739
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:50,232
because I never
really had a good one.

740
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,151
I will always
protect you.

741
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,354
You have
my word on that.

742
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,694
Klaus: And noble Elijah
always keeps his word.

743
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:03,946
Is it done?

744
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:05,664
As a matter of fact,
yes.

745
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:08,500
Your underhanded deal
worked quite well.

746
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:11,170
Marcel was only too happy
to accept my blood,

747
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,256
even as he accepted
my heartfelt apologies.

748
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:15,958
His man thierry yet lives,

749
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:19,094
and I remain a welcome guest
in the French quarter.

750
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,547
My own concern now

751
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:25,000
is this coven
of impudent witches.

752
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,269
I believe them
to be honorable.

753
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,638
They did
release Hayley,

754
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,674
though they haven't been
entirely forthcoming.

755
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,776
Marcel obviously
has something

756
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:36,778
that they need.

757
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:39,114
They don't
want him dead.

758
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,400
There must be
a reason why.

759
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:44,535
[Flame huffing]

760
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:02,203
I assume it's all
quiet out there?

761
00:40:02,204 --> 00:40:05,140
The witches know better
than to use magic.

762
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:07,892
They know I can sense it
when they do.

763
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:13,347
What about
the old ones?

764
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,600
They're dangerous,

765
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:15,717
and I don't want them
to hurt you.

766
00:40:15,718 --> 00:40:17,952
The originals?

767
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:21,105
Davina, as powerful
as you are,

768
00:40:21,107 --> 00:40:23,609
they don't stand
a chance.

769
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,494
In addition
to the secret weapon

770
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:26,995
he uses to control
the witches,

771
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:30,699
Marcel has assembled
a small army of vampires.

772
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,170
Working together, we could
destroy them from the inside.

773
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,872
And what of Rebekah?

774
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,257
Has she stopped her
pouting long enough

775
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,208
to join the fun?

776
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:44,095
She has made her
disinterest quite clear.

777
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,580
One too many times
daggered

778
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,633
and shoved in a box,
I gather,

779
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:51,270
or perhaps she
doesn't share

780
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:55,274
your unwavering belief
that I can be saved.

781
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,809
Rebekah may
surprise us yet.

782
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,313
After all, we all
swore the same vow.

783
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:06,935
I hope she stays
far away

784
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:10,621
because in my desire
to reclaim this town,

785
00:41:10,623 --> 00:41:13,125
to steal from Marcel
that which he holds

786
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:15,377
most dear,
I have realized

787
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:19,414
one massive
vulnerability,

788
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:23,251
one weakness that
Marcel could exploit.

789
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:25,136
And what is that?

790
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,973
You.

791
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:30,726
Waah! Uh!

792
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:32,344
Uh!

793
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:34,562
Forgive me,
my brother.

794
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:39,300
There is no
power in love.

795
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:45,300
Mercy makes you weak.
Family makes you weak.

796
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:51,747
If I'm ever going
to win this war,

797
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:54,248
I have to do it alone.

798
