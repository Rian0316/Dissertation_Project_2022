1
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,035
Watson.

2
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,911
Yes.

3
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,205
Watch.

4
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,420
The chemical reaction
you are about to witness

5
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:55,175
will solve the mystery
concerning the persecution

6
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,469
of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

7
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,887
Excellent,

8
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,889
the tobacco millionaire,
shall I take notes?

9
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,518
No, I will dictate
in the fullness of time.

10
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,734
There's a young lady wishes
to see you, Mr. Holmes.

11
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,821
This is not
a convenient moment!

12
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,574
She's very well spoken,
a genuine lady.

13
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,534
No doubt.

14
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,912
And persistent, too.

15
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,498
Mrs. Hudson, I, too,
am extremely persistent,

16
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,208
especially when I'm working.

17
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,420
It is a matter
of great urgency, Mr. Holmes,

18
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,048
or I would not be troubling you
on a Saturday evening.

19
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,722
Perhaps you could, uh, delay
your chemical reaction, Holmes.

20
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,765
Very well.

21
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,190
Do sit down, Miss, uh?

22
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,649
Violet Smith.

23
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,985
Dr. Watson.

24
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,530
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

25
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,950
A genuine lady,
I told you.

26
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,537
Oh, please.

27
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,958
Um, thank you,
I'll be quite happy here.

28
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,047
Very well, Miss Smith,

29
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,716
you must tell us
your matter of great urgency.

30
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,635
It is obviously
not your health.

31
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,096
So ardent a bicyclist
must be full of energy.

32
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,973
Yes, I bicycle a good deal.

33
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,935
Slight roughening on
the side of the soles

34
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,479
caused by the friction
of the pedals.

35
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,606
Excellent, Watson.

36
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,025
The marks on your shoes.

37
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,277
Oh, yes!

38
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,987
Even if I have
to travel a long way,

39
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,740
I take my bicycle on the train
with me as I did today.

40
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,369
You will excuse me,
but it is my business.

41
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,704
Yes, I nearly
fell into the error

42
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,374
of supposing you earned
a living by typewriting,

43
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,459
but of course,
it is obviously music.

44
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:56,713
You will observe, Watson,
the spatulate finger ends,

45
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,425
which is common
to both professions.

46
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,346
There is a spirituality
about the face, however,

47
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,431
which the typewriter
does not generate.

48
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,976
This lady is a musician.

49
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,312
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes,
I teach music!

50
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,607
In the country, I presume,
from your complexion.

51
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,111
Near Farnham
on the borders of Surrey!

52
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,493
But please, let me explain
why I am here.

53
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:35,502
I am an only child, and
my father died some years ago.

54
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,754
His name and profession?

55
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,047
James Smith,

56
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,301
he conducted the orchestra
at the old lmperial Theater.

57
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,846
Ah, the old lmperial, Holmes.

58
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,389
Yes.

59
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,808
Please continue.

60
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,398
My mother and I were left
without a relation in the world

61
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,151
except for one uncle,
Ralph Smith,

62
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,571
who went to Africa
15 years ago,

63
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,573
and we have not had a word
from him since,

64
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,993
despite our Christmas cards
and photographs.

65
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,956
Mr. Holmes,
I have to tell you that--

66
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,667
I think you wish to tell me

67
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,545
that you and your mother
are very poor,

68
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,591
not withstanding your obvious
grace, dignity and talent.

69
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,593
We were very poor.

70
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,719
Ah.

71
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,435
About four months ago,
in February,

72
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,687
we were told there was
an advertisement in the Times,

73
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,856
inquiring for
our whereabouts.

74
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,025
You can imagine
how excited we were,

75
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,819
for we thought that someone
had left us a fortune.

76
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,613
I went at once
to the lawyers

77
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,074
whose name was given
in the paper.

78
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,413
Now, this is
Miss Violet Smith.

79
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,000
The solicitor
introduced me to two men,

80
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,420
a Mr. Carruthers
and a Mr. Woodley.

81
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,674
They were on a visit
from South Africa.

82
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,145
I wish I could tell you your
uncle left you a vast fortune,

83
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,188
but as I said...

84
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,483
He died in extreme poverty.

85
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:26,864
However, I myself
am not without means.

86
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,120
My mother and I
never sought charity.

87
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:37,374
No, nor do I offer it.

88
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,628
Please.

89
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,009
I have a question
to ask of you.

90
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,053
Your Uncle Ralph
said you were very musical,

91
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,222
do you teach music?

92
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,849
Yes.

93
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,686
Miss Smith, I am now a widower
with a 10-year-old daughter.

94
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,771
Young Sarah.

95
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,277
She needs a music teacher.

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,654
So, you see,
I do not offer charity.

97
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:11,450
A job, he wants
to give you a job!

98
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,290
Whereabouts in London
do you live, Mr. Carruthers?

99
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,501
I don't.

100
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,922
I live about six miles
from Farnham, in Surrey,

101
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,049
at Chiltern Grange.

102
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,635
I couldn't possibly leave
my mother on her own.

103
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,597
I will pay you
100 pounds a year.

104
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,726
A hundred a year?

105
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,936
Yes.

106
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,438
Approximately double
the market price, I think.

107
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,190
Oh, at least!

108
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:48,362
Which you obviously accepted,
or you wouldn't be here now.

109
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,446
Yes.

110
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,406
I accepted the offer.

111
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,866
Mr. Carruthers agreed

112
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,911
that I should go home every
weekend to my mother in town.

113
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,330
So this is one of your
weekend visits to London?

114
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,124
It is.

115
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,378
Tell me about your life
at Chiltern Grange.

116
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,843
For a while,
it was quite perfect.

117
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:15,180
Every Monday morning I would
take the train to Farnham

118
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:19,226
and then bicycle from
the station to the house.

119
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,085
The little girl's
name was Sarah,

120
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,087
and she was delightful,

121
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:51,508
as well as being
a very good pupil.

122
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,804
That was very much
better, Sarah.

123
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,598
May I try it again?

124
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,976
Of course,
that's why we're here.

125
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,733
Mr. Carruthers was
appreciative of my work,

126
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,737
and an extremely kind
and considerate host.

127
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,449
Sounds idyllic.

128
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,950
It was.

129
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,872
What happened to spoil it?

130
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,665
A visitor.

131
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,792
Mr. Woodley.

132
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,462
However did you guess,
Mr. Holmes?

133
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:33,467
Miss Smith,
I never guess.

134
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,804
Tell me about his visit.

135
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,017
He arrived
and was to stay for a week.

136
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,523
But to me it seemed
like three months.

137
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:52,694
Oh, that odious
red mustache!

138
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,871
One evening after dinner,

139
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,123
Mr. Carruthers had
to leave us for a minute

140
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,918
to see somebody
at the door.

141
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,046
A gentleman
to see you, sir.

142
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,765
Will you excuse me?

143
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,223
That's better.

144
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,435
Better, in what way?

145
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,774
It's better to
get the old folk out of the way.

146
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,152
I don't regard
Mr. Carruthers as old.

147
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,447
Oh, yes,
but he isn't young...

148
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,240
like us.

149
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,036
I do wish you wouldn't blow
smoke in my face, Mr. Woodley.

150
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,956
Oh, I don't believe that
for a moment.

151
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
What don't you believe?

152
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,753
When women say they wish
you wouldn't do something,

153
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,172
it generally means
the exact opposite.

154
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,925
I mean precisely
what I say!

155
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,761
Mr. Woodley, will you please
leave me alone!

156
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,054
No.

157
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,640
To tell you the truth,
I won't leave you alone,

158
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,435
not until I've said
what's in my heart.

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,853
Whatever do you mean?

160
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,855
I'm not very
well up on the social graces,

161
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,819
but I'm prepared to learn,
if you're prepared to teach me.

162
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,822
Oh, this is absurd!

163
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,451
It isn't absurd!
I'm asking you to marry me!

164
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,330
I mean it,
it's from the heart.

165
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,790
Money isn't a problem,

166
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,626
I did very well
out in South Africa.

167
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,295
Whatever you are accustomed to,
I can give you better,

168
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,214
better that
you're accustomed to;

169
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,758
jewelry, diamonds.

170
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:24,555
You want diamonds,
oh, I can give you diamonds.

171
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,766
I don't want diamonds!

172
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,186
Oh, you think about it.
I won't rush you.

173
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,857
I've thought about it,

174
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,193
and the idea is ludicrous.

175
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,572
Well, you can't
blame me for trying!

176
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,324
You're very beautiful.

177
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,662
Listen, just to show
there are no hard feelings,

178
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,206
what about a little kiss
to be going on with, hmm,

179
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,708
just a peck on the cheek.

180
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,376
Mr. Woodley,
will you please stop it!

181
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,545
Oh, I told you before about
women who say stop it.

182
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,254
No!

183
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,506
The more they struggle,
the more fun it is.

184
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,301
Mr. Carruthers,
will you stop him!

185
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,103
Get out of this house!

186
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,771
All right!

187
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,732
I'm going.

188
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,527
I'm not interested
in old men,

189
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,114
and old maids!

190
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:30,704
I can only offer you

191
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,626
my most sincere apologies
for what has happened.

192
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,558
If I give you my assurance
that it will not happen again,

193
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:59,942
for my daughter's sake,
will you stay?

194
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:04,571
Yes, I will stay.

195
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,242
Thank you, Violet.

196
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:24,424
Mr. Woodley left the house
and I have not seen him since.

197
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,344
The blackguard!

198
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,058
Has there been any change

199
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,020
in the behavior
of Mr. Carruthers?

200
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:44,611
No, he continues to be polite
and considerate and courteous.

201
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,781
Now, Miss Smith, please,
please continue.

202
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:52,786
Yes, there is something else.

203
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,207
Oh, it may be
a mere fancy of mine,

204
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,170
but it seems to me
that Mr. Carruthers

205
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,297
shows a great deal
of interest in me.

206
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:08,468
Oh, he has never said anything,
he is a perfect gentleman,

207
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:12,764
but, a girl
always knows.

208
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,309
So I believe.

209
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,059
And I assume

210
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,604
that these feelings that
you sense from Mr. Carruthers

211
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,273
are not reciprocated?

212
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:26,236
He is a kind and generous
employer,

213
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,363
but I am already engaged.

214
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,492
Oh, the name of this
very fortunate young man is?!

215
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,953
Cyril Morton.

216
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,747
He's an electrical engineer

217
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:41,752
with the Midland Electric
Company in Coventry.

218
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,838
We're to be married
at the end of the summer.

219
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,133
We wish you joy.

220
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,885
Thank you.

221
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,305
Yet, I am puzzled as to why
you have chosen to consult me.

222
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,058
It is an intriguing story,
to be sure,

223
00:16:56,183 --> 00:17:01,188
but I sense you are frightened,
and do not understand why.

224
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,107
You seem well capable
of protecting yourself.

225
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:11,240
Please,
help me, Mr. Holmes!

226
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,620
What is it?

227
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,582
I am being followed.

228
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:27,589
Followed, by whom?

229
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,552
A cyclist.

230
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,470
Every Saturday morning

231
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,348
I bicycle from the house
to Farnham Station

232
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,518
to catch
the 12:22 to town.

233
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,897
There is one very quiet
and lonely stretch of road

234
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,150
that lies between Charlington
Heath on the one hand

235
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,153
and the woods of
Charlington Hall on the other.

236
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,574
Two weeks ago today,
I was passing this place

237
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:58,787
when I chanced to look back
and saw a man,

238
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:04,251
also on a bicycle.

239
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:08,380
The following Monday when
I returned he was there again.

240
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,007
I see.

241
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,219
And again last Saturday,
and again last Monday.

242
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,597
Have you mentioned this
to your employer?

243
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,015
Yes.

244
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,392
Mr. Carruthers
was very concerned,

245
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,060
and has ordered
a horse and trap

246
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:26,106
so that in the future I should
not travel unaccompanied.

247
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,150
But they've
not yet arrived.

248
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,445
And this morning?

249
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,572
He was following me again.

250
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,957
I slowed down,
but he did the same.

251
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:50,088
Then I stopped completely,
but he did the same.

252
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:55,552
So, I laid a trap for him.

253
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,152
There is a sharp
turning of the road,

254
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,196
and I pedaled very quickly
towards this

255
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,865
and then stopped
and waited.

256
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,166
But he seemed to disappear
into thin air.

257
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,836
Can you describe this man?

258
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,879
I realize that you've only
seen him from a distance.

259
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,589
Yes.

260
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:36,844
He wears a dark suit,
dark spectacles,

261
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,345
and he has a beard.

262
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,013
Young, old?

263
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,684
He's about middle-aged.

264
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,145
Now, let me see if I have
the geography correct.

265
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:52,276
Here is the road,
with a sharp bend in it here.

266
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,529
On this side,
Charlington Heath,

267
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:58,407
and on the other,
the woods of Charlington Hall.

268
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,868
How long did you wait for him
here around the bend?

269
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,411
Oh, no more than two minutes.

270
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,164
So he could not have retreated
back down the road.

271
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,707
Are there any side roads?

272
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,792
None along this stretch.

273
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,378
Could he have taken a footpath
across the heath?

274
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,006
Oh, the heath
is totally flat and bleak.

275
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,133
I think I would have
noticed him.

276
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,885
So, by a process of exclusion,

277
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,930
we arrive at the fact that
he made his way towards

278
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:22,764
Charlington Hall.

279
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,475
Now how does Mr. Carruthers
make his living?

280
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,895
Oh, he's a rich man.

281
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,939
But no carriages or horses.

282
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,859
Well, at least
he's very well off.

283
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,404
He goes into the city
two or three times a week,

284
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,700
and he sometimes refers
to his gold shares.

285
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:42,784
Yes, I see.

286
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,911
You must let me know
immediately

287
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,497
if there are any fresh
developments.

288
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,499
I am extremely busy
just now,

289
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:52,252
but I will find time to make
inquiries into your case.

290
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,129
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

291
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:58,717
In the meantime, take no step
without letting me know.

292
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,976
I'm sure we shall have nothing
but good news for you.

293
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:12,272
I do hope so, Dr. Watson.

294
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,280
Very lovely girl.

295
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,448
Yes.

296
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,617
And it is part of
the settled order of nature

297
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,410
that such a girl
should have followers,

298
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:29,790
but for choice, not on bicycles
in lonely country roads.

299
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,627
You really think she may be
in some danger, Holmes?

300
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,672
Oh, yes.

301
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,425
On the following Monday,

302
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,885
Holmes found that
he had business

303
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,096
which detained him in London,

304
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,808
so, he dispatched me on
the early train to Farnham

305
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,018
that I might observe
Miss Smith's passage

306
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,938
past Charlington Hall.

307
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,984
The setting was
just as she had described,

308
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,070
heavily wooded on the side
bordering the hall,

309
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,031
and utterly
exposed on the other.

310
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:10,539
I selected the only
available cover, and waited.

311
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:56,723
Watson, you have
wasted your time.

312
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:57,641
I thought I did rather well.

313
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,227
No, your hiding place
was ill-chosen.

314
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,186
You should have been
in the bracken

315
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,105
on the other
side of the road.

316
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,107
Then that way you would
have had a close view

317
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,235
of this fascinating
solitary cyclist.

318
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,278
Thank you.

319
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,530
As it is, you were
a hundred yards away

320
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,031
and can tell me even less

321
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,492
than Miss Smith reported to us
last Saturday.

322
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,245
You describe him as bending low
over the handle bar?

323
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,705
Yes, quite low.

324
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,331
Thus concealment again,

325
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,668
which in your case
worked perfectly.

326
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:30,507
Oh know, you really
have done remarkably badly.

327
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,508
He goes back to the Hall

328
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,678
and you come all the way back to
London to call on a house agent.

329
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,847
Well, I found
the information I was seeking.

330
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:37,890
You found the name Williamson,

331
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,308
which conveys
nothing to my mind.

332
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,059
Well, we know he's elderly
and respectable.

333
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,270
And therefore, unlikely to be
the energetic cyclist

334
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,023
that sprints away from
that athletic young girl.

335
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,274
Well, what should I have done?

336
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,026
Gone to the nearest
public house.

337
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,320
That is the center
of country gossip.

338
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,696
They would have
given you every name

339
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,781
from the master
to the scullery maid.

340
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:58,660
Instead of which,
you give me--Williamson.

341
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,465
So, what have we gained
by your expedition.

342
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,342
The fact that
the girl's story is true;

343
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,135
I never doubted that.

344
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,011
That there is a connection

345
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,429
between the cyclist
and the Hall;

346
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,306
I never doubted
that, either.

347
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:24,561
The Hall is tenanted
by a man called Williamson.

348
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,981
Who is the better for that?

349
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,527
I shall go back tomorrow
and visit the public house.

350
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,737
No, my dear sir, do not
commit yourself to rashness

351
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,074
because you are
temporarily depressed.

352
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:40,661
We can do nothing useful
until Saturday.

353
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:48,252
Did I really do
remarkably badly?

354
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

355
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,273
Very beautiful.

356
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,691
Thank you, Mr. Carruthers.

357
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,734
It is a new piece.

358
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,487
I need to
practice it more.

359
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,699
No, I don't mean the music.

360
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:27,291
Violet, I have
a question to ask you.

361
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,506
Morning, Holmes.

362
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,384
A letter
from Miss Violet Smith.

363
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,929
Now Carruthers has proposed
marriage to her.

364
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:41,889
Carruthers!

365
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:45,475
Gentlemen are permitted
to propose marriage, Watson.

366
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,936
Of course he didn't
know about Cyril.

367
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,480
Are you going
to Farnham?

368
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:53,442
I want to test one or two
theories which I have formed.

369
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,651
Shall I come with you?

370
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:59,406
No, that will be neither
useful nor necessary.

371
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,743
Try the nearest public house,

372
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,287
always a good center
for country gossip.

373
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,792
Thank you, Watson,
capital notion!

374
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,284
Ah, Good afternoon, Landlord.

375
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,287
May I have half a pint
of your local ale, please?

376
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,664
Certainly, sir.

377
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,463
Here you are.

378
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,799
Thank you.

379
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:44,428
You may keep the change.

380
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:48,348
That's most generous
of you, sir, but I couldn't.

381
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,434
I haven't done anything
to warrant such generosity.

382
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,311
I'm about to give you
the opportunity.

383
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:53,520
I need some information.

384
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,356
Oh, I'm not one
for idle gossip, sir.

385
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,401
Neither am I,
I prefer facts.

386
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,404
Tell me about the people
at Charlington Hall.

387
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,032
You mean
Mr. Williamson, sir?

388
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,158
Yes.

389
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,785
Well, he--he was in here
not more than five minutes ago.

390
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:09,995
You just missed him.

391
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,079
Tell me about Mr. Williamson.

392
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,290
Is he an elderly,
respectable gentleman?

393
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,918
Oh, he's elderly,
no doubt.

394
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,879
Far be it from me to speak ill
of people behind their backs,

395
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,923
but I'm none too sure
about respectable.

396
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:21,882
Really?

397
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,636
He is an ex-clergymen,
I reckon.

398
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:26,887
Ex?

399
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,055
Apparently.

400
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,224
He was struck off,

401
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,392
or whatever it is
happens to clergymen.

402
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,270
That's doctors
that are struck off.

403
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:38,273
Tell me about the other people
up at the house.

404
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,734
Well, they're
just domestic staff,

405
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,861
and they're all
local and God-fearing.

406
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:45,072
Of course.

407
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,992
He do have folk up there
at weekends.

408
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:52,788
Weekends?

409
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,083
Yes, sir.

410
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,544
Weekends.

411
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:01,755
Ah, no problem.
What sort of folk?

412
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,298
Oh, they're a warm lot.

413
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,299
Warm?

414
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,969
Yes, the sort you
don't want to get too near

415
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,763
for fear of getting
burnt like.

416
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,765
That's good.

417
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,102
Oh, you may
think it's good, sir.

418
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,272
They don't come down well
in the village, I can tell you.

419
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:21,024
There was one fellow
in particular.

420
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,360
Particularly warm,
is he, this fellow?

421
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,488
He is very particularly, sir.

422
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,616
I'll wager he has
a red mustache.

423
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,786
Hey, do you know him?

424
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,872
I never met the gentleman.

425
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,291
Well, now is your chance.

426
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,254
Mr. Woodley.

427
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:45,507
None of your damn business!

428
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,801
Our Landlord keeps
a very respectable house,

429
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,469
and your language
is not welcome.

430
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:50,554
Who do you think you are?

431
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,057
What the hell do you want coming
here asking all them questions?

432
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,810
You're quite right, Landlord,
clearly not a gentleman.

433
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,188
Oh, I'm as much a gentleman
as you are.

434
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,865
Everybody here will
bear witness to the fact

435
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,577
that I am acting
in self-defense.

436
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,055
Swine!

437
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,890
No, sir,
a gentleman!

438
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,643
Only a ruffian deals a blow
with the back of a hand.

439
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,355
A gentleman uses
the straight--left...

440
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,732
and I, sir,
am a gentleman!

441
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:30,904
It was absolutely
delicious, Watson.

442
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,531
So I see.

443
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:37,077
A straight left
against a slogging ruffian.

444
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,205
I emerged, as you see.

445
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,791
And the slogging ruffian?

446
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:47,546
Mr. Woodley was taken home
in a cart.

447
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:00,142
There's that
horrible man again.

448
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,522
Which man?

449
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:38,847
I thought I saw Mr. Woodley
in the garden today.

450
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,309
You did.
He's staying in the area.

451
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,604
But do not worry,
I have told him quite firmly

452
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,274
he's not to set foot
inside the house.

453
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,152
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

454
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,279
You will not be
surprised to learn

455
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,740
that I will be leaving
Mr. Carruthers's employment

456
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,159
on Saturday."

457
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:06,333
The odious Mr. Woodley has
reappeared at Chiltern Grange.

458
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,546
Ah, but at least she won't be
bicycling to the station.

459
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:14,675
So finally,
the rich Mr. Carruthers

460
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,343
has acquired
a horse and trap.

461
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,386
Yes.

462
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:22,808
Look here, "all my troubles
will be over on Saturday."

463
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,813
Tomorrow, Holmes,
all her troubles will be over.

464
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,524
Why do I
worry about that word.

465
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,359
Which word?

466
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,903
"Trap."

467
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:45,724
Oh, what a splendid morning,
Holmes!

468
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,559
It's acceptable weather
for the time of year.

469
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,437
Now who would want to harm that
dear girl on such a morning?

470
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:51,980
I hope nobody.

471
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,774
So why did you
bring your revolver?

472
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:58,278
I'm talking about my hope,
not my expec-tations.

473
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,823
What?

474
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:07,913
I fancy that
is our Miss Smith.

475
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,499
She must be traveling
by an earlier train.

476
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:12,125
I give her a margin
of half an hour,

477
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,752
but she'll be
past Charlington Hall

478
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,213
before we can
possibly meet her.

479
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,465
So what can we do?

480
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,468
We could run.

481
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:30,227
Fool, I should have allowed
for that earlier train!

482
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,963
It's abduction,

483
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:02,259
Watson, it's abduction,
murder, heaven knows what.

484
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,846
Stop that horse.

485
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,403
Good man.

486
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:24,406
Come on, Watson!

487
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,952
Let's see if I can repair the
consequences of my own blunder!

488
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,322
Up there!

489
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,101
Holmes.

490
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,270
Where did you get that cart?!

491
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,730
Where is Miss Violet Smith?!

492
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:42,609
That's what I'm asking you.
You were in her cart!

493
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,445
It was on the road,
there was no one in it!

494
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:50,159
Somebody seems to have
gone through this way!

495
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,873
We must find them!

496
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,542
Come, Watson.

497
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:07,217
Now look,
do you know who this is?!

498
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,343
That's Peter, the groom,

499
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,179
he was taking her
to the station.

500
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,306
He's alive,
his pulse is strong.

501
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,765
Mustn't be left
lying there too long.

502
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,475
Let him lie,
we can't do him any good,

503
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,269
but we might save her
from the worst fate

504
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,979
that can befall a woman.

505
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,647
Where are you going?!

506
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:21,607
The house!

507
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,983
They didn't go
to the house!

508
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,028
They went this way
to the left.

509
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:26,945
Are you sure?

510
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,782
Oh, cowardly dogs!

511
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:31,533
Too late!

512
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:32,326
Watson.

513
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:37,331
Too late by the living Jingo!

514
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,431
For as much
as John and Violet

515
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:58,477
have consented together
in holy wedlock,

516
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:05,359
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

517
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,031
and have declared the same

518
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,700
by the giving
and receiving of a ring,

519
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,620
and the joining of hands,

520
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:24,378
I pronounce that
they be man and wife, together.

521
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,965
Congratulations!

522
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,385
Thanks, amen.

523
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,595
They're married!

524
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:39,393
Welcome to the party,
gentlemen.

525
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:44,106
Let me introduce you
to Mrs. Woodley.

526
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,900
Don't Carruthers!

527
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,986
Carruthers!

528
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,663
Yes, and I'll see
this woman righted,

529
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,498
if I have to swing for it.

530
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:02,624
You're too late.

531
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,543
She is my wife!

532
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:08,422
No, she's your widow.

533
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,133
I told you what I'd do
if you molested her!

534
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:14,094
By the Lord,
I'm a man of my word!

535
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,098
When you hired me,

536
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:22,060
nobody told me there'd be
any of this damn nonsense!

537
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,562
Drop that pistol.

538
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:26,356
Watson, pick it up!

539
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,652
Give me that revolver,
we'll have no more violence.

540
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,112
Who are you
to be giving these orders?

541
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,573
Sherlock Holmes.

542
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:35,949
Good Lord.

543
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,952
Here, you!

544
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:40,746
Sir?

545
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,414
Are you well enough
to drive into Farnham?

546
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,958
Yes, sir,
I reckon I am.

547
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:45,626
Then give this note

548
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:50,506
to the superintendent
of the police station.

549
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:51,298
In the meantime,

550
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:55,969
I must detain you all under
my own personal custody.

551
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,168
How are the patients, Doctor?

552
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,212
Miss Smith's very well,

553
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,674
considering the foul way
she's been treated.

554
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,133
And Woodley?

555
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,845
Alas, I have no doubt
he will live.

556
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:39,972
What, I'll go upstairs
and finish him off.

557
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:43,350
No, sit down in that chair,
Carruthers.

558
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,226
You're right.

559
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,228
He isn't worth
swinging for.

560
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,145
But do you tell me
that girl

561
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,523
is to be tied to
Roaring Jack Woodley for life?!

562
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,066
You needn't concern
yourself about that.

563
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,402
I married them
till death do them part.

564
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:58,907
Under no circumstances can she
be considered his wife.

565
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,492
Are you sure?

566
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,704
For two very good reasons.

567
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:04,371
In the first place,

568
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:07,541
we are very safe in questioning
Mr. Williamson's right

569
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,084
to solemnize a marriage.

570
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,752
I have been ordained.

571
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,171
And unfrocked.

572
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,382
Once a clergyman,
always a clergyman.

573
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:20,345
I think not.

574
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,806
How about the license?

575
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:26,518
Oh, we had a license.

576
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:29,521
I have it here.

577
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,857
Undoubtedly obtained
by a trick.

578
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,568
But, in any case, a forced
marriage is no marriage,

579
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:38,071
indeed, it is a very serious
felony, as you will discover.

580
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:43,535
Now, while we are waiting
for the police, Mr. Carruthers,

581
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,122
you might tell me
your story.

582
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:51,335
If you squeal on us,
Bob Carruthers,

583
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,880
I'll serve you
as you served Jack Woodley!

584
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,548
There's no need for you
to get over-excited.

585
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,009
The case is clear enough.

586
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:05,057
Well, if it's clear enough,
why don't you tell us.

587
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:06,725
Very well.

588
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,102
Mr. Carruthers will have
to fill in a few details

589
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:11,104
for my private curiosity,

590
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:14,858
but I am happy
to do the talking.

591
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:15,609
In the first place,

592
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,861
the three of you came across
from South Africa.

593
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:21,281
Wrong, I've never even been
in South Africa!

594
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:25,452
It's true.

595
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:32,000
Woodley acquired this creature
after our return.

596
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,585
Very well,
you and Woodley

597
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,130
had known Ralph Smith
in South Africa.

598
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:40,008
You had reason to believe
that he would not live long,

599
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:44,638
and you found out that his niece
would inherit his fortune.

600
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:45,722
How's that?

601
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:48,559
But you told the girl
her uncle died in poverty.

602
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:52,187
Well, as he was still alive,
admittedly only just,

603
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:56,567
and a wealthy man who
I suspect had made no will.

604
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:59,945
Ralph Smith
could neither read nor write.

605
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:05,325
So, you and Woodley came over
here and hunted up the girl,

606
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,412
knowing she was
the next of kin,

607
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,539
and that you would
share the plunder.

608
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:14,710
I was due a share
for services rendered.

609
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:17,045
And Carruthers,

610
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:25,345
you made the mistake
of falling in love with her.

611
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,891
The first time that ever I knew
what love was, Mr. Holmes.

612
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:34,271
Why didn't you tell her
of the danger she was in?

613
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:43,739
Because--because
she would have left me,

614
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:49,745
and I couldn't bear
to face that.

615
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:57,127
Oh, what will happen
to my daughter, Sarah?

616
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:01,256
We'll see she's
well taken care of.

617
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:10,724
You see, even if
she couldn't love me,

618
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,852
it meant a great deal
to see her about the house

619
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:18,190
and hear the sound
of her voice.

620
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:21,860
You may call it love,
Mr. Carruthers,

621
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:24,905
I should call it
selfishness.

622
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:31,078
Maybe the two things
go together.

623
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,579
But I tried to protect her,

624
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,039
I never once let her go
past this house

625
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,916
where I knew those rascals
were lurking

626
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,626
without following her
on my bicycle

627
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,587
to see she
came to no harm.

628
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:43,632
I kept my distance
and wore that beard

629
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:46,218
so she should not
recognize me.

630
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,055
Then I presume
the cable arrived?

631
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:53,600
Cable, what cable?

632
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,196
"THE OLD MAN IS DEAD."

633
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,740
What old man?

634
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:12,035
I imagine Ralph Smith
in South Africa.

635
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:13,203
Yes.

636
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,038
But by this time you and Woodley
had quarreled

637
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:16,707
and he had left the house.

638
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:20,836
Woodley came back again to ask
me to stick to the bargain.

639
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,588
I refused.

640
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,674
I said I would have
nothing to do with violence.

641
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:34,057
One last detail,

642
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:39,897
why was Woodley chosen
as the prospective husband?

643
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:46,028
I am ashamed to say it...

644
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:52,826
we played cards for her.

645
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:29,696
Holmes, I have the results
of the trial.

646
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:35,494
Listen to this, the judge
in summing up said--

647
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,164
Holmes.

648
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:43,544
Watson, may I be permitted
an educated guess?

649
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,381
Go on then.

650
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,925
I would expect Woodley
to get ten years,

651
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,010
Williamson seven years,

652
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:53,720
and Carruthers,

653
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:57,933
in view of the eloquent speech I
made on his behalf at the trial,

654
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,893
probably six months.

655
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:05,691
That is exactly right!

656
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,569
Well, I have
certain advantages, Watson,

657
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:13,115
largely the fact that I sent out
for the early edition.

658
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,243
An undoubted advantage.

659
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:18,078
Also, we have received
a present,

660
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:22,124
some wedding cake from
Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Morton,

661
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,083
together with a letter

662
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,753
telling us that Mrs. Morton has
inherited a large sum of money

663
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:31,216
from her uncle, Ralph Smith,
formerly of South Africa.

664
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,676
The happy couple
are thoroughly enjoying

665
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,137
looking after young
Sarah Carruthers,

666
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:38,140
while her father
is in custody.

667
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,100
Her piano playing
is improving

668
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:43,604
and she wants to
take up bicycling.

669
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:47,733
A splendid day all round,
wouldn't you say?

670
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,027
There is more splendor
yet to come.

671
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:52,362
More splendor,
what do you mean?

672
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,284
Watch carefully.

673
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,953
Oh, I remember,

674
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:01,705
the chemical reaction
that will solve the mystery

675
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,750
concerning the persecution
of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

676
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:05,459
Precisely.

677
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:08,045
I've spent the entire week
in the lmperial Science Museum

678
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,342
and I think
this is the answer.

679
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,668
Is that the answer, Holmes?

680
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,505
Yes, that is the answer,
Watson.

681
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,715
Well, let me think.
