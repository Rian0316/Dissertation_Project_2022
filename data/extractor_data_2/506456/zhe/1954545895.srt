华生      干嘛?
Watson.        Yes.

5
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,445
来看
Watch.

6
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,420
你即将目睹的化学反应
The chemical reaction you are about to witness

7
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:55,800
会解决约翰・文森特・哈登先生

8
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,469
的迫害事件中的疑点
of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

9
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,887
太好了
Excellent,

10
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,889
那位烟草富翁 我该记笔记吗?
the tobacco millionaire, shall I take notes?

11
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,718
不用 时间宽裕之时我会复述
No, I will dictate in the fullness of time.

12
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,734
有位年轻女士想见你 福尔摩斯先生
There's a young lady wishes to see you, Mr. Holmes.

13
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,821
我现在不方便见客!
This is not a convenient moment!

14
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,874
她是位谈吐得体 货真价实的淑女
She's very well spoken, a genuine lady.

15
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,334
毫无疑问
No doubt.

16
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:24,112
并且坚持不懈
And persistent, too.

17
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,498
赫德森太太 我也是个坚持不懈的人
Mrs. Hudson, I, too, am extremely persistent,

18
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,208
尤其在工作的时候
especially when I'm working.

19
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,420
是紧急事件 福尔摩斯先生
It is a matter of great urgency, Mr. Holmes,

20
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,048
否则我也不会在星期六晚上打扰你
or I would not be troubling you on a Saturday evening.

21
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,002
或许你该...
Perhaps you could, uh, 

22
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,411
稍后再做化学反应 福尔摩斯
delay your chemical reaction, Holmes.

23
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,700
好吧
Very well.

24
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,190
请坐 怎么称呼?
Do sit down, Miss, uh?

25
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,649
维尔莉特・史密斯
Violet Smith.

26
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:55,985
华生医生
Dr. Watson.

27
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,530
谢谢 赫德森太太
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

28
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,950
正如我说 一位货真价实的淑女
A genuine lady, I told you.

29
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,000
噢 请坐
Oh, please.

30
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,958
呃 谢谢 我坐那里就可以了
Um, thank you, I'll be quite happy here.

31
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:16,047
好了 史密斯小姐
Very well, Miss Smith,

32
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,716
你得将你的紧急事件告诉我们
you must tell us your matter of great urgency.

33
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,635
这肯定与你的健康无关
It is obviously not your health.

34
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,096
你热衷于骑车 所以肯定充满活力
So ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.

35
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,973
是的 我经常骑自行车
Yes, I bicycle a good deal.

36
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,935
鞋底边缘的轻微起毛
Slight roughening on the side of the soles

37
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,479
是与踏板摩擦造成的
caused by the friction of the pedals.

38
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,606
棒极了 华生
Excellent, Watson.

39
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,025
你鞋子上的痕迹
The marks on your shoes.

40
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,277
哦 是的!
Oh, yes!

41
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:40,387
即便是去很远的地方
Even if I have to travel a long way,

42
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,970
我也会像今天一样将单车带上火车
I take my bicycle on the train with me as I did today.

43
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,069
请原谅 但这是我的工作
You will excuse me, but it is my business.

44
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:48,944
果然 我差点犯了个错误
Yes, I nearly fell into the error

45
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,504
以为你是靠打字维生
of supposing you earned a living by typewriting,

46
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,459
但很明显你靠音乐维生
but of course, it is obviously music.

47
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,713
华生 看看勺状的指尖
You will observe, Watson, the spatulate finger ends,

48
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,225
都是两种职业常见的
which is common to both professions.

49
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,346
但她脸上有股灵性
There is a spirituality about the face, however,

50
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,431
打字员所不具备的
which the typewriter does not generate.

51
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,976
这位女士是音乐家
This lady is a musician.

52
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,312
是的 福尔摩斯先生 我教音乐!
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music!

53
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,607
从你的脸色推测 你是在乡村教
In the country, I presume, from your complexion.

54
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,111
在法恩罕附近 萨里的边界!
Near Farnham on the borders of Surrey!

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,493
请容我解释拜访的原因
But please, let me explain why I am here.

56
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:36,502
我是独女 父亲在几年前去世了
I am an only child, and my father died some years ago.

57
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,754
他的名字和职业?
His name and profession?

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,047
詹姆斯・史密斯
James Smith,

59
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,301
他是旧皇家音乐厅的乐队指挥
he conducted the orchestra at the old Imperial Theater.

60
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,846
啊 旧音乐厅 福尔摩斯
Ah, the old Imperial, Holmes.

61
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,389
是的
Yes.

62
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,808
请继续
Please continue.

63
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,398
我和母亲举目无亲
My mother and I were left without a relation in the world

64
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,151
只有一个叔叔 拉夫・史密斯 
except for one uncle, Ralph Smith,

65
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,571
15年前去了非洲
who went to Africa 15 years ago,

66
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,573
之后便杳无音信
and we have not had a word from him since,

67
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,993
尽管我们寄过圣诞卡和照片
despite our Christmas cards and photographs.

68
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,956
福尔摩斯先生 我得告诉你...
Mr. Holmes, I have to tell you that-

69
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,667
我猜你想告诉我
I think you wish to tell me

70
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,545
你和你母亲一贫如洗
that you and your mother are very poor,

71
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,591
却无法掩盖你的优雅 端庄和才华
not withstanding your obvious grace, dignity and talent.

72
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,593
我们曾经很穷
We were very poor.

73
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,719
啊?
Ah.

74
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,435
大约4个月前 在二月份
About four months ago, in February,

75
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,977
我们得知《泰晤士报》上有则寻人启事
we were told there was an advertisement in the Times,

76
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,856
询问我们的下落
inquiring for our whereabouts.

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,025
你能想象我们有多激动
You can imagine how excited we were,

78
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,819
以为有人给我们留了笔财产
for we thought that someone had left us a fortune.

79
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,613
我立即去找了
I went at once to the lawyers

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,074
报上所登的律师
whose name was given in the paper.

81
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,413
这位是维尔莉特・史密斯
Now, this is Miss Violet Smith.

82
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,000
律师给我引见了两位先生
The solicitor introduced me to two men,

83
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,420
卡拉瑟斯先生和伍德利先生
a Mr. Carruthers and a Mr. Woodley.

84
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,674
他们自南非回来拜访
They were on a visit from South Africa.

85
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,852
我希望能告诉你
I wish I could tell you 

86
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,235
你叔叔给你留下一大笔遗产
your uncle left you a vast fortune,

87
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,188
但正如我所说...
but as I said...

88
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,483
他死时贫困交加
He died in extreme poverty.

89
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:27,864
然而 我不是空手而来
However, I myself am not without means.

90
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,120
我和母亲从未寻求施舍
My mother and I never sought charity.

91
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,374
不 我不是想施舍你们
No, nor do I offer it.

92
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,628
请坐
Please.

93
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,009
我想问你一个问题
I have a question to ask of you.

94
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,053
你叔叔拉夫说你喜爱音乐
Your Uncle Ralph said you were very musical,

95
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,222
你教音乐吗?
Do you teach music?

96
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,849
是的
Yes.

97
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,336
史密斯小姐 我是鳏夫
Miss Smith, I am now a widower

98
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:59,111
有个10岁的女儿
with a 10-year-old daughter.

99
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,771
小莎拉
Young Sarah.

100
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,277
她需要位音乐老师
She needs a music teacher.

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,654
因此 我不是来施舍你们的
So, you see, I do not offer charity.

102
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,450
工作 他想给你份工作!
A job, he wants to give you a job!

103
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:19,290
你住在伦敦的哪里 卡拉瑟斯先生?
Whereabouts in London do you live, Mr. Carruthers?

104
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,501
我不住伦敦
I don't.

105
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,922
我住在离法恩罕约6英里的萨里
I live about six miles from Farnham, in Surrey,

106
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,049
的奇尔顿农庄里
at Chiltern Grange.

107
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,635
我不能让母亲独居
I couldn't possibly leave my mother on her own.

108
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,597
我每年付你100镑薪水
I will pay you 100 pounds a year.

109
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,726
每年100镑?
A hundred a year?

110
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,936
是的
Yes.

111
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,438
我想大约是市价的两倍
Approximately double the market price, I think.

112
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,190
噢 不止!
Oh, at least!

113
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:49,362
你接受了 否则现在你不会在这里
Which you obviously accepted, or you wouldn't be here now.

114
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,446
是的
Yes.

115
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,406
我接受了这份工作
I accepted the offer.

116
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,166
卡拉瑟斯先生同意
Mr. Carruthers agreed

117
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,911
我每逢周末回城探望母亲
that I should go home every weekend to my mother in town.

118
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,330
那现在是你回伦敦的周末之一?
So this is one of your weekend visits to London?

119
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,524
没错
It is.

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,378
谈谈你在奇尔顿农庄的生活
Tell me about your life at Chiltern Grange.

121
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,843
刚开始 一切都很完美
For a while, it was quite perfect.

122
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:16,180
每个星期一早晨我搭火车到法恩罕
Every Monday morning I would take the train to Farnham

123
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,226
然后从车站骑车到农庄
and then bicycle from the station to the house.

124
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,585
小女孩名叫莎拉
The little girl's name was Sarah,

125
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,087
她让人非常愉快
and she was delightful,

126
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,308
也是位好学生
as well as being a very good pupil.

127
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,804
有很大进步 莎拉
That was very much better, Sarah.

128
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,598
我能再弹一次吗?
May I try it again?

129
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,976
当然 我们坐在这正是为了如此
Of course, that's why we're here.

130
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,733
卡拉瑟斯先生对我的工作很满意
Mr. Carruthers was appreciative of my work,

131
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,737
而且是位友好周到的主人
and an extremely kind and considerate host.

132
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,413
听起来很美好
Sounds idyllic.

133
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,950
是的
It was.

134
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,672
是什么破坏了这份美好?
What happened to spoil it?

135
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,465
一位访客
A visitor.

136
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,292
伍德利先生
Mr. Woodley.

137
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,462
你怎么猜到的 福尔摩斯先生?
However did you guess, Mr. Holmes?

138
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,667
史密斯小姐 我从不猜测
Miss Smith, I never guess.

139
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,804
谈谈他的来访
Tell me about his visit.

140
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,017
他过来呆一个星期
He arrived and was to stay for a week.

141
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,523
对我来说如同三秋
But to me it seemed like three months.

142
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,094
那可恨的红胡子!
Oh, that odious red mustache!

143
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,871
一天晚饭后
One evening after dinner,

144
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,123
卡拉瑟斯先生要离席片刻
Mr. Carruthers had to leave us for a minute

145
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,978
去门外见一位访客
to see somebody at the door.

146
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,346
有位绅士想见你 先生
A gentleman to see you, sir.

147
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,995
失陪一下
Will you excuse me?

148
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,223
这下可好多了
That's better.

149
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,135
什么好多了?
Better, in what way?

150
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,274
没有老头在这碍手碍脚
It's better to get the old folk out of the way.

151
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,227
我不认为卡拉瑟斯先生老
I don't regard Mr. Carruthers as old.

152
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,447
是啊 但也不如我俩
Oh, yes, but he isn't young...

153
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,240
那般年轻
like us.

154
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,766
我希望你别对着我喷烟 伍德利先生
I do wish you wouldn't blow smoke in my face, Mr. Woodley.

155
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,766
我可不信
Oh, I don't believe that for a moment.

156
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,670
不信什么?
What don't you believe?

157
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,753
当女人说不希望你做什么
When women say they wish you wouldn't do something,

158
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,297
她们通常表里不一
it generally means the exact opposite.

159
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,925
我没有表里不一!
I mean precisely what I say!

160
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,761
伍德利先生 你能不能别烦我?
Mr. Woodley, will you please leave me alone!

161
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,054
不
No.

162
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,640
实话和你说 我会烦着你
To tell you the truth, I won't leave you alone,

163
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,435
直到我说出真心话
not until I've said what's in my heart.

164
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,853
什么意思?
Whatever do you mean?

165
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,855
我不懂繁文缛节
I'm not very well up on the social graces,

166
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,819
但我愿意学 只要你愿意教我
but I'm prepared to learn, if you're prepared to teach me.

167
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,822
这真荒谬!
Oh, this is absurd!

168
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,451
一点也不荒谬 我在跟你求婚!
It isn't absurd! I'm asking you to marry me!

169
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,330
我是诚心诚意的
I mean it, it's from the heart.

170
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,873
钱不是问题
Money isn't a problem,

171
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,626
我在南非混得很好
I did very well out in South Africa.

172
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,295
我可以给你更好的生活
Whatever you are accustomed to, I can give you better,

173
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,214
比你现在的要好
better that you're accustomed to;

174
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,668
珠宝 钻石
jewelry, diamonds.

175
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:25,555
如果你想要钻石 我可以给你钻石
You want diamonds, oh, I can give you diamonds.

176
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,766
我不要钻石!
I don't want diamonds!

177
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,186
好好考虑一下 我不会催你
Oh, you think about it. I won't rush you.

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,257
我已经考虑过了
I've thought about it,

179
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,193
这个想法太可笑了
and the idea is ludicrous.

180
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,572
你不能责怪我的争取!
Well, you can't blame me for trying!

181
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,324
你非常美
You're very beautiful.

182
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,662
为了消除芥蒂
Listen, just to show there are no hard feelings,

183
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,206
让我亲一下吧
what about a little kiss to be going on with, hmm,

184
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,908
就在脸颊轻吻一下
just a peck on the cheek.

185
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,676
伍德利先生 请你住手!
Mr. Woodley, will you please stop it!

186
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:57,670
我说过女人表里不一
Oh, I told you before about women who say stop it.

187
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,254
不!
No!

188
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,506
越挣扎 越有趣
The more they struggle, the more fun it is.

189
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,201
卡拉瑟斯先生 让他住手!
Mr. Carruthers, will you stop him!

190
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,103
滚出我家!
Get out of this house!

191
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,571
好啊!
All right!

192
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,732
我走
I'm going.

193
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,000
我对老头可没有兴趣
I'm not interested in old men,

194
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,114
还有老处女!
and old maids!

195
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,308
我对刚刚发生的一切
I can only offer you my most sincere apologies

196
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,126
表示深深的歉意
for what has happened.

197
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,558
如果我向你保证这种事再不会发生
If I give you my assurance that it will not happen again,

198
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:57,642
你能为了我女儿留下来吗?
for my daughter's sake, will you stay?

199
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,871
是的 我会留下来
Yes, I will stay.

200
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,242
谢谢 维尔莉特
Thank you, Violet.

201
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,424
自此之后我再没见过伍德利先生
Mr. Woodley left the house and I have not seen him since.

202
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,444
无赖!
The blackguard!

203
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,058
卡拉瑟斯先生的举止
Has there been any change

204
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,010
有什么改变吗?
in the behavior of Mr. Carruthers?

205
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:45,611
没有 他一如既往 周到而彬彬有礼
No, he continues to be polite and considerate and courteous.

206
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,281
史密斯小姐 请继续说
Now, Miss Smith, please, please continue.

207
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,786
的确 还有一件事
Yes, there is something else.

208
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,107
也许是我多心
Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine,

209
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,170
但似乎卡拉瑟斯先生
but it seems to me that Mr. Carruthers

210
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,297
对我有意思
shows a great deal of interest in me.

211
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:09,068
他什么也没说 他是位很好的绅士
Oh, he has never said anything, he is a perfect gentleman,

212
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,764
但一个姑娘心里总明白
but, a girl always knows.

213
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,989
我相信
So I believe.

214
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,059
而我推定
And I assume

215
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,604
你对此没有予以任何
that these feelings that you sense from Mr. Carruthers

216
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,773
感情上的回报吧?
are not reciprocated?

217
00:16:23,176 --> 00:16:27,236
他是位友好慷慨的雇主
He is a kind and generous employer,

218
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,563
但我已经订婚了
but I am already engaged.

219
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:33,492
这位幸运的男士是谁?
Oh, the name of this very fortunate young man is?!

220
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,900
西里尔・莫尔顿
Cyril Morton.

221
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,047
他是位电气工程师
He's an electrical engineer

222
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:41,652
在考文垂的米德兰电气公司工作
with the Midland Electric Company in Coventry.

223
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,738
我们要在夏末结婚
We're to be married at the end of the summer.

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,933
祝你幸福
We wish you joy.

225
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,885
谢谢
Thank you.

226
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,305
然而我很困惑你为什么会来找我
Yet, I am puzzled as to why you have chosen to consult me.

227
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,978
你说的事的确引人入胜
It is an intriguing story, to be sure,

228
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:02,188
但我感觉到你的恐惧 却不知其因
but I sense you are frightened, and do not understand why.

229
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,107
你看来有足够的自我保护能力
You seem well capable of protecting yourself.

230
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:11,000
求求你 帮帮我 福尔摩斯先生!
Please, help me, Mr. Holmes!

231
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,920
怎么了?
What is it?

232
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,182
我被跟踪了
I am being followed.

233
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:28,589
被谁跟踪?
Followed, by whom?

234
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,552
一个骑单车的人
A cyclist.

235
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,470
每个星期六早晨
Every Saturday morning

236
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,348
我从农庄骑车到法恩罕车站
I bicycle from the house to Farnham Station

237
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,518
搭12点22分的火车进城
to catch the 12:22 to town.

238
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,897
有段路程人烟稀少
There is one very quiet and lonely stretch of road

239
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,150
路的一旁是查灵顿石南丛
that lies between Charlington Heath on the one hand

240
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,153
另一旁是查灵顿庄园树林
and the woods of Charlington Hall on the other.

241
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,574
两周前的今天 我经过那条路
Two weeks ago today, I was passing this place

242
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:59,787
偶然回头时 见到一个男人
when I chanced to look back and saw a man,

243
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,151
也骑着自行车
also on a bicycle.

244
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,380
之后星期一回去时也见到他
The following Monday when I returned he was there again.

245
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,007
我明白了
I see.

246
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:15,219
上个星期六和星期一同样如此
And again last Saturday, and again last Monday.

247
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,587
你有跟你的雇主提过吗?
Have you mentioned this to your employer?

248
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,015
提过
Yes.

249
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,392
卡拉瑟斯先生非常担心
Mr. Carruthers was very concerned,

250
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,360
并订购了马和轻便马车
and has ordered a horse and trap

251
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,106
这样我就不必独自上路
so that in the future I should not travel unaccompanied.

252
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,150
但他们还没到
But they've not yet arrived.

253
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,845
今天早上呢?
And this morning?

254
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,572
他又跟踪我了
He was following me again.

255
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,957
我减速 他也减速
I slowed down, but he did the same.

256
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:51,088
我停车 他也停车
Then I stopped completely, but he did the same.

257
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:56,252
因此我心生一计来对付他
So, I laid a trap for him.

258
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,152
这条路上有处急转弯
There is a sharp turning of the road,

259
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,196
我快速转弯
and I pedaled very quickly towards this

260
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,865
然后停车等着
and then stopped and waited.

261
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,166
但他就这么凭空消失了
But he seemed to disappear into thin air.

262
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,436
你能形容一下这名男子吗?
Can you describe this man?

263
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,158
我知道你只远远见过他
I realize that you've only seen him from a distance.

264
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:33,389
是的
Yes.

265
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,844
他穿着深色外衣 戴着深色眼镜
He wears a dark suit, dark spectacles,

266
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,345
蓄着络腮胡
and he has a beard.

267
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,013
年不年轻?
Young, old?

268
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,684
大概是中年人
He's about middle-aged.

269
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,145
看看我有没有弄错地形
Now, let me see if I have the geography correct.

270
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:52,976
这是条路 这边有个急弯
Here is the road, with a sharp bend in it here.

271
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,529
这边是查灵顿石南丛
On this side, Charlington Heath,

272
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,532
另一边是查灵顿庄园树林
and on the other, the woods of Charlington Hall.

273
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,868
你在弯道等了他多久?
How long did you wait for him here around the bend?

274
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,411
不超过2分钟
Oh, no more than two minutes.

275
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,164
因此他不可能原路返回
So he could not have retreated back down the road.

276
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,707
周围有岔路吗?
Are there any side roads?

277
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,792
这段路没有
None along this stretch.

278
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,378
会不会是往石南丛小路走了?
Could he have taken a footpath across the heath?

279
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,006
石南丛十分平整荒芜
Oh, the heath is totally flat and bleak.

280
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,258
我想如果那样我能看到他
I think I would have noticed him.

281
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,885
因此 根据排除推理法
So, by a process of exclusion,

282
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,930
得出结论 他走进了
we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards

283
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,764
查灵顿庄园树林
Charlington Hall.

284
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,475
卡拉瑟斯先生如何谋生?
Now how does Mr. Carruthers make his living?

285
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,795
他非常富有
Oh, he's a rich man.

286
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,739
但却没有马车或马
But no carriages or horses.

287
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,859
但起码他非常富裕
Well, at least he's very well off.

288
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,404
他每周进城两三次
He goes into the city two or three times a week,

289
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,700
有时会提起他的金矿股票
and he sometimes refers to his gold shares.

290
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,784
我明白了
Yes, I see.

291
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,248
你必须马上告诉我
You must let me know immediately

292
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,497
任何新发现的情况
if there are any fresh developments.

293
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,499
眼下我非常忙
I am extremely busy just now,

294
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,252
但我会抽空调查你的案子
but I will find time to make inquiries into your case.

295
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,129
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

296
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,717
与此同时 不要没通知我就采取行动
In the meantime, take no step without letting me know.

297
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,976
我相信我们会给你带来好消息的
I'm sure we shall have nothing but good news for you.

298
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,572
希望如此 华生医生
I do hope so, Dr. Watson.

299
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
非常可爱的女孩
Very lovely girl.

300
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,448
是的
Yes.

301
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,700
根据自然规律
And it is part of the settled order of nature

302
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,410
这样的女孩应该不乏追求者
that such a girl should have followers,

303
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,790
不过没人会选荒僻村路骑车追求
but for choice, not on bicycles in lonely country roads.

304
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,527
你真认为她身处险境吗 福尔摩斯?
You really think she may be in some danger, Holmes?

305
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,672
是的
Oh, yes.

306
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,425
接下来的星期一
On the following Monday,

307
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,010
福尔摩斯因为工作
Holmes found that he had business

308
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,996
而逗留伦敦
which detained him in London,

309
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,808
因此他派我搭早班车前往法恩罕
so, he dispatched me on the early train to Farnham

310
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,143
以便观察史密斯小姐
that I might observe Miss Smith's passage

311
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,838
经过查灵顿庄园所走的路
past Charlington Hall.

312
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,984
那里正如她所描述的一般
The setting was just as she had described,

313
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,070
庄园被茂密的树林环绕
heavily wooded on the side bordering the hall,

314
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,031
路的另一边则一片荒芜
and utterly exposed on the other.

315
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:10,072
我选好唯一的藏身处 等待着
I selected the only available cover, and waited.

316
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,723
华生 你在浪费时间
Watson, you have wasted your time.

317
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,019
我以为我做得很好
I thought I did rather well.

318
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,227
不 你的藏身处选得很糟糕
No, your hiding place was ill-chosen.

319
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,359
你应该藏在
You should have been in the bracken

320
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,110
路另一边的灌木丛中
on the other side of the road.

321
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,407
那样就可以近距离观察
Then that way you would have had a close view

322
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,235
那位迷人的孤身骑车人
of this fascinating solitary cyclist.

323
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,278
谢谢
Thank you.

324
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,530
而你却藏在100码之外
As it is, you were a hundred yards away

325
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,031
能告诉我的情况甚至比
and can tell me even less

326
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,492
上周六史密斯小姐说的还少
than Miss Smith reported to us last Saturday.

327
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,245
你说他伏身在车把上?
You describe him as bending low over the handle bar?

328
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,805
是的 低伏着
Yes, quite low.

329
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:22,331
又是为了隐藏面目
Thus concealment again,

330
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,668
对藏那么远的你来说很有效
which in your case worked perfectly.

331
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,507
你做得非常糟糕
Oh know, you really have done remarkably badly.

332
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,808
他走进庄园
He goes back to the Hall

333
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,618
你却一路跑回伦敦
and you come all the way back to London

334
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:35,618
去找房屋经纪人
to call on a house agent.

335
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,847
我查到了想要的信息
Well, I found the information I was seeking.

336
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,273
你找到个叫威廉森的名字
You found the name Williamson,

337
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:40,308
对我来说毫无用处
which conveys nothing to my mind.

338
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,059
我们得知他年老以及正派
Well, we know he's elderly and respectable.

339
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,270
因此 不可能是那位精力充沛
And therefore, unlikely to be the energetic cyclist

340
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,023
能快速逃开矫健年轻女孩的骑车人
that sprints away from that athletic young girl.

341
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,399
那我该怎么做?
Well, what should I have done?

342
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,026
去最近的小酒馆
Gone to the nearest public house.

343
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,320
那儿是乡村流言蜚语的中心
That is the center of country gossip.

344
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,696
他们会告诉你庄园内
They would have given you every name

345
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,781
从主人到帮厨女佣的名字
from the master to the scullery maid.

346
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:59,660
而不是你告诉我的...威廉森
Instead of which, you give me-Williamson.

347
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:12,465
从你的远行中我们得知
So, what have we gained by your expedition.

348
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,342
那女孩所讲的是真事
The fact that the girl's story is true;

349
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,135
这我从未怀疑
I never doubted that.

350
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,513
骑车人和庄园有关联
That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall;

351
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,306
这我也从未怀疑过
I never doubted that, either.

352
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,581
庄园租给一个叫威廉森的人
The Hall is tenanted by a man called Williamson.

353
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,631
谁敢保证就是他?
Who is the better for that?

354
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,527
我明天就去小酒馆
I shall go back tomorrow and visit the public house.

355
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,737
不 不要草率行事
No, my dear sir, do not commit yourself to rashness

356
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,074
因为你暂时很消沉
because you are temporarily depressed.

357
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,661
星期六前做任何事都是徒劳
We can do nothing useful until Saturday.

358
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,252
我真的做得很糟糕?
Did I really do remarkably badly?

359
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,920
没错
Yes.

360
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,273
非常美
Very beautiful.

361
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,691
谢谢 卡拉瑟斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Carruthers.

362
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,734
这是首新曲子
It is a new piece.

363
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,697
我得多加练习
I need to practice it more.

364
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,699
我不是指音乐
No, I don't mean the music.

365
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:27,291
维尔莉特 我有个问题想问你
Violet, I have a question to ask you.

366
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,106
早上好 福尔摩斯
Morning, Holmes.

367
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,384
维尔莉特・史密斯小姐的来信
A letter from Miss Violet Smith.

368
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,929
卡拉瑟斯向她求婚了
Now Carruthers has proposed marriage to her.

369
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:42,889
卡拉瑟斯!
Carruthers!

370
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,475
男士有求婚的权利 华生
Gentlemen are permitted to propose marriage, Watson.

371
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,936
他一定不知道西里尔
Of course he didn't know about Cyril.

372
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,480
你要去法恩罕?
Are you going to Farnham?

373
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,442
我想去验证我的一两个设想
I want to test one or two theories which I have formed.

374
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,651
我要一起去吗?
Shall I come with you?

375
00:28:55,776 --> 00:29:00,406
不用 那样既无用又多余
No, that will be neither useful nor necessary.

376
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,743
去最近的小酒馆
Try the nearest public house,

377
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,287
那儿是乡村流言蜚语的中心
always a good center for country gossip.

378
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,492
谢谢 华生 很好的提议!
Thank you, Watson, capital notion!

379
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,284
下午好 店主
Ah, Good afternoon, Landlord.

380
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,287
麻烦能来半品脱当地啤酒吗?
May I have half a pint of your local ale, please?

381
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,364
当然可以 先生
Certainly, sir.

382
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,947
给      谢谢
Here you are.        Thank you.

383
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,428
零钱你留着吧
You may keep the change.

384
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:49,348
您非常慷慨 先生 但不行
That's most generous of you, sir, but I couldn't.

385
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,434
我没理由接受您的慷慨给予
I haven't done anything to warrant such generosity.

386
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,311
我正打算给你一个理由
I'm about to give you the opportunity.

387
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,520
我需要一些信息
I need some information.

388
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,356
我不爱瞎扯淡 先生
Oh, I'm not one for idle gossip, sir.

389
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,201
我也是 我更喜欢事实
Neither am I, I prefer facts.

390
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,104
跟我谈谈查灵顿庄园的人
Tell me about the people at Charlington Hall.

391
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,532
你是指威廉森先生吗 先生?
You mean Mr. Williamson, sir?

392
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,158
是的
Yes.

393
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,185
他...他刚走不到五分钟
Well, he-he was in here not more than five minutes ago.

394
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:11,078
你们错过了
You just missed him.

395
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,079
跟我说说这个威廉森先生
Tell me about Mr. Williamson.

396
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,290
他是位年老及正派的绅士吗?
Is he an elderly, respectable gentleman?

397
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,318
他上年纪了 这毫无疑问
Oh, he's elderly, no doubt.

398
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,879
我决不会在背后说人坏话
Far be it from me to speak ill of people behind their backs,

399
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,968
但我不确定他是否为人正派
but I'm none too sure about respectable.

400
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:22,882
是吗?
Really?

401
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,136
据说他以前是位牧师
He is an ex-clergymen, I reckon.

402
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:27,887
以前?
Ex?

403
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,055
似乎是
Apparently.

404
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,224
他被除名了
He was struck off,

405
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,555
或什么牧师会有的处分
or whatever it is happens to clergymen.

406
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,870
医生才会被除名
That's doctors that are struck off.

407
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,773
跟我说说庄园里的其他人
Tell me about the other people up at the house.

408
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,734
他们都是家仆
Well, they're just domestic staff,

409
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,945
都是虔诚的本地人
and they're all local and God-fearing.

410
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,772
当然
Of course.

411
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,992
周末总会有一帮人聚集在庄园
He do have folk up there at weekends.

412
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,241
周末?      是的 先生
Weekends?        Yes, sir.

413
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,000
周末
Weekends.

414
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,685
没问题 什么样的人?
Ah, no problem. What sort of folk?

415
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,298
热情的一帮人
Oh, they're a warm lot.

416
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,299
热情?
Warm?

417
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,969
是的 热情得让人
Yes, the sort you won't want to get too near

418
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,763
不敢接近
for fear of getting burnt like.

419
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,765
很好
That's good.

420
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:16,102
你也许认为好 先生
Oh, you may think it's good, sir.

421
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:19,272
他们和村里人相处得不太好
They don't come down well in the village, I can tell you.

422
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:22,024
其中一个人尤为特别
There was one fellow in particular.

423
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,360
特别热情 是吧?
Particularly warm, is he, this fellow?

424
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,488
他非常特别 先生
He is very particularly, sir.

425
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,616
我打赌他蓄着红胡子
I'll wager he has a red mustache.

426
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,586
你认识他吗?
Hey, do you know him?

427
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,872
素未谋面
I never met the gentleman.

428
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,291
那你现在有机会了
Well, now is your chance.

429
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,254
伍德利先生
Mr. Woodley.

430
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,507
关你屁事!
None of your damn business!

431
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,801
店主开了如此体面的酒馆
Our Landlord keeps a very respectable house,

432
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,469
不是你撒泼的地方
and your language is not welcome.

433
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,554
你以为你是谁?
Who do you think you are?

434
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,857
你跑来问东问西
What the hell do you want 

435
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:55,057
到底想干什么?
coming here asking all them questions?

436
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,810
你说得很对 店主 他明显不是君子
You're quite right, Landlord, clearly not a gentleman.

437
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,188
彼此彼此
Oh, I'm as much a gentleman as you are.

438
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,865
在场所有人证明
Everybody here will bear witness to the fact

439
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,577
我是正当自卫
that I am acting in self-defense.

440
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,055
卑鄙小人!
Swine!

441
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,890
不 先生 是君子!
No, sir, a gentleman!

442
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,643
只有恶棍才会用手背打人
Only a ruffian deals a blow with the back of a hand.

443
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:42,355
而君子 则用左直拳
A gentleman uses the straight-left...

444
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,732
所以先生 我是位君子!
and I, sir, am a gentleman!

445
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:31,904
有趣极了 华生
It was absolutely delicious, Watson.

446
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,531
看出来了
So I see.

447
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:36,997
左直拳对抗乱舞的恶棍
A straight left against a slogging ruffian.

448
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:41,205
我挂彩了
I emerged, as you see.

449
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,791
乱舞的恶棍呢?
And the slogging ruffian?

450
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:48,422
伍德利先生用马车抬回去了
Mr. Woodley was taken home in a cart.

451
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,142
又是那个可怕的男人
There's that horrible man again.

452
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,522
哪个男人?
Which man?

453
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,847
我今天好像见到伍德利先生在花园里
I thought I saw Mr. Woodley in the garden today.

454
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:43,309
是的 他住在这附近
You did. He's staying in the area.

455
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:46,604
但别担心 我郑重地告诫他
But do not worry, I have told him quite firmly

456
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,274
再也不许踏进这座房子
he's not to set foot inside the house.

457
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,152
"亲爱的福尔摩斯先生
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

458
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,279
你一定已经料到
You will not be surprised to learn

459
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,687
我星期六将会辞去
that I will be leaving

460
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,159
卡拉瑟斯先生的那份工作"
Mr. Carruthers's employment on Saturday. "

461
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:07,333
可恶的伍德利先生又出现在奇尔顿农庄
The odious Mr. Woodley has reappeared at Chiltern Grange.

462
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:11,546
但起码这次她不用骑车去车站了
Ah, but at least she won't be bicycling to the station.

463
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,675
终于 富有的卡拉瑟斯先生
So finally, the rich Mr. Carruthers

464
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,343
找到马和马车了
has acquired a horse and trap.

465
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:18,386
的确
Yes.

466
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:23,808
看这 "一切烦恼将在星期六烟消云散"
Look here, "all my troubles will be over on Saturday. "

467
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,528
明天 福尔摩斯 
Tomorrow, Holmes, 

468
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:28,413
她的一切烦恼将会烟消云散
all her troubles will be over.

469
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,424
为什么我对那词感到不安
Why do I worry about that word.

470
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:32,850
哪个词?
Which word?

471
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,903
"马车"(亦有"陷阱"的意思)
"Trap. "

472
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:46,724
啊 多么美好的早晨 福尔摩斯!
Oh, what a splendid morning, Holmes!

473
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,559
在这个季节这天气尚算可以
It's acceptable weather for the time of year.

474
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,437
谁会在这么个早晨伤害那可爱的女孩?
Now who would want to harm that dear girl on such a morning?

475
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,980
希望没人会
I hope nobody.

476
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,774
那你怎么带着左轮枪?
So why did you bring your revolver?

477
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:58,980
我说的是希望 而不是推论
I'm talking about my hope, not my expectations.

478
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,823
怎么?
What?

479
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:07,913
我想那位是史密斯小姐
I fancy that is our Miss Smith.

480
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,499
她肯定想赶更早一班车
She must be traveling by an earlier train.

481
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,125
我只提前了半个小时
I give her a margin of half an hour,

482
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,281
但在我们会她前
but she'll be past Charlington Hall

483
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,213
她肯定早经过查灵顿庄园了
before we can possibly meet her.

484
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,365
那怎么办好?
So what can we do?

485
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,978
用跑的
We could run.

486
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:30,227
笨蛋 我早该想到提前出发这点!
Fool, I should have allowed for that earlier train!

487
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,963
是绑架
It's abduction,

488
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:03,259
华生 是绑架 谋杀 天知道怎么回事
Watson, it's abduction, murder, heaven knows what.

489
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,846
截停那马
Stop that horse.

490
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,403
太好了
Good man.

491
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,996
快来 华生!
Come on, Watson!

492
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,752
看看还能不能亡羊补牢!
Let's see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder!

493
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,322
那里!
Up there!

494
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:34,801
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

495
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,270
你们在哪找到的马车?
Where did you get that cart?!

496
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,730
维尔莉特・史密斯小姐在哪?
Where is Miss Violet Smith?!

497
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:43,009
这话该我问 这是她的马车!
That's what I'm asking you. You were in her cart!

498
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,645
马车在路上 上面一个人也没有!
It was on the road, there was no one in it!

499
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,900
似乎有人从这里走过!
Somebody seems to have gone through this way!

500
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,873
我们得找到他们!
We must find them!

501
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:58,900
来 华生
Come, Watson.

502
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:08,217
看 你认识他吗?
Now look, do you know who this is?!

503
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,343
彼得 马夫
That's Peter, the groom,

504
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,179
他送她上车站
he was taking her to the station.

505
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:13,306
他还活着 脉搏很有力
He's alive, his pulse is strong.

506
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,765
肯定是刚发生的事
Mustn't be left lying there too long.

507
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,475
别管他 不用我们救他
Let him lie, we can't do him any good,

508
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,469
但我们可以从一个女人会遭受
but we might save her from the worst fate

509
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:19,979
的最坏厄运中救出她
that can befall a woman.

510
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,647
你去哪儿?!
Where are you going?!

511
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:22,607
大宅!
The house!

512
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,983
他们没去大宅!
They didn't go to the house!

513
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,028
他们走了左边这条路
They went this way to the left.

514
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:27,945
你肯定?
Are you sure?

515
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,782
卑鄙小人!
Oh, cowardly dogs!

516
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,533
来不及了!      华生
Too late!        Watson.

517
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,331
他们强来 来不及了!
Too late by the living Jingo!

518
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,731
在上帝及其仆人的见证下
For as much as John and Violet

519
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:58,777
约翰和维尔莉特自愿
have consented together in holy wedlock,

520
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:05,759
缔结神圣的夫妻关系
and have witnessed the same before God and this company...

521
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,231
并且双方已经
and have declared the same

522
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:14,700
交换戒指
by the giving and receiving of a ring,

523
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:17,620
携手终老
and the joining of hands,

524
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:23,990
我宣布 你们结为夫妻
I pronounce that they be man and wife, together.

525
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,965
恭喜你们!
Congratulations!

526
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,285
谢谢 阿门
Thanks, amen.

527
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,435
他们结婚了!
They're married!

528
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:40,393
欢迎参加婚宴 先生们
Welcome to the party, gentlemen.

529
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:45,000
容我介绍伍德利太太
Let me introduce you to Mrs. Woodley.

530
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:47,040
不要 卡拉瑟斯!
Don't Carruthers!

531
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,986
卡拉瑟斯?
Carruthers!

532
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:00,663
是的 我要这姑娘安然无恙
Yes, and I'll see this woman righted,

533
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,498
即使为此上绞架也在所不惜
if I have to swing for it.

534
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:03,624
太迟了
You're too late.

535
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,543
她是我的妻子!
She is my wife!

536
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:09,422
不 她是你的寡妻
No, she's your widow.

537
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,133
我说过 如果你再骚扰她 我会怎么做!
I told you what I'd do if you molested her!

538
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,694
上帝为证 我言出必行!
By the Lord, I'm a man of my word!

539
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,098
你们雇我的时候
When you hired me,

540
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:23,060
可没说会发生这些乱七八糟的事!
nobody told me there'd be any of this damn nonsense!

541
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:24,562
把枪放下
Drop that pistol.

542
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:27,156
华生 拣起来!
Watson, pick it up!

543
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,652
把枪给我 不要再动武了
Give me that revolver, we'll have no more violence.

544
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,112
你是谁 在这指手画脚?
Who are you to be giving these orders?

545
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,573
夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

546
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:36,949
天啊
Good Lord.

547
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:39,952
你!
Here, you!

548
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,546
先生?
Sir?

549
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,414
你还能驾车到法恩罕吗?
Are you well enough to drive into Farnham?

550
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,928
是的 先生 我想可以
Yes, sir, I reckon I am.

551
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,116
把这张纸条
Then give this note

552
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:49,406
交给警察局局长
to the superintendent of the police station.

553
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:52,298
现在
In the meantime,

554
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:55,669
你们都受我的监管
I must detain you all under my own personal custody.

555
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:29,168
俩病人怎么样 医生?
How are the patients, Doctor?

556
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,212
史密斯小姐很好
Miss Smith's very well,

557
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:34,674
尽管受到如此恶劣的对待
considering the foul way she's been treated.

558
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,133
伍德利呢?
And Woodley?

559
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:38,845
唉 他还活着
Alas, I have no doubt he will live.

560
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:40,972
什么 那我上楼去结果他
What, I'll go upstairs and finish him off.

561
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,950
不 坐下 卡拉瑟斯
No, sit down in that chair, Carruthers.

562
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:45,226
你是对的
You're right.

563
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,228
他不值得我为他送死
He isn't worth swinging for.

564
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,429
但难道那姑娘真的得
But do you tell me that girl

565
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:50,523
一辈子受狂徒伍德利的束缚吗?
is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?!

566
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:52,066
用不着你过问
You needn't concern yourself about that.

567
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:54,752
我主持了婚礼 他们至死不渝
I married them till death do them part.

568
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:58,757
她不可能成为他妻室
Under no circumstances can she be considered his wife.

569
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:01,492
你确定?
Are you sure?

570
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,404
原因有二
For two very good reasons.

571
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,511
第一 我们完全可以
In the first place, we are very safe in

572
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,541
质疑威廉森先生
questioning Mr. Williamson's right

573
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,184
主持婚礼的资格
to solemnize a marriage.

574
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,752
我受任过圣职
I have been ordained.

575
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:13,171
已被免去圣职
And unfrocked.

576
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:16,382
一朝为牧师 终身为牧师
Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.

577
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,745
我不这么看
I think not.

578
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,406
那结婚证呢?
How about the license?

579
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:27,318
我们有结婚证
Oh, we had a license.

580
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:30,521
在这儿
I have it here.

581
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:32,857
无疑是用不法手段取得的
Undoubtedly obtained by a trick.

582
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,568
但无论如何 强迫的婚姻不是婚姻
But, in any case, a forced marriage is no marriage,

583
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:39,071
而你会发现 这是一项重罪
indeed, it is a very serious felony, as you will discover.

584
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:43,535
在等警察的这段时间里 卡拉瑟斯先生
Now, while we are waiting for the police, Mr. Carruthers,

585
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:46,822
说说你的事
you might tell me your story.

586
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:52,335
如果你把秘密捅出去 鲍・卡拉瑟斯
If you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers,

587
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,880
我会像你对付杰克・伍德利那样对付你
I'll serve you as you served Jack Woodley!

588
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:57,548
你不用瞎激动
There's no need for you to get over-excited.

589
00:45:57,632 --> 00:46:00,009
事情再清楚不过了
The case is clear enough.

590
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:06,057
既然你那么清楚 为什么不由你来说
Well, if it's clear enough, why don't you tell us.

591
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,725
很好
Very well.

592
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,102
卡拉瑟斯先生得适当补充细节
Mr. Carruthers will have to fill in a few details

593
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,104
以满足我个人的好奇心
for my private curiosity,

594
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:15,858
但我很乐意来讲述
but I am happy to do the talking.

595
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:16,909
首先
In the first place,

596
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:18,861
你们三个从南非来
the three of you came across from South Africa.

597
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:22,481
错了 我从没去过南非!
Wrong, I've never even been in South Africa!

598
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:25,852
是真的
It's true.

599
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:31,000
伍德利在我们回来后才找到这禽兽
Woodley acquired this creature after our return.

600
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,585
很好 你和伍德利
Very well, you and Woodley

601
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,130
在南非结识了拉夫・史密斯
had known Ralph Smith in South Africa.

602
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:41,008
你们相信他将不久于人世
You had reason to believe that he would not live long,

603
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:45,638
并发现他侄女将继承他的遗产
and you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune.

604
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:46,722
没错吧?
How's that?

605
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:49,884
你们却告诉她 她叔叔死时贫困交加
But you told the girl her uncle died in poverty.

606
00:46:49,884 --> 00:46:53,187
因为他明显奄奄一息
Well, as he was still alive, admittedly only just,

607
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:57,567
我想这有钱人没立下遗嘱
and a wealthy man who I suspect had made no will.

608
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:00,945
拉夫・史密斯不认字也不会写
Ralph Smith could neither read nor write.

609
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:06,325
因此你和伍德利回来寻找他侄女
So, you and Woodley came over here and hunted up the girl,

610
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,412
得知维尔莉特是他最亲的人
knowing she was the next of kin,

611
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:11,539
你们可以分掉遗产
and that you would share the plunder.

612
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:15,710
作为公证费 我也可以分得一份
I was due a share for services rendered.

613
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:18,045
而卡拉瑟斯
And Carruthers,

614
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:21,967
你却犯了个错误 
you made the mistake 

615
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,955
爱上了她
of falling in love with her.

616
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,891
生平第一次知道什么叫爱 福尔摩斯先生
The first time that ever I knew what love was, Mr. Holmes.

617
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:35,000
为什么你不告诉她她的危险处境?
Why didn't you tell her of the danger she was in?

618
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:36,901
因为...
Because-

619
00:47:38,196 --> 00:47:42,904
因为这样她会离开我
Because she would have left me,

620
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:48,145
我受不了这样
and I couldn't bear to face that.

621
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:58,127
我的女儿莎拉怎么办?
Oh, what will happen to my daughter, Sarah?

622
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:01,000
她会得到妥善照顾的
We'll see she's well taken care of.

623
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:11,224
尽管她不会爱上我
You see, even if she couldn't love me,

624
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,922
但能在房子里见到她
it meant a great deal to see her about the house

625
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:18,990
听到她的声音 我就知足了
and hear the sound of her voice.

626
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:22,560
你称之为爱 卡拉瑟斯先生
You may call it love, Mr. Carruthers,

627
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,705
我却称之为自私
I should call it selfishness.

628
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,078
也许两者是共存的
Maybe the two things go together.

629
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:33,579
但我想保护她
But I tried to protect her,

630
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:35,251
我从未让她
I never once let her go past this house

631
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:36,916
独自经过这座
where I knew those rascals were lurking

632
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,926
流氓潜伏的房子
without following her on my bicycle

633
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:41,387
我会亲眼看着她不受伤害
to see she came to no harm.

634
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:44,632
我保持距离并戴上假胡子
I kept my distance and wore that beard

635
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,218
这样她就不会认出我
so she should not recognize me.

636
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:51,055
然后我想你收到了电报?
Then I presume the cable arrived?

637
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,600
电报 什么电报?
Cable, what cable?

638
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:07,196
"老儿已死"
"THE OLD MAN IS DEAD."

639
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,640
哪个老儿?
What old man?

640
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:13,035
我想是在南非的拉夫・史密斯
I imagine Ralph Smith in South Africa.

641
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,203
是的
Yes.

642
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:16,038
但此时你和伍德利吵了一架
But by this time you and Woodley had quarreled

643
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,757
然后他离开了农庄
and he had left the house.

644
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:21,836
伍德利又来问我是否依原计划行事
Woodley came back again to ask me to stick to the bargain.

645
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,588
我拒绝了
I refused.

646
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,674
我说我不会使用武力
I said I would have nothing to do with violence.

647
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,000
最后一个细节
One last detail,

648
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:39,897
为什么由伍德利来充当丈夫?
why was Woodley chosen as the prospective husband?

649
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:45,328
这让我难以启齿...
I am ashamed to say it...

650
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:53,126
我们打牌 拿她做赌注
we played cards for her.

651
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:30,822
福尔摩斯 我知道判决结果了
Holmes, I have the results of the trial.

652
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:35,294
听着 法官总结说...
Listen to this, the judge in summing up said-

653
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:40,248
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

654
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:43,544
华生 我能否凭经验猜测?
Watson, may I be permitted an educated guess?

655
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:48,381
说吧
Go on then.

656
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,999
我想伍德利会被判刑10年
I would expect Woodley to get ten years,

657
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,010
威廉森7年
Williamson seven years,

658
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,720
至于卡拉瑟斯
and Carruthers,

659
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,530
鉴于审判时
in view of the eloquent speech 

660
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,933
我为他作的一番出色辩解
I made on his behalf at the trial,

661
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:00,893
大约6个月吧
probably six months.

662
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:06,691
丝毫不差!
That is exactly right!

663
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:09,569
我有些优势 华生
Well, I have certain advantages, Watson,

664
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:14,115
大部分数据来源于更早出版的报纸
largely the fact that I sent out for the early edition.

665
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,243
的确是优势
An undoubted advantage.

666
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:19,078
同时 我们收到了一份礼物
Also, we have received a present,

667
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:23,124
来自西里尔・莫尔顿夫妇的结婚蛋糕
some wedding cake from Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Morton,

668
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:24,883
随之附了一封信说
together with a letter telling us

669
00:51:24,883 --> 00:51:27,879
莫尔顿太太早前在南非的叔叔
that Mrs. Morton has inherited a large sum of money

670
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:32,216
拉夫・史密斯处继承了一大笔遗产
from her uncle, Ralph Smith, formerly of South Africa.

671
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,676
这对幸福的夫妇很乐意
The happy couple are thoroughly enjoying

672
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:36,137
在其父亲服刑期间
looking after young Sarah Carruthers,

673
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:39,140
照顾莎拉・卡拉瑟斯
while her father is in custody.

674
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:41,100
她的琴艺正不断进步
Her piano playing is improving

675
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:44,604
并且想学骑车
and she wants to take up bicycling.

676
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:48,333
到处都过着美好的日子 不是吗?
A splendid day all round, wouldn't you say?

677
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:51,027
还有更好的事要发生
There is more splendor yet to come.

678
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:53,362
更好的事 什么意思?
More splendor, what do you mean?

679
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,284
仔细看
Watch carefully.

680
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,953
哦 我想起来了
Oh, I remember,

681
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:03,205
将解决约翰・文森特・哈登先生
the chemical reaction that will solve the mystery

682
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:05,750
迫害事件中疑点的化学反应
concerning the persecution of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

683
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,459
没错
Precisely.

684
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,045
我在皇家科学博物馆泡了一个星期
I've spent the entire week in the Imperial Science Museum

685
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,342
我想这就是答案
and I think this is the answer.

686
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,668
那就是答案 福尔摩斯?
Is that the answer, Holmes?

687
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,105
没错 那就是答案 华生
Yes, that is the answer, Watson.

688
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:54,715
让我再想想
Well, let me think.
