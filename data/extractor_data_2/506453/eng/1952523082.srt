1
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,037
Thank you,
George.

2
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,706
From the point of view
of the criminal expert,

3
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:57,077
London has become a singularly odd,

4
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,545
interesting city.

5
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,447
Well, I hardly think you'll find...

6
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,616
...many decent citizens to agree with you.

7
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,185
Well, well, well,
one must not be selfish.

8
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,987
The community's the gain,

9
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,056
and no one the loser say the poor,

10
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:13,151
unfortunate specialist
whose occupation was got.

11
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,936
You must have been totally...

12
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,509
There's the case of the
papers of ex-President...

13
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,715
...and shocking affair of the
Dutch steamship Treesman,

14
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,718
which very nearly cost us both our lives.

15
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,587
Both of them great successes.

16
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,823
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes is not at home.

17
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,359
If I fail to see him now,
it will be too late.

18
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,361
But I'm sorry,
I cannot help you.

19
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,630
But it is a matter of the utmost urgency.

20
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,231
I have already told you,
young man, Mr. Holmes...

21
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,000
Mr. Holmes.

22
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,768
Well, I must see you.

23
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,370
I told the young man you weren't here,

24
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,771
but he wouldn't listen.

25
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,507
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
I'm nearly out of my mind.

26
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,922
I am the unhappy John Hector McFarland.

27
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,223
Now, tell us quietly and
slowly who you are...

28
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,043
...and what it is that you want.

29
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,161
You mentioned your name just now...

30
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,396
...as if I should recognize it,

31
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,764
but I can assure you,

32
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,733
beyond the obvious facts
that you are a bachelor,

33
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,268
a solicitor and a free
mason and an asthmatic,

34
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,258
I know nothing about you whatever.

35
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,710
Your untidy clothes,
sheaf of legal papers,

36
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,513
watch chain and your somewhat
irregular breathing.

37
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,751
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes,
I am all these things.

38
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,789
And in addition,
I am at this moment,

39
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,425
the most unfortunate man in London.

40
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,527
I mean, I've read your newspaper...

41
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,828
Not yet.

42
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,308
Then, if you would allow me.

43
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,906
'At about 12 o'clock last night,

44
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,342
an instance occurred at
Lower Norwood which points,

45
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,978
it is feared,
to a serious crime.

46
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,814
A small timber yard caught
fire at the back of a house...

47
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,151
...belonging to Mr. Jonas Oldacre, a builder.

48
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,487
Surprise was expressed
at Mr. Oldacre's absence,

49
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,072
and it became apparent
he had disappeared.

50
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,293
An examination of his room...

51
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,063
...revealed a safe which was open,

52
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,032
signs of a murderous struggle,

53
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,667
and a heavy walking stick...

54
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,036
...with stains of blood upon the handle.

55
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,237
As we...'

56
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,174
All I ask is that you don't abandon me.

57
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,643
A man has followed me
from London Bridge Station.

58
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,978
If they arrest me before I finish my story,

59
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,146
make them give me time...

60
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,248
...so that I may tell you the whole truth.

61
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,750
I could go to jail happy...

62
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,985
...if I knew that you were
outside working for me.

63
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,253
Arrest you?

64
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,389
This is really most gratifying.

65
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,424
On what charge do you
expect to be arrested?

66
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,226
Upon the charge of murdering

67
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,628
Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood.

68
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,398
Dear me.

69
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,805
'As we go to press,

70
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,341
sensational developments
have been reported.

71
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,510
Charred remains have been found...

72
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,113
...among the ashes of the fire,

73
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,349
and the police theory is that the victim...

74
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,586
...was clubbed to death
and the body ignited.

75
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,955
It is known that Mr. Oldacre...

76
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,957
...received a visitor last night,

77
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,426
and the stick has been identified...

78
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,595
...as belonging to that person,

79
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,363
a young London solicitor,

80
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,693
by the name of John Hector McFarland.'

81
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,441
May I ask why you are still
at liberty, Mr. McFarland,

82
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,645
as there seems to be enough evidence...

83
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,614
...to justify your arrest?

84
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,882
I live with my mother,

85
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,550
at Torrington Lodge in Blackheath,

86
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,584
but last night,

87
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,620
having late business with Mr. Oldacre,

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,355
I stayed at a hotel in Norwood.

89
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,796
Mr. Holmes, I knew nothing of this affair...

90
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,565
...until I was on the train
to my office this morning...

91
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,967
...and read what you have just heard.

92
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,670
I saw at once the terrible
danger of my position...

93
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,595
...and hurried to put the case in your hands.

94
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:42,396
Ah, Inspector Le Strade,

95
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,399
we have been expecting you.

96
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,134
Mr. Holmes?

97
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,502
Dr. Watson?

98
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,105
Mr. John Hector McFarland?

99
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,640
Yes.

100
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,709
I arrest you for the willful murder...

101
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,011
...of Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood.

102
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,446
Hold up,
just one moment.

103
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,981
A half an hour more or less...

104
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,382
...could make little difference to you,

105
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,451
and this young gentleman was
about to give us an account...

106
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,886
...of this very interesting affair,

107
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,354
which might aid us in clearing it up.

108
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,423
There will be no difficulty in clearing it up,

109
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,691
thank you,
Mr. Holmes.

110
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,626
Nevertheless, I think with your permission,

111
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,095
I would be much interested
in hearing his account.

112
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,764
Well, Mr. Holmes,

113
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,932
there's no denying that you have been...

114
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,501
...of use to the force...

115
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:24,471
...once or twice in the past,
but I must insist...

116
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,707
All I ask is that you should hear...

117
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,867
...and recognize the absolute truth.

118
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,217
I'll give you half an hour.

119
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,351
Sit down, McFarland.

120
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,227
Thank you, Le Strade.

121
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,268
We must warn you with
what you say now...

122
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,703
...will appear in evidence against you.

123
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,907
Pray continue.

124
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,344
I must first explain that I knew nothing...

125
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,613
...of Mr. Jonas Oldacre,

126
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,651
although his name was familiar to me.

127
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,654
Many years ago, my parents
were acquainted with him,

128
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,389
but... well,
they drifted apart.

129
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,926
And so it came as a complete surprise...

130
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,563
...when yesterday afternoon,
at about 3 o'clock,

131
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,808
he walked into my office in the city.

132
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,536
'Mr. Oldacre,
good afternoon,

133
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,071
I'm Mr. McFarland.

134
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,806
Would you care to come through?

135
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,206
Please, won't you sit down?

136
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,286
How can I help you?

137
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,498
This is a draft of my Will.

138
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,567
I want you,
Mr. McFarland,

139
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,037
to cast it into proper legal shape.

140
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,974
I shall sit here while you do so.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,783
You can understand my
astonishment, Mr. Holmes,

142
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,453
when I found that, with
some minor reservations,

143
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:23,590
his entire estate had been left to me.

144
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,394
'But I... I simply don't understand.

145
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,197
Well, then,
let me explain.

146
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm a bachelor,
Mr. McFarland,

147
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,835
with few relatives,

148
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,504
and none who deserve my consideration.

149
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,106
Well, that may well be so...

150
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,974
Let me...
let me finish.

151
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,509
I beg your pardon.

152
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,747
For many years now, I've
withdrawn from my business.

153
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,683
I was a builder, and though I say it myself,

154
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,019
an extremely successful one.

155
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,755
Successful enough to have
gained considerable wealth...

156
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,224
...and thus live out my life in complete,

157
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,324
if solitary,
comfort.

158
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,436
Many years ago,
I knew your mother.

159
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,439
Knew her,
and hoped to marry her.

160
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,442
Then she met and married your father.

161
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,579
I had no idea.

162
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,381
Well,
and why should you?

163
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,481
Three months ago, why,

164
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,219
I read of your father's death...

165
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,453
...in The Daily Telegraph,

166
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,223
and my mind was turned to your mother...

167
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,993
...and to the son who might
very well have been my own.

168
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:38,999
This is my way of securing your future.

169
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,934
I know that whatever I leave...

170
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,536
...will be in worthy hands.

171
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:47,608
What can I say,
but thank you?

172
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,010
There are a few documents
I think you should see...

173
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,678
...building leases,
title deeds,

174
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,778
mortgages and so on.

175
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,452
Well, now my mind's made up,

176
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,854
I shan't rest easy until
the whole thing's settled.

177
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:01,855
Yes, of course.

178
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,991
I beg you to come to my house tonight.

179
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,793
What shall we say,
9 o'clock?

180
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:06,627
Why, yes.

181
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,195
You'll of course bring the finalized Will,

182
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,730
and then we can settle the
matter once and for all.

183
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,664
Yes, of course.

184
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,764
Thank you,
my boy.

185
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,070
Oh, one last thing.

186
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,938
Not a word of this to your dear mother...

187
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,673
...until everything is settled.

188
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,809
I want it to be a little surprised for her.

189
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,843
Little, I...

190
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,244
You...
you promise?

191
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,344
You have my word.

192
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,533
I left in good time for my appointment,

193
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,869
but had difficulty in finding the house,

194
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,639
so that it was nearly half-past
before I reached it.

195
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,341
Good evening.

196
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,510
I have an appointment with Mr. Oldacre.

197
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,412
Mr. McFarland?

198
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,981
Yes, that's right.

199
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,789
It was not the warmest of receptions.

200
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,309
And the house itself had a
peculiar, unloved feeling.

201
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,001
Sorry to keep you waiting, my boy.

202
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:21,935
Not at all, sir.

203
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,337
I'm a little late,
I'm afraid.

204
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:24,538
Now, you brought the papers?

205
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,239
Yes, indeed.

206
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,339
Excellent.

207
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,144
The bedroom was on the ground floor...

208
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,964
...where there was a large safe.

209
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,422
'Bring the rest of those papers, my boy.

210
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,973
Now, to business.

211
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,867
All done?

212
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,836
Yes, sir,
all done.

213
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,704
Just seen the time,
my boy.

214
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,839
You must get home.

215
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,207
Oh, thank you.

216
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,808
I had a stick with me.

217
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,243
Ah, I wonder where she put it?

218
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,644
A rather heavy walking stick.

219
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,679
It belonged to my father.

220
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,148
Ah, never mind, I'll take
good care of it until we meet again.

221
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,051
After all, I shall be seeing
a great deal of you now, I hope.

222
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,151
Indeed you shall, sir.

223
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:48,989
I left him there.

224
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,491
The safe was open,

225
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:53,127
and the documents were on his desk.

226
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,429
It was too late to go back to Blackheath,

227
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,198
and so I spent the night
at a hotel in Norwood.

228
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,168
I knew nothing more of this horrible affair...

229
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,268
...until this morning.

230
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,614
Do you have the original draft of the Will...

231
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,282
...that Oldacre brought to you?

232
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,847
Why, yes, I...
I have it here.

233
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,926
May I retain this for 24 hours, Inspector?

234
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,262
It would amuse you.

235
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:33,233
Well, anything more you'd
like to ask, Mr. Holmes?

236
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,502
Not until I've been to Blackheath.

237
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,337
You mean Norwood?

238
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,107
No doubt, that is what I must have meant.

239
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,909
Now, Mr. McFarland,

240
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,811
my Constable's at the door,

241
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,546
there's a four-wheeler waiting.

242
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,056
Morning, gentlemen.

243
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,156
Morning.

244
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,746
There are certain points
about this document,

245
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,846
are there not Watson?

246
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,590
Well, I can read the first two lines...

247
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,393
...and these in the middle
of the second page...

248
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,128
...and one or two at the end,

249
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,997
I mean, they're as clear as print.

250
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,566
But the writing in between is very bad,

251
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,169
and there's several places
where I can't read it at all.

252
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,737
What do make of that?

253
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:20,007
What do you make of it?

254
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,376
That it was written on the train.

255
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,945
The good writing represents stations,

256
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:29,650
the bad writing movement,
and the very bad writing...

257
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,052
Passing over the points?

258
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,455
A scientific expert
would pronounce at once...

259
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,157
...that it was drawn up on a suburban line.

260
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,392
Since nowhere,

261
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,828
save in the immediate
vicinity of a great city,

262
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,298
could there be so quick
a succession of points.

263
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,301
Granting that his whole journey...

264
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,337
...was occupied in drawing up the Will,

265
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,922
then the train must have been an express,

266
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:58,312
stopping only once between
Norwood and London Bridge.

267
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,514
Yes, but it's curious,
is it not,

268
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,017
that a man should draw up
so important a document...

269
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,353
...in so haphazard a fashion?

270
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,389
And it suggests that he thought...

271
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,025
...it was going to be of no
practical importance.

272
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,460
Well, he drew up his death
warrant at the same time.

273
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:25,005
This case is not clear to me.

274
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,774
Come, Watson.

275
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,116
Where are we going,
Norwood?

276
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,285
No, Blackheath.

277
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,418
Come.

278
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:03,210
My son's the gentlest
creature on God's earth.

279
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,046
It's inconceivable he
could even contemplate...

280
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,315
...such a terrible crime.

281
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,452
He didn't even know the man, Mr. Holmes.

282
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,556
But you did,
Mrs. McFarland.

283
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,834
Years ago.

284
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,844
I'd forgotten that he ever existed.

285
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,012
I tried to forget.

286
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:41,248
It's impossible to quite forget...

287
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,484
...a man like Jonas Oldacre.

288
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,854
Yes, I knew him well.

289
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:51,625
At one time, we were
engaged to be married.

290
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,233
Thank heaven I had the
sense to turn away from him...

291
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,636
...and marry a better,
if poorer, man.

292
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:06,707
Oh, please.

293
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:18,118
Your husband died recently?

294
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:26,360
He was a kind man,
gentle man.

295
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:29,296
He was everything Jonas Oldacre was not.

296
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:33,816
And yet, at one time,
you were prepared to marry him?

297
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,806
I said that I knew him well,

298
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,274
but the more I knew of him,

299
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:42,342
the more I came to realize

300
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,179
I knew him not at all.

301
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:52,152
He would change suddenly,
would also frighten me.

302
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,757
There was a dark side to
his character, Mr. Holmes.

303
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,160
A desire to cause pain.

304
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,882
My own photograph.

305
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:25,953
It was my first present to him.

306
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:29,223
Good heavens.

307
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,358
That was how it was returned to me...

308
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,293
...on my wedding day,

309
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,896
together with a vile note...

310
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,332
...urging a curse upon my house...

311
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,734
...and saying he'd never forgive me.

312
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,637
And yet, he does seem
to have forgiven you...

313
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,807
...after all, to leave his
entire estate to your son.

314
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,475
Neither my son nor I want anything...

315
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,111
...from that wicked man,
dead or alive.

316
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:55,215
Mrs. McFarland,
the fact remains...

317
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,684
...that the Will was made.

318
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:05,188
I simply can't understand it.

319
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,163
Why?

320
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,099
Had you ever spoken of
Oldacre to your son?

321
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:16,704
I mean, perhaps told him
what you've just told me now?

322
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:17,971
No, never.

323
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,071
Never?

324
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,315
He found the photograph.

325
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,489
My husband tried to make light of it,

326
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,058
but he insisted.

327
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:42,930
My husband told him something
of the truth, that's all.

328
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,168
And the boy was disturbed?

329
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,771
He was upset,
naturally.

330
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:54,074
You see, Mrs. McFarland,
what the police might say is,

331
00:22:54,174 --> 00:23:00,781
that he had heard of
Oldacre's behavior toward you.

332
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:04,651
It would pre-dispose him
toward hatred and violence.

333
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,320
And so that case against him would be...

334
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,622
...considerably strengthened.

335
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,357
No.

336
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,327
There is a God in heaven, Mr. Holmes,

337
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,829
and that same God who's
punished that wicked man...

338
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,898
...will show in his own good time,

339
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:21,568
my son's hands are guiltless of his blood.

340
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,449
Wait here, please.

341
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,462
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson.

342
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,431
We're just clearing up.

343
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,531
The Will as promised.

344
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,673
Look, buttons.

345
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,642
Trouser buttons.

346
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:04,411
No doubt, you've brought
your glass with you?

347
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:08,182
The name is Hiams.

348
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,185
According to Mrs. Lexington,
the housekeeper, Hiams,

349
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,620
is the name of Mr. Oldacre's tailor.

350
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,610
Presumably, the organic remains...

351
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,226
...have been removed to the laboratory?

352
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,694
They have, Doctor,

353
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,163
though they'll be of little use, I suspect.

354
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,699
The poor devil was no
more than bone and cinder.

355
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,268
How very convenient for the murderer.

356
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,771
Not, I might venture,
for Mr. Oldacre.

357
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:34,208
Nevertheless, Inspector,
bones cinder.

358
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,878
Thank heavens, he was
wearing his trousers.

359
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,319
This stick belongs to the accused,

360
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,354
and he's never denied it.

361
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:48,956
He says that he could not find it...

362
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,457
...when he came to leave the house.

363
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,726
Says, Mr. Holmes, says.

364
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,162
My experts made out footmarks...

365
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:58,098
...of both men on the carpet.

366
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,239
And too much subsequent traffic...

367
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,008
...to make any examination
on my part worthwhile.

368
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:10,577
Two sets of footmarks,
Mr. Holmes.

369
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,802
None of any third person.

370
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,716
Another trick for your side.

371
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,318
I suppose all these
papers are from the safe?

372
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:19,686
Correct.

373
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,355
And nothing,
absolutely nothing,

374
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,556
has been removed?

375
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:23,991
Nothing whatsoever.

376
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:25,793
We have opened one or two,
as you can see,

377
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,561
to check the contents.

378
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,430
May I check them?

379
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,832
By all means.

380
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:34,802
I, myself, have business at The Yard.

381
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:37,071
Oh, and I would like to
see the housekeeper...

382
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:38,172
...what is her name?

383
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:39,740
Mrs. Lexington.

384
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,077
She'll add nothing more
to what you already know.

385
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,979
Nevertheless.

386
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,079
I'll send her in.

387
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,023
Could it be that for once

388
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,843
Le Strade is on the right track?

389
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,596
All my instincts are one way,

390
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,416
and all the facts are the other.

391
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:11,939
You wish to see me, sir?

392
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,674
Yes.

393
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:14,975
Mrs. Lexington, this is
my friend and colleague,

394
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,443
Dr. Watson.

395
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,313
Do sit down.

396
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,215
I'll stand,
if I may.

397
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:24,284
This room has no comfort for me.

398
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:33,127
You let young Mr. McFarland
into this house at 9:30?

399
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:34,428
Yes.

400
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:37,564
I wish that my hand had
withered before I'd done so.

401
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,634
And you retired to bed at?

402
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,803
20 minutes past 11:00.

403
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:47,374
20 minutes past 11:00.

404
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:50,244
And you heard nothing?

405
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,713
My room is at the far end of the house.

406
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,382
I heard nothing until
the fire alarm sounded.

407
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,751
It was then,
only then,

408
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:00,988
that I realized my poor
master had been murdered.

409
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,957
Mrs. Lexington,
to your knowledge,

410
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:07,628
did your master have any enemies?

411
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,197
Every man has his enemies.

412
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,000
And a businessman like Mr. Oldacre,

413
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,368
more than most,
perhaps?

414
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,003
He was a well-respected gentleman...

415
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:19,588
...who kept himself very much to himself.

416
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,445
Do you know anything about these papers?

417
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:25,446
I know nothing...

418
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,114
...of Mr. Oldacre's private affairs.

419
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,750
The buttons that the police
found in the fire?

420
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,553
My master had three suits
made by Mr. Hiams...

421
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,388
...two are still in that wardrobe there,

422
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,390
and the third he was wearing that night.

423
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,058
Thank you,
Mrs. Lexington,

424
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,793
you have been most cooperative.

425
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,138
What do you make of her?

426
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,533
Tight as wax,
if you ask me,

427
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,043
but then, perhaps that's her usual manner?

428
00:27:56,143 --> 00:28:00,414
It's all wrong,
I feel it in my bones,

429
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:07,955
something... something has not come out,

430
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,128
and that woman knows it.

431
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:16,986
Holmes, would you like me
to have a look at these papers?

432
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,400
Well, a man's bank account can tell us...

433
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,368
...as much as his diary.

434
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,470
Correct.

435
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:26,106
Thank you, Watson.

436
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,588
It's all right Constable,

437
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,524
I'm just stretching my legs.

438
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:45,624
I'll watch them.

439
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,995
Ah, Constable.

440
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,369
Are you a local man?

441
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:38,272
Born on Bridge, sir,
not a half-mile from here.

442
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:39,807
Excellent.

443
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:43,177
Then perhaps you can offer
me some local knowledge?

444
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:44,478
I'll do my best,
sir,

445
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:47,213
I'll most certainly do my best.

446
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:01,793
Holmes.

447
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:08,369
Le Strade did say that no
documents had been removed?

448
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,670
Yes.

449
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,838
That's what I thought.

450
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,039
You've found something?

451
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,041
No, it's what I haven't
found that interests me.

452
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,776
There are certain cross-references...

453
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,112
...to various deeds,
valuable deeds,

454
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,337
none of which I can find.

455
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,019
But one thing is clear:

456
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,254
Oldacre was hardly...

457
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,956
...in the affluent circumstances...

458
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,491
...we have been led to believe.

459
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:32,192
His bank account was practically empty,

460
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,294
largely because he had made
several large payments...

461
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:38,389
...in the past year to a certain Mr. Cornelius.

462
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,037
Young McFarland would
have inherited nothing.

463
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,605
This is of interest.

464
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,807
Why should a retired builder...

465
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,710
...have such large transactions
with a Mr. Cornelius?

466
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,812
Well, let's take our cab,

467
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,448
and see what we can find
out from his city bank.

468
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:56,216
You coming?

469
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:58,526
I'll stay here for awhile.

470
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,786
Norwood Station.

471
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,802
So, you're not going back to London...

472
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,537
...with your friend,
then?

473
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,338
No, not yet,
anyway.

474
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:21,075
I do hope my presence
doesn't inconvenience you.

475
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,143
By the way,
I should warn you,

476
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,513
I found an undesirable
lurking about by the gates.

477
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:27,481
I saw him on...

478
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:28,649
An undesirable?

479
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,184
A tramp,
Mrs. Lexington,

480
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,324
a gentlemen of the road.

481
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,354
He will get nothing here.

482
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,824
Ah, you don't believe in...

483
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:39,526
...supporting our less fortunate brethren?

484
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,563
I work,
so can they.

485
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,663
Quite so.

486
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,086
I'm on my way to Croxton.

487
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,426
I've done enough walking,
I have...

488
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,861
To all kinds of places.

489
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,961
I'll stay put.

490
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,803
I used to meet a friend of mine here.

491
00:33:55,903 --> 00:34:00,073
Oh, you might know him,
he's a seafaring man.

492
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:05,145
Aha, I know him.

493
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,817
Shared my billet for the
last four nights, he does.

494
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,521
And off he goes,
without even a word.

495
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:18,759
You take my tip.

496
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,694
Stay clear of him.

497
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:23,764
He's a liar.

498
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:27,201
He didn't strike me as such.

499
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:30,104
He goes up to that big house, he does.

500
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:34,174
He comes back here and tells some yarn...

501
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:37,845
...about him putting out with old mans,

502
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:40,681
and telling him to come back tomorrow...

503
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:42,316
...and they'll give him some grub...

504
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,966
...and some cast-offs for him.

505
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:47,018
Well,
how is that lying?

506
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,358
Because,
my friend,

507
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,828
I already paid my call.

508
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,764
I nearly got my lord on my back...

509
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:58,499
...for my insolence...

510
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,599
...insolence.

511
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,168
Perhaps he told you a pleasing tale.

512
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,916
Are you saying,

513
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:18,485
that a drunken sailor has more to offer...

514
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:22,256
...than a Sergeant in the 22nd?

515
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,758
No, no.

516
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:27,795
He's a liar.

517
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:35,102
He says, 'Whatever I get,' he says,

518
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:39,106
'I'll share with you,
shipmate, ' he says.

519
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:42,176
Off he goes.

520
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,512
Not a sight of him since.

521
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,053
Holmes,

522
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:12,699
you must permit yourself some food.

523
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,334
You must eat.

524
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:17,171
A present, I cannot afford energy...

525
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:20,076
...and nerve force for digestion.

526
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,411
Well, you must if you
intend to pursue this case.

527
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:26,213
I feel,
my dear fellow,

528
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,981
that our case will end ingloriously...

529
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,617
...by Le Strade hanging our client,

530
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:35,456
which will certainly be a
triumph for Scotland Yard.

531
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,925
There's a telegram.

532
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,407
'Important fresh evidence at hand,

533
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:55,776
McFarland's guilt definitely established,

534
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:59,313
advise you to abandon case, Le Strade.'

535
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:04,118
It is Le Strade's little
cockle-doodle of victory.

536
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,918
Let's have some breakfast,

537
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:45,850
and then go out together
and see what we can do.

538
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:51,231
I feel as if I shall need your company...

539
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,626
...and moral support today.

540
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,248
Ah, Mr. Holmes,
Dr. Watson.

541
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,950
I think you will acknowledge...

542
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,555
...that we're just a little
in front of you this time.

543
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,059
Step this way, if you please, gentlemen,

544
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,428
and I'm sure I can convince you...

545
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,497
...that it was John McFarland...

546
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:25,199
...who committed this crime.

547
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:28,702
I don't like being wrong any
more than the rest of us do.

548
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:30,404
Still, a man can't always...

549
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:32,806
...expect to have it his own way,

550
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:34,906
can he Dr. Watson?

551
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,488
This is where the housekeeper left

552
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,023
McFarland's hat and stick,

553
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:50,891
and this is also where
he would have come...

554
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,694
...to collect his hat after
the crime was committed.

555
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,396
Now, look at this.

556
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,632
A thumb mark.

557
00:39:58,765 --> 00:39:59,967
So I observe.

558
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,136
A thumb mark in blood.

559
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,872
You are aware that no two
thumb marks are alike?

560
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,947
I have heard something of the kind.

561
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:23,657
Identical.

562
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:27,667
And that was taken from
McFarland this morning.

563
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,731
Definitely the same thumb mark.

564
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,831
And that is final.

565
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,670
Quite final.

566
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,839
Who made this discovery?

567
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:40,808
It was Mrs. Lexington here...

568
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:44,563
...who drew my Constable's attention to it.

569
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:45,913
And, I suppose,

570
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,582
there is no doubt that the
mark was there yesterday?

571
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:50,617
Well, of course McFarland
could have crept out...

572
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,553
...of jail in the middle of the night...

573
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,922
...just to strengthen the
evidence against himself.

574
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,523
Ha-ha.

575
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,027
Have you any objection
if I take a stroll upstairs?

576
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,995
No, none at all.

577
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:04,900
There's nothing up there, though.

578
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:18,272
So many things look so bad, Holmes.

579
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:24,111
But there is a serious
flaw in this new evidence.

580
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,246
What's that?

581
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,349
That thumb print was not there...

582
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:32,713
...when I examined the hall yesterday.

583
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:47,568
Inspector Le Strade,

584
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:51,372
I cannot help thinking your
evidence is incomplete.

585
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:54,308
What do you mean,
Mr. Holmes?

586
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,076
Merely that there is an important witness...

587
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:57,845
...that you have not yet seen.

588
00:42:57,945 --> 00:43:00,047
You can produce this witness, can you?

589
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:01,582
I think I can.

590
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:03,050
Well then, do so.

591
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,918
I'll do my best.

592
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:07,321
How many Constables have you?

593
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,889
Three within call.

594
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,324
Excellent.

595
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,793
I assume that they are able-bodied,

596
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:15,029
large men with powerful voices?

597
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:19,566
No doubt that they are,
yeah.

598
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:22,669
In the outhouse, there
is a quantity of straw.

599
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,838
I would like two bundles brought in.

600
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,938
Straw?

601
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,902
And two buckets of water.

602
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,012
Water?

603
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,514
Ask them to bring it to the top landing.

604
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,129
Straw, into the fireplace,
a little bit in front.

605
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:52,599
Two buckets of water to
that side, Constable.

606
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,699
Mr. Holmes.

607
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:57,337
I don't know whether you're
playing a game with us,

608
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:00,341
but surely tell us without
all this tom-foolery.

609
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:02,142
I can assure you,
Le Strade,

610
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,244
I have an excellent reason
for everything that I do.

611
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:06,580
Watson, would you put
a match to that straw?

612
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,590
And Constable, will you
sprinkle it with water?

613
00:44:29,102 --> 00:44:31,805
Now, we must see...

614
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:36,643
...if we can find this witness
for you, Le Strade.

615
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,279
Gentlemen,

616
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:46,386
would you please join me
and we'll call a fire...

617
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,455
...one, two three...
FIRE.

618
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:49,490
Fire.

619
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,525
We can do better than that.

620
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,027
Full voice,
and together.

621
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:56,128
FIRE.

622
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:10,044
Good heavens,

623
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:15,315
Constable, a bucket of water on that straw.

624
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:17,317
Le Strade, allow me to present you...

625
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:21,021
...with your missing principal
witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.

626
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,791
What's this then?

627
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,560
What have you been doing all this time?

628
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,328
I've done no harm.

629
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:29,830
NO harm.

630
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,298
You've only done your best...

631
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,300
...to get an innocent man hanged.

632
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,636
If it wasn't for this
gentleman standing here,

633
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:38,172
I'm not sure you wouldn't have succeeded.

634
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:39,907
Take him.

635
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:44,278
Let us see where this rat has been lurking.

636
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:52,586
Now you see the advantage
of being a builder,

637
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:55,022
he was able to fix up his
own little hiding place...

638
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:56,790
...without any confederate,

639
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,892
save for that precious housekeeper of his,

640
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:01,895
whom I should lose no time in
adding to your bag, Inspector.

641
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:04,798
And these are the missing
papers, no doubt?

642
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:06,898
No doubt whatsoever.

643
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,203
Constable, find the housekeeper.

644
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:11,772
How did you know about
that place, Mr. Holmes?

645
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:13,941
When I compared the
proportions of this room...

646
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,909
...with those of the room below,

647
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:19,246
I deduced that this fireplace wall was false.

648
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:22,316
Oldacre clearly had a great deal of nerve,

649
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,251
but little enough,
I've found,

650
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:27,581
to like quiet before an alarm of fire.

651
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:34,495
How in the world did you know...

652
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:35,696
...that he was in the house at all?

653
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,064
The thumb mark,
Le Strade.

654
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,966
When I examined the hall
yesterday, it was clear.

655
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,834
Therefore, it must have been
put there during the night.

656
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:42,069
But how?

657
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:46,540
After McFarland had examined
the papers that night,

658
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,042
he resealed them.

659
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,611
To do so, he used his thumb upon the wax.

660
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:53,147
Brooding in that den of his,

661
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,315
it suddenly struck Oldacre...

662
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:57,851
...what use he could
make of that thumbprint.

663
00:46:57,951 --> 00:47:00,487
Smearing the wax with a little blood,

664
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:02,690
he made what appeared to be absolutely...

665
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,426
...damning evidence against McFarland.

666
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:09,696
But what was the object of his deception?

667
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,365
Ah, well,
you see Inspector,

668
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,167
in order to swindle his creditors,

669
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,002
who were pressing him,

670
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,404
Oldacre emptied his bank
account by paying out...

671
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,174
...several large sums to a
certain Mr. Cornelius.

672
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,042
Now, I have no doubt
that Messers Oldacre...

673
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:24,111
...and Cornelius are one
and the same person,

674
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:26,747
the object being to change his name,

675
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,383
draw on the money,
and then vanish.

676
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:32,052
We see before us a very deep,

677
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,655
malicious and vindictive man.

678
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,357
Did you know that he was once refused...

679
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,759
...by McFarland's mother?

680
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,762
All his life, he has longed for vengeance.

681
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,564
If he could give the impression...

682
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:44,798
...that he was murdered...

683
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,900
...by the only child of
his former sweetheart,

684
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,169
what more better revenge?

685
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,505
I would never have allowed any real harm...

686
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:53,073
...to befall poor Mr. McFarland,

687
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,041
I assure you.

688
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:55,909
That's for the jury to decide.

689
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,078
You're charging me?

690
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,413
For a joke?

691
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:01,115
It's nothing more than a practical joke.

692
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,983
It's nothing less than murder...

693
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,452
...the body in the fire.

694
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:09,990
But whose body was it?

695
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:11,859
And old sailor,
Le Strade,

696
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:14,094
who had fallen upon hard times.

697
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,096
When I examined the ashes of that fire,

698
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:22,136
I discovered that your
experts had missed this.

699
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:27,875
It is a tooth of the great white shark,

700
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:31,211
and you see that it has been lightly carved.

701
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:34,481
It is typical of the work
carried out by seamen.

702
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:37,384
Well, this isn't evidence enough...

703
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:40,204
...to show who died in the fire.

704
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,191
I know for certain that on Monday,

705
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,659
the day before the murder,

706
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,095
a tramp called at this house.

707
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:51,231
Yet, when I questioned the housekeeper,

708
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,199
she assured me...

709
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,802
...that no such tramp
would ever be welcome.

710
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:57,838
Not only was his reception welcoming,

711
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,674
but the man received some
of Oldacre's clothing.

712
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,777
Yesterday,
near the front gate,

713
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:06,613
I found the calling card that he left,

714
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:09,483
a coded sign advising his fellow travelers...

715
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,752
...of a charitable welcome.

716
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:12,486
And last night,

717
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,254
with the help of your local Constable,

718
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:18,325
I talked to one of these fellow travelers,

719
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,327
who said that the unfortunate seaman...

720
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:22,896
...had been asked to call
back the following day...

721
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:25,699
...with the assurance of further hospitality.

722
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:29,603
And so,
the next morning,

723
00:49:29,703 --> 00:49:32,172
wearing his new clothes,

724
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:36,710
or at least his new trousers, he returned...

725
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:39,346
...and was never seen again.

726
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,883
You've saved an innocent
man's life, Mr. Holmes.

727
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,487
You've also saved me
some embarrassment.

728
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,423
Ah, my good chap.

729
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:51,158
You will find that your reputation...

730
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:53,027
...has been enormously enhanced.

731
00:49:53,127 --> 00:49:54,995
Just make a few alterations to that report...

732
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:56,463
...which you are writing,

733
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,265
and they will understand how hard it is...

734
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,567
...to throw dust in the eyes
of Inspector Le Strade.

735
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,642
You don't want your name to appear?

736
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,839
Not at all.

737
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,613
His work is its own reward.

738
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:16,617
I'll see you hang for this.

739
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:19,692
That privilege must surely be mine.

740
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:30,153
