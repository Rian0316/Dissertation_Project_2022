伦敦已经变成一座十分乏味
London has become a singularly odd,

8

有趣的城市

嗯 我不认为会有很多正派的市民
Well, I hardly think you'll find

00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:08,998
对 对 我不应该自私
Well, well, well, one must not be selfish.

00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,877
这对社会有好处
The community's the gain,

13
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,034
除了可怜的专家
and no one the loser say the poor,

14
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,512
无事可做以外 谁也没损失
unfortunate specialist whose occupation was got.

15
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:27,503
你一定是...

有前总统文件案...

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,747
荷兰轮船"弗里斯兰"号的惊人事件
and shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Treesman,

18
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,913
后者险些害我们丧命
which very nearly cost us both our lives.

19
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,904
它们都成功解决了
Both of them great successes.

20
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,235
很抱歉 福尔摩斯先生不在家
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes is not at home.

21
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,879
如果我现在见不到他 就会来不及了
If I fail to see him now, it will be too late.

22
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:52,966
很抱歉 我帮不了你
But I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

23
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,332
但事情真的很紧急
But it is a matter of the utmost urgency.

24
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,966
我已经说过了 年轻人 福尔摩斯先生...
I have already told you, young man, Mr. Holmes ...

25
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,844
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes!

26
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,687
我一定得见你
Well, I must see you.

27
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,322
我跟这位年轻人说过你不在
I told the young man you weren't here,

28
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,818
但他不听我的
but he wouldn't listen.

29
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:06,670
对不起 真对不起 我几乎要疯了
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I’m nearly out of my mind.

30
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,348
我就是那个倒霉的约翰・赫克托・麦克法兰
I am the unhappy John Hector McFarland.

31
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:23,054
慢慢告诉我们你是谁
Now, tell us quietly and slowly who you are

32
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,863
有什么需要帮忙的
and what it is that you want.

33
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,201
你刚才只说了自己的名字
You mentioned your name just now

34
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,489
好像我应该认得你似的
as if I should recognize it,

35
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:30,439
但我确信
but I can assure you,

36
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:32,175
除了你是个单身汉
beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor,

37
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:35,188
律师 共济会会员 哮喘病患者这些显见事实外
a solicitor and a freemason and an asthmatic,

38
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,210
确实对你一点也不了解
I know nothing about you whatever.

39
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,307
你凌乱的衣服 随身带的那一扎法律文件

40
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,333
表链和不规律的喘气声

41
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:52,794
没错 福尔摩斯先生 你说的就是我
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes, I am all these things.

42
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,003
除此以外 此时此刻
And in addition, I am at this moment,

43
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,716
我还是全伦敦最不幸的人
the most unfortunate man in London.

44
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,908
要是您看过这份报纸的话
I mean, I've ready our newspaper ...

45
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,299
还没看
Not yet.

46
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,003
如果您允许的话 麻烦您念一下
Then, if you would allow me.

47
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,847
昨夜凌晨12点左右

00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:24,382
一住宅背后的小贮木场起火
A small timber yard caught fire at the back of a house

51
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,085
该住宅属于建筑师约纳斯・奥德克所有
belonging to Mr. Jonas Oldacre, a builder.

52
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,848
火灾现场未见户主 令人诧异
Surprise was expressed at Mr. Oldacre's absence,

53
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,700
显然户主已失踪
and it became apparent he had disappeared.

54
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,100
检查卧室

55

柄上沾有血迹
with stains of blood upon the handle.

59
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,509
正如我们...
As we ...

60
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,571
我只求您不要离弃我
All I ask is that you don't abandon me.

61
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,144
我在伦敦桥站刚下车就被跟踪
A man has followed me from London Bridge Station.

62
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:55,578
要是我还没把话讲完以前他们来逮捕我的话
If they arrest me before I finish my story,

63
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:56,762
务必请您告诉他们给我时间
make them give me time

64
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,953
把全部事实告诉您
so that I may tell you the whole truth.

65
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,553
只要知道有您在外面为我奔走
I could go to jail happy

66
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,883
我可以高高兴兴地走进监狱
if I knew that you were outside working for me.

67
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,205
逮捕你?
Arrest you?

68
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,397
这的确太有意思了
This is really most gratifying.

69
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,554
你会因什么罪名被逮捕呢?
On what charge do you expect to be arrested?

among the ashes of the fire,

77
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:33,479
根据警方推测
and the police theory is that the victim

78
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:37,912
受害者被木棍击毙 尸体被焚烧灭迹
was clubbed to death and the body ignited.

79
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,798
现已查明奥德克先生

85
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,664
麦克法兰先生 我想先问一下 你怎么仍逍遥法外呢?
May I ask why you are still at liberty, Mr. McFarland,

86
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,190
既然表面上已经有足够证据
as there seems to be enough evidence

87
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,547
可以逮捕你了
to justify your arrest?

88

我和母亲同住在

89

我在诺伍德一家旅馆住下来

93
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:23,349
福尔摩斯先生 我对此事毫不知情
Mr. Holmes, I knew nothing of this affair

94
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:26,520
直到今天早上乘火车回办公室途中
until I was on the train to my office this morning

95
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:28,765
看到报纸上您刚才听过的新闻
and read what you have just heard.

96
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,582
我立即看出自己的处境非常威胁
I saw at once the terrible danger of my position

97
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,991
就赶来把这件案子委托给你

再等半个小时左右
A half an hour more or less

00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,028
对你来说不会有什么影响吧
could make little difference to you,

109
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,119
这位年轻绅士正要给我们讲述
and this young gentleman was about to give us an account

110
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,515
这桩非常有趣事件的经过
of this very interesting affair,

111
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,245
也许能帮助我们把事情弄清楚
which might aid usin clearing it up.

112
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:26,004
我觉得弄清楚整件事再容易不过了
There will be no difficulty in clearing it up,

113
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:26,980
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生
thank you,Mr. Holmes.

114
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,671
不过 如果你允许的话
Nevertheless, I think with your permission,

115
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,489
我倒很有兴趣听听他的说法
I would be much interested in hearing his account.

116
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,194
好吧 福尔摩斯先生
Well, Mr. Holmes,

117
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,455
我很难拒绝你的要求
there's no denying that you have been

118
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:38,125
因为过去你给我们
of use to the force

119
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,264
帮过一两次忙 但我必须...
once or twice in the past,but I must insist ...

120
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,594
我只请求您一定要听我讲
All I ask is that you should hear

121
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:47,272
而且明白我讲的绝对是真话

122
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:55,551
我给你半个小时

谢谢 雷斯垂德先生
Thank you, Le Strade.

125
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:13,326
我得先提醒你 你现在所说的话
We must warn you with what you say now

126
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:16,489
都会成为不利于你的证据

127
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,680
请继续
Pray continue.

128
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:24,942
我必须先说明我对约纳斯・奥德克先生
I must first explain that I knew nothing

129
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,540
一点都不了解
of Mr. Jonas Oldacre,

130
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,405
虽然他的名字很熟悉
although his name was familiar to me.

131
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:33,535
很多年以前 我父母和他认识
Many years ago, my parents were acquainted with him,

132
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,248
但后来逐渐疏远了
but ... well,they drifted apart.

133
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,996
因此 昨天下午大约三点钟
And so it came as a complete surprise

134
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:42,787
他走进我城里的办公室的时候
when yesterday afternoon,at about 3 o'clock,

135
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,875
我感到很奇怪
he walked into my office in the city.

136
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,092
奥德克先生 下午好
Mr. Oldacre,good afternoon,

137
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,692
我是麦克法兰
I'm Mr. McFarland.

138
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:54,712
你是否介意过来一趟呢?
Would you care to come through?

139
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:00,963
请先坐下
Please, won't you sit down?

140
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:08,911
我有什么能为您服务的呢?
How can I help you?

141
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:19,242
这是我遗嘱的草稿
This is a draft of my Will.

142
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,441
我希望由你 麦克法兰先生
I want you,Mr. McFarland,

143
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:26,059
按照正式法定的格式把它写出来
to cast it into proper legal shape.

144
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:29,120
你写的时候 我就在这里坐着
I shall sit here while you do so.

145
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,302
您可以想象出来我的惊讶 福尔摩斯先生
You can understand my astonishment, Mr. Holmes,

146
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:42,094
当我看到他除了若干保留外
when I found that, with some minor reservations,

147
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:46,442
把其余的全部财产都留给我
his entire estate had been left to me.

148
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:50,407
但我真的不明白
But I ... I simply don't understand.

149
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:53,330
好吧 我来简单说明一下
Well, then,let me explain.

150
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,774
我是个单身汉 麦克法兰先生
I'm a bachelor,Mr. McFarland,

151
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:58,165
我没多少亲属
with few relatives,

152
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,913
没人值得我考虑的
and none who deserve my consideration.

153
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,582
唉 那样说也太...
Well, that may well be so ...

154
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,565
先听我说完
Let me ...let me finish.

155
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,164
请原谅
I beg your pardon.

156
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,583
近年来 我已经逐渐不问世事
For many years now, I've with drawn from my business.

157
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:13,644
我是建筑师 我敢夸口
I was a builder, and though I say it myself,

158
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,078
我在这个领域是出类拔萃的
an extremely successful one.

159
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,501
成功地赢得可观的财富
Successful enough to have gained considerable

160
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,505
过着离群索居
and thus live out my life in complete,

161
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,627
而又舒适的生活
if solitary,comfort.

162
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:34,236
很多年前 我遇到你母亲
Many years ago,I knew your mother.

163
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,366
相遇相知 想娶她为妻
Knew her,and hoped to marry her.

164
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,497
后来她嫁给你父亲
Then she met and married your father.

165
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,767
我完全不知情
I had no idea.

166
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,688
当然 你怎么可能知道呢?
Well,and why should you?

167
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,845
三个月前
Three months ago, why,

168
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,689
我听说你父亲
I read of your father's death

169
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,976
死于布莱克希斯
in The Daily Telegraph,

170
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,863
我就想到了你母亲
and my mind was turned to your mother

171
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:58,793
还有你这个本可能成为我儿子的年轻人
and to the son who might very well have been my own.

172
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:05,054
这是我让你生活无忧的方式
This is my way of securing your future.

173
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,071
我知道我留下的东西
I know that whatever I leave

174
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,707
能落在值得信任的人手中
will be in worthy hands.

175
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:14,029
除了感谢之外 我真不知道能说些什么
What can I say,but thank you?

176
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,533
这里有些字据 我想该让你过目
There are a few documents I think you should see ...

177
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,238
租约 房契
building leases,title deeds,

178
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,012
抵押凭证等等
mortgages and so on.

179
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,333
既然我已经拿定主意
Well, now my mind's made up,

180
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,837
在所有事情办完之后才能放心
I shan't rest easy until the whole thing's settled.

181
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:28,881
是的 理应如此
Yes, of course.

182
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:31,073
请在今晚来我家一趟
I beg you to come to my house tonight.

183
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,986
晚上9点如何?
What shall we say,9 o'clock?

184
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:33,856
G 没问题
Why, yes.

185
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,491
把遗嘱的定稿带过来
You'll of course bring the finalized Will,

186
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,090
我们就能把所有的事情都安排妥当
and then we can settle the matter once and for all.

187
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:38,064
是的 当然
Yes, of course.

188
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,073
谢谢你 孩子
Thank you,my boy.

189
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,664
噢 还有一件事
Oh, one last thing.

190
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,648
在一切事情还没有办完以前
Not a word of this to your dear mother

191
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,456
什么话都不要和你母亲说
until everything is settled.

192
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,648
我想给她一个小小的意外惊喜
I want it to be a little surprised for her.

193
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,761
小小的 我...
Little, I ...

194
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,221
你答应吗?
You ...you promise?

195
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:54,030
我向您保证
You have my word.

196
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,423
为了这次会面我提早出发
I left in good time for my appointment,

197
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,892
但那栋房子太难找了
but had difficulty in finding the house,

198
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,822
当我到他家的时候快9点半了
so that it was nearly half-past before I reached it.

199
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,562
晚上好
Good evening.

200
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,822
我和奥德克先生有约
I have an appointment with Mr. Oldacre.

201
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,840
你是麦克法兰先生吗?
Mr. McFarland?

202
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:30,518
对 就是我
Yes, that's right.

203
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,658
那算不上很热情的接待
It was not the warmest of receptions.

204
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:43,145
房子有一种怪异的 冷淡的气氛
And the house itself had a peculiar, unloved feeling.

205
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,389
抱歉让你久等了 孩子
Sorry to keep you waiting, my boy.

206
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:52,363
别客气 先生
Not at all, sir.

207
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,824
请恕我来晚了
I'm a little late,I'm afraid.

208
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:54,922
你把文件都带来了吧?
Now, you brought the papers?

209
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:56,382
是的 没错      很好
Yes, indeed.        Excellent.

210
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,885
卧室在一楼
The bedroom was on the ground floor

211
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,519
那里有个大的保险柜
where there was a large safe.

212
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,833
把其余文件都拿过来吧 我的孩子
Bring the rest of those papers, my boy.

213
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,825
现在开始工作吧
Now, to business.

214
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,053
一切都办妥了吧?
All done?

215
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,106
是的 先生 都办妥了
Yes, sir,all done.

216
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,053
瞧这时间啊 我的孩子
Just seen the time,my boy.

217
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:05,201
你得回家了
You must get home.

218
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,662
噢 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

219
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,297
我来的时候还带着一根手杖的
I had a stick with me.

220
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:09,827
哎呀 不知道她放哪去了
Ah, I wonder where she put it?

221
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:11,288
一根很厚实的手杖
A rather heavy walking stick.

222
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:12,223
是父亲留给我的
It belonged to my father.

223
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,455
哎呀 不要紧 我会好好保管
Ah, never mind, I'll take good care of it

224
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,494
等你下次来取
until we meet again.

225
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,967
毕竟从现在起 应该能经常见到你
After all, I shall be seeing a great deal of you now, I hope.

226
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,357
我们能经常见面的 先生
Indeed you shall, sir.

227
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,080
我离开了他
I left him there.

228
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,680
保险柜是开着的
The safe was open,

229
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:27,393
那些字据还摆在桌上
and the documents were on his desk.

230
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,828
已经太晚 回不去布莱克希斯了
It was too late to go back to Blackheath,

231
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,715
所以我在诺伍德的旅馆里住了一晚
and so I spent the night at a hotel in Norwood.

232
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,810
在今天早上以前 我对这起可怕的事件
I knew nothing more of this horrible affair

233
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,968
一无所知
until this morning.

234
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:48,750
你手上还有奥德克先生带给你的
Do you have the original draft of the Will

235
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,490
遗嘱草稿吗?
that Oldacre brought to you?

236
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,133
G 是的 我带过来了
Why, yes, I ...I have it here.

237
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:01,621
巡官 能把这些草稿借给我看一天吗?
May I retain this for 24 hours, Inspector?

238
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,055
假如能对你有所启发的话
It would amuse you.

239
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,237
你还有别的要问吗 福尔摩斯先生?
Well, anything more you'd like to ask, Mr. Holmes?

240
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,604
在我去布莱克希斯前 没什么要问的了
Not until I've been to Blackheath.

241
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,516
你是说去诺伍德以前吧?
You mean Norwood?

242
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:16,404
啊 对了 我要说的是诺伍德
No doubt, that is what I must have meant.

243
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,283
好吧 麦克法兰先生
Now, Mr. McFarland,

244
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,264
我的警士就站在门口
my Constable's at the door,

245
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,864
外面还有辆四轮马车在等着
there's a four-wheeler waiting.

246
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:32,996
早安 先生
Morning, gentlemen.

247
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,248
早安
Morning.

248
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,094
这份遗嘱的确有些特点
There are certain points about this document,

249
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,145
华生 你看呢?
are there not Watson?

250
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:43,433
嗯 我能看出头两行
Well, I can read the first two lines

251
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:46,355
还有第二页中间几句
and these in the middle of the second page

252
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,164
还有最后一两行
and one or two at the end,

253
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,112
就跟印上去的一样清晰
I mean, they're as clear as print.

254
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,920
但其余部分都写得不清楚
But the writing in between is very bad,

255
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,982
有几处地方根本看不出写的是什么
and there's several places where I can't read it at all.

256
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:54,754
你怎么解释这一点呢?
What do make of that?

257
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,213
你怎么解释呢?
What do you make of it?

258
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,912
是在火车上写的
That it was written on the train.

259
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:05,695
清晰的部分是火车停站的时候写的
The good writing represents stations,

260
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,600
模糊的部分是火车行驶时写的 最不清晰的部分...
the bad writing movement,and the very bad writing ...

261
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,104
是火车经过岔道时写的?
Passing over the points?

262
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,608
有经验的专家能马上断定
A scientific expert would pronounce at once

263
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:18,392
这是在一条郊区铁路线上写的
that it was drawn upon a suburban line.

264
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,677
因为
Since nowhere,

265
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:22,253
只有在大城市附近
save in the immediate vicinity of a great city,

266
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,870
才会有接二连三的岔道
could there be so quick a succession of points.

267
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:29,001
假如他花了整个旅程的时间
Granting that his whole journey

268
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,165
来起草这份遗嘱
was occupied in drawing up the Will,

269
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,887
那必定是一趟快车
then the train must have been an express,

270
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,479
在诺伍德和伦敦桥之间只停过一次
stopping only once between Norwood and London Bridge.

271
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,740
没错 但这实在是太奇怪了
Yes, but it's curious,is it not,

272
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,427
一个人居然会以这么随便的方式
that a man should draw up so important a document

273
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,861
来写一份这么重要的文件?
in so haphazard fashion?

274
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,027
这说明他实际上
And it suggests that he thought

275
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,741
并不重视这份遗嘱
it was going to be of no practical importance.

276
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:58,079
这等于他同时给自己出了一张死刑判决书
Well, he drew up his death warrant at the same time.

277
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:08,306
这件案件对我来说还不是很清楚
This case is not clear to me.

278
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,540
走吧 华生
Come, Watson!

279
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,889
我们去哪呢 诺伍德?
Where are we going,Norwood?

280
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,150
不 布莱克希斯
No, Blackheath.

281
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:23,367
走吧!
Come!

282
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,134
我儿是天底下最敦厚良善的人
My son's the gentlest creature on God's earth.

283
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,091
我绝不相信他会犯下
It's inconceivable he could even contemplate

284
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,456
如此严重的罪行
such a terrible crime.

285
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,768
他根本不认识这个人 福尔摩斯先生
He didn't even know the man, Mr. Holmes.

286
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:01,005
但你认识他 麦克法兰夫人
But you did,Mrs. McFarland.

287
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,779
多年以前的事了
Years ago.

288
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:17,318
我几乎忘记了他的存在
I'd forgotten that he ever existed.

289
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,457
我尝试去忘却
I tried to forget.

290
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:27,753
但要忘记像约纳斯・奥德克这样的人
It's impossible to quite forget

291
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:30,118
是不可能的
a man like Jonas Oldacre.

292
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:34,594
是的 我很了解他
Yes, I knew him well.

293
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,720
曾经 我们几乎订婚结为夫妇
At one time, we were engaged to be married.

294
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,501
谢天谢地我还有眼力离开他
Thank heaven I had the sense to turn away from him

295
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:50,084
跟一个也许比他穷 但比他更好的人结了婚
and marry a better,if poorer, man.

296
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,328
噢 请坐
Oh, please.

297
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:06,224
你丈夫最近去世了?
Your husband died recently?

298
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:14,816
他是一个宽容 温和的人
He was a kind man,gentle man.

299
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:17,877
他是和约纳斯・奥德克完全不一样的人
He was everything Jonas Oldacre was not.

300
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:21,668
然而 你曾经考虑过嫁给他?
And yet, at one time,you were prepared to marry him?

301
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:27,790
我说过我熟悉他
I said that I knew him well,

302
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,321
我越了解他
but the more I knew of him,

303
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,477
就越意识到
the more I came to realize

304
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,434
自己根本不清楚他的为人
I knew him not at all.

305
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:41,703
他会突然性情大变 还会恐吓我
He would change suddenly,would also frighten me.

306
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:46,504
在他性格里有阴暗的一面 福尔摩斯先生
There was a dark side to his character, Mr. Holmes.

307
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:50,051
想要制造痛苦的欲望
A desire to cause pain.

308
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:12,696
我自己的照片
My own photograph.

309
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,940
是送给他的第一份礼物
It was my first present to him.

310
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,349
天哪!
Good heavens!

311
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,541
在我结婚的那天
That was how it was returned to me

312
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,591
他把照片弄成这样还给我
on my wedding day,

313
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:27,306
附着一张卑劣的纸条
together with a vile note

314
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,845
疯狂地诅咒我的家人
urging a curse upon my house

315
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,349
说他永远都不会原谅我
and saying he'd never forgive me.

316
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:35,376
不过 看上去他现在宽恕你了...
And yet, he does seem to have forgiven you ...

317
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,644
毕竟他把自己的全部财产留给了你的儿子
after all, to leave his entire estate to your son.

318
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,385
我儿子和我都不要那个恶人的
Neither my son nor I want anything

319
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:43,133
任何东西 不管他是死是活
from that wicked man,dead or alive.

320
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:47,445
麦克法兰夫人 事实是
Mrs. McFarland,the fact remains

321
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:50,019
遗嘱已经拟好
that the Will was made.

322
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:57,637
我只不过不明白
I simply can't understand it.

323
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,950
为什么?
Why?

324
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,046
你有向儿子谈论过奥德克先生的事吗?
Had you ever spoken of Oldacre to your son?

325
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,073
也许提到过刚才告诉我们的事实?
I mean, perhaps told him what you've just told me now?

326
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,133
不 从未说过
No, never.

327
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:13,220
从来没有?
Never?

328
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:21,951
他看到了照片
He found the photograph.

329
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,394
先夫想轻描淡写说一下就算了
My husband tried to make light of it,

330
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:32,108
但他坚持要知道缘由
but he insisted.

331
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:37,187
先夫将部分事实真相告诉他 仅此而已
My husband told him something of the truth, that's all.

332
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:42,648
这孩子听了之后很不安吗?
And the boy was disturbed?

333
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:45,361
他很自然会心烦意乱
He was upset,naturally.

334
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,804
情况是这样的 麦克法兰夫人 警方可能会认为
You see, Mrs. McFarland,what the police might say is,

335
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:55,796
他听闻了奥德克先生对你的所作所为
that he had heard of Oldacre's behavior toward you.

336
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,831
自然会产生憎恨之心 犯下暴行
It would pre-dispose him toward hatred and violence.

337
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:01,535
该案对他的指控
And so that case against him would be

338
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,970
就有更强而有力的依据了
considerably strengthened.

339
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,745
不
No.

340
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:08,875
主在天堂俯视众生 福尔摩斯先生
There is a God in heaven, Mr. Holmes,

341
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,484
主终会惩罚这个邪恶的人
and that same God who's punished that wicked man

342
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,640
只争迟与早
will show in his own good time,

343
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,388
我儿手上确实没沾染过血污
my son's hands are guiltless of his blood.

344
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,327
请在这儿等我一下
Wait here, please.

345
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:45,502
福尔摩斯先生 华生先生
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson.

346
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:47,554
我们刚刚清理完毕
We're just clearing up.

347
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,711
这是我之前借阅的遗嘱
The Will as promised.

348
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:57,189
看 纽扣
Look, buttons!

349
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,242
裤子的纽扣
Trouser buttons.

350
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:02,129
很可能 你有带放大镜过来吗?
No doubt, you've brought your glass with you?

351
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:06,060
上面的名字是海安姆
The name is Hiams.

352
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,191
据管家勒克辛顿太太说 海安姆
According to Mrs. Lexington,the housekeeper, Hiams,

353
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:11,729
是奥德克先生的裁缝的姓氏
is the name of Mr. Oldacre's tailor.

354
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,756
想必燃烧过后的有机体残骸
Presumably, the organic remains

355
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,539
已经送去实验室化验了吧?
have been removed to the laboratory?

356
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:19,104
是的 医生
They have, Doctor,

357
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,677
虽然未必能派上什么用场
though they'll be of little use, I suspect.

358
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:24,321
这个倒霉的家伙早已烧成灰烬
The poor devil was no more than bone and cinder.

359
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,999
对凶手来说多么方便啊
How very convenient for the murderer.

360
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:29,609
虽然对奥德克先生来说可不怎么方便
Not I might venture for Mr. Oldacre.

361
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:33,191
虽然如此 巡官 好歹是骨头渣子啊
Nevertheless, Inspector,bones cinder.

362
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,765
谢天谢地  幸好他还穿着裤子
Thank heavens, he was wearing his trousers.

363
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:44,774
那根手杖的确是属于被告的
This stick belongs to the accused,

364
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,896
他也承认了
and he's never denied it.

365
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,531
他声称离开房子的时候
He says that he could not find it

366
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,131
找不到那根手杖
when he came to leave the house.

367
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:52,496
一面之词 福尔摩斯先生 一面之词
Says, Mr. Holmes, says.

368
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:55,036
我的技术人员在地毯上
My experts made out footmarks

369
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,096
找到两组脚印
of both men on the carpet.

370
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:05,505
之后有无数人踏足此处
And too much subsequent traffic

371
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:08,427
所以我基本上查不出什么来
to make any examination on my part worthwhile.

372
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:11,105
有两组脚印 福尔摩斯先生
Two sets of footmarks,Mr. Holmes.

373
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,366
没有第三者的脚印
None of any third person.

374
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,463
给你们布的又一个疑阵
Another trick for your side.

375
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,140
依我看 这些字据都是从保险柜里拿出来的吧?
I suppose all these papers are from the safe?

376
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,601
没错
Correct.

377
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,306
没有 没有任何东西
And nothing,absolutely nothing,

378
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:23,559
被移动过?
has been removed?

379
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,089
什么都没有
Nothing whatsoever.

380
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:26,967
如你所见 有一两封已经拆开
We have opened one or two,as you can see,

381
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,810
来检查里面的内容
to check the contents.

382
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,759
我可以看看吗?
May I check them?

383
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:33,263
当然可以
By all means.

384
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:36,359
我还得回苏格兰场办点事
I, myself, have business at The Yard.

385
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,724
对了 我想见一下女管家
Oh, and I would like to see the housekeeper ...

386
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,837
她叫什么名字?
what is her name?

387
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,507
勒克辛顿太太
Mrs. Lexington.

388
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:44,374
她也提供不了什么新情况
She'll add nothing more to what you already know.

389
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,011
还是让我见见吧
Nevertheless.

390
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,403
我让她进来吧
I'll send her in.

391
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,482
难道这会成为
Could it be that for once

392
00:26:58,586 --> 00:27:00,951
雷斯垂德有史以来第一次胜利?
Le Strade is on the right track?

393
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,334
我的所有直觉都指向一个方向
All my instincts are one way,

394
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,213
事情另有隐衷
and all the facts are the other.

395
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,038
先生 你要见我?
You wish to see me, sir?

396
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,614
是的 勒克辛顿太太
Yes,Mrs. Lexington

397
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,239
这位是我的挚友及同事
this is my friend and colleague,

398
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,770
华生医生
Dr. Watson.

399
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,761
请坐
Do sit down.

400
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,744
如果可以的话 请容许我站着
I'll stand,if I may.

401
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:28,256
这房间让我觉得不太舒服
This room has no comfort for me.

402
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:37,186
你让麦克法兰先生进来的时候是9点半吗?
You let young Mr. McFarland into this house at 9:30?

403
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,509
是的
Yes.

404
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:42,066
当时我该好好考虑一下的
I wish that my hand had withered before I'd done so.

405
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,466
你在什么时候上床休息的呢?
And you retired to bed at?

406
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,501
十一点二十分
20 minutes past 11:00.

407
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:51,842
十一点二十分
20 minutes past 11:00.

408
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:55,319
你什么都没听到吗?
And you heard nothing?

409
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,892
我的房间在房子另一头
My room is at the far end of the house.

410
00:27:57,997 --> 00:28:00,640
在火警响起前什么都没听到
I heard nothing until the fire alarm sounded.

411
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,735
就在那个时候
It was then,only then,

412
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,484
我意识到不幸的主人已经被谋害了
that I realized my poor master had been murdered.

413
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:09,614
勒克辛顿太太 据你所知
Mrs. Lexington,to your knowledge,

414
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,441
你的主人有仇人吗?
did your master have any enemies?

415
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,119
谁没有仇人呢
Every man has his enemies.

416
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:19,041
像奥德克先生这样的生意人
And a businessman like Mr. Oldacre,

417
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:20,467
也许仇家就更多了 是吧?
more than most,perhaps?

418
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:22,136
他是一位受人尊敬的绅士
He was a well-respected gentleman

419
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,433
一直独来独往
who kept himself very much to himself.

420
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,999
你对这些字据是否知情?
Do you know anything about these papers?

421
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,077
我对奥德克先生的私人事务
I know nothing

422
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,781
一无所知
of Mr. Oldacre'sprivate affairs.

423
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,529
警方在灰烬里发现的纽扣呢?
The buttons that the police found in the fire?

424
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,486
主人有三套衣服是由海安姆先生缝制的
My master had three suits made by Mr. Hiams ...

425
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,399
两套在衣橱里
two are still in that wardrobe there,

426
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:42,486
第三套当天晚上他穿在身上
and the third he was wearing that night.

427
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,191
谢谢你 勒克辛顿太太
Thank you,Mrs. Lexington,

428
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,660
你非常很合作
you have been most cooperative.

429
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,861
你觉得她怎么样?
What do you make of her?

430
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,852
守口如瓶 依我看
Tight as wax,if you ask me,

431
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:03,762
但也许这只是她一贯的作风
but then, perhaps that's her usual manner?

432
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,149
我知道一切都不对 我从骨子里感受到
It's all wrong,I feel it in my bones,

433
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:15,981
还有些重要情况是我们一无所知的
something ... something has not come out,

434
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,611
而女管家是知道的
and that woman knows it.

435
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:24,019
福尔摩斯 能让我看看这些字据吗?
Holmes, would you like me to have a look at these papers?

436
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,323
一个人的银行账号所透露的信息
Well, a man's bank account can tell us

437
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:29,375
就和日记所泄露的一样多
as much as his diary.

438
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,922
没错
Correct.

439
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,670
谢谢 华生
Thank you, Watson.

440
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:51,079
没事的 警官
It's all right Constable,

441
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:53,097
我只是舒展一下腿脚而已
I'm just stretching my legs.

442
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,045
我会看着他们的
I'll watch them.

443
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:43,397
啊 警官
Ah, Constable.

444
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:49,693
你是本地人吗?
Are you a local man?

445
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,667
我在伦敦桥出生 先生 离这儿半公里
Born on Bridge, sir,not a half-mile from here.

446
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,200
太好了
Excellent.

447
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,371
你能给我提供一点当地的消息吗?
Then perhaps you can offer me some local knowledge?

448
00:31:58,408 --> 00:31:59,189
我会尽力而为的 先生
I'll do my best,sir,

449
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,102
一定尽我所能
I'll most certainly do my best.

450
00:32:15,155 --> 00:32:16,198
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

451
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:24,094
雷斯垂德确实说过字据都没有被动过吧?
Le Strade did say that no documents had been removed?

452
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,452
是的
Yes.

453
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:26,633
我也觉得他没动过
That's what I thought.

454
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:27,886
你有什么发现吗?
You've found something?

455
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,008
没有 一无所获才令我觉得很奇怪
No, it's what I haven't found that interests me.

456
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:31,782
比对过后发现
There are certain cross-references

457
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:34,250
确实发生过几笔交易 金额颇大的交易
to various deeds,valuable deeds,

458
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:36,374
但找不到凭证
none of which I can find.

459
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,461
但有一事相当明确
But one thing is clear:

460
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,748
我们有理由相信
Oldacre was hardly

461
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:45,521
奥德克先生的境况
in the affluent circumstances

462
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:47,156
并不是太富裕
we have been led to believe.

463
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:48,896
他的银行帐户余额所剩无几
His bank account was practically empty,

464
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,087
主要是因为过去一年里
largely because he had made several large payments

465
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:54,322
他开了几张大额支票给柯尼利亚斯先生
in the past year to a certain Mr. Cornelius.

466
00:32:57,418 --> 00:33:00,234
麦克法兰先生实际上一无所得
Young McFarland would have inherited nothing.

467
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,870
此事大有蹊跷
This is of interest.

468
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,130
为什么一个退隐的建筑师
Why should a retired builder

469
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:07,193
会和这位柯尼利亚斯先生有这样的大宗交易呢?
have such large transactions with a Mr. Cornelius?

470
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:09,348
嗳 我们坐车回城
Well, let's take our cab,

471
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,096
看看能不能从他的银行账号里找到什么线索
and see what we can find out from his city bank.

472
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,974
一起吗?
You coming?

473
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,887
我想再多留一会
I'll stay here for a while.

474
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:18,984
诺伍德火车站
Norwood Station.

475
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:33,350
那么 你不打算和朋友
So, you're not going back to London

476
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:35,124
一起回伦敦了?
with your friend,then?

477
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,036
不 暂时先不回去
No, not yet,anyway.

478
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,854
希望我的存在不会给你造成不便
I do hope my presence doesn't inconvenience you.

479
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,045
顺便提一下 我应当警告你一下
By the way,I should warn you,

480
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,558
我发现有形迹可疑的人在大门窥视
I found an undesirable lurking about by the gates.

481
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:46,567
我看到他...
I saw him on ...

482
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:47,749
形迹可疑的人
An undesirable?

483
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,385
一个流浪汉 勒克辛顿太太
A tramp,Mrs. Lexington,

484
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,541
流落街头的男人
a gentlemen of the road.

485
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,732
我什么都给不了他
He will get nothing here.

486
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:56,307
啊 你不认为应该对
Ah, you don't believe in

487
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:59,090
比我们不幸的人伸出援手吗?
supporting our less fortunate brethren?

488
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:02,290
我能养活自己 他们也理应如此
I work,so can they.

489
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:03,785
的确是这样
Quite so.

490
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:01,214
我在去克莱克斯顿的路上
I'm on my way to Croxton.

491
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:07,823
我已经流浪够了
I've done enough walking,I have...

492
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:10,362
走遍各个地方
To all kinds of places.

493
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,788
就留在这里吧
I'll stay put.

494
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,641
我曾在这里和朋友会面
I used to meet a friend of mine here.

495
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:23,093
噢 你可能会认识他 他是个海员
Oh, you might know him,he's a seafaring man.

496
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:28,299
阿哈 我知道有这么个人
Ah-ha I know him

497
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,250
和我一起睡了四晚的人 就是他
Shared my billet for the last four nights, he does.

498
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,080
之后他就一言不发地离开了
And off he goes,without even a word.

499
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:41,555
你听我的话
You take my tip.

500
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:44,022
和他撇清关系
Stay clear of him.

501
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:47,894
他是个骗子
He's a liar.

502
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:51,477
他可没有这样对待过我
He didn't strike me as such.

503
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,503
他去过那个大房子里 他去了
He goes up to that big house, he does.

504
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:58,746
他回来之后就瞎扯淡
He comes back here and tells some yarn

505
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:02,573
说和那里的老先生聊得很欢
about him putting out with old mans,

506
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:05,529
那位先生让他第二天再过去
and telling him to come back tomorrow

507
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,198
说是会给他一点食物
and they'll give him some grub

508
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,912
还有几件旧衣物
and some cast-offs for him.

509
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:11,547
嗯 这怎么算是撒谎呢?
Well,how is that lying?

510
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,556
因为 我的朋友
Because,my friend,

511
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:20,174
我也曾经去过一次
I already paid my call.

512
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,190
结果几乎被打死
I nearly got my lord on my back

513
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:23,965
说我厚颜无耻
for my insolence ...

514
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:26,156
无礼之极
insolence.

515
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:36,070
也许他说的故事更讨人喜欢
Perhaps he told you a pleasing tale.

516
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,157
你是说
Are you saying,

517
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:44,835
一个醉酒的船员比我这个22军团的军士
that a drunken sailor has more to offer

518
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,766
还有办法?
than a Sergeant in the 22nd?

519
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:51,375
不 不
No, no.

520
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:54,749
他是个骗子
He's a liar.

521
00:36:54,854 --> 00:37:02,367
他说 "无论我得到什么"
He says, Whatever I get,he says,

522
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,540
"我都会和你一起分享的 伙计" 他是这样说的
I'll share with you,shipmate,  he says.

523
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:09,741
之后他就走了
Off he goes.

524
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,219
从此不见踪影
Not a sight of him since.

525
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,944
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

526
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:44,109
你得先吃点东西啊
you must permit yourself some food.

527
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:45,779
一定得吃
You must eat.

528
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:48,771
我现在匀不出精力
A present, I cannot afford energy

529
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:51,762
来消化食物
and nerve force for digestion.

530
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:56,319
嗳 如果你还想继续调查这件案子就得吃啊
Well, you must if you intend to pursue this case.

531
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:58,197
我感觉 我的朋友
I feel,my dear fellow,

532
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,040
这件案子将不光彩地以雷斯垂德
that our case will end ingloriously

533
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,754
吊死咱们的委托人来结束
by Le Strade hanging our client,

534
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:07,833
这对苏格兰场无疑会成为一次胜利
which will certainly be atriumph for Scotland Yard.

535
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,406
来了一份电报
There's a telegram.

536
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,511
新获重要证据
Important fresh evidence at hand,

537
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,016
麦克法兰罪行已定
McFarland's guilt definitely established,

538
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:32,703
奉劝放弃此案 雷斯垂德
advise you to abandoncase, Le Strade.

539
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:37,712
这是雷斯垂德自鸣得意的小胜利
It is Le Strade's little cockle-doodle of victory.

540
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,948
我们先吃早饭吧
Let's have some breakfast,

541
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:21,192
然后一块出去看看有什么可做的
and then go out together and see what we can do.

542
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,201
今天我觉得需要你的陪伴
I feel as if I shall need your company

543
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:28,392
和精神援助
and moral support today.

544
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,566
啊 福尔摩斯先生 华生医生
Ah, Mr. Holmes,Dr. Watson.

545
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:46,306
我想这次你们得承认
I think you will acknowledge

546
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,505
我们走在你前头了
that we're just a little in front of you this time.

547
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:55,836
请到这边来 先生们
Step this way, if you please, gentlemen,

548
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:58,306
我想我能彻底说服你们
and I'm sure I can convince you

549
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:00,463
约翰・麦克法兰
that it was John McFarland

550
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:02,202
就是本案的真凶
who committed this crime.

551
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:05,889
我们都讨厌自己是错的那一方
I don't like being wrong anymore than the rest of us do.

552
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:07,628
但是 一个人总不能
Still, a man can't always

553
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:10,167
指望事事如意
expect to have it his own way,

554
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:12,150
是不是这样 华生医生?
can he Dr. Watson?

555
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,264
这就是女管家放置
This is where the housekeeper left

556
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:26,863
麦克马兰先生手杖的地方
McFarland's hatand stick,

557
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:28,812
也是他作案之后必定过来
and this is also where he would have come

558
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,699
拿回自己帽子的地方
to collect his hat after the crime was committed.

559
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,551
现在看看这个
Now, look at this.

560
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:36,882
一个大拇指纹
A thumb mark.

561
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,274
正如我观察到的
So I observe.

562
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:40,534
带血的大拇指纹
A thumb mark in blood.

563
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:43,352
你知道大拇指的指纹没有两个同样的
You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?

564
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:45,891
我听说过类似这样的话
I have heard something of the kind.

565
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,936
一模一样
Identical.

566
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:06,171
这是今天早上从麦克法兰手上取来的
And that was taken from McFarland this morning.

567
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,345
绝对是同一个大拇指印出来的
Definitely the same thumb mark.

568
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,501
这是决定性的
And that is final.

569
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:16,536
是决定性的
Quite final.

570
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,796
是谁作出这个惊人的发现的?
Who made this discovery?

571
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,849
是女管家勒克辛顿太太
It was Mrs. Lexington here

572
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,527
告诉我的警士的
who drew my Constable's attention to it.

573
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:26,136
我想
And, I suppose,

574
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:28,193
很可能这血迹昨天就在墙上吧?
there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?

575
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,867
嗳 当然麦克法兰会深夜
Well, of course McFarland could have crept out

576
00:42:30,971 --> 00:42:32,884
从监狱里跑出来
of jail in the middle of the night

577
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,354
增加对自己不利的证据
just to strengthen the evidence against himself.

578
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:36,989
哈哈
Ha-ha.

579
00:42:37,128 --> 00:42:40,780
你不会反对我到楼上转转吧?
Have you any objection if I take a stroll upstairs?

580
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:42,727
不 请便
No, none at all.

581
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,580
可是上面什么都没有
There's nothing up there, though.

582
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,245
情况看起来很不利 福尔摩斯
So many things look so bad, Holmes.

583
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,332
但这个证据中有一个十分严重的缺陷
But there is a serious flaw in this new evidence.

584
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,558
什么缺陷?
What's that?

585
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:14,667
昨天我检查门厅的时候
That thumb print was not there

586
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:16,960
墙上并没有血指纹
when I examined the hall yesterday.

587
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,750
雷斯垂德警官
Inspector Le Strade,

588
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,750
我觉得你的证据不充足
I cannot help thinking your evidence is incomplete.

589
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:39,811
你是什么意思呢 福尔摩斯先生?
What do you mean,Mr. Holmes?

590
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,620
我只是要说有一个重要的证人
Merely that there is an important witness

591
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,463
你还没有见到
that you have not yet seen.

592
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:45,898
你能引见一下这位证人吗?
You can produce this witness, can you?

593
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,546
我想我能
I think I can.

594
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,029
那么 请让他出来吧
Well then, do so.

595
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:50,977
我尽力而为
I'll do my best.

596
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:54,010
你有几个警士?
How many Constables have you?

597
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,116
能马上召集来的有三个
Three within call.

598
00:44:55,742 --> 00:44:57,133
好极了
Excellent.

599
00:44:57,238 --> 00:44:59,707
他们都是体型健壮
I assume that they are able-bodied,

600
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,003
声音洪亮的大个子吧?
large men with powerful voices?

601
00:45:02,143 --> 00:45:04,415
他们当然是
No doubt that they are,yeah.

602
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:09,969
外面的小屋里有一大堆麦秸
In the outhouse, there is a quantity of straw.

603
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,229
请你们搬两捆进来
I would like two bundles brought in.

604
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,246
麦秸?
Straw?

605
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:19,604
再提两桶水
And two buckets of water.

606
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,795
水?
Water?

607
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:24,195
把东西都带到顶层平台上
Ask them to bring it to the top landing.

608
00:45:33,452 --> 00:45:37,587
麦秸放进壁炉 往前一点
Straw, into the fireplace,a little bit in front.

609
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:41,204
两桶水放到那边 警官
Two buckets of water to that side, Constable.

610
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:43,361
福尔摩斯先生!
Mr. Holmes!

611
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,109
我不知道你是不是在跟我们开玩笑
I don't know whether you'replaying a game with us,

612
00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:49,028
可以照直跟我们说 不用故弄玄虚
but surely tell us without all this tom-foolery.

613
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,708
我向你保证 雷斯垂德
I can assure you,Le Strade,

614
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:52,596
我做每件事都有完全理由的
I have an excellent reason for everything that I do.

615
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:55,779
华生 你点着麦秸好吗?
Watson, would you put a match to that straw?

616
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,457
警官 到时麻烦你用水把火扑灭好吗?
And Constable, will you sprinkle it with water?

617
00:46:19,258 --> 00:46:22,075
现在 我们来看看
Now, we must see

618
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,119
能不能给你找出那个证人来 雷斯垂德
if we can find this witness for you, Le Strade.

619
00:46:27,224 --> 00:46:29,867
先生们
Gentlemen,

620
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:37,275
你们跟我一起大喊着火 好吗 ?
would you please join meand we'll call a fire ...

621
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,433
一 二 三 "着火啦!"
one, two three ...FIRE!

622
00:46:39,537 --> 00:46:40,511
"着火啦!"
Fire.

623
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,633
我们还能喊得更大声一点
We can do better than that.

624
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:45,242
一起敞开嗓门大喊吧
Full voice,and together.

625
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:46,773
"着火啦!"
FIRE!

626
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:01,938
天哪
Good heavens,

627
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,564
警官 拿一桶水洒在麦秸上吧
Constable, a bucket of water on that straw.

628
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,520
雷斯垂德 请允许我向你介绍
Le Strade, allow me to present you

629
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:13,347
这就是本案失踪的重要证人 约纳斯・奥德克先生
with your missing principal witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.

630
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:16,270
这是怎么回事?
What's this then?

631
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:19,122
你这些时候在干什么?
What have you been doing all this time?

632
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:20,965
我没有害人
I've done no harm.

633
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,565
没害人?
NO harm!

634
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,096
你想尽一切办法
You've only done your best

635
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,182
要把一个无辜的人送上绞架
to get an innocent man hanged.

636
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:28,617
要不是有这位先生的话
If it wasn't for this gentleman standing here,

637
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:31,261
说不定你就得逞了
I'm not sure you wouldn't have succeeded.

638
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,035
把他带下去!
Take him!

639
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:37,627
让咱们看看这只耗子之前躲在什么地方
Let us see where this rat has been lurking.

640
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,855
这就是做建筑师的有利条件
Now you see the advantage of being a builder,

641
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:48,410
能给自己打造一个隐秘的藏身之所
he was able to fix up his own little hiding place

642
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,219
而不需要任何人帮手
without any confederate,

643
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:52,410
当然他那个女管家除外
save for that precious housekeeper of his,

644
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:55,575
我应该马上把她也放进你的猎囊 巡官
whom I should lose no time in adding to your bag, Inspector.

645
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,602
这些就是遗失的字据吧?
And these are the missing papers, no doubt?

646
00:47:58,706 --> 00:48:00,758
显然如此
No doubt what so ever.

647
00:48:00,863 --> 00:48:03,193
警官 把女管家找来
Constable, find the housekeeper.

648
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,871
你是怎么想到这个地方的 福尔摩斯先生?
How did you know about that place, Mr. Holmes?

649
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:08,097
当我对比这个房间
When I compared the proportions of this room

650
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:10,184
和楼下房间的比例时
with those of the room below,

651
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:13,663
我推测壁炉的墙是假的
I deduced that this fireplace wall was false.

652
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:16,864
奥德克虽然胆量过人
Oldacre clearly had a great deal of nerve,

653
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:18,880
但却没有足够勇气
but little enough,I've found,

654
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:20,829
能在火警面前呆着不动
to like quiet before an alarm of fire.

655
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:29,525
但是你究竟是怎么知道
How in the world did you know

656
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:30,776
他藏在屋里的呢?
that he was in the house at all?

657
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,237
那枚拇指印 雷斯垂德
The thumb mark,Le Strade.

658
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,221
我昨天检查大厅的时候 墙上确实什么都没有
When I examined the hall yesterday, it was clear.

659
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,168
因此 指印是后来在夜里按上去的
Therefore, it must have been put there during the night.

660
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:37,420
怎么按上去的呢?
But how?

661
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,116
当晚麦克法兰检查字据后
After McFarland had examined the papers that night,

662
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:43,681
封存字据
he resealed them.

663
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,360
那样就在封蜡上留下了姆指纹
To do so, he used his thumb upon the wax.

664
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,004
在密室盘算一切的时候
Brooding in that den of his,

665
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:51,230
奥德克灵机一动
it suddenly struck Oldacre

666
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:53,908
想到可以好好利用那枚指纹
what use he could make of that thumbprint.

667
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,622
在蜡模上抹上血迹
Smearing the wax with a little blood,

668
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:58,917
以此制造出足以证明
he made what appeared to be absolutely

669
00:48:59,057 --> 00:49:01,769
麦克法兰有罪的确证
damning evidence against McFarland.

670
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:06,255
但他制造这个大骗局的苦心是什么呢?
But what was the object of his deception?

671
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:07,960
你看 是这么回事 警官
Ah, well,you see Inspector,

672
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,875
为了骗过那些紧追不放的
in order to swindle his creditors,

673
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:11,787
所有债主
who were pressing him,

674
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:14,291
奥德克通过给某柯尼利亚斯先生开出大额支票的方式
Oldacre emptied his bank account by paying out

675
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:17,143
清空了自己的银行帐户
several large sums to acertain Mr. Cornelius.

676
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:19,127
现在我可以认定奥德克先生
Now, I have no doubt that Messers Oldacre

677
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:21,283
和柯尼利亚斯先生是同一个人
and Cornelius are one and the same person,

678
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:23,996
改名换姓的目的
the object being to change his name,

679
00:49:24,136 --> 00:49:26,744
就是取出所有款项 然后销声匿迹
draw on the money,and then vanish.

680
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:29,562
我们所面对的 是一个
We see before us a very deep,

681
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:32,275
非常恶毒 报复心强的人
malicious and vindictive man.

682
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,014
你是否知道麦克法兰的母亲
Did you know that he was once refused

683
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:36,553
从前拒绝过他的求婚?
by McFarland's mother?

684
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:39,684
他终其一生都渴望报复
All his life, he has longed for vengeance.

685
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:41,563
假如能让人误认为
If he could give the impression

686
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:42,814
他是被旧情人的
that he was murdered

687
00:49:42,954 --> 00:49:45,006
独子谋杀了
by the only child of his former sweetheart,

688
00:49:45,145 --> 00:49:47,406
还有比这更好的报复方式吗?
what more better revenge?

689
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:49,807
我绝对不会允许有任何实质性伤害
I would never have allowed any real harm

690
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,476
发生在麦克法兰先生身上
to befall poor Mr. McFarland,

691
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,484
我向你保证
I assure you.

692
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,432
那要留待陪审团来决定
That's for the jury to decide.

693
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:56,693
你要控告我?
You're charging me?

694
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,049
为了一个恶作剧?
For a joke?

695
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,823
只不过是一个恶作剧而已
It's nothing more than a practical joke.

696
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,807
这可是 谋杀啊...
It's nothing less than murder ...

697
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,380
记得火灾里的尸体吗
the body in the fire.

698
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:09,111
那是谁的尸体?
But whose body was it?

699
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:11,060
一个老海员 雷斯垂德
And old sailor,Le Strade,

700
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:13,355
一个时运不济的人
who had fallen upon hard times.

701
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:15,476
我在检查火灾留下来的灰烬时
When I examined the ashes of that fire,

702
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:21,773
发现你的专家们漏掉了这个
I discovered that your experts had missed this.

703
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:27,756
一只尖利的白色牙齿
It is a tooth of the great white shark,

704
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:31,234
你能看到它上面有轻微雕琢过的痕迹
and you see that it has been lightly carved.

705
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:34,608
显然是海员的随身装饰物
It is typical of the work carried out by seamen.

706
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:37,669
但这并不足以证明
Well, this isn't evidence enough

707
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,790
在火灾里丧命的就是他
to show who died in the fire.

708
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,765
我很确定周一
I know for certain that on Monday,

709
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:46,295
谋杀案发生的前一天
the day before the murder,

710
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,835
一个流浪汉来过这里
a tramp called at this house.

711
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:52,069
然而 我盘问女管家的时候
Yet, when I questioned the housekeeper,

712
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,113
她向我保证
she assured me

713
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,791
这里绝不可能欢迎流浪汉
that no such tramp would ever be welcome.

714
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:58,991
但实际上不但好好接待了那个流浪汉
Not only was his reception welcoming,

715
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:01,948
还把奥德克先生的几件旧衣服给他了
but the man received some of Oldacre's clothing.

716
00:51:02,053 --> 00:51:05,183
昨天在前门附近
Yesterday,near the front gate,

717
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:08,105
我发现了他留下了的记号
I found the calling card that he left,

718
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:11,131
用暗号通知流浪的同伴
a coded sign advising his fellow travelers

719
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,513
这里有慷慨的施舍
of a charitable welcome.

720
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:14,556
昨天晚上
And last night,

721
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:16,070
在你手下的本地警士帮助下
with the help of your local Constable,

722
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:20,348
我和其中一个流浪者谈过
I talked to one of these fellow travelers,

723
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:22,436
他说那个不幸的海员
who said that the unfortunate seaman

724
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,113
第二天又被请回去了
had been asked to call back the following day

725
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,002
说会有更殷勤的款待
with the assurance of further hospitality.

726
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:32,106
因此 之后那天早上
And so,the next morning,

727
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,783
他穿着新衣服
wearing his new clothes,

728
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:39,515
至少是穿着新裤子 折返那里...
or at least his new trousers, he returned ...

729
00:51:39,655 --> 00:51:42,263
从此再也没有人见过他
and was never seen again.

730
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:45,950
你拯救了一个无辜人的性命 福尔摩斯先生
You've saved an innocent man's life, Mr. Holmes.

731
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:49,707
还挽救了我 给我免去了一场丑闻
You've also saved me some embarrassment.

732
00:51:49,846 --> 00:51:52,768
啊 我的好兄弟
Ah, my good chap!

733
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:54,364
你会发现自己
You will find that your reputation

734
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:55,510
在此案后名声大振
has been enormously enhanced.

735
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:57,534
只要把你写的报告
Just make a few alterations to that report

736
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:59,065
稍加改动
which you are writing,

737
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,908
他们就会觉得想要蒙骗
and they will understand how hard it is

738
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:04,152
雷斯垂德巡官的眼睛有多么难啊
to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Le Strade.

739
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,530
你不希望报告中有你的名字?
You don't want your name to appear?

740
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,516
一点也不
Not at all.

741
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,495
工作本身就是奖赏
His work is its own reward.

742
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,804
我会等着看你上绞架的!
I'll see you hang for this!

743
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:23,932
这话该是我说的
That privilege must surely be mine.

744
