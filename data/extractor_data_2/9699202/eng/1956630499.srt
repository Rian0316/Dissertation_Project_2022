No.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,840
It's not you, it's me.
I have something called vaginismus.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,600
My vagina's like a Venus flytrap.

12

If it makes you feel any better,
I've got one hairy nipple.

Can you cure it, the vaginismus?

Do you know why you have it?

I think it's because
I put too much pressure on myself.

I think your overreaction
to this situation

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,080
stems from your deep-rooted fear
of rejection.

You've rejected Jakob,

You didn't exactly accept Jakob.

In fact, you made it

So, is your son's inability to form
an attachment with your ex-boyfriend

No.

You don't invoice
for a casual conversation.

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
Thank you.

176
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
For what? Where are you going?

177
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,640
[Miss Sands] Remember, guys,
today is about having fun. Cube away, Dex!

178
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,400
But it's also really important
that we win.

179
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,520
This is not a drill, guys.
This is the endgame.

180
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Understood?

181
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,880
Wait. I made these for you.

182
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh. Thanks, Aimes.

183
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,080
- What's with the rogue "R"?
- I had an extra cupcake.

184
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Oh, thanks.

185
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360
It's a picture of your face
when it's concentrating.

186
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,680
Good luck. See you there.

187
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
Is she trying to tell me something?

188
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah, I think she's saying,
"I still love you, Steve,

189
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
but I need some more time."

190
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,160
- [knock at door]
- [door opens]

191
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Mum said to call
if you want anything else.

192
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,560
- All right, bye.
- How is your mother?

193
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,200
Do you think she misses me?

194
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't know, Dad.

195
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
I think Madam misses you though.

196
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
[chuckles]

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
I was thinking
I could come back to school.

198
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,520
I know I've missed out on a lot,
but I want to find something I'm good at.

199
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want to work in that shop forever.

200
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,640
[sighs]

201
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
Well, you haven't been fired yet.

202
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
Wonders never cease.

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,240
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's see, shall we?

204
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
Adam, you can go now.

205
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,120
Adam! Get out!

206
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Hi, Adam.

208
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
How are you?

209
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,800
My mum's divorcing my dad,
so he's sleeping in the school.

210
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah, everyone kind of knows. [chuckles]

211
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
I got fired from my job.

212
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,200
Yeah. [chuckles] Rahim told me.

213
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Sorry, man.

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Still play the French horn?

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
I didn't think you knew what it was.
[laughs]

216
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
Trombone sounded funny.

217
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,920
- [man] Eric, we're starting.
- [chuckles]

218
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,720
It's the final rehearsal
for the musical tonight.

219
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,440
[bell ringing]

220
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
You should come. I mean,

221
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
- I'm sure musicals aren't your ting, but...
- Is it like <i>Frozen?</i>

222
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
Because that was very sad.

223
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Yeah. Uh... [laughs]
It's a bit like <i>Frozen.</i>

224
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
It...

225
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,640
kind of looks like they're snogging
in a forest full of dicks.

226
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
[Eric] That's exactly what I said!

227
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,320
[Eric, laughing]
It's a forest full of dicks, man!

228
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,160
- It's full of dicks!
- It's just mad.

229
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
[Eric laughing]

230
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,400
- I, uh... I better go.
- [Eric chuckles]

231
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah. Um...

232
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,200
I...
I didn't mean what I said at the party...

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,760
about people not liking you.

234
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm very easy to not like.

235
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
[sighs]

236
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
I, uh...

237
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
I understand that I hurt you.

238
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay.

239
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
I just wanted you to know that.

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,240
[doctor] <i>What makes you think
you are perimenopausal?</i>

241
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Well, I've been feeling very tired
and sort of heavy.

242
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
And I've had this intermittent tight...

243
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
feeling around my chest.

244
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,600
And, um, have there been
any big life changes recently?

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Well, yes.
I've, um, had some trouble at work,

246
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,280
and, uh, well, my teenage son is...

247
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
Well, he's a teenager.

248
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
And things ended with a man I was seeing
but, you know,

249
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,200
just ordinary, manageable life stuff.

250
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,400
When did you break up with your partner?

251
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,160
Uh, he wasn't my partner,
and I didn't break up with him.

252
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,520
I... Well, I might have pushed him away.

253
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Um...

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
And then I realized my mistake, and...

255
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,440
I tried to make it right,
but apparently, it was too late.

256
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Oh.

257
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
There's the feeling.

258
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,200
And did this pain start
when this man broke things off with you?

259
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,160
I mean, I'd... Yes, I might have noticed
the symptoms around that time, but...

260
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
[inhales deeply]

261
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,960
...perimenopause causes
surges in adrenaline, right? And...

262
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
I think you might be suffering from
a broken heart.

263
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Well, that's ridiculous.

264
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm a sex and relationship therapist,
I'm sure I'd know if I was...

265
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,360
suffering from a broken heart.

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
And I've been a GP for over 20 years
and not long ago,

267
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
I was hospitalized for a kidney infection
I didn't think I had.

268
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Right.

269
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,320
Let's get some tests done
and put your mind at ease.

270
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
[Remi] <i>"The modern man is now lacking
a sense of pride</i>

271
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,440
in his innate masculinity.

272
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,320
How do we reclaim that pride?

273
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,240
I believe it starts
with taking ownership of ourselves.

274
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,600
How can we ever begin
a romantic relationship

275
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,160
without first owning our own emotions?
The answer is...

276
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,840
we can't. The first rule of owning oneself
is to live in the moment

277
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,520
and practice the power

278
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,560
of intention."

279
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Thank you.

280
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
This guy is so full of shit.

281
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
Thanks.

- Ben.

00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Ben.

- Hey, Dad.

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Otis, uh, shouldn't you be in school?

286
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,280
Yeah, I was, um... I was hoping
we could talk about something.

287
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,720
Yeah, of course.
Just take a seat for half an hour. Yeah.

288
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,680
- Could I grab a photograph, Dr. Milburn?
- Yes. Of course.

289
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
- [girl] Brilliant, thank you.
- [Remi] Thank you.

Good job. Thank you very much.

Hey, Erin. Erin, have you seen
my pet rabbit? It's gone missing.

294
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,800
- No, I've not seen him.
- It's a her, actually.

295
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
Did you know that female rabbits
are called does, and...

296
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,800
- male rabbits are called bucks?
- No, didn't know that.

297
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,360
- Yeah. It's all in this book called...
- I'm in a bit of a rush.

- That's weird.

I could have swore I locked that.

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
Fuck.

302
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now...

303
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,920
Hope you find your rabbit.

304
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,000

Yeah, it's my mother. [sniffs]

The release of Dr. Milburn's notes
was quite serious.

I can assure you we have the situation
completely under control.

323
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,920
Ms. Milburn has been removed from campus,
and our students are no longer at risk.

324
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
She was on campus to help us protect
our students.

325
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,480
You managed to somehow make
a dire situation worse.

326
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,040
That was an unfortunate blip.

348
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
Let's get straight down to it
with a round on Art History.

349
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,680
So, question one...

350
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,080
[Remi] Here you go, one lemonade.

351
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
So...

352
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,560
what's this all about then, son?

353
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,280
More girl trouble?

354
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,120
Why did you leave...

355
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
when I was a kid?

356
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
Oh, your... your mother and I
were unhappy, and...

357
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,120
Not why did you leave Mum,
why did you leave me?

358
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
What's this really about?

359
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
This is what this is really about, Dad.

360
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,040
I thought everything was Mum's fault.

361
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,680
That she was the reason I feel...

362
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
confused.

363
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,640
But at least she's there for me.

364
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,080
Where were you?

365
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Well, I-I had to move to America
for work...

366
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,560
No, you moved to America for yourself.

367
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,160
Dad, please just stop lying.

368
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,400
Hey, I have a feeling
there might be some...

369
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
some inner conflict going on here.

370
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes, I feel angry...

371
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,280
all the time, and I'm trying to find out
what kind of man I want to be,

372
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,080
which is really hard when my dad
has been absent for most of my life.

373
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,000
Did you not like me
as much as you thought you would?

374
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,040
Of course I like you. I just...

375
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
Then how could you leave me?

376
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
[sighs]

377
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,480
Because I'm an arsehole.

378
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,400
I'm sure there are multiple ways
of diagnosing my personality,

379
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,320
but the chief ingredient is arsehole.

380
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
How do I not become an arsehole?

381
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Just try and stay honest.

382
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,240
'Cause once you start lying, it's...

383
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,120
it's very hard to stop.

384
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,920
You know, when you're young...

385
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,200
you think that everybody out there
really... really gets you.

386
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
But, you know, actually,

387
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
only a handful of them do.

388
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,160
All the people who like you,
despite your faults.

389
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,160
And then if you discard them,
they will never come back.

390
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
So, when you meet those people...

391
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,120
you should just hold on to them.

392
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,560
Really, really tightly.

393
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,760
And don't let them go.

395
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,120

never read this fucking book.

that our NSQC UK champions of the year,
with a score of 89 to 88 are...

518
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,000
- the Quiz Heads!
- Yes!

519
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
[audience screaming, cheering]

520
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Whoa!

521
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,720
Congratulations.

522
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
Thank you.

523
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,800
Didn't think you could make it.

524
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,360
I can get another job interview,
I wasn't gonna miss this.

525
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,616
- Mum, listen, I need to...
- No. No, come on.

526
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,960
I'll treat you to a strawberry milkshake
on the way home. Come on.

527
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
- Maybe we could hang out tonight?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

528
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
I don't think I want to have sex yet.

529
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,600
We don't have to have sex ever again,
I just miss talking to you.

530
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
It's gonna be so cringe.

531
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
- Hey, Viv. Are you coming too?
- Where?

532
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,360
To watch Jackson Marchetti
make an absolute tit of himself.

533
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
That's not funny.

534
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,720
- [sighs] Come on. He's an idiot jock.
- He's not an idiot.

535
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,160
He's trying something new
that he might not be very good at,

536
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
which is brave.

537
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,560
Whereas you do one thing really well,
and you never shut up about it.

538
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,680
[chuckles] If you're referring to
my Rubik's cube, I don't just do it well,

539
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,680
- I'm actually the 28th best...
- We know, Dex, we know.

540
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,200
We do kind of know, man.

541
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,640
- Half an hour until curtain, guys.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

542
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,960
Elbow, elbow, up, down,
twist, twist, up, down,

543
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,680
and pop it, and pop it.
Not at me, I'm faculty.

544
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
You got a problem, Quentin?

545
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm surprised you came, Ms. Milburn.

546
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
I still have a child
at the school, Mr. Groff.

547
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm here as a parent.

548
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm so proud of you, Froggy.

549
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
- Don't say that.
- No, I'm serious.

550
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,360
I know I've messed up so much,
and missed so many things,

551
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
but I'm never losing you again.

552
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
What's going on?

553
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
We're with Social Services.

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,240
There's been a report of drug use
in the presence of a minor.

555
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,200
Who reported it? Did you do this?

556
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,640
I didn't know they were coming.

557
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
Someone's reported something,
haven't they? And it's bullshit.

558
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,920
It's not bullshit, Mum.

559
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,880
You did this?

560
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,440
I know you've been using again,
so don't lie.

561
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
She's not safe.

562
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,600
I slipped... once.

563
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
It was a mistake.

564
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm in a program, they can help me.

565
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,640
- You can't take my kid.
- We're not taking her anywhere,

566
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,856
we need to look inside the caravan
if that's all right.

567
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,256
- Stay away from my caravan!
- I'm sure we can sort this out,

568
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
- but we need to have a look inside.
- Mum!

569
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,280
We'll have to call the police
if you make a scene.

570
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,496
- Let them look inside...
- Stay the fuck away from me!

571
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't touch me!

572
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,600
How could you?

573
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
How could you do this to me?

574
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Here. [laughs]

575
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Here.

576
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,400
You take her things.

577
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
You say you're not going to take her...

578
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
but you're lying.

579
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,520
You're fucking lying.

580
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
There's a hostile resident
not cooperating.

581
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
We need assistance.

582
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,200
- I don't know if I need a bow tie.
- You look very nice.

583
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
Nice suit.

584
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, she's all dressed up
for her new girlfriend.

585
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,000
Shut up, Dad.

586
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
Well, what's the problem?
I thought you were broken up with him.

587
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah, I'm kind of dating Lily now.

588
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,360
I didn't want to make it awkward.

589
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
It's not awkward.

590
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,320
That's... That's great.

591
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
Young people are strange, so, come on.

592
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,480
Actually, could I have a...

593
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,440
I wanted to apologize properly

594
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,520
for making things difficult
between you and my mum.

595
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,080
I found not being her number one priority
harder than I expected.

596
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,440
It was very immature of me.

597
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,360
Sorry for being an arsehole.

598
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah...

599
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,600
you are a bit of an arsehole.

600
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
But you're also a good man, Otis.

601
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Do you think so?

602
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I know so.

603
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
Shall we?

604
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats</i>

605
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage
to the planet of Verona.</i>

606
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,120
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

607
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats</i>

608
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,960
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage
to the planet of Verona.</i>

609
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,720
[moaning]

610
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,440
I thought this was Shakespeare?

611
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,520
Uh, yes. I think our students are taking
a postmodern approach.

612
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,600
Stand by.

613
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,000
[instrumental music playing]

614
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,520
- Sorry.
- Sir, I can't go on stage.

615
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,560
- I'm gonna humiliate myself.
- Jackson, babe.

616
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,520
- You're not a great actor...
- Yeah.

617
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
...yet.

618
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,016
The most important thing is
you're doing something you enjoy.

619
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,801
Maybe you're not nervous at all.
Maybe you're just super-duper pumped.

620
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
Okay? Doosh, doosh.

621
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
- It's not in there, is it?
- No.

622
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Enter Carl.

623
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,080
[grunting]

624
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,560
Two households, both alike in dignity,

625
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,480
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

626
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,280
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

627
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,840
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

628
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,360
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes,

629
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,360
a pair of star-crossed lovers

630
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
take their life.

631
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,360
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

632
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Mum...

633
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,280
Mum, please talk to me. Come on.

634
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,800
I will never forgive you.

635
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Never.

636
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,840
Come on, darling.

637
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,360
- You look nice, Mum.
- Something new I'm trying.

638
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,880
Is everything all right at school?

639
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,040
How was your father?

640
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Not good.

641
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Maybe we could...

642
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,200
let him come back?

643
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
Oh, darling.

644
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,360
Your father needed to fight for us
a very long time ago.

645
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
What do you mean?

646
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
[sighs] When you love a person,

647
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,320
there's always a tiny part of you
that's terrified that one day

648
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,720
you're gonna lose them.

649
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,480
And I think that your father's so scared
of that emotion that...

650
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,240
he stops himself feeling anything at all.

651
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,480
But you have to let the people you love
know that you love them,

652
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,240
even if it causes you
a great deal of pain.

653
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Why?

654
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
It sounds awful.

655
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,200
Because you're alive.

656
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I have to go.

657
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
[boy] See...

658
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
where he comes.

659
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,960
So please you, step aside.
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.

660
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,760
Come, madam. Let's away.

661
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,520
- Shit.
- [boy] Good morrow, cousin!

662
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Fuck.

663
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,960
Good morrow, cousin!

664
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,480
Colin, does anyone have eyes on Jackson?

665
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,640
- Jackson, that's your cue.
- [Quentin] I'll go back on.

666
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,880
I know all the lines.

667
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,640
Shut the fuck up, Quentin,
you piece of shit. Jesus Christ.

668
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,040
- [boy] Good morrow, cousin!
- Get on stage, now!

669
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,376
And remember, you're not nervous,
you're just excited. Go!

670
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Sir!

671
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,560
[audience murmuring]

672
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,160
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

673
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,760
Get on with it!

674
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
[laughter]

675
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,240
[sighs]

676
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,760
Good morrow, cousin!

677
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,880
[whispering] Is the day so young?

678
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,440
[boy 2] Get back in the pool, Marchetti.

679
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
[audience laughing]

680
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Uh...

681
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,440
[Bev, whispering] Jackson.

682
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,400
Is the day so young?

683
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,920
Is the day so young?

684
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,360
Is the day so young?

685
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,520
[ironic cheering, scattered applause]

686
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,920
[boy]
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

687
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,920
- Remember the heartbeats.
- What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

688
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,040
Uh, I am out of her favor,
where I am in love.

689
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,680
Alas, she is too fair, too wise.

You did the right thing.

Do you want to come in?
I'll make you an omelet.

875

879
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,920
You don't even have milk.

880
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,360
Do I look like someone
who regularly pops to the shops?

881
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,320
Okay, I'll go get some stuff.

Maeve's not there.

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
Oh.

887
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,680
Do you know when she'll be back?

888
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Can't be sure.

00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
[sighs]

890
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,320
Could you let her know that I was here?

891
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
And...

892
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,360
tell her to check her messages.

893
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
