1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,530
Okay, Max.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,630
How would you describe our apartment?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,040
And I've already ruled out

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,300
worse than that girl-pit
in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,040
Well, at least she had some
silence once in a while.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,250
Look, no one's gonna pay
money to rent this dump.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,450
We haven't in six months.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,320
Everyone else in
Williamsburg is making money

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,690
renting their crappy places on Airbnb.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,250
It's all how you describe it.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,190
So let's start lying.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,160
This is a fantastic idea
and I really want to do this.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,760
First question: "Describe
your neighborhood."

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,830
Run-down with a bunch of rats.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,910
Old-world charm.
Pet-friendly.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,840
"What type of people live there?"

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,140
Junkies, whores, homeless.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,910
Actors.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
"Do you have a hot tub?"

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,420
Sometimes.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,420
"Gym?"

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,620
Two. Gay Jim upstairs,

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,960
and straight Jim across the hall

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,430
who's only gay when he's drunk.

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,460
"When is your space available?

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,160
Always, sometimes, one time."

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,960
Oh, just like our sex lives.

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,300
Always for me, sometimes out of boredom,

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,200
and one time for you.

Earl, guess what Max and I did.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,490
I know what you didn't do.

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,130
Clean this dessert carousel.

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,660
There's a Napoleon in
here since Napoleon.

38
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,400
We rented our apartment on Airbnb.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,100
You rented to Arabs?

40
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,870
Well, good luck getting it back.

41
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,480
They tend to be a tad territorial.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,710
Airbnb is an agency that
rents to out-of-towners

43
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,050
and I'm guessing local men
cheating on their wives.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,820
Well, I did it.

45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,890
I know.

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,060
When you were 18 with Prince Harry.

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,960
Or so you say.

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,090
We have three offers for our apartment.

49
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,230
How?

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,530
Let me rephrase that.

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,660
How!

52
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,770
I found the perfect sales pitch.

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,170
"Stay at the place where dreams die"?

54
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,240
"Have the authentic
Williamsburg experience""

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,210
Oh, you mean getting clumsily felt up

56
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,710
by a guy who looks like
he came from the gold rush?

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,450
Anyone can stay at a hotel.

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,650
But how often can you
say you went to New York

59
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,690
and stayed at a "Brooklyn
bohemian barn apartment

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,720

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
Girl, you are good.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,330
So now we just have to
pick who gets our apartment.

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,730
A guy looking to get away from it all.

64
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,670
that's a suicide.

65
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,500
You're right. We lie, they lie.

66
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,300
Um, a married couple
looking to reconnect.

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,640
Murder-suicide.

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,740
And finally, a girls' getaway weekend

69
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,510
for some fashion model friends.

70
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,280
A couple of chubby
girls looking to murder

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,520
some pints of Ben and Jerry's.

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
With maybe a sui-side
of mac and cheese.

73
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,990
Hey, everybody.

74
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,490
Yeah, the temperature be droppin'

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,730
and the bitches be nippin'.

76
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,100
I need a hot chocolate.

77
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,570
I'm right here, Sophie.

78
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,140
And I'm right here, Earl.

79
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,710
I mean, I get it,

00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,940
but bro code, man.

81
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,240
Well, big news.

82
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,610
I'm going on a trip.

83
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,580
Mushrooms or acid?

84
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,590
I'm going to vermont!

85
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,220
Oh, you're gonna be gone?

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,860
Would you mind letting us
stay upstairs at your place?

87
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,420
We're renting out our apartment.

88
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,690
You're renting out that dump?

89
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,530
Oh, are they filming
<i>Survivor</i> at your place?

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,070
[coughing]

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,140
So when are these losers arriving?

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,680
They're not losers.

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,450
They're just girls paying
us to have a fun weekend

94
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,610
In our apartment.

95
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,880
What losers!

Hi, are you Caroline?

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,870
Oh, my God. They really are models.

100
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,870
Hi, I'm Lily.

101
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,370
Oh shoot, now I'm gay.

102
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,540
Lily? As in Lily Aldridge?

103
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,770
And I'm Martha.

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,940
Hunt? Martha Hunt and Lily Aldridge?

105
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,010
Max, do you know who they are?

106
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,410
Sure do.

107
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,480
This one is the girl
that I leave this one for.

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,150
No, Max, they're all
Victoria's Secret models.

109
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,720
Yeah, we all wanted
to hang out in New York

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,990
before we leave for London.

111
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,920
We're doing a fashion show there.

112
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,260
I worked at the Victoria's Secret
at the mall for one day.

113
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Got fired for eating panda
express over the thongs.

114
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,330
This is Max. I'm Caroline.

115
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,330
I used to be rich.

116
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,500
I just felt like I needed to say that.

117
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,940
And these are our friends,
Petra, Gabriella, and Rina.

118
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,980
(all three) Hi.

119
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,050
What are the odds you're all
named after Columbus's ships.

120
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,850
Come in. Welcome to
"The Williamsburg Experience."

121
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,520
It's bigger than it looks in the photo.

122
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,290
Well, I shaved of a couple
of inches for the photo.

123
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,830
You know the drill.

124
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,830
So why the hell are you staying here?

125
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,230
Is this training for
when your looks run out?

126
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,530
Oh, look. The kitchen is so cute!

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,510
Question: How do you
walk the runway blind?

128
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,710
It's just that we stay
at the same Four Seasons all the time.

129
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,410
Well, you will experience
at least two seasons here,

130
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,550
'cause the thermostat's broken.

131
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,680
It's 40 outside and 100 in here.

132
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,720
So as advertised, this is our sauna.

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,660
And our bohemian barn's
right out that door.

134
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,990
Just follow the temperature drop.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Max, super models are
staying at our apartment.

136
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,700
It's so exciting, I want
to tell all my friends.

137
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,570
I guess I just did.

138
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,040
I see you met Chestnut.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,210
That's his real mane, not extensions.

140
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,050
Also per our ad, a charming skylight.

141
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,710
In case you want to sit under the stars

142
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,290
and have a little peace and quiet.

143
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,320
Hey, girls!

144
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,560
Come up already.

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,090
I want to get to my college reunion.

146
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,760
can you believe it's been 10 years?

147
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,160
Wow, time sure does lie...

148
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,970
I mean, fly.

149
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,930
(Martha) You talk to your neighbors?

150
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
I talked to my neighbor once
and the next thing you know,

151
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,540
I have this long letter from Naomi Watts

152
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,140
saying, "leave my husband alone."

153
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,550
So we've known each other
like five minutes already.

154
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,150
Where's my free bra?

155
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,150
I mean, all that's left
of this one is the frames.

156
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,350
Trust me, it's like a
burlesque show under here.

157
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,190
Sophie's apartment is amazing.

158
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,130
It looks like an Easter bunny
banged a Golden Girl.

159
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,790
That was some showerhead.

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,900
I'd marry it, but it's
already attached...

161
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,830
to the wall.

162
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,780
Max?

163
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,540
Here!

164
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,480
Oh, this bed is like being in the womb

165
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,050
without all the second-hand smoke.

166
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,580
Martha and Lily were super-sweet.

167
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,750
So exciting to be back
hanging with celebrities.

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,260
Yeah, and maybe now you can
get a new celebrity story.

169
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,120
I was getting really tired
of hearing how someone thought

170
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,460
you were Gwyneth Paltrow from behind.

171
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,730
Still flattering.

172
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,930
[laughter]

173
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,940
Laughter?

174
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,770
Coming from our apartment?

175
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,410
What do you think they're laughing at?

176
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,010
Probably found our account
balance on an ATM slip.

177
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,940
I bet Martha said something funny.

178
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,350
She's hilarious.

179
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,710
You know, for someone who's so pretty,

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,320
she never had to develop a personality.

181
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,690
I'm gonna go see.

182
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,490
Max, give me a shove.

183
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,690
This is good practice
for the eventual cliff.

184
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,900
[indistinct chatter]

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,300
(Lily) Beers and wings.

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,770
(Martha) Beers and wings.

187
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,840
Now it's a party.

188
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,040
Max, you know how when
it gets hot down there,

189
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,840
we just sit, sweat, and
point the fan at our junk?

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,250
They do it a little differently.

191
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,150
They are dancing in their underwear,

192
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,650
drinking beers.

193
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,520
So? The guy on the corner
does that all the time.

194
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,690
[models toasting beers]

195
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
I can't take my eyes off those beers.

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,800
(lily) Hey! Hi, you guys.

197
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,510
(lily) you wanna come
down, and have some beers,

198
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,380
And cool off?

199
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,080
Be right down!

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,420
Now I wish I had those wings,
I could get down there faster.

201
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,590
Okay. So what is this big news?

202
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,160
Did the health inspector find out

203
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,730
that the imitation crab meat is cat?

204
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,570
Technically, it's imitation cat,

205
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,200
but that's not what we're announcing.

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,870
I'm here.

207
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,900
And make this snappy. I'm
in the middle of something.

208
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,840
Puberty?

209
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,510
No. I was on a call with
<i>Ripley's Believe It or Not</i>

210
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,280
to inform them that you still work here.

211
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,550
And they didn't believe it.

212
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,950
Okay. We have some friends
coming in for a meal

213
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,190
and we don't want you guys
to embarrass us and overreact.

214
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,160
Darlin', I don't overreact.

215
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,090
I'm 70-something years old
with a history of heart trouble.

216
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,230
I keep it in check.

217
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,300
Hey, Max!

218
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,240
And I keep my heart pills in my pocket.

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,570
Excuse me, much as I enjoy the view,

220
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,840
I really want that "100th
birthday" shout out

221
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,010
from Al Roker.

222
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,180
Yes, they're Victoria's Secret models
and our friends.

223
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,550
Last night we all stayed
up late trashing Kate Moss.

224
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,490
Models in my diner!

225
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,060
Oh, no. I wore the wrong sweater vest.

226
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,160
You also wore the wrong
face, body, and personality.

227
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,400
Max, let's go say hi.

228
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,430
How do I look?

229
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,100
Like a waitress.

230
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,600
Damn it, it's the
waitress uniform, isn't it?

231
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,800
What's up, homies?

232
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,810
What's up, homie?

233
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,810
I love my life again.

234
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,540
Well, it's been a
whole day since we met,

235
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,880
so where's that free bra?

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,350
Max!

237
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,550
What? This one's on it's last legs.

238
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,480
Last night I heard it coughing.

239
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,980
Could also use some new underwear.

240
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,350
Mine are running on fumes.

241
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,820
I just texted David.

242
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,460
He's coming.

243
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,590
This is going to be an amazing party.

244
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,790
- Party?
- Yeah.

245
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,260
We're having some friends over.

246
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,190
Cool.

247
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,100
And like Max said, "cool""

249
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,530
Jeez, pull it back.

250
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,970
You're acting needier than Sofia Vergara

251
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,970
on a red carpet.

252
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,370
Big fan.

253
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,140
Big, big fan.

254
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,680
Compliments of the chef.

255
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,620
My specialty, popsicles.

256
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,980
I find they taste best
when sucked slowly,

257
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,890
using plenty of tongue,
facing the kitchen.

258
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,350
I can't believe we're not invited

259
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,750
to the biggest party in our apartment

260
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,050
since those ants found your jelly beans.

261
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,590
Yoo-hoo!

262
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,020
Hi, so we're just up here hangin' out.

263
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,330
Doin' our thang.

264
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,200
(Lily) Oh, sorry, girl. Did we wake you?

265
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,570
Go back to sleep.

266
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,930
"Go back to sleep"?

267
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,740
Why does she think we're so lame?

268
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,400
Um, I don't know.

269
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,010
Maybe it's 'cause you're
throwing around words

270
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,540
like "yoo-hoo" and "thang,"
like a mom bringing cheetos

271
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,010
down to a slumber party.

272
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,410
This is your fault.

273
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
They were obsessed with
us until you started asking

274
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,790
for bras like some
bra-less homeless person.

275
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,360
We're never gonna sleep
with all that music.

276
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,490
Check the drawer, Sophie
must have ear plugs.

277
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,600
I mean, she lives upstairs from you.

278
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,470
I found plugs, but I don't
think they're for your ears.

279
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,670
It's fine, we'll just pop
downstairs and say hello.

280
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Fashion's my scene.

281
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,380
Know what I'm seeing? That price tag.

282
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,180
Oh, tuck it back in,
I have to return it.

283
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,920
Okay. Remember our deal.

284
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
I got up and got dressed
so you're my slave for life.

285
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, hi, girls.

286
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,690
I thought you were the
man with the Greek food.

287
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,660
Wow, I have definitely got to
start waxing my upper lip more.

288
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,930
Sophie, why aren't you in Vermont?

289
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,130
Oh, I lied.

290
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,700
I didn't go to vermont.

291
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,740
I mean, it's far and I'm not a lesbian.

292
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,280
No, I stayed in town to spy on Oleg.

293
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,110
I mean, I know you girls
think that I'm perfect,

294
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,750
but I have trust issues.

295
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,350
Well then, whose apartment is that?

296
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm staying at Jim's.

297
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,490
Straight Jim's or gay Jim's?

298
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,420
Sophie, you forgot your purse.

299
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,560
Oh, I think this is mine.

300
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,190
Just kidding, it's yours.

301
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,530
What's up, salt n' pepa?

302
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,830
(both) Gay Jim's.

303
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,310
Oh, girls, please don't
tell Oleg that I'm here.

304
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,840
You know, I've been following him around

305
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,940
to see what he would
do if I was not in town.

306
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,840
And so far, you know, he's been cool.

307
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,280
But you know the old saying:

308
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,820
"Cheat on me once, shame on you.

309
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,290
Cheat on me twice, your
balls are in a jar."

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,290
Oh, my God! There's a man
standing in our doorway.

311
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,290
I have a doorman again.

312
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,530
Weird to see a man
standing in our doorway

313
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,400
without a warrant, an eviction notice,

314
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,100
or a bible.

315
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,130
Excuse me, this is our apartment.

316
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,640
Yeah, we live here all the time.

317
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,200
No biggie.

318
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,140
No biggie, and no
electricity, no lease-y.

319
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,780
Hi, I'm Caroline. This is Max.

320
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
We live here.

321
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,650
Not according to the list.

322
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,120
Sir, look, we do live her. I have a key.

323
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,020
The key is to be on the
list, which you are not.

324
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,790
Okay, I can prove we live here.

325
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,560
Go over to the window,
kick the side of radiator,

326
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,390
a panel will open up.

327
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,600
You'll find a half-smoked joint
and another half-smoked joint.

328
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,860
Proving...

329
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,830
What? That you're a poor pot head?

330
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,500
This is crazy.

331
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,830
I can't believe I'm
begging to get into a place

332
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,240
I've been trying to get out of.

333
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,300
It's a very exclusive party.

334
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,570
It's a dump.

335
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,340
I should know. I live here.

336
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,080
(Caroline) This night
couldn't get any worse.

337
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,720
Turn that light off.

338
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,350
I'm watching the Vctoria's Secret
super model party

339
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,090
with my night vision goggles.

340
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,320
And updating.

341
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,290
Oleg, how did you get in here?

342
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,460
How do you think?

343
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,760
It's my girlfriend's apartment.

344
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,160
I broke in.

345
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,870
Yes, Oleg, it's your
girlfriend's apartment

346
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,630
where you're sitting in the dark,

347
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,740
watching models out the window
with night vision goggles.

348
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,670
Hey! My pants are on!

349
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,740
No, they are not!

350
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,210
Not my fault.

351
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,580
Five Victoria's Secret
super models downstairs?

352
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,020
They took themselves off.

353
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,850
So what are you saying?
You're the victim here?

354
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,420
What would Sophie say if she came home

355
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,790
and saw you sitting here?

356
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,090
She'd say, "stop
hogging the goggles."

357
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,960
Oleg, let me just say this:

358
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Vermont is closer than you think.

359
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,900
I don't know where
this argument is going,

360
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
but I'm going to that
damn supermodel party.

361
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,700
Oleg, it's late, I'm gonna
lay this on the line for you.

362
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,470
You're no George Clooney.

363
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,570
You're not even George Costanza.

364
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,310
These sheets are amazing

365
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,850
and you are never gonna
do better than Sophie.

366
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,850
She is hot and clearly
has no sense of smell.

367
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,820
I love Sophie.

368
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,660
I'll go home.

369
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,320
On second thought, I don't trust myself

370
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,690
to walk by your apartment.

371
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,190
Better lock me in here.

372
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,560
(Lily) Caroline! Max!
Come down here! Hurry!

373
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,800
I knew it! See, Max?

374
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,130
They're begging us to come.

375
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm back again.

376
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,770
Are you coming?

377
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh, let me think.

378
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,610
Downstairs with an open bar or up here,

379
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,180
alone, with Oleg in his
tighty-not-that-whities?

380
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,880
Should we tie you up?

381
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,850
No, it'll just make me hornier.

382
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,060
I knew they wanted us
to come to the party!

383
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,330
How could they not?

384
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,030
Last night I taught
Petra how to eat bread

385
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,300
without tearing it into
little pieces first.

386
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,900
Don't try it. I was a navy seal.

387
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,230
You think you're tough?

388
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,440
I lived in a refrigerator
box for a month.

389
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,740
With no top.

390
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,510
Not the box. Me.

391
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,480
(Lily) Max, Caroline, get in here!

392
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,580
Hey! See we were invited.

393
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,650
'cause we're "A" list.

394
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,420
The toilet is clogged and I need
you to take care of it, please.

395
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,460
"A list" as in "a" janitor list.

396
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,660
I don't know what to do.

397
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,690
Can one of you call the concierge?

398
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,760
Sure. Caroline!

399
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,460
Wait, wait, wait...
you didn't just call us

400
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,070
down here 'cause the
toilet's clogged, did you?

401
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,100
No.

402
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,270
Okay, good.

403
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,170
The kitchen sink is backed up, too.

404
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,810
But, toilet, I got this.

405
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,640
I was almost born in one.

406
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

407
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,950
All right, everyone just calm down.

408
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,250
No need to overreact.

409
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,360
And there's the pool
we mentioned in our ad.

410
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Oh, boy.

411
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Yup, we got some floaters.

412
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,890
Caroline, I'm gonna need the plunger

413
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,560
and a lobotomy.

414
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,700
This happens with vintage toilets.

415
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,170
Part of their old-world charm.

416
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,700
We got some charm stuck on your loofah.

417
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,910
Hey guys, remember last night

418
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,210
how we just bit into that bread

419
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,980
without chewing it? Good times.

420
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,810
I need that damn plunger, I
don't want to die this way.

421
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,920
Got it, but it's caught on something.

422
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,620
[grunts]

423
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,820
[screaming]

424
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,400
What kind of a dump is this?

425
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,030
Hey! You wanted
the Williamsburg Experience, this is it!

426
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,980
Good news, Martha. I have your flat iron

427
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,640
looking pretty much back to normal.

428
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,520
Oh, that's good. Keep it.

429
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,590
Again, sorry about your
cashmere sweaters in here.

430
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,020
But when we ran out of paper towels,

431
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,430
You did scream, "just use
anything, make it stop."

432
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,090
And of course, we'll pay to
have them all dry cleaned.

433
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, that's nice. Keep them.

434
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Okay, we can leave.

435
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,770
I am off the phone with my therapist.

436
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,010
And it goes without saying,
we won't charge you guys

437
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,070
for this weekend.

438
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,910
No way. Here.

439
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,240
You are taking this check and
my therapist's phone number.

440
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,650
I do not know how you are
standing up without him.

441
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,680
What? Come on, this is nothing.

442
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,450
One month, the floor actually
opened up and swallowed us.

443
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,190
Yeah, we've been through worse.

444
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,960
Oh, it's really cool the way
you two support each other.

445
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,830
Yup, we're a pair of support hose.

446
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,500
And speaking of support...

447
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,560
Here, Max.

448
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,100
No way!

449
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,700
Look, Caroline, it's a bra-nanza!

450
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,140
And, Caroline, since you don't
really need to wear a bra...

451
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,040
Here. This apartment may be hell,

452
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,650
but you are a real angel.

453
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,250
Aw, my own wings?

454
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,680
Thank you, guys.

455
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,290
Hey, can I ask you something?

456
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,790
As long as it doesn't have
anything to do with rats.

457
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,520
How come you didn't
invite us to the party?

458
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,390
What? I thought Martha did.

459
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,260
I thought Lily did.

460
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,030
(both) Model moment!

461
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,440
Pick-up, Caroline!

462
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,740
Yup, I always knew you would die here.

463
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
Pick-up, Max!

464
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,920
Looking good, Max.

465
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,720
After you drop that, have
Caroline come back here

466
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,660
and lock me in the walk-in
till Sophie gets home.

467
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,330
Max, I just realized we're
kind of the supermodels

468
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,060
of waitressing.

469
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,400
And I just realized my boobs
aren't always supposed to hit

470
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,070
my side.
