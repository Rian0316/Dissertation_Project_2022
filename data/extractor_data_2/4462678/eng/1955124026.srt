1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Yo !!!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Previously on "Better Call Saul"

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,340
I can't believe Davis and Main went for it.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,170
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,693
You can't...

6
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:09,310
Tomorrow morning, eight
o'clock, my office,

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,660
with the partners, and
we wanna see this thing.

8
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,030
There may have been some solicitation.

9
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,050
I put myself on the line
to get you this job.

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,580
So what, you threw me a bone?

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,640
It's my word. It's my judgment.

12
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,530
You want next level pay, you
gotta do next level work.

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,040
You wanna tell me what we're doing here?

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,250
There's a guy.

15
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,480
I need him to go away.

16
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,180
My husband and I scrimped and
saved for so many years.

17
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,550
We did our best to build a nest egg

18
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,800
so that we wouldn't be a
burden to our family.

19
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,650
After Ronald passed, I moved to
an assisted-living facility...

20
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,420
A nice place.

21
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,770
They told me they'd take
care of everything,

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,390
but then, one day, they
said all my money was gone.

23
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,500
How could that be?

24
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,430
Where did it all go?

25
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,320
If you or a loved one

26
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,890
is a resident of a Sandpiper
crossing facility

27
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,890
or other associated retirement community...

28
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,640
Jesus. ‭You used your own voice?

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,410
You may be eligible to

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,980
- receive compensation.
- Strictly to save money.

31
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,170
- All in, the whole thing cost...
- Just...

32
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,600
For a free consultation,

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,870
call the law offices of Davis & Main

34
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,040
at 505-242-7700.

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,870
That's 505-242-7700.

36
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,860
The production costs... $647, all in.

37
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,070
The one single airing was a
$700 ad buy, so dirt-cheap.

38
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,960
You think this is about money?

39
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,420
You think that's what this is about?

40
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm just trying to offer
complete information here.

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,680
Now, this one airing...
it was an experiment,

42
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,270
and as such, by any measure, a success.

43
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,630
You keep using the word "Experiment"

44
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,280
like you're ‭the goddamned Wright brothers.

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,820
When exactly were you gonna
tell us about this experiment?

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,500
Today.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,560
This morning.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,470
I-I admit, I got a little ahead of myself,

49
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,190
a little... exuberant.

50
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,970
And for that, I apologize.

51
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,610
But the headline here is... I think...

52
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,640
We've gotten nearly 200 phone
calls since this one airing.

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,650
Cliff, since you and I spoke last night,

54
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,940
72 more.

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,620
You hear that? Right there...
that's the sound of victory.

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,870
Jimmy, stop selling.

57
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,570
And don't act like ‭you
don't see the problem here.

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,210
I don't.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,150
You cut us out.

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,790
You did an end run around us.

61
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,500
Exuberance is no excuse.

62
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,900
Cliff.

63
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,000
Client outreach is my department.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,450
Now, you told me that from day one.

65
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,340
Jimmy, if I put you in charge
of payroll, would that mean

66
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,880
I'd be okay with you giving
everyone a million-dollar bonus?

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,750
You and I did discuss the
possibility of a commercial.

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,740
The possibility in the abstract,

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,630
for a grand total of 30 seconds
when I was halfway out the door.

70
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,170
I guess... I thought I heard enthusiasm,

71
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,170
so I-I took some initiative.

72
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,470
"Some."

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,330
We are a team at Davis & Main.

74
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,050
This is a team approach.

75
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,990
You coming to us ‭as a solo practitioner...

76
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,600
I knew there was gonna be a learning curve.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,220
But if you simply can't fit
in as part of the team...

78
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,510
I can fit in. I-I fit in.

79
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,530
I am here to help you
and HHM win Sandpiper.

80
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,960
That's all this was about.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,720
Sandpiper's not what keeps
the lights on around here.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
We have clients who wouldn't
want to be associated

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,640
with this kind of... this.

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,530
Our image, our reputation

85
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,060
is something we've been
carefully building for years.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,450
It's worth far more than any one case.

87
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,800
Something like this could damage it.

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,130
Suffice it to say,

89
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,520
there's not a lot of love for
you in the room at the moment.

90
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,600
The vote is currently two to
one to fire you for cause.

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,040
However...

92
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,380
I believe in second chances.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,710
But know this is both
strike one and strike two.

94
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,760
Going forward, you can expect
a great deal more scrutiny.

95
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,970
Come on. Come on.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,300
Hello.

97
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,120
You've reached the
voice-mail of Kim Wexler.

98
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,030
Please leave me a message,

99
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,770
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

100
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,620
Hey, kim.

101
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,950
I need you to call me as
soon as you can, all right?

102
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,370
It's a time-sensitive thing, so, uh,

103
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,960
I mean, I may have, uh, just...

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,830
Well, please call me before
you talk to Howard, okay?

105
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,630
Bye.

106
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,140
It's a simple question, Kim...

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,350
Did you or did you not know
about this commercial?

108
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,820
I... yes.

109
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,480
He showed it to me.

110
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,560
He showed it to you?

111
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,850
Yes. A few days ago.

112
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,950
And you didn't say anything to anyone?

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,850
No. I didn't.

114
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,850
You didn't think I deserved a heads-up?

115
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,120
I didn't realize...

116
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,510
At the time, ‭I didn't
think it was necessary.

117
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,170
Well, you were wrong about that.

118
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,420
We were caught flat-footed
in front of our co-counsel,

119
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,420
which I don't need to tell you,
does not reflect well on HHM.

120
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,830
Or on you.

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,120
That'll be all.

122
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,930
You can go.

123
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,490
What are you going to do?

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,500
So, what do you think?

125
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,540
I figure from here, you've got
a good bead on the place,

126
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,160
but someone inside...
they can't pick you out.

127
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,820
Tuco and me... that's our spot.

128
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,190
He always sits facing out,

129
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,550
makes it look like it's a gangster thing,

130
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,870
but I know it's just so he
can keep an eye on his ride.

131
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,790
Every Tuesday, ‭we're
here squaring accounts.

132
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,740
Dealer comes in, pays what he owes.

133
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,650
Tuco... he likes to get face-to-face.

134
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,680
Says everything he needs to
know is written right here.

135
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,590
Looks 'em in the eyes.

136
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,590
Just stares, like he's
looking inside of 'em.

137
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,330
I've seen him go like that 5, 10 minutes.

138
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,860
And what does that accomplish?

139
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,760
Calls it his lie detector.

140
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,340
That's why these things go all day.

141
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,840
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?

142
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,970
Don't need it. ‭We can handle our business.

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,630
Anyway, it takes hours.

144
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,580
Collect the cash, count it, lie detector.

145
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,200
One at a time... guy comes in,
transacts, then the next.

146
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Then, when we're done, Tuco
gets in his car, I get in mine.

147
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,250
Boom. We go our separate ways.

148
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,230
That is where you come in.

149
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,110
You see him packing up...
wsssh... drive over.

150
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,750
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.

151
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,010
Pop. Head shot.

152
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,740
Roll out. Easy.

153
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,230
I-40 onramp is eight blocks up.

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,480
You're in the wind ‭before
anyone has time to blink.

155
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,270
And here's the beauty...
all these, um, dealers?

156
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,400
They know we're here, so the story is,

157
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,910
one of them got ideas,
decided to kill Tuco,

158
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,010
get a cut of the business.

159
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,020
Could've been any of them, as
far as the cartel's concerned.

160
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,940
These Tuesdays of yours...

161
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,880
Day or night when you wrap it up?

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,970
Day.
‭So, full daylight.

163
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,130
Plenty of traffic.

164
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,150
How exactly do I not get seen?

165
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,070
My car, at least.

166
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,700
Murphy's Law tells me
somebody's gonna pull a plate.

167
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,160
Fine. ‭Go to the yard. Buy a beater.

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,670
You're gonna stay in the car.

169
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,310
‭Ain't no one gonna see you.

170
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,130
And if they do see you, so what?

171
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,410
That's why you're perfect.

172
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,610
You're no one. You got no connections.

173
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,600
You're a ghost.

174
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,970
So, I pull in next to him...

175
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,670
That assumes there's a parking spot.

176
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,200
Our guys park next to him.

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,590
They come and go from the same spot.

178
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,360
Last one takes off, you're open.

179
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,430
Someone comes in behind me, I'm blocked.

180
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,380
Who's gonna pull in behind you?

181
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,250
Well, I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

182
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,050
What then?

183
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,980
What's my exit?

184
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,790
I don't know.

185
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,440
Get out and run.

186
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,130
Bad knees.

187
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,340
Look, the details... that's
what I'm paying you for.

188
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,380
You've got a better plan, go on, tell me.

189
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm all ears.

190
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,380
You sure about this?

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Killing your partner...

192
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,250
That's a bell you don't un-ring.

193
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,420
See this?

194
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,480
You know how I got this?

195
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,890
Back in '96, '97, Tuco and I

196
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,930
were working with these bikers
out of Riverside County.

197
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,710
They were running ‭this
peanut-butter crank...

198
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,910
Real shit, y'know?

199
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,040
But cheap, and we could sell
it as fast as we got it.

200
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,970
Anyway, ‭Tuco develops a taste for it.

201
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,010
And crank does not bring
out the best in people.

202
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,250
Made Tuco erratic.

203
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,420
Our connect ‭was a guy called Dawg Paulson.

204
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,140
One day, ‭Tuco's settling up with Dawg.

205
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,930
He decides ‭to put on his lie detector.

206
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,060
Dawg's like, ‭ "What the hell?" You know.

207
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,800
Tuco just keeps staring at him.

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,410
Then he goes real quiet.

209
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,170
"You think I'm an idiot, Dawg?"

210
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,820
He thinks Dawg is supplying his competitor,

211
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,160
trying to cut Tuco out.

212
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,550
Dawg... he denies it.

213
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,030
"No way! Not me!"

214
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,590
Tuco doesn't even ‭raise
his voice, but suddenly,

215
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,370
he's got a sawed-off and...

216
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,710
right in Dawg's face.

217
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,000
I was behind him.

218
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,760
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.

219
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,150
And this?

220
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,780
A piece of Dawg's skull...

221
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,660
Under the skin, a little piece of him.

222
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,320
I tried digging it out, but
it's in there pretty good.

223
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,740
Anyway, not the kinda thing
you go to the doctor's for.

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,970
The thing about it was,
Tuco really liked dawg.

225
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,650
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,250
But when he's using, loco, crazy.

227
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,720
There's no other way to put it.

228
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,940
And he's using again.

229
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,010
Crystal... much bigger kick.

230
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,870
So... It's like you said.

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,390
If Tuco finds out about my,
y'know, independent ventures,

232
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,220
it's gonna be Dawg all over again.

233
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,050
It's him or me.

234
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,740
There.

235
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,760
A man with a scoped rifle
could get a clean shot.

236
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,430
Fire a single round,

237
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,880
disappear before anybody
knew what had happened.

238
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,540
No witnesses. Clean egress.

239
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,580
Pretty far.

240
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
You can make that shot?

241
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,690
Yeah.

242
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,070
You saying you'll do it?

243
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,680
50 grand?

244
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
50 grand.

245
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll look into it.

246
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,010
Your brother isn't here, Mr. Mcgill.

247
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,690
I know.

248
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,380
Uh, he sent me to get his ink blotter.

249
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,510
I'll just be a second.
‭Watch yourself.

250
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,640
The floor's slick.

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,410
Oh, thank you, Gesualdo.

252
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,860
Sorry about the floor!

253
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,140
Oh, no.

254
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,040
Are you looking for Ms. Wexler?

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,550
I guess I'm too late, huh?

256
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,950
No, she's still here.

257
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,150
Where?

258
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,260
Kim.

259
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,950
I am so, so sorry.

260
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,060
I should have told you last night.

261
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,380
You think?

262
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,540
I honestly thought I could fix it.

263
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,290
I thought they'd understand
once they saw the numbers.

264
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,430
I knew it would work, and it did.

265
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,850
It worked.

266
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,040
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

267
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,470
because of something I did.

268
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,250
Plus, at an ‭entirely different law firm.

269
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,540
What the hell kind of
sense does that make?!

270
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,140
I told you this would happen.

271
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,480
He can't blame you for this.

272
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,930
I warned you he would.

273
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm talking to Howard.

274
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,690
What? And call him a pig fucker again?

275
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,320
Yeah, that'll help.

276
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,720
I screwed up, you know?

277
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,850
I know that.

278
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,540
But this... this is total B.S.!

279
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm... ‭I'm talking to him tonight!

280
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,490
Jimmy, no. ‭You'd only make things worse.

281
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,440
I'll explain it to him.
‭No!

282
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm not asking you... I'm telling you.

283
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,900
If you go to Howard, you and I...
we're done.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,090
So, we're not done now?

285
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,930
I need this job.

286
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,740
And there's a weekly billing quota
that I'm about 40 hours behind on,

287
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,190
so could you please just go?

288
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,890
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,490
Chuck!

290
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,380
Chuck!

291
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,030
Come on!

292
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm not going away!

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,700
All right, you asked for it!

294
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,370
I'm comin' in!

295
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,850
Chuck?

296
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,660
Chuck?

297
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,570
Can you hear me?

298
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,900
Can you talk to me?

299
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,480
Do you want me ‭to get you to the hospital?

300
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,180
No. No hospitals.

301
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,180
I'll... I'll be all right.

302
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,080
Get some water, please.

303
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,250
Extra protection here.

304
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,430
Here. You know what?

305
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,390
Sit up.

306
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,940
Can you sit?

307
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,460
All right.

308
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,780
Okay. All right.

309
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,820
Here.

310
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,460
That's the Armalite AR-50...

311
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,940
State of the art, ‭accurate
to 2,400 meters.

312
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,020
I got the Leupold mark 4 on it now,

313
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,710
but I can always upgrade
you to a Schmidt & Bender.

314
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,390
Single shot, bolt.

315
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,130
Simple, effective, reliable.

316
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,790
It fires the .50-caliber BMG...

317
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,210
Very effective against soft
targets in light cover...

318
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,150
Behind cars, ‭small-diameter
trees, and such.

319
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,250
As always, I've gone to the trouble

320
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,300
of grinding down the serial number.

321
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,830
Well, unless you ‭ground
a hole clean through,

322
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,420
acid will recover it.

323
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,720
Well, that would be true,

324
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,890
but I follow up with a pass through
‭a random-stipple machine press.

325
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,440
Hides the patterns in the metal density.

326
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Should throw off your X-ray diffraction

327
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,940
and some other higher-end methods.

328
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,960
Nothing's perfect, of
course, but this is close.

329
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,470
Looks like a hernia with a scope on it.

330
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,310
34 pounds,

331
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,440
not including your bipod,
which adds some heft.

332
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,350
Too much gun.

333
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,100
For most applications,
I would tend to agree.

334
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,670
SR-25 match rifle... Eugene
Stoner design, semi-auto.

335
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,860
That's about 11 pounds there.

336
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,380
Not quite the range or
the punch of the AR-50,

337
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,580
but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.

338
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,590
at well past 1,000 meters.

339
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,230
I've heard they're prone to jam.

340
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,050
Well, it's been known
to happen in the field,

341
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,960
but there's not a semi-auto
built can boast it never jams.

342
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,200
If that's a concern, you
ought to stick to bolts.

343
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,200
Good bolt-action rifle... if you jammed it,

344
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,560
I'd wager ‭you were setting out to do so.

345
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,880
Which brings us to the M40...

346
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,480
Tried and true, battle-tested.

347
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,060
Essentially, the same rifle

348
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,350
used by marine snipers since 1966.

349
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,110
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets

350
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,230
in the 800-to 1,2000-meter range.

351
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,680
You seem to know this one.

352
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh, yeah.

353
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,900
You could say that.

354
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,860
That's the A1 model.

355
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,050
There's not much change from the original.

356
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,590
Biggest difference is the stock...

357
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,740
It's fiberglass instead of wood.

358
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,330
It changed it over in 1970 or so.

359
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,390
Good. Wood warped like hell.

360
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,830
You get it wet, ‭you put
it in the sun... gone.

361
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,360
Somebody probably
‭should've figured that out

362
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,940
before they sent it into a damn jungle.

363
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah. Probably.

364
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,940
If these aren't to your liking,

365
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,950
I could get my hands on a few more.

366
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,040
No.

367
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,640
I've changed my mind.

368
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,420
Thank you.

369
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,460
I don't need anything at this time.

370
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,600
For your trouble.

371
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,990
Oh, it's no trouble.

372
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,550
I make my living on repeat business.

373
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,700
When you need what I'm offering,
you know how to find me.

374
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,830
You're still here.

375
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,400
Yeah, I'm still here.

376
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,510
Did you get any sleep?

377
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,200
Some.

378
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,650
Enough.

379
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,850
‭How you feeling?

380
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,730
I could use some tea.

381
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,410
Thanks.

382
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,250
‭You scared me last night.

383
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,700
Yeah. Happens sometimes.

384
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,760
Sometimes, I overdo it... that's all.

385
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,310
It passes.

386
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,400
Going into the office really
takes it out of you, doesn't it?

387
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,370
If I stay too long, yeah.

388
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,070
Guess it's hard not to stay.

389
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,750
There's so many important
things for you to do there...

390
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,180
Like, you know, stick it to Kim Wexler.

391
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,320
What did I do to Kim Wexler?

392
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,960
She's back in the cornfield, isn't she?

393
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,870
I didn't do anything to Kim.

394
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,110
I mean, I was present, yes.

395
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,640
But management of personnel...
those decisions are all Howard's.

396
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,870
That is rich.

397
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,660
But tell me,

398
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,030
when Howard was makin' his
"management decisions,"

399
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,230
was he sitting on your knee
with your arm up his ass?

400
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,870
Hey, can he talk while you
drink a glass of water?

401
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,470
That's uncalled-for.

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,110
And if howard were my puppet,

403
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,040
he certainly wouldn't have
recommended you to Davis & Main.

404
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,800
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler

405
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,540
who talked him into doing that.
Hence his anger.

406
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,200
Don't punish Kim.

407
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,630
If you're mad at me, take it out on me.

408
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,380
I know you like to think the world
revolves around you, Jimmy,

409
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,410
but this has nothing to do with you.

410
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,610
Kim had a responsibility
to Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

411
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,030
She should have been looking
out for her firm's interests.

412
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,720
Not letting us know what you
were up to was her mistake.

413
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,540
Oh, come on.

414
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,860
You can't be pissed off at her about this.

415
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm not.

416
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,460
Howard is.

417
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,380
And why shouldn't he be?

418
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,600
Because she didn't know.

419
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,690
She didn't know I was
gonna air the commercial.

420
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,450
She didn't know ‭I hadn't
gotten it approved.

421
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,320
She just... she didn't know.

422
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,530
- I see.
- So, she didn't know

423
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,600
there was anything that she
was supposed to tell Howard.

424
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,380
As far as she was concerned, Cliff
Main was already looped in.

425
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,700
You told her he was?

426
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,790
I implied it.

427
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,780
So it's on me, not her.

428
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,470
She didn't say anything to us about that.

429
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,620
Well, she wouldn't.

430
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,320
Sh-she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

431
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,740
You have to admit this shows a
lack of judgment on her part.

432
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,700
She knows you.

433
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,880
She should have known better.

434
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,790
You are such an asshole.

435
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,600
Why?

436
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,290
For pointing out that her one
mistake was believing in you?

437
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,170
For Christ's sake, can we
get some perspective here?

438
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,950
It was a simple, little commercial.

439
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,820
It aired once... that's all.

440
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,360
And can I remind you... it worked.

441
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,160
It worked like a dream.

442
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,550
See, that's your problem, Jimmy...

443
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,340
Thinking the ends justify the means.

444
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,290
And you're forever shocked when
it all blows up in your face.

445
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,300
What did I do that was so wrong?

446
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,720
You broke the rules.

447
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,190
‭You turned Kim into your accessory.

448
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,630
You embarrassed Howard, who...
god help him...

449
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,290
Inexplicably vouched for
you with Cliff Main!

450
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,400
You made Cliff and his
partners look like schmucks!

451
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,750
Shall I go on?!

452
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,950
How he hasn't fired you for
this positively mystifies me.

453
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,210
"Perspective."

454
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,350
You want perspective?

455
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,640
I'll give you mine...

456
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,750
You're my brother and I love you,

457
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,680
but you're like an alcoholic

458
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,210
who refuses to admit he's got a problem.

459
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,660
Now someone's given you the
keys to the school bus,

460
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,990
and I'm not gonna let you
drive it off a cliff!

461
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,720
Now, can we just get down
to brass tacks here?

462
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,910
What can I do to put Kim
back where she belongs, huh?

463
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,360
What... you want me to quit Davis & Main?

464
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,150
That's fine.

465
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,290
I-I never wanted that
job in the first place.

466
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,520
I can't get through to you.

467
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,940
Life is not one big game
of "Let's Make a Deal"!

468
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,190
Yes, it is! ‭I'm Monty Hall!

469
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,600
What's behind door number two?

470
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,240
What'll it take, huh?!

471
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,500
You want me to quit being a lawyer?

472
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,810
Ju... a chimp with a machine gun...

473
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,970
That's me, right, huh?!

474
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,310
So, what do you say?

475
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,560
You help Kim... I quit the law.

476
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,830
Is that a deal? - ‭I didn't say that.

477
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,940
No, you didn't say it, but
that's what you want, right?!

478
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,160
That's why you put the screws
to Kim in the first place...

479
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,140
To squeeze me!

480
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,710
I didn't say that, ‭and
I would never say that!

481
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,720
Why not?!

482
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,530
Because if I were impeding the
career of one of my employees

483
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,450
for the purpose of compelling you
to do something against your will,

484
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,020
that would be extortion.

485
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah. ‭

486
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,890
It would. So?

487
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,190
You gonna extort me, Chuck?

488
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,330
It's a lead-pipe cinch
you'd get away with it.

489
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,660
It's real easy... you just
set things right for Kim.

491
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,700
You get her back in her
office, out of doc review...

492
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,860
Everything back to normal,
and I quit the law for good.

493
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,390
No more Jimmy McGill, esquire... poof!

494
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,060
Like he never even existed.

495
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,320
But I need to hear the words
come out of your mouth, okay?

496
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
‭You're a man of your word.

497
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,900
You're an upstanding man, right?

498
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,140
For god's sake, Jimmy. ‭- Come on, chuck!

499
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,010
Extort me!

500
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,210
Say "quit," and I will quit,

501
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,950
but I need to hear it from your mouth!

502
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,600
You want me to commit a felony...

503
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,680
Because that's what you'd do, right?

504
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,680
Because you want to believe that
deep down, I'm some hypocrite!

505
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,110
Let's find out.

506
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,420
Come on down, Chuck!

507
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,400
Roll around in the dirt with me!

508
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,740
All your dreams will come true!

509
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,230
Go on! Do it! Go on!

510
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,600
I am not the bad guy here.

511
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,720
You don't want to be a lawyer...

512
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,500
That's between you ‭and
the New Mexico State bar.

513
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,190
You want to quit Davis & Main? Be my guest!

514
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,680
You clearly don't need any help
from me to tank your career.

515
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,450
You're doing just fine on your own.

516
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,200
Speaking of which, it's an
hour's drive to Santa Fe.

517
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Even if you leave right now,

518
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
you're still gonna be at least
20 minutes late for work...

519
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,520
Another feather in your
cap with Clifford Main.

520
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,550
So?

521
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,810
I'm not gonna do it.

522
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,570
What... ‭are you negotiating now?

523
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,080
No amount of money makes
this a good idea... for you.

524
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,090
Look, man, ‭I told you that I'm not...

525
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,980
No, it's a bad move because it
doesn't solve your real problem.

526
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,540
My real problem? What's that?

527
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,270
It's not Tuco.

528
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,180
It's keeping a secret.

529
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,140
A dead Tuco ‭draws Salamancas like flies.

530
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,790
The cartel noses into the business,

531
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,460
looks for who hit one of theirs.

532
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,000
You gonna be able to
keep your secrets then?

533
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,680
Something's got to give.

534
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,760
With you, without you... I don't care.

535
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,480
But something's gonna happen.

536
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,440
You said it yourself.

537
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,680
You don't need him dead...
you need him to go away.

538
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,120
You mean snitch?

539
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,340
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco,

540
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,020
who do you think the cartel looks at?

541
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,770
Me.

542
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,400
And if I call the cops,
I get picked up, too.

543
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,850
I'm what you call a known associate.

544
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,700
So I'm locked up with Tuco,

545
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,500
who's looking for the
guy that put him there.

546
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Tell me how that helps me.

547
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,840
You won't have to talk to the cops.

548
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,310
You won't have to do any time.

549
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,220
There's no killing, but your Tuco problem?

550
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,510
It goes away.

551
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,750
It's all there.

552
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,270
Let the man count.

553
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,250
We're good.

554
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,920
So, uh... till next time, huh?

555
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,900
Tuco.

556
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,790
Okay.

557
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,820
Go.

558
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,920
Okay.

559
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,600
I'll, uh... ‭I'll see you next week, Tuco.

560
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,900
Nacho.

561
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,240
Yeah, see you, Domingo.

562
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,900
He's got good numbers.

563
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,950
He's hustlin'.

564
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,230
What do you think?

565
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,150
Solid?

566
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,690
Uh, uh, y-yes, I would like
to report a fight going on

567
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,000
at the El Michoacano restaurant
in the 5000 block of

568
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,190
the Isleta Boulevard.

569
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,400
There's a man threatening
another man with a gun.

570
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,290
It looks to be some sort of gang thing.

571
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,110
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.

572
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,300
I-I... I'm a passerby.

573
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,440
I-I don't want to get involved.

574
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,210
The fuck.

575
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,930
Did you see that?

576
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,500
See what?

577
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,290
That old man just hit my car.

578
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,120
Hello. Oh. Hmm.

579
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,510
Well, let me see.

580
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,580
Give me the number four,
the pollo, por favor.

581
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,310
That's to go.
‭Yes, sir.

582
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,220
Hey, you.

583
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,490
Hey, gramps.

584
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,990
You just hit my car.

585
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,520
Uh, you're talking to me?

586
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,530
Check out Mr. Magoo here.

587
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,040
Uh, y-yes, sir.

588
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,430
You see that car that you parked
your piece of shit next to?

589
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,660
That's mine.

590
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,040
You just ran into it.

591
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,800
No, I don't think I did.

592
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,230
You calling me a liar?

593
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,650
Uh, no.

594
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,980
Hey. I saw it, too.

595
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,700
You gonna stand here and deny it?

596
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,350
Um, guys, um, I-I don't
know what to tell you.

597
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,390
I'm not aware ‭of hitting anyone's car,

598
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,390
but if I did... I apologize.

599
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,100
So...
‭$6.33.

600
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,680
You keep the change.

601
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,970
Thank you.

602
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,980
Excuse me.

603
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,730
Don't you walk away from me.

604
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,120
Hey, pops. You better listen to the man.

605
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,440
Come on, guys.

606
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,150
Let's just keep things friendly, all right?

607
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,600
I ain't your friend.

608
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,230
Look!

609
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,600
You see that? You... you did that.

610
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,710
Oh, come on. That'll buff right out.

611
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,990
You're gonna make this all right.

612
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,590
You're not leaving until you do.

613
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,830
Fine. You got a pen?

614
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,790
A pen.

615
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,170
A pen... we'll exchange
information, insurance.

616
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,300
I have very good coverage.

617
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,760
They'll take care of this.

618
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm not messing around with insurance, ése.

619
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,820
Cash.

620
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,650
Listen, I'm willing to
accept responsibility,

621
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,490
but if you're not going through insurance,

622
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,110
then I have maybe 20, 30 bucks on me...
that's all.

623
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,090
Kay, now you're lying to me.

624
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,490
I saw your wallet.

625
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,100
You got plenty in there.

626
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,740
Take it out.

627
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,270
Let's look together, jog your memory.

628
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
You heard him.

629
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,140
Take out the wallet.

630
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I just cashed my social security check.

631
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,310
It's all I have till the end of the month,

632
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,280
and I am not giving it to you.

633
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,960
You're not?

634
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,030
I offered to do this the right way.

635
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,680
If you can't accept that,
then I can't help you.

636
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,840
Aw, come on, guys.

637
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,070
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.

638
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,170
Give me your wallet, and maybe
you walk away from this.

639
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,540
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

640
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,720
Nah, homes.

641
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,920
Give me your wallet.

642
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,900
Let's just stay calm here.

643
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,990
‭You see me sweating, bitch?

644
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,900
Wallet. ‭

645
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,810
Wallet.

646
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,110
Wallet.

647
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,400
There's like $400 here.

648
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,590
You got some crazy lip on you, old man.

649
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,030
Your life worth 400 bucks?

650
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,220
Hey, Tuco, time to bounce.

651
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,860
Yeah, go. Go.

652
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,850
You're... one lucky old man.

653
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,660
What the hell? Let go!

654
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,170
Let go!

655
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,840
Let... Let... Let go!

656
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Let go!

657
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,390
‭Let go!

658
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,060
Let go!

659
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,850
Let me see your hands!

660
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,130
Hands up! Now!

661
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,580
On the ground!

662
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,920
That all you got?

663
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,830
Get on the ground!

664
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,450
Look at you.

665
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,280
Are you gonna have to testify?

666
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,290
The cops witnessed him in
the commission of a felony.

667
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,340
My wallet in his pocket.

668
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,660
Add the gun... ‭he gets a 5-to-10 stretch.

669
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,250
$25,000.

670
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,740
You definitely earned it.

671
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,510
Still, you coulda gotten twice
as much for 1/10 the hassle.

672
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,480
You woulda done the world a favor.

673
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,950
You wouldn't look like someone
took a lead pipe to your face.

674
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,280
Plus, when Tuco gets out, maybe
he comes looking for you.

675
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,780
Get to the point.

676
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,350
Just saying... you went a long
way to not pull that trigger.

677
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,930
Why?
