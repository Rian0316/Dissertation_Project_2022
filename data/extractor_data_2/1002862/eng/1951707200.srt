1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,990
Previously on
Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,590
Gabrielle tried to
rekindle an old affair.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,990
Gaby, i'm getting married.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,090
And i was married
when we got together.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,100
That is not how
i'm gonna be married.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,190
Lynette got the support she
needed for chemotherapy.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,590
Katherine, who liked
everything in its place... Ooh!

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,290
Thought that her husband
was forgetting his.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, i guess you learned
nothing from chicago.

10
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,690
Bree's attempt to keep

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,590
Her daughter's
pregnancy a secret...

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,890
You are keeping my
grandchildren from me.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,600
Evoked an unexpected response.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,390
We're life partners.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,190
And Susan tried to connect
with the newest neighbors.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,390
Yeah, i've seen a
lot of cable, so i get it.

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I hope we can live
up to your stereotype.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,800
I should go.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,290
The odd-looking boxes

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,490
Were delivered to the home of
Bob Hunter and Lee Mcdermott

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,600
Early on a tuesday morning.

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,990
It wasn't long before
workmen had opened them

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
And begun assembling
the various parts and pieces.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,090
Happily, it only took three hours

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,400
<i>to turn the contents</i>
<i>into a finished work of art.</i>

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,800
<i>Sadly,</i>
<i>it only took 15 minutes</i>

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>for the residents</i>
<i>of wisteria lane...</i>

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,600
what the hell is it?

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,100
<i>To become art critics.</i>

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,100
I think it's a sculpture.
I think it's crap.

31
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,600
Of a the gay men
in the world,

32
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,800
we have to get the two
without taste.
What are we gonna do

33
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,800
i say we keep smiling
and look for the hidden cameras.

34
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,400
I think we're about
to get punk'd.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
I don't think there's anything
we <i>can</i> do. It's not our lawn.
It's our neighborhood,

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
and we have rules
against this sort of thing,

37
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,500
or at least we did
when i used to live here.

38
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,600
Who's running
the homeowners association?

39
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,500
Well, it was mary alice,
but as you may have heard...

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,000
yes, very tragic. So we haven't
had a president in four years?

41
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,200
No one would volunteer.
It's a pain-in-the-ass job.

42
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,700
I'll volunteer.

43
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,900
We can hold an election
in the next couple of days.

44
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,900
I can get rid of this tinfoil
atrocity by the weekend.

45
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,900
Okay, before we become
an ugly mob,

46
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,300
why doesn't one of us
go talk to the guys?

47
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,000
But not me.
They hate me.

48
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,600
Bree, you talk to them.
You can relate to them.

49
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,100
Why would you say that?

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,100
You got a kid who came
flying out of the closet

51
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,200
and a husband who's been
looking for the doorknob.

52
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,500
What? You've met him.

53
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,800
Ooh! They're coming.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Good morning, ladies.

55
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,100
Hi. Uh, we were just talking
about your sculpture.

56
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:30,300
That's what
i love about art...

57
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:33,400
the way
it provokes discussion.
Although it would've been nice

58
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:36,500
if you had discussed it
with us.
What, you don't...

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
well,
we're not saying that.

60
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,100
It's just a little,
uh...

61
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,100
it's an eyesore.

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
Really?
Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,100
You hear that, bob?
We flew to finland

64
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,400
and paid $24,000
to commission an eyesore.

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,700
I don't mind it.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,700
Not to brag,
but i went to art school.
Community college.

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,500
And they taught us
that art is subjective.

68
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,300
Thank you, susan.

69
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,100
Sun's need
for approval aside,

70
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,900
this clearly is not appropriate
for the street.

71
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:09,100
Wisteria lane
has a... traditional look.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,100
Well,
maybe you'd like it better

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,700
if we covered it
with a gingham throw.

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,500
Ladies, uh, i'm sorry.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,500
We honestly thought
that people would like it,

76
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,700
but even if you disapprove,
we hope that you will respect

77
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:27,200
our right to decorate
as we see fit.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,700
Have a nice day, philistines.

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>Yes, art came to Wisteria lane</i>
<i>on a tuesday morning,</i>

80
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,700
<i>and by tuesday afternoon...</i>

81
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,800
i think it's time to reconvene
the homeowners' association.

82
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,900
All in favor?

83
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,900
Aye.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>War had come as well.</i>

85
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,800
<i>As word of the sculpture</i>
<i>spread,</i>

86
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,800
<i>Bob and lee began to wonder</i>

87
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>if any of their neighbors</i>
<i>would be supportive.</i>

88
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>But when the sculpture's</i>
<i>true function</i>

89
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>was unveiled the next day,</i>

90
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:15,700
<i>whatever support</i>
<i>they did have...</i>

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,400
<i>was quickly washed away.</i>

92
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
Come on.

93
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,400
It's 6:00 a.m.
What is that?

94
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,900
I don't know,
but make it stop.

95
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:31,300
Oh.

96
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, my god.

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,900
Wow! It's a fountain, too.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,900
We would have mentioned that
yesterday,

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
but your friends
were a little uptight.

100
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,600
Yeah,
they can get like that.

101
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,100
So do you think that you can
just turn it off for a second?

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
What's up?

103
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,200
I was just wondering, um,

104
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:07,800
do you think you could
move it to your backyard?

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Why?
I thought you liked it.

106
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:13,100
Remember? You said,
"art is subjective."

107
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,500
Yes. <i>quiet</i> art is subjective,

108
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,600
but you see, mike is working
really long hours lately,

109
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,000
and he can't sleep
with all that noise.

110
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,000
We're not gonna turn it off
because we need it to drown out

111
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,300
all the stuff we hear
coming from your house.
Like what?

112
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's see. You yakking
to your mom on the phone.

113
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
You grunting
through your pilates dvds.

114
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,700
You in the shower, butchering
the score to "brigadoon."

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
I have a lovely voice.

116
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Whoever told you that
is not your friend.

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,000
He's a little cranky. I think
someone needs his french toast.

118
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,600
Come on, lee.

119
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:46,900
No, no, no, no.
No, no, we're not done here.

120
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:49,900
As your neighbor,
i have a right to be heard...

121
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,900
and i say
that simple human decency

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
dictates that you turn off
that fountain <i>right now!</i>

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey, guys.

124
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,100
Do over, parker.

125
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,100
Hey, guys, i got your snack.

126
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,800
What you playing?

127
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,300
Action figures.
Wanna play, mom?

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,500
She does
<i>awesome</i> alien voices.

129
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,300
Thanks, sweetheart.

130
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,100
Hello?

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh, yeah. Hi, dr. Shiller.

132
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:23,800
Okay,
that's my white blood count.

133
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,500
Uh-huh, but as long
as it's higher than 4.0,

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,500
that means
i don't have neutropenia, right?

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Well, that's great.

136
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,200
Thanks for calling.

137
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, you, too. Bye.

138
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,600
What?

139
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,300
You can't talk about doctors
up here.

140
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,100
Or about being sick.

141
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,500
If you do, you have to go.
That's the rule.

142
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,400
Well...

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,200
that's a good rule.

144
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,700
Although it wasn't bad news.
It was actually...

145
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,500
doesn't matter.
We voted. It's a rule.

146
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,000
Got it.

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,100
Sick talk done, okay?

148
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,700
You guys have fun.

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
Freeze power.

150
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,200
Do over, parker. That
guy doesn't have freezing power.

151
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,200
If his guy can fly,
my guy can freeze.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Hi. It's, uh, mrs. Hodge. May i
please speak with danielle?

153
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,600
Mmm. Muffins.
T...

154
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,600
hands off. We're bringing these
to danielle for her birthday.

155
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,400
What do you mean,
she's gone?

156
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,800
And you believed her?

157
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,300
You idiot!

158
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,900
I should sue yourirresponsible

159
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,200
yeah, well, good day to you,
too, reverend mother!

160
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,300
What happened?
Those stupid nuns
at the convent

161
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,700
let danielle's grandmother
kidnap her.

162
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,200
She claimed i'd given her
permission for a weekend visit.

163
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Phyllis! It's me.

164
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,500
You can screen
your calls all you want to,

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,500
but trust me, old woman,
you are in a world of trouble.

166
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,800
I know where you live,
and i am coming for you.

167
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,100
Shouldn't we be worried?

168
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,800
No,
i think we're ready for her.

169
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,200
Now show me again
how you kill the zombies.

170
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Oh.

171
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,500
Why can't i go? I play golf.
...-

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
and i'd love to meet
yo... college buddies.

173
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,100
Edie, me and the guys have only
two rules for these weekends...

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,500
no plaidants
and no women.

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Fine. Be that way.

176
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,100
And to think,
i got you a gift.

177
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
Hey, golf balls.

178
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,000
They're monogrammed.

179
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,200
Wait.
These are your initials.

180
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,900
Exactly. While you're
out there playing,

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,700
want everyone to know
<i>who</i> your balls belong to.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Good work, boys, but i have
to head out in a few minutes,

183
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,800
so make sure you put all
the stuff back in the garage.

184
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,100
Hello?

185
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Hey, on my way.

186
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,100
Meet you at the hotel, okay?

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm leaving in five minutes.

188
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,300
Uh, brett,
could you come here a second?

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
How long has that van
been parked over there?
Couple hours.

190
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,300
Hours? Are you serious?

191
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,300
Oh, my god.
I think he's just waiting
for someone to come home.

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Brett, when's the last time
a cable guy waited for anyone?

193
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,400
I see a lot of lawn mowing
in your future.

194
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,200
Hey, it's me again.
You're not gonna believe this.

195
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,200
Before victor left
on his business trip,

196
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,200
he hired someone to tail me.

197
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,800
Oh, man.
Should we call this off?
No way.

198
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,300
It's gonna take more than
a guy with mini binoculars

199
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:52,300
and a bag of doughnuts
to keep me under lock d key.

200
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,700
I'll be there
as soon as i can.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
Boys, time to get paid.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on, eddie!

203
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,000
Bye, mrs. Lang.
See you next time.

204
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Come back here!

205
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,200
Are you taking
the bus home?

206
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
As soon as we get
around the corner,

207
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,900
we're gonna have to adjust
this horn.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
Gabrielle.

209
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey.

210
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,200
H-hi.

211
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,300
Iook at you. What a surprise.

212
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, uh, this is gaby.
This is my wife tammy.

213
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,900
Tammy, this is gabrielle.

214
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,800
Wow, look at you.
Congratulations.

215
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,000
Thanks.
It wasn't planned.

216
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay. So... are yoguys
staying here?

217
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,200
No, we just came
for some lunch.

218
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,800
Daddy owns this place.

219
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,200
That's right.
You're a hotel heiress.

220
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Yeah, but not
one of the skanky ones.

221
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,900
How do you two
know each other?

222
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,300
I used to be
gabrielle's gardener.

223
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:31,200
Oh!
Well, as you can see,

224
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,400
he's certainly married up
from lawn boy.

225
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,000
Tammy.
What?

226
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,000
Forget it.

227
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,100
So i heard
you married the mayor.

228
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,100
You're married
to victor lang?

229
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:44,400
He and daddy
go hunting together.

230
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,800
I told john if he would
just be nicer to daddy,

231
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,100
he could hang out
with people like the mayor

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,700
and make important contacts.

233
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,000
And i keep telling you
that i don't need

234
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,500
to kiss your father's ass
to have a career.

235
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Uh, yeah,
so i married the mayor.

236
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,400
Kooky, huh?

237
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:02,600
So, um,
is he here with you?

238
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:06,100
Uh, no. He's away
at a conference,

239
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:09,600
so i decided to treat myself
to a spa weend.

240
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Ooh! You should definitely
get the full body massage.

241
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,400
Oh, i plan to.

242
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,100
Good to see you.

243
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,700
You, too, gaby.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Sorry about that.
A complete shock.

245
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,200
I mean,
of all people to run into.

246
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,600
Who were they?

247
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Just an old friend
and his idiot wife.

248
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:35,800
Come on. Let's go.

249
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,600
Bree,
how lovely to see you.

250
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:45,000
Cram it, phyllis.
You got a lot of nerve

251
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,900
stealing danielle
from a convent we prepaid for.

252
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,700
She didn't steal me.

253
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a mature person capable
of making my own decisions.

254
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,900
Well, good.
You can decide to pack,

255
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,800
because we are taking you
back to the convent.

256
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,800
Mnh-mnh.
I'm turning 18 this weekend,

257
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,800
so you can't boss me around
anymore.

258
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:03,100
I'm staying with grandma,

259
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,700
and i'm gonna have my baby
delivered here.
We have

260
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,400
it's a retirement village.

261
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,700
All these doctors know
how to deliver is bad news.

262
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,700
I don't care. I'm staying,

263
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,000
and i'm gonna raise the baby
here, too.
What?

264
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,600
Entirely her idea.

265
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,900
A baby
is god's most precious gift.

266
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,900
I will not have mine raised

267
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:23,400
by a cold, emotionally
unavailable woman like you.

268
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,300
"Emotionally unavailable."

269
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:28,300
Gosh, i wonder where she
picked up that little phrase.
Hmm.

270
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,900
Like i'm too dumb
to think of it myself?

271
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:34,500
You're always mean to me,
just like you were to dad.

272
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,200
You emasculated him.

273
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,500
Well, you're not gonna
emasculate me.

274
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,500
You don't even know
what that means,

275
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,400
you petulant sock puppet!

276
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:45,100
Who cares?

277
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,900
I'm going to the store.

278
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,500
Buy a dictionary.

279
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,100
Would you like
some iced tea?

280
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,400
You aren't joining
the lynch mob?

281
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,400
Uh, you mean katherine's
homeowners thing?

282
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,500
Yeah, i think
i'll sit this one out.

283
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
No, no, no. You can't do that.
You've got to pick a side.

284
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,700
Art or mindless conformity?

285
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,100
See, this is one of
the upsides of having cancer.

286
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,000
You get to excuse yourself from
petty neighborhood squabbles.

287
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,300
You won't think they're so petty
when she comes after you.

288
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,600
Me? Why would she do that?

289
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:34,300
Did the homeowners' association
approve everything in your yard?

290
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,900
The fence? That swing?

291
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,400
The tree house?

292
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,800
I don't ink katherine
will bother herself

293
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,300
over a tree house.

294
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
First, they came
for the fountains,

295
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,000
and i did not speak out
because i had no fountain.
What?

296
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,600
Then they came
for the lawn gnomes,

297
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,800
and i did not speak out
because i had no gnome.
You're comparing kathene

298
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,700
then they came
for my tree house,

299
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:59,200
and there was no one left
to speak out for me.

300
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
Thank you, ladies.
I so appreciate your input,

301
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:08,200
and i think we can all agree

302
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,000
that the fountain has no place
on our street.

303
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:15,700
Yeah, we gotta show those gays
we mean business.

304
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,700
Ida, again, the issue is not
bob and lee being gay.

305
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,300
It's the fountain.

306
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Well, can't it be both?

307
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,100
Anyway...

308
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,100
if you elect me president,
my first act

309
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,300
will be to eliminate
this so-called work of art.

310
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,700
Hear, hear.

311
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,200
Yes, lynette.

312
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,800
After you get rid of
this fountain, that's it, right?

313
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,100
I don't follow.

314
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,100
I mean...
you're not gonna start

315
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,700
checking everyone's yards
for things that don't fit in?

316
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,200
Oh, of course not.

317
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,100
As long as those things meet
the association's guidelines.

318
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:56,000
Uh-huh.
And what if they don't?

319
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,300
Are you referring
to something in particular?

320
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:02,400
My kids' tree house. Can you
promise you'll leave it alone?

321
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,400
Well, it's not up to me.
That's the whole point.

322
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
There are rules.

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,900
That sounds like a no.

324
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,000
If i make an exception for you,

325
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,000
then i have to make one
for everyone,

326
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,500
and surely, you realize
that the whole neighborhood

327
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,200
can't revolve
around your little tree house.

328
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,200
Now since
i am running unopposed,

329
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,000
i just need someone
to second my nomination.

330
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh! Thank you, lynette.

331
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,700
No, actually,
i'm nominating myself.

332
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,700
I am now running
for president...

333
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,300
against you.

334
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
You know, running for president
in your condition?

335
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
I don't think
it's a good idea.

336
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,100
Tom, i don't want your opinion,
just your vote.

337
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
If you want
to save the tree house,

338
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,000
why don't you let me
run instead?

339
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,400
Because you'd never win.
Bossy women rule this street.

340
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,900
You know that.
I know one rules my life.

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

342
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Nothing.

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,100
Iook, this is not just about
a tree house or a fountain.

344
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,600
This is about

345
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,600
what kind of neighborhood
we want to live in.

346
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,600
Do we get to make
our own choices,

347
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,700
or do we let the taste police
make them for us?

348
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:21,400
Ah, now i get it. This about you
wanting to take on katherine.

349
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,600
No! This is
about personal freedom...

350
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,300
specifically,
my personal freedom

351
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
to take down
that jackbood hausfrau.

352
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,200
Honey, if you're looking
for something to fight,

353
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,700
how about your cancer?

354
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,700
Hey, a tumor is a tumor

355
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:38,800
whether it's in your body
or living acrosshe street.

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
I don't know
why you buy those things.

357
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,600
They just end up on the floor.

358
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:50,000
Because i want to feel
pretty and feminine.

359
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,000
Ooh! My chili cheese fries!
Just a second!

360
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Gabrielle?
It's me... john.

361
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,900
John? John who?

362
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Uh, okay.
You kn that old friend

363
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:06,800
i ran into in the lobby?

364
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,600
It might have been
john rowland.

365
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,800
Maybe. I'm not sure.

366
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,800
Gabrielle?

367
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,800
But just to be safe, you may
wanna hide in the closet.

368
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:19,500
-What? I'm not hiding
from that guy.
-Really?

369
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,000
Because his father-in-law
goes hunting with victor...

370
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,000
you know,
the guy who hired someone

371
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,700
to tail us and possibly kill us?

372
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

373
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
John, what are you doing here?

374
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,000
When i ran into you
last fall,

375
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,000
you wanted to start up
our affair again,

376
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,500
and i wasn't ready.

377
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,700
Well, i'm ready.

378
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Mm! Mm.

379
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,300
Hey.

380
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,300
Listen, i promised tom
i wouldn't knock myself out

381
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,800
campaigning
for this homeowners thing,

382
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,200
so i was hoping
you could help me...

383
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:09,100
you know, ring some bells,
talk me up, that sort of thing?

384
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:11,500
I would love to, but...

385
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
but what?

386
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,400
This is awkward.

387
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:17,900
Uh, i told katherine
i'd vote for her.

388
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,200
You're picking her over me?

389
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Uh, it's not like
i'm pro-katherine.

390
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm just anti-fountain.

391
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, don't give me that look.
I made her a promise.

392
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Yes, but that was
before your best friend

393
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,900
threw her scarf in the ring.

394
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:34,100
Uh...

395
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,300
okay. If i vote for you,

396
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,600
do you promi
to get rid of that fountain?

397
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:41,900
See, that's awkward for me.
This is about personal freedom.

398
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,000
You know? I'm running
as a libertarian.

399
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,800
Well, i'm voting
as a light sleeper.

400
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,400
It's right outside
our bedroom window.

401
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Seriously, lynette, it's like
living next to splash mountain.

402
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,900
But it's my kids' tree house.
They really need it.
Well, we need our sleep.

403
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,300
Why don't you get earplugs?

404
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,700
Why don't you get...
tree house plugs?

405
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,900
What? That doesn't
even make sense.

406
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,400
Yeah, i'm sorry.

407
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:06,300
You know,
tired people aren't witty.

408
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,800
Seriously, john, you have
got to get out of here.

409
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
No. Please.
I need to be with you.

410
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:16,200
What about your wife?
You met her.
She's dumb, demanding,

411
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,800
totally self-centered,
especially in bed.

412
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,500
I mean, she's awful.

413
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,800
Awfully pregnant.
I know.
I-i'm completely trapped,

414
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,800
just like you were
with mr. Solis.

415
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,300
Wha...

416
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,200
i-i wasn't "trapped."

417
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,900
What do you mean?

418
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:34,400
All you'd ever talk about
was what a selfish pig he was.

419
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,400
Well, i think
you're paraphrasing.

420
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,400
Okay, riously,
you have to go.

421
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:41,400
Come on. You know it would
be hot, just like old times.

422
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:46,500
Remember how great
our sex was?
Oh, i don't think

423
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,200
what about the time we were
doing it in the shower?

424
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,200
Mr. Solis drove up?
Uh, does not ring a bell.

425
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Come on.
And i hid in the closet?

426
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:59,200
And you looked so hot, mr. Solis
pulled you down on the bed.

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,600
And you had to fake an orgasm
just so he wouldn't catch on.

428
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,500
Yeah, good times.

429
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,700
Anyways, uh, that's a negatory
on the affair...
what?

430
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,700
And i will see you later.

431
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:15,700
Come on, but we're so good
together. Gab...

432
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
please!

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,100
Boy, that was a close one, huh?

434
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,100
You faked it with me

435
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,500
while that wax job
was hiding in the closet?

436
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes, i had an affair.
Old news. Move on.

437
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,600
Where's that room service?
So you're not gonna apologize

438
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,100
for humiliating me
in my own bed?

439
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
You deserved it. All you cared
about back then was work.

440
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Hey, i was not that bad
of a husband,

441
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,400
and somebody had to support
your italian shoe addiion.

442
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,700
I shopped because
i was bored and lonely...

443
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,900
same reason i had an affair.
Yeah,
with our teenage gardener!

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
I should have snapped
that kid's neck two years ago.

445
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:58,200
Oh, let it go! John Rowland
didn't do anything to you

446
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
that you're not doing
to Victor.

447
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:03,600
You can't even compare the two!
It's completely different!

448
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,700
Is it, Mr. Man in the closet?

449
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah, you heard me.

450
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:11,600
Who's John Rowland now?

451
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
Katherine,
what are you up to?

452
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,800
Just visiting a friend.

453
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:29,100
Liar. You're campaigning.
Cookies... nice touch.

454
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,500
Ditto on the scarf.

455
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,800
Edie, you got a moment?

456
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,300
I am running for president
of the homeowners' association,

457
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,900
and i want to talk to you
abouthat horrible founin.

458
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:46,400
Screw the untain.
You want my support?

459
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,400
Make ida greenberg ditch
that screen door.

460
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,800
That rusty,
old tetanus bucket...

461
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,800
Iooks fine to me.
It's hardly ripped at all.

462
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,100
In fact, if you give me
your support...

463
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,300
i'll make mrs. Burkette
prune those roses.

464
00:22:58,341 --> 00:23:00,500
It's a garden, not a jungle,

465
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,500
and <i>you</i> shouldn't have to...

466
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,500
pay for a fence
you don't even want.

467
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,100
That's not how you make
good neighbors,

468
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
and i don't care if...
the mustafas
don't celebrate christmas.

469
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,700
You're asking them to hang
a few lights, not convert.

470
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,500
When i'm president, i promise...

471
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,500
you can keep
that satellite dish.

472
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
In fact, this is practically
a first amendment issue.

473
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,400
The way i see it...

474
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,000
the entire neighborhood

475
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,900
should be a testament
to symmetry and beauty.

476
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,100
So...

477
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,100
have i got your vote?

478
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,100
Um, i'm not sure yet.

479
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,500
Keep rubbing.

480
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Bree, i know you're upset,
but you've got to eat.

481
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm just so mad at myself.

482
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:49,800
I should have realized

483
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,800
that the maternal instinct
is so strong,

484
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:54,000
that even danielle
would develop it.

485
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,300
What's so funny?

486
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,900
You know those animals
who eat their young?

487
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,900
Even they have more maternal
instinct than danielle.

488
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,900
Then why
would she want the child?

489
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:09,100
You've known her how long,
and you still haven't

490
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,900
figured out how that lentil
she calls a brain works?

491
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:15,400
There's no need
to insult your sister.
Let him talk.

492
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,800
All right, danielle cares
about three things...

493
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,700
danielle, fun, and, uh...

494
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,900
wait. I was wrong.
It's just two.

495
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,800
And a retirement village
is fun?

496
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,800
Compared to what
you're offering her...

497
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,900
a crappy job
and community college.

498
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:33,700
I mean, you think grandma's
gonna make her do any of that?

499
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,700
So danielle's only doing this

500
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,900
because phyllis
is offering her a cushy life?

501
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah.
If you want that baby,

502
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,700
you're gonna have
to outbid grandma.

503
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
What are you doing here?

504
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
Hi, john.

505
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:59,800
I wanted to talk to you.

506
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,500
It'll be very friendly.
No hitting.

507
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
What's up?

508
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,800
This is gonna sound weird,
but, uh,

509
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,000
i've been doing some
thinking lately, and, well,

510
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
i've decided that it's time
for me to forgive you.

511
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,900
For sleeping with my wife.

512
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,800
Yeah, well, i didn't
just sleep with gaby.

513
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,900
I fell in love with her.

514
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,300
I forgive you for that,
too.

515
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Why are you doing this?

516
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:44,300
You in some kind
of 12-step program?

517
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Let's just say i've recently
learned how loving someone

518
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:52,700
makes you forget the difference
between right and wrong.

519
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Anyway, that's pretty much it.
I should go.

520
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:03,900
Hey.

521
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,100
Do you still talk
to gabrielle?

522
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,700
Occasionally. Why?

523
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:12,400
I just want to know
if she was happy.

524
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,200
I think she is.

525
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,700
Well...

526
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:22,400
good for her.

527
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
All right, before we vote,

528
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:34,600
are there any more questions
for the candidates?

529
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,900
Anybody besides lee?

530
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:38,400
It's not a question.

531
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,400
I just want
to remind everyone

532
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,200
that a vote for katherine
is a vote for fascism.

533
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,100
What is it with you gay people
and clothes?

534
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,400
Fascism, ida, not fashion.

535
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,300
Although if you ever
do want to talk fashion,

536
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:54,700
we're here for you.

537
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,700
All right, debate's over.

538
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,100
Let's kick this pig.
All in favor of lynette?

539
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay,
and those for katherine?

540
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,600
That's 14 for lynette
and 14 for katherine.

541
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,100
So what do we do? It's a tie.

542
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,600
Ah!

543
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,100
No, it's not.

544
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,700
Susan voted twice.

545
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Did i?

546
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:35,300
Well, that's obviously wrong.

547
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:38,000
You only get one vote,
sweet cheeks. Who's it gonna be?

548
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,900
Susan, we're waiting.

549
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,900
It's up to you, hon.

550
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,400
Katherine.

551
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,700
Oh!

552
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,200
Okay, it's official.
Katherine is our new president.

553
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone,

554
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,000
and i promise to do my best
for this neighborhood.

555
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,300
And, bob, lee, mr. Mustafa,

556
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,500
i'll be in touch regarding
your various infractions.

557
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,700
Oh.

558
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,600
And you, too, lynette.

559
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Meeting adjourned.

560
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,700
Oh.

561
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,700
I know.
Well, i'm not surprised.

562
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
You know, phyllis,

563
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,700
we cannot thank you enough
for accepting r apology.

564
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:58,700
Well, i think we should try
to stay on good terms

565
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:01,500
for danielle's sake.

566
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm glad you suggested
that we eat out here.

567
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I never think to do this.

568
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,100
Oh, darn,
i forgot the napkins.

569
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
Oh, no problem.

570
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,100
I'll go get some.

571
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,000
So now that we have
a moment alone,

572
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:21,400
your mother and i would like
to say how proud we are of you.

573
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,900
Yeah, right.

574
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:26,600
Seriously, we hadn't realized
you'd matured enough

575
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,400
to take on the burden
of motherhood all by yourself.

576
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,700
Well, grandma's gonna help.

577
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:34,700
She'll do what she can,
but you mustn't overtax her.

578
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,000
Her heart is not very strong.

579
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,900
She seems fine to me.

580
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,400
Well, knock wood.

581
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,200
We'd hate to see you forced
to take care of a baby

582
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,300
<i>and</i> a sick old woman.

583
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:48,400
Whoa! Mah-jongg.
Don't see that much anymore.

584
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,500
Hey, hey.

585
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,500
Danielle,
you should introduce yourself.

586
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,200
These people
are your new friends.
Mm.

587
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,200
And you're going to
learn more

588
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,200
from their experience
and wisdom

589
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,000
than you ever could have learned
at that college in florida.

590
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,800
Wait. I thought
i couldn't go there.

591
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:09,800
You said it was
just a party school.

592
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,800
Well, actually, we checked
into the curriculum,

593
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:14,200
and it's very strong,
but no matter.

594
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,600
You' be happier here.
Yes, and with a grandmother's
unconditional love,

595
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:19,900
who needs frat boys who only
like you for your convertible?

596
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Whoa. When did i get
a convertible?

597
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,900
Well, we were gonna surprise you
with one for your birthday,

598
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,400
but since you're keeping
the baby, you'll want

599
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:30,400
a more practical gift.
We're thinking
a diaper service.

600
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, look,
they have water aerobics.

601
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,100
Up!

602
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:37,200
Out. Out.

603
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,400
You should sign up.

604
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,700
You know, maybe i <i>should</i>
go to college.

605
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,700
I mean, for the by's sake.

606
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
How can i support it
without a degree?

607
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:54,800
But you can't raise this child
in a miami dorm room.

608
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:57,700
You'll need to leave it
with someone you can trust

609
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,500
to take care of it properly.

610
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:03,800
Sorry.

611
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,800
The elevator's out. I...

612
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:08,300
oh. I have to catch my breath.

613
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,900
Grandma?

614
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:19,500
We need to talk.

615
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,300
What's this?

616
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,200
I thought we might toast
my victory.

617
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

618
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,500
Oh.

619
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:43,000
So... you haven't
congratulated me yet.

620
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,800
I know.

621
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,800
Would you like to tell me
what's bothering you?

622
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,800
I just want you to think
about what you've been doing

623
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,900
for the past few days.

624
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:56,600
You've mounted a crusade
against a metal thing

625
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
that shoots out water.
I'm trying to keep
the neighborhood beautiful.

626
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,800
I love this street.

627
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,600
Yeah, you keep saying that...
how happy you used to be here,

628
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,600
but ever since
we've moved back,

629
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,600
all i've seen
is an unhappy woman

630
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,600
who needs
to control everything.

631
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,100
Well... we've both learned
what happens

632
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,800
when you lose control.

633
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh. Chicago again.

634
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,900
Tell you something else
we learned there.

635
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:24,900
When the chips are down,
it helps to have friends.

636
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:29,000
And you certainly
haven't made us any lately.

637
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,000
Congratulations.

638
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,900
Bye, grandma.

639
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,500
Good-bye, dear.

640
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:46,000
Tell your stepfather
i'll be right out.

641
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,300
Ohplease, phyllis.
Even you have to agree

642
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,300
that a girl who'd trade
her baby for a convertible

643
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,100
isn't ready for motherhood.

644
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:02,500
She'd have changed
once the baby came.

645
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,200
She's her father's daughter.

646
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,700
That's a nice picture
of rex.

647
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,400
Oh, i have
a lot of pictures.

648
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:16,400
All of the women here do.

649
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,900
They're what we have left
of the things

650
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:22,900
time has taken from us...

651
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,300
youth, homes and husbands...

652
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,500
and for the unluckiest,
children.

653
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:39,500
I thought i was getting back
a part of rex.

654
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:41,900
But now...

655
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,500
i know you're lonely,
phyllis,

656
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,800
but i can't give up this child
just to make you feel better.

657
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:54,600
You should go.
Your <i>family's</i> waiting for you.

658
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,300
Orson and i go to our club
almost every saturday night,

659
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:10,100
if you're... interested
in babysitting.

660
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:12,800
You mean it?

661
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,300
How will you explain me
to your friends?

662
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:20,100
I'll say that you're broke
and needed the money.

663
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,500
Can't you just say that
you like having me around?

664
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,400
I need something
that will fly, phyllis.

665
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
Hey. What's going on?

666
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,400
We need to talk.

667
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
So here's the deal.

668
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,900
I think it's time for us
to do the right thing.

669
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:52,900
I don't think
i like where this is going.

670
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:54,900
We have to end this affair.

671
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:56,200
You serious?

672
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,800
All this... sneaking around,
wearing disguises,

673
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,800
hiding in closets...
it's just wrong.

674
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,600
We're better than this.

675
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,000
So what are you suggesting,
we stay with victor and edie?

676
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,600
No, we break up with <i>them.</i>

677
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,900
Iook, it'll hurt,
but at least it's honest.

678
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:15,800
And then when enough time has
gone by and they've moved on,

679
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:17,300
we can be together.

680
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,200
How long
are we talking about?

681
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I don't know. Six months?

682
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,300
Six months? Nobody takes
that long to heal anymore.

683
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,300
It's a breakup,
not a face-lift.

684
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
Hey, look, i want us
to be together, too,

685
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,000
but i also wanna
feel good about it.

686
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,000
Don't you?

687
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,900
Yeah. I do.

688
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:43,600
You're such
a good guy, carlos.

689
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,100
I really hate that about you.

690
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:47,900
I know.

691
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,100
So... i guess this is it.

692
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,900
This kiss has to last
six months.

693
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:01,100
You better make it good.

694
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,900
His guy can fly.
My guy freeze.

695
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,700
Hey, lynette.

696
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,700
Hey, judas.

697
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,700
Okay, fine.
You're still angry,

698
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:31,700
but i'm gonna make it up
to you.

699
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,700
When they come after
that tree house,

700
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,200
they're going to have
one susan mayer chained to it.

701
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:39,500
Don't do that. I wanna be sad
when they knock it down.
Lynette!

702
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,000
What? You think
you can just walk over here

703
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,900
and cute your way
out of what you did?

704
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,000
We're supposed to be friends.
Exactly,

705
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,900
and friends don't put friends
in this kind of position.

706
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,800
I love you,
but you can't ask me

707
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,300
to put your kids
ahead of my husband.

708
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:56,900
No, parker, that guy
doesn't have freezing...

709
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,400
you're right.
I shouldn't have done that.

710
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,500
But that tree house is
the one place my kids can go

711
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,700
and not hear about body scans
and white blood cell counts.

712
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:12,800
It is their getaway
from this horrible thing

713
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,800
that i've brought
into the house.

714
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,900
"Brought"? Sweetie, it's not
your fault that you're sick.

715
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,800
I know that... here.
But here...

716
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,200
it feels like
i've ruined their childhood.

717
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Okay, if anybody needs me,

718
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:32,400
i'll be at the hardware ore
buying chains.

719
00:37:32,441 --> 00:37:34,600
Oh, jeez. Get over here.

720
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,600
Hello there!

721
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, look, it's our new queen...
katherine of arrogant.

722
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,500
Hey,
where's the wrecking ball?

723
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,300
Actually, i came to tell you
the tree house can stay.

724
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,200
Oh, my god.
That's great!

725
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,300
Yes. If anyone complains,
we'll say

726
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,400
it was grandfathered in under
the previous administration.

727
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,800
Wow.

728
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,500
Thanks. Why?

729
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,100
Clearly,
it means a lot to you,

730
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:05,300
and i wanna be
a good neighbor.

731
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Katherine.

732
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
What's with you? Sometimes you
act like an ice queen,

733
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,400
and then you do
something really nice.

734
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,100
You are
one complicated lady.

735
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,600
Well, i've had
one complicated life.

736
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I've had a lot of men
in my life,

737
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:34,200
but i never let myself
fall in love before.

738
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I thought it was because
i didn't wanna get hurt,

739
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:41,000
but... now i know
the pain you feel

740
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,300
isn't the worst part.

741
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:46,400
It's the hate.

742
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,800
Could you make it out
to "cash"?

743
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,600
Hello, katherine.

744
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,600
You here about the fountain?

745
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:11,100
Yes, but don't worry.
There's no strict deadline.

746
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,400
You can... have it removed
at your earliest convenience.

747
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:18,700
Yeah, i don't think
it's going anywhere.

748
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:22,600
Oh, boys, boys,
the war's over.

749
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,400
Yes, it is.

750
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,600
We know
all about chicago.

751
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,900
Come again?

752
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:32,400
My ex is on the board
of chicago memorial hospital.

753
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:34,900
Seems your husband
made quite a stir there...

754
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,700
whole hospital still
buzzing about what he did.

755
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,200
Whatever you heard
is a vicious lie...

756
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,700
every word of it.

757
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,100
Still, it was enough to...
make you leave town,

758
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:53,700
which begs the question,
do you like living here?

759
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Oh, good. We're in agreement.
The fountain stays.

760
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,200
Thanks for stopping by,
katherine.

761
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,400
<i>It's the same for all of us.</i>

762
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,100
<i>We try not to get too close</i>

763
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,700
<i>to the people</i>
<i>who live next door.</i>

764
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>It's easier to give them</i>
<i>a polite nod</i>

765
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,100
<i>than to ask what's wrong.</i>

766
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,600
<i>It's safer to keep walking by</i>
<i>than to get involved.</i>

767
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
...you right now.
Okay, i don't wanna work...

768
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,400
<i>true, we sometimes do</i>
<i>get to know the people</i>

769
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,600
<i>we share a fence with</i>
<i>and end up lifelong friends.</i>

770
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:44,100
Thanks for everything.
Thank you.

771
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,300
<i>But mostly,</i>
<i>we keep our distance</i>

772
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,400
<i>because we'd rather</i>
<i>our neighbors</i>

773
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:52,000
<i>know nothing about us...</i>

774
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,000
<i>than know too much.</i>
