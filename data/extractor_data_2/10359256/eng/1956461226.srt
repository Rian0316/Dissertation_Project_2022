- No!

If you won't accept
this simple gift,

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,478
then what does that say
about our future?

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,730

I don't know if
you're seeing anyone these days,

11

some cheering up.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,113
I was... seeing someone.

00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,802
- Duke is gonna kill Teacup.
- Teacup?

00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,679
Our dog. He says
if I don't meet with him,

What?

108
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,874
I told him that
there was a chance

109
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,376
that I could be
booking this gig,

110
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,336
and he already agreed to come.

111
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,047
- Oh.
- I'll put you two at a table together.

112
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,217
That way you can get
to know each other.

113
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,511
Can't wait.

114
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,932
You'll have to help me
find something to wear.

00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,226
(chuckles) I'm thinking
maybe that blue dress

116
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,062
- with the sequins.
- Oh, yes, that's nice.

117

118
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,026

- Mm, to...

fix her bunion.

122
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
I agreed to bring her
home from the hospital

123
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,620
and look after her.
All night.

124
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,247
Well, can you get someone else
to look after her?

You can't miss my show.

You don't want to meet him

132
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,098

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,323
and my husband, who is gay.

182
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,371
Well, I got to give you points
for creativity.

183
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,791
Have fun, kid.

184
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,094
Eli! Hey, can you
walk Teacup for me?

185
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,888
I'm helping Taylor
pack for her trip.

186
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,223
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

187
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,807
Still going to Fresno, huh?

188
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,810
I have to. This conference has
been on the books for months.

189
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,687
Honey, the people at your firm
know that we were attacked.

190
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,106
I mean, they wouldn't blink
if you opted out.

191
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,651
I know, but I told my sisters
I'm coming to town,

192
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,736
and they're still threatening
to visit this summer,

193
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,780
so we kind of want
to break the news

194
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,990
about our living situation
before that happens.

195
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,117
Why don't you
just shoot them a text?

196
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,745
- I'm not gonna tell my sisters I'm in a throuple via text.
- Yeah.

197
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,497
Just make sure you tell them
it was your idea, not mine.

198
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
- But it <i>was</i> your idea.
- ELI: Yeah,

199
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,833
but your sisters
hate me enough as it is.

200
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,794
We don't need to throw
any more gas on that fire.

201
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,132
You haven't met them yet,
but they're awful.

202
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,635
All right, Teacup.

203
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,136
Whoa, here we go.

204
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,764
Yeah.
(exhales)

205
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,851
- Lamar.
- Oh!

206
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,603
You <i>do</i> know who I am.

207
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,146
I was curious

208
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,648
'cause you've been avoiding me
for weeks.

209
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,316
No, no, no. No, I...
(stammers)

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,527
I-I was absolutely
gonna call you back, man.

211
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,570
I just...
I've been incredibly busy.

212
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,614
I see you had time to get a dog.

213
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,824
Oh, forgot to tell you.

214
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,158
You'll like this.

215
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,119
Finally had that threesome.

216
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,663
I would ask what one has to do
with the other,

217
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,998
but never the fuck mind.

218
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,333
- Where is my script?
- Script?

219
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,627
The one you promised
would be done a month ago?

220
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,296
The one I talked up
to Paramount.

221
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,131
Got 'em all excited,
and now they're pissed off

222
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,632
wondering what happened to it.

223
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,009
Well, it-it's almost done.

224
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,344
I'm just... making
a few final tweaks.

225
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,971
Oh, please.

226
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,473
The only line older than that
is "let there be light."

227
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,559
No, I'm not lying.
Look, I-I swear to you...

228
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,519
I swear to you, I will have it
to you in one week.

229
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,147
No. You got 24 hours.

230
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,524
Starting now.

231
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,693
Come on, man, we're
supposed to be friends.

232
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,361
Look, I am your friend.
Any other agent would have

233
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,071
kicked your ass
to the curb long ago.

234
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,239
Okay, well, yeah, and of course,

235
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,699
I'm grateful
that you stood by me,

236
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,743
but please, I mean...
Give me till Friday.

237
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,703
You got till 10:15 tomorrow.

238
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,663
Tweak fast.

239
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,209
Are you having an affair?

240
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,545
Really, Karl, before breakfast?

241
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,297
No, I heard you on
the phone this morning.

242
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,424
You were arguing
with someone,

243
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,053
refusing to meet unless they
found a discreet location.

244
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,597
You listened to
a private conversation?

245
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,849
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Well, I am...

246
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,268
after I've had sex
with a busboy in an alleyway,

247
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,063
but I-I don't really break
a sweat over eavesdropping.

248
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,065
Regardless, I don't owe you
any explanations,

249
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,566
- so drop the subject.
- Oh, go on.

250
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,068
Tell me who it is.

251
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,111
Is it one of our friends
from the country club?

252
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,989
The tennis instruct...
No, the chef.

253
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,700
Karl, I believe you're jealous.

254
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,243
Oh, don't be daft.

255
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,828
Oh, by the way,

256
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,247
if it is a busboy
named Julio,

257
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,416
will you give him
my regards?

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,461
- (doorbell rings)
- Mm, the irony is just delicious.

259
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,254
Is it one of our neighbors?

260
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,590
Dig all you like, Karl.

261
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,133
Even if I were
having an affair,

262
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,053
you'd never hear
his name from me.

263
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,640
We need to talk
about Tommy.

264
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,186
The bed news is
he's been acting strangely.

265
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,772
He leaves the house
at all hours of the night.

266
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,941
Won't tell me where he's been
when he comes home.

267
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,444
Oh, I do home Tommy hasn't
fallen in with the wrong crowd.

268
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,113
Why are you looking at me?

269
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,448
- I'm offering you a cookie.
- Oh.

270
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,283
Right.

271
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,412
The good news is
I got him a new job

272
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,122
working for Bader's Nursery.

273
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,665
He'll be doing home care.

274
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,458
- Home care?
- That means he'll go

275
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,293
into people's houses
and water their plants

276
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,294
while they're at work

277
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,838
or on vacation.

278
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,089
Will he?

279
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,632
This is where
the favor comes in.

280
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,427
I'm asking all of my friends
to hire Tommy.

281
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,345
I need to keep him busy.

282
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,140
Just so I'm clear,
people leave town

283
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,808
and give Tommy
the keys to their homes?

284
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,769
I know what you're thinking,
but Tommy is

285
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,439
very trustworthy...
and quick, too.

286
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,607
He'd be in and out.

287
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,485
I'm sure he'd stay long enough
to get the job done.

288
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,487
(chuckling):
Of course.

289
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,614
Can I count you in?

290
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,782
Oh, why not?

291
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,075
We like Tommy,
don't we, darling?

292
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,660
Oh, yes.

293
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,121
We certainly do.

294
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,330
BETH ANN:
Poor April.

295
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,124
If you could
have seen her face.

296
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,959
Oh, you don't want me
anywhere near that tramp's face

297
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,794
because I will slap it.

298
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,171
It's her big night.

299
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,964
I was honored she wanted me
to come so badly.

300
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,841
Doesn't she have
any other friends?

301
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,469
Or did she sleep
with their husbands, too?

302
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm glad Rob is going.

303
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,805
She needs someone there
to cheer her on.

304
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,182
I don't get it.

305
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,558
This is war.

306
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,351
You are fighting
with another woman

307
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,854
over your husband
and you are losing.

308
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,731
- (door closes)
- ROB: Honey!

309
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,192
He's home early.
I'm in here, Rob.

310
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,860
If he tells you that he's got
to work late Tuesday,

311
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,528
I will vomit
and you will have to mop

312
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,530
this floor up all over again.

313
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,032
There you are.
Guess what?

314
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,743
I have amazing news.

315
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,869
You do?

316
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,747
I got two tickets
to the World Series.

317
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,873
For when?

318
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,542
Let me guess. Tuesday?

319
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,419
ROB:
As a matter of fact, yeah.

320
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,505
My boss gave them to me
as a gift, and they

321
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,466
- are right behind home plate.
- Who are you taking?

322
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,675
What do you mean,
who am I taking?

323
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,885
Only my best girl.

324
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,553
Let me see those.

325
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,182
- Holy crap!
- (Rob chuckles)

326
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,935
He's got two tickets
to the World Series.

327
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,019
Isn't that what I just said?

328
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,062
And these are for Tuesday?

329
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,064
Yeah.

330
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,398
ROB:
What's wrong?

331
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,109
Well, I just want to make sure

332
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,654
we haven't forgotten
about any plans

333
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,240
we might have made for Tuesday?

334
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,867
Well, whatever plans we made,
consider them canceled.

335
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,162
I've got a date with my wife,
the Dodgers and the Yankees.

336
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,164
Okay.

337
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,208
What's going on here?
Why aren't you happy?

338
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,586
Oh, she is very happy.

339
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,256
She's just not used
to you being so wonderful.

340
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,674
Oh.

341
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,883
Huh?

342
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,844
Rob, give us a second. We're not
through with the mopping.

343
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,390
I got to call Carl.

344
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,101
He's gonna be so
jealous. (laughs)

345
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,813
April is going
to be heartbroken.

346
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,565
To hell with April.

347
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,942
You've got to focus
on the big picture.

348
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,821
He's choosing you
over her.

349
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,031
You're winning.

350
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,243
I guess I am.

351
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
♪ ♪

352
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,964
JADE:
Hey. Taylor called.

353
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,341
Her plane landed
in Fresno.

354
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,595
What are you doing?

355
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,640
Killing myself.

356
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,642
- With cheese?
- Yeah. My plan is

357
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,353
to get super fat
and then die of hypertension.

358
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,647
That might take a while.

359
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,525
Only great writers
deserve quick deaths.

360
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,028
Hemingway, Wolfe, Plath.

361
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,822
Me? I'm a bad writer,

362
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,158
so I deserve
to die slowly,

363
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,620
painfully... disgustingly.

364
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,998
Do we have any mustard?

365
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,750
No.

366
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,668
But we have mayonnaise.

367
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,338
Oh, yes, the condiment of hacks.

368
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,882
Bring it to me.

369
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,510
What's going on?

370
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,349
My agent's gonna drop me

371
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,517
if I don't get him my script
by tomorrow morning.

372
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,479
And you're not finished?

373
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,399
I-I've written 50 pages.
Each just worst than the last.

374
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,151
I doubt that.

375
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,736
I mean, I have no third act.

376
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,237
I keep sitting here,

377
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,697
staring at the poster
of my one and only hit,

378
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,783
praying for some sort
of inspiration.

379
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,243
And the longer I look at it,
the more I realize...

380
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,870
it was a fluke.

381
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,830
I mean, brilliant
director, stellar cast,

382
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,916
all turning my crap dialogue
into gold.

383
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,712
(exhales)
How am I gonna tell Taylor

384
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,923
that I lost my fucking agent?

385
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,093
Give me the 50 pages.

386
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,011
Why, so you can
beat me with them?

387
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,390
Because I think it might help
you to get some honest feedback.

388
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,935
Do you know anything
about writing?

389
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,728
I know what I like.

390
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,897
And if I think that
your script's in decent shape,

391
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,777
you'll have the confidence
to finish the damn thing.

392
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,988
Yeah, and what if it's just
50 pages of me shitting the bed?

393
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,325
Then I will go to the store
and I will buy you

394
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,245
every kind of cheese
known to man.

395
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,539
And mayonnaise.

396
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,624
Gonna need lots of mayonnaise.

397
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,087
Rob, what are you doing?
We're going to be late.

398
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,089
I'm looking
for my old baseball glove.

399
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,591
Maybe I can get Sandy Koufax
to sign it.

400
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,594
Don't bother Mr. Koufax tonight.
He'll be working.

401
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,221
Eh, he can sign one glove.

402
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,724
Maybe it's in one of the boxes
in the garage.

403
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,308
- (phone ringing)
- No, it should be in this one.

404
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
Stanton residence.

405
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,146
Hold on.

406
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,773
Maybe you're right
about the garage.

407
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,777
Check the box by the tool
drawer. I got to take this.

408
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,446
Who is it?

409
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,198
Uh, a guy from work.
Uh, I'll be right down.

410
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,913
(door creaking softly)

411
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,466
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

412
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,051
I said never
to call me here.

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,638
I already told you,
I got plans with my wife.

414
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,348
She's making me
take her out to dinner.

415
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,437
Don't cry. L-Look,
I hate it when you cry.

416
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,855
There's nothing
I can do about this.

417
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
Now-now I got to go.

418
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,789
Well, you were right
about the garage.

419
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,373
No sign of your glove.

420
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,833
Eh, it doesn't matter.
Let's get going

421
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,835
or we'll miss
the national anthem.

422
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,837
Honey, I don't think I can go.

423
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,005
What?

424
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,549
I'm not feeling well.

425
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,842
You look fine to me.

426
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
Robert.

427
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,971
You remember our trip
to New Mexico?

428
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,848
You mean, you got...

429
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,018
Yes. I should stay close
to a bathroom.

430
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,686
Well, they got bathrooms
at the stadium.

431
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,815
I could never do that
to total strangers.

432
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,026
Want me to stay
home with you?

433
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,028
Don't be silly.

434
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,073
(laughs): Oh, good. Thank God,
'cause I really want to go.

435
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,074
Bye.

436
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,159

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,498
April, it's Sheila.

438
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,500
My aunt is fine.

439
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,878
I can come hear you sing
after all.

440
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,507
Yes. I'm happy, too.

441
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,260
(laughter)

442
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,553
Ah.

443
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,137
It is so good

444
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,389
to see you guys.

445
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,723
I just wish Mama
could've made it.

446
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,891
How is she?

447
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,185
- Nasty as ever.
- Mean as the day is long.

448
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,729
We work our fingers
to the bone for that woman.

449
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,731
But it's never good
enough for her.

450
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,775
VELMA: The doctor says
she could live to be 100.

451
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,778
And she'll do it,
just to spite us.

452
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,281
Well, look, I know she can be
difficult to care for,

453
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,032
and I wish
I could help out more.

454
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,409
Oh, don't worry about it, sugar.

455
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,995
- We don't resent you.
- Not much, anyway.

456
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,080
Would be nice if you could
take her off our hands

457
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,582
every now and then.

458
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,084
Got an extra room
in that big house of yours?

459
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,544
Don't need to be fancy.

460
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,129
Oh, it could be the
cellar for all we care.

461
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,881
(both grunt)

462
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,593
I would really like to help out,
but it would be tricky,

463
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,053
given my current
living situation.

464
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,930
Okay, I meant to lead
with this when I sat down,

465
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,100
but the truth is...

466
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,269
I am no longer in
an open marriage.

467
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,146
- You left Eli?
- Thank you, Jesus.

468
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:54,359
No, I didn't leave Eli, I
moved my lover into our home.

What's wrong with Eva?

509
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,298
She waits around for 15 pages
hoping a man will save her.

510
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,051
She's a victim. I hate victims.

511
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,223
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean,
make her more proactive, sure.

512
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,808
And can't she do
something interesting

513
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,393
to get out of trouble?

514
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,396
- What do you mean, interesting?
- Like, on page 40,

515
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,110
she's abandoned at the diner
and totally broke, right?

516
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,112
- Yeah.
- So, let her

517
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
steal the owner's truck

518
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,949
and then she drives
to the drug dealer's house

519
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,743
and starts a fire.

520
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,078
And when he runs
out the front,

521
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,454
she goes in the back
and gets the money

522
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,705
that he took from her.

523
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,915
And his gun.

524
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,917
She'd definitely take his gun.

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,588
Wow. Um, I mean, i-it's
definitely more proactive.

526
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,467

I-I never saw Eva that way.

she's a nice girl.

00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,473
Yeah, but nice girls,
they break the law every day.

529
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,185
When they need to.

530
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,814
Okay. All right, I hear you.

531
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,441
There's more to Eva
than meets the eye.

532
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,318
Exactly.

533
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:28,031
So now, get started, open
your laptop, get to work.

534
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,283
You have 22 hours.

535
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,285
(exhales)

536
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,663
Hey.

537
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,540
How did you come up
with that stuff, anyway?

538
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,378
Maybe there's more to <i>me</i>
than meets the eye.

539
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,138
(keyboard clacking)

540
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,689
TOMMY: Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

541
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,316
It's okay.
Are you clear on what to do?

542
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,026
I guess.

543
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,320
Are we sure about this?
I mean, if we get caught...

544
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,739
Yes. It's very risky.

545
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,200
I suppose the smart thing
to do is end this affair

546
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,327
and never have sex again.

547
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,579
Fine.

548
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,539

00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,302
I don't know why
Mrs. Dubner's bed feels amazing.

565
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,889
It's the sheets.
They're Egyptian cotton.

566
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,140
How do you know that?

567
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,558
I used to wash
sheets like this

568
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,268
when I worked in
my father's laundry.

569
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,437
Your dad owned a laundry?

570
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,357
You think I was born rich?

571
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,317
Well... yeah.

572
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,904
(laughs)
Not even close.

573
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,992
When I was 12, I used
to covet things like this.

574
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,455
Once, I took some
satin sheets home.

575
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,624
I wanted to see
what it felt like

576
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,751
to sleep on them,
just for one night.

577
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,755
My mother caught me.
She was so angry.

578
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,840
She made me wash
and iron them right there.

579
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,175
It was 2:00 in the morning.

580
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,094
And then she took them away.

581
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,644
- That's a shame.
- Mm.

582
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,818
Mother said, "If you want
to sleep on expensive sheets,

583
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,320
choose wisely
who you sleep next to."

584
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,157
So, uh, she basically told you
to marry for money.

585
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,201
That's, uh, some
really bad advice.

586
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,412
Well, I followed it twice.

587
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,749
I didn't think of marrying
for love until Karl.

588
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,587
I never told that story before.

589
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,717
To anyone.

590
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,179
Thanks for telling me first.

591
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,142
If you really want to <i>thank</i> me,

592
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,143
get over here.

593
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,352
(Tommy chuckles)

594
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,562
(Simone chuckles)

595
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,653
Oh, I feel so badly about this.

596
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,990
(groans) After you went
to all the trouble

597
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,034
of taking me to the airport.

598
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,368
It's fine, Joyce.

599
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,536
Nobody expects you
to get on a plane

600
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,538
when you're feeling ill.

601
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,708
Oh, it's the plant van.

602
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,544
Tommy must be here.

603
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,386
So, finally,
I confessed to Eli

604
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,305
how much Jade meant to me,
and he agreed

605
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,141
to let her live
with us, permanently.

606
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,771
Yes, I know,
it's unconventional,

607
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,065
and you probably don't approve,

608
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:34,152
but... it's working.

609
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,571
Well, as long as
you're happy.

610
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,114
That's what matters.

611
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,575
Really?

612
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,118
That's all you have to say?

613
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,288
Since you asked,
I have a question.

614
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,207
- Here we go.
- Do you still love Eli?

615
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,084
- Of course.
- And you also love this woman?

616
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,168
Yes.

617
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,046
I'm wondering, how do they
feel about each other?

618
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,884
Oh. Well...

619
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,260
I knew she hadn't
thought it through.

620
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,262
- Hadn't even crossed her mind.
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,597
Hold on. Eli and Jade
like each other.

622
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,265
That's not a problem.

623
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,601
Not yet. What happens when
he likes her more than you?

624
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,395
What happens when she
gets tired of sharing?

625
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,688
- Where does that leave you, missy?
- On the outside

626
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,607
looking in, that's where.

627
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,817
That's not gonna happen.

628
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,445
It's not.

629
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,864
Obviously, we don't know Jade.

630
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,907
So we can't judge her.

631
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,158
But we know Eli.

632
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,952
We saw what he put you through.

633
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,662
Yes, we went through
a dark time,

634
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,205
but that was two years ago.

635
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,791
"A dark time"?
The man's a drug addict.

636
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,918
Half your savings
went up his nose.

637
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,087
The man's incapable
of self-control.

638
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,297
And now he's got
another woman in his bed?

639
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,841
The hell did you think
was gonna happen?

640
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,135
Stop it!

641
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,261
I know you're trying
to bait me,

642
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,971
but it's not gonna work.

643
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,349
I'm telling you,
Eli has changed.

644
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,644
Oh, baby sister,
men never change.

645
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,813
They just get better
at keeping secrets.

646
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,773
Mm.

647
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,074
Hello?

648
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
It's Mrs. Dubner.

649
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,786
You said she was
going to France.

650
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,121
Yeah, my mom took her
to the airport this morning.

651
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,666
Tommy, where are you?

652
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,377
- Oh!
- You have to hide!

653
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,837
Make the bed.

654
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,173
I can't do both.

655
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,134
I know you think I'm
a ridiculous hypochondriac,

656
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,343
but the pain is real.

657
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,511
- NAOMI: You'll be fine.
- (mouthing words)

658
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,014
You just need to
lie down in your room.

659
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,975
Mrs. Dubner.
Did you miss your flight?

660
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,685
I'm having a migraine.
I need to rest.

661
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,355
No, uh...
you can't go in there.

662
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,690
Why not?

663
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:39,569
I, uh, just sprayed.

664
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,987
Sprayed?

665
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,990
Uh, insecticide.

666
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,202
Your, uh, your ficus had
a white fly.

667
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,370
- I've never seen any white fly.
- Yeah, well, they're...

668
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,831
they're pretty tiny...
see?

669
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,458
Oh, my God. Kill it!

670
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,502
See, I-I didn't know that
you would be back so soon,

671
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,712
so I used a very
strong insecticide.

672
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,839
You inhale those fumes
with a migraine and...

673
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,216
(imitates explosion)

674
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,718
You're right.
I can smell it.

675
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,386
Yeah, y-you better stay
downstairs.

676
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,639
Don't just stand there,
help her down.

677
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,686
(mouthing)

678
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,527
We need you to run
to the pharmacy.

679
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,611
Now?

680
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,071
I'm out of medication.

681
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,906
Here's my prescription.

682
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,992
I should go open
some windows in the bedroom.

683
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,077
To air it out.

684
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,578
- (exhales)
- Oh, hurry.

685
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,163
Joyce is in agony.

686
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,462
Joyce is sick. I have
to go to the drugstore.

687
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,755
Well, how am I supposed
to get out of here?

688
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,090
I don't know.

689
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,259

- Hello?
- Karl, it's me. I need your help.

Speak up, I can hardly hear you.

693
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,610
I'm trapped in
Joyce Dubner's house.

694
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,030
Oh, dear, is she telling
her appendectomy story again?

695
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,782
She doesn't know I'm here,
and neither does Naomi.

696
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,285
Sorry, Naomi's there?

697
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,245

Yes, and I'm trapped upstairs.

(harsh whisper):
Now is not the time!

702
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,631
Oh, what a nasty tone.
I think I'm gonna hang up.

All right, all right,
fine, fine.

704

I'm having an affair.

705
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,802
Now can you please
come over here

706
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,887
and create a distraction
so I can get out?

707
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,891

00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,872
APRIL: Oh,
it went great.

877
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,748
Oh, good.

878
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,625
Mm, we should celebrate.

879
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,922
Oh, I can't. My friend is here.

880
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,924
- I don't see anybody.
- (chuckles)

881
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,510
She's in the bathroom.

882
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,556
(groaning)

883
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,558
What's wrong
with her?

884
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,228
I think she
has diarrhea.

885
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,522
Lot of that
going around.

886
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,277
- (chuckles)
- Come here.

887
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,237
Can we talk tomorrow?

888
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,239
I'm here now.

889
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,910
- Now is not a good time.
- Mm.

890
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,204
And I have something
important to tell you.

891
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,123
Don't tell him. Not now.

892
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,375
What is it?

893
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,712
- No. You're drunk.
- I had two beers.

894
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:50,799
- Come on, give me, give me a hint.
- (chuckles)

895
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,801
APRIL:
Well...

896
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:57,056
(sighs) I have been doing
a lot of thinking about us,

897
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,725
and I realized something.

898
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,935
Are you breaking up
with me?

899
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,811
God, no.

900
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,813
- ROB: (chuckles) Okay.
- (April chuckles)

901
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,358
I'm in love with you.

902
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,319
(exhales)

903
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,613
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- (groans)

904
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,616
I just... I just thought
it would be nice to know

905
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,284
how you felt
about me.

906
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,413
I'm not leaving my wife.

907
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,832
Yeah, no, I'm not asking you to.

908
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,084
See, I think you are.

909
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:31,465
I think you're too drunk
to have this conversation.

910
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:32,925
When you start using
the "L word,"

911
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,635
a guy can sober up pretty quick.

912
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,679
You don't love me?

913
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,138
I think you're great.

914
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,933
You think I'm great?

915
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,518
That's your response?

916
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,979
You knew the rules.
I was very clear.

917
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,481
I will never leave my wife!

918
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,692
- APRIL: Please don't yell at me.
- ROB: Well, you're making me angry!

919
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,777
(crying):
Okay, okay, okay.

920
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,113
I-I... (shuddering inhale)

921
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,032
(exhales)

922
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,495
So...

923
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,123
where does that leave me?

924
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,624
I don't know.

925
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,004
I think that
you should go.

926
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,867
You okay?

927
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,704
Yeah, he usually doesn't speak
to me that way.

928
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,707
He's normally very kind.

929
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,710
Oh, honey.

930
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,012
Well, I hope his wife
appreciates how lucky she is.

931
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,601
I'm not sure she's that lucky.

932
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:10,939
KARL:
So...

933
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,775
Tommy Harte.

934
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,027
I know he's a bit young...

935
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,155
A bit? When I met him,
he was eight.

936
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,948
And you were heterosexual.

937
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,035
And now this child
is your lover?

938
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,745
Who knew there was
such a fine line

939
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,747
between adultery
and day care?

940
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,208
Bugger off, Karl.
You have no right to judge me.

941
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,918
I'm not judging you,

942
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,419
I'm just teasing.

943
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,255
If anything,
I'm happy for us. Drink?

944
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,258
Brandy. What do you mean
you're happy for us?

945
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,596
Well, don't you see?
We don't need to get a divorce.

946
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,350
We have stumbled into
the perfect arrangement.

947
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,435
You will have your lovers
and I will have mine,

948
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,772
and then we will come home
to sparkling conversation.

949
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,649
It's very European.

950
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,985
It doesn't bother you that I'm
having sex with someone else?

951
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,946
Darling, I'm gay.

952
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,950
Look, for me, sex with a woman
is like emptying the dishwasher.

953
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,618
I mean, I'll do it if I'm asked,

954
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,912
but if someone else volunteers,
I won't complain.

955
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,961
Oh. You know I love this shirt.

956
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,505
You might've asked for vodka.

957
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,966
I don't understand.
How can you not be jealous?

958
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,428
Sorry, wait, you want me
to be jealous of Tommy Harte?

959
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,972
He's jealous of you!

960
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,932
So he should be.
I'm the husband.

961
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,684
Not for long.

962
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,811
Oh, what are you gonna do,
divorce me and marry Tommy?

963
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,980
- Maybe I will.
- Oh, good. Well, I'll get you a gift.

964
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,024
Where will you be registered?
Fisher-Price?

965
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,319
Everything is not a joke, Karl.

966
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,488
You're not being funny,
you're being cruel.

967
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,991
Oh, darling, I'm not trying
to be cruel. I love you.

968
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,160
No, you don't!

969
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,995
Not the way I need.

970
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,830
I want a man
who loves me so much

971
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,875
that he would kill another man
if I slept with someone else.

972
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,670
And I'm never gonna get that
from you, am I?

973
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,964
No.

974
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,804
But you're my best friend.

975
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,307
It's not enough.

976
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,895
(door closes)

977
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,482
(cell phone buzzes)

978
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,197
(whispers):
Shit.

979
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,369
Yeah? Hey, babe.

980
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,414
Hey. Why are you whispering?

981
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,667
Oh, I was just, I was writing,
so, you know... (coughs)

982
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,337
...takes me a minute to get out
of the "in my head" voice

983
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,714
and back into the
"out loud" voice.

984
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,592
- How did everything go?
- Oh, the conference was great,

985
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:47,596
and my sisters...
are my sisters. (laughs)

986
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,057
- Yeah.
- Look, if you're working, I don't want to stop you.

987
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,060
Um, is Jade up?
I can talk to her.

988
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,522
Uh...

989
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,024
I-I-I think she's
walking the dog.

990
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:05,072
It's a little late for that, no?

991
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,741
Yeah, but, you know...
(chuckles)

992
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,701
dog can't tell time, so...

993

(chuckles)

994
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,377
I'm, uh...
I'm glad you checked in.

995
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,130
Yeah. Um, I love you.

996
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,216
I love you, too.
