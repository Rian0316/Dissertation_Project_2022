1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,600
If Mary alice was having some sort of crisis,we'd have known.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,100
She lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,600
Gabby, the woman killed herlf.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,300
Something must have been going on.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,300
Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,400
I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,400
If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Why aren't you happy?

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,900
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,400
What's that?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,400
It's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,300
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
An odd thing happens when we die.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,300
Our senses vanish.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Taste, touch, smell, and sound become a distant memory,

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
but our sight --

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,800
ah, our sight expands,

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
and we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Of course, most of what's visible to the dead could also be seen by the living,

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,900
if they'd only take the time to look.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Like my friend Gabrielle.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I should have seen how unhappy she was, but I didn't.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I only saw her clothes from Paris...

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
and her platinum jewelry...

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,600
and her brand-new diamond watch.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Had I looked closer,

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
I'd have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,300
desperately in search of a life raft.

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Luckily for her, she found one.

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,800
Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,700
as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,700
But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,700
But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Damn it.

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,500
Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,600
Come on, come on!

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Where are the rest of my clothes?

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,800
I'll find them. Just get out.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,900
Where?

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
- Out the window.
- What?

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Go, go, go, go, go!

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Hi, honey. You're home early.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
My meeting got canceled.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Didn't you take a shower this morning?

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
I, uh, I just finished a workout.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Where's John?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
John?

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,200
Yeah. That's his truck out front.

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Gabrielle was panicked.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,300
She knew if her husband discovered her secret,

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
she would feel the full force of his wrath.

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Hey, mr. Solis.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,100
Hey, John, take care of that ficus yet?

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
- I'll get to it as soon as I'm done here.
- All right.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
- But she was quickly reminded that...
- Yeah, sure.

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
- what Carlos couldn't see...
- No problem.

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Couldn't hurt her.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Episode 2 - Ah, but underneath

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered,

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,800
first by my suicide...

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,300
and then by the discovery of...

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
a note among my belongings that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,300
My friends gathered to discuss its implications.

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,100
I think we should give it to Paul.

65
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
He's still mourning, Susan. He'll probably freak out.

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
It doesn't matter. She was his wife. He deserves to have all the facts.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Well, we could do it gently.

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,200
We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
That would be fun.

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
"Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
over some deep, dark secret. Another bear claw?"

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
We could always call the police.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.

75
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,500
No, this was serious. I know it was.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
We got to find out what was going on.

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Let's say we do. There's a chance we're not going to like what we find.

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Well, isn't it worse to be in the dark?

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,100
It's the age-old question, isn't it?

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,100
How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
My friends were right to be concerned.

83
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
They knew that every family has its secrets,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and as my son and husband could have told them,

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500
you need to think carefully before digging them up.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
After talking for hours,

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
my friends still hadn't agreed on what to do with the note.

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
So they decided to talk about it in the morning after a good night's rest.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But no one could sleep that night.

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
They each kept thinking of my suicide

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and how terribly alone I must have felt.

92
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,300
You see, loneliness was something my friends understood all too well.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
It's okay. I'm up.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Good.

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I have a question for you.

96
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,600
Do you remember when you proposed?

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,700
For god's sake --

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
We sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine,

99
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,500
and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said,

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,000
"if you marry me, Bree Mason,

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I promise to love you for the rest of my life."

102
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,200
And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant, and even though my father didn't like you,

103
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
I said yes.

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
That was a long time ago.

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,800
You're going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer,

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
and we're going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
- Bree --
- You promised.

108
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,900
All right.

109
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,900
Good. I'm going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk.

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,500
Would you like something to drink?

111
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Anything but apple wine.

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Susan awoke that night alone and parched,

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
but as she gazed out her window,

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quinch her thirst.

115
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,000
"dear diary, Mike doesn't even know I'm alive."

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,300
Shut up.

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,900
If you want to date him, you're going to have to ask him out.

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,300
I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
How's that going?

120
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,100
Shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?

121
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,400
I can't find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,100
The measuring cup?

123
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
Yeah.

124
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I -- well, it's -- it's got to be here somewhere. Just keep looking.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
I know you're awake.

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I know you're a jerk.

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,900
You know, Carlos, I didn't marry you so I could have dinner by myself six times a week.

129
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,600
You know how bored I was today?

130
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,900
I came this close to actually cleaning the house.

131
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,100
Don't be that way. I got you a gift.

132
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,600
Nope. No, no, no, no.

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You're not going to buy your way out of this one.

134
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,900
It's a good gift.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,900
Is that white gold?

136
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah. Put it on...

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and then make love to me.

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm not in the mood.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,100
But we could stay up and talk.

140
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,800
When a man buys a womaexpensive jewelry,

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
there are many things he may want in return for future reference,

142
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,300
conversation ain't one of them.

143
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
- Hey, that was a joke.
- Yeah, right.

144
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Let go of me.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Hey, you've been acting like a nightmare for a month. What's wrong?

146
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,900
I can't fix it unless you tell me.

147
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,800
It's not exciting anymore, Carlos.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So what am I supposed to do?

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't know.

150
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,600
Be the way you used to be.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Surprise me. Take my breath away.

152
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Okay.

153
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Hey, Susan.

154
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,700
What's wrong?

155
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,500
I didn't realize anybody was going to be out here. I just sort of rolled out of bed.

156
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm sure you look fine.

157
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, Bongo, stop.

158
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
Sorry, uh... he scares easy.

159
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,200
No, it-- it's fine.

160
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,600
I-I get it. I didn't mean to disturb you.

161
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,700
I'll see you later.

162
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Do you want to have dinner with me?

163
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Just the two of us?

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well... and Julie.

165
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood,

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. Sort of a tradition.

167
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,000
I thought you said you were a lousy cook.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Well, I order takeout.

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,300
Oh, you invite them over for home cooking and give them takeout.

170
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's sort of a new tradition.

171
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm working out the kinks.

172
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,400
I'll tell you what -- how about I cook and you guys come over to my place?

173
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,100
Great.

174
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Friday night at 6:00?

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll be there.

176
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
All right. Come on

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Bye, Bongo.

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,700
Julie!

179
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,000
Mike Delfino just invited us to dinner friday night.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
He did? Cool.

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,300
But only I'm going, because you're going to come down with something semi-serious

182
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
that requires bed rest and fluids.

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life.

184
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Of course, she was unaware of her mother's recent track record with fire.

185
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,200
It's all gone --

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
everything my ex-husband worked for all those years.

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
Gone.

188
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Well, don't worry about clothing.

189
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I already started a collection from people in the neighborhood.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
What? I don't want to wear other people's old crap.

191
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Edie, you can be homeless, or you can be ungracious. You really can't afford to be both.

192
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
That reminds me -- my insurance check still hasn't come yet.

193
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Can I stay with you for a few more weeks?

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Of course. What kind of christian would I be if I denied shelter to a friend in need?

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Oh, look, here's something we can salvage.

196
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,400
Your measuring cup.

197
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
We can just scrape off the burnt part, and it'll look good as new.

198
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
That's not my cup. Mine was plastic.

199
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,900
Well, how did it get in here?

200
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,900
I don't know. Who cares?

201
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Now, would you put that down and start looking for jewelry?

202
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Dr. Albert Goldfein was the most accomplished marriage counselor in the city.

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,600
He had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse

204
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
to infidelity

205
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,900
to domestic violence.

206
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Yes, dr. Goldfine thought he had seen it all,

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
and then he met the Van de Kamps.

208
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Hi. I'm Bree, and this is my husband Rex...

209
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
and I brought you some homemade potpourri.

210
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
The answer is yes.

211
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You're about to make a fortune off of us.

212
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Guys, I'm very --

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Sit in your seats.

214
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
I am not going to tell you again!

215
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Buckle up!

216
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,900
I mean it, so help me, I will --

217
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Crap!

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Licenses, registration, ma'am.

219
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?

220
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
I have a theory.

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
The kids are jumping up and down. They should be sitting, wearing their seat belts.

222
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I don't let them -- they don't even listen to me. It's very frustrating.

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Well, you have to find a way to control them. After all, that's your job.

224
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Though he'd been a policeman for six years,

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,100
officer Hayes had never found himself in a truly dangerous situation.

226
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Then again, he had never before told a woman how to raise her children.

227
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Are you saying I'm a bad mother?

228
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
Ma'am, you need to get back in your car, please.

229
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,900
I have no help. My husband's always away on business.

230
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm going to have to ask you to step back now.

231
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
My babysitter joined the witness relocation program.

232
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I haven't slept through the night in six years,

233
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
and for you to stand there and judge me...

234
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm not going to give you a ticket.

235
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm just going to let you off with a warning.

236
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I accept your apology.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Buckle up.

238
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,600
Mrs. Solis.

239
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Hello, Jonathan.

240
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Well, this is my room.

241
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,400
Sorry about the mess.

242
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Ah, don't worry about it.

243
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
You just missed my mom. Friday she coaches my little sister's soccer team.

244
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,500
Oh, yes. I heard that.

245
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Um, John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.

246
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,800
Mr. Solis isn't starting to catch on, is he?

247
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
No, no, he doesn't have a clue, god love him.

248
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,500
It's just that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden.

249
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Great. You're breaking up with me

250
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,300
in my own bedroom.

251
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,100
No, no, no. I'm not dumping you.

252
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,200
Lately you've been the only thing keeping me going.

253
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It's just we can't do it at my house anymore.

254
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,700
So, then, where do you want to do it?

255
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?

256
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,300
Mrs. Solis.

257
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Better hurry. We don't have a lot of time.

258
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
And so there's just the four of us.

259
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
My older son Andrew is 16, Danielle is 15, and --

260
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,100
I don't need to see pictures. Bree,

261
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,200
you've spent most of the hour engaging in small talk.

262
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Oh, have I?

263
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Yes. Rex has been very vocal about his issues.

264
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Don't you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?

265
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,800
Doc, um... this is the thing you got to know about Bree --

266
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
she doesn't like to talk about her feelings.

267
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
To be honest, it's hard to know if s has any.

268
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?

269
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,300
Who knows?

270
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,300
She's always pleasant,

271
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
and I can't tell you how annoying that is.

272
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Whatever she feels, it's so far below the surface, no one can see it.

273
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I feel like she's using all these...

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What?

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
Uh, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Would you like to respond to what Rex just said?

277
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Is there some truth there?

278
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?

279
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Of course not.

280
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,900
Ah. This is great.

281
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,200
I've got tons of homework tonight.

282
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,400
It's so easy to concentrate after sex.

283
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm glad I could help. Education is very important.

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh, I got something for you.

285
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I was going to give it to you next time I mowed your lawn,

286
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,700
but since you're here...

287
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, it's a rose.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,700
It's not just any rose.

289
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Look at all the petals. There's no floss. It's perfect.

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, John.

291
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Just like you.

292
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,800
The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.

293
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I spent days looking for just the right one. I finally found it.

294
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,400
For John, this was no longer a meaningless little affair.

295
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Gabrielle could now clearly see he was falling in love with her.

296
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,200
It's just beautiful.

297
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,200
I...

298
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
I got to go.

299
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
Goodbye.

300
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
So what are we having?

301
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,600
Uh, well, I talked to Julie, and -- thanks. And she suggested rib eye steaks.

302
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
She said that's your favorite.

303
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Oh, yeah, I love my steak.

304
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Hi, Mike. Susan.

305
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,900
Hey, I'm sorry about your house. How you holding up?

306
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,900
All right, I guess.

307
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,900
Oh, is somebody having a party?

308
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
No, Susan's just throwing me one of her traditional welcome-to-the-neighborhood dinners,

309
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
only I'm cooking...

310
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,900
and having it at my house.

311
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Ha ha. Traditional, huh? I didn't get one.

312
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,800
Oh, it's sort of a new tradition.

313
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Well, it won't be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.

314
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
That sounds so good.

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Susan suddenly had an awful feeling in the pit of her stoma...

316
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I've been having nothing but fast food lately.

317
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.

318
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,600
She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.

319
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,100
Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?

320
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,200
Oh, that's so sweet.

321
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,200
No, I don't want to intrude. Three's a crowd.

322
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
No, it's not like that. I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.

323
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, it's not like that.

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,300
The more, the merrier.

325
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
- Well, this will be fun.
- All right.

326
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
- Tomorrow night.We'll eat at 6:00.
- Great.

327
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, and, Susan...
- Yeah.

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,100
This will make up for the dinner that you never threw me.

329
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Right. Ha ha.

330
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
Should I have told her we were having steak?

331
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,100
She's not, like, a vegetarian or something, is she?

332
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh, no, no.

333
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
No, edie's definitely a carnivore.

334
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,200
Here's, um...

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Here's what I pulled for Edie.

336
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I should warn you that most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish.

337
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,700
Oh, don't worry about it. Edie's a beggar now,

338
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
which means she can'be a chooser.

339
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Of course, we don't have to add salt to the wound.

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,500
Listen, I was just getting dinner ready.

341
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,600
Say no more.

342
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,300
- I'll get out of your hair.
- No, no.

343
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,300
By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled over by a policeman?

344
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,

345
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
and I couldn't get them to sit down.

346
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,400
Young boys can be so willful.

347
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
I try everything.

348
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I scream, I threaten, I reason, I beg. Nothing works.

349
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,700
I don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand,

350
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,700
or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,500
My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,

352
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,200
so one time when I was acting up, she stopped

353
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,200
and left me on the side of the road, and she drove off.

354
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,800
You're kidding.

355
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Oh, she came back immediately,

356
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,100
but I never misbehaved in the car again.

357
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,600
You should try that.

358
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,400
Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids by the side of the road.

359
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
When it comes to discipline, sometimes you must be creative.

360
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,100
My mother knew that. Smart lady.

361
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
Of course, she's in a home now,

362
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
and her mind has just turned to mush.

363
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.

364
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Oh, right, right.

365
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

366
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,200
Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?

367
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
She has nothing to wear.

368
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,700
I thought that was the look she was going for.

369
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,800
Oh, Susan.

370
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Edie may be trash, but she's still a human being.

371
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,100
Zach? Is your dad home?

372
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,100
I need to talk to him.

373
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.

374
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Hope I'm not interrupting.

375
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.

376
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just wanted to come by and say hello, you know,

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,500
see how you guys a doing.

378
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,200
We're trying to move on. It's been pretty tough.

379
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Yeah, I could only imagine.

380
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,100
I mean, not knowing why Mary Alice...

381
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,800
Why what?

382
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Why she did it. Oh, here, let me help you.

383
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I've got it, I've got it.

384
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm sorry if I upset you.

385
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,400
Can I be frank?

386
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,700
Of course.

387
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't care what her reasons were.

388
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.

389
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
It doesn't matter.

390
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
She abandoned her husband and her son, and I'll never forgive her.

391
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,100
As I watched Ssusan, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her.

392
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,100
She wanted so much to know why I did it...

393
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Why I killed myself.

394
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
It's not enough to want the truth.

395
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
You must know where to look for it.

396
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,300
And the truth is elusive, because it knows where to hide.

397
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,100
Hello, Julie.

398
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,000
I talked to your mom about donating some clothes for Edie.

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,900
She's at mrs. Van de Kamp's,

400
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,900
but I'll see if she left some stuff upstairs.

401
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I-I was, um, just admiring your new measuring cup.

402
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
Yeah, we lost ours.

403
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,100
Really?

404
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,300
So I couldn't find the clothes. I'm sorry.

405
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,600
That's okay.

406
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,200
If you want me to keep looking...

407
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
No, you've done more than enough, truly.

408
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Bree, Rex just called. He won't be able to meet you here today.

409
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Apparently, there was an emergency at the hospital.

410
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Oh. Well, I wish he had called me.

411
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,700
He suggested perhaps you'd like to meet with me by yourself.

412
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
You've been very quiet in our joint sessions.

413
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,100
What?

414
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Oh -- oh, no, thank you. I-I have some things that I-I need to do today.

415
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,900
You -- you sure?

416
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,900
Uh, yeah. I'm sure.

417
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.

418
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,500
What's that?

419
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Take off your coat.

420
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So now you're taking Julie on the dinner date with Mike?

421
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Yeah, well, if Edie's going to be there, I'm going to need emotional support.

422
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I can't believe she wormed her way in.

423
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
- How did you let her do that?
- I don't know.

424
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
I was going to take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast.

425
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,600
Well, you know what you need to do.

426
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
You need to get there early, spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.

427
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
That's a good idea.

428
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,100
Edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30,

429
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
so I should shoot for 5:00.

430
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
That a girl.

431
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
I'm just going to take these upstairs.

432
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm going to keep my one little bag and go home.

433
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,700
That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?

434
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Oh, John gave it to me.

435
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
John? Your gardener? He gave you a rose?

436
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,500
Yes.

437
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I am having some new bushes planted outside,

438
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,600
and he gave me that as a color palette.

439
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Sure is beautiful, isn't it?

440
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,100
Yes, it is.

441
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,200
I'm sure Freud would not approve of this.

442
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, who cares what he thinks?

443
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I took psychology in college. We learned all about Freud.

444
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,000
A miserable human being.

445
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
What makes you say that?

446
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,500
Well, think about it --

447
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
he grew up in the late 1800s. There were no appliances back then.

448
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
His mother had to do everything by hand,

449
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown,

450
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,100
not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family.

451
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,900
And what does he do?

452
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,800
He grows up and becomes famous peddling a theory

453
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
that the problems of most adults

454
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,200
can be traced back to something awful their mother has done.

455
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,100
She must have felt so betrayed.

456
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,400
He saw how hard she worked.

457
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,200
He saw what she did for him.

458
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Did he even ever think to say "thank you"?

459
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I doubt it.

460
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,800
There you go.

461
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Just so you know, many of Freud's theories have been discredited.

462
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,800
Good.

463
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Boys, I am not going to tell you again -- sit. I mean it.

464
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,900
I am serious.

465
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,900
You boys are going to be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats.

466
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,300
For the first time, Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children.

467
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
She was being challenged.

468
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
So she decided it was time to get creative.

469
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Out. Can't behave, you heard me, you cannot ride.

470
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,700
You, out.

471
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,900
- Where's mom going?
- I don't know.

472
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,500
Mommy's a genius.

473
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,600
5, 6 -- alright.

474
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,900
I will be right back.

475
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,900
Boys?

476
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
If you're hiding, you've got to stop now, 'cause mommy doesn't think it's funny!

477
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,700
Oh, excuse me.

478
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,800
I'm sorry. I'm looking for my boys. Three boys with red hair.

479
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
- Have you seen them?
- Yeah. I also saw you drive away and leave them.

480
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,300
I know. I was just trying to scare them into behaving.

481
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Did you see where they went?

482
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're in my kitchen.

483
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Listen, uh, it seems to me that you have some anger management issues.

484
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,400
I have four kids under the age of 6. I absolutely have anger management issues.

485
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,100
Yeah, well, I think you need to talk to somebody,

486
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
because abandoning your children is --

487
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,900
Hey, I-I didn't abandon them. I came back.

488
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm just saying it's not normal.

489
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Well, my kids aren't normal,

490
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
and now I don't have time for this, lady, so --

491
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,500
boys, get out here!

492
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,500
No, I don't think they should go anywhere until you calm down.

493
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,200
- Get in the car.
- She's got cookies.

494
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,500
Well, bring them. We're leaving.

495
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,800
- Oh, no, no. Stay put.
- I don't think so. Aah!

496
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,300
- Listen, lady, you and I are going to have a little talk.
- Leave my mommy alone!

497
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
Let go of me!

498
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
What's the matter with you?

499
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Run, boys, run!

500
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
Son of a -- aah!

501
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
You get back here!

502
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Boys, you're going to need to put on your --

503
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,400
You come back here right now! Get back or I'm going to call social services!

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,900
Oh, my god.

505
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,600
Carlos, what have you done?

506
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,100
I saw it when I drove by the dealership.

507
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I thought, "Gabrielle would look so beautiful in this."

508
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Cost me an arm and a leg.

509
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
It's got GPS navigation, 200-watt stereo system, rear parking --

510
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,500
Oh, my god, it's beautiful.

511
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,200
So... did I take your breath away?

512
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Absolutely.

513
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Is it the best gift you've ever gotten?

514
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos,

515
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
so she responded the only way she knew how.

516
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,900
She had a feeling the truth would have been lost on her husband anyway.

517
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,900
After all,

518
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,900
it's the rare man who understands the value of a single perfect rose.

519
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Oh, I hope you don't mind. I thought I'd come by early and help you set up.

520
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Hey, Susan.

521
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Don't worry. Mike and I have got everything under control.

522
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,200
Bongo.

523
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,100
I don't know why he barks at you.

524
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,000
Well, I wouldn't take it personally. Dogs are very sensitive.

525
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,700
What's up, Bongo, huh?

526
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,500
You never know what freaks them out, huh?

527
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,500
In the distance, susan thought she heard a bell ring.

528
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Ooh, is it a strange noise, huh? What is it? A weird smell?

529
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Round one had started.

530
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,000
Look, all I'm saying is that this whole

531
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
"it takes two to mess up a marriage" theory is bull.

532
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
The problems that weave are because of her.

533
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,300
That is not true, Rex.

534
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,300
All right, fine. What have I been doing for the past 20 years that's been so awful?

535
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
You're not saying anything because I've been a great husband,

536
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,100
and it kills you to admit that.

537
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,400
Rex, I'm curious --

538
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,400
do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with Bree?

539
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Huh?

540
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,900
By your own admission, your home is always clean,

541
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
your clothes are always freshly pressed. Sounds like a wonderful cook.

542
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Despite her flaws, do you ever remember to say "thank you"?

543
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,000
"Thank you"?

544
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,600
Yes.

545
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,300
Bongo! Bongo.Get down. Down.

546
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,900
Go on. Unh-unh. Down.

547
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,300
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,200
So, um, who's the guy that lives across from mrs. Huber again?

549
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Mm. That's mr. Mullen,

550
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
and just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets.

551
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,900
That's okay. I love animals.

552
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,900
He's a taxidermist.

553
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Thanks for the warning.

554
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,300
Isn't mr. Mullen's brother your divorce attorney?

555
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,000
Uh, yes. Yes, he was.

556
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Can I say something?

557
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
In my heart, I still believe that you and Carl are going to get back together.

558
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Really?

559
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Oh, yeah, I-I've never seen two people more in love.

560
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,900
I mean, she's never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man. Never.

561
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,100
It was everything susan could do to keep a smile on her face.

562
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Round two was under way, and she was already taking a beating.

563
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,900
- You know what, mrs. Britt?
- What edie hadn't counted on...

564
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,900
- Do you know who I always liked?
- Was Susan had someone else in her corner.

565
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Mr. Authwell -- your fourth husband.

566
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Oh, he was my second husband. I've only been married twice.

567
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Twice?

568
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
You weren't married to the guy with all the tattoos that they took away in handcuffs?

569
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,700
No, Julie, she wasn't married to Javier.

570
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,800
That was just one of her special friends.

571
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,300
I think we should change the subject. You know, unless you want to keep talking about it.

572
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,100
Bongo, get down.

573
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,600
Wait, wait. Let -- let me show you something. Bongo.

574
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
He loves that gravy.

575
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
While you were in there tossing the salad,

576
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,100
I taught him something.

577
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Up.

578
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Susan was furious with Edie for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner.

579
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,400
She was also furious with Mike for not seeing through this blatant maneuver.

580
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
But mostly...

581
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,700
you know what? I'm going to go get the desserts.

582
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
She was furious with herself for not having thought of it first.

583
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I can barely get him to sit.

584
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You are a good dog. You're the best dog ever. Yes, you are.

585
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,300
Ha ha. I've never seen him walk on two legs.

586
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Well, he knows who to come to, doesn't he? He knows who to come to.

587
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Here's your dessert.

588
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Thank you. Mmm. My, this looks yummy.

589
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,900
Oh, look at that.

590
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,000
Looks like Bongo's finally warming up to Susan.

591
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Yeah, we just got off on the wrong foot. We're best buddies now.

592
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Oh, what a good boy.

593
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,800
Bongo, are you okay?

594
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
What's wrong with him?

595
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
I don't know. I've never heard him make that sound.

596
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
Hey, you okay, pal?

597
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,400
Mom.

598
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Hey, you all right? You okay? Come on.

599
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,200
Call the vet. The number's on the fridge. Tell him I'll be right there.

600
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay, don't you worry about a thing. I'll stay here and get everything cleaned up.

601
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Thanks, Edie.

602
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Is there anything I can do?

603
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
No.

604
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

605
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
How's Bongo doing?

606
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,700
I'm, uh, just waiting to see if they'll have to operate.

607
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Oh, god.

608
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,800
I-I... I stopped and I got this...

609
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,800
I am just so sorry for this.

610
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm really sorry I snapped at you. I was ju so --

611
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,100
Oh, no, it's okay.

612
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,800
Good news.

613
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,300
We won't have to do surgery.

614
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,600
Oh, that's great.

615
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,300
We've given Bongo something to help pass the earring.

616
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,300
When he does, would you like us to retrieve it for you?

617
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm going to say no.

618
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Okay. You should be able to take him home in about an hour.

619
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,200
You must be so relieved.

620
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,400
I'm sorry. I was just really worried.

621
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,700
Well, it was your dog. I get it.

622
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Actually, he was my wife's dog, and, uh...

623
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,500
one of the last things she said to me in the hospital before she died

624
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
was to be sure I looked after him,

625
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,300
and, um, I promised her I would.

626
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,300
And just like that,Susan could suddenly see something she'd never seen before.

627
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,600
He, uh, meant so much to her.

628
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.

629
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,300
And if, uh, something had happened, I would have felt like I had failed her.

630
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,200
I know that sounds stupid, but I...

631
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,200
and she knew right then neither she nor Edie would be laying claim to his heart anytime soon.

632
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,700
No, it doesn't. Not at all.

633
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,700
So she decided, for now,

634
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,500
she could settle for just being his friend.

635
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,000
This is for you. Well, for Bongo.

636
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
You give it to him.

637
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Yes. As I look back at the world I left behind,

638
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,400
it's all so clear to me:

639
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
the beauty that waits to be unveiled,

640
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,700
the mysteries that long to be uncovered.

641
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
But people so rarely stop to take a look,

642
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,700
they just keep moving.

643
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
It's a shame really,

644
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
there's so much to see.
