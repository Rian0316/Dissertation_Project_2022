00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,430
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
REBEKAH: Previously on
The Originals...

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,596
这座城市曾经是我的家
我要夺回来
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,231
喝了吧，只有这样我才能让你看到
你应该看到的真相
Drink. It's the only way
I can show you what you need to see.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,502
克劳斯只真正
REBEKAH: There's only
ever been one man

5
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,372
害怕过一个人
我的父亲麦可
Klaus has truly feared.
my father, Mikael.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,309
- 我们要你找到麦可
- 没问题
-We'd like you to find Mikael.
-Of course.

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,939
你必须要看到
现在你可以复仇了
You needed to see it.
And now you can take your revenge.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,717
走吧，尽快逃走吧，越远越好
Go. Run as far
and as fast as you can.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,690
恐怕你是被困住了
I'm afraid you're trapped.

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,124
边界咒语
真祖可以进却不能出
Boundary spell. The Originals can enter
but they can't leave.

11
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,757
蕾贝卡！
珍惜你仅剩的几口气吧
Rebekah!
Cherish the breath in your lungs!

12
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,665
这是你最后的机会了
It'll be your last.

13
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,454
没事的，这只是暴风雨而已
Hush now.
It's just a storm.

14
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,727
别害怕，我不会让它伤害你的
Don't be afraid.
I won't let it hurt you.

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,196
尼克，别走
Nik, don't go.

16
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,236
这是我为父亲刻的
I carved it for Father.

17
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,609
是一个勇敢的骑士
It's a brave knight.

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,147
现在你也能变得勇敢了
Now you can be brave too.

19
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,220
你会陪着我直到暴风雨过去吗？
Will you stay with me
until the storm ends?

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,298
我会永远在你身边，蕾贝卡
无论发生什么事
I will always stay with you,
Rebekah, no matter what.

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,007
蕾贝卡！
KLAUS: Rebekah!

22
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,308
- 快走
- 不准走
-Walk away.
-Don't move!

23
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,681
- 赶紧走吧
- 我做不到，我们被困在这里了
-Leave us now.
-I can't. We're stuck here.

24
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,682
以利亚，白橡树木桩在他手上
Elijah, he has the white oak stake.

25
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,755
这是我特地为你准备的，妹妹
I brought it for you, sister.

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,879
离开他的视线
ELlJAH: Get out of his sight.

27
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,582
你待在这里只会激怒他
Your presence here
only serves to anger him.

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,822
让我来对付他
Leave him to me now.

29
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,093
我以兄弟的身份请求你
Now, I'm asking you
brother to brother.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,171
结束这场闹剧吧
We end this nonsense now.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,866
你要站在叛徒那一边吗？
You would side with that traitor?

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,999
我没有选边站
I am not choosing sides

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,443
但我绝对不允许你伤害我们的妹妹
but I will not allow you
to hurt our sister.

34
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,247
反正我们也走不出这个墓地，以利亚
We cannot leave this cemetery,
Elijah.

35
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,386
你觉得你还能保护她多久？
How long do you think
you can defend her?

36
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,953
只要我还活着
As long as it takes.

37
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,862
我就会用尽任何手段保护她
And by whatever means necessary.

38
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,700
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：再会纽奥良

39
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,807
无论如何，一定要让自己活着
主演：约瑟夫摩根
MARCEL: Do whatever it takes.
Just stay alive.

40
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,467
我保证我一定会救你出去的
I promise you,
I'll get you out of there.

41
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,203
我从没见过他这个样子
I've never seen him
like this before.

42
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,314
他已经完全被愤怒冲昏了头
He's out of his mind with rage,
up all night

43
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,643
一整晚都在吼着各种难听的话语
howling one obscenity-laced
tirade after the next.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,213
他会杀了我的
He's gonna kill me.

45
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,150
好吧，那你尽量离他远点
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
All right. Stay as far away from him
as you can.

46
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,381
这主意真不错
Well, that's a brilliant strategy

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,013
但那个死贱人莎莉丝特
but given that that dead bitch, Celeste,

48
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,023
把我们困在这里，直到下次月亮升起
主演：克莱儿荷特
has trapped us in here
until moonrise,

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,454
这可能不太容易做到
my options are somewhat limited.

50
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,028
我不会把你丢在里面不管的
主演：菲比托金
I'm not leaving you in there.

51
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,155
黛维娜会找出咒语的漏洞
主演：菲比托金
Davina will find a loophole,
get you out early.

52
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,163
提前救你出来
然后我们就能一起离开这里
Then we can all go together.

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,364
如果克劳斯追来，我们就给他好看
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
If Klaus comes after us,
we will take him
on one hell of a ride.

54
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,527
这几个世纪来
I lived for centuries
looking over my shoulder,

55
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:29,638
我一直提心吊胆，时刻都在准备逃跑
主演：莉雅派普斯
ready to run at a moment's notice.

56
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,670
我又要回到那种生活了吗？
Am I to go back to that?

57
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,141
晚点再担心这个吧
再给我一点时间
Worry about that later.
Right now, just buy me some time.

58
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,405
我保证，我会救你出来的
I promise you,
I'll get you out of there.

59
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,682
嘿，小黛，感觉怎么样？
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
Hey, D, how you feeling?

60
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,651
我给你带了点东西
Got you some stuff.

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,250
有机香皂和香氛蜡烛
还有一些薰香
Organic soap and scented candles,
some incense.

62
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,195
希望这些能帮你尽快找回
原来的自己
Just trying to help you get back
to feeling, you know, yourself.

63
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,337
我听说，女巫们正在庆祝
Word on the street is,
the witches are celebrating.

64
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,971
收获祭中献祭的四个女孩
已经有三个复活了
Three out of the 4 girls sacrificed
in the Harvest have come back.

65
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,105
第一个是你的朋友莫妮克
然后是另一个女孩，现在是你
First, it was your friend Monique
and then another girl, now you.

66
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,609
我听说，另外两个女孩说
制片：兰斯安德森
What I hear, the others are saying

67
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,641
在她们死去的时候
that the ancestors were with them

68
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:18,621
祖先们一直陪伴着她们
与她们交谈，教导她们
while they were dead, you know,
talking to them, teaching them.

69
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,454
她们说自己变得比以前更强大
They say they're stronger than ever.

70
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,453
你也是这样吗？
Was it like that for you?

71
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,597
制片：邦妮怀斯

72
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,067
不是的，那里什么都没有
No. There was nothing.

73
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:35,641
只有无尽的寒冷、空虚和黑暗
It was cold, empty, and dark
and it went on forever.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,872
我很抱歉，小黛
编剧：麦克纳度奇
-I'm sorry, D.

75
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,176
我不想谈这些
编剧：麦克纳度奇
-I don't want to talk about it.

76
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,652
求求你，马赛尔
导演：杰西瓦恩
Please, Marcel, 

77
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,415
别逼我
don't make me.

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,155
你已经这样好几个小时了
有什么意义呢？
ELlJAH: You've been at this
for hours, to what end?

79
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,991
尼克劳斯，我跟你从小打到大
我了解你
Niklaus, I know you
and I grew up fighting you.

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,395
我不会被打倒，也不会被说服
I can't be beaten
nor can I be persuaded.

81
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,790
你过不了我这关的
You cannot get past me.

82
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,232
我可以的
KLAUS; I could get past you

83
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,668
只是可能要踏着你的尸体过去
although it might have to be
over your dead body.

84
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,199
你用那把刀桶了我
You did stab me with that blade,

85
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,675
让我承受了数小时无以名状的疼痛
forcing me to endure hours
of unspeakable pain.

86
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,939
或许我该把愤怒转移到你身上
Perhaps I should direct my rage
toward you.

87
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,846
你真该看看你自己
You should see yourself.

88
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,045
充满杀意的神情，自以为是的姿态
The murderous expression,
the self-righteous posturing.

89
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,047
你就跟父亲一样
You look like Father.

90
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,127
我不是他
I'm not him.

91
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,198
我的愤怒源自蕾贝卡的背叛
Rebekah's betrayal
justifies my anger.

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,891
而他只是全然的疯狂
His was that of a madman.

93
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,264
你从没受到过他残忍的对待
You were never the recipient
of his cruelty!

94
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,770
你们两个没有，柯尔没有，芬恩也没有
你们都没有
None of you were,
not Kol, not Finn, none of you!

95
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,541
我想你可能已经忘记他真正的样子了
I think you've forgotten
what he was truly like.

96
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,237
不
No.

97
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,374
我没有忘记
I have not forgotten.

98
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,654
稳住
深呼吸
Be still.
Deep breath.

99
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,248
准备好
就是现在
Hold.
Now.

100
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,228
你的瞄准有进步
下次就能射中了
Your aim is improving.
Next time.

101
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,824
你居然还鼓励他，以利亚
MAN: You encourage him,
Elijah,

102
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,301
但他一天比一天更差劲
but he grows more pathetic
every day.

103
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,464
- 我才不差劲
- 不许顶嘴
-I'm not pathetic.
-Do not talk back to me.

104
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,270
你也没资格拿着这件武器
You're not man enough
to hold this weapon.

105
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,003
如果你不会打猎
你就毫无用处，只是个累赘
If you can't hunt,
you're nothing but a burden.

106
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,170
对不起
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,579
很遗喊泪眼汪汪的道歉填不饱肚子
It's a shame we can't feed
on sad-eyed apologies.

108
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,617
你就只会这点小伎俩
-It's your one and only skill.
-(CRlES OUT)

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,245
- 父亲，住手
- 退后，不然下一个就是你
-Father, stop.
-Stay back! Or you'll be next!

110
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,654
这孩子需要鞭策才能变强
The boy needs to be made strong.

111
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,839
尼克劳斯，我理解你的愤怒
Niklaus, I understand your anger

112
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,812
但我恳求你，做个比他更好的人
but I implore you,
be better than him.

113
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,210
做他做不了的事情
Do what he could not.

114
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,721
展现你的慈悲宽宏，而不是这残酷暴行
Demonstrate the grace of mercy
rather than this petty cruelty.

115
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,619
你要我对冤枉我的人展现慈悲
You ask me to show mercy
to one who has wronged me.

116
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,860
你真是一点都不了解我，是吧，哥哥？
You really don't know me at all,
do you, brother?

117
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,761
够了
Enough.

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,527
不论我做错了什么
Whatever I have done wrong,

119
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,637
我的罪过与你的相比简直微不足道
my guilt is nothing
compared to yours.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,036
你想要复仇？好啊
You want revenge?
Fine.

121
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,575
但在那之前
我要看着你的眼睛告诉你
But before you have it,
I will look you in the eye

122
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,234
为什么是你的残忍与怨恨
and tell you
why it was your cruelty

123
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,213
让我们变成现在这样
and your spite
that led us to this.

124
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,542
那你请说吧
Well, go on, then.

125
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,018
畅所欲言吧
Speak your piece,

126
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,144
等你讲完了
and when you are finished,

127
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,588
我会赐予你应得的惩罚
I will grant you
the punishment you deserve...

128
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,190
就算我要先解决以利亚也无所谓
...even if I have to go
through Elijah to do so.

129
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,091
（乌苏林修女会）

130
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,993
（教堂 肃静区）

131
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,505
黛维娜
Davina?

132
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,846
马赛尔跟我说你在这里
Marcel told me you were up here.

133
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,117
你想跟我说说到底发生了什么事吗？
Do you wanna tell me what happened?

134
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,860
我死了
I died.

135
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,631
最开始，只有我一个人
但后来我听到了他们的声音
And at first, I was alone
but then I heard them.

136
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,734
在我耳边低语
Voices whispering to me.

137
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,603
谁？
Who?

138
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,438
祖先们
The ancestors.

139
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,309
他们对我很生气
They're so angry with me.

140
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,474
我用我的力量对付自己的族人
I used my power against my own

141
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:43,021
他们说如果我再滥用我的魔法
and they said
they'd do horrible things to me

142
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,884
他们会严厉地惩罚我
if I misuse my magic again.

143
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,957
一个世纪前，你背叛了克劳斯
So, a century ago,
you betrayed Klaus,

144
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,326
那个史上最危险的吸血鬼
the most dangerous vampire
in history

145
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,591
而唯一能救你的人
and the only one that can save you

146
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,032
就是你关在我阁楼里的那个女孩
is the girl
that you had locked up in my attic

147
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,103
但她现在就是个废人
but she's a basket case.

148
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,172
所以实际上，你唯一的希望
就是我的侄女
So, really, your only hope
is my niece,

149
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,174
能在精神上使这个年轻女巫复原
psychoanalyst
to resurrected teen witches.

150
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,641
差不多就是这个情况吧？
Does that about sum it up?

151
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,406
你都被女巫下了咒了还这么嚣张
Well, you're pretty smug
for a guy with a witch's hex.

152
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,143
黛维娜的魔法是你唯一的希望
Davina's magic
is your only shot at a cure.

153
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,187
我们别在这么明显的问题上绕圈子了
Let's not dance around the obvious.

154
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,586
这个诅咒会害死我的
This hex is going to be
the end of me.

155
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,783
每个咒语都有漏洞
Every spell has a loophole.

156
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,088
你比起任何人都该更有信心
And you, of all people,
should have more faith.

157
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,695
西恩死的时候我就已经失去信心了
I lost my faith when Sean died.

158
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,929
当我回到纽奥良时
When I came back to New Orleans,

159
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,801
我只希望能够阻止
I had nothing but hope
of preventing a war

160
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,806
吸血鬼和女巫之间的战争
between the vampires
and the witches

161
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,934
现在女巫失控了
and now the witches
are out of control

162
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,539
而你还让一个吸血鬼真祖控制了法语区
and you allowed an Original vampire
to take control of the Quarter.

163
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,209
不，没有希望了
No. There is no hope.

164
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,811
你没希望了，这个城市也没希望了
当然我也没希望了
Not for you, not for the city
and certainly not for me.

165
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,946
我们找回了黛维娜
We get Davina back,

166
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,854
她会找到方法打败克劳斯
she will find a way
to take down Klaus.

167
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,791
不，他马上就要从那陷阱里出来了
No. He's going to get out
of this trap that he's in

168
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,329
到那时，他会找到你
and when he does,
he's going to find you

169
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,729
然后把你撕成碎片
and he is going to tear you
into pieces.

170
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,064
你这是咎由自取的，马赛尔
You reap what you sow, Marcel.

171
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,300
开始吧
KLAUS: Let it begin!

172
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,639
对蕾贝卡米卡森的审判
The trial of Rebekah Mikaelson.

173
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,643
真让人松一口气，他控制了自己的自负
What a relief.
His ego is in check.

174
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,578
尽管说出真相吧
Just speak your truth.

175
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,514
我会确保他守规矩的
I'll make certain
he behaves himself.

176
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,520
你被控背叛自己的家人
You stand accused of betraying
your own blood.

177
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,918
你如何办解？
How do you plead?

178
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,321
我恳请你闭嘴安静地听
I plead you to shut up and listen.

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,020
你召唤了我们的父亲
你把他带来了我们的家园
You summoned our father.
You brought him to our home.

180
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,925
你还能有什么辩解？
What possible defense
could you have?

181
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,861
我知道他是你唯一害怕的人
I knew he was the only thing
that you feared

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,433
我想让你离开
and I wanted you to run.

183
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,728
因为你恨我
Because you hated me.

184
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,770
因为你可恨
你剥夺了我爱的自由
Because you were hateful.
You denied me the freedom to love.

185
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,702
这就是你的辩解吗？
Oh, so that's your defense?

186
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,734
你召来了麦可，那个毁灭者
吸血鬼猎人
You called Mikael, the destroyer,
the hunter of vampires

187
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,178
就因为我阻止你
奔向那些愚蠢的追求者
because I detained you
from pursuing some dull suitors.

188
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,843
你很残忍
控制欲强，还爱操纵人
You were cruel,
and controlling and manipulative.

189
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:59,117
我是想保护你
远离那些蠢货和寄生虫
I was trying to protect you
from imbeciles and leeches,

190
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,385
况且你的判断力这么差
not to mention
your own poor judgment.

191
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,087
那那个你所珍视甚至称作朋友的人呢？
And what about the one that you
loved enough to call friend?

192
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,225
你为什么阻止我爱马赛尔？
Why did you forbid me
to love Marcel?

193
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,028
不要提他的名字
Do not mention his name.

194
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,637
你到底怎么了？
What has happened to you?

195
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,231
我还记得那个时常逗我笑
I remember the sweet boy

196
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,537
送我礼物的温柔男孩
who made me laugh
and gave me gifts.

197
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,878
他热爱艺术和音乐
Who loved art and music.

198
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,745
我曾想要成为像你一样的人
I wanted to be just like you.

199
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,652
你怎会堕落到如此地步？
How could you have fallen so far?

200
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,795
你说你鄙视蕾贝卡的背叛
You say you despise Rebekah
for her betrayal

201
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:43,231
但没人比她支持你的时间更长了
and yet, no one has stood
by your side for so long,

202
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,836
连我都比不上
not even I myself.

203
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,631
也许是你忘记了
Perhaps it's you that's forgotten.

204
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,074
我还记得那天父亲发现你
I remember the day
that Father caught you

205
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,667
在用他的猎刀做棋子
whittling little chess pieces
with his hunting knife.

206
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,512
他狠狠地毒打了你一顿
He beat you so mercilessly
and for so long,

207
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,414
我都怕你撑不下去了
I actually feared for your life.

208
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,412
父亲，父亲，求求你
退后
-Father. Father, please.
-Stay back!

209
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,458
- 不要
- 住手，快住手
No! Stop it! Stop it!

210
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,460
我不会再让你伤害他了
I will not let you hurt him anymore.

211
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:19,333
你为了他跟我作对
You stand against me for him?

212
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:37,118
你把她描绘成一个忠诚的妹妹
So you would paint her
as a loyal sister

213
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,556
但她却为了跟马赛尔在一起而背叛我
but she betrayed me
out of lust for Marcel.

214
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,127
或许这就是为什么你护着她
Perhaps that was why you did it.

215
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,161
因为爱
For love.

216
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,822
或许我能平息愤怒
Perhaps I might temper my rage

217
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,492
只要蕾贝卡承认
她也是她愚蠢行为的受害者
if Rebekah will admit
she was a victim of her own idiocy,

218
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,298
承认她深爱的马赛尔利用她
that her great love Marcel used her

219
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,670
赶走了我们，夺走了我的城市
to oust this family
and to take my city!

220
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,334
马赛尔没有利用我
Marcel did not manipulate me.

221
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,439
你虽为他说话，但也难免疑惑
You defend him
and yet you can't help but wonder,

222
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,381
说不定我说的是对的
what if I'm right?

223
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,613
我们彼此相爱
We loved each other.

224
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,223
是你再三阻挠招致了你的毁灭
It was your refusal to respect that
that led to your ruin.

225
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,089
那在你离开纽奥良后
他怎么没来找你？
Then why didn't he chase after you
when you fled New Orleans?

226
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,187
是啊，我就说嘛
他在这里忙着窃取我的成果呢
Oh, yes. That's right.
He was here stealing what I built.

227
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:25,167
你想让我放弃马赛尔
请求你的原谅？
Do you want me to renounce Marcel,
to beg for your forgiveness?

228
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,841
休想
马赛尔没做错
I won't.
Marcel is not at fault.

229
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,570
- 是我召来麦可的
- 蕾贝卡，你必须…
-I called Mikael.
-Rebekah, you must--

230
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,043
是我把他引到纽奥良
I was the one
who brought him to New Orleans

231
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,773
都是因为你的恶毒
because of your wickedness!

232
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,249
我渴望爱和幸福
I wanted love and happiness

233
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,581
但两样你都不让我得到
and you denied me the freedom
to have either.

234
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:47,124
是的，我对父亲既恨又怕
Yes. I hated
and I was afraid of our father

235
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,851
但他没你那么可恶
but he was a lesser evil than you.

236
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,993
我的私生子哥哥对我步步紧逼
My bastard brother
who loomed over me,

237
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,462
就像你现在一样威胁着我
threatening me as you are now.

238
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,633
我要摆脱你
I wanted rid of you

239
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,138
如果再给我一次机会
我还是会这么做
and given the choice,
I'd do it again.

240
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,244
妹妹，快走
Sister, leave us.

241
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,878
- 我不走
- 我叫你快走
-I'm not going--
-I said, leave us, please.

242
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,889
你听不进她说的
You wouldn't listen to her.

243
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,425
那现在你就得来对付我了
So now you must deal with me.

244
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,276
我研究过伤痛带给人的影响
I've studied the effects
of trauma and abuse.

245
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,471
那些把你推上仪式的女巫
The witches who forced you
into that ritual,

246
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,048
她们欺骗了你，伤害了你
they've lied to you.
They hurt you--

247
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,616
卡蜜
Cami.

248
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,948
你在书本上学到的东西帮不了我
There's nothing you've studied
in some book that can help me.

249
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,612
好
Okay.

250
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,817
那不谈书本上的
Forget the books.

251
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,484
我来告诉你我从经历中学到的东西
Let me tell you
what I know from experience.

252
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,622
我哥哥死后，我以为
我永远都走不出来了
When my brother died,
I never thought I'd be okay again.

253
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,927
我天天以泪洗面，自责，也责怪他
I cried for weeks.
I blamed myself, I blamed him.

254
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:08,768
后来我突然意识到
我整个人被悲伤淹没
And then I realized all that sadness
was swallowing me up

255
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,843
我决心不再这样下去
and I made a choice
I wasn't going to let it.

256
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,378
你也可以做到，黛维娜
You can make that choice, Davina.

257
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,415
你说得好像这很简单
You say that like it's so simple

258
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,645
但那些女巫不会就这样让我走的
but the witches
aren't just gonna let me go.

259
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,278
她们不会放过我的
They're not done with me.

260
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,256
没有人能控制你
除非你允许他们这么做
No one can control you
unless you let them.

261
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,657
我怎么知道谁可以相信？
How do I even know who to trust?

262
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,389
我可以相信马赛尔吗？
Should I trust Marcel?

263
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,593
我后活以后他做的第一件事
The first thing he did
when I came back

264
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,703
就是想再次利用我去帮蕾贝卡
was try to use me again
to help Rebekah.

265
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,999
老实说，卡蜜
Be honest, Cami.

266
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,473
你是不是也有求于我？
Isn't there something
you want too?

267
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,243
是的，我叔叔病了
我想你能帮帮他
Yeah. My uncle is sick.
I thought you could help him.

268
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,652
我不是因为这个才来的
That's not why I'm here.

269
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,551
我关心你
I care about you.

270
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,750
- 我想帮你
- 你怎么帮？
-I want to help you.
-What can you do?

271
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,889
我复活后，耳边的声音
When I came back,
the voices I heard,

272
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,553
都是在说只有那些女巫可以帮我
they said the only ones
who could help me are the witches,

273
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,691
但在我冒犯了她们以后
她们恨我
but after what I did to them,
they hate me.

274
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,497
这叫我怎么回去求她们帮我？
So how can I go back
and ask for their help now?

275
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,745
我真是傻
REBEKAH: What a fool I am.

276
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,284
我还真以为黛维娜会来救我
I actually thought Davina
would come to the rescue.

277
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,945
我会找其他人
全城到处都有女巫
I'll get someone else.
Whole town is full of witches.

278
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,114
但她们都鄙视你
All ofwhom despise you.

279
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,451
我会想出办法
I'll figure this out.

280
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,390
你这段时间就别再激怒克劳斯了
Meantime, just don't piss Klaus off
any more than he already is.

281
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,893
为时已晚
It's a little late for that.

282
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,260
我已经再次激怒他了
I may have provoked him further,

283
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,560
但我已经不在意他的那些谴责
but then, I didn't much care
for his accusations

284
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,067
他说你诱导我把麦可引来
that you seduced me
into bringing Mikael.

285
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,468
拜托，我绝不会那么做的
Wait a minute.
I would never do that.

286
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,101
我们差点就成功了
We almost got away.

287
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,369
如果我们坚持走下去的话
Ifwe just kept going,

288
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,244
我们现在就可以浪迹天涯了
we could be anywhere
in the world by now.

289
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,283
克劳斯或许能追杀到我们
Klaus might've found us
and killed us,

290
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,251
反正他都会那么做
but he'll do that, anyway.

291
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,256
但最起码能先共度短暂的美好时光
Would've been nice
to have a little happiness first.

292
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,883
他不会杀你的，你是他妹妹
He's not gonna kill you.
You're his sister.

293
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,017
而你就像他的孩子
And you're like a son to him

294
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,153
但相信我，他真的会杀了你
and, believe me,
he means to kill you.

295
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,694
知道吗，我从未认真思考过死亡
You know, I've never much thought
about dying,

296
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,740
对于永生的人来说可能倒是种恩赐
one of the perks
of being immortal, I guess.

297
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,080
前一分钟还活着，下一分钟就死了
What an odd thing it is
to be here one minute

298
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,114
感觉好奇怪啊
and gone the next.

299
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,143
好吓人
Rather terrifying.

300
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,224
- 蕾贝卡
- 你快走吧，马赛尔
-Rebekah.
-You need to run, Marcel.

301
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,487
等到月亮升到天空最高处
克劳斯就自由了
When the moon reaches its apex,
Klaus will be free

302
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,291
他会对你做出
比要对我做的更恶劣的事
and he will do to you what
he's going to do to me, only worse.

303
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,826
立刻走，不要回头
Go now and don't look back.

304
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,274
接下来要怎么做呢？
KLAUS: So, what's it gonna be?

305
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,468
两个武器都在你手上
You hold both weapons.

306
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,442
图德的刀可以让我倒下
Tunde's blade
would put me down

307
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,639
而那根木桩可以永远了结我
but the stake
could finish me off for good.

308
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,309
我跟你不同
我没残杀手斗
Well, unlike you, brother.
I have no taste for fratricide.

309
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,320
我只是不能让它落到你手里
I only hold this
to keep it from you.

310
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,382
而它只是给我多了层保障
This is just my insurance.

311
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,983
你为什么要护着她？
Why must you defend her?

312
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,621
当蕾贝卡把麦可引来
她也同样背叛了你
Rebekah betrayed you as well
when she brought Mikael here.

313
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,994
因为她是我们的妹妹
Because she is our sister

314
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,466
因为我更愿意记住她过往的样子
and because I like to remember her
the way that she was

315
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,128
在我们变成这个样子之前
before we became what we became.

316
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,704
她是个天真的小女孩
乐观开朗，充满活力
ELlJAH: She was an innocent girl,
quick to laugh and full of life.

317
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,848
回忆过去只会让我对她的背叛更痛心
My memories serve
to make her betrayal more painful.

318
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,147
难道你就一点责任都没有吗？
Can you not then accept
some small part of the blame?

319
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,585
毕竟，尼克劳斯
-(SCOFFS)
-After all, Niklaus,

320
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,748
是你的残忍才让她做出了那些事
it was your cruelty
that led her to do what she did.

321
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,122
你不明白吗，以利亚
她不是想赶我走
Do you not see, Elijah?
She didn't mean to chase me off.

322
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,695
- 她想要我死
- 你错了
-She wanted me dead.
-You're wrong.

323
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,499
她一直恨我
你知道的
She has always hated me.
You know that's true.

324
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,933
你完全不知道，是不是？
You have no idea, do you?

325
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,901
你完全不知道她为了你做过什么
You have no idea
what she was prepared to do for you.

326
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,237
当我们的妹妹看到
When our sister
sees something

327
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,209
她觉得不公平的事时
that she perceives
to be an injustice,

328
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:13,580
她会很固执很冲动
有时候，甚至很危险
she can be stubborn, impetuous
and, at times, downright dangerous.

329
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,947
这些在她打算
And never was this more apparent

330
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,521
杀死我们父亲的那个夜晚尤为明显
than the night she tried
to kill our father.

331
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,681
这算什么？
What is this?

332
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,522
为了博得我同情的滥情小说吗？
Some melodramatic fiction
designed to garner my sympathy?

333
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,789
这是真的
It is the truth.

334
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,966
我当时也在场
I was there.

335
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,928
如果不是我拦着她
And she would have done it.

336
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,632
她为了保护你，早就下手了
All to protect you,
had I not stopped her.

337
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,105
我常想如果能再回到那一刻
I often wished
that I could revisit that moment,

338
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,275
亲手杀了他就好了
complete the task myself.

339
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,252
你为什么现在跟我说这些？
Why are you telling me this now?

340
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,223
尼克劳斯，有时候我们的妹妹
做事不经大脑
Niklaus, sometimes our sister acts
without thinking.

341
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,122
她脾气火爆
她很容易坠入爱河
She's short of temper.
She's quick to fall in love

342
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,628
但她爱你
but she loves you.

343
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,667
但你的恶意对待伤透了她的心
But your malicious treatment
has broken her heart.

344
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,396
她是做出了反击，召唤了我们的父亲
So, yes, she responded
by summoning our father.

345
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,473
那的确是个错误
Yes, that was a mistake.

346
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,633
但我不确定那是不是她的错
I'm not entirely sure
that I can blame her.

347
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,614
我确定
I can.

348
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,149
尼克劳斯，拜托你
Niklaus, so help me--

349
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,120
你真的要对抗我吗？
Are you really going to stand
against me?

350
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,748
别用那把破刀了
And not with that pathetic blade.

351
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,622
你总有一天要拔出来
You'd just have
to pull it out someday

352
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,389
那时我会恨你，就像现在恨她一样
and then I'd hate you
as I do her now.

353
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,227
你要是想保护蕾贝卡
If you want to protect Rebekah,

354
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,995
你就要用那根白橡树木桩
you'll need to use
the white oak stake.

355
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,468
我不听你胡言乱语
I don't have to listen
to this nonsense.

356
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,437
别装得好像你没想过一样
No, don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

357
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,201
你看着我时
You look at me,

358
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,335
你看到的是在你身上你所憎恶的一切
and you see everything
you abhor in yourself.

359
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,937
虽然你穿着你华丽的西装
Sure, you dress it up
with your fancy suits

360
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,607
口袋里插着手帕
and your handkerchiefs.

361
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,688
尽管你戴着端庄的面具，能言善道
You, with your mask of civility
and eloquence,

362
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,624
但你跟我一样是个令人厌恶的存在
甚至更糟糕
you're every bit
the abomination I am or worse.

363
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,162
来啊，以利亚，来啊
Go on, Elijah.
Go on.

364
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,128
用那白橡树木桩
Use the white oak stake.

365
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,640
我没那么懦弱非得杀了你，尼克劳斯
I'm not so cowardly
that I have to kill you, Niklaus,

366
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,440
但如果只有你受苦才能保护蕾贝卡
but if I have to make you suffer
to protect Rebekah,

367
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,015
我不会手软的
that is what I will do.

368
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,254
看到了吧
(CHUCKLES)
You see?

369
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,946
我就知道你下不了手
I knew you couldn't do it.

370
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,684
你仍然坚信我可以被救赎
You still cling to the hope
that I can be redeemed

371
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:40,662
如果那狗杂种都能被救赎
那或许你就还有希望
and if the bastard can be saved,
then maybe there's hope for you.

372
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,401
好了
There.

373
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,029
现在你知道是什么滋味了
Now you know how it feels.

374
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,177
这话应该是我说才对
That was supposed to be my line.

375
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,047
现在这个在我手上
And now I have this.

376
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,351
谁生谁死我来决定
So I decide who lives
and who dies.

377
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,857
我要把那刀子拿出来
I'm taking out that blade.

378
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,468
那你得先杀了我
You'll have to kill me first

379
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,001
现在能杀我的东西就在你手上
and now you hold the means to do so.

380
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,004
为什么不完成你一世纪前要做的事呢？
Why not finish what you started
a century ago?

381
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,166
我不想要你死，我只想让你离开
I did not want you dead.
I wanted you to run.

382
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,778
骗子！你想要报复
Liar!
You wanted revenge.

383
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,608
你逼我背叛你
You drove me to betray you

384
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,613
现在你想要扭曲事实，让局势更加恶化
and now you want to twist it
and make it worse

385
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,685
这样你就能心安理得地杀了我
而不用承认自己的错误了
so you can justify killing me
instead of accepting your own fault.

386
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,482
我不过是爱上了你的朋友
All I did was love your friend.

387
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,251
你本可以为我们高兴的
You could've been happy for us

388
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:46,626
但你偏执地认为你会失去我们两个
but instead in your paranoia,
you feared losing us both.

389
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,232
正因为如此，你的确失去了我们
And, because of that, you did.

390
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:55,332
怨不得别人，尼克
只能怪你自己
There is no one else to blame, Nik,
only you.

391
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,805
马赛尔现在在哪呢？
And where is Marcel now, hmm?

392
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,846
我以为他是爱你的
I thought he loved you

393
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,382
但他却抛下你，让你和我困在一起
and yet he left you trapped
in here with me.

394
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,817
本市女巫的问题就是方向不明
GENEVlEVE: The trouble with the witches
in this city is they lack direction.

395
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,554
幸好，我们现在有新领袖了
我
Fortunately, our coven has found
a new leader. Me.

396
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,928
你想求我帮忙
减弱莎莉丝特的边界咒语
You ask a favor of me,
to lower Celeste's boundary spell

397
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,297
但你不再能控制女巫了
but you don't control
the witches anymore.

398
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,599
你想帮助女巫
你得跟我们休战
You wanna help your people,
you need to broker peace,

399
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,434
跟吸血鬼签订条约
a treaty with the vampires.

400
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,939
我可以帮忙
I can help.

401
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,839
我上次去谈判的时候
The last time I arrived
for a negotiation,

402
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,206
你还想杀了我
you tried to kill me.

403
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,643
我学到教训了
I learned my lesson.

404
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,214
如果不能打败他们，就跟他们做交易
If you can't beat them,
make them an offer.

405
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,373
交易如下
So here's the deal.

406
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,645
你现在帮我，我向你保证
You help me right now,
you have my word.

407
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,917
吸血鬼不再踏足女巫区
不再有杀戮
Vampires stay out of the Cauldron,
no more executions.

408
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,183
不错的开始
A nice start,

409
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,885
但如果你想要我减弱那咒语
but if you want my help
lowering that spell,

410
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,859
你就要把黛维娜克莱尔交给我们
you're going to have to give us
Davina Claire.

411
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,064
你们还没折磨够那女孩吗？
Haven't your people done enough
to that girl?

412
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,138
你要知道她死后受罪都是因为你
You must know it's your fault
she suffered in death.

413
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,037
她被祖先摒弃，因为她与你为盟
She was shunned by the ancestors
because of her alliance with you

414
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,303
但这都过去了
but all that's over.

415
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,413
现在我们欢迎她回家
Now we can welcome her home.

416
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,879
她会受到尊重
She will be revered
by her people

417
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,712
我会教她如何控制她的力量
and I will teach her
how to control her power,

418
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,376
给她一个安全的家
give her a home where she's safe,

419
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,047
不被吸血鬼包围着
not surrounded by vampires.

420
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,715
把黛维娜带来
Bring Davina to us

421
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,556
我会想办法破解莎莉丝特的咒语
and I'll find a way
to break Celeste's spell.

422
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,290
如果做不到
If not,

423
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,799
这么说吧，反正蕾贝卡的死活与我无关
well, let's just say that I won't be
the one to mourn Rebekah.

424
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,833
你对抗我？
KLAUS: You against me?

425
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,837
这不是公平竞争吧？
我是说
It's hardly a fair fight, is it?
I mean, perhaps,

426
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,102
如果马赛尔在这
也许你还有机会
if Marcel were here,
you'd stand a chance

427
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,508
但我想他已经找到另一个女孩了
but I expect
he's already found another girl,

428
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,104
毫无疑问更加年轻漂亮
no doubt younger and prettier.

429
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,276
你把别人的痛苦当成乐趣
还好奇我为什么会恨你
You take joy in other people's pain
and then you wonder why I hate you.

430
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,981
是的，那样的恨意让你做了那些事
Yes, and that hatred led you
to do what you did.

431
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,422
承认事实吧
承认你想要我死
Admit the truth.
Admit you wanted me dead.

432
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,087
我只想让你离开，仅此而已
随你怎么想
I wanted you to run that is all.
Despite your delusions.

433
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,667
以利亚正痛苦地躺着呢
我同意你去帮他
Elijah lies suffering
and I will allow you to help him.

434
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,701
你只需要承认就行
All you have to do is admit it.

435
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,100
- 你疯了
是的，是的
-You're insane.
-Yes! Yes!

436
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,707
我是邪恶无情的怪物
I am a vicious, heartless monster

437
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,775
所以你就召唤了麦可来杀我
承认吧
and so you summoned Mikael
to kill me. Admit it.

438
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,606
- 不是这样的
- 你知道自己做了什么，承认吧
-It's not true!
-You know what you did. Admit it.

439
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,680
- 我没有
- 你就是想要我死！
-I didn't.
-You wanted me dead!

440
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,218
承认吧
Admit it.

441
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,996
也许是的
Maybe I did.

442
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:41,794
尼克，我…
Nik, l--

443
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,242
你没刺中我的心脏
You missed my heart.

444
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,812
也许是吧
Perhaps I did.

445
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,619
也许我从没想过要杀死你
Or perhaps
I never meant to kill you.

446
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,450
也许我只是想让你感受一丁点
父亲来找我时
Perhaps I just wanted you
to feel a fraction the fear I felt

447
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,855
我所感受到的恐惧
when father came for me.

448
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,322
你自己知道真相吗？
Do you yourself know the truth?

449
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,760
我知道这点
I know this.

450
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,389
你怪我做尽坏事
You accuse me of being evil

451
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,230
但你却是密谋想要
and yet you are the one
who conspired

452
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,997
杀死自己亲哥哥的人
to kill your own blood.

453
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:51,302
你让我们过得生不如死
你折磨我们
You made our lives a living hell.
You tormented us.

454
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,877
我爱我的家人
I love my family.

455
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,709
爱你，爱以利亚
You, Elijah.

456
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,378
我爱你们所有人
I loved all of you.

457
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:16,898
我知道我不易相处
但这不是我造成的
I know I can be difficult
but I did not make myself this way.

458
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,002
是麦可毁了我
It was Mikael who ruined me.

459
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,665
他也毁了我
He ruined me too.

460
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,004
你却忘了这点
That's what you forget.

461
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,281
几个世纪后，我们每个人都伤痕累累
Centuries later,
each of us is broken.

462
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,515
你愤怒多疑
You with your anger and paranoia.

463
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:43,959
我害怕被抛弃
Me with my fear of abandonment.

464
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,624
而可怜的以利亚
And poor Elijah.

465
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:54,201
他不顾自己，全心全意为我们每一个人
He dedicates himself to everyone
but himself.

466
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,144
我们是这世上最强大的生物
We are the strongest creatures
in the world

467
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,143
但却被摧残得无法痊愈了
and yet we are damaged
beyond repair.

468
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:09,142
我们没有希望地活着
却永远不会死去
We live without hope
but we will never die.

469
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,789
被诅咒者说的就是我们
We are the definition of "cursed."

470
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,857
直到永远
Always and forever.

471
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,842
- 她怎么样了？
- 情绪低落
-How is she?
-Depressed.

472
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,671
她需要真正的帮助
She needs real help,

473
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,904
也许待在一个能够让她得到全天候照顾
maybe a stay in an institution

474
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,707
和医疗帮助的地方最好
where she can get round-the-clock
care and medication.

475
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,372
不不，她待在那样的地方
No, no, no.
She stays in a place like that,

476
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,813
就永远出不来了
she is never getting out.

477
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,351
你有更好的主意吗？
You have a better idea?

478
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,819
我们可以把她送回她的族人身边
We take her back to her people.

479
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,650
什么？
What?

480
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,694
有更重大的事要发生了，卡蜜
There are bigger things
going on here, Cami.

481
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,422
这是她唯一的机会
It's the only chance that she has.

482
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,659
- 我们得好好商量这件事
- 我不是在请求你的允许
-We have to talk about this.
-I'm not asking for permission.

483
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,092
现在我们扯平了
Now we're even.

484
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,938
- 那我们说定了？
- 黛维娜在睡觉
-So we have a deal?
-Davina is asleep.

485
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,944
等她醒来，我会向她解释一切
When she wakes up,
I'll explain everything.

486
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,070
然后我会带她过来
Then I'll bring her here.

487
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,046
在此期间，我们得削弱那个屏障
Meantime, we need
to lower that barrier.

488
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,119
莎莉丝特施了一个强大的咒语
Celeste cast a powerful spell.

489
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,119
算你走运，她死了
Fortunately for you, she's gone.

490
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,986
她的力量重新回到大地
Her power bled back into the earth.

491
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,754
现在我可以引导它，操纵它
Now I can channel it, manipulate it.

492
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,298
这需要费点工夫
但我对我做的事很在行
It'll take some doing but then,
I'm pretty good at what I do.

493
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,732
还有一件事
我需要你治好神父
One more thing,
I need you to fix the priest.

494
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,203
抱歉
Sorry.

495
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,865
像那样的诅咒
如果让它有时间生根
A hex like that,
if it's had time to take root,

496
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,477
就没办法撤销了
there's no undoing it.

497
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,444
好吧，把蕾贝卡救出来就行
Fine.
Just get Rebekah out.

498
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,982
我得撤销整个咒语
I'll have to undo the entire spell.

499
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,313
不可能让一个真祖出来
而把其他人留在里面
Can't let one Original out
without letting them all out.

500
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,442
没关系
It doesn't matter.

501
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,182
只是你要知道
即使克劳斯自由了
And just so you know,
even if Klaus is free,

502
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,985
如果你敢伤害黛维娜…
if you hurt Davina in any way--

503
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,290
马赛尔，结束了
你输了
Marcel, it's over.
You lost.

504
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,331
试着留点尊严吧
Try and have a little dignity.

505
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,432
我们还是被困在这里
We're still trapped in here.

506
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,167
你想对我做什么，现在就动手吧
Whatever you're going to do to me,
do it now.

507
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,608
你说父亲毁了我们
You said our father ruined us.

508
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:56,878
我不禁好奇
如果是他的父亲毁了他呢？
And I can't help but wonder,
what if his father ruined him?

509
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,287
屏障撤销了
The barrier is down.

510
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,764
我知道你恨我，但木已成舟
I know you hate me
but what's done is done.

511
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,235
其实不然
What's done is never done.

512
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,703
都留在我们心中
It remains within us,

513
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,073
变成我们给自己的故事
这样我们就知道我们到底是谁
the story we tell ourselves
so we know who we are.

514
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:26,946
邪恶的父亲
私生子
Vicious father, a bastard son...

515
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,216
还有一个背叛他的妹妹
...and the sister who betrayed him.

516
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,087
也许是时候开始新的故事了
Perhaps it's time for a new story.

517
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,665
你想要什么，蕾贝卡？
What is it you want, Rebekah?

518
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,034
打从儿时起我就想要的东西
Same things that I have wanted
since I was a child.

519
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,739
我想要一个家，一个家庭
I want a home.
I want a family.

520
00:31:54,879 --> 00:32:00,044
想要有人爱我
我想要活着
I want someone to love me
and I want to live.

521
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,049
那去吧
Then go.

522
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,525
走得远远的，永远不要回来
Go far away and never come back.

523
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,621
我们已经伤痕累累，无法待在一起
We are far too damaged
to remain together,

524
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,258
不像是家人
更像是一堆易爆的材料
Iess a family now
than a volatile mix of ingredients.

525
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,735
纽奥良将是我的
New Orleans will be mine.

526
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,275
我要在这里养育我的孩子
在这个你从我手中夺走的城市里
I will raise my child here
in the city you took from me.

527
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,474
毫无疑问，以利亚会选择留下
No doubt,
Elijah will choose to stay.

528
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:36,646
但是你，妹妹
But you, sister...

529
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,853
你自由了
You are free.

530
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,841
我就想会在这里找到你
I thought I might find you here.

531
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,501
我只是来收拾最后一些
I just came to collect
the last of my things

532
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,203
没被烧成灰烬的东西
that didn't burn to ash.

533
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,440
我很快就会离开
I'll be leaving shortly.

534
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,051
我想你不会想要跟我一起走
I don't suppose you have any desire
to join me.

535
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,550
我衷心希望你能找到你在寻找的一切
I do hope you find everything
you're looking for.

536
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,795
以利亚，在我把麦可引来时
Elijah, when I brought Mikael,

537
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,161
我绝对没有想要伤害你
I never for a second meant
to hurt you.

538
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,026
我知道
I know.

539
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,401
但我确定克劳斯是真的想杀死我
And I was certain
that Klaus meant to kill me.

540
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:10,045
不论是他从没有真正做过
还是他改变了主意
Whether he never really did at all
or he changed his mind.

541
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,083
也许在内心深处
Maybe somewhere deep down,

542
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,380
他仍是我们曾经熟悉的兄弟
he still is the brother
we once knew.

543
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,890
很深，不过…
Buried deep, but...

544
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,760
那个他还在
...he's still in there.

545
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,370
帮他走上正轨
Help him find his way.

546
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,855
是什么原因让你们这么多人
在我家闲逛？
Is there a reason why you lot
are loitering in my home?

547
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,523
我叫他们来的
MARCEL: I asked them
to be here.

548
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,129
你和我需要公开地解决这事
You and I need to settle this
out in the open.

549
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,333
我还以为你早就跑了
I thought
you would've run off by now.

550
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,493
是啊，不过这可是我的城市
Yeah.
Well, this is my town.

551
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,270
你也许想要我请求你宽恕
但我毫无歉意
You may want me to beg forgiveness,
but I'm not sorry.

552
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,570
我也许没有能力打败你
但我到这里来面对你
I may not be able to beat you,
but I came here to face you.

553
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,340
在我的人面前做个了结
To end this in front of my people.

554
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,487
如果你要因此杀了我
就动手吧
If you're gonna kill me for that,
get on with it.

555
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,173
晚安
Good evening.

556
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,512
我想我就不用自我介绍了
I trust I need no introduction.

557
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,179
这里曾是我的家
毕竟
After all, this was once
my family home.

558
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,520
我要收回这里
今晚
Tonight, I'm taking it back.

559
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,618
你在这里的权力已被取消
Your privileges here
have been revoked.

560
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,391
马赛勒斯，出于对我妹妹的尊重
Marcellus,
out of respect for my sister,

561
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,093
我这次就手下留情
I will grant you this one mercy.

562
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,136
允许你留着你的小命
I will allow you to keep your life.

563
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,330
然而，你被驱逐了
However, you're hereby exiled.

564
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,242
如果我在法语区发现你的踪迹
If I so much as find a trace of you
in the French Quarter,

565
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:25,280
你不会有好下场的
明白了吗？
it will not end well for you.
Do you understand?

566
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,120
就这样
走吧
That is all.
Run along.

567
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,027
干得好，哥哥
Nicely done, brother.

568
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,832
你说话的语气开始像我了
真不错
You're beginning to sound like me.
I'm impressed.

569
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,480
我在想
REBEKAH: I was thinking.

570
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,350
我母亲被供奉，埋葬在这里
My mother was consecrated
and buried here.

571
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:11,421
她被永远束缚在这片土地了
但我没有
She is forever bound to this land,
but not me.

572
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,592
我终于自由了
I'm finally free.

573
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,359
你呢？
And you?

574
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,533
你的哥哥们一来，就把这里据为己有
Your brothers came in this town
like they own the place,

575
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,939
好像我是他们的仆人
Iike they own me.

576
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,577
夺走了我的家、我的人
Took my home, my people,

577
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,547
我的一切
everything.

578
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,783
我不能就这么跑掉
I can't just run away.

579
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,290
我没要求你这么做
I'm not asking you to.

580
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,085
我不是傻瓜
I'm not a fool.

581
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,056
我知道你有多爱这城市
I see how much
you love this city,

582
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,763
而我不是那种愿意和人分享的女孩
and I am not the kind of girl
who likes to share.

583
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,484
我真心希望你建好了我们的家
I do wish
you had finished building our home.

584
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,819
即使我从未去过
Even if I'd never set foot inside...

585
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,292
如果经历这一切之后
...it would have been nice

586
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:24,699
还有美好的东西能留下来
那就真的太好了
if there was something beautiful
left standing after all of this.

587
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,979
再见，马赛尔杰拉德
Goodbye, Marcel Gerard.

588
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,352
要努力好好活着
Do try to stay alive.

589
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,016
蕾贝卡，你怎么来了？
Rebekah, what are you doing here?

590
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,684
我是来道别的
I came to say goodbye.

591
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,849
不是说好我们女孩要团结在一起的吗？
What happened to us girls
sticking together?

592
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:24,126
我和尼克达成了一个
要么死要么走的协定
Well, Nik and I came to a sort
of all-or-nothing arrangement.

593
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,829
我永远离开这里，他同意了
I leave town for good,
he allows me to.

594
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,159
真的没法拒绝呢
Can't pass that up.

595
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,096
和克劳斯待了一千年
(SCOFFS)
A thousand years with Klaus,

596
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,636
我想你应该享受几天假期
I guess you deserve
a few vacation days.

597
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,230
听着，关于尼克
他是个怪物
Listen.
About Nik, he is a monster.

598
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,401
千万不要惹他生气
Do not ever cross him,

599
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,980
但他真的想要从生活中得到更多
而不只是被畏惧
but he does want more from life
than to just be feared.

600
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,549
他受过太多伤，以至于迷失了自己
He's too broken to find it himself...

601
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,147
但我相信他还是有希望的
...but I do believe
there is hope for him

602
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,887
那就是你肚子里的这个孩子
in the baby that you carry.

603
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,016
说到你的孩子
And speaking of your child,

604
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,219
我们家族树敌无数
our family has no shortage
of enemies.

605
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,727
她将会继承一切
She will inherit all of them.

606
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,423
请你一定要小心
Please be careful.

607
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,932
你随时可以回来探望我们
You know you can always come back
and visit.

608
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,907
我一直知道应该对克劳斯
隐瞒一两个秘密
I've been known
to keep a secret or two from Klaus.

609
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,438
如果我没法回来
Well, if I can't,

610
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,103
你一定要告诉这个小丫头
you make sure
to tell that little girl

611
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,046
她疯狂姑姑贝卡的故事
stories of her crazy Auntie Beks.

612
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,175
让她知道
And let her know that...

613
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,449
尽管我不在
我一样非常爱她
...despite my absence,
I do love her very much.

614
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,078
