1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,469
很开心你安全回来了
I'm glad to see you made it safely.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,904
酒店怎么样?
How's your hotel?

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:09,141
这并不是我住过的最好的百维顿酒店
It's not the best Best Western I've been to,

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,876
但差不多是...
but I'd say it's...

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,879
我去过第三好的百维顿酒店
the third best Best Western I've been to.

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,514
我懂
I know how you feel.

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,518
我家附近的百思买是第三好的百思买
The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,253
他们有百思买
They have the best buys,

9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,989
{\an8}Bestbuy是美国电子产品零售商, 中文为百思买, Best意为最好的, 此处为双关

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,989
但如果只是几百种货物便宜点
but having the best buys isn't the only thing

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,292
还不足以让它被称为最好的百思买
that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.

12
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,030
那什么才能让一个百思买成为最好的百思买?
What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,332
嗯 这问题问得好
Mm, that's a great question.

14
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,901
{\an8}美国知名墨西哥卷饼店

15
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,901
如果他开在Chipotle旁边的话我会喜欢
I like when they're next to a Chipotle.

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,738
嗯 我得去整理行李了
Okay, well, I should unpack.

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,706
好吧
All right.

18
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,608
享受你的神经生物学研讨会吧
Enjoy the neurobiology conference.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,775
我会的
I will.

20
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,378
我... 希望你能在这
I... wish you were here.

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
在这个神经生物学研讨会上吗?
At a neurobiology conference?

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,549
这是什么话?
What a mean thing to say.

23
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,153
嗯 我很开心你不在这里?
Okay, I'm glad you're not here?

24
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,155
啊 每次我一告诉你该怎么说
Aw, you always know just what to say

25
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,258
你就知道该怎么说了
after I tell you what to say.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,727
再见 Sheldon
Good-bye, Sheldon.

27
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,061
再见
Bye.

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,863
哦 好消息 先生们
Oh! Good news, gentlemen.

29
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,732
Amy这周末去参加了一个研讨会
Amy's at a conference this weekend,

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,202
也就是说我可以娱乐了
which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm.

31
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,840
就像现在小年轻们说的: 谁带我浪一浪?
As today's youth might put it: Who wants to get their Sheld-on?

32
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,943
Bernie和我在准备给房子进行改造
Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel.

33
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,045
多个人帮忙总是好事
We could always use an extra pair of hands.

34
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,347
好无聊 Raj?
That sounds awful. Raj?

35
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,117
嗯 我预约了这周末的望远镜室
Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,218
来寻找星际行星
scanning for rogue planets.

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,920
很欢迎你加入我
You're more than welcome to join me.

38
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,888
这个有待考虑 Leonard?
That's the one to beat. Leonard?

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,492
啊 我打算不带你浪
Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.

40
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,961
嗯 看来有人胜出了 祝贺你
Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.

41
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,697
嗯 我应该警告你的 其实只是
Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data

42
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,933
盯着电脑屏幕上的数据不停地看
for hours and hours on a computer screen.

43
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,201
嗯 不用推销了 你赢了
Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.

44
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,940
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

45
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,276
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

46
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,878
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,447

Hey.

56
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:14,655
- 你好  - 好啊
- Hey.  - Hello.

57
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,522
嘿 你今天过的怎么样?
Hi. How was your day?

58
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:17,623
哦 不太好
Oh, not good.

59
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,825
还是见不到Gallo医生
Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.

60
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:21,427
医生?
A doctor?

61
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:23,863
希望你得的不是传染性的
Well, I hope you're not contagious.

62
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:25,931
我这周末准备待在望远镜室里
I've got a weekend in the telescope room

63
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,601
我已经激动了三分钟了
I've been excited about for almost three minutes.

64
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:31,470
我没生病 是为了工作
I'm not sick. It's for work.

65
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,806
这个医生一个药品推销员都不想见
There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps.

66
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,441
我已经试着接触他好几个月了
I've been trying to get in for months.

67
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:36,976
你试过穿那件
Well, did you try wearing the shirt

68
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,611
我说不适合穿去上班的衬衫了吗?
I said was inappropriate for work?

69
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:41,447
嗯 这个医生是女的 但...
Well, the doctor's a woman, but...

70
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,649
我穿了 什么样的人都有
yes, because you never know.

71
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,085
她是什么样的医生?
What kind of doctor is she?

72
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,087
嗯 一个精神科医生 怎么了?
Um, a psychiatrist. Why?

73
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:50,489
如果你假装病人预约她来看病呢?
Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient?

74
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,224
这样你就能和她说话了
Then you'll get to talk to her.

75
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:54,326
他们已经知道我是药品推销员了
Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

76
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:56,028
哦 那如果Leonard预约
Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment

77
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,063
然后给你打好铺垫呢?
and tried to lay some groundwork for you?

78
00:02:58,065 --> 00:02:59,498
有意思
That's interesting.

79
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,267
我才不和精神科医生
I'm not gonna make a fake appointment

80
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,234
做假预约呢
with a psychiatrist.

81
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:04,003
我有什么毛病?
What would I say is wrong with me?

82
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,538
- 低自尊心  - 社交恐惧
- Low self-esteem.  - Social anxiety.

83
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,873
性不安全感
Sexual insecurity.

84
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,309
这都不对
None of that is true.

85
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:13,145
否认 看啊 我还能说出一大堆
Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.

86
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:14,680
太扯了
That's just crazy.

87
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,782
我进去后能帮你什么忙?
How would my going in there even help you?

88
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,084
我不知道啊 你可以和她说话啊 如果她提起来的话
I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up,

89
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,486
你可以问问她听没听说过这个药
you could ask if she's heard about the drug.

90
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:21,720
如果我被揭穿怎么办?
What if I get caught?

91
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,155
畏惧失败! 缺乏自信!
Fear of failure! Lack of confidence!

92
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,057
胆小鬼!
Kind of a wuss!

93
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:27,726
好吧 我去
Fine, I'll do it.

94
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,262
但是不是因为他们 而是因为我爱你
But not because of them, because I love you.

95
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:30,996
谢谢
Thank you.

96
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,198
- 墙头草  - 没骨气
- Pushover.  - Spineless.

97
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,098
两天前就和他说过的牛奶
Still hasn't bought milk

98
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,034
到今天都没买回来!
even though I told him two days ago!

99
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,907
真是无与伦比啊
That was incredible.

100
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,409
是啊
It was.

101
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:45,411
我只希望Stuart不在这
I just wish Stuart wasn't around

102
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,480
我们就不用这么小声了
so we didn't have to be so quiet.

103
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,914
同感
I know.

104
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,649
他看日本色情动漫时
It's not like he returns the favor

105
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,153
也完全不在意一下我们的感受
when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.

106
00:03:55,323 --> 00:03:57,223
你俩有空吗
You guys got a minute,

107
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,791
还是正后戏拥抱着呢?
or are you still cuddling?

108
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:01,760
怎么了 Stuart?
What is it, Stuart?

109
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,429
我能进门吗?
Can I come in?

110
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,730
等一下
Hang on.

111
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:06,765
要不要把他赶走?
Should I send him away?

112
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,000
不用 没事的
No, it's okay.

113
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,536
谢谢 Bernie
Thanks, Bernie.

114
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,406
怎么了?
What's up?

115
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:16,075
我知道 
Uh, well, I know

116
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,511
我知道你们要重新装修了 所以为了让你们容易点
the remodel is coming up, so I thought I'd make it easy

117
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,779
是时候找个自己的住处了
on you guys and find my own place.

118
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,648
哇
Wow.

119
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,718
我还以为今天的高潮已经过去了呢
I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.

120
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,053
你准备什么时候搬出去啊?
So, when are you thinking of moving?

121
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,855
实际上 我已经找到公寓了
Uh, actually, I already found an apartment,

122
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,457
所以就这几天吧
so in a couple of days.

123
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,660
好吧
Oh. Okay.

124
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:37,229
听到你要离开 很抱歉?
Sorry to see you go?

125

总之 谢谢你俩为我做的一切
Okay, well, thank you guys for everything.

126

我... 我非常感谢你们
I... I really appreciate it.

127
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:43,969
一点也不用谢
You're very welcome.

128
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,642
怎么了?
What?

129
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:53,312
你俩醒着的时候 我还没来过这房间呢
Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you're awake.

130
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,891
你在干啥呢?
What are you doing?

131
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:09,695
调节望远镜摄像头的白平衡
Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.

132
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:13,432
你现在又在干啥呢?
What are you doing now?

133
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,901
还是在调节望远镜摄像头的
Still making sure the telescope's camera

135
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:24,610

How about now?

现在我在调节望远镜摄像头的
Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera

137

白平衡 而且希望你能有个填色本打发时间

138
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,785
我可以帮你的忙啊

139
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,253
找点事情给我做吧
Give me something to do.

00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:36,522
有次我爸爸带我去上班
You know, my father took me to work once,

141
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:38,157
而十分钟之内我就发现
and in ten minutes I figured out

142
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,858
一直以来谁在收银机里偷钱了
who'd been stealing from the cash register.

143

虽然我爸爸失业了
Yeah, Dad lost his job,

145
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:47,132
但是Hinckley先生给了我一根巧克力棒
but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.

146
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:49,468
好吧 你想做事吗?
Fine, you want something to do?

147
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,705
这个硬盘里有六个月的数据
There's about six months of data on this hard drive.

148
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,773
你慢慢审阅一遍 看看能不能找到
Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot

149
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,808
有什么模式或者异常
any patterns or anomalies.

150
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,077
行 让我来吧 嘿 瞧瞧啊!
Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that!

00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,281
一个印度人在给白人分配电脑任务
An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.

152
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,783
行吧 不管怎样
Yeah, okay, whatever it takes

153
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:06,619
这事能让你忙几个小时的
to keep you busy for a few hours.

154
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,455
找到一个了
Found one.

155
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:10,556
你才没有呢
No, you didn't.

156
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:13,125
这里面有数百万的数据点呢
There are millions of data points there.

157
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,861
但是你看呀 这是光学瞬态
But, look, an optical transient.

158
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:17,463
的确 还真给你找到了
Yeah, maybe that is something.

159
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,765
- 你怎么找到的?  - 这不难的
- How did you find that?  - It wasn't difficult.

160
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:23,002
你知不知道 看到质数的时候 它们是红色的
You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red,

161
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,637
而孪生素数
but when they're twin primes,

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,739
就是粉色的 还有汽油味儿?
they're pink and smell like gasoline?

163
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:29,708
没听说过
No.

164
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,911
那就是我天赋异禀吧
Oh. I guess I'm a special boy.

165
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:35,614
一般遇到天赋异禀的男孩
You know, sometimes when a boy is special,

166
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,549
别人会给他巧克力棒吃的
he gets a Fudgsicle.

167
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,719
而且 尝起来犹如光速
Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.

168
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,824
临时通知还能见到你 太感谢了
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

169
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,226
不用谢
Ah, it's my pleasure.

170
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,227
我很好奇
I'm curious,

171
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:51,063
你和Beverly Hofstadter博士有亲属关系吗?
are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?

172
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,565
她是我的母亲 你认识她吗?
Uh, she's my mother. You know her?

173
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,667
不 没有见过面
No, not personally,

174
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,669
但是我读过她的书
but I have read all of her books.

175
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:58,804
好吧 那估计你比我更了解她了
Well, then you know her better than I do.

176
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:00,706
这我可不敢说
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

177
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,108
但我跟你说
But I can tell you I do not agree

178
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,944
我完全不认同她的育儿理论
with her theories on child rearing at all.

179
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:08,147
真的吗?
Really?

180
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,883
你是觉得它们太冷酷 太残忍
Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable

181
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:14,386
根本不适合一个只想过得开心的小男孩吗?
for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?

182
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:15,821
其实我不想多说的...
Well, I didn't want to say it...

183
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,289
没关系 说吧 唱出来都行
No, no, say it. Sing it.

184
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,325
租一架飞机 写在天上
Rent a plane, write it in the sky.

185
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,794
看来你心中
Sounds like you're holding on

186
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,329
对她非常不满啊
to quite a bit of anger towards her.

187
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,364
没有 我在这方面
Oh, no, I've worked through

188
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,765
下过不少功夫 我现在已经好多了
a lot of that stuff; I'm better now.

189
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:27,800
嗯 真不错
Mm. Good for you.

190
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:29,234
你知道吗 她从来不让我过生日
Do you know she never let me

191
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,936
因为她觉得我出生
celebrate my birthday because being born

192
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,939
是她的功劳 和我没关系?
was her achievement, not mine?

193
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,174
真是令人心碎
That's heartbreaking.

194
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:38,477
对吧? 到现在了我每年生日还会给她寄一张贺卡
Right? To this day, I send her a card every year

195
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,080
里面还夹点钱
with a little money in it.

196
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,584
等到我们搬回来的时候
You know, once we get the house back to ourselves,

197
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:48,587
我们就可以到处浪漫了
we can be romantic in any room we want.

198
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,890
太好了 我终于可以带你去看洗衣房了
Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.

199
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,694
当初你让我搬进来
Boy, who would've thought

200
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:58,430
照顾你妈妈的时候 谁能想到
when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom,

201
00:07:58,432 --> 00:07:59,932
我在这里待了整整两年?
I'd still be here two years later?

202
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,801
- 没人想得到  - 没人
- Nobody thought that.  - No one.

203
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:05,704
就这样了
Well, that's it.

204
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,339
是啊
I guess so.

205
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:11,410
这感觉真奇怪
This is weird.

206
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:15,347
是啊 一个成年人要搬回自己家了
Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment.

207
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,249
太疯狂了 再见!
Crazy times. See ya!

208
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,853
别管他
Ignore him.

209
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:23,055
他只是靠开玩笑来表达...
He's just using humor to express how...

210
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,190
他的喜悦
happy he is.

211
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,593
没事 我知道他是爱我的
It's okay. I know he loves me.

212
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,595
当然
Sure he does.

213
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,867
等到你安顿好了告诉我们一声
Well, let us know when you're all settled in.

214
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:38,637
我会的 真是感激不尽
I will. And I really can't thank you guys enough.

215
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,372
不用谢
Our pleasure.

216
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:42,708
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,345
他走啦!
He's gone!

218
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,881
我们从车库开始吧!
Let's start in the garage!

219
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,238
好的 等到我们收到下一个图像
Okay, so once we receive the next image

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,174
把它和我们现有的图像做对比
and compare it to the ones we've already collected,

221
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,809
我们就知道我们发现的是什么了
we'll know what it is that we found.

222
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,612
哦 可能是日鞘闪烁
Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.

223
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,915
也有可能是一个海王星外天体
It could be a trans-Neptunian object.

224
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,917
可能是一个新的行星
Maybe it's a new planet.

225
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,319
不太可能 不过它有可能是一个矮行星
Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.

226
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:19,854
只要它的引力正常
Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity

227
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,422
还有卫星 我就满足了
and all its moons, I'll be happy.

228
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,393
好吧 最后的图像收到了
Okay, the final image is coming in.

229
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,361
我们发现的东西是...
And the object we discovered is...

230
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:28,763
加油
Come on,

231
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:32,767
爸爸要用铁腕统治星球了
Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.

232
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,436
一个中等大小的小行星
A medium-sized asteroid.

233
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:36,838
就这么点?
That's it?

234
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,339
太平常了
How common.

235
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,876
就好像是宇宙的菜单上那道上校鸡块
That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.

236
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,644
我挺喜欢上校鸡块的
I kind of like chicken fingers.

237
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:46,214
我也是 我只是不知道怎么比喻了
Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.

238
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,549
算了吧 一个中等大小的小行星
Come on, a medium-sized asteroid

239
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,484
也算是有趣的发现了
is still an interesting discovery.

240
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,186
我想它也许会
I suppose it could end up

241
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:55,990
撞向地球 毁灭一切生物吧
on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.

242
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,559
你的梦和我的真的不太一样
You dream different than me.

243
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,096
真可爱
It is kind of cute.

244
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,265
是啊 而且我们可以给它取名字了
Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.

245
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,768
我们最好取一个别人不会笑话的名字
We better choose a name no one can make fun of.

246
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,239
{\an8}"天王星"在英文中与"撒尿"很像

247
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,239
弗里德里希·威廉·赫歇尔爵士给天王星取的这个名字可太难听了
Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favors.

248
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,844
嗨
Hi.

249
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,679
- 嘿 那件事顺利吗?  - 很棒
- Hey, how'd it go?  - Oh, great.

250
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,848
Gallo医生太棒了
Dr. Gallo is terrific.

251
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,216
我... 我一直有一种不安全感
You know, I... I've always been insecure

252
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,118
以为别人都不在乎我想说什么
that no one cares about what I have to say,

253
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,319
但是她让我看到了...
but she made me see...

254
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,089
是没人在乎 你到底帮我了没有?
Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?

255
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,191
好吧 我知道
Okay, n-now, what I'm hearing

256
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,360
你感觉我有时候花太多时间
is that you feel that I sometimes take too long

257
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:33,694
表达我自己了
to express myself,

258
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,463
你希望我能说话简洁一点
and you wish I'd be more succinct.

259
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:36,497
你知道是因为我
You're only hearing that because

260
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,733
翻白眼都翻出声音来了
I cannot roll my eyes any louder.

261
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,802
好吧 就在我们谈论过我和我母亲的问题之后...
All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother...

262
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:44,538
没那么深入 只是她怎么毁了我的生活...
nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life...

263
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,907
我跟她讲了你还有你的药物
I told her about you

264
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,142
她说她很乐意见你
and your drug; she said she'd be happy to meet you.

265
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,243
真的
Really?

266
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,913
噢 你是最棒的老公!
Oh, you're the best husband ever!

267
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:55,917
所以你下周要陪我去神秘博士大会了?
So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?

268
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,485
我想是吧
I guess.

269
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:01,589
这次我的确听见你翻白眼了
Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.

270
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,428
天啊 Stuart上次打扫这个地方是什么时候的事了?
Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?

271
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,796
不开玩笑
No kidding.

272
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,631
我要把一些脏东西吸起来了
Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up.

273
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,733
你觉得这东西听起来像什么?
What do you think this object sounds like?

274
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,970
Howie 我不想再玩"积木指甲还是药片"的游戏了
Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,274
你觉得我们该拿这个房间怎么办?
So, what do you think we should do with this room?

276
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,677
我考虑过家庭影院或者游戏室...
Well, I was thinking a home theater or a gaming room...

277
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,912
你看 就像男人的窝
you know, like a man cave.

278
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:26,380
为什么不能是女人的窝?
Why can't it be a woman cave?

279
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:28,416
只要这房里有家庭影院 游戏机
As long as it has a home theater, a video game system

280
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,517
而你也不许进来
and you're not allowed in it,

281
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,752
那么你爱叫它什么都可以
you can call it whatever you want.

282
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,754
我说认真的
I'm being serious.

283
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,990
那你觉得我们该怎么办?
Well, what do you think we should do?

284
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:37,091
我不知道
I don't know,

285
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,560
也许装成家庭办公室或者...
maybe a home office or...

286
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,028
噢
Oh.

287
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,463
看啊
Look.

288
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:45,399
我们带Stuart去夜市那晚他赢回来的泰迪熊
The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.

289
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,600
噢
Oh.

290
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:49,670
他可兴奋了
He was so excited.

291
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:50,905
是啊
Yeah.

292
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,673
无论他们想什么办法
You know, no matter how hard they tried,

293
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:55,409
都猜不出他的年纪
they could not guess his age.

294
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:58,112
下次看见他的时候我带给他
I'll give it to him next time I see him.

295
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,785
自从他走后你有他的消息吗?
Have you heard from him since he left?

296
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,003
没有
No.

297
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:04,051
还以为一旦他安顿下来就会给我们打电话的
You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.

298
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,753
也许他忙着呢
Hmm. Maybe he's busy.

299
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,288
没时间打电话? 他可有时间
Too busy to call? He wasn't too busy

300
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,591
用我Hulu网站的密码看 魅力克利夫兰
to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.

301
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,662
怎么回事?
What is happening?

302
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:17,164
我们想他了吗?
Are we missing him?

303
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,768
不是 这种感觉不是想他
No, that's not what this feeling is.

304
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,937
是想他吗?
Is it?

305
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,339
当然不是 他把我们逼疯了
Of course not. He drove us crazy.

306
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:27,141
像上次你要做一个派
Like when you were gonna make that pie

307
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:30,745
结果Stuart提前吃光了所有的蓝莓
and Stuart ate all the blueberries.

308
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,981
他还想不承认 可他的牙都是紫的
And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.

309
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:37,718
太可爱了
That was pretty cute.

310
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
是啊
Yeah.

311
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,722
恶... 我们想他了!
Ew, we are missing him!

312
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,828
我在考虑 也许我们可以通过把咱俩的名字连起来
So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name

313
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,464
来给这个小行星起名字
for the asteroid by combining our names.

314
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,932
这个想法不错
That's a great idea.

315
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,434
我想到了
I've got it.

316
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:56,303
我们叫它... Cooper
We'll call it... Cooper.

317
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,774
不是说咱们俩的名字吗?
How is that both our names?

318
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:03,878
Koothrappali的Koo Cooper的per
"Koo" from Koothrappali and "per" from Cooper.

319
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,547
那么 就像是 K开头的Kooper?
Yeah, so... so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?

320
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,249
你说得对 那个太傻了
Nah, you're right, that's dumb.

321
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,584
嘿
Hey.

322
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:11,986
Leopard 好消息
Oh, Leonard, great news.

323
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:15,423
我们一起发现了一个中型小行星
We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.

324
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,124
哇 太棒了!
Wow, that's amazing!

325
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,193
我今儿也心情不错
I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.

326
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:22,196
好了 想来现在我们要谈你的事情了
Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.

327
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:25,099
是的 因为Gallo医生让我意识到
Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize

328
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,868
我是个有价值的人而且我的感受很重要
that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.

329
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,872
网上那些猫图早就让我免费了解到了 可还是给你赞一个
I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.

330
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,276
好了 讲讲我的事情
Okay, back to me.

331
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,179
我发现了一个小行星 现在得给他命名
I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.

332
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,880
等等 说好的我们呢?
Wait, what happened to us?

333
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,115
现在 这不是关于我们
Now, this isn't about us,

334
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,284
而是关于怎样才对小行星最好
this is about what's best for the asteroid.

335
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:46,754
你考虑怎么命名?
What are you thinking of naming it?

336
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,456
我还没做任何决定
I haven't settled on anything yet.

337
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,291
我们还没做任何决定
We haven't settled on anything yet.

338
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,828
好了 猫图 你坚持住啊
All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.

339
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,363
知道怎样最好吗?用你们的女朋友给它命名
You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends.

340
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,932
让她们了解有多在乎她们
Show them how much you care.

341
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,334
这个主意太棒了
That is a great idea.

342
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,635
完美
It's perfect.

343
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,938
看起来很浪漫 
It appears romantic, but it's really just

344
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,206
可只是一块太空里
a rock in space that gets me

345
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,740
能让我永远摆脱麻烦的情人节的石头而已
out of Valentine's Day forever.

346
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:11,579
所以 呃 你觉得呢? 把她们的名字合起来?
So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?

347
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:12,880
我觉得不错
I like it.

348
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,916
所以说我们取Amy的”A和M”然后
Yeah, we'll take the "AM" from Amy and, uh,

349
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:18,652
取Emily的”Y”
the "Y" from Emily.

350
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,288
那合起来还是Amy啊
That's just Amy.

351
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,491
正是 看见我们配合的多好了吗?
Exactly. See how well we work together?

352
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:27,394
双盲实验里证明了
And in double-blind studies,

353
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:29,730
Placinex对于各种焦虑症
Placinex proved extremely effective in treating

354
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,332
都有超级好的疗效
all kinds of anxiety.

355
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,501
跟你说实话吧 真是太有意思了… 实验小哥
Actually, funny story… the boys in the lab

356
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:36,203
特别担心Placinex是不是能取得药监局认证
were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex;

357
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,439
然后他们吃了那个药 就一点都不担心了
they started taking it, stopped worrying.

358
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,442
知道了
Got it.

359
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,776
呃 你还有什么问题吗?
Uh, do you have any questions?

360
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:45,146
- 就一个  - 什么?
- Just one.  - Mm-hmm?

361
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:47,214
你让你老公假装病人
When you made your husband pretend to be a patient

362
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:51,752
给你探路的时候 你想什么呢?
so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?

363
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:56,023
我是说… 你有什么关于这种药的问题吗
I just… meant a question about the drug.

364
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:58,959
我知道你什么意思
Yeah, I know what you meant.

365
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:00,427
不过现在先不谈那个
Let's put that aside for a minute

366
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,097
咱们来说说你为什么嫁给了Leonard吧
and talk about why you married Leonard.

367
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,533
我也不想…
I don't wanna…

368
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,570
这么多年 这个男人被强势的妈
Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman

369
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:13,407
统治了生活的方方面面
who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years.

370
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,342
你觉不觉得
Do you think

371
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,844
他找你做老婆
he's perpetuating that relationship

372
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:19,880
是为了延续那样的关系?
by seeking out a partner like you?

373
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,652
说起来 我以前经常穿吊带背心
You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.

374
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:27,121
估计这个才是重点吧
That was a big selling point.

375
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,125
嘿 Sheldon 怎么啦?
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?

376
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:34,461
有好消息 你是一颗小行星啦
Good news. You're an asteroid.

377
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,834
呃… 我不太知道应该说什么了
Uh… please tell me what to say next.

378
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,636
我应该给你解释一下
Perhaps I should explain.

379
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,471
我和Koothrappali一起工作的时候
While working with Koothrappali,

380
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,808
发现了一颗小行星 然后我用你的名字给它命名了
we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.

381
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,910
哦
Oh.

382
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,012
Sheldon 人家好喜欢
Sheldon, thank you.

383
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,847
真是太浪漫啦
That's so romantic.

384
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,416
那Rajesh呢?
But what about Rajesh?

385
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:57,484
你选了名字他同意吗?
He was okay with you choosing the name?

386
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,220
这个嘛 我跟他协商了一下
Well, it took a little negotiating,

387
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,521
然后我把他说服了
but I wore him down.

388
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:02,022
所以呢 我们来命名小行星
Uh, we get the asteroid,

389
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,724
但是如果我们以后有了孩子
and if you and I have children,

390
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:07,261
他们都得叫Rajesh
they all have to be named Rajesh.

391
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,597
所有孩子吗?
All of them?

392
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:12,399
连女孩也是
Even the girls.

393
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:16,003
现在我知道我想说什么了
Okay, I think I know what to say now.

394
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:19,840
我们的卧室全都铺满了星球大战的玩具
How can I not sound like his mother

395
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,842
我怎么可能不像他妈妈一样说他?
when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys?

396
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,444
我是说 你肯定没在毛绒伍基人
I mean, have you ever had sex

397
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:26,213
瞪着你的时候啪啪啪过吧?
with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?

398
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:29,049
我可是七十年代上的大学 大家都不脱毛
I went to college in the '70s; it was a hairier time.

399
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:31,619
我觉得肯定有过
I'm gonna say yes.

400
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,088
总之 更像是他把我慢慢变成了他妈
You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother.

401
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,523
做医药代表之前 我是个演员
Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress.

402
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,158
我还干得不错呢
You know, I was pretty good.

403
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,694
你知道的 就是邻家女孩那种类型的 但是超性感哟
You know, girl-next-door type, but hot.

404
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,930
那种容易被上的
Doable.

405
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,198
诶
Hmm.

406
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,833
而且我还不仅是Leonard的妈
And not only am I Leonard's mother,

407
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,602
我们家还住着一个永远长不大的孩子叫Sheldon
but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.

408
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:51,839
哦 Leonard经常说起他
Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.

409
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,908
我还以为那是他自己想出来的呢
I wasn't sure if he was real.

410
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,311
我倒希望是 我要是用多了厕所手纸
Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get

411
00:16:57,313 --> 00:17:00,447
还得给他交罚款呢
when I use too much toilet paper.

412
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,051
天哪 你有好多烦心事啊
Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.

413
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,420
是啊
I do.

414
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:07,821
我觉得
You know,

415
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:08,889
Leonard说得对
Leonard's right.

416
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,758
跟你说说话确实挺有用的
Talking to you is really helping.

417
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,259
哦 我很高兴
Oh, I'm glad.

418
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:13,994
知道吗 吃点治焦虑症的药
You know, you might also benefit

419
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,363
也许对你也有好处
from a prescription for anxiety.

420
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,332
行啊 如果你觉得有帮助
Okay, if you think it'll help.

421
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,867
千万别给我开Placinex
Oh, just don't make it Placinex.

422
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,469
我可不想突然变成杀人狂魔
I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.

423
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,075
好想你啊
I miss you.

424
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,710
我也想你了呢
I miss you as well.

425
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,779
简直不敢相信我居然这么想Stuart
I can't believe I miss Stuart.

426
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:34,581
也许我只是怀念生活更简单的时候
I guess I just miss when life was simpler.

427
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,450
加油 Leonard! Leonard!
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

428
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,751
太棒啦 Leonard! Leonard！
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

429
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:40,921
记住了 姐妹们 是你自己决定自己的幸福
Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy,

430
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:43,524
不是你们没有感情的妈!
not your emotionally withholding mothers!

431
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,526
棒棒哒 Leonard! Leonard 棒棒哒!
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

432
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:48,762
Leonard 棒棒哒! 棒棒哒 Leonard! Leonard 棒棒哒!
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

433
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:07,192
真怀念就这样看着他们两个
I really miss this.
