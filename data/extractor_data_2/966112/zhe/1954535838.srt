1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,030
尽管得花点时间来解释
It took me a while to figure out

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,980
但这是了解你们巴尼叔叔的关键
but the key to understanding your Uncle Barney is this.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,400
你不爽时 抓都抓不住他
When times are hard, it's impossible to keep him around.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,970
比如当莉莉阿姨 和马修叔叔分手的时候
Like when your aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were broken up.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,990
聊什么呢
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,200
- 莉莉... - 我得走了
- Lily. - I got to go.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,270
你开心的时候 他就苍蝇一样赶的赶不走
But when times are good, it's impossible to get rid of him.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,250
伙计们干吗呢
What are you guys doing?

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,090
我们刚商量好 怎么给马修办单身汉派对
We just finished planning Marshall's bachelor party.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,070
讨论还没开始吧 我们来谈谈具体流程
Good, you haven't started yet. Let's talk logistics.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,670
莉莉有给你禁令?
Now, have you laid out ground rules with Lily?

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,230
什么地方能摸 什么地方不能摸或者被摸?
Where you are or aren't allowed to touch or be touched?

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,340
在泰德身上演示一下
Show me on Ted.

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,460
我们不打算要脱衣舞娘
Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking of skipping the strippers.

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,060
你们...要举行 没有脱衣舞的派对
You... you want to have a party without strippers.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,810
我不得不说 最糟糕的事情是
This was the worse thing I could have said.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,540
巴尼叔叔喜欢胡搞单身汉派对
You see, uncle Barney loved cooking up bachelor parties.

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,470
并且总是一模一样的胡搞
And it was always the same recipe.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,490
狭窄的旅馆房间
You start with a slightly cramped hotel suite.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,890
椅子围成一圈
Arrange the chairs in a circle...

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,460
老友团团而坐
Fill them with your closest friends.

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,720
温度直达90度 (注:这里是华氏温度 大致等于32℃)
Turn the heat up to about 90.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,220
吞云又吐雾
Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,220
接着  房间中央 舞女开始妖娆
And then, right in the middle of the room, you throw in a girl.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,990
但并非美女
But not a beautiful girl--

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,000
就算她曾是个美女 那也是在她两次怀孕
no, if this girl was ever beautiful, it was two kids,

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,510
三次纹身  一次吸毒之前
three tattoos and one pesky substance abuse problem ago.

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,330
你们当中谁是斯图尔特 (新郎)
Which one of you is Stuart?

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,150
不用了  我没打算要这样
Please, I really don't want to do this.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,860
闭嘴  小心别咬到舌头
Shut up, put in your mouth guard.

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,140
她接下来所做的 让新郎蒙羞
Then she proceeds to do things that demean the groom,

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,930
让她自己蒙羞 让整个人类为之蒙羞
herself and really, the entire human race.

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,220
真恶心
Disgusting.

34
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,190
太恐怖了
Ah, horrifying.

35
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,300
- 经典 - 拜托  不  不
- Classic. - Oh, please, please, no, no.

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,840
我可不想那样的事发生在我身上
I don't want anything like that happening to me.

37
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,660
斯途尔特至今 仍对那个晚上耿耿于怀
Stuart's still trying to forget that night.

38
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,300
这是我的派对 我不要脱衣舞娘
It's my bachelor party. We're not having strippers.

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,330
他还以为他是柳下惠
Oh, he thinks he has a sain it.

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,040
脱衣舞万岁
So, strippers it is!

41
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,730
现在  告诉我地点 我来打电话
Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going to be and I'll make some calls.

42
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,480
我能搞到7.5折
I think I can get the fourth one for free.

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,910
快速问答 假肢 能不能接受
Quick question. Prosthetic arm. Deal breaker?

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,860
- 巴尼... - 在你说不之前 想下 这可是有赠品的
- Barney, there is... - Before you say no, it has attachments.

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,080
我知道你是为马修的派对想点子
Look, I know you have some stuff planned for Marshall's bachelor party,

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,520
- 但他真的不想要脱衣舞 - 不  他想要
- but he really doesn't want strippers. - Yes, he does.

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,860
- 他跟我说他不要 - 他跟我说他要
- Uh, well, he told me he doesn't. - Uh, well, he told me he does.

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,670
- 什么时候 - 每时每刻
- When? - Every minute of every day

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,880
当他骨子里的兽性 挣破他道德约束的囚笼
as his inner animal thrashes against the cage of his own puritanical upbringing.

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,330
难道你们不喜欢裸女
Or do you guys not like naked girls.

58
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,350
当然喜欢
Um, we love naked girls.

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,820
她们可是世上最棒的
They're one of the best things in the world.

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,120
依次为...裸女  民主
It goes... naked girls, democracy,

61
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,170
永不低头中 猴子给那家伙竖中指
the scene in Every Which Way But Loose where the monkey gives a guy the finger.

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,590
- 我们只是不想要你找来的舞娘 - 什么?难道我找来的姑娘不够辣?
- We just don't like your naked girls. - What, my girls aren't hot enough?

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,010
斯图尔特派对上 的那个舞娘只有15岁
I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at Stuart's bachelor party was a 15.

64
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,670
- 她15岁? - 不  15点  在21点中的点数
- She was 15? - No, a 15. Like in blackjack.

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,660
我在犹豫到底要不要出手
As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?

66
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,730
- 真的 - 太好了
- Exactly. - Nice.

67
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,090
这对马修很重要 答应我  不搞脱衣舞
This is important to Marshall. So, promise me, no strippers.

68
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,300
好吧  我保证
All right, I promise.

69
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,510
- 我很认真 - 我也很认真  不会有脱衣舞
- I'm serious. - So am I. No strippers.

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,950
再说一次  别眨眼睛
Now say it without winking.

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,090
不会有脱衣舞
No strippers.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,320
- 你眨眼了 - 不  我没有
- You just winked. - No I didn't.

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,040
我们开着一辆 租来的凯迪拉克然后出发
So, when the day arrived, we all climbed into a rented Escalade and set out.

74
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,180
现在的单身汉派对通常构成如下
Now, every bachelor party is usually made up of the same stock characters.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
新郎
You've got the groom...

76
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,160
伴郎
the best man...

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,740
- 只会陈词滥调的家伙 - 死囚漫步(电影片名)
- the guy who speaks only in clichs... - Dead man walking!

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
在派对开始便消失
...the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night

79
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,630
直到结束才出现的家伙
and doesn't show up again until the end.

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,770
去旅馆前先玩玩21点怎么样
All right, who's up for a little blackjack before we check in.

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,060
不...不...不...
- No, no, no. - None for me.

82
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,210
到时候旅馆见了
See you guys back at the room, then.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,690
当然  还有巴尼
And, of course, well... Barney.

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,400
- 每个单身汉派对都有一个巴尼这样的人 - 这是什么
Every bachelor party has a Barney. Oh, what's this?

85
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,000
这车还有DVD?这么说...
This car has a DVD player? You mean,

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,260
我们可以一路上看看A片了
we could have been watching these pornos the whole time?

87
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,340
这是高清格式的
- Yeah. - This one's in HD.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,060
这是高清+高清的
This one's in H-double-D. Oh!

89
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,960
同一个晚上 莉莉阿姨也有一个单身女子派对
That same night, aunt Lily was having a wedding shower.

90
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,920
罗宾手持礼物出场
And Robin showed up gift in hand.

91
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,700
关于这礼物还有个有趣的故事
Funny story about that gift.

92
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,600
我为莉莉准备的礼物 看看怎么样
Hey, Barney, check out what I got Lily for her shower.

93
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,880
很是性感火辣  你行吗
It's kind of racy. Think you can handle it?

94
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,580
十倍于此我都受得了 没问题
Uh, I've been in a ten-way. So, yeah.

95
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,120
是透明装
- It's kind of see-through. - Whoa, ho ho!

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,310
你开玩笑吧 你知道这个什么年代最适合?
You weren't kidding! You know when you should give that to her?

97
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,150
1850年
1850.

98
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,800
这是她告别单身的派对
Robin, it's her bridal shower!

99
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,780
她所有的朋友都会出席 喝酒狂欢
All her friends are gonna be there, they're going to be drinking.

100
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,300
你该送她一份大胆的 过火的礼物
You need to get her something daring, something outrageous.

101
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,560
那你觉得我该送她什么
Well, what do you think I should get her?

102
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,570
第八大道上有一家店专门卖...
There's a store on Eighth Avenue that specializes in--

103
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,440
要怎么说呢
how to put this delicately?--

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,010
供人寻欢作乐的人造阳具 装电池的...
uh, battery-powered, adult- recreational fake penises.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,020
于是罗宾阿姨来到 第八大道的那家店里
And so Aunt Robin went to a store on Eighth Avenue,

106
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,180
买了一个装电池的 供人寻欢作乐的...
and a battery-powered, adult-recreational...

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,030
跟你们说这个不大合适 我们快进...
Well, it was something inappropriate. And we're back in.

108
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,860
罗宾

113
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,560
她们筹办了今天晚上的派对
They put this whole party together.

114
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,700
跟我想象中有些不一样 但很温馨
It's different from what I expected, but lovely.

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,920
真的很温馨
Lovely.

116
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,370
这儿居然还有小孩!
And oh, look, there are little kids here!

117
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,450
是我的表妹
Yeah, my cousins.

118
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,780
我忘了点东西 在别的地方了  所以我得...
Listen, I, uh, I forgot something somewhere so I'm going to just go...

119
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,780
罗宾  这是我妈妈杰尼斯
Robin, this is my mom, Janice.

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,900
真高兴今天终于可以见到你
Oh, honey. I'm so glad to finally meet you.

121
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,820
我也是  久闻您的大名
Me too. I, I've heard so much about you.

122
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,790
我也一直听说你 让我帮你拿礼物吧
Me, too. Oh, here. Let me take your gift.

123
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,090
让我猜猜是什么 一个迷你食品加工机?
Can I guess what it is? Is it a, a, a mini food processor?

124
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,730
- 不 - 不是吗?
- No. - No? Oh.

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,590
给我点提示吧  是什么颜色的?
Oh, give me a hint. What color is it?

126
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,650
黑色
Black.

127
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,980
我想我得等到 礼物拆开才知道是什么了
Well, I guess I'm just going to have to wait and see!

128
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,270
罗宾
- Oh, great. - Robin...

129
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,180
这是我堂妹玛格丽特
This is my Cousin Margaret.

130
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,450
终于有跟我们一样年纪的了
Oh, finally, someone our own age!

131
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,150
我应该介绍你为玛格丽特堂妹 还是玛格丽特修女?
Wait, do I introduce you as "Cousin Margaret" or "Sister Margaret?"

132
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,050
我要到下个月才正式成为修女
Well, I'm not officially confirmed as a nun until next month

133
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,560
我也不想催那位大人物
and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy,

134
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,360
所以现在还是叫"表妹"好了
 so let's stick with "Cousin" for now.

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,650
连上帝都在  太好了
God's watching. Excellent!

136
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
他们拍这部片子可以花了大钱了
Man, they spent a lot of money on this porno.

137
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,210
摩根・弗里曼? 每部电影都看得到这老兄
Whoa-- Morgan Freeman? Man, that guy's in everything.

138
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,630
我拿错碟了 这是《彗星撞地球》
Aw, man, I grabbed the wrong Deep Impact!

139
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,320
别换碟  这电影不错
No, leave it in, it's a good movie.

140
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,280
可是伙计 这部电影没有做爱
But, dude, there's no sex in it.

141
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,700
就像婚姻  不是吗
Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?

142
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,090
试试这个 别问我从哪弄的
Oh, oh, hey, check this out! Don't ask how,

143
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,030
但我给大家搞到5根洛可比亚诺牌
but I procured for us five loco-bueno,

144
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,660
手工卷制 绝对违法的古巴雪茄
hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans.

145
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,830
我不是开玩笑 抽这玩意儿都能让你蹲大狱
Seriously, you could go to jail for smoking these things.

146
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,420
婚姻就像监狱  对不?
Marriage is like jail! Right, fellas?!

147
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,380
但在监狱  你至少还能做爱
But at least in jail, you get to have sex!

148
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,980
但在抵达A.C前 我们还不能享用这些宝贝
But we're not lighting these babies up, till we get to the A.C.

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,130
A.C?
A.C.?

150
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,920
大西洋城 跟上我们的思路 布莱德
Um, Atlantic City. Try to keep up, Brad.

151
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,980
我们不是去大西洋城
We're not going to Atlantic City.

152
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,050
等等  布莱德
Just a second, Brad.

153
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,769
- Hi. - Hi.

154
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,720
我们仍然是去大西洋城  是吧?
We're still going to Atlantic City, right?

155
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,250
我没告诉你吗  计划变了 我们去福克斯伍德
Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we switched it. We're going to Foxwoods.

156
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,830
福克斯伍德?
Foxwoods?

157
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,170
但我已经让脱衣舞娘 在旅馆里等着了
But I've got an ipperstray waiting in tlanticaay itycay.

158
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,960
他妈的去福克斯伍德干什么
What the heck's in Foxwoods?

159
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,180
我们有5张波平斯基跟萨拉扎 重赛的第三排座位票
Well, we've got five third row seats to the Popinski-Salazar rematch.

160
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,720
他们留了一张赌桌给我们
They've set aside our very own craps table,

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,730
我还在Connelly's订了一个包厢
and I reserved a private room for us at Connelly's,

162
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,390
在那里我们将尽情 享用重达102盎司的牛排
where the five of us are going to be sharing a 102-ounce steak

163
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,850
牛排是我在网上订的
from a cow that I picked out on the Internet.

164
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,530
很好  今晚就被你糟蹋了
- Yeah. - Great. The night's ruined.

165
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,530
抱歉  巴尼 这只是个善良的谎言
Sorry, Barney. It was an honest mistake.

166
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,770
完美的夜晚正等着我们
This is going to be great!

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,030
暴吃牛排  拳击 大把的赌博烧钱
Meat, violence, throwing money down the toilet.

168
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,270
烧美元得一分  烧其他货币不得分
America-- one; every other country-- zero.

169
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,330
伙计们  谢谢
- Thanks, guys. - Yeah.

170
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,530
你还好吗  巴尼
 You okay, Barney? 

171
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,510
你想我说什么 泰德  你赢了
What can I say, Ted? You won.

172
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:25,533
Hi.

173
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,650
你是个可悲又可怜的输家
You one... sad, pathetic loser.

174
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,300
跟宝贝打个招呼吧
Boys, say hello to Treasure.

175
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,050
嗨 宝贝
Hi, Treasure.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,770
- 真不敢相信你居然这么做了 - 我应该的
- I can't believe that you did this. - I had to.

177
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,140
- 我是你的伴郎 - 泰德才是我伴郎
- I'm your best man. - Ted's my best man.

178
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,100
你做了决定  这很好
You've yet to make a decision and that's fine.

179
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,000
但作为你的未来伴郎 我有义务确保你参加在单身汉派对
But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job to make sure at your bachelor party

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,840
欣赏女郎在怀特斯奈克的 音乐声中边脱边舞
you see a woman take her clothes off while dancing to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again."

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,110
好吧  随便你  但快点结束好吗
All right, fine, but... let's make it fast, all right.

182
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,860
比赛一个小时后开始 我们可不想错过
The fight starts in an hour we don't want to miss it.

183
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,390
只是个姑娘脱衣服 这要得了多少时间
It's a girl taking her clothes off. How long can it take?

184
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
没你想的那么简单
It's a bit more complicated than that.

185
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,410
我要两个接地插座 一个干净的大壶装满热水
I need two grounded sockets, a large sterile pot filled with hot water

186
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,610
并且你们都得签署这个证书
and you all need to sign these releases.

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,780
一个打蛋器 谢谢西尔维亚姨妈
An egg beater! Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!

188
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,560
还是无绳的  我很喜欢
I love that it's cordless.

189
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,320
至少我的也不需要电线
Well, at least I got that part right.

190
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,110
你们的礼物都太有创意了
All of these gifts are so thoughtful.

191
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,530
莉莉?
Lily?

192
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,060
我要你现在看着我  听我的心声
I need you to look at me right now and read my mind.

193
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,260
- 我的上帝  你听见了 - 是的
- Oh, my God! You're hearing me! - Yeah!

194
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,060
抱歉派对有点无聊  你怎么了
Sorry this party's so boring. What's up?

195
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,430
不要打开我的礼物
Do not open my gift. 

196
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,440
看见我的动作了吗
See what I'm doing here?

197
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,120
我先看看礼物  再回头看你
I'm looking over at the gift, then back at you,

198
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,990
接着摇头  "不要"
and I'm shaking my head, "no."

199
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,510
礼物  你...不要?
Gift. You. No.

200
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,340
懂了吗?
Are you getting that?

201
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,340
完全了解
 I totally got it.

202
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,710
给你这个
Here you go.

203
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,390
莉莉说你正是每月的那几天
Lily said it was your time of the month.

204
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,520
不客气
You're welcome.

205
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,520
你要做什么
What are you doing?

206
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,550
只是...把礼物重新摆放一下 看上去有些摇摇欲坠
Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts. The pile looked a bit precarious. So...

207
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,810
别担心  我会看着的
Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,010
那好  你来吧
Great. You do that.

209
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,440
你他妈一定会是个好修女的
You're gonna make a damn good nun.

210
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,850
此后数年  每当罗宾讲到这件事
As many times as Robin told this story over the years,

211
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,320
她都无法合理的 解释她接下来的行为
she would never quite be able to explain the logic of her next move.

212
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,500
这是脱衣秀还是Kiss组合的演唱会啊
Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?

213
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,540
嘘  她正要开始呢
Shh! She's starting.

214
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,290
请关掉手机传呼机 释放你们内心的狂野激情吧
Please turn off your cell phones, pagers and sense of shame.

215
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,570
帅哥们  舒服的躺着 尽情享受吧
All right, boys. Lie back, get comfortable, and enjoy the show.

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,860
我不能向你们描述演出的具体内容
Of course there's no way I'm telling you about her show.

217
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,050
所以跳过这一小段
- So, let's skip ahead a little. - Ow!

218
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,160
我的天  你还好吗
Oh my God, are you all right?

219
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,000
不  我不好 你这蠢货  我脚折了!
No, I am not all right, you idiot. My ankle is broken!

220
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,180
送我去医院
Take me to the hospital! 

221
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,330
可我们还有比赛的门票
Um, actually, we have tickets.

222
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,900
这一切全拜你所赐
You know what? Thanks a lot, Barney.

223
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,290
她一早就说过
She told you at the beginning of the show

224
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,630
当她在弹力球上的时候 别碰喷雾机
not to use the smoke machine when she's on the hippity hop.

225
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,340
现在我将不得不 在医院继续我的单身派对
Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of my bachelor party in a hospital.

226
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,090
对了 我们去看她的X光片
Well, hey, maybe we'll get to see her X-rays.

227
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,990
终极脱衣秀
The ultimate strip show.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,810
- X片 不如说是三X片 - 给我闭嘴
- X-rays. More like triple X-rays. - Just stop.

229
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,510
哪边是医院出口?
Which exit is the hospital?

230
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,420
如果她没出事多少
What if she doesn't make it to the hospital?

231
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,030
巴尼  冷静
Barney, please calm down.

232
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,450
也许我们该把她丢进沙漠
Maybe we should just take her to the desert,

233
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,320
活埋  然后彻底撇清这件事
bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing!

234
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,940
帅哥  你怎么了
Dude, what is the matter with you?

235
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,090
我只是想让马修知道 作为他的伴郎...
I'm just trying to illustrate to Marshall that as his best man...

236
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,820
你不是我的伴郎
You're not my best man. 

237
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,980
作为他的伴郎
As his best man,

238
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,830
我会帮他把妓女活埋在沙漠里
I would help him bury a hooker in the desert.

239
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,730
我不是妓女
I'm not a hooker. 

240
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,740
你不是我的伴郎
And you're not my best man.

241
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,390
你毁了我的派对
You've ruined my bachelor party.

242
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,340
实在搞不懂 当我拒绝你的提议时
I don't know why you wouldn't just 

243
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
你怎么就不听从我呢
listen to me when I said I didn't want this.

244
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,090
比赛十分钟前开始了 也许我们该听听广播
Well, the fight started ten minutes ago. Maybe-maybe we should listen.

245
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,030
多么精彩的比赛啊
Oh, Doctor, what a fight!

246
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,620
最后这一击将在 以后为人们所津津乐道
That knockout will be talked about for years to come!

247
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,470
今晚在场的所有人
Anyone lucky enough to be in the arena tonight

248
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,240
将有幸成为拳坛历史的见证者
just witnessed boxing history in the making!

249
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,420
太感谢你了  玛格丽特
Thank you so much, Margaret. 

250
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,430
真不敢相信这个 十字架是你亲手刻的
I can't believe you carved that crucifix yourself.

251
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,010
你太有才了
So talented.

252
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,063
Didn't think you could carve.

253
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,500
给你
For you. Oh.

254
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,220
这是...
 And this one's from...

255
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,950
- 路易斯奶奶的礼物 - 亲爱的  等等
- Grandma Lois. - Oh. No, wait, darling.

256
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,940
在你打开它之前  我有话要说
Before you open this, I-I want to say a few words.

257
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,680
我得事先声明
Okay, something you need to know.

258
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,420
路易斯奶奶以为这是 她送给她孙女的古董缝纫机
Grandma Lois thought she was giving her granddaughter an antique sewing machine.

259
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,660
继续我们的故事
And we're back in.

260
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,240
这个手控的小玩意 在我们家世代相传
Honey, this handy little device has been in our family for generations.

261
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,120
我用过  你曾祖母用过
I used it, your great grandmother used it.

262
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,660
太祖母没用过这个 但她有一个差不多的东西
Now, her mother didn't use this one, but she used one just like it.

263
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,370
话说回来  它们都是木制品
Of course, back then, they were made out of wood.

264
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,370
我想在那之前 人们只能靠自己的双手来解决
And, uh, I guess before that, you just had to do it by hand.

265
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,150
请把酒递o我一下
Would you pass the wine, please? 

266
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,120
不...
No.

267
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,870
马修
Hey, Marshall,

268
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,280
既然你来这了 你可以去停尸房
while we're here, you may as well go down to the morgue and

269
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,350
钻进停尸的柜子 因为婚姻就是这样
climb into a drawer, 'cause that's what marriage is like.

270
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,850
你们同意吗
Can I get an amen?

271
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,400
- 斯图尔特  你跟你老婆还好吧? - 不好
- Is everything all right at home, Stuart? - No.

272
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,650
腿断了
It's broken.

273
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,210
该死  这真糟糕 我不能丢掉这份工作
Oh, damn it, this is bad. I really can't lose this job.

274
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,520
我女儿就要开学了 可我家那口子...
My daughters are about to start school, and my fianc? well...

275
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,650
自打从伊拉克回来 他就只知道喝酒
ever since he got back from Iraq, pretty much all he does is drink.

276
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,220
我想过要离开他  但...
I think about leaving him, but...

277
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,410
我不想女儿们像我一样 在没有父亲的环境长大
I don't want my girls growing up without a dad like I did.

278
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,960
我不愿让她们有那样的经历
I don't want them to know what that's like.

279
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,480
- 该表演了? - 你有毛病?
- So, show time? - What is the matter with you?

280
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,070
她腿断了
Her ankle's broken.

281
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,060
我非常清楚 她通常以就座或仰卧的姿势
I know for a fact that the second half of her act

282
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,690
进行下半段的表演
takes place largely in a seated or supine position.

283
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,950
是的
Oh, that's true.

284
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,260
宝贝  别为演出发愁
Treasure, please, don't worry about the show.

285
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,990
我们会很内疚
Uh, we'd feel bad.

286
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,030
你什么意思
What does that mean?

287
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,050
我是说  你又不是妓女
No. We just mean, uh, you're off the hook.

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,380
你不是非得这么干
You don't have to do it.

289
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,230
我不是非得这么干? 你算什么东西
I don't have to do it? Well, guess what?

290
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,960
我知道我该干什么 我做这行是因为我擅长
I know I don't have to do it. I do it because I am good at it.

291
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,790
我不需要你的同情怜悯
Look, I don't need your pity.

292
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,890
我只是想让你欣赏到精彩的表演 因为你要结婚了!
All I want to do is give you a great show because you're getting married!

293
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,980
这是很过分的要求吗 这让你很不便吗
Is that so much to ask? Is that such a major inconvenience?!

294
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,730
这是个错误
Oh, that is wrong.

295
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,590
错得太离谱了
Oh, that's just so wrong.

296
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,420
医生有嘱咐她保持高抬腿
Well, the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated.

297
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,820
我还是个小姑娘的时候
When I was a girl, 

298
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,990
我母亲就教我和我妹妹如何使用它
my mother taught me and my sister to use it.

299
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,250
我们常常比赛看谁做得更快
We used to have contests to see who could finish faster.

300
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,100
全家人都围在一起看 相当激动人心
It was so exciting. The whole family would gather around to watch.

301
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,820
而我新婚的时候
And when I was a new bride, 

302
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,040
多亏了它  我才在 你们祖父远征朝鲜的
this is what kept me buzy

303
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,800
那些漫漫长夜里不那么寂寞难耐
all those long nights when your grandfather was in Korea.

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,030
说到你们祖父
And speaking of your grandfather,

305
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,540
尽管我不觉得他会向谁承认  但...
though I don't think he'd care to admit this to any of his army buddies, but...

306
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,030
每隔一阵他就会拿它出来...
he'd have a go at it every once in a while.

307
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,310
他喜欢这个
And he enjoyed it.

308
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,590
打开看看  亲爱的
Oh, open it up, sweetie.

309
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,950
愿它给你欢愉 就像它曾带给我的
May this give for you as much joy as it's brought me.

310
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,620
奶奶...
Grandma, um...

311
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,502
Wow.

312
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,130
拿出来啊  亲爱的 我想教你怎么用
Well, take it out, honey. I want to show you how to use it.

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,060
不  不  别拿出来
Okay, no, no! Don't take it out.

314
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,000
莉莉  那不是你奶奶的礼物 是我的
Lily, that's not your grandma's gift. It's mine.

315
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,190
我很慌张  我很尴尬 所以我偷换了礼物上的卡片
I panicked, and I switched the cards because I was embarrassed.

316
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,750
这到底是什么
Well, what is it?

317
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,950
这跟《欲望都市》里 米兰达送夏洛特的一样
It's just like the one Miranda gave to Charlotte on Sex and the City.

318
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,720
我喜欢那个剧 我一直看TBS的《欲望都市》
Oh, I love that show. I always watch it on TBS.

319
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,350
确实值得一看  你就是莎曼莎
Oh, you would. You're such a Samantha!

320
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,860
我是凯利  而你是莎曼莎
Oh, I'm a Carrie! You're a Samantha!

321
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,290
然后那一晚变成了另一种的不爽
And then the night became a whole new kind of uncomfortable.

322
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,100
- 我该上哪儿去买这个呢 - 妈
- So where do I get one of these? - Mom!

323
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,830
伙计  烂透了的表演  是吧
Man, what a show, huh?

324
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,690
瞧她那恶心的姿势 整个儿都粘在你身上
She did some disgusting stuff. Really sticks with you.

325
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,870
我不吃了
I may be done eating.

326
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,270
我也是
Me, too.

327
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,350
我是说永远
I mean, like, forever.

328
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,900
我也是
Me, too.

329
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,730
我想我老婆
I miss my wife.

330
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,020
吃完饭大家就聊聊 最喜欢哪部分的表演
Hey, let's go around the table and say what our favorite part was.

331
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,430
我喜欢有打字机的那一段
Mine was that thing with the typewriter.

332
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,760
尽管她有很多拼写错误 但这不影响...
I mean, she made some spelling mistakes, but still.

333
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,330
你们这些家伙 都叫  "巴尼  把烟灭掉"
Ooh, and you guys were all, "Barney, put out the cigar!

334
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,850
"这是无烟室" 我说  "不  这可是古巴烟草"
It's a non-smoking room!" And I was all, "Hell, no, this is a Cuban!"

335
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,220
当然  我最后还是把烟灭了
Of course, eventually, I did put it out.

336
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,280
我灭了吗
Did I put it out?

337
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,040
我灭了
I put it out.

338
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,400
我灭了吗
Did I put it out?

339
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,890
我灭了
I put it out.

340
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,720
我灭了吗
Did I put it out?

341
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,930
火灾并不严重
It was a small fire, 

342
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,940
还不至于让整个旅馆的人被疏散
not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel,

343
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,980
但却足够糟糕到让我们被赶出去
but definitely big enough to get us kicked out,

344
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,900
因此提前结束马修的单身汉派对
and bring Marshall's bachelor party to an early end.

345
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,400
那是...?
Is that...?

346
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,420
正是
It is.

347
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
嗨  伙计们
Hey, guys.

348
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
战况如何
How was the fight?

349
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,970
你们在这儿干?单身汉派对?
Hey, what are you guys doing here? What happened to the bachelor party?

350
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,410
我们错过了拳击比赛 晚饭也被毁了
We missed the fight, dinner was ruined,

351
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,820
我们在医院呆了半个晚上 并且被旅馆赶了出来
we spent half the night in the hospital,and got kicked out of the hotel.

352
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,170
你觉得发生什么了
What do you think happened? 

353
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,270
- 巴尼 - 巴尼
- Barney. Barney.

354
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,300
我只是想做个称职的伴郎
Hey, I was just trying to be a good best man.

355
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,310
你知道怎样才是称职的伴郎?
You know what a best man does, Barney? 

356
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,990
他得紧密团结在 以新郎为核心的周围
He does what the groom wants.

357
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,030
可你都只是按照 你的意愿做你想做的
But all you ever think about is what you want, what's best for you.

358
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,950
伴郎?
Best man?

359
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,250
我现在都不确定是否要请你参加我的婚礼
I'm not even sure I'm inviting you to the wedding at this point.

360
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,440
你不会吧
You don't mean that.

361
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,400
我干吗要请你 你甚至都不希望我们结婚
Why should I invite you? You don't even want us to get married.

362
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
巴尼不是那样的人
That's not true.

363
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,440
莉莉  别说了
Lily, don't.

364
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,410
什么
What?

365
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,600
很抱歉  巴尼
I'm sorry, Barney.

366
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,470
那是去年夏天我们分手时候的事
It happened last summer when we were broken up.

367
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,640
伙计们  聊什么呢
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

368
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,770
- 莉莉... - 我得走了
- Lily. - Ah, I got to go.

369
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,290
纽华克机场  谢谢
Newark Airport, please.

370
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,540
巴尼  你怎么来了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Barney, what are you doing here?

371
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,280
难以置信真的是你 进来  快请坐...
I can't believe it's really you. Come in, have a seat.

372
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,080
要喝茶吗  我知道公寓很小
Do you want some tea? I know the apartment's small,

373
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,050
但对我已经足够了 给你看看我的画
but I don't need much space. Let me show you some of my paintings.

374
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,140
是我至今为止最好的作品
I think it's some of my best work ever.

375
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,230
如果你要说这些那就闭嘴吧
 Just stop it.

376
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,080
莉莉  你得回家 你跟马修心心相印
Lily, you have to come home. You and Marshall belong together.

377
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,850
你们俩
The two of you

378
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,430
是天作之合而许多人 却有缘无份  只能抱憾终身
have something that most people search their whole lives for and never find.

379
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,020
我知道你爱他 如果你知道 他现在是怎样的颓废萎靡
I know you love him, and if you knew what he was going through right now,

380
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,360
你绝对在这儿呆不下去
you wouldn't be here for one more second.

381
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,560
我给你买了回去的机票
I bought you a ticket home.

382
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,100
马修是我认识的最好的人
Marshall is one of the best people I know,

383
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,250
迟早别人也会发现这点
and it won't be long until someone else realizes that,

384
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,860
那时你就会永远失去他了
and you'll lose him forever.

385
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,800
只是假设  我都难以接受
I can't stand the thought of that happening,

386
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,530
可我也不能总守在他身边 把觊觎他的小妞都拐走
and I cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever.

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,520
千万  千万别告诉 别人我来过  我会抵死否认
Never, ever tell anyone I was here. I will deny it tooth and nail.

388
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,030
我从没来过
This trip never happened.

389
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,480
如果你在登机前 有三个小时空闲  你要怎么打发?
Hey, if you had three hours to kill before your flight, what would you do--

390
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,620
是逛监狱岛?还是渔人码头? (注:都是旧金山的旅游景点)
Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?

391
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,320
这是真的吗
You really did that?

392
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,230
我认为巴尼是你真正的好朋友
Marshall, I think Barney's your best man.

393
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:26,812
Yeah.

394
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,060
是  他是的
Yes, he is.

395
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,540
知道了吧  莉莉 这就是为什么我不...
See, Lily? This is why I didn't...

396
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,290
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Really? - Really.

397
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,420
真...
Real...

398
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,440
瞧瞧你那表情啊  你输了
In your face, loser!

399
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,050
别激动  泰德 也仍然是我的伴郎
Take it easy, all right. Ted's still my best man, too.

400
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,860
你们俩都是伴郎
You guys are co-best men.

401
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,150
是的  我们都是伴郎
Right. Yes, we're both best man.

402
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,130
不  正确的说  你们
No, um, seriously. You guys are co-best men.

403
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,510
当然
Of course.

404
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,030
真不敢相信你送我这个
I can't believe you got me this.

405
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,170
我只是想开个玩笑 如果你不喜欢我可以拿去退
Oh, I only did it as a joke. I can return it for you you want.

406
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,630
不 不 不用了 拿去退太麻烦了
Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have to go all the way back down there.

407
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,850
我可以把它放一边
I'll, I'll just throw it away.

408
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,860
这样的话
Well, I mean,

409
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,340
如果你要把它放一边 还不如让我拿走
if you were going to throw it away, maybe I'll take it

410
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,900
下次谁再请我参加单身聚会 我就不用买了
in case I get invited to another wedding shower.

411
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,950
这可是让人瞠目结舌的礼物
 It's a great gag gift.

412
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,310
是  这东西很有意思
Yeah, it's really funny.

413
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,930
你猜谁会被它吓得最厉害
You know who would get a kick out of it?

414
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,920
马修
Marshall.

415
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,910
所以  也许我该把它留着
So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.

416
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,670
要是马修知道我送这个给你 我会很难为情的
I would be embarrassed if Marshall found out that I bought it for you,

417
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,190
- 所以我最好拿走 - 罗宾  给我
- so I'd better just take it. - Robin, leave it.
