<font color="cyan">You don't deserve to be with anyone,</font>

153
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,960
<font color="cyan">because you don't treat people</font>
<font color="cyan">well enough.</font>

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,920
<font color="cyan">I was at the wedding.</font>

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,800
<font color="cyan">I was at the back.</font>
<font color="green">Sorry. Um...</font>

161
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
<font color="green">Why are you here?</font>

162
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,760
<font color="white">It was at this point</font>
<font color="white">I realised that Bonnie probably</font>
<font color="white">didn't have a sister.</font>
