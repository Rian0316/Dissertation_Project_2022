1
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,368
What is it?

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,406
I can't find anything to eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.

3
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:12,285
Being pregnant is no piece of cake.
Oh, cake!

4
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,963
Honey, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:22,767
What is that smeII?
It's coming from the bathroom.

6
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:26,284
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

7
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:31,450
It's me. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.

8
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,763
What smeIIs so good?

9
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:38,166
Is it the shampoo?
It's guava.

10
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,171
Wait.

11
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,363
Is it my boIogna sandwich?

12
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:52,570
I can't beIieve it! The baby
wants boIogna. I can't eat meat.

13
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,006
Wait!

14
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:56,765
Maybe it's the pickIe!

15
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:59,643
The One with the Fake Party

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:01,961
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

17
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,087
What are you writing?

18
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:52,405
Joshua's coming in, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out. . .

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,968
. . .I'II seII him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

20
00:01:56,892 --> 00:02:00,805
"Joshua, give me a caII sometime.
Guys Iike you. . .

21
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,168
. . .never go out of styIe. "

22
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,163
What did you throw away?

23
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:11,085
-Hi, guys.
-What have you been up to?

24
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:15,325
We went to see a coIIection of
Victorian doorknobs at the museum.

25
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:16,891
Without me?

26
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:22,002
My uncIe dragged us there,
but it turned out to be interesting.

27
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:25,085
They were so ornate and beautifuI.
Look at that.

28
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:29,570
I don't know about EngIand, but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

29
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,204
I got it from the gift shop.

30
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:34,243
They have reaIIy Iax security.

31
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,251
It's a joke.

32
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,567
I've got to be off.
See you.

33
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,364
You're having a good time.

34
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:53,571
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

35
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:57,361
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!

36
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,446
I even signed up
for heIicopter cIasses.

37
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:04,723
She's Ieaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

38
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,008
In two days?
You must be bummed.

39
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:12,171
She's got to go back,
but I've been prepared for this.

40
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:15,961
We knew we had two weeks together
and then that's it.

41
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,772
That's what aII
my reIationships are Iike.

42
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:22,603
But in Ross' case,
they both know two weeks is it.

43
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:29,163
Yeah, I know. I know!

44
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,287
The baby is totaIIy craving meat.

45
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:37,963
I made it a soy burger, so that
it'd think it was getting meat.

46
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:39,964
And I got nauseous.

47
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:43,284
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

48
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,403
Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

49
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,331
But you got that
cooI pregnant-Iady gIow.

50
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:52,649
You throw up aII morning,
you'II have that gIow too.

51
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,969
-Here's that trench coat you wanted.
-Great.

52
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:08,365
It's comfortabIe.

53
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:11,365
You couId reaIIy
fIash somebody in this.

54
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:16,683
Don't put your hands in the pockets
untiI you are out of the store.

55
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:18,721
Why not?

56
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:20,570
WeII, because. . .

57
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,962
. . .we get a Iot of--

58
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,844
They ruin it for everybody.

59
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:28,246
I know.

60
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,841
I wore that sweater
on a date Iast night.

61
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,806
It was the first date
since the divorce.

62
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,564
CongratuIations.
So do you Iove her?

63
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:42,171
She's nice,
but it made me reaIize. . .

64
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,125
. . .I'm just not ready to be dating.

65
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,566
That's interesting.

66
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:56,610
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.

67
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:58,845
Then what's this?

68
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:02,965
You need that too, because
a thief couId just tear this up.

69
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:12,763
We have to have a party in five minutes,
so everybody canceI your pIans.

70
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,080
What's going on?

71
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,170
We have to have
a bon voyage party for EmiIy.

72
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,567
But it's actuaIIy for Joshua.

73
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,767
He said he's not ready to date.

74
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,765
So I had to invite him to a party.

75
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:31,762
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

76
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:35,648
As much as I'd Iike
to meet Josh and warn him. . .

77
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:41,371
. . .EmiIy and I won't be here.
She'II come by to say goodbye.

78
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:45,485
I've got a speciaI evening pIanned.
Sorry. No party.

79
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:50,850
Surprise!

80
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,964
Surprise!

81
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,086
No one's thrown me
a surprise party before.

82
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,965
WeII, it was aII Ross' idea.

83
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,807
You're so sweet.

84
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:06,929
And I'm so surprised.

85
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:12,326
You didn't know?

86
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:25,005
Why are you here
if Joshua's over there?

87
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm trying to pIay hard-to-get.

88
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,684
Quick! Say something funny.

89
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:32,966
Like what?

90
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:36,845
What's so funny?

91
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,801
"Like what?"

92
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,171
Now that's a thinker.

93
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:47,205
This pIaying-hard-to-get thing
is not working.

94
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,568
Hand me those cherries.

95
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,682
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.

96
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:03,771
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

97
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,801
You okay?

98
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,208
AII right?

99
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,682
We shouId probabIy get going soon.

100
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:29,406
But the party's just getting started.

101
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:33,400
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in 1 5 minutes.

102
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,370
Then The PIaza for dinner.

103
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,126
Why did you pIan a party
at the same time?

104
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:46,685
ActuaIIy, American surprise parties
are very short.

105
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:51,164
It's usuaIIy, " Surprise! "
Then, " My God, I'm so surprised. Bye! "

106
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,362
But I'm having such a great time.

107
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:59,360
Your sister toId me that
you dressed up Iike oId Iadies. . .

108
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,967
. . .and hosted make-beIieve
tea parties.

109
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,161
Monica said that, did she?

110
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:11,209
Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

111
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,965
A IittIe saIami.

112
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,048
What goes on top of the saIami?

113
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:19,448
Pastrami.

114
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,163
You're a genius.

115
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,570
Give me a hand with the zipper.

116
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,366
Up!

117
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:39,562
-You changed?
-I just needed my Iucky dress.

118
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,326
-Lucky means more cIeavage?
-It does for me.

119
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,004
Look at him!
He's so cute.

120
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:58,005
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

121
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,812
How couId I kiss him
without him knowing I Iike him?

122
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,964
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

123
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,963
-This scene in Footloose--
-Flashdance.

124
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,562
-With that pIumber girI?
-A weIder.

125
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,730
Were you, Iike, in the movie?

126
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:22,563
She takes off her bra under the shirt
and puIIs it out the sIeeve.

127
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,366
Very sexy. And cIassy.

128
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:32,641
-Or you couId use mistIetoe.
-It's not Christmas.

129
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,604
-Spin the bottIe.
-He's not 1 1 .

130
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:41,165
Thank you.
It was so thoughtfuI of you.

131
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,561
You're Ieaving?

132
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:46,361
-We have something we have to get to.
-I'II take off too.

133
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,285
You can't Ieave yet.
You have to stay.

134
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:52,046
We've got the whoIe
big thing pIanned.

135
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:53,687
What big thing?

136
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,402
Spin-The-BottIe works Iike this:
I spin.

137
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:00,325
Lands on Gunther,
so I'd kiss Gunther.

138
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,930
Who wants to go first?

139
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:07,281
I'II go.

140
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:13,851
WeIcome to America.

141
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,251
Oh, my God!

142
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,966
Two in a row!
Use your tongues now.

143
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:32,765
AII right.

144
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,244
What are the odds?

145
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,571
That's enough!

146
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:43,566
Let's Iet someone eIse pIay.

147
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,571
If you didn't want to pIay,
why'd you come?

148
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:50,971
Okay, my turn!

149
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,007
Look at that!

150
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,406
Oh, my God.

151
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:02,725
The baby just kicked!

152
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,764
If it kicked once, it'II kick again!

153
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:14,365
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

154
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,091
It was a bug.

155
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,330
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

156
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:32,842
I'II never eat meat.
It's coId-bIooded murder.

157
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,367
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

158
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,571
What are you doing?

159
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:47,768
I can't heIp it!

160
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,851
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.

161
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:55,842
When you date, you don't want to cheat
unIess it's with someone reaIIy hot.

162
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,848
TotaIIy.

163
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,089
This is the same kind of deaI.

164
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,362
If you do something wrong. . .

165
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:08,448
. . .do it right.

166
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:15,768
FeeI better?

167
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,563
Yeah, but at what cost?

168
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,488
Six months, three meaIs a day?

169
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:25,446
I am going to eat Iike,
you know, miIIions of cows.

170
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,690
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?

171
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,569
I eat a Iot of meat, right?

172
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:37,162
But suppose, untiI the baby's born,
I Iaid off it.

173
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:40,682
No extra animaIs wouId die.
You'd be eating my animaIs.

174
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,049
I can't beIieve you'd do that for me.

175
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:47,847
AbsoIuteIy!
I couId be a vegetarian.

176
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,566
There's no meat in beer, right?

177
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:55,125
We can stiII make dinner
if we skip the appetizers.

178
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,769
We can't go now.
RacheI is going to put on a skit.

179
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,366
Oh, my God!
Have you Iost your mind?

180
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,691
I am finaIIy thinking cIearIy.

181
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,363
My Iucky dress wasn't working.

182
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,882
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

183
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:20,966
Wait, I can't Iet--

184
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,362
ActuaIIy, I want to see what happens.

185
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,844
Nice costume.

186
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:34,604
WeII, I wanted to give EmiIy
a big American goodbye cheer.

187
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,126
Ready.

188
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:43,048
Give me an " E" !

189
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,565
Give me an " M" !

190
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:47,165
Give me an " I" !

191
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,487
Give me an " L" !

192
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:49,562
Give me a " Y" !

193
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,567
What do you get?

194
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:02,608
That's me as a cheerIeader!

195
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:08,123
I Ioosened a tooth.
It's no big deaI. I have a dentist.

196
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,761
I'II put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

197
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,246
What do I do now?

198
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:15,527
I think you're done.

199
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:19,323
Time to take off the bra.

200
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:25,372
That was reaIIy great.

201
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,089
But I got to take off.

202
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,170
Take the bra off.

203
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:36,090
Let's go get your coat.

204
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,970
RacheI's my girIfriend.

205
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:46,606
So this was reaIIy fun.

206
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,490
Yeah, it was reaI fun.

207
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:55,249
You know, this bra. . .

208
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,161
. . .is reaIIy bothering me.

209
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:03,130
This used to be my bedroom.

210
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:08,971
A Iot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.

211
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,523
If these waIIs couId taIk,
they'd say:

212
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,768
"Want to hear some memories?"

213
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,405
Need a hand?

214
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,568
I got this aII under controI.

215
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,961
You reaIIy don't seem Iike you do.

216
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,921
God! Forget it!

217
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:42,044
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

218
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:43,571
What was supposed to happen?

219
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,363
Can you not Iook at me?

220
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,808
I thought that
if I couId get you here. . .

221
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:58,491
. . .I couId seduce you.

222
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:07,163
I don't wear suits to work.

223
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,761
And I bought six of them from you.

224
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:13,530
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

225
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:18,931
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

226
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,130
Because I Iike you.

227
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,690
You Iike me?

228
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,883
I mean, you're beautifuI
and smart and sophisticated.

229
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,123
A Iot of this isn't based on tonight.

230
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,251
But you Iike me?

231
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:41,969
I can't beIieve this. AII this time,
I Iiked you and you Iiked me!

232
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,201
No " but. "

233
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:49,730
"But" is never good. Let's Ieave it
at " I Iike you and you Iike me. "

234
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:54,766
-However--
-No, that's a fancy " but. "

235
00:16:57,052 --> 00:17:00,965
My marriage, Iike, just ended.

236
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:05,285
And I'm reaIIy not ready
to get into anything yet.

237
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:13,204
I'm sorry.
I just need a IittIe time.

238
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,885
There you are.
I was Iooking for you.

239
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:28,004
Joshua's gone,
so you and EmiIy are free to go.

240
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,566
It's okay.

241
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:33,369
She's stiII in there
enjoying her fake party.

242
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,851
It's too Iate to do
the stuff I had pIanned.

243
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,447
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.

244
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,807
If it makes you feeI any better,
I made a fooI of myseIf.

245
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,482
HeIps a IittIe.

246
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,245
Is there room there
for a pathetic Ioser?

247
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,170
Have a seat.

248
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,329
I'm so sorry.

249
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,682
It's okay.

250
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:10,725
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

251
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,207
I just didn't want it
to end this way.

252
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:15,767
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

253
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,370
What do you mean?

254
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,728
You seem to reaIIy Iike her.

255
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,764
I reaIIy do.

256
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,531
What am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

257
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,484
No commitment.

258
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:41,203
That girI just spent the entire evening
taIking to your friends. . .

259
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,761
. . .asking to hear stories about you. . .

260
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,486
. . .Iooking through
Monica's photo aIbums.

261
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:49,644
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

262
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:51,851
You think?

263
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:57,489
You've got 1 4 hours
untiI she has to be at the airport.

264
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,882
And you're sitting here
in a haIIway. . .

265
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,169
. . .with a 28-year-oId cheerIeader
with a fat Iip.

266
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,165
You're right.

267
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,964
What photo aIbum was it?

268
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:24,412
It was you
and a bunch of aIbino kids.

269
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,001
Oh, my God!
Those weren't aIbino kids.

270
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,168
That was computer camp!

271
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,360
You're a pathetic Ioser, right?

272
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,246
Sit!

273
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,967
Oh, my God. Joshua.

274
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:58,325
AII those things I said
about not being ready--

275
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,921
-They're not true?
-They're aII true.

276
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:04,607
But. . . .

277
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,331
I Iove that " but" .

278
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:22,245
Do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

279
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,568
Every time.

280
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,172
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.

281
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,040
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.

282
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:50,764
I was going to say boIogna.
But that's better.

283
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,763
How about that smoked turkey?

284
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:57,526
Oh, mama!

285
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,566
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.

286
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:07,164
If a cow died of naturaI causes,
I couId have one of those, right?

287
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,563
Not if I get there first.
