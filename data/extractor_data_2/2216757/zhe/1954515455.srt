1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,723
- 爸 咱得谈谈 - 谈什么 那些蜜蜂吗
- Dad, we need to talk. - Is it about the bees?

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,693
-蜜蜂 -两周后
- Bees? - We're throwing

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,373
我们准备开一个暖房派对
a housewarming party in two weeks.

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:08,196
哦
Oh.

5
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:09,613
朋友们啊 邻居们啊都要过来
It's gonna be friends,neighbors...

6
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,115
他刚才说的是 他说的是蜜蜂吗
Did he say... did he say "bees"?

7
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,535
是啊 马修这几天没日没夜地工作
Yeah. Marshall's been working very long hours lately,

8
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:17,571
所以我只好一个人准备这个派对
so I have been planning this whole party by myself,

9
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,424
所有东西都买齐了 吃的 喝的
and everything's in place: the food, the wine.

10
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:23,577
我还从网上买了一块很赞的高达奶酪
I even found a rare Gouda on the Internet.

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,762
噢
Oh.

12
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:25,963
回到蜜蜂的话题
Getting back to these bees...

13
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,015
不管如何 这个派对对我来说很重要
Bottom line: this party is very important to me,

14
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:32,519
所以我觉得 当然我是充满爱意说的
so I can only assume-- and I say this with love--

15
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,921
你肯定会把派对搞砸了
you're gonna ruin it.

16
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,840
莉莉 我保证不会搞砸你的派对
Lily, I promise I won't ruin your party.

17
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,592
我保证表现得又迷人又有爱
I'll be charming and convivial.

18
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:39,944
表现得像正常的伯特・雷诺（美国一影星）
A regular Burt Reynolds.

19
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,645
你真没什么需要顾虑的
You have absolutely nothing to worry about.

20
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,747
给我们讲讲蜜蜂的事儿
Tell us about the bees!

21
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,950
好吧 既然你问了
Well, all right, since you asked.

22
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,284
我开始做养蜂这一行了
I'm starting up a business

23
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,987
生产全有机的 全手工制作的蜂蜜
cultivating all-organic, artisanal honey.

24
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,790
没错 我在创业
That's right, I'm a job creator.

25
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,125
喔 那么这场派对
Oh. So this party...

26
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,961
噢 莉莉 等等 呃 如果你不介意的话
Oh, Lily, wait. Um, if you don't mind,

27
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,413
我 还有个小问题
I just, I have one follow-up.

28
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,216
你在哪儿做这个呢
Where are you doing this exactly?

29
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,135
楼下啊 地下室里有一万只蜜蜂
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees in the basement.

35
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,973
嘿 伙计们
Hey Guys

36
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,140
罗宾用了一整天的时间
Robin here has spent

37
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:29,243
{\an8}鸡蛋蒸锅是类似馅饼一样的犹太人食物,一般由鸡蛋面或土豆做成,其中还放入诸多配料

38
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:29,243
学做鸡蛋蒸锅
all day learning how to make kugel.

39
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,028
{\an8}Zabar为曼哈顿上西区知名超市

40
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,028
不过没学会 这是从扎巴餐厅买的
Couldn't figure it out-- this is from Zabar's.

41
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,696
能用你家烤箱加热下吗
Can we heat it up in your oven?

42
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:35,366
哈 用烤箱总比用冰箱加热快一些
Faster than heating it up in the refrigerator.

43
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,501
我喝了几杯鸡尾酒
I've had a few cocktails.

44
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:39,103
-给我吧 -拿着吧
- I got it. - Take that.

45
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,322
孩子们 有一天你们要办一个派对
Kids, someday you're gonna throw a party,

46
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:44,091
那时候你就会担心
and you might find yourself worrying

47
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,876
一些事情要出岔子
if something's gonna go wrong.

48
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,828
不用担心
Well, don't.

49
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,465
你实际要担心的是所有事情都要出岔子
What you should worry about is everything going wrong.

50
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:55,302
出事速度之快 绝对让你胆寒
And what's really scary is how quickly that can happen.

51
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,104
比如莉莉和马修的暖房派对
At Lily and Marshall's housewarming party

52
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:00,641
就只用了5分钟
for instance, it only took five minutes.

53
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,794
在这5分钟里发生了很多事
Now, a lot happened in those five minutes.

54
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:07,781
知道吗 我打算一个屋一个屋的说
You know what? I'm gonna take this room by room.

55
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,850
先从起居室说起
We'll start in the living room.

56
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,488
哦 不好 那可不行
Oh, no, that's not what you want.

57
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,657
- 啥 - 没事儿 你觉得
- What? - Oh, nothing. So, you think

58
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,825
你觉得这个派对怎么样
this is going pretty well?

59
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,126
宝贝 你开玩笑呢
Baby, are you kidding?

60
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,361
你一手操办了本年度最棒派对
You single-handedly pulled off the party of the year.

61
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:24,081
不要说了啦 人家用了两只手嘛
Oh, stop it. I used both hands.

62
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,532
那么 我能帮你干点什么
So, what can I do to help?

63
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:28,552
亲爱的 你好不容易才休息一次
Honey, this is your first night off in however long.

64
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,422
你就好好歇着 喝点小酒
You just relax and keep knocking back those cocktails.

65
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,923
库茨先生
Mr. Cootes.

66
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,976
终于能休息一晚上 感觉挺好吧
Hey, isn't it nice to finally have a night off?

67
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,095
是啊 但今晚轮不着咱们休息
It is. But tonight is not that night.

68
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,213
45分钟后我们得赶回公司
We're going back to the office in 45 minutes.

69
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:42,215
先生 可这是我们的暖房派对啊
But, sir, this is our housewarming party.

70
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,718
你知道么 地球母亲也正在开一个
You know, Mother Earth is also having

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,104
暖 房派对
a "housewarming" party, too,

72
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:51,108
只是她的派对是以海面上升 人类沉到海底
only hers ends with humankind at the bottom of a rising ocean,

73
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,944
被黄貂鱼吃进肚子告终的
passing through the digestive tract of a stingray.

74
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,580
不管怎样 你家真漂亮
By the way, it's a lovely home.

75
00:02:56,582 --> 00:03:00,617
库茨先生 我知道您是素食主义者 所以我
Mr. Cootes, I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,

76
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,954
在那儿给您准备了几个素馅春卷
I got some vegan spring rolls for you over there.

77
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,090
噢 美味哟
Oh, nummies!

78
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:08,959
你要赶回去工作
You're going back to work?

79
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,845
诶哟 马修 你简直跟那啥一样忙
Sheez, Marshall, you are as busy as a...

80
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:15,432
哦 对了 你跟啥一样忙来着
Oh, gosh, what are you as busy as?

81
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,633
求求你别说蜜蜂
Please don't talk about the bees.

82
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,018
其实我想说你跟尼古拉斯・凯奇一样忙
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.

83
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,304
那爷们啥都演
That guy is in everything.

84
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,422
咱放点音乐吧
Let's just put on some music.

85
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,362
我 呃 我去把高达奶酪拿出来
I'll, uh, I'll bring out the Gouda,

86
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,764
我们开几瓶红酒
we'll open a couple bottles of wine...

87
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,232
可那些红酒在地下室
that are in the basement.

88
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,251
好吧 我去拿养蜂人的防护服去
All right, I'll get my beekeeper's suit.

89
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:35,903
你们该因为蜜蜂高兴
You should be happy about the bees.

90
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,437
它们把老鼠困在了地下室
They're keeping the mice at bay.

91
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,438
这儿还有老鼠
We have mice?

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,957
不过蜜蜂到处飞
Not with all these bees

93
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,208
就没有了
flying around, we don't.

94
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,160
不用客气哈
You're welcome.

95
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,663
泰德 小高达要出来了 表现得活跃点
Ted, baby Gouda's coming out. Look alive.

96
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,419
你是素食主义者吗
Are you a vegan?

97
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,837
啥
What?

98
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,339
喔咿
Ooh-ee!

99
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:58,092
来厨房 现在
Kitchen, now.

100
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:01,345
我真不敢相信库茨非要我们晚上加班
I can't believe that he's making us go to work tonight.

101
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,982
你 是不是 一个 素食主义者
Are... you... a... vegan?

102
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:06,934
嗯 不是的
Um, no.

103
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,436
好的 那当你一口口地把春卷咽下去的时候
Uh-huh. And when you were shoveling

104
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,356
有没有注意到放春卷的盘子上
the spring rolls down your gullet, did you happen to notice

105
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,992
清晰地标着 素食者专用
a little sign next to the plate marked "Vegan"?

106
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,643
我觉着咱俩之间有点儿误会
I think there's been some mistake.

107
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,813
你可以吃了那桌上的任何东西
You could have had anything on that table!

108
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,532
任何   东西
Anything at all!

109
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,085
迷你披萨饼 培根卷无花果
Mini pizzas, bacon-wrapped figs,

110
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,453
猪肉肠面包卷
pigs in blankets.

111
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,338
据说甚至还有原产地的高达奶酪
There was even talk of an inbound Gouda!

112
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,958
但是 不 不 你居然唯独吃了那一样东西
But no, no, you had to have the one thing

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,627
像我这样的素食者唯一可以吃的东西
that someone with my dietary preferences can eat.

114
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,629
听着 我没有吃春卷
Look, I didn't eat the spring rolls.

115
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,464
骗子
Liar!

116
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:40,484
你的呼吸里都带着一丝丝胡萝卜和欺骗的恶臭
Your breath reeks of shredded carrots and deceit!

117
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,174
好的 好的 或许我确实吃了你的春卷
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat your precious spring rolls.

118
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,275
哦
Oh...

119
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,844
你又能把我怎么样呢 你这个小嬉皮士
What are you gonna do about it, hippie?

120
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,699
没事 一切顺利
It's fine. Everything's fine.

121
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:58,152
年轻人
Young man,

122
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:01,238
你是在挑衅
are you suggesting fisticuffs...

123
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,356
要跟我用拳头一绝高低么
as in with our fists?

124
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:06,043
不仅仅是拳头 还有脚 我腿法了得
And feet-- I'm a kicker.

125
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,296
好好好 这感觉就像
Well, well, looks like I just started eating

126
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,165
我回归食肉了那样
white meat again.

127
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:15,669
我会像一只狼灌一样撕咬你的
I will bite and scratch you like a wolverine.

128
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,704
让我警告你一遍
May I warn you,

129
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:20,974
我以前可打过架
I have been in a fight before.

130
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,227
我也打过 一丢丢
So have I... sort of.

131
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,395
哦 天呐
Oh, God.

132
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,515
库茨先生 嗨
Mr. Cootes. Hi.

133
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,218
你看见我们那儿放了豆沙和蔬菜么
Did you see that we had hummus and veggies?

134
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,320
豆沙和蔬菜
There's hummus and veggies?

135
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,554
就在那儿
Over there.

136
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,057
嘿 我可不会再任人宰割了
Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy push me around.

137
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:40,444
我可坚信孙子兵法里有
I believe it was Sun Tzu who wrote, "Never give up.

138
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:41,411
永不言败 永不投降
Never surrender."

139
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,946
-闭嘴 泰德 -好的
-Shut up, Ted.    -Okay.

140
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:47,918
老天啊 莉莉 你可是怀孕了的
For God's sake, Lily, you're pregnant.

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,922
老天啊 泰德 莉莉可是怀孕了的
For God's sake, Ted,Lily's pregnant.

142
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,193
哦 天啊
Oh, man.

143
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,911
非常抱歉发生了这种事
Sorry about that.

144
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,763
我现在不需要你的抱歉 泰德
I don't need this right now, Ted.

145
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,682
我不该这么做的
I shouldn't do this.

146
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:02,916
-我不该这么做啊   -怎么了
- I shouldn't do this. - What?

147
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,103
这个主意糟透了 这个主意糟透了
This is a bad idea. This is a bad idea!

148
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,939
-到底怎么了 -我应该现在闪人 现在就走
- What is? - I should just go. I should just go!

149
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,642
好吧 好吧 告诉我到底发生了什么
Okay, okay, just tell me what is going on.

150
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:14,228
我爱我的弟弟 罗宾
I love my penis, Robin.

151
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,530
哦 巴尼 你承诺过的
Oh, Barney, you promised.

152
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,032
我是承诺过 我爱它
I do! I love it!

153
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,235
如果我可以亲到它的话 我会去亲的
If I could kiss it, I would.

154
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:23,954
如果我跟你说我没试过 那我一定在撒谎
I'd be lying if I told you I hadn't tried.

155
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:26,123
这话题让我感觉到不爽
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.

156
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,943
哦 别这样啊罗宾 我们可是在谈论我的弟弟
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my penis we're talking about.

157
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,162
-你曾经见过她 她是多么的神奇   -她
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent. - She?

158
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:35,132
每一个小弟弟都是个姑娘 罗宾 所有人都知道
Every penis is a girl, Robin. Everyone knows that.

159
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:40,220
就好像 水怪和船都是姑娘一样
Like... ships and lake monsters.

160
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,289
还有高达
And Gouda!

161
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,974
她很美哒
She's a beauta.

162
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,225
哦 高达奶酪
Oh, Gouda.

163
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,460
好吧 我会回来的
Well, I'll be back.

164
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,462
不管怎么样 我身体的大部分会回来的
Most of me, anyway.

165
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,932
-别吃这个 -什么
- Don't eat that.   - What?

166
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,934
我擦 哦 这被毁了
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.

167
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,353
这没有被毁啊 落地十秒内拿起来还可以吃啊
It's not ruined. Ten second rule.

168
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,239
八 九 十 好了 它被毁了
Eight, nine, ten, and it's ruined.

169
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,158
这整个派对都被毁了
This whole party's ruined.

170
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,144
我的储藏室里到处都是蜜蜂
I got a basement full of bees,

171
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,496
而泰德差点和库茨先生打起来
and Ted almost got into a fight with Mr. Cootes.

172
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:08,165
莉莉 看看四周
Lily, look around.

173
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,816
每个人都在享受一段神奇的时光
Everyone's having an amazing time.

174
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,018
这是个很棒的派对
It's a great party.

175
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,838
好吧 或许这不全是一场灾难
Okay, maybe it's not a total disaster.

176
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,528
那是什么玩意儿
What the hell was that?!

177
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,730
这就是发生在客厅的事儿
So that's what happened in the living room.

178
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:35,110
现在让我们把目光转向餐厅
Now I'm gonna tell you what happened in the dining room.

179
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,524
哦 不好 那可不行
Oh, no, that's not what you want.

180
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,429
哦 难以置信这些居然是素食
Man, I can't believe these are vegan.

181
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,663
我吃了 将近二十个
I've had, like, 20 of 'em.

182
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:45,915
我该去问问做这个的餐馆的名字
I should get the name of this caterer.

183
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,385
下礼拜是我那只叫蝙蝠的小猫的成人礼
It's my kitten's Bat Mitzvah next week.

184
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,837
她终于真正成为了一只猫
She's finally becoming a cat.

185
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,872
哦 老天 你真是个疯...
Oh, God, you are crazy.

186
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,974
狂热爱猫的人
About cats.

187
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,544
猫都很忠诚而且情感真挚
Cats are so honest and real with their affections.

188
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,763
自从我离婚后
Ever since my divorce,

189
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,564
我身边的骗子就像过流水灯一样
it's just been one liar after another.

190
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,884
所以感觉如此新鲜当我遇到了如此诚实的你
That's why it's so refreshing to meet someone honest like you,

191
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,720
特工咖喱泡沫
Special Agent Gary Powers.

192
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,105
听着
Listen...

193
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:12,776
我觉得我们之间达成了某种联系
I think we can agree there's something here.

194
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,861
某种丰满的
Something big...

195
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:18,865
看上去很真实 可能感觉也会很真实的联系
that looks and probably feels real.

196
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,251
或许
Maybe...

197
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,952
我们可以去你的地方
we can go back to your place.

198
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,905
我可不能让你延误了去拦截那些小行星
I can't ask you to delay intercepting those asteroids.

199
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,258
我确实得去拦截那些行星
I do need to intercept those asteroids.

200
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,126
我感觉我们应该现在就去滚床单
I think we need to have sex right now.

201
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,247
两分钟后楼上的客房见
Meet me in the upstairs guest bedroom in two minutes.

202
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,602
你们知道那斋春卷在哪里吗
I'm just looking for the vegan spring rolls.

203
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,970
不好意思 最后一个我吃了
Last one, sorry.

204
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,388
两分钟后哦
Two minutes.

205
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,808
它们怎么就没了 派对才刚开始啊
How can they all be gone? The party just started.

206
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,942
可不
I know, right?

207
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:48,278
咱放点音乐吧
Let's just put on some music.

208
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,232
我 呃 我去把高达奶酪拿出来
I'll, uh, I'll bring out the Gouda,

209
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,433
我们开几瓶红酒
we'll open a couple of bottles of wine...

210
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,035
可那些红酒在地下室
that are in the basement.

211
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,370
有个混蛋刚才在这
Some jerk was just here.

212
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:58,705
他就像这样
And he was all, like,

213
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,240
难以置信这些居然是素食
"I can't believe these are vegan.

214
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,407
我吃了 将近二十个
I've had, like, 20 of 'em."

215
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,627
指给我看那个挨千刀的在哪儿
Point me into the direction of this scoundrel.

216
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,380
喏 就是那个家伙
Um... it was that guy.

217
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:10,233
泰德 小高达要出来了 表现得活跃点
Ted, baby Gouda's coming out. Look alive.

218
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:15,221
莉莉 这些春卷 喔咿
Lily, these spring rolls... ooh-ee!

219
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,590
来厨房 现在
Kitchen, now.

220
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:20,727
我真不敢相信库茨非要我们晚上加班
I can't believe that he's making us go to work tonight.

221
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,595
我就是觉得现在得有人把他拉到一个安静点的地方
I mean, I think it's time that somebody took him aside

222
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,764
然后告诉他这么摧残自己的手下是会遭报应的
and told him this is not how you treat your staff.

223
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:28,017
唔 我现在忙的都脱不开身了
Well, I'm sort of busy with the party right now.

224
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,136
好吧 还得我自己来 不过他会朝我大喊大叫的
Fine. I'll do it myself. But he's gonna scream at me,

225
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,821
而你知道我最受不了别人吵我大喊大叫了
and you know that I can't stand up to screaming.

226
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,140
-去和他谈谈 -我也觉得应该和他好好谈谈了
- Just go talk to him! - I think I should go talk to him.

227
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,161
-巴尼 -哦 莉莉
- Barney... - Ah, Lily,

228
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,363
春卷都被泰德一人吃光了
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

229
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,582
你可以吃了那桌上的任何东西
You could have had anything on that table!

230
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:46,085
迷你匹萨饼 培根卷无花果
Mini pizzas, bacon-wrapped figs,

231
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,120
猪肉肠面包卷
pigs in blankets.

232
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:50,156
据说甚至还有原产地的高达奶酪
There was even talk of an inbound Gouda!

233
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,158
罗宾 嗯 听着 我需要你帮我一下
Robin. Okay, listen, I need your help.

234
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,294
我马上就要和我的老板来一个对骂比赛了
I'm about to get in a screaming match with my boss,

235
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,828
而且我又不擅长被别人大喊大叫
and I'm not good at getting screamed at,

236
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,347
所以我需要你帮我热身
so I need you to warm me up.

237
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,132
-怎么热身 -我要你使劲骂我
- How? - I want you to scream at me.

238
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,351
对 就像你被街边的路人甲以一点点小事激怒那样
You know, like you do to strangers on the street

239
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,769
对我开炮吧
at the slightest provocation.

240
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,137
我从来没有过好吧
I don't do that.

241
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,772
来吗 给我点经典的贱人舍巴斯基
Come on, lay some of that classic Scherbatsky

242
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,273
向我开炮吧
mean son of a bitch on me.

243
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,809
就像那些小童子军向你叫卖曲奇那样对我吧
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout trying to sell you cookies.

244
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,895
四美元一盒 你穷疯了是吗
Four dollars a box and you're out of Thin Mints?!

245
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:15,315
你个小绿…… 我不这样的
You green little...! I don't do that!

246
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,816
麻利点 对我大吼大叫吧
Come on, scream at me.

247
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,068
就像那样
Like that.

248
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,286
没事 一切顺利
It's fine. Everything's fine.

249
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,622
马修 有很多事情
Marshall, there is plenty of stuff

250
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,574
都激怒不了我的
that I don't get mad about,

251
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,859
比如你在准备这些猪肉肠面包卷的时候
like the fact that you're serving pigs in blankets

252
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,694
居然没准备芥末
without hot mustard.

253
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,664
我可不是那种人 那种就只为这宴会东家连上这道
I'm not the type of person to be driven crazy by a host

254
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,050
猪肉肠面包卷的时候连芥末都不准备
who refuses to provide delicious hot mustard

255
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:35,969
就立马火冒三丈的人
in which to dip my pigs in blankets!

256
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,037
我是那种 让自己冷静下来的妹子
I'm the type of girl who... keeps her cool.

257
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,006
让自己冷静下来的那种
Who keeps her cool.

258
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,043
等下 哇哦 亲爱的 你没事吧
Wait. Whoa, baby, are you okay?

259
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,212
当然没事了 这派对多好啊
Of course. This party is great.

260
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:49,699
一切尽在掌握 哦 天呐
I am handling this. Oh, God.

261
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,103
别
No...

262
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:55,355
豆泥加蔬菜呢
Hummus and veggies?

263
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:58,074
豆泥和蔬菜在哪里啊
I'm looking for hummus and veggies.

264
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,743
罗宾 我能和你讨论一件对我来说很珍贵的东西吗
Robin, can I talk to you about something very dear to me?

265
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,612
你发誓和你的小弟弟无关
Promise me this isn't about your penis.

266
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:05,014
我保证这绝对和我的小弟弟无关
I promise it isn't about my penis.

267
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,499
不好意思啊
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,688
不好意思 头儿 我能和你到厨房说两句话吗
Excuse me, sir, could I talk to you in the kitchen?

269
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,178
实在抱歉啊
Sorry about that.

270
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,797
我现在不需要你的抱歉 泰德
I don't need this right now, Ted.

271
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,216
我发誓 要是哪里再出点什么乱子
I swear, if there's one more crisis...

272
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,101
好吧 这些蜜蜂都跑出来了
Well, the bees escaped their enclosure,

273
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,804
但这点小事情犯不着大家蜂蜂颠颠的
but no reason to "Bee" Concerned.

274
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,691
好吧 我确实惹麻烦了
No, there is, we're in big trouble.

275
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,309
你那是什么味道
What is that smell?

276
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,594
我把我的外套放在煤油里泡了一会儿
Oh, I doused my suit with kerosene.

277
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,263
所有的养蜂人都这么干
All beekeepers do this.

278
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:39,482
老爸 现在就把这外衣脱了
Dad, just take off the suit right now.

279
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:40,283
好吧
All right, fine.

280
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,101
每30秒
Every 30 seconds,

281
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,287
就有一个新的麻烦等着去解决
there's another crisis that needs to be dealt with

282
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,955
而且还必须得是我去解决
and I have to deal with it.

283
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,708
简直是 哦天呐
This is... Oh, God.

284
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,326
当爹妈就是这样吧 是不是
This is parenthood, isn't it?

285
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:51,577
过来人都这么说
So they say.

286
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,162
好吧 我正式宣布
Okay, it's official.

287
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,548
我以为我可以做到 但是我做不到
I thought I could do it, but I can't.

288
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,083
我做不到 马修永远都在工作
No, Marshall's always at work.

289
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,551
他今天晚上就得再回去了
He's got to go back tonight.

290
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,503
而且我实在是不知道我道理能不能处理好
And I don't know if I can handle a life

291
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,805
这一波接着一波混乱的人生啊
that's just one crisis after another.

292
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,124
莉莉 听好了 我要给你一点小
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna give you a little piece of...

293
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,476
高达
Gouda!

294
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:07,460
天呐
God.

295
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,312
-又有麻烦了吗 -又有麻烦了
- Crisis? - Crisis.

296
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,815
-别吃那个 呦 -什么
- Don't eat that. Whoops! - What?

297
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,150
高达出场了 泰德 别在上面吃睡着了
Gouda's out, Ted. Don't sleep on the Gouda.

298
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,351
我可不想
Wouldn't dream of it.

299
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,136
那么莉莉告诉我说你今晚得回去工作是吧
So Lily told me you have to go back to work tonight?

300
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,855
不 我今晚不用回去工作了
No, I don't have to go back to work tonight.

301
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,273
库茨先生和我达成了共识
Mr. Cootes and I came to an understanding.

302
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,658
但是 嘿 罗宾怎么了
But, hey, what's going on with Robin?

303
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,609
我说她是个自私的婊子
I called her a mean son of a bitch

304
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,810
然后她的反应太奇怪了
and she took it all weird.

305
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,446
-很奇怪吗   -是的
- She did? - Yeah.

306
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,630
不正常 对吧
Crazy, right?

307
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,365
嘿 大伙儿
Hey, buddy.

308
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,034
史上最棒的暖房派对
Best housewarming party ever.

309
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:33,486
每个人都嗡嗡的
Everybody's abuzz.

310
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:34,987
嗡嗡的
Abuzz.

311
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,539
噢 一语双关 米奇
Oh, good one, Mickey.

312
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,840
但是 嘿 你说的很对
But, hey, you're right.

313
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,826
很棒的派对
Great party.

314
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,886
到底是怎么回事
What the hell was that?!

315
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,749
这就是发生在餐厅的事情
And that's what happened in the dining room.

316
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,494
现在我要告诉你们在厨房发生了什么
Now I'm gonna tell you what happened in the kitchen.

317
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:04,493
哦 不好 那可不行
Oh, no, that's not what you want.

318
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,929
哦 难以置信这些居然是素食
Man, I can't believe these are vegan.

319
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,130
回到争吵状态
Back to our fight?

320
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:09,581
回到争吵状态
Back to our fight.

321
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,900
我不敢相信你在扎吧对一个女人大喊大叫
I cannot believe you screamed at that woman at Zabar's.

322
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,268
她想要插队
She was trying to cut in line.

323
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,753
她想要拿走最后一份鸡蛋蒸锅
She was gonna get the last kugel.

324
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,971
她已经90高龄了
She was 90 years old.

325
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,107
这可能也是她的最后一份鸡蛋蒸锅了
It was probably gonna be her last kugel.

326
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,942
有些时候 你需要果断一点
Sometimes in life, you have to be assertive

327
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,259
保护自己利益
and stand up for yourself.

328
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,594
你管叫她婊子
You called her a whore.

329
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,062
谁没事化这么浓的妆
Who wears that much makeup?!

330
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,030
老婆婆们
Old ladies!

331
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,149
那些卖身换钱的人 太对了
Who take money for sex. Exactly.

332
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,535
听着 我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

333
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,270
如果我把这件事情交给你那白皙秀丽
If I would've left things in your dainty, lily-white,

334
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,156
从未薅掉一个老婆婆假发的手里
never-ripped- an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,

335
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,208
我们现在就没有鸡蛋蒸锅了
we would be kugel-free right now.

336
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,876
哦 所以说呢 我太好了
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?

337
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,461
你从来不为自己争取
You never stand up for yourself.

338
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,914
记得那个一直偷你午饭的六年级生么
Remember that sixth grader who kept stealing your lunch?

339
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,750
高中是我的艰难时代 好么
High school was a tough time for me, okay?

340
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,335
而且那个女孩是肌肉型的
And that girl was muscular.

341
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,003
手臂跟大力水手一样
Forearms like Popeye.

342
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,638
你怎么会知道这件事的
How do you even know about that?

343
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,924
马修告诉我的 他还说了
Marshall told me. He also said that

344
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,342
你让你妈妈不再做
you had your mom stop making

345
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,893
果酱和花生酱三明治
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

346
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,628
因为那个女孩对坚果过敏
because of that girl's nut allergy.

347
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,347
我不想加重她的身体问题
I didn't want to add to her health problems.

348
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:59,648
她已经坐轮椅了
She was already in a wheelchair.

349
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,299
好的 所以呢
Okay, so what?

350
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,135
我宁愿忍让些也不愿做你这样的人
I would rather be nice than be like you,

351
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,821
总是跟人争执那些
always getting in fights about stuff

352
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,272
鸡毛蒜皮不值得的小事
that's not even worth fighting about.

353
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,473
不同意
Disagree.

354
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,993
孙子在孙子兵法里面写过
It's like Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War,

355
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,028
永不言败 永不投降
"Never give up. Never surrender."

356
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,830
那是提姆艾伦在星河奇遇里面写的
That was Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest.

357
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:15,981
无论如何 哥们
Whatever, dude.

358
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,000
你的问题就是无论何时 
Your problem is any time you're faced with

359
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,035
面对任何对峙的时候 你就逃跑
the least bit of confrontation, you run away.

360
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,604
哦 我在逃避对峙
Oh, I run away from confrontation?

361
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,794
泰德 小高达要出来了
Ted, baby Gouda's coming out.

362
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,145
表现得活跃点
Look alive.

363
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,182
哦 你个...
Whoops. Son of a...!

364
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,833
抱歉
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,552
也许那是我的错
Maybe that was my fault.

366
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:37,719
你也发现了
You think?

367
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,104
你挡住了我拿吃的的路
You're right in my snack track.

368
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,557
嘿 帅气的养蜂人装束
Hey, nice beekeeper suit.

369
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,676
你知道么 大多数蜜蜂是左撇子
Do you know that, uh, most bees are left-handed?

370
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,145
你知道蜜蜂很讨厌煤油的味道么
Did you know bees hate the smell of kerosene?

371
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,814
我当然知道 天呐 你以为
I knew that. Geez, what do you think,

372
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,732
这是我当养蜂人的第一天么
this is my first day as a beekeeper?

373
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:53,402
太棒了 哦
Nice. Oh.

374
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:56,071
蜜蜂讨厌煤油是真的么
Is that true about bees and kerosene?

375
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,689
我不知道
I don't know.

376
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,074
巴尼
Barney...

377
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,075
哦 莉莉
Ah, Lily,

378
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:02,244
春卷都被泰德一人吃光了
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

379
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,079
巴尼 那个跟你说话的女人
Barney, that woman you were talking to,

380
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,047
也就是我们的邻居杰拉德琳
our neighbor Geraldine,

381
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,648
有个人跟她睡了
some guy slept with her

382
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,751
却没再打电话给她 于是她追踪到了他
and didn't call her, so she hunted him down

383
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:14,556
然后用一把芝士刀切掉了他身体的某个部分
and cut off a certain part of his anatomy with a cheese knife.

384
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,009
所以 无论你做什么
So, whatever you do,

385
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,510
别上她
don't sleep with her.

386
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:22,347
这太有趣了 她在 唔 
It's funny, she is, um, waiting for me

387
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,149
她正在客卧等着我
in the guest bedroom right now.

388
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,051
哦 天呐 哦 天呐
Oh, God! Oh, God!

389
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,570
那是原本的打算 但是我现在已经忘了
That was the idea, but now forget it!

390
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:29,855
巴尼 这是一场灾难
Barney, this is a disaster.

391
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:32,241
我发誓 只要这里有一个..
I swear, if there is one...

392
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:34,392
没事 一切顺利
It's fine. Everything's fine.

393
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,911
十秒法则:掉在地上的东西十秒内捡起来都是干净的

394
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,911
嘿 不超过十秒 对吧
Hey, ten second rule, right?

395
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:40,365
没事 一切顺利
It's fine. Everything's fine.

396
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,868
走开 走开 走开
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

397
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,420
我知道你怀孕了 但你需要来点酒压压惊
I know you're pregnant, but you need a glass of wine.

398
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,238
这块奶酪我是从网上买的
I got that cheese off the Internet.

399
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,674
我知道你是在网上买的
I know you got it off the Internet.

400
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,008
网上买的又咋了
Why does that make it impressive?

401
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,094
你知道网上还有什么吗
You know what else you can find on the Internet?

402
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,795
动物园里的动物打飞机
Zoo animals masturbating.

403
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,597
哥还见过一只海象
There's one of a walrus.

404
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,748
他
He's...

405
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,934
噢
Oh.

406
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,981
别
No...

407
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,203
不好意思 头儿 我能和你到厨房说两句话吗
Excuse me, sir, could I talk to you in the kitchen?

408
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,782
库茨先生 今晚我是不会回去工作的
Mr. Cootes, I am not going back to work tonight.

409
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,668
喔 她刚刚说了什么
Oh, no, she didn't just say that.

410
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,253
米奇 能给我们俩一会儿时间单独谈谈
Mickey, could we just have a minute?

411
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,673
哦 好的 当然可以
Oh, yeah. Sure.

412
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,894
马修 你看 我知道当你刚来公司的时候
Marshall, look, I know when you started with this firm,

413
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,596
我们的工作看起来很有意思
it was all fun and games.

414
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:48,400
尤其是晋升大战更激动人心
The office chair races were particularly spirited.

415
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,737
直到 呃 盖尔从楼梯上摔了下去
Until, of course, Gail went down the stairs.

416
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,405
但就在那个瞬间
But for one brief moment,

417
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:55,941
神哪 我相信她飞起来了
boy, did she fly.

418
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,028
当我没在 当我没在
I'm not here, I'm not here.

419
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,364
库茨先生 你是个极品工作狂
Mr. Cootes, you're working yourself to death.

420
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,816
拜托就放松那么一会儿
Just cut loose a little.

421
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:07,285
来点啤酒 发展发展兴趣爱好
Have a beer, find a hobby.

422
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,171
你看 孩子 道理很简单
Look, son, it's very simple.

423
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,990
嗯 地球母亲从来都不休息
Um, Mother Earth doesn't get a night off.

424
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:13,208
所以你也休想
Neither do you.

425
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,593
那好 我辞职
Well, then I quit.

426
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,932
我真不知道我能不能去适应这种生活
And I don't know if I can handle a life

427
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,851
烦心事一件接一件的发生
that's just one crisis after another.

428
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,137
莉莉 听好了 我要给你一点小
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna give you a little piece of...

429
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,471
高达
Gouda!

430
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,439
他可能是对的
Maybe he's right.

431
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,725
我或许确实需要培养一个兴趣爱好
Maybe I do need a hobby.

432
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,360
呃 嘿 养蜜蜂怎么样
Well, hey, how about beekeeping?

433
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:34,446
我 不好 关于蜜蜂我是什么都不知道
Me? No. I-I don't know the first thing about bees.

434
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,732
告诉你个秘密
You want to know a secret?

435
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,100
我也不懂
Neither do I.

436
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,452
这个不是秘密
It's not a secret.

437
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,487
我试试这件装备
Let me try this thing on.

438
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:43,872

I'm gonna give you some privacy.

00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,707
好的 谢谢
All right, thank you.

440
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:46,958
