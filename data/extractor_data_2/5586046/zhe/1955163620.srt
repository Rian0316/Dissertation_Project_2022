It's nice to get back to nature.

你在干什么呢?
Whatcha doing?

7
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,186
我在享受虚拟现实呢
I was enjoying some virtual reality,

8
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:32,189
而你真实的脸把这一切都毁了
until you ruined it with your actual face.

9
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,492
这是什么味道?
What am I smelling?

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:35,793
这是空气清新剂
Oh, it's car air freshener.

11
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,763
我在模拟森林的气味
I was simulating the smell of the forest.

12
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:40,731
森林可不是这个味道
That's not what the forest smells like.

13
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,900
我怎么知道?
Well, how would I know?

14
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,404
你干嘛要假装自己在外出啊?
Why are you pretending to be outdoors?

15
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:47,405

You hate it.

16
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,374
Amy给我看了一份研究报告
Amy showed me a compelling study

17
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:52,276

对认知能力有好处
of spending time in the wilderness.

19
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,246
哥们 你要是愿意
Buddy, I am ready to drive you

20
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:56,881
我随时开车送你去野外
into the wilderness any time you want

21
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,649
然后把你丢在那里
and leave you there.

22
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,752
你开玩笑好了 但是有一些受试者
Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants

23
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:04,655
在森林里过了四天没有现代科技的生活

25
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,963
要是那是真的 这个世界上怎么没有天才松鼠呢?
Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?

26
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:17,368

你要是真的想去看大自然的话
You know, if you really want to be in nature,

42
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:03,829
要不我们租一间林中小屋吧?

不好意思啊 你到底是什么时候来的啊? 我...
Look, I'm sorry, when did you even get here? I...

有一个跟我合作的医生
You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear

45
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,669
一直让我去住一间在大熊区的小屋
that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.

46
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,971
他是想追你吧?
Because he's hitting on you?

47
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:12,972
是个女的
She.

48
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:14,507

I'll see if it's available.

63
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,813
如果那个研究是正确的话
You know, if that study's real,

64
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,448
Leonard回来的时候说不定会比你更聪明呢
Leonard might come back smarter than you.

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,617
- 你是想摆布我吗?  - 是的
- Are you trying to manipulate me?  - Yes.

66
00:02:58,619 --> 00:02:59,785
干得好 你成功了 我们走
Well done, it worked, we're going.

把袋子给我吧
give me a bag.

70
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,126
不行 不行 你都怀孕了
No, no, you're pregnant.

71
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,794
你只要安安心心
The only thing you carry

72

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,969
呃 Raj带我去看妇产科医生
Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor

75
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,337
然后我们去逛了一会儿菜场
and then we swung by the grocery store.

76
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,805
你买饼干了吗?
Did you get graham crackers?

77
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:24,076
我说... 我... 胎儿还好吗?
I mean, are... what... is the baby okay?

00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,248
我都不知道你今天需要帮忙啊
I didn't know you needed help running errands today.

80
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,883
本来是不需要 Raj主动要帮忙的
I didn't, but Raj volunteered.

81
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,017
真的?
Really?

82
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,219
是啊 你告诉他我怀孕了以后
Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant,

83
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,854
他一直对我的事很积极
he's really been making a fuss over me.

84
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,323
是嘛 他人真好
Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.

85
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,227
Bernie 我刚刚给你发了一份
Bernie, I just forwarded you a list

86
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,296
洛杉矶最好的五家哺乳顾问的表格
of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles.

87
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,664
我已经挑好了
I know my favorite,

88
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,367
不过我想听听你的意见
but I'd love to hear what you think.

89
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,937
现在感觉有点奇怪了
And it just got weird.

90
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:56,809
嘿 Amy到楼下了
Hey. Amy's downstairs.

91
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,644

Okay, one sec.

92
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,280
呃 你... 你那是什么呀?
Uh, what... what you got goin' on here?

93
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:04,250
我买了一个棒球帽
I bought a baseball cap.

94
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,885
看出来了
I can see that.

95
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,052
是哪个队的?
What team did you get?

96
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:10,289
呃 是赫夫帕夫 哈利波特里的
Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.

97
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,292
哎 反正我们在树林里
Well, we'll be in the woods.

98
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,595
我准备好了
I'm ready to go.

99
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,100
你有什么话要对他说吗?
Anything you'd like to say to him?

100
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,501
Sheldon 帽子不错
Nice hat, Sheldon.

101
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,004
谢谢
Thanks.

102
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,939
你干嘛对我那么刻薄啊?
Why are you so mean to me?

103
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:42,121
你在看什么啊?
What the hell are you watching?

104
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:45,791
Raj给我找了一些女人分娩的视频
Raj found all these childbirth videos online.

105
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:48,627
这一段是一个女人在河里生孩子
This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.

106
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,964
那是我这辈子见过的
Okay, that is the least Jewish thing

107
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,266
最不合犹太传统的事情
I've ever seen in my life.

108
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,838
有没有觉得Raj对这些孩子有关的事情
You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,307
热情的太过分了?
with all the baby stuff?

110
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:02,474
没觉得
I don't think so.

111
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,176
他只是想参与进来
He just wants to be part of the experience.

112
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,445
好吧 如果你这么觉得的话
All right, if you say so.

113
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,546
盒子里是什么?
What's in the box?

114
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:08,948
是一个能让我们听见小孩心跳的
Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone

115
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,316
超声波机器
so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.

116
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,117
噢
Oh.

117
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,118
不错啊
That's cool.

118
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,119
要不试试?
Can we try it?

119
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,721
事实上是Raj订购的
Actually, Raj ordered it.

120
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,524
他让我答应等他来了再试
He made me promise to wait till he was here.

121
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,192
这样他就能...
So he can be...

122
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,161
参与进来?
part of the experience?

123
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,362
是的
Yeah.

124
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,932
他允许我们怀孕的时候不叫上他还真让我意外呢
I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.

125
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:29,835
别哪壶不开提哪壶
It's a sore spot... don't bring it up.

126
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,573
这里真是空气清新又美好
It's so cute and rustic up here.

127
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:35,808
是啊
I know.

128
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,843
你看见他们还有一个租录像带的地方了吗?
Did you see they still have a video rental place?

129
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:40,045
看起来像威廉斯堡
it's like Colonial Williamsburg.

130
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,281
呃...
Well...

131
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:44,984
手机信号只有一格了
cell service is down to one bar,

132
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:47,219
如果有谁需要医疗护理
so if anyone needs medical attention

133
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,655
或是告诉陌生人他的政治观点蠢透了
or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid,

134
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:50,990
过了这个村就没这个店了
now's the time.

135
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,892
你有什么时候下线过吗?
Have you ever been off the grid before?

136
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,561
有过一次
Once.

137
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,062
我手机上的电池没电了
The battery ran out on my phone.

138
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,498
而iPAD又正在开机
I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.

139
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,935
我真怕他会吃了我
I was afraid he was gonna eat me.

140
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,072
Raj正在停车
Raj just pulled up.

141
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,842
我得跟他讲讲
I'm gonna say something to him.

142
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:11,877
随他吧 他是好意
Leave it alone. He means well.

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,780
你不觉得他应该克制一点吗?
So you don't think he needs to rein it in a little?

144
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,849
没觉得
No, not really.

145
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,417
你不在乎
And you're not concerned

146
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,287
他的做法就像你肚子里的是他的孩子一样?
he's acting like somehow this is his kid, too?

147
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,422
他只是支持我
He's just trying to be supportive.

148
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,190
只是支持你
Just supportive.

149
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,192
没觉得太过吗?
Not over-the-top in any way?

150
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:29,194
没有
No.

151
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,963
你们好
Hello!

152
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:37,636
你刚看见他搬这个进来了
You saw him carrying that.

153
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,906
在天上都能看见
Astronauts saw him carrying that.

154
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,915
地方不错呀!
This place is great!

155
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:52,484
那个医生让你住进来真太好了
So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.

156
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:54,920
她要带我去听蓝色少女音乐会
Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert,

157
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,655
有亏有赚
so hold that thought.

158
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,825
好吧
Okay.

159
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,327
呃
Well,

160
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,462
我们要不要检查一下对方身上的虱子?
should we check each other for ticks?

161
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,501
我们不过是从车里走过来而已
Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.

162
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,136
好吧 随你便
Oh. Well, suit yourself.

163
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,339
谁想检查一下我?
Who wants to check me?

164
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,510
其实吧 安全第一
On the other hand, safety first.

165
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,049
真的开始下雨了
Wow, it's really coming down.

166
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,517
真讨厌
This sucks.

167
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,818
野外徒步也去不了了
And there goes our hike.

168
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,621
噢 别啊!
Oh, not our hike!

169
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,023
现在我们必须
Now we have

170
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,458
呆在屋子里 安全又暖和
to stay safe and warm.

171
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,027
我们还是可以去的
You know, we could still go.

172
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,461
一点雨又杀不了你
A little rain isn't gonna kill us.

173
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,197
你跟Sheldon一起淋过雨吗?
Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?

174
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,232
- 没有  - 还不如死了呢
- No.  - You'll wish it would kill you.

175
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,036
那我们现在干什么?
So what do we do now?

176
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,304
那有桌牌游戏
They have some board games.

177
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,906
大部分叠叠乐的积木都不见了
Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing

178
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,942
拼字游戏的也只剩下七块了
and the Scrabble only has seven tiles,

179
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,444
如果你想拼个毫无技术含量的形状
so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure

180
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,447
摆在"SHNERPF"旁边 那你就去玩吧
with the word "SHNERPF" next to it, move on.

181
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,216
我们生一堆火吧
Hey, let's light a fire.

182
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,351
不错啊
Ooh, that sounds cozy.

183
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,919
我以前没生过火
I don't think I've lit a real fire before.

184
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,754
只是最基本的热力学
Ah, it's basic thermodynamics.

185
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,156
我们能搞定的
I'm sure we can figure that out.

186
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,459
我能把柴火堆成圆锥形利于空气流动
I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.

187
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,062
那样能最大化氧气供给促进燃烧
That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.

188
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,530
对 所以我们只需要...
Right. So all we need is to...

189
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,098
搞定
Got it.

190
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,369
那是科学家的杰作
A scientist made that.

191
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,308
Raj 你是我在这个世界上最好的朋友
Look, Raj, you're my best friend in the world

192
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,013
我感谢你对孩子的热心
and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.

193
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,849
乐意效劳
Please, my pleasure.

194
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,452
Howie和我
And, of course, Howie and I

195
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,053
都想让你参与进来
both want you to be a part of all this.

196
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,123
但是我们还是有些界限的
But we have to set some boundaries.

197
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,025
我不明白
I don't understand.

198
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,895
不是我们三个人在生孩子
The three of us aren't having this baby.

199
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,598
是我们两个人的
Just the two of us.

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,101
噢...
Oh...

201
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,304
好吧 我明白了
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

202
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,706
我会冷静一些的
I'll back off.

203
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,441
感谢理解
Thanks for understanding.

204
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,476
当然了
Of course.

205
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,779
我会留给你们一些空间
I'll give you guys some space.

206
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,383
我还是把这个搬走吧
Let me just get this out of your way.

207
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,825
需要帮忙吗?
You need some help?

208
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,395
不用 我能搞定
No, I got it.

209
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,003
Raj... Raj 等等
Raj... Raj, wait.

210
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,239
Bernadette 拜托
Please, Bernadette.

211
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,242
让我带着尊严离开吧
Let me leave with my dignity.

212
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,089
嘿 你们想喝酒玩吗?
Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?

213
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,024
好吧 那我们输定了
Oh, well now, well now, we'll never win.

214
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,727
你是酒场老手
You always play the drinking game.

215
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,264
不是喝酒 只是酒桌游戏
Not the drinking game, a drinking game.

216
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,633
说句公道话 两个你都很擅长呢
To be fair, good at both.

217
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,134
什么游戏?
What's the game?

218
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,502
好吧 名字叫做我从来没有
All right, it's called Never Have I Ever.

219
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,704
规则很简单
The rules are simple.

220
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,038
玩家说一件他们从来没干过的事
Someone says something they've never done,

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,074
其他人如果做过的话 就喝一口酒
but if you have done it, you take a drink.

222
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,241
我从来没玩过这游戏呢
I've never played that before.

223
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,276
嘿 等等
Hey, now, wait.

224
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,277
已经开始了 我需要喝一口吗?
Have we started? Do I drink?

225
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,813
- 现在什么情况?  - 好
- What is happening?  - Okay.

226
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,514
冷静一下 我先开始
Calm down. I'll go first.

227
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,016
好 让我想想
All right, let's see.

228
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,318
我从来没有...
Never have I ever...

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,687
她正在思考什么事
She's trying to think of something

230
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,688
她以前从来没干过
she's never done before.

231
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,256
这需要一点时间
This could take a while.

232
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,459
呵呵 有趣 
Very funny.

233
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,494
好 我从来没有...
Okay, never have I ever...

234
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,830
嗯 你们造吗?
Yeah, you know what?

235
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,031
还是轮下一个人吧
Let's just circle back.

236
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,766
好 让我来
Okay, I'll go.

237
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,068
我从来没有被捕过
Never have I ever been arrested.

238
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,503
那我喝
So I drink.

239
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,338
不是 你干过才喝
No, it's only if you've done it.

240
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,241
明白了
Got it.

241
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,978
你竟然被捕过我不信
I can't believe you've been arrested.

242
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,014
我不相信Penny竟然没有
I can't believe Penny hasn't.

243
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,385
Sheldon 你做了什么?
Sheldon, what did you do?

244
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,919
不是什么值得骄傲的事
Well, I'm not proud of it,

245
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,422
但... 我横穿了马路
but... I jaywalked.

246
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,357
哦 简直像恐怖片
Oh, no, it's like a horror movie.

247
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,427
我们和一个疯子一起被困在了小屋里
We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.

248
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,296
你那么做我真是太吃惊了
I'm surprised you would do that.

249
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,931
不 我横穿了马路
No, I crossed in the middle of the street.

250
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,299
正常来说 我是不会这么干的
And normally, I wouldn't,

251
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,269
但是我看到了一个面露凶相的女童军
but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout,

252
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,139
而且那会儿还是饼干的热卖季节
and it was the heart of cookie season.

253
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,574
反正 当时还有一个警察
Anyway, there was a police officer,

254
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,443
他看到了整件事
and he witnessed the whole thing.

255
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,145
他因为... 因为什么逮捕你?
What... he arrested you for that?

256
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,513
他什么都没做
No, he didn't do anything.

257
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,881
所以我跟他说 "你难道没看到我横穿马路了吗
So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk.

258
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,048
你怎么不作为呢?"
Why aren't you doing your job?"

259
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,250
懂吗?
You know?

260
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,987
"或许我可以以
"M-Maybe I should arrest you

261
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,523
你冒充警察为由逮捕你"
for-for impersonating a police officer."

262
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,958
然后你就被捕了
And then you got arrested.

263
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,460
不然你以为呢
Oh, and how.

264
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,132
我觉得自己刚刚铸成了大错
I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.

265
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,467
是的
Yeah.

266
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,635
但是从另一方面来说
But on the other hand,

267
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,103
我也没有把他赶出我们的生活啊
I didn't kick him out of our lives.

268
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,806
我只是让他退后一点
I just asked him to back off a little.

269
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,307
是的
Yeah.

270
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,910
怎么了? 你要哭了吗?
What? Are you gonna cry?

271
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,179
是啊!
Yeah!

272
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,483
是因为孕激素还是真难过啊?
Is it baby hormones or actually sad?

273
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,953
我也不知道!
I can't tell anymore!

274
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,823
我去把他找回来
I'll go get him.

275
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,393
把熊熊也带回来!
And bring back the bear!

276
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,797
这游戏太危险了
This game's dangerous.

277
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,132
我能陷你于不利
I could get you in trouble.

278
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:14,999
是吗?
How?

279
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,468
嗯 我从来没有
Well, never have I ever

280
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,571
用Sheldon的牙刷清理过下水槽
used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.

281
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,712
好啊 你想这么玩是吗?
Fine, is that how you want to play this?

282
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,014
我从来没给我的
All right, never have I ever come up

283
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,650
生殖器起过名字
with a nickname for my own genitals.

284
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,222
我就不该把Alvin和Chipmunks的事告诉你
Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.

285
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,991
好
Okay.

286
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,125
轮到我了
My turn.

287
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,127
嗯...
Um...

288
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,430
我从来没有
Never have I ever

289
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,900
在床上把女友干翻过
completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.

290
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,202
Amy啊...
Amy...

291
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,004
规则你们懂得
You know the rules.

292
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,106
喝吧
Drink.

293
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,876
嗯 喝吧
Yeah, go ahead.

294
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,313
没错就是这样
That's right.

295
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,649
好 轮到我了
All right, my turn.

296
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,650
嗯...
Mm...

297
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,285
哦 想到了
Oh, I know.

298
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,022
我从来没有因为觉得自己老婆不会管钱
Never have I ever kept a secret bank account,

299
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,325
而存过小金库
because I think my wife can't handle money.

300
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,197
我赢了吗?
Did I win?

301
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,699
感觉自己赢了呢
I feel like I won.

302
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,234
简直难以置信
I can't believe this.

303
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,970
我赚钱比你多这事你明白吗?
You realize I make more money than you?

304
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,672
我不是 我知道 但这也没什么大不了的
I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal.

305
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,974
只是我存起来的一点点积蓄嘛
It's just a little savings I put aside.

306
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,042
我们结婚了
We're married.

307
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,377
我们应该无话不谈的
We're supposed to share everything.

308
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,413
什么 你指的是 你的巨额卡债吗?
What... you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?

309
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,220
我说了
I'm calling it.

310
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,922
我赢了
I won.

311
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,459
很感谢你的道歉
I appreciate the apology,

312
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,261
但是真没必要的
but it's really not necessary.

313
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,796
是我太过分了
I overstepped my bounds.

314
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,231
不 Raj 你做得很好
No, Raj, you've been great.

315
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,500
我只是 需要开始做自己该做的事了
I just, I need to start doing my part around here.

316
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,968
我听到了哟
I hear that.

317
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,705
那如果是这样的话
Well, if that's the case,

318
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,407
我能帮你做点什么吗?
is there anything I can do to help?

319
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,042
现在也没什么
Well, not right now.

320
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,777
但我们可以先试试你买的那个麦克风
But we could try out that microphone you got us,

321
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,445
一起听听宝宝的心跳
and listen to the baby's heartbeat.

322
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,713
真的吗?
Really?

323
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,548
我可以和你们一起听吗?
It's okay if I listen with you?!

324
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,816
当然了
Of course.

325
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,820
我可以在你肚子上抹凡士林吗？
Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?

326
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,022
呵呵 看啊
Hey, look at that.

327
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,592
一秒变尴尬
It's weird again.

328
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,897
好吧 你确实
Okay, you have

329
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,998
有权利生气
every right to be mad.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,099
而且你说的没错
And what you said is true.

331
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,200
你确实比我挣得多
You do make more money than me.

332
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,635
我没有任何权利这么做
So I had no right to do what I did.

333
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,437
我很抱歉
And I'm so sorry.

334
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,038
希望你能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

335
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,240
你的小金库存了多久了?
How long have you had this secret account?

336
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,676
有几年了 但我只不过每个月存一点点
A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside

337
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,878
以备不时之需罢了
every month for emergencies.

338
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,347
你已经存了多少了?
Well, how much you got in there?

339
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,749
6427刀了
$6,427.

340
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,820
还有47分是我过生日外婆给的红包
47 cent once my nana's birthday check gets here.

341
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,588
我的天啊 Leonard 你知道
My God, Leonard, do you know

342
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,123
我能用那种钱来做什么吗?
what I could do with that kind of money?

343
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,826
我当然知道 这就是我藏起来的原因
No, I do, and that's why I hid it.

344
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,396
如果你不用的话还有什么好处呢?
What good is it if you don't use it?

345
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,999
这么说吧 你有非常喜欢但从来不穿的鞋子
Uh, uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear.

346
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,567
我有我喜欢的钱
I have money I love,

347
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,635
但我不把它花掉
but never spend.

348
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,470
这个角度上说我们还是挺配的一对呢
We're kind of a cute couple that way.

349
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,571
但还是要说
Again,

350
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,605
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,140
我不该对你隐瞒的
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

352
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,443
其实我也有自己的秘密没让你知道
Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.

353
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,045
是你的小金库吗?
Is it a secret bank account?

354
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,314
如果是的话就太完美了
Because that would be awesome.

355
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,316
我讨厌我的工作
I hate my job.

356
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,717
真的?
Really?

357
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,752
为什么?
Why?

358
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,053
因为我对为了销售
Because I don't feel good

359
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,655
和医生调情这种事很不爽
flirting with doctors for sales.

360
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:24,722
我是说 我知道这工作能挣很多钱
I mean, I know I make a lot of money.

361
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,824
但我已经很长时间不开心了
But I haven't been happy for a while.

362
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,793
你为什么不告诉我呢?
Why didn't you tell me?

363
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,328
因为我知道对你来说我有所成就是
Because I know how important it is to you

364
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,896
一件多么重要的事
that I'm having some success.

365
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,264
不是这样的
That's not true.

366
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,666
真的是这样吗? 所以你觉得我继续
Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went

367
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,701
演戏和当女服务员也没什么大不了的?
back to acting and waiting tables again?

368
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,569
如果那是你想做的话 好啊
If that's what you want to do, yes.

369
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,371
那不是我想做的
Well, it's not what I want to do.

370
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,774
吓死宝宝了
Oh, yes.

371
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,142
我想不想什么的根本无所谓
Doesn't matter what I want.

372
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,077
这份工作能让我不做卡奴
Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt.

373
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,546
所以我要成熟一点坚持走下去
So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.

374
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,916
你能这么想确实很成熟
Well, that is the grown-up thing.

375
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,384
我想是的
I guess.

376
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,720
我爱你
I love you.

377
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,322
我也爱你
I love you, too.

378
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,425
你知道吗
You know,

379
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,327
我从没有在外面下雨的时候
never have I ever made love

380
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,364
和别人在森林里野战过
in the forest while it was raining.

381
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,000
这个嘛 我得喝一杯
Well, guess I gotta drink.

382
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,841
好了 我们开始吧
All right, here we go.

383
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,680
我什么都没听到
I'm not hearing anything.

384
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,282
别着急呀
Well, give me a second.

385
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,651
你确定你行吗?
Are you sure you can do this?

386
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,086
嘿 别忘了是谁用他的金属探测器在
Hey, who found four dollars and change

387
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,389
沙滩上找到四美元和零钱的
on the beach with his metal detector?

388
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,559
是我埋在那里的 这样我们才能回家
I buried it there, so we could go home.

389
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,966
等等 找到了
Wait, that's it.

390
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,434
哇
Wow.

391
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,372
这是不是天底下最棒的了?
Isn't that the best?

392
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,242
你俩造了个人啊
You guys made a person.

393
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,916
是啊
We did.

394
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,919
我觉得这其中少不了我的帮助呢
And I like to think I helped.

395
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,625
没你啥事
You didn't.

396
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,945
让我想想
Oh, let me see.

397
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,715

先在食物上撒盐
without trying it first.

411

谁会啊...
Yeah...

412
