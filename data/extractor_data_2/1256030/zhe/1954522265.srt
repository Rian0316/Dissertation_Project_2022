Renaissance Fair
{\a6}美国很多地方举办的
重现文艺复兴时期场景的庆典活动

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,860
Please let it go, Sheldon.
别再说了 Sheldon

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,920
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
到处充斥着历史错误

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,020
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.
比如 小酒馆的女服务生
售卖大肚壶的蜂蜜酒

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,090
Her costume was obviously Germanic.
她的装束明显是德国人

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,420
But in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or "Reinheitsgebot,"
但在1487年 纯净酿酒法
或曰"德国啤酒纯正法"

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,160
severely limited the
availability of mead.
严格限制加制蜂蜜酒

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,160
*****
{\a6}该法明定啤酒的酿造原料 尤其不得添加人工酒精

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,430
At best, they would have
had some sort of spiced wine.

Oh, really?
哦 是么?

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,150
Well, here's another nit for you: the flagons
would not have been made of polypropylene.
再告诉你个错误
大肚酒壶不该是聚丙烯做的

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,270
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.
文艺复兴节关注的不是历史错误

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,090
They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's
而是让那些在金考公司上班的圆胖女孩

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,630
and lacing them up in corsets so tight
their bosom jumps out and says, "Howdy."
用带子把腹部束得紧紧的以致
乳房鼓得快跳脱出来 然后说"您好"

Bosoms would not have said
"howdy" in the 15th century.
15世纪的大胸女人可不会说"您好"

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,250
If anything, they
would've said, "Huzzah."
说的话也该是 "啊赞!"

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,280
I don't care what the
bosoms say, Sheldon.
我不在乎大胸女人说什么 Sheldon

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,300
I just want to be part
of the conversation.
我只想和她们搭上话

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,090

Besides, what's the big deal?
再说 有啥大不了滴?

We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.
我们约会过 然后不约会了
现在我们都朝前看了

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,820
KOOTHRAPPALI: By moving on, do you
mean she's going out with other men
你指的朝前看是她和另个男的出去约会

41
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,980
and you spent the afternoon making
15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
而你花一下午和Wolowitz一起
做15世纪的肥皂?

42
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,610
That was not 15th century soap.
那才不是15世纪的肥皂

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,640
My God, those people need to
learn you can't just put "ye olde"
天啊 这些人该懂得不能什么
都胡乱加上前缀"ye olde"（古英语：老）

in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,580
Hey, Sheldon.
嘿 Sheldon

277
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,600
Penny.
Penny

278
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,510
Third floor tonight--
mixing it up?
今晚坐三楼哈 吵架了?

279
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,390
I still don't understand why you
don't just go to dinner or something.
我还是不明白你为啥不去吃个饭之类的

280
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,310
All right, let's say I go to dinner alone, and
during the meal, I have to use the restroom.
好吧 就说我一个人去吃饭吧
在用餐期间 我肯定得去洗手间

281
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,640
How do I know someone's
not touching my food?
我怎么知道别人没碰过我的食物?

282
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,020
Good night, Sheldon.
晚安 Sheldon

283
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,360
Penny, hold on.
Penny 等等

284
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,300
Are you sure things can't
work out with you and Leonard?
你肯定你和Leonard没可能了?

285
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,330
Excuse me?
什么?

286
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,250
I'm just wondering if you really
gave it the old college try.
我只是想知道你会不会努力试试
(这里是个双关语 也指Penny试着去念大学)

287
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,540
Or in your case, the old
community college try.
放在你身上 就是去社区学院试试

288
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,160
Okay, where is this coming from?
干嘛要提起这个?

289
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,670
Leonard is upstairs right
now with my archenemy.
Leonard和我的宿敌在楼上

290
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,880
Your archenemy?
你的宿敌?

291
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,280
Yes, the Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.
没错 就像毁灭博士对我的神奇先生

292
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,680
Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man, the
Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
章鱼博士对我的蜘蛛侠
Sivana博士对我的神奇队长

293
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,350
I get it, I get it, I get it.
明白了 明白了

294
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,400
Do you know, it's amazing how many
supervillains have advanced degrees.
真是奇妙 这些超级大坏蛋都有很高的学历

295
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,980
Graduate school should probably do a
better job of screening those people out.
研究生院该好好做做工作把他们筛选出嘛

296
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,890
Sheldon, come back. You're losing me.
Sheldon 快说正题 你把我弄晕了

297
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,860
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
Penny 我说的是Leslie Winkle

298
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,790
She belittles my research.
她鄙视我的研究

299
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,160
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
噢 小可爱 我很抱歉

300
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,120
She called me "dumbass."
她叫我"傻蛋"

301
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,800
I know. I heard.
我知道 我听见了

302
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,830
Given this situation, I have no choice
but to withdraw my previous objections
在这种情况下 我不得不收回之前

303
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,550
to your ill-considered
relationship with Leonard.
对你和Leonard欠考虑关系的反对

304
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,690
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.
噢 谢谢你这么做

305
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,060
But I think for now, Leonard and
I are just gonna stay friends.
不过就现在而言
Leonard和我还是做朋友比较好

306
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,340
No, that response is unacceptable to me.
不行 这个回答我无法接受

307
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,160
Sheldon, you are a smart guy.
Sheldon 你是个聪明人

308
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,680
- You must know...
- I'm "smart"?
- 你得知道
- 我是"聪明人"?

309
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,480
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."
要被归为"聪明人" 我得去掉60点智商才行

310
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,380
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.
- 你还让不让我说了?
- 对不起

311
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,090
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to
be together, nothing you can do is gonna stop it.
你得知道要是Leonard和Leslie要在一起的话
你做什么都是阻止不了的

312
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,960
You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.
小姐 你再次低估了我的能力

313
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,560
Okay, let me put it this way.
好 这么说吧

314
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,170
If you're really Leonard's friend, you will
support him no matter who he wants to be with.
如果你真是Leonard的哥们
无论他和谁在一起你都会支持他的

315
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,350
Wait a minute.
等一下

316
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,290
Why am I doing all the giving here?
为什么我要他们让地儿?

317
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,500
If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he
have to support me an my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
如果Leonard真的是我的哥们
他怎么就不支持一下我对Leslie Winkle的厌恶之情?

318
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,560
Because love trumps hate.
因为爱胜过厌恶

319
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,010
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.
噢 你可真会胡说

320
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,920
Okay, good night, Sheldon.
好吧 晚安了 Sheldon

321
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,130
Oh, Mario, if only I could control
everyone the way I control you.
玛丽啊
要是我能像控制你一样控制他人该多好

322
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,120
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
跳啊 你个小水管工 跳 跳 跳

323
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,920
When the two of you reach a natural
stopping point, I'd like to have a word.
等你们自然地结束以后 我有话要说

324
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,720
The word is "pee-pee." Just do it.
要是你要说"尿尿" 去就是了

325
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,540
Leonard, you're my friend, and friends
support their friends... apparently.
Leonard 你是我朋友
朋友互相支持 那是显然的

326
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,760
So I'm withdrawing my objection to your
desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
所以我收回对你和Leslie交往的反对

327
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,050
Thank you.
谢谢

328
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,560
I will graciously overlook the fact
that she is an arrogant, subpar scientist
我会和蔼地远眺这位傲慢而不合格的科学家

329
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,080
who actually believes loop quantum
gravity better unites quantum mechanics
实际上她相信环量子引力更好地联系起
量子力学和广义相对论

330
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,370
with generally relativity
than does string theory.
而不是弦理论

331
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,340
You kids have fun.
你们自娱自乐吧

332
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,170
Hang on a second.
等等

333
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,330
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.
环量子引力明显比弦理论提供了更多可证的预测

334
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm listening. Amuse me.
我在听呢 逗我笑吧

335
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,290
Okay, well, for one thing, we expect
quantized space-time to manifest itself
好 一方面来说
我们期待量子化的时空能够证明

336
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,030
as minute differences in the speed
of light for different colors.
在光速下不同颜色的细小差异

337
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,120
Balderdash. Matter clearly
consists of tiny strings.
胡言乱语 物质显然是由细小的弦组成的

338
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,310
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?
他这么同我说话 你就坐视不理?

339
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,570
Okay, well, there is a lot
of merit to both theories.
好吧 两种理论各有各的优势

340
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,380
No, there isn't.
不是这样的

341
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,230
Only loop quantum gravity calculates
the entropy of black holes.
只有环量子引力能算出黑洞的熵值

342
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,710
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
Sheldon 别发出那种声音

343
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,020
It's disrespectful.
太不尊重人了

344
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,920
I should hope so. It
was a snort of derision.
我正是这么想的 那是嘲笑的鼻息声

345
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,820
You agree with me, right?
你同意我的 对吧?

346
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,110
Loop quantum gravity is
the future of physics.
环量子引力是物理学的未来

347
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,240
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.
抱歉 Leslie
我比较同意弦理论 而不是环理论

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm glad I found out the truth about
you before this went any further.
我很高兴能在我们的关系有进展前看到了真相

349
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,020
Truth? What truth?
真相? 什么真相?

350
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,340
We're talking about untested
hypotheses. It's no big deal.
我们在讨论未经证实的假说 有什么大不了的

351
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,520
It isn't? Really?
没什么大不了的? 真的?

352
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,650
Tell me, Leonard, how
will we raise the children?
Leonard 告诉我 我们怎么教育我们的孩子

353
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,300
I...
我...

354
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,810
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.
我猜我们会等他们长大了自己选吧

355
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,930
We can't let them choose,
Leonard. They're children!
怎么能让他们自己选 他们是孩子!

356
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,880
Wait. Where are you going?
等等 你上哪儿去?

357
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,290
I'm sorry.
对不起

358
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,950
I could have accepted our
kids being genetically unable
就遗传角度而言 我们的孩子不能吃冷饮
也没法在游行时看得更远

359
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,590
to eat ice cream or ever
get a good view of a parade.
这些我还都能接受

360
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,910
But this?
但是这个?

361
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,520
This is a deal breaker.
这毁了我们的约定

362
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,130
Look on the bright side.
凡事总有两面

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,560
What's the bright side?
哪有好的一面?

364
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,480
Only nine more months to Comic-con.
离Comic-con动漫展只有九个月了

365
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh, yeah.
噢 是啊

366
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,830
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.
队长 发现异常情况

367
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,260
Yeah, that's great.
那很好啊

368
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,570
- You guys want a corn dog?
- Yeah.
- 你们要来根玉米肠么?
- 好啊

369
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,680
That's a temporal anomaly.
时间异常

370
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,060
Corn dog's didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.
玉米肠是二十世纪中叶才出现的
