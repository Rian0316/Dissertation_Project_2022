1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,657
- Previously, on The Originals...
- You're a wolf. Why aren't you healing?

2
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:04,882
A monster is still a
biological organism.

3
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:06,634
- So, I devised a treatment.
- If you found

4
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:07,903
a way to weaken yourself,

5
00:00:07,906 --> 00:00:09,206
maybe you can

6
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,828
help me find a way
to kill Marcel Gerard.

7
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:12,531
Maxine. It's Adam.

8
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,979
He never came home.

9
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,501
Adam Folsom was your only case.

10
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:18,349
We got three additional
reports of missing kids.

11
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,684
Eight years ago, you were running

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,052
this city with an iron fist.

13
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,653
I start looking for forms of magic

14
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,221
that you can't defend against.

15
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,423
Sacrificial magic.

16
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,824
You freed it, Vincent.

17
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,793
And now, it must be fed.

18
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,261
I'm so cold.

19
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,264
That witch, he used their personal items

20
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,465
to bind them to the spell.

21
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,467
Hope Mikaelson is linked to that spell.

22
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,502
She's gonna die. We got
to cast a cleansing spell

23
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,071
on New Orleans soil.

24
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,706
Paramedics took the kids

25
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,391
to the hospital to
get checked out.

26
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,942
NOLA PD will notify the parents.

27
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,621
Hell of a sight.

28
00:00:57,623 --> 00:01:00,491
Powerful man overlooking his city.

29
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,930
I wonder if I could convince
you to change your view?

30
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,500
Oh, not that you aren't
stunning, 'cause you are,

31
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,836
I'm just, um...

32
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,205
I'm having trouble shaking
off the day that I had.

33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,374
So...

34
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,844
you're saying you
could use a distraction?

35
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,046
Allow me to distract.

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,418
Mm.

37
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:32,911
Just ignore it.

38
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:35,993
No, just one second.

39
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,363
Yeah. All right.

40
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,933
Come in...

41
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,341
Marcel, we got a problem.

42
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,321
Those kids. They never made it home.

43
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,179
What are you talking
about? I loaded those kids

44
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,480
into the ambulance myself.

45
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:59,216
The ambulance is missing too.

46
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,142
The children are sedated.

47
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,299
I've already prepared them.

48
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,369
For the rich'll.

49
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,150
A token of our master's power.

50
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,053
You'll need it for what's to come.

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,324
Just one last thing.

52
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,792
Your friend.

53
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,327
Vincent Griffith.

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,896
I won't let anything stop us.

55
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,699
Our home.

56
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,135
Once the pride of our
family, now a flophouse.

57
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,770
Indeed, the mighty have fallen.

58
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,771
Where's Vincent?

59
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,906
Right here.

60
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,254
Kept my word.

61
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,157
Now the only question is whether or not

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,079
you guys are gonna keep
yours. As soon as I'm finished

63
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,295
healing your kid, you
got to leave the city.

64
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,882
Well, we're not gonna stay, are we?

65
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,784
Your city has lost its charm.

66
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,154
What he means to say is that
we're very grateful, just...

67
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,489
help her and we'll leave.

68
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,424
Just give us what we need,

69
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,259
and we will do so, happily.

70
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,927
Excuse me.

71
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,865
Okay...

72
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,270
Nettoyer timoun sa a.

73
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,341
Nettoyer timoun.

74
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,612
Nettoyer timoun sa a.

75
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,681
Nettoyer...

76
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,457
Oh...

77
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,725
Mom?

78
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,994
- That's it.
- Oh!

79
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,863
- Your little girl's purified.
- Thank you.

80
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,099
Now look, the only gratitude
I need from any of you

81
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,834
is seeing you leave the city.

82
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,274
Go see your daddy.

83
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,686
What is this?

84
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,720
I don't know.

85
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,991
Mom?

86
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,694
Can you hear that?

87
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,062
It's...

88
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,630
whispers.

89
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,299
Saying a name.

90
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,668
Over and over.

91
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,304
Kre Nah Han...

92
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,706
Kre Nah Han...

93
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,408
Vincent, what...

94
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,776
what is that?

95
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,646
It's a nearly forgotten dialect.

96
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,248
It's Creole.

97
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,984
It means the Hollow.

98
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,253
The Hollow is coming.

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,887
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

100
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,739
How is she?

101
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,041
Uh, the fever's back.

102
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,309
But she's not in any pain.

103
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,346
- She's asking for you.
- Well, make an excuse.

104
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,922
I'd rather my daughter not know
I've gone off to murder witches.

105
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,951
- We can not be reckless, Niklaus.
- And how would you have me respond?

106
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,109
Should I delegate my child's
safety to someone else?

107
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,755
Let me see what I can do.

108
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,857
And I will handle
Marcel. Out of the three of us,

109
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,593
I win Most Likely Not
to Get Killed on Arrival.

110
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,462
Whatever we're up against,

111
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,380
it's as much his problem as is it ours.

112
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,965
Leaving me to do what, exactly?

113
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,935
Stay here and protect our daughter.

114
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,103
Do not let anything

115
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,571
or anyone near her.

116
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,074
A word of warning.

117
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,143
The Marcel that you knew is gone.

118
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,512
So, whatever he is now,

119
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,047
he's no ally.

120
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,995
Mm. Oh, I guess I feel asleep working.

121
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,697
Did you get any?

122
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,400
I just woke up from a five-year nap.

123
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,336
You going somewhere?

124
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,705
New Orleans. Hope is still sick.

125
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,807
Klaus asked me to see what I can do.

126
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,177
Great, um... So long as you're
stepping into a war zone,

127
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,080
see if you can't get your
hands on Marcel's venom.

128
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,250
Klaus did say that
Marcel would be occupied.

129
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,686
We can enter his home,

130
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,521
steal whatever we need,

131
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,502
- and leave before anyone notices.
- Okay.

132
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,984
You want me to help you
rob the most deadly vampire

133
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,126
on the planet?

134
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,362
I will pass.

135
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,230
If you're worried about a fight...

136
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,500
allow me to even the odds.

137
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,339
The stone is kyanite.

138
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,408
It's been spelled to
grant you total control

139
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,676
of your werewolf nature,

140
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,244
even during a full moon.

141
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,716
This is a cure.

142
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,351
It's everything I've ever wanted.

143
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,556
What's the catch?

144
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,025
Not a catch.

145
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,727
Insurance.

146
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,197
Yeah.

147
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,866
More like a leash,

148
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,534
spelled so that I can't take it off.

149
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,902
Like you said.

150
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,671
It's everything you ever wanted.

151
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,607
Provided you help me.

152
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,252
How are you feeling?

153
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,387
I'm still so cold.

154
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,325
Are the birds gone?

155
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,094
Yeah. They're gone, sweetheart.

156
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,597
And when you're better,

157
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,966
which will be soon,

158
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,535
you and I are going to
share the biggest plate

159
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,537
of beignets you've ever seen.

160
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,373
And you can tell me where
in this big, wide world

161
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,076
you'd like me to take you next.

162
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,546
Mom said you loved New
Orleans most of all.

163
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,984
I did, once.

164
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,388
But putting your love
in a place is a mistake.

165
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,192
Being here in our home,

166
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,295
seeing these walls,

167
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,064
I am reminded that it is people

168
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,967
who are best suited to fill our hearts.

169
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,304
Dad.

170
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,340
I don't feel so good.

171
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:38,982
Look, guys. I know
what we're up against.

172
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,598
There's a faction of
our own people, witches.

173
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,545
They've started to make
human sacrifices to a spirit

174
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,022
called the Hollow.

175
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,825
Now, this thing is dark,

176
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,526
it's angry,

177
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,761
it's very powerful.

178
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,930
It is a force my family and I

179
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,498
are here to erase.

180
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,402
- Does not!
- Now,

181
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,839
kindly excuse us, please.

182
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,142
Mr. Griffith and I have much to discuss.

183
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,644
Okay, uh...

184
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,379
Give me a minute.

185
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,741
So, now that we've dispensed
with the needless hysteria...

186
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:18,288
I got a lot on my plate, Elijah,

187
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,190
without whatever trouble
you're trying to bring my way.

188
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,345
You need me.

189
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:23,460
And fortunately, I have a long history

190
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,863
of removing anything
undesirable from New Orleans.

191
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,859
I'm probably one of the
things that's on your list.

192
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,632
So I reckon it's best for me work alone.

193
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,034
Oh, it's not an offer.

194
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,603
Children's lives are at risk.

195
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,571
You care about children's lives at risk?

196
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,074
What about Davina Claire, Elijah?

197
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,243
So, you can only see me as some kind

198
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,278
- of merciless butcher.
- Yes.

199
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,537
- I do.
- I'll be whatever you

200
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,181
want me to be, Vincent Griffith.

201
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,251
I'll be the very devil
himself, but make no mistake,

202
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,720
I would violate everything
sacred under the sun

203
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,755
in the name of rescuing my niece.

204
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,824
And right now, according to you...

205
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,792
you are facing two evils.

206
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:59,496
Wouldn't it be nice to have
one of those by your side?

207
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,533
We're gonna do this my way.

208
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,168
Beautiful.

209
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,104
Your way it is.

210
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:19,809
Listen up.

211
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,549
Listen up.

212
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,886
For five years now, we've had a truce.

213
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,888
Stayed out of each other's business.

214
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,957
Tended to our own.

215
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,128
But now, your problems
are becoming mine.

216
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,298
Someone is taking children.

217
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,334
As you know, I have one

218
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,402
nonnegotiable rule:

219
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:44,405
we do not mess with kids.

220
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,140
Now, you've seen that graffiti.

221
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,313
Someone here's got to
know who's responsible.

222
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,882
Right?

223
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,385
So just give me a name. Hmm?

224
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,952
We don't owe you anything.

225
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:02,290
You're no friend to witches.

226
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,726
You don't trust him.

227
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,597
I get it.

228
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:12,066
But one of those kids is my daughter.

229
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,468
She's seven.

230
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,070
She likes to paint, catch fireflies,

231
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,505
make up stories.

232
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,173
All I know is that she's sick.

233
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,676
Right now, I don't care about the past.

234
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm just a mom

235
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:27,515
asking you to help me.

236
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,860
There's a girl named Lara.

237
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,230
I saw her draw

238
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,965
the same symbol on her window in blood.

239
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,901
Where do I find this witch?

240
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,370
She's not a witch.

241
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,407
She's one of your kind.

242
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,608
A wolf.

243
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,179
She ran off to the bayou.

244
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,457
Nice job on the lock.

245
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,292
You'd make a good cat burglar.

246
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,429
All magic is just opening
locks and finding loopholes.

247
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:18,433
So tell me again: why don't
you just tell your family

248
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,501
about our little secret project?

249
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:23,938
They're overly sensitive
when it comes to Marcel.

250
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,373
Oh, not you, though, huh?

251
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,175
The merciless badass

252
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,110
who doesn't get
sentimental about anyone.

253
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,813
Somebody's got to be the big sister.

254
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:32,667
Okay.

255
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,350
Since you are so in love with
taking charge, where do we look?

256
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,485
Marcel stockpiled Klaus' blood.

257
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:39,320
No doubt he did the same with his venom.

258
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,625
He would keep that someplace safe.

259
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,426
You know, that ring

260
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,061
enhances your instincts.

261
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,396
Why not try using them?

262
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,432
Sorry, I don't do bloodhound.

263
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,468
Fine, we'll do it my way.

264
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,147
And who might this be?

265
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,782
These are the ashes

266
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:10,918
of a witch that lost his way

267
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,287
and it might just be the
key to helping us find ours.

268
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,623
This thing, um,

269
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,091
the Hollow...

270
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,960
its magic has a very unique signature.

271
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,795
I felt it on this witch the other day

272
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,397
when Marcel and I took him out,

273
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,465
so if I can trace that
energy back to its source...

274
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,267
You can find the rest of these fanatics.

275
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,072
So this thing which haunts my niece...

276
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:33,641
has it spoken to you?

277
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,279
It's more like, um, a broadcast.

278
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,747
And I was able to shut it out,

279
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:42,150
but a lot of people have
a harder time doing that.

280
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:44,052
Like your wife.

281
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:49,090
You know, there's a difference
between what we project

282
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,793
and what we have inside of our hearts,

283
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,796
what we try to hide inside
of our hearts, right?

284
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:57,065
Now that thing, it took everything

285
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,725
that's dark and twisted inside
of me and it used it against me.

286
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,828
It used it again my wife
and it ended up taking

287
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,404
everything that I've
ever loved away from me.

288
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,429
So, then, you have every reason

289
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,541
- to want to remove it from this earth.
- Yeah.

290
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,009
But let's say that we run into

291
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:09,310
that thing today, Elijah.

292
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:11,300
It's gonna take everything

293
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,702
that you want to keep buried,

294
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:13,800
it's going to use that

295
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,168
and make you do exactly
what it wants you to do.

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,567
And that's what makes you a liability

297
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:22,202
to the very niece that
we're both trying to protect.

298
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,473
Let's get to work.

299
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:28,776
That man, Vincent...

300
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,611
Mom said he was a witch.

301
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,780
That he came to help me feel better.

302
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,549
But I feel worse.

303
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,818
I know. I know.

304
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,186
But don't worry,

305
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,621
because as we speak,

306
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:42,957
your mother and your Uncle Elijah

307
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,092
are working with Vincent to fix you up.

308
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,394
So you just stay calm

309
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,229
and they'll make everything all right.

310
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,233
Do you know what it is?

311
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,501
The Hollow?

312
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:57,972
No, sweetheart...

313
00:14:57,974 --> 00:14:59,506
I don't.

314
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:02,242
It wants those other
kids. I can feel them.

315
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,479
I think it wants me, too.

316
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,915
I am not gonna let anything take you.

317
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,584
I promise you that.

318
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:13,253
I'm going to keep you safe,

319
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:16,624
always and forever.

320
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:23,263
Chèche in virtute.

321
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,600
Chèche in virtute,
chèche in virtute.

322
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,305
Chèche in virtute.

323
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,045
What is it?

324
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,147
Vincent, what did you see?

325
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,858
How is she?

326
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,521
She's sleeping.

327
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:49,023
Freya will be here soon

328
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,225
to stir up one of her
medicinal concoctions.

329
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:52,760
Tell me you have answers.

330
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,495
Marcel and I have a lead.

331
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:57,297
A wolf who got caught
up with the Hollow.

332
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,592
A wolf involved in witch business?

333
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:00,768
Crazy, I know.

334
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,870
I want to ask her a few questions.

335
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,439
Well, regardless of her
excuses or your loyalties,

336
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:08,842
I expect you to show this
traitor the error of her ways.

337
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,644
I'll handle it.

338
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,441
She's not gonna want
to talk to a vampire.

339
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:15,582
- I'll go.
- The thing is,

340
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,985
the last time I came across
one of the Hollow's goons,

341
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,454
the guy tried to kill
me, so... fair warning.

342
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,633
Lara?

343
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,501
My name's Hayley. I don't know if...

344
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,503
I know who you are.

345
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,372
Hayley Marshall.

346
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,811
I know why you're here.

347
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:49,650
You're here because of the children.

348
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:55,656
I am.

350
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,392
They're as good as dead.

351
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,732
Weird time to have a drink, bud.

352
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,757
Should be out looking for those kids.

353
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,225
Yeah.

354
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,563
I'm a little upside-down, Will.

355
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:37,998
I got this, um,

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,568
evil mojo just breathing down my back.

357
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,773
And it's the same thing
that took out my wife...

358
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,509
then it took me out...

359
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:51,044
and now I think it's trying
to take out my best friend.

360
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,914
Was this your plan, Vince?

361
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,416
Invite me here,

362
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,618
confront me?

363
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,586
Whatever this thing promised you,

364
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,855
- it's not gonna deliver.
- You're wrong.

365
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:04,391
The Hollow rewards those who are loyal.

366
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:06,586
Maybe if you did what
it asked you to do,

367
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,755
things might be different.

368
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,897
For me. For Cami.

369
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,231
For all of us.

370
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,544
Is that what it told you, Will?

371
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:15,269
That's what it showed me,
Vince. Look at this city!

372
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,172
It's overrun with evil.

373
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:19,740
And the only way to take it back

374
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:22,543
is to do one little evil thing myself.

375
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,610
This is not what you are!

376
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:24,845
You can walk away from this.

377
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:26,480
I can help you walk away from this.

378
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:27,915
You can't help me.

379
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,318
You can't even help yourself.

380
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,953
Don't you see?

381
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:34,955
You're in the middle of
everything that's to come.

382
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:37,958
Which is why they sent me here, Vince.

383
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,327
For you.

384
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,711
That's quite the monster
you got lurking in there.

385
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,219
You want to see mine?

386
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,017
I know you can hear me.

387
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,787
I want you to listen.

388
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:14,057
The heart which beats in your chest

389
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,261
is a warrior's heart.

390
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,463
The heart of a Mikaelson.

391
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,547
Whatever hold this power has over you,

392
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:27,317
it is nothing compared to your strength.

393
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,987
Yours is a power greater than you know.

394
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,361
Come on.

395
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,065
Hope...

396
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:59,950
Dad?

397
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:05,388
I saw them. The other kids.

398
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,906
They're so scared.

399
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,096
Promise me

400
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:16,266
if you ever see the blue lights,

401
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:18,635
don't look at them.

402
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,042
I can't open it, which means this is

403
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,589
exactly what we were looking for.

404
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:40,956
Well, before you blow it
open with a magic bomb,

405
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,277
just keep in mind that they're
gonna know that we were here.

406
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,761
Well, do you have a better idea?

407
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,029
Because my family needs me.

408
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,264
- And I'm out of time for this.
- Go help your niece.

409
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,867
I've got super-duper wolf hearing.

410
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:53,236
I will crack the safe and if
there's anything that we can use,

411
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,271
- I'll grab it.
- Keelin, if you try to run....

412
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:58,141
I know. You'll make me turn all hairy.

413
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,909
I got the threat the first time.

414
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,517
You just go. Help your family.

415
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,453
I'll meet you wherever you tell me to.

416
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:15,545
All right, someone cast
a spell to block his mind

417
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:16,873
against your vampire tricks, all right?

418
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,307
I can break that, Elijah,

419
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,976
it's just gonna take
me a little bit of time

420
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,699
- That's a luxury we don't have.
- Look, Elijah,

421
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,746
I'm not gonna let you
torture him, all right?

422
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,409
He's my friend and he's
just as much of a victim

423
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:26,610
as all those kids.

424
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,922
You have five minutes.

425
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,359
We're not here to hurt you.

426
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,627
You can't hurt me any more

427
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,796
than I've already hurt myself.

428
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,633
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

429
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,702
I didn't know they were gonna

430
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,038
- bring children into it.
- It's okay.

431
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,507
Just tell us who "they" are.

432
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:54,477
Those that serve the Hollow.

433
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,046
Followers of the blue light.

434
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,415
I thought we were doing something good.

435
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,250
Trying to take back our city.

436
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:02,452
Back from what?

437
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,988
From him.

438
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,358
From the vampires.

439
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,762
For five years we kept quiet.

440
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,998
Watching you lord over
this city like it was yours.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,434
Hey, I spent the last five
years keeping the peace...

442
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,504
It is not your city to rule!

443
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,340
New Orleans belongs to all of us.

444
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:29,712
And the Hollow offered
us the power we needed.

445
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,515
So long as we pledged our allegiance.

446
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,953
But Lara, you're a Crescent.

447
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,765
You have the pack, you
don't need this cult.

448
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,120
You were gone.

449
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:40,089
You chose the Original Family

450
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,858
over your own kind.

451
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,759
Don't you see?

452
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:46,395
Our pack means nothing.

453
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,130
You mean nothing!

454
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,465
You're right.

455
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,901
I wasn't there.

456
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,569
But I have a daughter now.

457
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,272
And, Lara, she's one of the kids.

458
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,141
She's one of the kids that's in danger.

459
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:01,143
So, please,

460
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,845
help us help them.

461
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,519
You can't help them.

462
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,622
The Hollow wants power.

463
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,625
The kind that only comes from sacrifice.

464
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:20,830
Those kids will die
so it can get stronger.

465
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,801
And it will feed.

466
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,795
And it will rise.

467
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,474
And we will all bow before it.

468
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,043
The great beast.

469
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,647
Even you.

470
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,552
My only mercy is I
won't be here to see it.

471
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,495
Briser...

472
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,698
Briser le bouchlier.

473
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,136
Briser le bouchlier.
Briser le bouchlier.

474
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,305
- Briser le bouchlier.
- Time's up.

475
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,860
- Hold on, Elijah!
- Why do you insist?

476
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:07,242
Because he's my friend.
And because a witch

477
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,978
told me that I'm the one
that gave this thing breath.

478
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,113
Now I don't know what I did
to let it into this world,

479
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:14,417
but I know I ain't just
gonna let it take him out.

480
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,386
Finish it.

481
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:22,091
Marquer nonm sa a.

482
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,460
Marquer nonm sa a.

483
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,404
There's no going back, Vince.

484
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,983
Any other wonderful ideas?

485
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,453
I tagged him with magic,
so now we can trace him.

486
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,489
Right back to the kids.

487
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,224
Let's go.

488
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,393
Oh...

489
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah...

490
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:10,387
Assume you told everybody
to be on their best behavior?

491
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:12,089
Oh, I told them.

492
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:13,657
Now whether or not they'll be obedient

493
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,994
is another thing altogether.

494
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:19,263
- Where's Hope?
- Freya's with her now.

495
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:22,099
She's fighting it. Whatever it is.

496
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,867
The kids are attached to that
spell: if we save the kids,

497
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,135
we save your little girl.

498
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,304
And the sooner you all

499
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:28,305
can be on your way.

500
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,040
Clearly,

501
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,643
we're skipping all the
hugs and hellos. Vincent?

502
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:35,340
Trail leads off this way, so, I guess

503
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:36,743
we, uh, follow the breadcrumbs.

504
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:39,083
Tactless savages holding
a ghost-raising rave.

505
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,317
Best make short work of them.

506
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,152
- I say we...
- We split up.

507
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:44,655
Klaus, you're with me, I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

508
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,123
Anybody got a problem with that...

509
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:49,793
I don't give a damn.

510
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,833
I assume you embark upon this
journey out of the kindness

511
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,894
- of your heart?
- There are kids in trouble.

512
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:59,030
Yours included.

513
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:01,105
It's a bit late for you to
suddenly care about my child,

514
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,929
given you left her
fatherless for five years.

515
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:04,198
Well, speaking from experience,

516
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,368
I figured I was doing her a favor.

517
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:07,411
Careful.

518
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,543
Lest your insults mar an
already tentative peace.

519
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,582
All right, listen, I don't
care about our peace, all right?

520
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,183
I care about finding these missing kids

521
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,819
and wiping out the messed
up people who took them.

522
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:18,322
Root out the problems,
make them go away.

523
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:20,157
That's what you do when you're the king.

524
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,159
All I see is a petulant prince.

525
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:23,894
Always with the insults.
You never do learn.

526
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,362
On the contrary.

527
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:27,631
My time in your dungeon
clarified my priorities.

528
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,966
My concerns are with my child.

529
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:30,096
And as for you,

530
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,832
I can imagine no better revenge

531
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,270
than leaving you to the endless struggle

532
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:35,005
to prove yourself my better.

533
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:36,604
You're welcome, by the way.

534
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:38,242
So you knew this Crescent girl?

535
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,836
I did.

536
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,139
But whatever that was
today, that wasn't her.

537
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,715
She said something about blue light.

538
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,250
Yeah, that's the Fifolet.

539
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,051
New Orleans legend
says that a spirit might

540
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,454
present itself in a
bright blue ball of light.

541
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:51,722
Wonderful.

542
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,023
How do we kill it?

543
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,159
We'll find out soon enough.

544
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,805
Now that you've returned, brother,

545
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:45,609
you may join us as we claim our power.

546
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,312
Our rightful place.

547
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:51,081
And lay waste to all who
would deny our master.

548
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,314
Are you prepared to prove your loyalty

549
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:00,856
- to the Hollow?
- I know

550
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,026
what I have to do. I'm not afraid.

551
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:08,165
We should begin.

552
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:13,370
Enough with this circus of sadists.

553
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:30,754
Hey, we got to get
the kids. Get the kids!

554
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:37,127
Okay, here.

555
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,899
Vinculum mond sa.

556
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,124
Vinculum mond sa.

557
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:46,837
Will? Will!

558
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,305
Come on, man.

559
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,407
- It's over.
- No, Vince.

560
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,109
It's only just begun.

561
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:06,021
You can't stop what's coming.

562
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,926
No!

563
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:33,150
Oh, man, we got this all wrong.

564
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:34,484
They wanted us here.

565
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:35,819
Why?

566
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,254
They want to channel your power,

567
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,656
and anchor the Hollow
to the living world.

568
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:53,370
Okay, they're alive.

569
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:54,938
These kids

570
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,785
are linked to that ritual.

571
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:59,609
We can't free Marcel and Klaus

572
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,278
unless we break the spell.

573
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,546
How do we stop this?

574
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:04,106
I don't know!

575
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,849
It's a sacrificial ritual.

576
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:06,950
I can't break it

577
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,185
unless I kill one of the kids.

578
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:10,111
No, no.

579
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:11,722
There has to be another way.

580
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:24,501
Where are we?

581
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:33,043
Don't look into the blue light.

582
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:35,699
Yeah, um...

583
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:37,879
so these kids are powering that ritual.

584
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:39,403
But there might be a loophole,

585
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,418
if I link it to you.

586
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,887
Are you suggesting we take my life?

587
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:44,817
I'm suggesting

588
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,423
we stake you with wood.

589
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,691
You die,

590
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:48,859
temporarily,

591
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,761
and that might be enough to

592
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:52,562
break the spell.

593
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,366
What is this?

594
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,689
Shut your eyes.

595
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:11,415
Mare.

596
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,650
Mare leurs.

597
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:16,553
Mare leurs esprits.

598
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:25,295
Mare leurs esprits!

599
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,964
Mare leurs esprits!

600
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,867
Mare leurs esprits!

601
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,703
Mare leurs esprits!

602
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,264
Look away!

603
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,414
Hayley, do it now!

604
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,342
Did it work?

605
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,992
Hope.

606
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,290
We're not cold anymore.

607
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,231
Come back for one last look?

608
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,301
This place...

609
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,104
this city...

610
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:19,406
a lot of tragedy happened here.

611
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,575
A lot I regret.

612
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:23,744
But Hope was born here.

613
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:25,579
So there was good

614
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:27,581
with all that bad.

615
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:34,621
After everything that's happened,

616
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:36,490
the city is yours.

617
00:33:39,341 --> 00:33:41,574
I hope it brings you peace.

618
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,314
Good-bye, Marcel.

619
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:52,819
Do one thing for me.

620
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,659
Tell your daughter

621
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,589
she doesn't need to fear me.

622
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:58,758
She never did.

623
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:18,244
Glad you showed up.

624
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,080
It's not like I had much of a choice.

625
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:21,715
Keelin...

626
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:23,817
- You have to understand....
- Look,

627
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:26,152
maybe you and yours

628
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:27,487
do it differently, but...

629
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:29,956
where I'm from,

630
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,491
you make a deal, you keep it.

631
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,426
And since I am on the most wanted list

632
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:35,328
of every psycho who
wants your family dead,

633
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,299
I guess I'm Team Mikaelson
whether I like it or not.

634
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:56,082
Denne legatura.

635
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:05,558
It's done.

636
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,294
The ring's altered.

637
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:11,264
You keep the benefits, minus the leash.

638
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:17,504
Is this an apology or a thank you?

639
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:21,941
I don't know.

640
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,989
I'm not particularly good at either one.

641
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:45,165
I managed to find an old friend.

642
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:48,134
Or enemy, I can never really tell.

643
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:53,922
Here's to a wretched day.

644
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:59,612
A wretched day indeed.

645
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:07,216
As soon as Hope is better, we'll leave.

646
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,656
She's all that matters.

647
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:21,901
Hey.

648
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,840
I want to ask you something.

649
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:29,844
In the woods,

650
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:33,046
if Vincent hadn't found that loophole...

651
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:36,349
what would you have done to those kids?

652
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:54,133
Whatever I had to do.

653
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:59,672
We have got to stop making it a habit

654
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:02,508
of putting our family
lives ahead of others.

655
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,843
I don't want that for myself,

656
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:05,545
I don't want that for Hope.

657
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:15,889
We have to do better.

658
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:39,256
I know today was rough for you.

659
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:42,025
Hey, at least we put an end to it.

660
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,896
Kinney's dead.

661
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,570
But...

662
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,439
the thing they idolized...

663
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,574
the Hollow...

664
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,576
it must have wanted us there.

665
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,245
It wanted to come into our world

666
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,048
by anchoring itself to one of us.

667
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,918
So that makes me wonder...

668
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,087
did we end it?

669
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,289
Or is it just getting started?

670
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:42,285
You think it's gonna come after me?

671
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,921
Marcel, I'm-a tell you, man.

672
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,624
I wonder if it hasn't
already got to you.

673
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,529
What did you see when
you was in the circle?

674
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,733
Nothing.

675
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:00,437
Not a thing.

676
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,683
I hope you're right.

677
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,793
That's the funny thing about
our city, though, Marcel.

678
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,663
Nothing ever stays buried.

679
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,257
No, no, no.

680
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,293
It's here.

681
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:39,696
The Hollow...

682
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,164
it's here.
