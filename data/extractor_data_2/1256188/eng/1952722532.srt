1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,301
Kids, the day you get married is supposed

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:06,104
To bethe happiest day of your life,

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,907
The perfect ending to a perfect love story.

4
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:11,509
My wedding-- at least my first wedding--

5
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,011
Didn't go so well.

6
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,928
It's funny looking back on it now.

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,931
I was so sure stella was the one.

8
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,034
And when she left me, I was so devastated.

9
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,237
But you guys got me through it.

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,639
And now the painful part's over.

11
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,543
I've come out the other side a little bit stronger.

12
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,246
You know, i... I hardly even think about her anymore.

13
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,849
That's what time does, I guess.

14
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,155
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.

15
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,657
It's been 24 hours.

16
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,859
I know.

17
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,061
And this is me, moving on.

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,262
A great new chapter

19
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,664
Of my life began today,

20
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:03,765
And we're gonna celebrate.

21
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,267
Right now, we need two things.

22
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,470
We need kool, and we need the gang.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,371
It's jukebox time, huh?

24
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,077
I look at that young man

25
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,281
Popping and locking his way over to the jukebox,

26
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:20,683
And I think to myself,

27
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:21,784
You know...

28
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:24,387
Maybe stella made the right call.

29
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:26,389
Ow, pain.

30
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:27,991
How is he dancing right now?

31
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,391
He should... he should be smashing up

32
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:31,494
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.

33
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:33,296
Hypothetical.

34
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,798
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

35
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,400
Ted really is happy.

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,401
He never wanted to get married

37
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,302
In the first place.

38
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,704
Ted just pulled off

39
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:43,806
The greatest train dodge since stand by me.

40
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,310
Well, not the first kid, but the other kids.

41
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,814
No, he is in bad shape.

42
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,215
What's up?

43
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,419
Really bad shape.

44
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,822
And we need to be there for him.

45
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,825
But as much as my friend really want to be there for me,

46
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,726
I was...by all the appearances...

47
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:03,728
Fine.

48
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:04,729
Hey,buddy

49
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,930
Want to hang out?

50
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,533
Guys, I'm fine.

51
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:11,836
Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?

52
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:13,238
I'm fine.

53
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,743
Hey, kiddo.

54
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:20,745
Barney, I'm fine.

55
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:21,947
This is not necessary,

56
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:24,349
And it's actually kind of weird.

57
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:25,851
No offense, ladies.

58
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,354
I did not realize you'd be home.

59
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,057
Ladies, to the stairwell.

60
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,473
Finally, after two weeks,

61
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:48,475
The inevitable emotions boiled over.

62
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,177
Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?

63
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:51,378
Oh, shut up.

64
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,580
I'm sorry, sweetie.

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,782
It's just, ted,

66
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,984
You've been through something traumatic,

67
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,586
And we're trying to be there for you

68
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,387
As friends, but you're not letting us,

69
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,491
And it's pissing us off, you selfish bitch.

70
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,792
Sorry.

71
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:05,894
Look, we're just worried

72
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,895
That you're not dealing with this whole stella thing.

73
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,797
Do you remember when lily left me?

74
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:12,199
You remember how I held in my feelings?

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,305
I... Miss... Her so much.

76
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,608
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

77
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,911
Well, I should have been even worse, okay?

78
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,013
I should have gotten mad.

79
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:25,014
I should have taken your advice

80
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,715
And set all of lily's stuff on fire.

81
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,817
Oh, nice-- thanks, ted.

82
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,419
But I didn't, and I think that that's why

83
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,821
It took me so long to get better.

84
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,022
So, now, ted...

85
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,525
I want you to explode.

86
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,127
Release the berserker.

87
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,928
Okay, ready?

88
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,831
Now!

89
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:43,232
I'm good.

90
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,334
No.

91
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:45,935
Guys, get off his back.

92
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,036
He's happy.

93
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,039
Listen, if ted were married right now,

94
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,640
He'd be married,

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,543
He'd be living in new jersey,

96
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,445
And he'd be married.

97
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,547
He's fine. Now, let's eat.

98
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:58,748
How about flat michael's?

99
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,451
No, that's 44th and lex. Can't do it.

100
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,352
Why not? It's too close to stella's gym.

101
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,355
Might run into her. Anywhere else, though.

102
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,758
Okay, um, how about hurley's?

103
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:09,560
Right between stella's office and her dry cleaners.

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,861
No, sir.

105
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,964
Well, what about meatloaf charlie's?

106
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:15,166
Two blocks from stella's mother's hairdressers.

107
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,968
Well, geez, ted, is there anywhere

108
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,070
In manhattan we can go to dinner?

109
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:20,772
Of course.

110
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,174
Check this out.

111
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,477
What you got there, ted?

112
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,479
A little reference map I made for myself.

113
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,783
A new york guide to places you might run into stella zinman.

114
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:31,584
Red areas

115
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:32,584
Are places to avoid.

116
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:33,986
White areas are safe.

117
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,288
Blue is water.

118
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,890
That is just ridiculous.

119
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,691
Well, water is blue.

120
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:40,393
You can't live that way.

121
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,794
She leaves you at the altar,

122
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,095
And you're the one avoiding her?

123
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,797
Yes, I'm avoiding her.

124
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:45,798
What's the big deal?

125
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:46,699
That's how we do it.

126
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,101
Who's we, gutless weenies?

127
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:52,406
Uh, no, "we" is people from the great state of ohio.

128
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,907
When life gives us pain,

129
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,111
We buckeyes take that pain and we push it down.

130
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,412
And if the pain starts

131
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,213
To come up again,

132
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,515
We push more pain down on top of it.

133
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,918
Why confront something when you can avoid it, right?

134
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:04,818
All I have to do

135
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,120
Is never see stella again,

136
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,922
And I'll live a long, happy life.

137
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:10,124
Now, who wants to get something to eat?

138
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,326
Oh, somebody just told me

139
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,728
About a tapas place that's in the white zone.

140
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,130
Great. Let's go there.

141
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:18,132
You ready to order?

142
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,234
Uh, not quite yet.

143
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,336
Oh, can we get some of those almonds for the table?

144
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,337
Certainly.

145
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,439
Nice call, lily.

146
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,741
This place looks great.

147
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,942
Who told you about it?

148
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,643
You know, I don't remember.

149
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:32,648
What?

150
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,449
i just remembered...

151
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,661
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

152
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,663
Okay, okay, just be cool.

153
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,365
We're just gonna have to deal with this.

154
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,569
Everyone... Follow my lead.

155
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,074
Oh, you're kidding. Is he serious?

156
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,875
I am not getting under thisable.

157
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,779
I'd maybe get under that table.

158
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,781
She's turning around.

159
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,189
Think, think, think.

160
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,590
Everyone, just stay here.

161
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,891
I'm gonna go take a look.

162
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:15,994
Marshall, go take a look.

163
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,102
And will you need utensils?

164
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:25,904
No, I'm just going straight home.

165
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,108
She's placing an order to go.

166
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:32,511
Did she seem happy? Did she say anything about me?

167
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,013
I don't even care.

168
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,314
Where are those almonds?

169
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:36,915
Gosh, where would ted's nuts be?

170
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:39,819
Hey, why don't you check the vise in stella's garage.

171
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,520
Go yell at her.

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,022
Ted, you may be from ohio,

173
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:44,624
But you live in new york now.

174
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,926
We don't push down our feelings in new york.

175
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:48,527
We take our feelings and we shove them

176
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:49,929
In somebody else's face!

177
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,331
Oh, spare me, lily.

178
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,231
You'd be doing the same thing

179
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,433
If you were in this situation.

180
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,634
Thats out of rageous.

181
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,536
There is not a person on earth

182
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,338
I would hide under a table from.

183
00:06:58,338 --> 00:07:00,740
Oh, really, not a single person?

184
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,443
Not even... Gasser?

185
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:06,347
How dare you mention that name to me.

186
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:07,528
Who's gasser?

187
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:08,939
He's the last person

188
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,202
I'd want to see walk through that door.

189
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,753
Michael sasser.

190
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,096
He's a guy I went to high school with.

191
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,849
Michael sat next to me in freshman biology.

192
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,472
He had been a bit of a loser all through middle school,

193
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,463
But the summer before ninth grade,

194
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:25,217
He grew 12 inches and joined the baseball team.

195
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,448
He was right on the precipice

196
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,740
Of becoming one of the cool kids.

197
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:30,372
Until one day...

198
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,186
Oh, lily, we've all been there.

199
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,159
When you've ripped one, it's not pretty.

200
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,471
What did you do?

201
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,752
Are you kidding?

202
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,493
This was ninth grade.

203
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,836
I only had one choice.

204
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,499
Oh, my god, sasser.

205
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,860
Fart much?

206
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,283
No, it wasn't me. It was her.

207
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,495
Oh, as if, sasser.

208
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,397
More like gasser.

209
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:55,618
Gasser!

210
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,871
Gasser! Gasser!

211
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,112
No. Gasser! Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!

212
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,383
I'm on the baseball team.

213
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,685
I-i'm cool.

214
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:03,887
Gasser! Gasser!

215
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,799
The nickname gasser stuck.

216
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:06,750
He got teased so much,

217
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,022
Eventually he had to change schools.

218
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:10,975
Kids are awesome.

219
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,247
I've always felt awful about that.

220
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:15,670
But if gasser-- michael--

221
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,763
Walked in right now, as hard as it would be,

222
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,095
I would go up to gasser-- michael--

223
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,147
And I would resolve things between us.

224
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,290
Right, clear the air, as it were.

225
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,781
Oh, man.

226
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,063
Those don't come around often.

227
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:30,866
Y'all are welcome.

228
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:34,710
Hey, are you guys okay? Oh, yeah.

229
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,491
We're just gonna be eating down here if that's okay.

230
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,204
Well, here's your almonds.

231
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,235
Oh, thanks... You guys have any specials today?

232
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:41,357
Ted, this is ludicrous.

233
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:45,731
Ted, I am a person who... Well, let's just face it.

234
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,844
There are a lot of people I don't want to see--

235
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,387
People of the "chicks I banged" persuasion--

236
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,148
But if any of them were to walk in here,

237
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,389
I would stand up,

238
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,272
And I would look them right in the eye.

239
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,374
Some of them for the very first time.

240
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,887
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?

241
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,240
Not even, say...

242
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,742
Becca delucci?

243
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,343
You son of a bitch.

244
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:08,185
Who's becca delucci?

245
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,447
Do you mind?

246
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,912
So, who is becca delucci?

247
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,024
Becca is just this girl who lives upstate.

248
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,596
I used to visit her now and again.

249
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:21,479
Mm-hmm, where exactly upstate, barney?

250
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,192
Bedford hills federal penitentiary.

251
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:28,926
And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.

252
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,570
No way, really?

253
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,412
Really.

254
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,705
And what I had with becca was a perfect relationship.

255
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:40,229
She was only allowed, by law, to call me once a week.

256
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,771
If she ever got clingy,

257
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,813
The armed guards stopped her.

258
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,744
And I never had to pay for dinner.

259
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,956
Well, that's not true. I pay taxes.

260
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,308
Then again, I guess we all paid for dinner.

261
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:50,469
Thanks a lot, guys.

262
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,682
Anyway, the last time I visited,

263
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,814
I kind of screwed things up.

264
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,786
I know it's hard, baby,

265
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:59,359
But I'm in a prison, too.

266
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,441
A prison of my own heart.

267
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,084
Is that room ready yet or what?

268
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,236
Can we...? Tick-tock.

269
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,368
Barney, you're the only thing

270
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:09,920
That's keeping me going here.

271
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,201
That's what I'm here for, baby.

272
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,563
I'm your rock.

273
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,175
I'm... Oh, my god.

274
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:15,876
Hello, strange.

275
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,853
Barney stinson, attorney at law.

276
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:24,425
Let's talk about getting you off.

277
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,977
Oh, hell, no!

278
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,493
Now I get letters from becca and she's all,

279
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,855
"i'm coming to get you the day I get out of here.

280
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,808
I'm gonna hang your eyes from my rearview mirror."

281
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,501
Women, huh?

282
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,174
See? You're scared of becca.

283
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,645
Lily's scared of gasser.

284
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,197
We're staying under the table.

285
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,523
We don't have to. Stella's gone.

286
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,164
Oh, my gosh.

287
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,278
There, all done,

288
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,351
And that's how we do it ohio style.

289
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,034
Problem showed up. We avoided it. It went away.

290
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,046
Now we can enjoy our meal in peace and...

291
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,117
She's back.

292
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,975
Ted, we all think that you need--

293
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:22,656
Wait, where's barney?

294
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:28,773
Ted,

295
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,336
We all think that you need to go talk to her.

296
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:32,457
I don't. What?

297
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,939
Yeah, if t last person I wanted to see

298
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,860
Walked through the door, I wouldn't say a damn word.

299
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,501
Really?

300
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,654
And who's that? My father.

301
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,267
You guys, that other table is off the hook.

302
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,419
What are we talking about? Robin's dad.

303
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,751
I haven't spoken to him in three years

304
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,373
And I don't intend to start now.

305
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:48,234
Why?

306
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:50,797
It goes back to the day I was born.

307
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,868
You give me my son now. Push.

308
00:11:57,744 --> 00:11:59,155
Oh, no... Oh, no.

309
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,676
He wanted a son

310
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,829
And the fact that I was a girl didn't change his plan.

311
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,740
What do you mean?

312
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:08,705
My full legal name is robin charles scherbatsky, jr.

313
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,668
And it only gets worse from there.

314
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:15,091
When I was eight, he took me hunting for the first time.

315
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,944
I don't want to shoot a deer.

316
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,426
Nonsense, r.J.

317
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,076
Shooting deer

318
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,808
Is the noblest of pursuits.

319
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,790
But they're cute.

320
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,812
You said the same thing about our rabbits.

321
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,815
Remember how delicious they were?

322
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,058
Over the years, as my body developed...

323
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,389
Whoa, hold on a sec.

324
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:34,042
Sorry, go on.

325
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:38,617
It became harder and harder for him to pretend I was a boy.

326
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:41,090
The lowest moment came when I turned 14.

327
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,792
My peewee hockey team had just won the squamish invitational

328
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,104
And everyone came back to my house to celebrate.

329
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:47,916
You lads availed yourself splendidly

330
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,649
Out there on the ice.

331
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:52,701
Splendidly. You go on outside.

332
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,563
I'll come back with an assortment

333
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,196
Of soft drinks and american pretzels.

334
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:00,860
I can't believe

335
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,912
You missed that last empty-netter, you hoser.

336
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,223
You're the hoser.

337
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,645
No, you're the hoser.

338
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,364
What are you doing?

339
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:18,369
You're teammates, hockey players.

340
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,931
Teammates don't kiss!

341
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,065
Hockey players don't kiss!

342
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,588
Oh, my god.

343
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,201
I have no son.

344
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,617
Oh, you poor thing.

345
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,510
To have to grow up in canada

346
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,392
With america right there.

347
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:41,673
That...

348
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,835
Sucks about your dad, robin,

349
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:46,047
But congratulations on that game.

350
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,892
And kyle and I weren't even doing anything serious.

351
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:52,605
We only went to the blue line. The blue line?

352
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,486
Yeah, you know how when you're a kid,

353
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:55,698
You put everything into hockey terms?

354
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,980
The blue line is kissing; the red line is getting naked;

355
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,382
And I think "in the crease" speaks for itself.

356
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:02,675
Anyway, after that,

357
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,998
My relationship with my dad pretty much went north.

358
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:06,329
I moved in with my mom,

359
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,082
Grew my hair out, became a canadian pop star.

360
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,724
You know, normal teen stuff.

361
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,766
Don't you think it would feel better

362
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:14,388
To talk to him about all this?

363
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:15,899
No, that's the point.

364
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:17,511
It wouldn't solve anything.

365
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,233
It's in the past. It's done.

366
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,626
I mean, what would I even say to him?

367
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,637
"i wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?

368
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:26,070
"i wish you hadn't taught me how to hunt

369
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,472
"and fish and smoke cigars and drink scotch

370
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,414
"because that's not what girls do.

371
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,447
"and you know the reason I throw like a girl, dad,

372
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:34,158
Is because I am a girl."

373
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,754
Wow, you held onto that for a long time, huh?

374
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,446
Yeah.

375
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:43,839
It really messed you up.

376
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,201
Yeah.

377
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:47,032
That sucks. I'm sorry.

378
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,293
That's hot.

379
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,607
And then I realized...

380
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,052
All of my friends were haunted,

381
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:59,325
But there was a difference between my ghost and theirs.

382
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,747
It wasn't too late for me.

383
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:04,721
I'm gonna go talk to her.

384
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:11,889
She's gone.

385
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm going after her.

386
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,410
Whoo. Go, go.

387
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,054
There she goes!

388
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:25,963
Okay, I see her.

389
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,315
She's two cabs ahead on the right.

390
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:28,356
Just stay with her, okay?

391
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,488
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.

392
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,809
You're going to confront her.

393
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,641
Yes, I am going to confront her. Yeah.

394
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,842
This is so exciting.

395
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,444
Totally. What are you going to say?

396
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:41,039
I'm gonna say, "stella, I'm sorry things didn't work out."

397
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,911
Ay, caramba. No! Yes.

398
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,913
We're going to talk about this like adults.

399
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,306
She can tell me her side and... I'm going to listen.

400
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:49,417
Probably

401
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,739
Should have done a little more of that before.

402
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,181
Driver, can you run us into the nearest lamppost?

403
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,373
Everyone, buckle up. Not you, ted.

404
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:55,534
Ted, ted,

405
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,356
You got to get mad right now.

406
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,358
Come on. Dig deep.

407
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,410
Dude, come on. This isn't about me waving my arms,

408
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,313
Stamping my feet, and getting really mad.

409
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,693
This is about stella and i

410
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,165
Finally communicating.

411
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,056
I mean, clearly, that was...

412
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,470
Stella hated star wars. She lied to you.

413
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,493
Search your feelings, ted. You know it to be true.

414
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,865
Well, that's her business.

415
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,839
Come on, ted. She left you at the altar.

416
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't understand!

417
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,172
Ted, in the name of all that is sacred...

418
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,263
Wait, wait, wait!

419
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:24,304
Where is she going?

420
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:26,266
Her cab just missed the turn for the lincoln tunnel.

421
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,208
Why would anybody

422
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:28,038
Buy takeout food

423
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:30,361
And bring it all the way back to new jersey anyway?

424
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,843
Maybe she's going to her office.

425
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:32,864
No.

426
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:35,766
The waiter asked her, "will you need utensils?"

427
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,949
And then she said, "nah, I'm just going straight home."

428
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,382
But if she's going home, why are we still heading...?

429
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,484
Oh, my god.

430
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:44,886
Tony lives downtown.

431
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,870
"home" is tony's apartment.

432
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,342
She was going to make me move to new jersey

433
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:54,767
And then she moves into the city with tony?!

434
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,949
Son of a bitch!

435
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:58,000
Finally.

436
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,121
Finally, buddy.

437
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,583
I am so angry right now!

438
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,254
I know, and I love it!

439
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,828
Yeah, that is awesome!

440
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,350
Sir, we'd be happy to cover

441
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,412
The cost of that window crank.

442
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,094
I love angry ted!

443
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,425
So do i!

444
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,429
Get it out, baby. Let it out.

445
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,851
Oh... She's stopping.

446
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:18,892
Oh, it is on.

447
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,403
It is on! Yes, ted.

448
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,745
Go get her, buddy!

449
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,137
Go get rid of your demons!

450
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,418
My leg is asleep!

451
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,409
Okay, wa-wa-wait.

452
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,370
Wait, hold on. Lily,

453
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,091
What are you doing?

454
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:28,882
All right, hold on.

455
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:30,734
Look, ted,

456
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,317
It's great that you're angry right now. It sure is.

457
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:34,618
Yes. Yeah!

458
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,220
And that you're finally dealing

459
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,113
With this, but you only get one shot here.

460
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:40,605
Let's just take a beat and,

461
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:42,877
And think about what you're going to say.

462
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,961
Oh, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

463
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,084
You picked the wrong guy.

464
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:00,786
Ted.

465
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,429
You picked the wrong guy.

466
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,856
You made a really, really, really bad choice.

467
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:13,219
What were you thinking?

468
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:14,320
That guy?

469
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,123
Are you kidding me?

470
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:19,035
Have you learned nothing in the last eight years?

471
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:21,528
You're just gonna regret this.

472
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:22,459
You know that, right?

473
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,131
You are going to regret this,

474
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,852
And now there is nothing you can do about it

475
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,374
Because it's too late.

476
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:29,927
All you can do now is go up there

477
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:33,330
And start your crappy, disappointing life

478
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,703
That will never be nearly as happy

479
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,405
As the one you could have had with me.

480
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:40,828
Good-bye.

481
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,140
Ted, wait.

482
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,293
Look, stella, I am not here to win you back.

483
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:46,083
I am here

484
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:49,408
Because I need to know that you know

485
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:51,880
You made the biggest mistake of your life.

486
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,243
I know.

487
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:58,747
Good.

488
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,182
That's what I'm gonna say. Oh...

489
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,815
Cold-blooded. Yeah, that's good.

490
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,137
Go say that.

491
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,861
Thanks.

492
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,445
So I got out of the cab, ready to say all of that stuff,

493
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,008
Ready to explode, but then...

494
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,859
Mommy! H-h-hey. Hey.

495
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:25,865
It all just went away.

496
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,032
And that was it.

497
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,174
In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.

498
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,618
I could see stella was meant to be with tony.

499
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,521
Kids, you may think your only choices

500
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,053
Are to swallow your anger

501
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,674
Or throw it in someone's face.

502
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,597
there is a third option

503
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:47,078
You can just let it go,

504
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,781
And only when you do that is it really gone,

505
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,132
And you can move forward.

506
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,837
And that, kids, was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.

507
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,569
It just wasn't mine.

508
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,293
Mine was still out there waiting for me.
