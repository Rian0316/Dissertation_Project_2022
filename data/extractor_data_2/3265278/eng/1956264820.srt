00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,113
Oh, I closed out
the cupcake register.

1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,076
Here's our rent money.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,033
Give me back the envelope, though,
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,550
No, I closed out the register.
I have our rent money.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,954
Max, do you know what this means?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,310
Unless I was hit in the head
by a piece of farm equipment,

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,317
it means we have extra money.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,953
I wanna do the extra money dance,

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,958
but we don't have one because
we've never had extra money!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,433
The only extra money dance I know

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,200
involves ping-pong balls
and I'm really out of practice.

(CASH REGISTER RINGS)

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,798
Earl, I brought you your favorite.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
A half-black, half-Chinese
belly dancer?

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,674
A coconut cupcake.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,233
Look at Caroline over there.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,035
She's flirting harder with him
than I flirt with heart disease.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,631
Stop, stop! I'm only on episode two
of Season One. I will kill you!

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,517
Then... to be continued.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,109
Oh, it's gonna be continued.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,677
Well, then, we will continue this
when we continue this.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,477
(GIGGLES)

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,751
If that's your game, you're gonna
be living with me forever, Fran.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,679
He's been in my section three nights
in a row for the Turkey Club.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,518
I'm calling him
"The Turkey Club Cutie."

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,676
I'm calling Poison Control.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,272
I think he's getting ready
to ask me out.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,630
He wanted to know if I live
around here and what time I get off.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,196
If a man's gonna wait
for you to get off, he's a keeper.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,114
So... see you next time.

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,269
- I will see you next time as well.
- Bye.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,071
- What's that?
- I don't know. How would I know?

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,316
Because it came out of your head?

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,272
I don't have hair extensions, Max.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,197
- (SCOFFS) Okay, I'll throw it out.
- No! I'll keep it for the story.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,235
What story?

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,113
The story about how we found
a blonde hair extension

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,992
out of nowhere that night.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,990
(CACKLES)

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,156
It's hilarious!

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,193
Well, it's already funnier
than most of your stories.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,955
Oh, look,
there's another hilarious story.

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,156
Okay, Max,
I have a confession to make.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,076
I have hair extensions.

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,273
I also have a confession to make.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,630
I murdered a man in Rhode Island.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,431
I just have a few.
It gives me volume.

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,358
Too bad it doesn't give you depth.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,230
Now I have to go
and try and reattach these.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,716
These weaves are supposed to last.
This is unbe-weave-able!

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,479
I found this in the lettuce.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,433
Any sign of a NuvaRing in there?
'Cause I can't find mine.

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,758
Caroline's losing her hair,
isn't she? Is she sick?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,791
Does she have cancer, the Big "C"?

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,558
No, Little You.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,550
She doesn't have the Big "C".
She barely has the double As.

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,273
- Han found more of your hair.
- He knows about the extensions?

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,710
No, he thinks you have cancer.

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,478
Oh, good!
So no one knows.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,431
<i>Hola</i>, ladies!
Your night just got sexier.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,079
Luis, you punched out hours ago.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,953
What are you doing here so late?
On your way homo?

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,235
(LAUGHS)

64
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,999
Good one, hooker!

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,229
No, I'm between clubs.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,078
"Circus" just became a straight club,

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,748
and "Satellite" doesn't become
a gay club for a half hour.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,558
So, I'm here to have a cocktail
with my bro Oleg.

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,076
Luis, we told you.
Oleg is straight.

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,430
Oh, please!
So am I in Alabama.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,149
Well, he left already.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,717
But I told him I was gonna stop by.
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,438
Oh, Carolina, while I'm here,
this is yours.

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,595
I found it during my shift.

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,552
Ooh, tips from my tables?

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,034
More like hair from your head.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,838
I knew this was
all too good to be true.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,393
You have extensions.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,599
No, I have cancer.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,032
No, you have extensions.
Good try.

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,559
Later!

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,630
Hey. Notice anything different?

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,513
I took some of the extra money
and got new hair extensions.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,474
And I also got you a surprise.
I put it in your room. Go look!

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,716
I'm not interested
unless it's a potbelly pig

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,512
or a potbelly pig
in a pilgrim costume

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,995
or a pilgrim in a potbelly pig
costume orjust pot.

88
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,352
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.
What do you think? Do you love?

89
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,553
Okay, why is all this crap on my bed?
And what the hell is it?

90
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,829
That's a bed skirt.

91
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,759
My bed doesn't wear skirts.
It's a dude!

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,917
I know because it pokes me
in the back while I'm asleep.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,237
I got you new bedding
and me some cute new flannel jammies.

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,793
They have Eiffel Towers on them.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,877
They were marked down because
everybody hates French people.

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,199
These don't even have stains!

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,789
How am I gonna know
which is the top now?

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,835
Max, what's the problem?

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,713
You've had those old sheets forever.
You don't even have a spare set.

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,799
A spare set of sheets?
Who am I, the Queen of England?

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,597
You're so frustrating,
I'd pull my hair out,

102
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,756
but I'm not sure
which of it is mine.

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,077
- Look! Look! Are you happy?
- (HORSE NICKERS)

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,111
Chestnut's upset.
He knows we're fighting.

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Good, he should know that
if he goes out for a bag of chips,

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,591
he could come home to find you
replaced his saddle with a thong.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,358
I got you a present. Would you
be this angry at Santa Claus?

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,959
Who's that?

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,631
Max, please. Just for a change,
try sleeping on something nice.

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,070
Fine!

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,713
But if I wanted
to sleep on something nice,

112
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,069
I would have hooked up with that guy

113
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,918
who moved home
to take care of his sick mother.

114
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,357
Watch your back, Chestnut.
Watch your back.

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,392
(CLICK)

116
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,710
Where are my old sheets, bitch?

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,549
(WHINING) Why? Why are
you calling me a "bitch" at night?

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,399
I was sleeping in my new jammies.

119
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Well, I can't sleep without
those sheets, so where are they?

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,679
I checked all your drawers.

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,351
And by the way, who hides
their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,555
You already know the answer,
so I'm going back to sleep.

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,396
(WHINING) Why?

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,273
Why am I on the floor
in my new jammies?

125
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,989
Where are they?

126
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,430
I don't have them.
I gave them to the poor.

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,599
You took them from the poor!
And the poor wants them back.

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,951
Well, it's too late. I put them in
the Salvation Army donation bin.

129
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,436
Well, get up.
You're going to the army, bitch.

130
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,073
(WHINING) Why? Why are we here
in the middle of the night?

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,593
What are we doing?

132
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,352
There it is. Come on.
Follow me.

133
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,959
Max, is this where you kill me?

134
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,993
'Cause I always knew it was gonna
happen, I just didn't know when.

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,272
This feels right, though.

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,075
I should kill you. Those sheets
were really special to me, okay?

137
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,113
Oh, did you lose
your virginities on them?

138
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,353
I don't have sex in beds.
That's where I eat.

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,629
Caroline, I have a confession.

140
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,673
- What is it?
- You have hair extensions.

141
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,871
Okay, I'll tell you, but look away.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,434
It's the pillowcase.
I've had it since I was a kid.

143
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,595
It's like soft and nubby and
it had this edge that I'd like rub

144
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,758
and it relaxed me when things
were crappy, which was all the time.

145
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,193
I guess I still need
that pillowcase to sleep or whatever.

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,038
Max, that's so sad.

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,630
Of course it's sad!
When has it ever been a happy tale?

148
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,711
All right, I need to crawl in here.

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,275
Max, you're just gonna crawl
into that dirty box?

150
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,675
We don't know where that bin's been.

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,078
By the way, "Dirty Box" was
my nickname in continuation school.

152
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,635
I need help. Would you rather I step
on your back or your head?

153
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,310
My head? Hardly.
Not at these prices.

154
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,435
Come on.
Gimme ten fingers.

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,790
I already did. Behind your back
while we were walking here.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,912
No, like this, so I can step into it.
You know, like a finger basket.

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,078
Finger basket?
Is that another nickname of yours?

158
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,715
No, but for one summer,
it could've been.

159
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,792
Forget this.
Just help me pull this stuff over.

160
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,434
- Ew. Ew
- Ew. Ew.

161
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,511
Max, I feel like we're not even
acknowledging our low points anymore.

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,871
Okay, Max, now be very careful.
And on the count of...

163
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,791
Wow, you could've been
a great gymnast,

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,310
if you'd had money, coaches
and a breast reduction.

165
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,595
Are you okay?

166
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,310
CAROLINE: Max?

167
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,476
Gonna need some voice contact.

168
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,989
MAX <i>:</i> I'm not in here alone.

169
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,873
What do you mean you're not alone?

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,478
MAX: I mean I'm not in here alone.

171
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,275
CAROLINE: Stay calm! I will
get you out of there! No, I won't!

172
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,277
MAX: I'm looking for a lever
on the inside.

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,150
(LEVER CLICKS)

174
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,353
(SHOUTS) Get outta my house!

175
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,388
Okay, I just wanna check
and see if you're on my pillowcase.

176
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,875
- Max, no!
- I need my sweet sheets!

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,277
Let it go. And if your sheets are
under there, they're no long sweet.

178
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
(SHOUTING) Get outta my house!
And close the door!

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,390
Okay! Okay! God!

180
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,034
Jeez!
You'd think we'd slept together!

181
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,475
What am I gonna do?
I can't sleep without those sheets!

182
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,715
MAX: I'm so angry at you!

183
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
I'd be even angrier
if I hadn't found this great bra.

184
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,230
Why are you going to Sophie's
if you're trying to sleep?

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,351
She's the loudest person we know.

186
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,518
Even black people at the movies
tell Sophie to be quiet.

187
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,516
I am going to Sophie's
to get a sleeping pill.

188
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,075
Or as she likes to call them,
"night candy."

189
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,474
You don't need a pill.

190
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,148
Listen, I've a great sleep technique
that my sleep coach taught me.

191
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,191
I have slept
with my fair share of coaches

192
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,436
and if anything, they kept me awake.

193
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,712
Max, it's 3:00am. Any normal person
is sleeping right now.

194
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,673
(POLISH ACCENT) Hi, girls.

195
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,429
Just doing a puzzle
and listening to Elvis.

196
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,950
You two want a Mai Tai
before you get too Ti-Ti?

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,718
No, thanks, but speaking of Ti-Ti,

198
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,990
I was hoping I could snag
one of your sleeping pills.

199
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,397
Oh, sure, I can hook you up.
I never use them.

200
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,672
I only need three hours of sleep
at night and six during the day.

201
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,915
Come on.

202
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,436
Sophie, notice anything new?

203
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,156
Oh, yeah! You planted more hair
on your head. I heard.

204
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,879
Max! You told her?

205
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,718
No, it was on CNN.

206
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,674
They led with Syria and then
did a solid five on your hair.

207
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,956
Here we go! Pills and spices!

208
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,631
You have a spice rack full of pills?
You gotta cook me dinner sometime.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,791
Let's see.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,915
Fish oil, penicillin, amoxicillin.
Skittles.

211
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,113
Oh, and this is my German pill,

212
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,949
in case they release the bombs,
or I'm ever abandoned in space.

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
Here you go, Max.
Nighty-night.

214
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,030
Oh, you know what? What the hell!

215
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,312
I'm gonna have one too.
It's a slumber party!

216
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,430
Uh-oh.

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,918
Oh, now you got
another rack full of pills.

218
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,796
Oh, you know what?

219
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,669
Don't wait for me, Max.
This might be a while.

220
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,153
Max, do you really need to take that?

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,430
People do weird things
on sleeping pills.

222
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,915
My friend Candice Travelstead
buttered a wallet

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,519
and tried to eat it.

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,078
Don't worry.
I don't have a wallet.

225
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,599
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,313
Is that the sleeping pill

227
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,239
or is that my emergency space pill
that kills you?

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,992
Either way, I'll get some shut-eye.

229
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,589
Max, no! You are not gonna die
and leave me here alone.

230
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,712
I still don't know how to go east
on the "L" train without a chaperone.

231
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,919
Max, it's 3:30am

232
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,477
and sleep coach Caroline here will
have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

233
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,113
You're supposed
to be taking a hot bath.

234
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,437
I was, but when I put the stopper in,
something pushed it back out again.

235
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,629
Now where's that pill?

236
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,230
I've got it on my person and if this
doesn't work I'll give it to you.

237
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,113
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill
and don't think I won't.

238
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,835
Max, meet your new sheets.
New sheets, meet...

239
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,713
Don't make me meet the sheets.
I'm not a mental patient.

240
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,354
If I was,
I'd be living in a much nicer place.

241
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,312
And all my pillowcases
would have edges.

242
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,795
Wow, even your pillowcase
had an edge.

243
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,148
What was it like anyway?

244
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,271
It was kinda like
the end of your new PJs

245
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,790
but not the queerest thing
I've ever seen.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,833
A candle?
What are we, witches?

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,118
Now, imagine yourself
in a relaxed, beautiful place.

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,517
Breathe in and out.

249
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,472
In and out.

250
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,433
Look, if there's one thing
old "Finger Basket" knows how to do,

251
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,959
it's in and out.

252
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,469
- Gimme the pill.
- I'm not finished yet.

253
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,590
But just so you know,

254
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,030
that pill has changed colors
three times in the last hour.

255
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,312
So it's either deadly,
or an Everlasting Gobstopper.

256
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,988
I am so mad at you.
You took my one thing.

257
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,156
That pillowcase
was my one special thing.

258
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,078
In my whole life of people
taking things away from me,

259
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,793
that was the one thing no one took.

260
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,468
And now I'm never gonna sleep again.
And I love sleeping.

261
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,558
Dreaming is the closest thing
I have to cable TV.

262
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,150
Enough, Max!

263
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,079
I've been very patient
with this weird attachment you have

264
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,077
to this little piece of sheet.

265
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,316
You're a piece of sheet!

266
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,353
Listen, if I learned anything
when I lost everything,

267
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,039
it's that, A, there's no wiggle room

268
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,151
when it comes
to cottage cheese expiration dates,

269
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,193
and, B, you can't get attached
to material things.

270
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,789
(SCOFFS)
Oh! Okay, Extensions!

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,149
What does that mean?

272
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,955
It means that your material things
are literally attached to your head.

273
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,195
Not the same thing at all.

274
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,119
Your dependency on that pillowcase is
all in your head. You don't need it.

275
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,912
Oh. You don't need this.

276
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,951
You owe me $14.

277
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,519
Run a tab.

278
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,517
I'm not about to sit here
and take this abuse

279
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,359
because you have an unhealthy
attachment to a pillowcase!

280
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,629
Good night, Malibu Barbie.

281
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,991
I hope you're not trying to insult me
because she's gorgeous!

282
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,351
And for the record, I do not have
an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

283
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,198
Oh, really?

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,599
You're a monster!

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,438
I'm sorry. I can't sleep.

286
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,232
I'll be fine.
Just give me the pill.

Brace yourself, Earl.

When Max gets here,
she will not be in a good mood.

294

Caroline, if I wanted
to work around people in a good mood,

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,833
I'd go work at Google.

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,514
She hasn't slept since yesterday
and is furious

297
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,994
because I won't give her
a sleeping pill.

298
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,516
Smart move.
Sleeping pills mess you up.

299
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,709
I took one once,

300
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,959
woke up a day later on the
roller coaster ride in Coney Island.

301
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,869
- I love roller coasters.
- Me too, when I'm in a seat.

302
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,395
Oh, hello!
How are you two tonight?

303
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,269
Oh, no. She's nice.
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

304
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,916
No. No pills. Just had some clarity.
Follow me, please.

305
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,157
Oh, okay.
Did you smoke or snort this clarity?

306
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,028
Now, since you were nice enough
to get me new sheets,

307
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,435
I got you something in return.
Here.

308
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,871
Oh, is this like an apology,
thank you kind of thing?

309
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,914
Now watch. This is how
one graciously accepts a gift.

310
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,156
What the hell is this?

311
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,709
Awig?

312
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,913
Either that or you scalped a lesbian
from the '80s.

313
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,159
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie and
climbed up on her shoulder pads.

314
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,794
You took away my security thing,
the pillowcase.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,673
So now I'm taking away
your security thing, your hair.

316
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,108
You can wear
that on your head tonight

317
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,878
and then tell me again
how this is all in my head.

318
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,911
Did you have to get
the ugliest one they had?

319

What do you want for 37 cents?

320
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,392
Fine,
I'll put this roadkill on my head

321
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,955
just to prove to you
that I am so much more than my hair.

my brain, my bravery...

332
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,432
And I love that you have an outfit
for everything I ask you to do.

333
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,677
Hey, where's the blonde narc fan?

334
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,833
(SOPHIE LAUGHS)

335
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,236
Oh, my God!

336
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,432
Did Caroline join a bowling team?

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,910
Max! No!

338
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,997
Aw, crap!
Rod Stewart just busted us!

339
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,192
Let her have some fun.
What's the big deal, square?

340
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,868
The big deal is that Max
thinks she needs these pills

341
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,672
because I threw away her blankie.

342
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,155
It was a pillowcase
and I need it to sleep.

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,713
She has to rub it.

344
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,639
In Poland, I had this little thing

345
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,957
that I liked to tickle
before I went to sleep.

346
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,549
But my aunt threw it away.

347
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,829
What was it?

348
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,670
My cousin, Nora.

349
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,235
Give me the pills.

350
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,273
Nope. And, Max, you were wrong.
See? I'm not attached to my hair.

351
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,596
In fact, I am loving my new look.

352
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,234
Am I a single mom
trying to keep it simple?

353
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,874
Am I an Assistant DA in over my head?

354
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,312
Or am I Charlize Theron
in <i>The Jon Bon Jovi Story</i>?

355
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,632
Maybe, and I'm fine with it
'cause I am not my hair.

356
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,071
Oh, my God!
Turkey Club Cutie! Hide me!

357
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,598
On your knees in a bad wig.

358
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,995
Listen, girl, I've been there.

359
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,633
No, I just don't wanna be seen...

360
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,990
Caroline, Caroline, I love you,
but I can't hear anymore.

361
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,475
That hair was hard enough to look at
in the '70s.

362
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,118
Fine! You were right, I was wrong.

363
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,276
Now help me get this off.
He can't see me like this.

364
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,959
That's right.
Gimme the pills.

365
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,515
Max, no. You don't need them.
We don't know where they've been.

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,550
Fine!
I'm going home to try to sleep.

367
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,035
Since this is all your fault,
you can finish my shift.

368
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,629
You're on your own, lady who lived
across the street from Al Bundy.

369
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,315
I gotta say,
I'm pretty impressed I can do this.

370
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,956
It's not so hard. I don't know what
Chanice is always bitching about.

371
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,151
I guess that's who she is.

372
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,590
I can't believe
I still haven't slept.

373
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,279
I'm gonna be awake forever.

374
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,790
It's gonna be like that movie
<i>Awakenings</i>, but not at all.

375
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,549
Max, you can rub me.

376
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,632
Wow, that wig changed you.

377
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,829
No, here.

378
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,190
Rub the edge on the bottom of my
jammie top like it's your pillowcase.

379
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,110
No. If I rub the bottom of your
jammies, that would be my bottom.

380
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,077
Turkey Club Cutie didn't ask me out.

381
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,316
Probably 'cause my hair
was so messed up from the wig.

382
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,953
Don't be so hard on yourself.

383
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,196
It could've been
your personality too.

384
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,351
You really think
he only liked you for your hair?

385
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,516
I only like me for my hair.

386
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,114
- Told you. You're attached to it.
- So attached to it!

387
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,834
Twirling it, tossing it, flipping it.

388
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,793
Feeling it on my neck,
on my shoulders, on my back.

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,877
Caroline Channing
without the option of a sleek updo

390
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,514
is not Caroline Channing.

391
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,039
And I'm sorry.

392
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,276
I'm sorry I judged you
for having an attachment to something

393
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,232
when I'm no better.

394
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,079
And I'm sorry
I got rid of your sweet sheets.

395
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,349
Max.

396
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,357
Max?

397
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,909
Night, Max.

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,359
(WHINING) Why?

399
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,677
Why can't I ever have anything nice?

400
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,109
