00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:03,020
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:06,119
My brother-- he's got
a big crush on Bernadette.

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,593
You're moving
back to India?

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,184
What's going on?

5
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,635
(laughs)

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:22,522
It's-It's not
what it looks like.

7
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:28,161
What does it look like?

8
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,866
It's not what it looks like.

9
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:38,705
It's not what it looks like.

10
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,373
What are you grinding about?

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,593
Penny's brain teaser
this morning.

12
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,211
She and Koothrappali

13
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,430
emerge from your bedroom.

14
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:50,967
She is disheveled, and Raj
is dressed only in a sheet.

15
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,189
The sole clue:
"It's not what it looks like."

16
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,891
Just let it go, Sheldon.

17
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:02,695
If I could, I would,
but I can't, so I shan't.

18
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,897
Now, knowing Penny,

19
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:08,067
the obvious answer is,
they engaged in coitus.

20
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,619
But...

21
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,354
since that's
what it looked like,

22
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:14,607
we can rule that out.

23
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:15,708
Let's put on

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,711
our thinking cap, shall we?

25
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,135
Raj is from India,
a tropical country.

26
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:27,837
Third World hygiene.

27
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,207
Parasitic infections are common,
such as pinworms.

28
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,809
Mm-hmm.
The procedure

29
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,560
for diagnosing pinworms
is to wait

30
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,429
until the subject is asleep,

31
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,032
and the worms crawl out
of the rectum for air.

32
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,357
Yes, just like that.

33
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,326
Penny could have been

34
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,829
inspecting Raj's anal region
for parasites.

35
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,364
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,416
That's a true blue friend.

37
00:01:56,418 --> 00:02:00,420
They slept together, Sherlock.

38
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,455
No, you weren't listening.

39
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,875
She said
it's <i>not</i> what it looks like.

40
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,294
She lied.

41
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,383
Oh.

42
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,937
Don't I look silly

53
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,088
Hey.

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,922
Hey.

55
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,924
Hey.

56
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,858
Hey.

57
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,454
Leonard, is it awkward for you

58
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,290
knowing that one of your dear
friends had sexual intercourse

59
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,158
with a woman you used to love

60
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,794
in the very place
you lay your head?

61
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,982
No, I'm fine with it.

62
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,134
That sounds like sarcasm,

63
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,169
but I'm going to disregard it,

64
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,889
because I have an agenda--
paintball.

65
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,340
Specifically,
the interdepartmental

66
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,775
tournament this weekend.

67
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,844
In order to function better
as a fighting unit,

68
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,680
I thought we should establish
a chain of command.

69
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,149
Now, it goes
without saying

70
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,101
that I would outrank
the three of you,

71
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:43,071
but the question remains,
by how much?

72
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,322
Now,

73
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,958
I don't see me
as some four-star general,

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,876
back at HQ riding a desk

75
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,995
and playing golf
with the Secretary of Defense.

76
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,047
But I also can't be
Sergeant Cooper,

77
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,465
because that might lead you

78
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,834
to think of me
as just a regular Joe.

79
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,370
This might take some thought.
As you were.

80
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,139
What the hell is wrong with you?

81
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,807
Yeah, how could
you do that?

82
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,343
- What is it to you?
- I got his back.

83
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,211
Yeah, right. You're just jealous
because it turns out

84
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,712
I'm Penny's
number two choice after Leonard.

85
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:12,567
Hey, if I wasn't engaged
to Bernadette,

86
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,185
that totally could have been me.

87
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,188
Please. Sheldon would have been
before you,

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,241
and he might not even
have genitals!

89
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,609
Why do you care so much?

90
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,894
You're dating my sister,

91
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,662
and Penny and I are in love.

92
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,997
BOTH:
What?!

93
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,250
Gentlemen,
if I may interject,

94
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,569
I've decided my rank
will be captain.

95
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,422
If it's good enough for
Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo,

96
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,591
it's good enough for me.

97
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,826
You're not in love with Penny.

98
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,211
Yes, I am.

99
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,132
The god Kamadeva has shot us
with his flowery arrows of love.

100
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,266
Who?

101
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,651
He's the Hindu version of Cupid,

102
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,104
but way better,
because he rides a giant parrot.

103
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:54,192
Raj, come on. You fall in love
with any girl who smiles at you.

104
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,445
A month ago, you were writing
poems about his fiancée.

105
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,531
I'm sorry. What?!

106
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,568
Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

107
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,770
"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

108
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:11,459
That could have been
about anyone.

109
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,777
Besides, you have nothing
to worry about,

110
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:17,615
because now I'm the dusky half
of Koothrapenny.

111
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,718
For the record,
I do have genitals.

112
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:24,872
They're functional
and aesthetically pleasing.

113
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,049
(groans)

114
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,135
Well.

115
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,354
(knocking)

116
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,723
Oh. Coming.

117
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,225
Yup, that's good.

118
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,577
Wine glasses
<i>should</i> have handles.

119
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,365
Keeping accurate track
of your alcohol intake.

120
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,618
Smart idea considering
how trampy you get

121
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,319
when you've had a few.

122
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,104
You heard what I did?

123
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,840
Well, I heard <i>who</i> you did.

124
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,091
(grunts)

125
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,793
Oh, my God,

126
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,495
I screwed up everything.

127
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,097
I hurt Leonard.

128
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,298
I hurt Raj.

129
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
I mean, what is wrong with me?

130
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,168
I feel like
two totally different people--

131
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,388
Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

132
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,724
Don't be so hard on yourself.

133
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,560
Do you know the story
of Catherine the Great?

134
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:20,528
No.

135
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,845
She ruled Russia

136
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,531
in the late 1700s,
and one night,

137
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,349
when she was feeling
particularly randy,

138
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,201
she used an intricate
system of pulleys

139
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:30,171
to have intimate
relations with a horse.

140
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,740
I'm... I'm sorry.

141
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,458
What does this have
to do with me?

142
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,495
She engaged in
interspecies hanky-panky,

143
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,047
and people still
call her "Great."

144
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,532
I'm sure your
reputation can survive

145
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,051
you shagging a
little Indian boy.

146
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,891
(knocking)

147
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,425
(sighs)

148
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:55,179
You jerk face!

149
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,665
What did you tell Howard?!

150
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,934
Did you say there was something
going on between us?

151
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,135
Because he thinks there is!

152
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,604
He's completely freaking out!

153
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:06,357
Please, come in.

154
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,726
- What the hell is wrong with you?!
- Well...

155
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,829
You were always so nice to me,
I thought maybe you liked me.

156
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm nice to everyone!

157
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,501
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,453
Damn right, you're sorry!

159
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:23,040
And you tell Howard there's
never been anything between us!

160
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,010
- I will. Hey, Bernadette?
- What?!

161
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,095
Do you think
I have a shot with Penny?

162
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,247
Of course you do.
You're a cutie pie!

163
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,250
Any girl would be lucky
to have you!

164
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,589
You know, I've
done this before.

165
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,107
In kindergarten,

166
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,059
I was supposed to marry
Jason Sorensen at recess,

167
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,861
but by the time
my class got out there,

168
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,147
he was already engaged
to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

169
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:48,432
So what did I do?

170
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,067
Hung upside down
from the monkey bars,

171
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,537
let all the boys see
my underpants.

172
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,822
You can't blame yourself.

173
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,441
When your prefrontal cortex
fails to make you happy,

174
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,110
promiscuity rewards you with
the needed flood of dopamine.

175
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,615
We neurobiologists refer
to this as the "skank reflex."

176
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,050
You know what?

177
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,635
Let's get out of here.

178
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:08,919
Where are we going?

179
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,788
Somewhere where no
one's seen me naked.

180
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,640
We may have to
drive awhile.

181
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,508
(clears throat)

182
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,768
Subtlety isn't
her strong suit, is it?

183
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,103
Can I stay at your
place for a few nights?

184
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,238
Really?

185
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,427
A best friend sleepover? Yay.

186
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,828
Yeah, sure. Yay!

187
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,696
We'll make popcorn,
stay up all night

188
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:38,666
and I'll teach you
my secret language, Op.

189
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,751
- Sounds great.
- Nope.

190
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,754
Sounds "Gop Rop E A Top."

191
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,624
- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.
- No, you're not.

192
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:51,262
You're gonna
"Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."

193
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,303
Do we really have
to wear this camouflage crap

194
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,355
to play paintball?

195
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:02,640
Who said that?

196
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,859
Leonard, I can
hear your voice,

197
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,811
but I can't see you.

198
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,364
I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

199
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,233
Oh, there you are!

200
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,184
Leonard,

201
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,538
I know you're upset
about recent events, and

202
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,040
I have someone
here to help.

203
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,708
I don't want
to talk to Amy.

204
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,694
No, it's not Amy.

205
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,663
Hello, dear.

206
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,665
You called my mother?

207
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,883
Oh, Leonard,

208
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,836
is it really necessary
to caption the obvious?

209
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,156
He's been like that
since he was a toddler.

210
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,141
"Look, Mommy-- a butterfly."

211
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,527
Maddening.

212
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,646
What's going on?
What do you want?

213
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,931
Sheldon informed me

214
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,150
that you're experiencing
an emotional upheaval,

215
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,585
and I'm here to help.

216
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,087
That's so nice.

217
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,540
And we're back to the obvious.

218
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,276
Now, what's up?

219
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,779
Well, uh... okay.

220
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:00,831
Um...

221
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,084
I don't want to get
back together with Penny.

222
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:06,370
We tried it, it was crazy,
it didn't work,

223
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,872
but I can't deal with the fact

224
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,957
that she slept
with my friend Raj.

225
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,242
And then I find out
that Raj's sister Priya,

226
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,712
who I've been going out with
for eight months,

227
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,180
is moving back to India.

228
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,583
So I'm just completely confused
and alone.

229
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,102
I understand.

230
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,753
Got any advice?

231
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,939
Yes. Buck up.

232
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,058
Excuse me.

233
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,643
You're a world-renowned expert

234
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,395
in parenting
and child development,

235
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,430
and all you've got is "Buck up"?

236
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,232
Sorry.

237
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,951
Buck up, sissy pants.

238
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,404
Thanks, Mother.
I feel much better.

239
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,373
If you need any more help
from me,

240
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,792
my books are available
on Amazon.

241
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,994
Logging off.

242
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:56,390
...ninety-nine,
one hundred.

243
00:10:56,391 --> 00:11:00,610
It's like a waterfall
of liquid gold.

244
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,045
My turn.

245
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:09,269
(sighs) You know,
I don't even know what the point

246
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,704
of me staying in L.A. is.

247
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,457
I haven't gotten a single acting
job since I moved out here.

248
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,408
The closest I came
was last month,

249
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,944
I got a callback
for a hemorrhoid commercial.

250
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:22,199
Oh, I could so see you being
the face of hemorrhoids.

251
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,918
I know, right?

252
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,952
(sighs)

253
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,121
Maybe I should just
move back to Nebraska.

254
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,223
No, I can't let
you do that.

255
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,291
Why not?

256
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:32,292
(knock on door)

257
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,743
For the first
time ever,

258
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,178
I have a thriving
social life.

259
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,146
And no pressure,

260
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:39,399
but it kind of
lives and dies with you.

261
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,302
Hi, Amy.

262
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,520
Can I talk to Penny?

263
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,939
A guest in my trundle bed
and a boy at my door?

264
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:50,443
I wish I could tell 13-year-old
me "it does get better."

265
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,362
How did you know I was here?

266
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,647
It's all over her
Facebook page.

267
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,036
I'll take your stuff
to the bedroom

268
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:01,671
and clear out a drawer.
Thanks.

269
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:04,591
No problem. Try and keep it
in your pants, okay?

270
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,495
So, hi.

271
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:10,597
What's up?

272
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,682
I was wondering if
you're free Friday.

273
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:14,768
They're having a Totally
'80s Night at the Greek.

274
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,603
Hall & Oates,
Katrina and the Waves

275
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,772
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

276
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,640
(chuckles):
Oh.

277
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,692
Gee, that's really sweet,
but the thing is...

278
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:24,678
Aw, there's a thing.

279
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,813
Look, honey, I was really drunk

280
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,532
and made a huge mistake
last night.

281
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,200
We should've never
slept together.

282
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,985
It's what ruins friendships.

283
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:34,237
You can't ruin a friendship
with sex.

284
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:38,258
That's like trying to ruin ice
cream with chocolate sprinkles.

285
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:40,794
Come here.

286
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,129
Just listen to me.

287
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,749
I want to go back
to the way we were before.

288
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,417
You know, friends.

289
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,553
No sprinkles.

290
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:54,124
Oh.

291
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,225
All right.

292
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:57,594
Thank you.

293
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,712
(sighs)

294
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,681
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

295
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:06,570
as your friend, you might
like to know that, um...

296
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:15,278
we didn't have sex in
the conventional sense.

297
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,750
Oh, God.

298
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:24,170
Did you pull some weird
Indian crap on me?

299
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,673
No, no.

300
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,910
After we got undressed
and jumped in bed,

301
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,463
you-you asked if
I had protection.

302
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,848
Oh, you did, didn't you?

303
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,766
Of course. I'm
always packing.

304
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,802
Anyway,

305
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:41,754
um, I had trouble
putting it on

306
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:45,025
and you tried
to help and...

307
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,880
that was all
she wrote.

308
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,570
So, we didn't actually...

309
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:58,571
I did.

310
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,590
It was beautiful.

311
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,829
Oh!

312
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,280
Penny, please,
please promise me

313
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,748
you won't tell
anybody about this.

314
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,283
Of course I won't.
No, I won't.

315
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,252
Oh, good.
(exhales)

316
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:14,020
Um, can I tell
people that our love

317
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,305
burned too bright
and too quickly?

318
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:18,124
Kind of a "Candle
in the Wind" deal?

319
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,175
Sure.

320
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:20,894
Cool. Can I say
it fell apart

321
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,962
because you were all, "I
want to have your babies""

322
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:26,116
and I was like, "I'm too rock
and roll to be tied down"?

323
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:28,685
No.

324
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,656
Can I say I ruined
you for white men?

325
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,277
Also no.

326
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,495
Okay, just the
candle thing.

327
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,646
Yeah.

328
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,365
Cool.

329
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,501
All right... friend.

330
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:45,702
Hmm.

331
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,987
I'll see you around.

332
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:48,872
Okay.

333
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,809
Raj, wait.

334
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,966
Thank you for being my friend.

335
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:01,834
Penny?

336
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:03,019
Mm-hmm?

337
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,471
It's getting
beautiful again.

338
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,643
All right, this is
a Google Earth view

339
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,529
of the field
of battle.

340
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't see anything.

341
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,899
Give it a
second to load.

342
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,683
Whenever you're
ready, AT&T!

343
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,537
Okay, here we go.

344
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:23,123
This is us here.
To the south is Professor Loomis

345
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,491
and the Geology Department.

346
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,327
According to their Twitter feed,
they're out of sunblock,

347
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,748
which means they'll have to hug
the tree line or risk melanoma.

348
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,717
That's our edge.

349
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,369
All we have to do is move
quickly over this ridge,

350
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,754
the rock-worshipping
pasty-faced bastards

351
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:39,038
won't know what hit them!

352
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,224
All right, let's move out.

353
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,144
Hang on, Sheldon.

354
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:48,014
How could you not tell me your
sister was moving back to India?

355
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,433
Maybe he was too busy
writing clumsy penis metaphors

356
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,435
about my fiancée.

357
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:53,570
Screw you.

358
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:56,706
That was a beautifully written
penis metaphor.

359
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:02,612
You know what, guys, I'm not
in the mood for paintball.

360
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:04,414
What do you say
we just bag it?

361
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,166
- Fine with me.
- Sure, whatever.

362
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,567
You can't quit.

363
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,319
That's a court-
martial offense.

364
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,788
That's punishable by...

365
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,706
You can't quit.

366
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,427
Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not
a good time for playing games.

367
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,745
This is a game to you?

368
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:23,016
Uh, was the Battle of Antietam
a game?

369
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:26,136
Huh? Was the sack
of Rome a game?

370
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,755
Yes, no and no.

371
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,057
Wait.

372
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:35,862
I just want you all to know
that I forgive you.

373
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:38,481
This mutiny
isn't your fault,

374
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,433
it's mine.

375
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,619
I haven't earned these bars.

376
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,994
Although what I lack
in leadership,

377
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:54,414
apparently I more than
make up for in sewing.

378
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,449
Let it go, Sheldon.

379
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,802
I'll get you a Jamba Juice
on the way home.

380
00:16:58,804 --> 00:16:59,803
No.

381
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:03,139
Jamba Juice is for heroes.

382
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:07,460
And that's what
we're going to be.

383
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,513
What are you doing?

384
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:15,801
Following in the footsteps
of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

385
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,859
(people shouting in distance)

386
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:32,368
Geology isn't a real science!

387
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,705
(paintball guns popping)

388
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,600
(popping ceases)

389
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,472
Damn those sons
of bitches!

390
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,023
Let's get 'em!

391
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,841
Eat paint!

392
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,478
(yelling)

393
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,032
If there's ever
a Church of Sheldon,

394
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,685
this will be when it started.

395
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:06,653
(paintball guns popping)

396
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,339
Ow!

397
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,191
I'd like to
propose a toast

398
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:15,795
to the man whose noble
sacrifice inspired our victory,

399
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:17,547
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

400
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:19,082
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

401
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:21,918
Excuse me.
It's <i>Major</i> Sheldon Cooper.

402
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,036
With my last breath,

403
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:27,340
I awarded myself
a battlefield promotion.

404
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,475
It's kind of a big deal.

405
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,261
(knock on door)

406
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:34,230
Hi. You guys have a minute?

407
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,050
Uh, yeah, sure.

408
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,686
Okay.

409
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,321
Um...
(clears throat)

410
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,823
Well, I already talked to Raj,
but I wanted to apologize

411
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,108
to the rest of you for,

412
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,994
you know, everything.

413
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,662
Please, Penny, let me.
(clears throat)

414
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:54,450
We've decided to let our crazy,
wonderful night together

415
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:57,170
be just one of those
memories you have

416
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:59,289
and can call to mind
when you're feeling blue

417
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,391
or you're in the shower.

418
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,428
Hey, what you doing,
Quick Draw?

419
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:12,802
Sorry. Go on.

420
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,437
(clears throat)

421
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,223
Anyways, I wanted you guys all
to know that I've been taking

422
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,193
a really hard look at things
and come to the conclusion

423
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,111
I have to stop kidding myself.

424
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,197
I suck at acting.

425
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,866
It's time for me
to move back to Nebraska.

426
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,768
You're leaving?

427
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,069
Yeah.

428
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:32,038
What are you
going to do in Nebraska?

429
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,907
I don't know,
maybe teach acting.

430
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:35,959
(cell phone ringing)

431
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,877
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

432
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,329
Hello?

433
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,114
Penny, listen, I hope you're not
doing this 'cause of you and me,

434
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,450
because I have a girlfriend,
and you're a single woman...

435
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,618
Shh! It's my agent,
it's my agent.

436
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,919
You're kidding.

437
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,887
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,722
I can't believe it!
Really?!

439
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,790
Oh, I'm so excited!

440
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:51,758
Thank you!

441
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,976
Thank you so much.

442
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:54,260
Okay, bye.

443
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,762
I got the hemorrhoid commercial!

444
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:56,946
I start Monday!

445
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,683
What about Nebraska?

446
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:01,684
Oh, hell with Nebraska.

447
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm gonna be a star!

448
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:04,887
(door closes)

449
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,323
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

450
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:14,447
Have you ever thought
of teaching physics?

451
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,827
Ready to ride?

452
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:26,578
I don't think
so, Mom.

453
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,296
Not today.

454
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:29,548
Oh, sweetie.

455
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,883
Hemorrhoids acting up again?

456
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:34,035
You don't know the half of it.

457
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:36,204
Oh, yes, I do.

458
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,673
Try a dab of this.

459
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:44,095
"Rose-scented
Preparation-H for women?"

460
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:48,366
Now, the "H" is for "her."

461
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,872
I'm proud of you.

462
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:54,806
Shh!

463
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,974
Here comes
my joke.

464
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,943
How you doing?

465
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:01,563
Sittin' pretty.
