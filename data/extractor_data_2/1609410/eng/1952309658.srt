1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,000
Having a little trouble
catching your breath there?

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,100
No, no, I'm good.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
If my P.E. teachers had told me
this is what I was training for,

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,700
I would have tried
a lot harder.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
"Do or do not.
There is no try."

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,500
Did you just quote Star Wars?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,600
I believe I quoted
Empire Strikes Back.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,900
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm lying in bed
with a beautiful woman

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
who can quote Yoda.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,000
I love you, Penny.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,900
Oh...

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,300
Thank you.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
You're welcome.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,500
I just wanted
to put that out there.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I'm-I'm glad.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,400
Good.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Glad is good.
Yeah.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,900
Yeah...

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,800
No, no...

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,400
Um...

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,600
So, it's getting
pretty late.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,500
We should probably
go to sleep. Yeah.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Okay.
Yeah, probably.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,900
Okay, good night, sweetie.
Good night.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,800
âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,100
âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
âª The Earth began to cool âª

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,300
âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,900
âª We built the Wall âª
âª We built the pyramids âª

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
âª That all started
with a big bang âª

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,800
âª Bang! âª

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,900
Hey, Leonard, where
do you come down on giant ants?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Sheldon says impossible.

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,300
Howard and I say
not only possible,

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than a Batmobile.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,100
You are ignoring
the square-cube law.

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,500
The giant ant would be crushed

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,300
under the weight
of its own exoskeleton.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,700
And for the record,

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,400
the appropriate ranking of cool
modes of transportation is:

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
jet pack, hoverboard,
transporter, Batmobile,

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,900
and then giant ant.

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,400
Seriously?

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,800
You have nothing better to do

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,800
than sit around and discuss
the possibility of giant ants?

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
What's with him?

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Perhaps he's at a sensitive
point in his monthly cycle.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,100
Are you saying
he's man-strating?

53
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,900
Not literally.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,400
But as far back
as the 17th century,

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,400
scientists observed
a 33-day fluctuation

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,800
in men's hormone levels.

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Interesting.

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,400
That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,100
You know what I'm talking about.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
Okay, forget
giant ants.

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,500
How about giant rabbits?

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Big or small,
I don't like rabbits.

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
They always look like they're
about to say something,

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
but they never do.

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Rabbits do have
a respiratory system

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
that would support great size.

67
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,600
And on a side note, they
are one of the few mammals

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,900
whose scrotum is in front
of the penis.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,500
Maybe that's what
they want to talk about.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,900
Leonard, where do you
stand on giant rabbits

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
and scrotal position?

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,900
I honestly don't care.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Really?

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,100
Because every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals,

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
you've always had
some pretty strong

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,100
and controversial opinions.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,500
What do you want from me?

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,500
I just don't give a rat's ass.

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Would that be a giant rat's ass?

80
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,800
For the record,
giant rats are possible.

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,600
Can we please talk
about something else?

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,600
Maybe something vaguely related

83
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
to life as we know it
on this planet?

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,700
Okay, how about this
for a topic:

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,300
Why is Leonard being
a giant douche?

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Assuming giant douches
are possible.

87
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,300
Of course they are.

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,300
Leonard's being one.

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,300
Maybe he's having
a lover's spat with Penny.

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
No, there was no spat.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,300
Oh, but something happened.

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,700
I don't want to talk about it.

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,700
But I sense you're going to and
I don't want to hear about it.

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Excuse me.

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,200
What'd you do, Romeo?

96
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,200
You pour maple syrup
all over your body

97
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,500
and ask her if she was in
the mood for a short stack?

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Did you think it would be funny
to put on a pair of her panties

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,200
and jump around, but it wound up
just creeping her out?

100
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,700
What? No.

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm just asking, dude.

102
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
It happens.

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,100
You guys still on
for bowling tonight?

104
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,500
Oh, yes.

105
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
In fact, I've prepared some
trash talk for the occasion.

106
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,200
You bowl like your mama.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Unless, of course,
she bowls well.

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,300
In which case,
you bowl nothing like her.

109
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,700
Oh. Ouch.

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
That is what is referred
to as a burn on you.

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Did you ask her
to start waxing?

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,700
No.

113
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
Did you start waxing?

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
No.

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,500
While making love,

116
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
did you accidentally
spank your own ass

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,800
and cry out, "Mommy"?

118
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm walking away from you now.

119
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,000
That wasn't a no.

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, I think
we're getting close.

121
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,700
Did you take a Benadryl and fall
asleep while pleasuring her?

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Because you can die that way.

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh, that would be
a good way to go.

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,900
Hi.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,900
Oh, hey.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Good, Penny.

127
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
bowling tonight
at 7:00.

128
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, right, bowling.

129
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

130
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
No, no, it's okay.

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I mean, let's face it, you guys
would get creamed without me.

132
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
We would indeed.

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,900
In this particular case,

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,900
your lack of femininity
works to our advantage.

135
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,500
It's always nice
chatting with you, Sheldon.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,500
Sarcasm?

137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Thinly veiled contempt.

138
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
7:00.
Got it.

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Pacific Daylight time!
Bite me!

140
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,800
Please reserve that butch spirit
for the lanes.

141
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,500
I thought you were bringing
your own bowling shoes.

142
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
These are my own bowling shoes.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Then what's with
the disinfectant?

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
I know where my feet have been.

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Hey, Penny!

146
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
And you guys.

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute.

148
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
I believe some of you know

149
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,300
Wil Wheaton.

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,100
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

151
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
Well, well, well.

152
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
If it isn't Wil Wheaton,

153
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,300
the Green Goblin
to my Spider-Man.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
the Pope Paul V
to my Galileo,

155
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,500
the Internet Explorer
to my Firefox.

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,300
You're not still
carrying a grudge

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,300
because I beat you at
that card tournament, are you?

158
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,700
I'm the proud owner

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,900
of WilWheatonstinks.com,.net,
and.org.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
What does that tell you?

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,200
It tells me that I am
living rent-free right here.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
You ready to bowl?

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
Oh, I'm ready.

164
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know if Stuart told you
what you're up against tonight,

165
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
but before you stands
the co-captain of the

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,000
East Texas Christian Youth
Holy Roller Bowling League championship team.

167
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,200
Seven- to 12-year-old division.

168
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,700
Also, Penny's
pretty good.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Great. Then it's on.

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton,
it was never off.

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes!

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
A common spare.

173
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700
The Miss Congeniality
of the bowling pageant.

174
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,900
Before you jump
on Twitter

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,300
to tout your modest
accomplishment,

176
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,700
watch how it's really done.

177
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
I am the ball.

178
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
My thoughts are its thoughts.

179
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Its holes are my holes.

180
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes.

181
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
Tweet that,
Tweety Bird.

182
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey, I just wanted
to tell you

183
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,300
I'm a big fan.

184
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh, thanks.

185
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm sure you're probably sick
of Star Trek questions,

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
but Whoopi Goldberg--
you ever hit that?

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Ah, beer.

188
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,900
The magic elixir that can turn
this poor, shy Indian boy

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
into the life of the party.

190
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,800
Oh, yeah.

191
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Chili cheese fry?

192
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,200
Yes. I love
chili cheese fries.

193
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
Really? You love them?

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Yeah, why?

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No reason.
I'm just glad to hear

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,700
you're comfortable saying
you love something.

197
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,100
Do you really want to get
into this right now?

198
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
Get into what?

199
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Why wouldn't you love
the chili cheese fries?

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
They've been in your
life a long time.

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
They make you happy.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,100
They deserve to know.

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Look, you just caught me
by surprise last night.

204
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,600
I didn't know what to say.

205
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,600
Okay, well, now you've had
some time to think about it.

206
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,800
So, what do you want to say?

207
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm not sure.

208
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
How can you not be sure?

209
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, this isn't the place
to have this conversation.

210
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,300
No, the place to have
the conversation was in bed

211
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
after I said, "I love yo""

212
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
and you said, "Thank you.
Good night""

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't push it, Leonard.

214
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,900
I am not pushing anything.
You are.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,900
You don't get to decide when
I'm ready to say "I love you!"

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Ah, the premature
"I love you."

217
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,700
I guessed "premature."
Does that count?

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Penny.

219
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Penny.

220
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,900
Penny.

221
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,600
What?

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
This is for you.

223
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Ice cream?

224
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,800
I've been familiarizing myself
with female emotional crises

225
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,200
by studying the
comic strip Cathy.

226
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,400
When she's upset, she says,
"Ack!" and eats ice cream.

227
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Um...

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Ack!

229
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,800
If you were a cat, I would have
brought you a lasagna.

230
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,200
Did Leonard send you over here?

231
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,900
No, we haven't spoken

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
since your abrupt departure
last night

233
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
caused us to forfeit to Stuart

234
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
and his dastardly ringer
Wil Wheaton.

235
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

236
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,300
I'm not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Again, I'm sorry.

238
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,600
And let me tell you,
sleep did not

239
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
come easily with Leonard
in the next room

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
singing along
with Alanis Morrisette.

241
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,700
You're kidding.

242
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
No. Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

243
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
All right, Sheldon,
what part of this

244
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,700
is supposed to make me
feel better?

245
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,300
The part where
I tell you

246
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,700
I've engineered a rematch

247
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
with Stuart's team
for tonight.

248
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Oh, honey, I don't know.

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,900
Things are a little weird
with Leonard right now.

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You want me to remove
him from the team?

251
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm the captain.
I can do that.

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,500
No, no, that's okay.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Just let me talk to him,
and I'll get back to you.

254
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,800
When are you going
to talk to him?

255
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

256
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,300
He's in the laundry room now.
Now woulbe a good time.

257
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,600
You're not gonna leave me alone
until I do it, are you?

258
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

259
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,600
I think we should
talk now.

260
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Wha...? No, it's okay.

261
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,900
We don't have to talk 'cause
there's nothing to talk about.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Everything's good.

263
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Really?

264
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
So, you didn't get all snarky

265
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,400
'cause I said somethingice
to a bowl of chili fries?

266
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
All right, maybe I overreacted.

267
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,900
So we're in two different places
emotionally. So what?

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,900
And maybe I'm a little ahead
of you. That's fine.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,700
In fact, it makes sense,
'cause let's face it,

270
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,700
I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,900
Look, Leonard, you have
how much I care about you.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
It's just that I've
said the "L" word

273
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,100
too soon before, and it
didn't work out very well.

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,700
Really?

275
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
I wouldn't know
what that's like.

276
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,600
You know what I'm
talking about, though.

278
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,500
Yeah, I do.

279
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
So, we're good?

280
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,600
Yes, that's what
I'm telling you.

281
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
We are good. We are great.

282
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
All right! Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,100
Time to bowl!

284
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, I was eavesdropping.

285
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
There's a lot at stake here.

286
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
Attention, all bowlers:

287
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,400
I've taken the liberty of having
these made for our rematch.

288
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,200
"The Wesley Crushers"?

289
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,600
No, not The Wesley Crushers.

290
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,800
The Wesley Crushers.

291
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't get it.

292
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,200
Wesley Crusher was

293
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

294
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,300
Still don't get it.

295
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,700
It's a blindingly clever play
on words.

296
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S,

297
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,100
we imply that we we'll be
the crushers of Wesley.

298
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
Okay, I'm sorry, honey,

299
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,400
but The Wesley Crushers sounds
like a bunch of people

300
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,600
who like Wesley Crusher.

301
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,800
No! Again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

302
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,500
It's the Wesley Crushers.

303
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,100
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley,

304
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
it'd be the Wesley Crushers.

305
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
Do you people even hear
yourselves?

306
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

307
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,100
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

308
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
It's The Wesley Crushers.

309
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Hey, look.

310
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
They named their team after me.

311
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
No, it's not the...

312
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,900
Never mind.

313
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,000
So, we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

314
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Oh, yes. The losers will be
publicly humiliated

315
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,100
in a fashion to be chosen
by the victor.

316
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,900
I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
expounding the discredited
Velikovsky hypothesis.

318
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
Ouch again.

319
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,900
Hey, Sheldon,

320
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,300
I just wanted you to know

321
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,300
that I'm really looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
Oh, yes?

323
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,300
Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

324
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Is your mother
a good or poor bowler?

325
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
After you.

326
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,800
No, after you... as we are

327
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,700
currently crushing you, Wesley.

328
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
It's customary

329
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,100
for the player on the right-hand
lane to bowl first.

330
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
All right.

331
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,300
It's a custom, not a rule.

332
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
I so loathe you.

333
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
That's right, Sheldon.

334
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,200
Embrace the dark side.

335
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,100
That's not even
from your franchise!

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,900
I, um, I want you
to know that

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,300
even though we're
on opposite sides,

338
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,600
I, I bear you no ill will.

339
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank you, Stuart.
It's nice to know.

340
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

341
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,900
People from
opposite sides

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
often have good
relationships.

343
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
You know,
Romeo and Juliet...

344
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Tony and Maria
from West Side Story,

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,100
what's-his-name and the
big blue chick in Avatar.

346
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm gonna bowl now.

347
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,000
Be the ball, Howard.

348
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,700
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
You weren't the ball.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,600
Hey, thanks.

351
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
This is fun, huh?

352
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah.

353
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,200
It's good that we got out
and did something physical.

354
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,700
Mm-hmm.
Gets us out of our heads.

355
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
You get in your head,

356
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,900
you start to overthink,
overanalyze,

357
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
obsess, you worry.

358
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,700
That's not what
we're doing tonight.

359
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,700
Tonight we're just throwing
a ball at some pins.

360
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,900
Mm-hmm, and someday--
we don't know when--

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,700
maybe you'll love me back.

363
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Ooh, I'm up.

364
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,000
ALL Shel-don! Shel-don!
Shel-don! Shel-don!

365
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
Excuse me.

366
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,100
I don't know who you're chanting
for as I am currently the ball.

367
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
The ball! The ball!

368
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,400
The ball! The ball!
The ball! The ball!

369
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,300
Thank you, Jesus!

370
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,400
As my mother would say.

371
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm glad you
patched things up

372
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,900
with your boyfriend.

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh, yeah, me, too.

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's always tough when
the "L" bomb gets dropped

375
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,600
and you're not
ready for it.

376
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Tell me about it.

377
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,900
I dated this one girl,

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
and I told her
that I loved her,

379
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,100
and she said
she wasn't sure.

380
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
And she strung me along
for almost two years.

381
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,300
It was brutal.

382
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,500
Thanks.

384
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,400
I wish she had just broken up
with me right there,

385
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,900
and put me out
of my misery.

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,900
Really?

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah, would have
been kinder.

388
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
Wil, you're up.

389
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,300
Oh, that's me.

390
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,400
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

391
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,700
What are you talking about?

392
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,500
He's evil.
He plays evil mind games.

393
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Did he tell you
his grandmother died?

394
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,400
No!

395
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,200
Well, if he does,
don't believe it.

396
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,000
He's not above playing
the dead meemaw card.

397
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Yes!

398
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton,

399
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
but like your time
on Star Trek: Next Generation,

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,500
your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

401
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Penny, you're up.

402
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,100
All right, remember,
his meemaw's alive

403
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,300
and be the ball.

404
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Yeah, I got it.

405
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
We really need
a strike here.

406
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,700
I know.

407
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
So just take your time
and concentrate.

408
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,500
Leonard, stop pressuring me.

409
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm not pressuring you.

410
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,500
Yeah, you are!
Just back off!

411
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, I'm sorry.

412
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,400
I'll shut up.

413
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
I didn't mean "shut up."

414
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,900
Fine. Just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
No...

416
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
this isn't fair

417
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,700
to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.

418
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
Wait! Where are you going?

419
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Penny, come back!

420
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll get you ice cream!

421
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
No, let her go.

422
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Are you insane?

423
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
If she leaves, it's over!

424
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm pretty sure
it's already over.

425
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,800
Tough luck, Sheldon.

426
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,600
You did this, didn't you?

427
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,800
Do you think I would
really break up a couple

428
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,200
just to win
a bowling match?

429
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,600
No, I suppose not.

430
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Good. Keep thinking that.

431
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,900
Whea-ton!

432
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,600
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah,
I'm telling you,

433
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,100
the Match.com chicks are much
looser than on eHarmony.

434
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,300
You know,
I-I gotta call you back.

435
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,000
I won a bet,
and it's time to collect.

436
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,600
I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.
