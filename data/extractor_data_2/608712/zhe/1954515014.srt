1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,180
上帝为男人和女人造了花园并且告诉他们...
God made a garden for Man and Woman and he told them...

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,770
"不要吃那树上的果."
'"Do not eat of the fruit from that tree.'"

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,410
一条蛇来到女人面前建议她摘树上的苹果.
A serpent visited the Woman and offered her an apple from the tree.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,650
他告诉她苹果能给她带来知识.
He told her the apple would give her knowledge.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,620
他非常有说服力...
He was very persuasive...

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,690
人类自此便多灾多难
and Mankind has been paying the price ever since.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,010
全都是因为我们总强求一些我们根本不需要的东西
All because we were tempted by something we didn't need.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,570
而蛇说出了历史上第一次的谎话
The serpent was the first grifter.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,530
Terry,最近怎么样?又是我 Chazz啊
Yo,Terry,what's going on?It's Chazz again.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,450
那就最好了
Yeah,that'll be great.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,050
Terry,你要等一下 我妈妈打电话给我 我得先接一下
Yeah,Terry,gotta put you on hold,it's my mom on the other line.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,440
可能她腰痛又犯了
Probably her hip again.One sec.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,890
Hyotona先生,你好
Mr.Hyotona,konnichiwa.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,210

Yes,the artifact is with me now.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,890
你当然能先看一下 但是没多少时间喔
Of course you can see it but time is of the essence.

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,440
我在等一些意大利石雕板
I'm expecting a consignment of Italian lithographs...

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,160
都装在些不同的箱子里面 当然都没记号的了
all arriving this afternoon in identical boxes,unmarked of course.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,290
Emmerick的电话 Jensen先生 我马上给你转接
Mr.Emmerick's phone.Mr.Jensen,I'll put you right through.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,610
Hyotona先生,你能先等一下吗 马德里那边的客户给我来电话了
Yes,Mr.Hyotona,I'll have to place you on hold.It's my Madrid dealer.

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,730
Jensen先生
Mr.Jensen.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,810
还有另外一个拍卖会 我想你会感兴趣的
I'm afraid there's another interested party.

24
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,730
公元600年摩西五经的原版手抄本
Well,an original,illuminated,6th century transcript...

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,290
这可是难得的机会啊 肯定要引起轰动的
of the Pentateuchal books of the Bible is bound to generate a lot of buzz.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,850
你见过那手抄本吗
You've seen the Photostats?

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,730
其中有几页连原版福音书也没办法比的
Some of these pictures put even the Book of Kells to shame.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,890
什么 你没见过?
What's that?You haven't seen them?

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,370
我助手 Jackson博士没跟你在一起吗?
My associate,Professor Jackson,isn't with you?

30
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,490
他妈的Jackson博士在哪?
Ash,where is Professor sodding Jackson?

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,280
Albert 不见人了 我找不到他
Albert hasn't shown.I can't raise him.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,370
我想他没去找你肯定是有原因的
I'm sure there's a very good reason why he's not with you.

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,370
Albert没出现
Albert's not turned up.

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,210
等一下Jensen先生 我的助理刚进来
One moment please,Mr.Jensen,my PA has just walked in.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,610
Albert没出现?什么意思?
What do you mean he's not turned up?

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,290
就是他没去罗
He ain't there,okay?

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,890
他不见踪影 怎么也找不到他
He's a no- show,Mickey.The street is an Albert- free zone.

38

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,530
捐献点吧?
For the poor?

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,570
你没事吧
Are you troubled,my son?

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,810
我想我今天看到了未来
I think I saw the future today.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,290
上帝有时是会指引我们 让我们看到我们要走的路
God sometimes gives us glimpses of the path we are traveling.

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,050
我以前总以为我知道自己要干什么
I always thought I knew just where I was headed.

46
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,730
事实上
Truth is,Sister...

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,810
但我其实是不清楚的
now I'm not so sure.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,570
别灰心
Do not despair.

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,050
希望在明天嘛
There is always hope.

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,490
我不是灰心 我只是不大相信希望这玩意
I don't mean to split hairs,Sister,but I don't believe in hope exactly.

51
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,930
我相信的是机会
I prefer to call it chance.

52
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,970
应该抓紧的机会
And a chance has to be grabbed.

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,770
你有什么事
What's your problem,my son?

54
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,730
我不是虔诚的基督徒
I'm not a churchgoer,Father.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,570
但我妻子是
The wife's a big fan,though.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,010
她让我来一下
She told me to light a candle to Saint Marie of the Incarnation.

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,290
只要你能帮我 不管什么神佛我都相信
I'll bend the knee to any statue you like.But you have got to help me.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
飞天大盗 第2季第2集
S02E02 Confessions

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,770
Albie.我们很担心你呢
Albie.We were worried.

60
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,530
你是我护士啊 这么紧张?我没事啊
What are you,my nurse?I'm fine.

61
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,610
有个好消息跟一个坏消息
Look,there's bad news and there's good news.

62
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,130
你没去那 我们丢了那笔生意
When you didn't show,the marks lost their bottle.

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,410
那坏消息你们知道了
So you've had the bad,then.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,450
- 你去哪了 - 我们真的很担心你啊
- Where the hell were you? - We were worried.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,530
Albie,你要放我们鸽子 也不要在这个时候啊
Albie,if you want to go off-piste,at least let the rest of us know.

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,850
我也不想那样的
This one has always been a no-no.

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,490
我也觉得很对不起你们
I've had a bad feeling from the off.

68
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,490
好了好了 那好消息是什么
Okay,so what's the good news?

69
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,330
Keyes.我认识他
Johnny Keyes.Keyes.Oh,yeah.I know him.

70
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,090
出生贫民区 是个心狠手辣的人喔
Proper hard man.Proper East End,he is.

71
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,240
我还以为他只是个厨师
I thought he was a chef.

72
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,970
'"厨房皇帝'" 我老婆有那本书
'"The Kitchen King.'" Yeah,my missus had that book.

73
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,130
那就是说你在教堂见到一个很会炒菜的厨子罗
So you saw a fancy chef in a church.

74
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,090
不会这么无聊吧
Whoopee diddley doo!

75
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,650
不是厨师 我见到的是一个有权有势的人
No.I saw a powerful,arrogant thug.

76
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,290
他有钱得要命 可又烦得要死
With cash in his pockets and desperation in his eyes.

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,250
他烦什么?
What's he got to be desperate about?

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,090
他出生贫民窟 打家劫舍 白手兴家
He grew up on the streets,robbing houses,talking with his fists.

79
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,560
对了 还抢过银行
Yeah,not to mention turning over a couple of banks.

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,930
不是一两次喔 是很多次啊
And he did time for that.A lot of time.

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,920
有人说他就该判终身监禁
Some say they should have thrown away the key.

82
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,490
那人骨子里就是个恶魔
This man was evil personified.

83
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,130
我在监狱里也是跟他们一样
Inside I was just like the rest of them.A nobody.

84
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,530
无聊时还不时帮帮厨子打杂
I did kitchen detail just to pass the time at first.

85
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,210
后来却真的成了兴趣
But then it got into my blood.

86
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,290
我拼命的学习厨艺
And I was devouring books.Hungry to learn.

87
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,010
开始有了些名气
Cooking for the big men.

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,450
他出狱后买下一家餐馆
So he gets out of prison and buys a restaurant with a bag of gold bullion.

89
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,840
- 现在就经营着K's - K's.
- And now of course,he runs K's. - K's.

90
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,400
那里现在要订个位子难死了
Who do you have to kill to get a table in there these days?

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,450
他说是怕我被人杀了
He said it's in case I get a puncture.

92
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,090
那他还烦什么
So why is he desperate?

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,810
很多人都忘了他还有个孩子
What most people have forgotten is the story of James.

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,410
叫James的
His son.

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,330
1974年,他那一岁的孩子被绑架
In 1974,his one- year-old son was kidnapped.

96
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,970
之后就再也没有音信了
Never to be heard or seen again.

97
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,330
我当时树敌很多
I had a lot of enemies in those days.

98
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,890
我也不知道是谁带走了他
But I'll never know which bastard took him.

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,370
我付不起赎金 我哪有那么多钱
I couldn't pay what they wanted.I didn't have the ransom,all right?

100
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,410
我得找他
I've got to find him.

101
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,010
希望还来得及
Before it's too late.

102
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,080
那个Keyes得病了
Keyes is sick.

103
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,970
心脏病 说不定哪天自己就挂掉了 当然想找回个继承人
A bum ticker.He wants to find his heir before they stick him in the ground.

104
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,570
James现在该32岁了
James would be 32 now.

105
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,930
你想找人冒充他儿子
So you're talking birthrights...

106
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,690
你就是想这么做吧
inheritance,that's your angle,is it?

107
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,170
不好意思打断一下 不过做他孩子还真是可怜
Sorry,but stinging some guy who's still grieving over his long lost son?

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,770
别同情他
Don't shed one tear for him,my dear.

109
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,210
那人本身就害人不浅了
The guy's a nasty piece of work.

110
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,570
我觉得他就在我附近
I got a feeling in my bones that he's close.

111
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,000
我会给钱他
I got money for him.

112
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,570
让他搞搞生意什么的
Plenty to help him make something of himself,the way I did.

113
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,490
如果用钱能补偿他
If I could give him the money...

114
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,010
我就给他钱
least then I'd feel I'd done something for him.

115
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,010
那又怎样呢
Now what?

116
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,770
我想让他跟他孩子"团聚"
I think we should reunite him with his long lost son.

117
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,210
Albert.
Albert.

118
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,130
你今天去教堂干吗?
What the hell were you doing in a church today?

119
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,690
今天下午Gil Stewart死了
Gil Stewart died this afternoon.

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,530
我一直陪着他
I was there at the end.

121
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,050
不是吧 死了?你跟他好得就像两兄弟
Oh,God.I'm so sorry,Albert.You two were like brothers.

122
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,210
我们在拉斯维加斯就开始合作
We worked Vegas together.

123
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,900
他人好聪明的
That man was made for bright lights.

124
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,810
可惜啊
Poor bastard.

125
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,170
他在牙科医院 中风死了
Died of a stroke in a dental surgery.

126
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,850
我们该起诉那医生
Well,someone should sue them.

127
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,930
他就是那冒牌医生
He was pretending to be the dentist.

128
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,010
他死前
Before he died...

129
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,130
把这交给我
he gave me this.

130
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,440
他的结婚戒指
His wedding ring.

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,280
做了这么多年骗子
All those years of hard grift...

132
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,850
他死的时候却拿着个电动牙刷
and he dies holding a bottle of plaque remover.

133
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,410
我要是死了
When I die,Mickey...

134
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,410
你得往我口袋塞满钱
I want my pockets to be filled with cash.

135
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,010
把Keyes的钱骗到手吧 Michael
Let's take Keyes' money,Michael.

136
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,650
那么
So.

137
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,770
给他弄个败家子 你看怎样
How do you feel about playing the prodigal son then?

138
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,530
好吧?
Well?

139
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,330
Stacie 起起Keyes的老底.
Stacie,find out as much as possible about Keyes'past.

140
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,250
越了解他才越能使他相信Danny是他儿子
The details will help convince him that Danny is his son.

141
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,810
这些旧新闻是说有个凶悍的匪徒
These old articles talk about a vicious armed robber...

142
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,650
勒索 抢劫 无恶不作
into everything from extortion to protection rackets.

143
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,730
但他一出狱 洗手不干了
But once Keyes gets out of jail,he reinvents himself.

144
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,450
一转眼就成了个厨师
Suddenly he's about as dangerous as Delia Smith.

145
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,770
我想谁也有些事不见得人的
Well,I reckon she's got a dark side.

146
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,290
来点三文鱼?
Salmon nibble?

147
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,810
有人说他骗了他老朋友的钱
One theory is that he swindled some of his old compadres out of money.

148
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,410
所以那次绑架应该是仇家报复
The kidnap was revenge.

149
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,130
好的 那有什么特别
Okay.So how do we usually get a mark?

150
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,770
他们都吝啬的狠
We appeal to their greed.

151
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,050
那家伙特意不给赎金的 对吧
This bloke's not looking to make money,is he?

152
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,440
他就那样让孩子给人带走算了
He's looking to give it away.

153
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,010
我们这次玩玩亲情戏罗
So we spin him a sob story.

154
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,570
那够了吗?
Will that be enough?

155
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,440
咱们要使他心甘情愿给我们送钱啊
You see giving Danny the money has to be his idea.

156
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,490
你那是什么
What you got in there?

157
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,530
中午吃的肉 看看
Got luncheon meat.Obviously.

158
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,090
- 都快坏掉了 - 对啊 我就爱这样的味道
- That's on the turn. - Yeah,that's how I like it.

159
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,450
跟Albert一起的是谁?
Who's Albert with?

160
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,610
- 他的新朋友 - 是吗
- His new best friends. - Oh,yeah.

161
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,730
是今天早上他碰到的一些的士司机
Yeah,bunch of cab drivers he met this morning.

162
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,210
三个Q
Three jacks.

163
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,530
- 好大的牌喔 - 对啊 是很大
- Happens to the best of them. - Yeah.It does.

164
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,450
四个皇
Four kings.

165
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,730
你输了 老人家
You lose,old-timer.

166
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,370
- 再来吗? - 今天不了
- Go again? - Soon.I hope.

167
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,130
他赌了好几把了吧
So,he's had a few,then?

168
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,210
对啊 来好久了
Yeah.He's been here a while.

169
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,850
虎落平原被犬欺啊
A rose in a bed of thorns.

170
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,410
还没干完这事之前不要再赌了
We keep away from blokes on a hot streak unless we got another deck up our sleeve.

171
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,940
Albert?
Albert?

172
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,650
听着 兄弟 你再怎么赌Gil也不会死而复生
Look,mate,gambling's not going to bring Gil back.

173
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,530
你打电话给Keyes没?
Have you called Keyes yet?

174
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,130
没有 我不想预约 我得跟Keyes谈谈
No,I don't wish to make a reservation.I wish to speak to Mr.Keyes.

175
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,210
我是O'Brien神父
Yeah,Father O'Brien.

176
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,010
当然不会有像红酒那样香醇的东西
Of course there's nothing like a wine tasting en primeur.

177
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,890
我刚从Burgundy回来
I've just come back from a chateau in Burgundy.

178
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,960
那真是高级享受
Top stuff.

179
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,520
不行
No.

180
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,280
当然 这是很浪费的
Of course,it's all bloody show.Still.

181
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,010
但我可是嗜酒如命啊
I'm a sucker for the grape.

182
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,890
你刚才说你是谁?
Who'd you say you were again?

183
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,890
Chris.
Chris.

184
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,850
Family Ties是我开的 我们帮人去找回失散得亲人
I run Family Ties.We help reunite estranged families.

185
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,730
我一点都不懂得品酒
I don't know anything about wine.

186
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,770
这国家只有200人懂得品酒
Only about 200 people in this country do.

187
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,370
Sammy厉害得一个顶他们三个
Sammy here accounts for about three of them.

188
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,290
是神父叫你来的
So the priest sent you,then?

189
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,570
他三年前就给我们打过电话
He called us about three years ago.

190
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,810
他当时想找自己的家人
Trying to locate his real family.

191
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,930
我现在想说是你的儿子 James
I'm talking about James.Your son.

192
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,690
我知道很难要你相信 但请听我说
I know this is difficult,but please believe me when I say...

193
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,570
不可能
There's no way.

194
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,280
神父就打了一个电话 就找到我儿子了?这么简单?
The priest makes one call and finds my son just like that?

195
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,730
好吧
All right.

196
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,850
你准备好了就给我电话吧
Call us when you're ready.

197
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,090
你好 是求职中介吗?
Hello,is that Jobseekers?

198
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,530
我想找一批人
Yes,I'm wondering if you could help me.I'm looking for some enthusiastic...

199
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,370
要懂得电话礼仪的 要很有热情的
candidates with a very good telephone manner.

200
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,930
James三岁开始就开始被不同的人领养
James has been in and out of foster homes since he was three.

201
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,050
还被贩卖给一对不能生育的夫妇
He was illegally sold to a childless couple...

202
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,490
但是他们后来又改变主意 违弃了他
who had a change of heart and abandoned him.

203
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,970
当时应该会有人发现他是你儿子的 但很可惜 没有
He should have been identified as your son,but unfortunately he wasn't.

204
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,090
我不相信你们找到他了
I don't buy that you've found him.

205
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,770
是他找到 Keyes先生
He found you,Mr.Keyes.

206
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,730
很久前的事了
Quite some time ago.

207
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,330
要不是O'Brien神父给我们电话
He didn't know if you'd want to see him.But when Father O'Brien called us...

208
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,090
他才不知道你会不会认他呢
that's when James knew.

209
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,250
我会联系你的
I'll be in touch.

210
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,210
我希望这场现场演练能
I hope this brief role-play has given you some idea...

211
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,680
让你体会到你将来的工作环境
of the environment you'd be expected to work in.

212
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,450
Starkey先生会给你们发一些面试题目 你们完成它 交好 就可以离开
Mr.Starkey will hand out questionnaires.Please hand them back as you leave.

213
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,810
我们会在你们之中挑选两位 一有消息我们就会通知你们
And we'll be in touch with the lucky two we've chosen in due course.

214
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,170
非常感谢你们到来
Thank you for your time.

215
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,570
那是什么?
What is that?

216
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,730
不要打开橱柜看喔
Don't look in the cupboard.

217
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,610
它不会跳出来吓我一跳吧
Is it gonna jump out?

218
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,650
- 上帝啊 - 都告诉你不要了
- Jesus! - I warned you.

219
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,650
不然你以为放个空气清新机在这干吗
What do you think the air freshener's are for?

220
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,890
Albie.
Albie.

221
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,850
葬礼我们就不要去了
Nobody's going to the funeral.

222
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,930
但是Gil会喜欢这的
But,Gil would have loved this.

223
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,930
他墓碑上名字写的是Benedict Doonan.
He's being buried under the name of Benedict Doonan.

224
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,770
死的时候是冒牌牙医 所以只能用那名
Died a dentist.Buried a dentist.

225
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,010
他的墓碑上还不能写自己的名字?
So he doesn't get his own name on his headstone?

226
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,730
- 不是吧 - 有什么关系
- Bummer. - What does it matter?

227
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,650
会有谁会悼念他?
Who's gonna be there to cry for him?

228
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,850
干吗发那么大火
What's eating Gilbert Grape?

229
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,530
他不会承认 但是他的确很难过的
Well,he won't admit it,but it's grief.

230
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,210
你好,这是Chris

Okay,cheers.

233
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,330
是Keyes的律师
That was Keyes' lawyer.

234
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,210
他们想要做DNA测试
They want a blood test.

235
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,410

236
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,050

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,930
没听说有人要进行移植手术啊
I wasn't told of a transplant.

239
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,690
好的 对不起 如果你不要动手术
Yeah,well sorry,love,but seeing as you're not doing the operation...

240
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,290
那是不是他们也不要呢?
maybe they didn't make you a priority.Which floor?

241
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,370
- 恐怕我还是不能让你进去 - 好的
- I'm afraid I can't let you through until... - Right.Okay.

242
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,160
楼上有个病号 他脸色疮白 就等着这东西
There's a fella upstairs the same color as a canary and he's waiting for one of these.

243
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,530
一开始手术 机器一开 就帮他换好肝了
On a slab.On a drip.Cut open.With a little machine doing the job of his liver for him.

244
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,240
那你要让他再等我去拿我的清单吗
You want to ask him if he minds hanging on a bit while I go and get my clipboard?

245
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,130
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,090
刚好你来了
Staff.Excellent.

247
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,130
我需要在半小时后做血液化验 给我准备一下
I'll need someone available to take a blood sample for me in about half an hour.

248
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,920
可以的话
Get me three chairs and an internal phone...

249
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,490
还要三张椅子和内线电话 一杯咖啡 放三颗糖
and coffee,three sugars if you can.

250
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,970
我是医生
The doctor...

251
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,880
刚上任的
is in.

252
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,370
找Dr.Reef的吧 对 他通知过我们了
Dr.Reef.Yes,he phoned to let us know.

253
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,050
- 在第一楼上去 跟着指示牌走就到了 - 好的
- First floor and follow the signs. - Cheers.

254
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,130
这很不正常
This is all rather unorthodox.

255
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,210
应该是给你们寄结果的
Protocol is to send these results in the post.

256
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,080
但既然你坚持要现在就知道结果
But since you insist on knowing now.

257
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,450
那就让我看看
Let's have it.

258
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,050
我们将你的DNA样本跟James Haworth的对比过
We compared the DNA from your sample to that of James Haworth.

259
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,370
结果表明相似度达到99.99%.
The relative chance of paternity is 99.99%.

260
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,250
那James....
So James....

261
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,450
应该可以确认了
It is as beyond doubt as it can be.

262
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,890
是你亲生的Keyes先生
He is your son,Mr.Keyes.

263
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,850
我要再找人确认一下
I want a second opinion.

264
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,320
什么
I'm sorry?

265
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,130
我要有人来再确认一下
I want it reconfirmed.Now.

266
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,250
- 你可以看这报告 - 我就要这样做
- Well,you can see the results. - It's the way I do things.

267
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,250
你去找另外一位医生来
You get another doctor in.Now.

268
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,490
我不知道能不能麻烦其他医生 大家都很忙的
Well,I'm not sure I can just pull a colleague off the corridor.

269
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,770
如果这样做才能让Keyes放心 那你就这样做好了
If it'll put Mr.Keyes' mind at rest,Doctor.

270
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,810
好的
Very well.

271
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,650
你要喝点什么吗
Do you want a cup of something?

272
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,690
好久了 他搞什么啊 有点不对劲
He's been ages.He's made a cock-up.I knew this wasn't right.

273
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,330
对 我想也是
Yeah,think I agree.

274
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,090
那 我们就走了?
What,we're going?

275
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,480
我们呆在这也没办法啊
Well,it's not doing you any good pacing up and down here.

276
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,250
再说 他们寄给你鉴定报告上就会有再次认可的
Besides,they can always send the second opinion in the post.

277
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,120
- 你觉得我们真该就这样走了? - 你决定好了 这是你的问题
- Do you really think we should go? - It's your call.You're in the driving seat.

278
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,440
我是帮人家团聚不是拆散人家的
I'm here to unite people not alienate them.

279
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,450
再等5分钟好了
Five more minutes.

280
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,170
好的
Okay.

281
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,730
这是Mansfield医生
This is Dr.Mansfield.

282
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,050
Mansfield我给你看看这化验报告
Dr.Mansfield,I will show you these two DNA results.

283
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,250
你来看一下

00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,410
花了好几年时间了
Well,it took a few years.

313
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,930
最主要的是
The important thing...

314
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,530
一开始 不要有什么顾虑 怀疑 什么的
at this very early stage is not to worry about any doubts or fears or anything.

315
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,410
大家都要耐心点
Just,you know,be patient.

316
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,530
这地方装修不错啊
It's an amazing place,this.

317
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,650
你想在饮食行业立足 就得花点心思
You got to keep ahead in the restaurant game.

318

客人来吃顿饭 你们厨师就得争的头破血流
Customers will eat the food,but when it comes to other chefs,it's dog eat dog.

319
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,290
这装修花了我们不少钱啊
Cost us everything,this place.

320
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,690
真厉害
It's amazing.

321
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,450
写菜谱有个窍门 就是要简洁一点
Keep the menus brief,that's the trick.

322
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,370
客人都是想人家来告诉他该吃什么的
People want to be told what to eat.

323
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,010
你最拿手做什么菜

That's one of mine,with a spicy fig sauce.

328
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,570
加点伴菜 烤一下
Saffron,roasties.

329
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,570
不要太花俏
You don't want to get too fancy.

330
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,090
如果酱料做的好
Simple food tells its own story...

331
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,290
简简单单也会很好吃
providing it's sauced right.Here.

332
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,560
试试味
Try that.

333
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,060
别装了 我知道你在想什么 Jimmy
Don't dawdle,know your mind,Jimmy.

334
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,570
你想吓走我的客人啊?
Are you taking the piss out of me with this chowder?

335
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,490
你往汤里放什么了?
On second thoughts,have you put the piss in the chowder?

336
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,880
那
So.

337
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,360
你很喜欢做菜 Jimmy
You're mad about your food,Jimmy.

338
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,410
那你手艺行吗?
But have you got what it takes?

339
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,120
没位置了 对不起 先生 但我
No,I am dreadfully sorry,sir.Yeah,but I...

340
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,370
先生 你这样说也没用
Sir,shouting at the maitre d' doesn't alter the fact that there is...

341
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,770
预定星期天中午的桌子要等四个礼拜 再见
a four-week waiting list for Sunday lunch.Goodbye.

342
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,600
对有些人就该这样
Some people.

343
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,610
- 哇 四星期? - 要订星期六晚上的桌子要等8星期呢
- Wow,four weeks? - Eight weeks for a Saturday night.

344
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,090
我们还有一些桌子预留给 一些名人 他们总会很晚才来订位
We always keep a couple of tables on stand-by for those last minute celebs.

345
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,930
你无聊时干什么?
What you doing out here on your Ionesome?

346
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,690
我不无聊 我开了两个公司 还有经营一个社会团体
Two's company,a social worker's a crowd.

347
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,210
我们没被人耍吧 Chris?
We're not being wound up,are we,Chris?

348
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,570
他不是为钱而来的 对吧?以前也有人这样做过
He isn't a gold-digger,is he?Because we've had someone try it on before.

349
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,930
- 不 Jimmy是真的 - 是就最好
- No,Jimmy's for real. - Well,he'd better be.

350
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,050
或者他是有心要骗Johnny的 他所说得又一点不差
Or knowing Johnny,God help him.

351
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,730
你要自己打拼事业 很好
Makes no odds how much you pay for your Chateaubriand...

352
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,370
是金子总要发光的
the bins still stink.

353
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,250
我也希望
Yeah,I suppose so.

354
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,730
这地方我打算用来做个酒窖 在这玻璃幕墙后面
I'm going to put a visible wine cellar out here,behind a glass partition.

355
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,890
很好的一个酒窖
Beautiful thing,a good cellar.

356
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,010
听起来不错
Sounds fantastic...

357
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,210
Keyes.
Mr.Keyes.

358
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,850
叫我Johnny好了
Call me Johnny,at least.

359
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,160
那

360
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,050
你想开一家酒吧
You want to open a gastro-pub.

361
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,410
是有这么打算过
Well,that's the plan.

362
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,410
不过 现在说还早呢
I mean,that's a long way off.

363
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,450
妈死的时候痛苦吗?
So did Mom suffer much before she died?

364
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,930
你妈?
Your mom?

365
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,530
不 她死的很安详 死于炎症
No.It was quick.The cancer was all through her.

366
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,210
我们当时已经分开了 我家人不让我去见她
We were separated by then.The family didn't let me go to the hospital.

367
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,690
我只去了葬礼
Just the funeral.Bastards.

368
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,010
当时我没发火 我没哭
I wasn't angry.I didn't cry.

369
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,570
当你白手兴家的时候 你就学会了尊严 而不是示弱
When you come from nowhere you learn pride.No weakness,yeah?

370
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,930
好了
Look.

371
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,170
明晚 再到这 吃顿饭
Tomorrow night.In here.A family party.

I tell you now,if he could,he'd hand me the whole business on a plate today.

375
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,050
- 我不信 - 你说什么啊
- I don't think so. - What are you talking about?

376
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,890
你们是有血缘关系 但还没到那分上 你得再努力一下 Danny
There's a connection but there's no bond.You need to bond,Danny.

377
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,010
什么?
What?

378
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,050
你不如去吻他一下吧

379
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,520
好的

Eddie's aunt's attic.

381
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,330
Everton赢了FA锦标赛之后就没动过
Hasn't been cleaned since Everton won the FA Cup.

382
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,410
看这蜘蛛网 粘呼呼的
Killer cobwebs.Sticky,with those little bits of grit.

383
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,370
好极了
It's very nice,yeah.

384
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,090
我们要帮帮Danny
We need to beef Danny up.

385
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,080
明晚在K's订一桌
Book a table at K's for tomorrow night.

386
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,610

Nope.

389
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,120
各位
Hey,guys.

390
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,410
大家都想
Guys,you wouldn't be interested in having your picture snapped...

391
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,170
跟Justin Timberlake来张合照吧
with Justin Timberlake,would you?

392
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,650
我听说他在K's吃饭
Yeah,I got the nod he's eating at K's,and the pics always look better...

393
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,530
人多一点才热闹的 去吧
with a little bit of a crowd,you know?Go on.Off you go.

394
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,210
快去 我们爱Justin!快去
Go on quickly.We love Justin!Off you go.Come on.

395
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,930
就在街角那边 快
Just around the corner.Go quickly.

396
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,650
快去
Will you please leave right now!

397
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,610
我不想
I don't want to have....

398
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,330
听我说 我不想报警 快走
Listen to me,I don't want to call the police.Now go!

399
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,050
对不起
Excuse me.

400
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,650
我订桌子的时候不是说了要保密的吗?
When I book a table I ask for discretion to the max.

401
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,090
你以为Timberlake想人知道他要到西区来吃饭啊?
Why do you think Mr.Timberlake is choosing to dine out of the West End?

402
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,050
- 我搞不懂 - 是Justin Timberlake 你这笨蛋
- I don't understand. - Justin Timberlake,you moron.

403
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,570
他没订桌子啊 我可以跟老板娘确认一下
He's not in the book.I can check with Ms.Keyes.

404
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,370
Justin当然没订 他叫人帮他订的
No,Justin doesn't do books.He comes in under the wire.

405
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,890
反正不是叫我订的
Not under my wire,sir.

406
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,280
我告诉你怎么办吧 别准备那桌子
I'll tell you what we'll do,then.Don't get the table ready.

407
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,250
我们就在这等他来
Instead we'll wait in the foyer here with the adoring hordes...

408
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,130
到时你就可以跟他解释了
so you can explain it all to Justin and his people when he arrives.

409
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,330
到时就更不好办了吧
Just doesn't look good for a place like this,does it?

410
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,610
我可以说这跟我们没关系
Well,I can assure you,sir,this publicity leak had nothing to do with us.

411
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,450
到时粉丝都来了 你能怎么办
The hard-core ones pick it up off the fan sites.What can you do?

412
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,000
我会叫Justin的司机晚一个小时到
I'll take the table and tell Justin's driver to delay for an hour.

413
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,690
Justin会谅解的 他是个明白人
Justin's a regular guy.He'll understand.

414
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,170
去准备桌子吧 不要靠窗的 弄得低调一点
Nothing by a window,no place settings facing west.Lead on.

415
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,930
他是谁 怎么占着张四人桌子
Who is he and why has he got a table for four on his own?

416
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,530
好的 好好招待他
All right.Look after him.

417
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,890
但是通知厨房把他名字记在黑名单上
But tell the kitchens to check his face against the wanted list.

418
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,370
- 什么是 黑名单 - 我们厨房有张清单
- What's a "wanted list"? - We have photos in the kitchen...

419
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,210
用来记着评论家跟检查员的名字
so the staff can spot the restaurant critics and the Michelin inspectors.

420
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,530
那他们就会好好照顾那些人了
It helps the monkeys know who the hunters are.

421
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,370
干吗还还不动手你的事业 Jimmy
So why waste your life frying burgers,Jimmy?

422
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,210
还不是时候啊
Well,it's regular bunce,isn't it?You know.

423
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,210
我们得先结婚了再说
We got a wedding to think about,haven't we.

424
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,170
不是吧 你的尊严咧?
Sod that.What about your pride?

425
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,960
这么多水就那么一点柠檬 还有 你的黄油不能软一点吗?

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,970
你是生出来就不会做菜
My God,were you born with such perception or did you learn it from...

446
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,330
－还是你还根本没学好?－你如果有什么不满

"nauseating," "heinous," and "putrid."

452
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,490
你如果不住嘴的话 你可要吃不了兜着走
If you don't shut up,it's not the food that you're gonna be complaining about.

453
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,130

Johnny Keyes付出努力才建起这家餐馆
Johnny Keyes built this place up from nothing.

456
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,330
而像你这样的人就只会贬低人家
People like you only have a talent for pissing on other people's hard work.

496
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,890

I should've lit a candle to him before I took on that cabbie again.

497

那神是个金矿 那你醒目一点 讨好讨好他
The bloke's on hot streak.I told you,stay away or load the deck.

Yeah,perfect son.

501
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,370
你有想过生个孩子吗?
Do you ever wish that you had kids,Ash?

502
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,410
我们这种人肯定要生孩子的
Well,it's the life we sign up for,isn't it?

503
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,240
你呢
What about you?

504
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,890
Mickey跟Danny说话的样子和我以前跟Mickey说话的样子一样
The way Mickey talks to Danny reminds me of the way I used to talk to Mickey.

505
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,850
我知道
Yeah,I know.

506
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,250
当你再没什么可以教后辈了
You know there's a horrible point in your life when you realize...

507
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,650
只有自己去犯一些错
that you've got nothing to teach the younger ones...

508
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,690
让他们从中学习
except through your mistakes.

509
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,010
- 我死了之后 - 别说这些
- But when I die... - No,don't start.

510
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,850
听我说 我死了之后 我要死得富贵
No,when I die,I'm gonna die rich.

511
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,410
我不要人为我歌功颂德
And I don't want any eulogies...

512
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,210
也不要人为我伤心
or tears.

513
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,520
我只想听人家说 "这里葬的是Albert Stroller
I just want people to say,"There lies Albert Stroller.

514
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,810
他钱多到都带不下去

不论什么 你都能从人家手上骗到手

我到死那天都会拼命赚钱的
I'll still be chasing the cons when I fall off my perch.

521
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,250
你赌的太多了
You're gambling too much.

522
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,090
- 别再这样了 - 别说了 让我静一下
- Don't do it to yourself,mate. - Shut up and leave me alone.

Gil是你的好朋友 你当然忘不了他
Gil was your friend and you miss him,I know...

524
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,970
我说让我静一下
I said leave me alone!

525
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,900
可能Keyes...
That's probably Keyes...

526
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,630
在想着
thinking about us...

527
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,870
以为我们在干那事
doing it.

528
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,990
我们不该让他失望喔 对吧
We shouldn't disappoint him then,should we?

529
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,740
他儿子我可是个贫民区出生的小淫虫啊
I mean I am supposed to be a chip off the old block.

530
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,870
Danny.
Danny.

531
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,180
不 我觉得这主意不错
Yeah,I'm thinking that's a very good point.

532
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,180
- 我要来了 - 不要
- I gotta close the deal. - No.

533
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,870
我要来一下
Yeah,I'm gonna close the deal.

534
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,940
Paula 你还要吗
Paula,do you think we should?

535
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,460
你还不够啊
Okay,then,you're insatiable,ain't you?

536
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,820
我就喜欢你这样叫
I love it when you make those noises.

537
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,950
晚安
Night,then.

538
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,830
晚安
Good night.

539
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,950
我想给些钱你们做生意
I want to give you two some money.

540
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,510
这人在试我们啊?
Mr.Bombastic has done it again.

541
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,670
Danny.
Danny.

542
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,630
我如果现在能跟你谈谈
If I could speak to you right now across this table...

543
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,990
- 你会教我怎么做呢? - 听我说
- what would I advise you to do? - Give it a break.

544
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,790
别再跟他玩了
Can we stop playing Jedi master for two minutes?

545
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:00,630
既然他给钱 我要算了
Okay,it's working just dandy andy pandy.He's offering.I should accept.

546
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,390
那她呢?她会怎么想
And what about her?

547
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,190
你要了就惨了
You never wanted his charity,Danny.

548
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,180
因为他知道你是有尊严的 钱你要自己挣回来
No,because you have your pride.You want to make it on your own.

549
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,390
所以你不要要他的钱
And that's why you're going to turn his offer down.

550
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,310
- 我们说好的 Danny. - 那 好吧
- Just like we agreed,Danny. - All right,then.

551
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,140
你为什么不问
Now why don't you ask me...

552
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,220
昨晚的事?
what you're gagging to ask me?

553
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,190
没必要啊 你们昨晚肯定什么都没干
No,I don't have to.I know you two were faking last night.

554
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,660
为什么
Why?

555
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,070
想想就知道了
It's a common mistake.

556
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,630
你们谁都不会有那心情的
But no one has that good a time of it.

557
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,750
我当时做错了决定 就失去了你 我很懊悔
I made a judgment call,and I lost you.It haunts me,Jimmy.

558
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:50,590
我现在给你点钱 都你捏补不了32年来带给你的伤害
I can't make up for the last 32 years but I can help you now.

559
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,620
我把这钱投资在你身上
I want to invest in your future.

560
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,430
亲爱的 我们晚点再谈这 好吗
Darling,don't you think we should talk about this later?

561
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,580
但是我想自己白手兴家
You know I want to make it on my own.

562
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,110
对 Jimmy说的对 我们想自己打拼自己的事业
Yeah,Jimmy's right.We want to carve a life on our own terms.Our way.

563
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,870
那么
What about this,then?

564
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,630
我今晚去你家 尝尝你手艺
I come over to your place and you cook me your piece de resistance.

565
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,900
我的手艺?
Cook for you?

566
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,070
如果你手艺好的话 我就给你钱 作为投资
And if your foods good enough,then I'll invest.

- 你也来吧 - 我约了人
- You'll come won't you,sweetheart? - I've got a pedicure.

我可是很难侍侯的喔
And I'll be tough on you.

569
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,700
你也是知道的
'Cause I know that's what you want.

570
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,070
看 他也想这样
Look at that face.He loves the idea.

571
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,300
明晚5点 我就过去你那
Tomorrow at 5:00.Your place.

572
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,420
我家?
My place?

573
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,300
好的 5点去我家
Great,yeah,my place.

574
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,500
这里光线很好 但你们的人可能会用自己的设备来拍
There's a lot of light.But I expect you guys provide your own.

575
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,340
那电影叫什么?
What's it called again?

576
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,270
Zombie Towers.
Zombie Towers.

577
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,100
讲的是在公寓里面 其实隐藏着通向地狱的门
Block of flats.That's the gateway to Hell.

578
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,950
这地方连拍摄用的手推车都放不进来
Now I don't think there's enough room to run a dolly in here.

579
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,070
我只能用在外面用吊车
Hell,I may just have to ride that bad boy on the crane.

580
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,750
把镜头从外面伸进来
Come up here through the window.Boom.

581
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,460
好了Eaves我们片子的预算很紧
Now Mr.Eaves,we're wrestling a very tight budget.

582
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,830
租一个月也就花你2000
One month's lease is still going to cost you two grand.

583
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,510
我跟你算算帐
Let me crunch you some figures.

584
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,030
就是非林就22万了
The net cost of the picture is 2.2 mil.

585
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,830
美国电影要打入北美市场还要另外给30万
U.S.studio will pick up North American rights for 3 mil.

586
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,110
还有国内跟欧洲市场的宣传费
A consortium will handle domestic and European...

587
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,580
还要付DVD跟有线电视商的钱
and a third party's gonna take care of DVD and cable.

588
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,350
电影还没上画就得付50多万
So we're looking to clear about 5 mil before box office.

589
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,870
你真以为我们开银行啊?
So you would think that we have money to burn.But,alas,no.

590
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,740
当然 如果票房收的好的话又另当别论
The entire budget of this baby is deferred against back-end profit.

591
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,020
2000 没得减了
It's still two grand.Take it or leave it.

592
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,590
好 你够狠的
I like you.You got cojones.

593
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,660
你该给我当助手 我就不用请他了
You should be producing pictures instead of this faggot.

594
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,540
不如你给我们当个配角吧
How would you like to be in one?

595
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,910
你当初跟我说 我还以为你开玩笑
I thought you were kidding when you mentioned it earlier.

596
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,270
你14号 11点来
No.You be here 11 a.m.,on the 14th,and you...

597
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,190
给我们当个配角
are in the movie,Mr.Eaves.

598
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,390
我们送你首映礼的门票
We'll give you tickets to the premiere...

599
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,350
你跟你的朋友就可以在大银幕上看到你
and all your pals can come along and see you up on the big screen...

600
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,900
那可是名扬千古的喔
as one of the undead.

601
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,270
但是 你的房租得等我们票房有收入再说
But,in return you waive the rent until the movie is in profit.

602
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,990
这叫做"权宜之计"
It's called a "satisfactory deferment."

603
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,430
如果电影卖得好
As zombie roles go,it's great.

604
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,190
你可是名扬千里啊
You get to eat Amanda Donohoe.

605
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,260
谢谢
Thank you.

606
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,310
笑一个
Cheese.

607
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,750
你用菠菜把馅包好
So you tie your filo parcels with the spinach strands.

608
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,230
之后呢?
And then you?

609
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,670
把它放在油里炸一下
Then you drop them in oil.

610
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,660
要用滚油 记得要滚油
That's searing hot oil,Danny.Searing hot oil.

611
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,110
- 你知道这对他来说很重要 - 什么
- You know this means a lot to him. - What?

612
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,830
我对他来说是很重要 他以为自己找到了亲生孩子
I mean a lot to him.He thinks he's found his only son.

613
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,580
他是个强盗 他只爱自己 他以前就那样狠的 现在也是一样
He's a bully and he loves himself.

614
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,550
要滚油 滚油
He bounced back once,he'll do it again.Hot oil.

615
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,630
那鸡在哪里
Show me the pheasant.

616
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,950
鸡呢?
Pheasant,come on.

617
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,350
- Danny 鸡要先塞好调料 - 塞好调料
- Danny,that should have infused. - Infuse.

618
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,420
- 鸡要塞好调料 - 好了 还有什么
- Yeah,infuse the pheasant. - Yeah,what's that say?

619
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,500
- 那好了 塞好调料 - 好的 写好了
- I got it,haven't I.Already put infused. - All right,fine.Good.

620
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,820
好的
All right.

621
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,710
要用什么调料
Which sauce do I use?

622
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,660
全都用吧
All of them.

623
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,980
- 不会太多了吧 - 不会 相信我 那会很好吃的
- You don't think that's too much? - No,trust me.It'll do the job perfectly.

624
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,380
记得塞好调料
Remember to infuse the pheasant.

625
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,580
啊 没时间了
Ash,we're getting tight for time.

626
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,030
搞的怎样
How's it coming along?

627
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,230
你不来烦我的话都要搞好了
It'll be a lot quicker if you didn't keep phoning me.All right?

628
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,990
不知道能不能赶上
This is going to be close.

629
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,700
你要去Wilson家开趴啊?
You going to the Wilson's party and all?

630
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,020
不 我去我儿子家 他叫Jimmy.
No.I'm visiting my son,Jimmy.

631
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,100
Jimmy 和Paula那小俩口?在顶楼吧
Jimmy and Paula?Top floor?

632
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,110
- 住得够高的 - 不是啊 是三楼
- Streuth,you'd best get climbing. - Third floor.

633
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,430
Jimmy Haworth?那是地址吗
Jimmy Haworth?Those your directions?

634
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,190
不是三楼 是九楼 他们搬了
Oh yeah,it's not 301,it's 901.That's their old address.

635
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,870
我见过你吗?你声音听起来好熟喔
Don't I know you?Your voice,is familiar.

636
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,630
是吗 常常有人跟我这样说 人人都说我像Michael Caine.
Well,I get that a lot.People say I sound like Michael Caine.

637
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,140
- 是吗 - 对啊
- Do they? - Yeah.

638
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,350
我不等了 我爬楼梯算了
I'm not waiting for this death trap,I'm taking the bloody stairs.

639
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,430
你以前住九楼后来搬到三楼
You used to live in 901 and then you moved to 301.

640
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,460
有个混蛋跟我说你住顶楼
Numb-nut sent me to the top floor.

641
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,270
他肯定搞错了
He's got it the wrong way round.

642
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,310
我们以前是住顶楼 后来搬了
We used to live on the ninth but there was plumbing problems.

643
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,910
- 你好吗Keyes? - 你好
- How are you,Mr.Keyes? - Hello.

644
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,300
还是想陪陪我们啊?
Still feel you can't leave us on our own?

645
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,110
对阿 反正我也没事
No,got no life of me own,mate.

646
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,750
也借此来感谢一下你跟chris
This is our way of saying thank you to Chris as well.

647
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,660
你没必要这样做的
You shouldn't have done all this.

648
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,270
我们还想弄得好一点呢
We wanted it to be perfect.

649
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,820
- 你来了?有好胃口吗 - 这是在哪?
- Hi,I hope you brought an appetite. - Where was this taken?

650
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,820
那是在伊斯特本,不是吗 亲爱的?
That was Eastbourne.Weren't it,love?

651
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,190
当时我们刚订婚
Just after we got engaged.

652
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,790
你没事吧 Johnny?你脸都红了
You alright,Johnny?You're looking a little bit peaky.

653
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,430
要是能吃上顿美味的晚餐就什么事都好了 我们今晚吃什么?
Nothing a good supper won't cure.What are we eating?

654
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,420
好了 首先声明一下
Okay,now you got to bear in mind that...

655
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,980
我只在一家小餐馆做
I am working in the confines of a very small domestic kitchen.

656
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,350
别谦虚
Don't give me that.

657
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,220
来 坐一下 你也不要去偷看别的厨师做菜了
Come on,Johnny,you know better than to go poking round another chef's kitchen.

658
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,380
坐下 来喝一杯
Here,you sit down.I'll get you a nice drink.

659
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,500
你得找个女朋友了
You need to get yourself a girlfriend.

660
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,030
他一在厨房里就兴奋的要命
He's never happier than when he's playing in that kitchen.

661
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,670
油要滚 油要滚
Hot oil.Hot oil.

662
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,860
他就是这样被刺杀的
That's in case he gets a puncture.

663
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,460
快好了
All right for some.

664
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,230
那是什么味道
What's that smell?

665
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,820
我在煮大蒜
It's,well,roasting some garlic.

666
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,900
煮还是在偷吃啊?
Roasting or obliterating?

667
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,910
做的好
Well done,babes.

668
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,700
好了 尝尝
All right,bon appetit.

669
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,710
这灵感来自
Took my inspiration here from...

670
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,420
吉普赛人的做法
the Catalonian gypsy way of cooking the dish.

671
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,620
特意把鸡
Which is to present the bird...

672
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,710
烤焦
as over-basted.

673
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,430
我把这叫做
That's what I like to call...

674
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,950
乞丐鸡
"Peasant Pheasant."

675
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,740
看上去满好吃的
It looks really good.

676
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,350
我来切
Shall I carve?

677
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,020
试试那酱汁
Try the sauce.

678
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,110
觉得怎样
What do you think's in it?

679
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,820
太浓了
Too much.

680
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,740
好了 要来杯白兰地吗
Right,anyone care for a brandy?

681
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,900
我不要
No,I'm fine.

682
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,060
我要点
Well,I'd love one.

683
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,740
我也要点
Why not?

684
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,140
Johnny 你帮我拿一下吧 就在顶架上
I don't suppose you could reach up to the top shelf could you,Johnny?

685
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,180
没有了
This bottle's empty.

686
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,030
我下去买吧
Well I'll just nip over to the offy then,shall I?

687
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,390
很快就回来
Won't take me five minutes.

688
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,030
Chris 你陪她去吧 一个人去不大好
Lovely,sweetheart,would you go with her,Chris?

689
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,390
好的 没事吧?
Yeah,yes.Is anything wrong?

690
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,030
没事 桌子我们来收就好了
We'll clear the table for you.

691
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,660
你的确跟我很像
There's a lot of me in you.

692
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,750
你有梦想 你也有那个模样 你也有尊严
You got the dreams,and you got the patter,and you got the pride.

693
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,510
但你也跟我一样 很爱吹牛皮
And you got the bullshit.I should know.

694
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,710
我想私底下跟你谈谈
I wanted to say this to you in private.

695
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,940
我尊重你 所以我也坦白跟你说
And I'll do you the honor of speaking plainly.

696
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,070
你还厨艺不行
You ain't got it,son.

697
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,110
你有热情 能凑合弄顿晚餐
You're passionate about your food and you can rustle up a meal.

698
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,630
但你还不行
But you ain't got it.

699
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,510
如果我厨房好一点 工具好一点
If I had a proper kitchen.You know,if I had the right gear.

700
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,500
好厨师就算在旅行车上也能做出好饭菜
A good chef can whip up a gourmet meal on a hot car bonnet.

701
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,790
你做的配料比例都不对
You're slapdash about your ingredients.

702
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,540
太多调味了
You throw too many flavors at it.

703
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,830
调味太多而技巧又不够
Too many ingredients and not enough skill.

704
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,430
我要是还借钱给你
Now,I could throw a load of cash at you anyway.

705
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,030
你也是不会要的
But you wouldn't accept it...

706
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,220
因为你还是很有尊严跟原则的
because you got principles and pride.

707
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,910
我很欣赏你这一点
And I respect that more than you'll ever know.

708
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,030
- Johnny. - 跟我来
- Look,Johnny. - Come with me.

709
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,910
等一下 再给他们5分钟
Hang on.Let's just give them a few more minutes.

710
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,540
你在哪弄到这酒的
Where did you get this Madeira?

711
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,150
在哪弄到的 Jimmy?
Where did you get it,Jimmy?

712
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,070
那天我跟他们回家
You know the day I tracked them down...

713
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,590
我还以为那就是我的亲生父母
those people that I thought were my parents...

714
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,190
他们后来却不让我进屋
they wouldn't even let me in the house.

715
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,460
我才知道他们不要我了
That's when I found out that they'd dumped me.

716
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,190
他们给了赎金 却发现
They paid the kidnappers good money for me,only to realize that I was...

717
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,670
我是你的孩子
your boy.That was it.

718
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,740
就不要我了
They didn't want me anymore.

719
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,230
我那天再去到他们那
I came back that night.

720
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,380
当时我很生气
I was so angry.

721
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,020
之后
So...

722
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,710
我把那地方砸了
I just trashed the place.

723
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,870
那你干吗拿了这酒?
Why did you take the bottle?

724
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,990
因为那狮子
Because of the lion.

725
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,660
我记得我床上挂着的狮子
Lions were my first memory.

726
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,060
可能也是因为那样 我才会那么倔强
Guess that's where I get all my pride from.

727
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,230
Samuel?
Samuel?

728
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,150
这是手制的瓶子 年份是20世纪初的 你看那封口就知道
It's a molded bottle.Early 20th century.You can see the seam.

729
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,630
在这背后还写着 "B 1936 HMS."
Here on the back."B 1936 HMS."

730
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,100
是在1936 Boal vintage的 一个叫H.M.Sortiz的人做的
It's a 1936 Boal vintage produced by H.M.Sortiz.

731
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,020
没开封过
No revenue stamp.

732
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,950
我听不懂
I don't get it.

733
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,100
这软木没有用蜡封住
The stopper cork has no wax cover.But that's not surprising...

734
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,550
所以有些发霉了 还长了些虫子
the cork itself has been infested.Maggots got right into it.

735
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,550
里面的酒都沉淀了
The wine itself is lying low shoulder.

736
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,820
当然不能喝了
It's undrinkable.

737
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,820
但是你也不会打算要去喝这酒
But then,you'd never dream of opening this Madeira.

738
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,470
为什么?
Why not?

739
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,070
这酒是在西班牙封瓶的
This particular vintage was transferred to the Spanish mainland...

740
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,670
可能用运它船来命名这酒
and bottled there.Probably given the name of the ship that brought it.

741
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,060
里昂 就是狮子
Leon.The Lion.

742
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,260
这瓶身有些刮花了
But it's the etching here,in the glass itself.

743
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,990
最厉害的是这了
Now that's amazing.

744
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,220
"F.F."
"F.F."

745
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,060
什么意思
So?

746
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,270
这酒 可是用来献给
What you are holding is a Madeira that was presented...

747
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,660
Francisco Franco将军的
to General Francisco Franco.

748
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,220
在1936年十月
On the day he was made commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army...

749
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,190
他被升为将军的时候送给他的
in October,1936.

750
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,340
"F.F."
"F.F."

751
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,790
这东西是你养父母买来做投资的
Those scum you thought were your parents bought this as an investment.

752
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,510
现在它变成你的了
Now,it's your investment.

753
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,550
那家伙有钱不赎他孩子
This bloke's not looking to make money,is he?

754
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,670
非要让人把他孩子带走
He's looking to give it away.

755
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,310
我们给他来了场亲情戏
So we spin him a sob story.

756
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,790
应该还不够吧
But will that be enough?

757
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,550
要让他心肝情愿给钱给我们
Because giving Danny the money has to be his idea.

758
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,270
我想这会比DNA测试更能说服他的
I mean,that should convince him more than any blood test.

759
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,870
让他自愿借钱我投资
So the son persuades him to invest in a restaurant.

760
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,070
就是说我要去学做菜
That will mean that I got to learn to cook...

761
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,830
那可是太难了
which does sound far too much like hard work.

762
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,350
我们要在其他方面骗到他钱
We need him to pay up in cash.

763
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,790
那 这值好几千吧
So,is it worth a few quid?

764
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,150
对啊
Oh,yeah.

765
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,060
我好久没遇过这种好事了
I ain't felt this ruddy good in years.

766
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,190
你跟Paula该要开始一种新的生活了 我也该帮帮你们了
You and Paula deserve a start in life and you deserve something from me.

767
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,460
作为这么多年的补偿
To make up for not being there for you.

768
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,110
你不想我帮你 好没问题
You don't want handouts.Fine.

769
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,260
我就把这酒买了
I'll buy this bottle of wine off you.

770
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,390
120吧?
Call it 120?

771
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,750
- 120块啊? - 120万
- 120 quid? - 120 grand.

772
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,420
别大惊小怪的 这值这个数
It ain't charity,son.It's what it's worth.

773
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,230
要用来拍卖的话我还能赚一笔
I might even make a slim profit at auction one day.

774
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,780
不是吧
Yeah?

775
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,700
你真给我那么多啊?
So you can give me the money fair and square?

776
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:58,780
这是生意嘛
It's business.

777
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,550
120万
A hundred and twenty grand?

778
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,710
我以前也见过你这笑容
I've seen that smile on your face once before.

779
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,540
当时你牵着我的小指头
When you first held my little finger.

780
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,550
我们现在才相认还不太晚
It's not too late for me to be a dad to you,is it?

781
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,100
你跟我啊
You and me,boy.

782
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,950
你跟我
You and me.

783
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,660
都是强者
We're kings.

784
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,830
我们是万物之王
Kings of the ruddy jungle.

785
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,950
没错
Yeah.

786
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,220
来
Come on!

787
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,180
Johnny?
Johnny?

788
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,910
怎么回事
What's wrong?

789
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,940
得骗得过老行家
It has to fool a trained eye.

790
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,270
想个法子把这软木瓶盖搞一下
Find a way of rotting the cork.

791
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,710
弄点虫子放进去
Get maggots into it.

792
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,150
用点腐肉就好了
Rancid meat should do it.

793
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,220
把瓶子弄的好像久经风霜的
Age the bottle.

794
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,150
用它来鱼目混珠
An expert will know if it doesn't feel right.

795
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,870
要弄的像真的一样
Every detail has to be perfect.

796
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,590
- 捡回来 - 不要 算了吧
- Get it. - No.Leave it.

797
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,780
- 别让它毁了 - 算了吧
- Save it. - No.Leave it.

798
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,180
我不想死
I don't want to die.

799
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,260
你不会死的 我叫救护车
You're not gonna die.I'm just gonna call an ambulance.

800
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,580
我 我说过好多谎
I've done....I've been....So many lies.

801
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,710
我说过太多了
I've told so many lies.

802
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,900
你都是被逼的 你也不想的嘛
Look,you did what you had to do,didn't you?

803
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,060
你不会明白的 我当时够钱的
You don't understand.I had the money.

804
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,140
什么?
What?

805
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,190
我够钱付赎金的
I had the ransom to pay the kidnappers.

806
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,500
但是我跟他们说 说我没有
But I kept it.

807
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:53,110
我把钱用来做生意
I called their bluff.It was my money to get started.

808
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,660
我说了谎 之后就失去了你
I took a risk and I lost you.

809
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,230
因为我只想着我的生意
'Cause I wanted the business.

810
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,110
原谅我
Forgive me,son.

811
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,470
我说谎了
I'm a liar...

812
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,700
我骗了你
and a cheat.

813
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,470
原谅我
Forgive me.

814
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,310
我原谅你
I forgive you...

815
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,220
爸
Dad.

816
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,300
这真是精彩极了
It was a work of art,Ash.

817
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,150
你没事吧 Danny?
You all right,Danny?

818
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,340
我知道他是个坏人 还说谎
I know he was a bully and a liar but...

819
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:46,100
但我也骗了他阿
I lied to him,too,didn't I?

820
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,350
他死的时候听到的都不是真话
The last thing he heard before he died was a lie.

821
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,030
我们不仅仅说谎
We don't just lie to people,Danny.

822
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,990
我们说的都是他们想听的
We tell them what they want to hear.

823
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,270
我们还努力的
And for a moment...

824
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,710
把谎话变得想真的一样
they're truly happy.

825
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,110
好了 让我们看一下 可以吧?
So,can we see it,please?

826
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,750
当然可以
Absolutely.

827
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,060
他用尽力气把这拣回来了
He rescued it,you know.With his last ounce of strength.

828
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,590
他自死也是个强人
He was a strong man.

829
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,470
强人还不是死了?
Weak in other ways.

830
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,910
120万
One hundred and twenty grand.

831
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,470
我给你钱是因为Johnny 想这样做
I'm doing this because it's what Johnny wanted.

832
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,350
- 感谢你所做的一切 - 我也有个条件
- Thanks for everything you've done. - Now this is what I want.

833
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,710
你走吧
I want you to leave.

834
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,350
别再来烦我
Live your happy little lives and don't bother me again.

835
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,910
我还要做生意呢
I've got a business to sell off.

836
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,380
你干吗会做两个?
So why did you bother making a back-up?

837
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,470
以防万一嘛
As a back-up.

838
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,310
对不起 Mickey.我知道我一直让你们难做
I'm sorry,Mickey.I know I haven't been easy.

839
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,310
你朋友死了
You lost a friend,Albert.

840
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,500
伤心可以
It's okay to grieve...

841
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,460
但没必要不理我们
but don't shut us out.

842
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,390
Keyes死了也没什么遗憾的
You know,Keyes died well,didn't he?

843
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,060
他以为他儿子原谅他了嘛
Thinking that his son had forgiven him.

844
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,310
可能Gil死的也没什么遗憾的
Maybe old Gil died well,too.

845
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,430
都完成自己的心愿了
Doing what he loved.

846
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,750
我不知道 可能我想太多了
I don't know,maybe I worry too much.

847
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,110
生命是没终点的
There is no destination in life.

848
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,310
过程才是最重要的
The journey is everything.

849
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,140
什么?
What?

850
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,150
你有时候
It's just,the things you come out with sometimes,Albert.

851
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,870
你还蛮给我们鼓励的
You're still an inspiration,you know that?

852
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,790
像老爸一样?
Father figure?

853
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:40,500
我想是像爷爷一样吧 好了 谈一下guru吧
I was thinking more grandfather figure.Okay,what about guru?

854
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,390
guru 好的
Now guru,I like.

855
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,910
没什么好怕的
And there's nothing to be scared of.

856
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,390
我们不是还在一起嘛
We're all in this together.To the end.

857
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,470
你没事吧 我没见到你
You okay,mate?I didn't see you.

858
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,790
没事 扶我一下
Yeah,just need a hand.

859
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,510
捐献点?
For the poor?

860
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,790
好的
Yes.Of course.

861
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,110
你用钱买不了通往天国的路的
My son,you cannot buy your way into the Kingdom of Heaven.

862
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,260
只是表表心意罢了
Just playing the percentages,sweetheart.

863
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,420
到时片子上演了 你就知道我在干吗了
We'll soon see who's laughing when Amanda Donohoe gets here.
