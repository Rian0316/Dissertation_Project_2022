1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,229
If they took all the money they spent
trying to make a decent Hulk movie...

2
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:12,168
...they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,567
That is apt and amusing.

4
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:18,636
I think I shall share that
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

5
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:22,341
- She'll appreciate the witticism.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,747
It will also help improve
her initial impression of you.

7
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:31,420
- So, what's going on with you two?
- Oh, the status is as it always was.

8
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:33,025
She's a girl, she's a friend.

9
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:37,324
She's not my, please forgive me
for doing this, "girlfriend."

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,258
Right, right.

11
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,927
So you're still just texting
and e-mailing?

12
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:45,595
You don't feel any need to hang out with
her, you know, be in the same room?

13
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:48,675
Leonard, you are my best friend.

14
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,504
I've known you for seven years...

15
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:53,772
...and I can barely tolerate
sitting on the couch with you.

16
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:55,710
Uh, imagine my attitude...

17
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:59,319
...regarding prolonged physical proximity
to Amy Farrah Fowler.

18
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:01,719
Got it.

19
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:05,017
- Well, I sense judgment on your part.
- No, no.

20
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,790
Maybe a little.

21
00:01:08,663 --> 00:01:12,064
May I suggest that your criticism
is based on jealousy?

22
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,861
Heh, jealousy? What do I have
to be jealous of?

23
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:18,802
I have a functioning
and satisfying relationship with a female.

24
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,368
And you have none.

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,135
Oh, right. That. Hmm.

26
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:28,510
Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster,
not unlike the Hulk.

27
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:31,652
Who, by the way,
also has a girlfriend.

28
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,810
In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly.

29
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:37,617
Whom you may recall as the girlfriend
of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,886
A feel-good romp
if there ever was one.

31
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,254
I'm not jealous.

32
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,030
Leonard not jealous.

33
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,919
You know, it just occurred to me.

34
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:19,157
If there are an infinite number
of parallel universes...

35
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,995
...in one of them,
there's probably a Sheldon...

36
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,502
...who doesn't believe
parallel universes exist.

37
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,604
- Probably. What's your point?
- No point.

38
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,745
It's just one of the things
that makes one of the me's chuckle.

39
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:39,780
- What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
- Um, recently? Not much.

40
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,979
Is it because of the conflict
that arises...

41
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:44,124
...from your desperate need
to pair bond with a woman...

42
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,817
...and the apparent collective decision
on the part of all womankind...

43
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,462
...to deny you that opportunity?

44
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,625
Um...

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,461
Shut up.

46
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:58,537
You know, when my grandfather
died and Meemaw was alone...

47
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,869
...my Mom arranged for her
to visit a center three times a week...

48
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:05,410
...where she could socialize
with other lonely people.

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,672
It's very nice.

50
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:10,248
They discuss current events,
play bridge, get a hot meal.

51
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:14,479
- That sounds lovely.
- Um, it is if you like bridge.

52
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,286
Do you like bridge, Leonard?

53
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,154
Sheldon, I'm just
not dating someone right now.

54
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:23,297
I don't need to go
to a seniors' center.

55
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:27,998
Meemaw resisted at first,
but now she loves it.

56
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,434
Fine. If I don't meet someone soon,
you can put me in a home.

57
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:35,508
It's not a home.
It's a senior center.

58
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:38,406
We'd never put Meemaw
in a home.

59
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,847
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

60
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,213
All right, I'll bow to social pressure.
Hey.

61
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,519
Excuse me.
That's my girlfriend Bernadette.

62
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,955
I assigned her own ring tone.
"Bernadette" by The Four Tops.

63
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,186
Hello, Bernadette.

64
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,065
When I call him,
his phone plays "Brown Eyed Girl"...

65
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,234
...which now
that I think about it is not so good.

66
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:05,862
You realize
he's just rubbing our noses...

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,905
...in the fact
that he has a girlfriend and we don't.

68
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,542
You mean you don't.

69
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,505
You have a girlfriend?
How could you have a girlfriend?

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,776
- You can't even speak to women.
- Deaf chick.

71
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:21,217
It doesn't matter if I can't talk
because she can't hear me.

72
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,420
- What?
- That's what she said.

73
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,894
Great. You have a girlfriend,
Howard has a girlfriend...

74
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,189
- ...Sheldon's got a...
- Ahem.

75
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,764
- Girl who's a friend.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,901
What about you, Stuart?
You have a girlfriend yet?

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,561
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I met her at Comic-Con.

78
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,606
The one place in the world where saying
"I own a comic book store"...

79
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,573
...is an actual pick-up line.

80
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:47,469
- Oh. Well, good for you.
- Not really. She's horrible.

81
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:52,082
When she wants to have sex, she puts on
her plus-size Wonder Woman costume...

82
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:56,155
...and shouts, "Who wants
to take a ride in my invisible plane?"

83
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,353
- Why don't you just break up with her?
- Heh, no, I can't.

84
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,930
- Why not?
- Because then I'd be alone. Like you.

85
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,537
Dude, why don't you just invoke
your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?

86
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:15,005
Uh, because I don't need his girlfriend
to set me up with one of her girlfriends.

87
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:18,475
I'm perfectly capable
of finding a girl on my own.

88
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:21,979
Oh, Leonard. You remind me
of the funny old story about a man...

89
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,674
...who walks into
a women's correctional institution...

90
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,319
...with a stack of paperwork...

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,182
...that would allow
the female convicts to go free.

92
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:33,656
You're saying I couldn't get laid in a
women's prison with a handful of pardons.

93
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:36,459
Are you gonna
let me tell the story or not?

94
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:44,502
- Leonard? Are you sleeping?
- No.

95
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,435
- Are you ill?
- No.

96
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:50,137
Are you depressed because you're
alone and no one loves you?

97
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,736
I don't know. Maybe.

98
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:56,314
I want you to know that I'm genuinely
concerned about your well-being.

99
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:58,179
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

100
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:01,344
But it's still no reason
to have your feet in my spot.

101
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,522
May I offer an observation?

102
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,323
What the hell?
How long has she been there?

103
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,329
Since we got home
from the comic book store.

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,161
That was two hours ago.

105
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,826
As per your suggestion,
we're hanging out.

106
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,700
Quite frankly, I don't see
what all the hoopla is about.

107
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:20,966
Go on, Amy.

108
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:22,734
From a neurobiological standpoint...

109
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,435
...you may be alone
because your psychological state...

110
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:29,071
...is causing an actual pheromone-based
stink of desperation.

111
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:32,281
- Did you know that, Leonard?
- No.

112
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,078
I did.

113
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,854
I understand that
some people find mates...

114
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,356
...in social gathering places
such as bars or taverns.

115
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,017
Have you tried a bar or tavern?

116
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,288
No, I'm not gonna
pick up a woman in a bar.

117
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,522
Wise decision. You see, Amy...

118
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,032
...success at a bar
is based on classic male attributes...

119
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:52,138
Height, strength, attractiveness...

120
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:56,265
...the ability to hold one's liquor
and throw darts, separately or together.

121
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:59,810
Leonard has none of these attributes,
right, Leonard?

122
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,511
Right.

123
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:07,146
That's not true of all bars.
Juice bars for example.

124
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,221
Oh, good point, Amy.

125
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,017
Yeah. Building on your premise...

126
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,320
...Leonard could frequent sushi bars,
salad bars...

127
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:16,723
...oyster bars,
the Apple Genius Bar.

128
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:19,331
- What are you doing?
- Keep going, I'm listening.

129
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:22,594
That was rude.

130
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,400
He does it all the time.

131
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:28,235
He's a cornucopia
of social awkwardness.

132
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,940
Cornucopia, what a mellifluous word.

133
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,773
- Let's make that our word of the day.
- Agreed.

134
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,848
And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.

135
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:39,084
Well, I have to void my bladder.

136
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:41,187
It was nice
spending this time with you.

137
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:44,791
- Wait. I have a request.
- Yes?

138
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,191
- I'd like you to meet my mother.
- I see. Can I get back to you on that?

139
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:52,764
- Certainly. Good night.
- Good night.

140
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:02,468
Leonard. Leonard...

141
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:06,943
Leonard. Leonard...

142
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:09,674
- Leonard. Leonard.
- Yeah. What?

143
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,580
Amy Farrah Fowler
has asked me to meet her mother.

144
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:16,450
- Yeah? So?
- What does that mean?

145
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,653
You know how you're always saying
that Amy is a girl...

146
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:22,694
...who is a friend and not your girlfriend?
- Uh-huh.

147
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,592
You can't say that anymore.

148
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,659
What?

149
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:31,600
Well, she obviously wants to
take your relationship to the next level.

150
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:35,868
Ugh, I don't want the next level.
I like this level.

151
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,504
Fix it for me.

152
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,079
Me? How am I supposed to fix it?

153
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:44,547
Simple. You want a girlfriend.
Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend.

154
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:47,619
Take her off my hands.
I give you my blessing.

155
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:49,714
That is insane.

156
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,757
You're right. It would never work.
Amy finds you tedious.

157
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:55,362
- Okay, good luck.
- W... Wait.

158
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,826
What am I supposed to do?

159
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,625
Have you considered telling her
how you feel?

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,894
Leonard, I'm a physicist,
not a hippie.

161
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:08,839
All right, well, let me see if I can
explain your situation using physics.

162
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,001
What would you be
if you were attached to another object...

163
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,206
...by an inclined plane
wrapped helically around an axis?

164
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,777
Screwed.

165
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,015
There you go.

166
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:29,191
Amy's right, he is tedious.

167
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,259
Howard, get the door!

168
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,063
Why can't you get it?

169
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,542
You know I'm doing
a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy.

170
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,176
I'm like an upside-down volcano here.

171
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,813
Oh, hey, heh, I hope you didn't hear that.

172
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,890
The volcano thing? No.

173
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:01,486
What's with the T-shirt?
You're working at the Apple store now?

174
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:04,095
Well, uh, no, it's just something
I threw on.

175
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:07,131
I know all your shirts,
that's not one of...

176
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:10,896
You were pretending to work at the Genius
Bar to pick up women, weren't you?

177
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:13,898
Yeah.

178
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:18,745
Turns out they guard the iPods,
but they don't guard the shirts.

179
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,745
- So how'd it go?
- It was going well.

180
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,577
I was showing this super hot girl
how to boot up in safe mode...

181
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,913
...the manager got suspicious and...

182
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:31,922
Well, long story short,
they really do have a little jail in the mall.

183
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,528
Just FYI, don't try to go back
with a fake mustache.

184
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:39,790
I mean, they may not really be geniuses,
but they see right through that.

185
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,928
I wanna invoke the girlfriend pact,
Howard.

186
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,161
You that desperate?

187
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,465
No, uh, I just...
You know, I want what you have.

188
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,301
You know,
I want a woman in my life.

189
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:53,378
Holy Moses,
how much liquid can be in one tuchus?

190
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,683
To be clear, I meant Bernadette,
not your mother.

191
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:01,912
No, I know what you meant.

192
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,461
Well, I'm off to meet
Bernadette's friend. How do I look?

193
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,089
As if one of the plants...

194
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:14,496
...from Invasion of the Body Snatchers
duplicated you in every way...

195
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:17,034
...only with an absurd amount
of hair gel.

196
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,665
What are you working on?

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,809
I'm removing my digital footprint
from the Internet...

198
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:26,434
...so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me
and compel me to meet her mother.

199
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,673
- Oh. You're going off the grid.
- Exactly.

200
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,785
The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.

201
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:37,680
Thank you. I've also sent
Amy a relationship termination notice...

202
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,624
...and changed my cell phone
number and e-mail address.

203
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,353
What if she just comes over?

204
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,022
She'll get lost.
We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles.

205
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:51,297
We now live at 311 Los Robles.

206
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:57,934
You changed the address
on the building? What about mail?

207
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:01,013
No worries, I explained
my predicament to our letter carrier.

208
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,582
He was sympathetic. His exact words
were, "Got your back, Jack.

209
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,981
Bitches be crazy."

210
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,957
- Who is it?
- Amy Farrah Fowler.

211
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,967
- Darn! She found me.
- She's been here before.

212
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,398
The only flaw
in an otherwise perfect plan.

213
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,840
- Now get my back, Jack.
- What do you wanna do?

214
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,604
- Tell her I'm not here.
- Where are you?

215
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,714
I don't know.
You'll have to devise a scenario...

216
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:37,510
...that plausibly explains
my absence...

217
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:42,280
...keeping in mind that the key
to a good lie lies in the details.

218
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:59,068
- Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.
- All right.

219
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,240
Way to go on the details.

220
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:12,784
- Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
- Oh, I take pacts very seriously.

221
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,045
One time at my lab...

222
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:17,281
...a Petri dish of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.

223
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,084
That day, we made a pinky swear...

224
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,820
...never to admit that we crossed
Ebola with the common cold.

225
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,632
Heh. Why the hell would you cross
Ebola with the common cold?

226
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:32,931
We never did.
That would be a terrible, terrible thing.

227
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:36,338
Hi, sorry I'm late.
I was at the gym.

228
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,576
Spin class,
worked up quite a sweat.

229
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,576
Joy, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is Joy.

230
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:47,879
- Hi.
- Hi. You don't look like a genius.

231
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,079
- Go ahead, say something smart.
- Um...

232
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,280
Ehh, time's up.

233
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:55,420
Just kidding. First thing
you need to know about me...

234
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:56,858
...I’m hilarious.

235
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,558
Yeah.

236
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,360
So Bernadette tells me she knows you
from, uh, self-defense classes.

237
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,506
Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.
Lots of fun.

238
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:11,341
Basically, a hundred different ways
to rip a guy's nuts off.

239
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,376
Wouldn't think there'd be that many.

240
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,947
- Number 42.
- Whoa!

241
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,607
Isn't she a pip?

242
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:29,057
Proxima Centauri's the nearest star.

243
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:32,289
The celestial bodies that follow are:

244
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:34,730
Alpha Centauri A, Toli...

245
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:39,501
...Barnard's Star, Wolf 359...

246
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:48,005
...Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B...

247
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:53,346
...BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154...

248
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,647
...Ross 248...

249
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:02,661
...Epsilon Eridani,
Lac 9352, Ross-128...

250
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,558
...Procyon A.

251
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,427
Oh, darn, that's wrong!

252
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,598
EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B...

253
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:19,041
...EZ Aquarii C...

254
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,545
...Procyon A.

255
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,142
Those are the stars
that are nearest to me.

256
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,753
Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

257
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,650
Oh, dear.

258
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,796
They really do be crazy.

259
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,870
This lobster's good on the way down
and the way up.

260
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,742
Should be. It's $30 a pound.

261
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:55,915
Hey. This is a date, right?

262
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:58,912
- Yep, it is.
- Seventy-three!

263
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,110
Oh!

264
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:04,888
Ahem, excuse me, I have to go
to the little girls' room...

265
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,320
...and take a wicked whiz.

266
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,793
I'll go with you.

267
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,896
Fair warning, I had the asparagus.

268
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:13,328
My pee is gonna stink up the place.

269
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:16,828
I think she likes you.

270
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:26,208
EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C...

271
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,338
...Procyon A.

272
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:36,317
Excuse me, madam.

273
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,786
Sheldon?

274
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,525
Rats!

275
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,756
I believe a misunderstanding
may have occurred...

276
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:46,922
...when I asked you
to meet my mother.

277
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,226
No misunderstanding.

278
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,927
I've learned what
that request actually means...

279
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:53,595
...and I don't want
to be joined to another object...

280
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,369
...by an inclined plane
wrapped helically around an axis.

281
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,377
In what way are you screwed?

282
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,149
All I wanna do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother...

283
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,150
...so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.

284
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,721
- So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?
- Precisely.

285
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:14,327
And you haven't fallen
hopelessly in love with me?

286
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:15,961
Don't be absurd.

287
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:20,728
I find the notion of romantic love to be
an unnecessary cultural construct...

288
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:23,028
...that adds no value
to human relationships.

289
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:28,907
Amy, that's the most pragmatic thing
anyone has ever said to me.

290
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,641
I trust this clarification
allows us to return...

291
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:34,576
...to boy-slash-friend-
slash-girl-slash-friend status.

292
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,180
Of course.

293
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,579
Would you like to join me
for Chinese food?

294
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,912
Sheldon, please,
you're suffocating me.

295
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,854
My apologies.

296
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,391
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Sheldon.

297
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:52,094
Come on, just give her a chance.
Maybe she'll grow on you.

298
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,928
Or maybe she'll finally succeed
in ripping my nuts off.

299
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,301
There's still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

300
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,902
Uh, Howard, I appreciate the effort...

301
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:05,510
...but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

302
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,169
Heh, seriously?

303
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,373
I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on JDate...

304
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,849
...and that didn't
even crack my top 10.

305
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,380
Well, I guess the difference is
I have some self-respect.

306
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:19,855
Not that I've ever seen.

307
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,459
It's relatively new.

308
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:25,531
I just know I'm not gonna
spend time with someone I don't like...

309
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:27,132
...simply to have a girlfriend.

310
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,733
I'm okay on my own.

311
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:32,394
Good news,
I made lots of room for dessert.

312
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,066
- Uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but, uh...
- Yeah, you too.

313
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,736
You got anything for next weekend?
I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

314
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,041
- You're asking me out?
- Yeah.

315
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:47,277
And it's an open bar,
so I'll probably be giving it away.

316
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:51,886
I'll look forward to it.

317
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:01,165
It's nice to meet you too, Sheldon.

318
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:05,600
I honestly didn't believe Amy
when she told me she had a boyfriend.

319
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,334
I assure you I am quite real...

320
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:12,308
...and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

321
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:16,138
- What?
- Oh, yes.

322
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:19,217
We are like wild animals in heat.

323
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,445
It's a wonder
neither of us has been hurt.

324
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,515
Amy, what is he saying?

325
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:30,629
You wanted me to have a boyfriend,
mother. Well, here he is.

326
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,800
Have to sign off now.

327
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,198
My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

328
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:42,463
Oh, yes. It's time for me to make love
to your daughter's vagina.

329
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:43,666
Oh!

330
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:51,517
- Thank you. That went very well.
- Agreed.

331
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,448
Amy, I find myself wondering...

332
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,387
...if we should actually engage in coitus
at least one time in our relationship.

333
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,484
