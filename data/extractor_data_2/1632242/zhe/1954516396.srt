1
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,010

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,640
All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,100
trying to make a decent Hulk movie,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,550
they could probably just make an actual Hulk.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,150
That is apt and amusing.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,820
I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,420
She'll appreciate the witticism.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,300
Thank you.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,340
It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,490
So what's going on with you two?

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,320
Well, the status is as it always was.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,000
She's a girl. She's a friend.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,010
She is not my--

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,620
please forgive me for doing this--

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,320
"Girlfriend."

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,580
Right, right.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,970
So you're still just texting and emailing?

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,410
You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know--

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,090
be in the same room?

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,600
Leonard, you are my best friend.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,490
I've known you for seven years,

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,870
and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,050
Imagine my attitude regarding

24
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,710
prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,610
Got it.

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,690
I sense judgment on your part.

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,490
No, no.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,390
Maybe a little.

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,240
May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,960
Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,740
I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female.

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,390
You have none.

33
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,700
Oh, right. That.

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,080
Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster--

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,460
not unlike the Hulk--

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,240
who, by the way, also has a girlfriend.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,650
In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly,

38
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,200
whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,430
in A Beautiful Mind,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,360
a feel-good romp if there ever was one.

41
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,570
I'm not jealous.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,820
Leonard not jealous.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
You know, it just occurred to me,

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
if there are an infinite number of parallel universes,

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,070
in one of them, there's probably a Sheldon

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,080
who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
Probably. What's your point?

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,750
No point.

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,920
It's just one of the things

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,470
that makes one of the mes chuckle.

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
What makes you chuckle, Leonard?

52
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,670
Hmm, recently?

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,880
Not much.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,870
Is it because of the conflict that arises

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,210
from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman,

56
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,640
and the apparent collective decision of all womankind

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,860
to deny you that opportunity?

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,740
Um...

59
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,580
Shut up.

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,010
You know, when my grandfather died,

61
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,800
and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,720
to visit a center three times a week

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,960
where she could socialize with other lonely people.

64
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
It's very nice.

65
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,370
They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.

66
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,960
That sounds lovely.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,890
It is if you like bridge.

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
Do you like bridge, Leonard?

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,260
Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now.

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,760
I don't need to go to a senior center.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,320
Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,330
Fine. If I don't meet someone soon,

73
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,120
you can put me in a home.

74
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,990
It's not a home.

75
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,580
It's a senior center.

76
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,230
We'd never put Meemaw in a home!

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,470
Hey, guys.

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,850
- Hey.  - Hey.

79
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,830
All right, I'll bow to social pressure: Hey!

80
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,460
Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette.

81
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,070
I assigned her her own ringtone--

82
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,080
"Bernadette," By The Four Tops.

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,180
Hello, Bernadette.

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,110
When I call him, his phone plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

85
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,390
Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.

86
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,750
You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,760
that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,550
You mean, you don't.

89
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,460
You have a girlfriend?

90
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,270
How could you have a girlfriend?

91
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,530
You can't even speak to women.

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,500
Two words-- deaf chick.

93
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,210
It doesn't matter if I can't talk,

94
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,170
because she can't hear me.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,730
What?

96
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,520
That's what she said.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend,

98
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,860
- Sheldon's got a girl... - No, no, no, no!

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,990
...who's a friend.

100
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,420
Thank you.

101
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,530
What about you, Stuart?

102
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,880
You have a girlfriend yet?

103
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,980
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,760
I met her at Comic-Con,

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,100
the one place in the world where saying

106
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,430
"I own a comic bookstore"

107
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,580
is an actual pickup line.

108
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,710
Oh. Well, good for you.

109
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,740
Not really. She's horrible.

110
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,650
When she wants to have sex,

111
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,610
she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,580
"Who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?"

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,730
Why don't you just break up with her?

114
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,370
No, no, I can't.

115
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,940
Why not?

116
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,500
'Cause then I'd be alone, like you.

117
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,650
Dude, why don't you just invoke

118
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,410
your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?

119
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,250
Because I don't need his girlfriend

120
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,110
to set me up with one of her girlfriends.

121
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.

122
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,760
Oh, Leonard, you remind me

123
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,450
of the funny old story about a man

124
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,710
who walks into a women's correctional institution

125
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,100
with a stack of paperwork

126
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,690
that will allow the female convicts to go free.

127
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,360
You're saying I couldn't get laid

128
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,260
in a women's prison with a handful of pardons.

129
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,400
Are you going to let me tell the story or not?

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,170
Leonard?

131
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you sleeping?

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,530
No.

133
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,710
Are you ill?

134
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,920
No.

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,820
Are you still depressed

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
because you're alone, and no one loves you?

137
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,450
I don't know. Maybe.

138
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,710
I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned

139
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,330
about your well-being.

140
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,270
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

141
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,450
But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.

142
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,520
May I offer an observation?

143
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,420
What the hell? How long has she been here?

144
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,400
Since we got home from the comic bookstore.

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,170
That was two hours ago.

146
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,570
As per your suggestion,

147
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,710
we're hanging out.

148
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,810
Quite frankly, I don't see

149
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,500
what all the hoopla's about.

150
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,810
Go on, Amy.

151
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,940
From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard,

152
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,680
you may be alone

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,500
because your psychological state is causing

154
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,920
an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.

155
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,580
Did you know that, Leonard?

156
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,760
- No.  - I did.

157
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,320
I understand that some people find mates

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
in social gathering places such as bars or taverns.

159
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,950
Have you tried a bar or tavern?

160
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,200
No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.

161
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,450
Wise decision. You see, Amy,

162
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,110
success at a bar is based on classic male attributes

163
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,240
such as height, strength, attractiveness,

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,950
the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts --

165
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,320
separately or together.

166
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,630
Leonard has none of these attributes,

167
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,210
right, Leonard?

168
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,350
Right.

169
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,770
That's not true of all bars.

170
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,190
Juice bars, for example.

171
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,300
Oh! Good point, Amy.

172
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,050
Yeah, building on your premise,

173
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,470
Leonard could frequent sushi bars,

174
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,390
salad bars, oyster bars,

175
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,630
the Apple Genius Bar...what are you doing?

176
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,420
Keep going. I'm listening.

177
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,030
That was rude.

178
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,510
He does it all the time.

179
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,560
He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.

180
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,730
Cornucopia.

181
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,010
What a mellifluous word.

182
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,910
Let's make that our word of the day.

183
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,910
Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.

184
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,160
Well, I have to void my bladder.

185
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,310
It was nice spending this time with you.

186
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,380
Wait.

187
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,930
I have a request.

188
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,790
Yes?

189
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,590
I'd like you to meet my mother.

190
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,680
I see.

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,290
Can I get back to you on that?

192
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,900
Certainly. Good night.

193
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,640
Good night.

194
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,380
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

195
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,890
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

196
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,550
Leonard, Leonard, leonard,

197
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,200
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

198
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,790
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

199
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,800
Leonard, Leonard,

200
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,860
Leonard, Leonard...

201
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,370
Yeah, what?

202
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,750
Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.

203
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,290
Yeah. So?

204
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,060
What does that mean?

205
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,760
Well, you know how you're always saying

206
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
that Amy is a girl who's your friend,

207
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
and not your girlfriend?

208
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,270
- Uh-huh.  - You can't say that anymore.

209
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,580
Wait. What?

210
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,600
Look, she obviously wants

211
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,980
to take your relationship to the next level.

212
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,490
I don't want the next level.

213
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,400
I like this level.

214
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
Fix it for me!

215
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,490
Me?

216
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,150
Well, how am I supposed to fix it?

217
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,070
Simple! You want a girlfriend,

218
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,610
Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend.

219
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,280
Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.

220
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,650
That is insane.

221
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,760
You're right. It would never work.

222
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,580
Amy finds you tedious.

223
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,370
Okay, good luck.

224
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,750
Wait! What am I supposed to do?

225
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,890
Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?

226
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,380
Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.

227
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,980
All right, well, let me see

228
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,940
if I can explain your situation using physics.

229
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,040
What would you be

230
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,060
if you were attached to another object

231
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,610
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?

232
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,510
Screwed.

233
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,750
There you go.

234
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,000
Amy's right.

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,930
He is tedious.

236
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,890
Howard, get the door!

237
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,180
Why can't you get it?

238
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,100
You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy!

239
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm like an upside-down volcano here.

240
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,150
Oh, hey.

241
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,870
I hope you didn't hear that.

242
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,900
The volcano thing? No.

243
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,110
What's with the T-shirt?

244
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,600
You working at the Apple store now?

245
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
No, it's just something I threw on.

246
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,550
I know all your shirts.

247
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,240
That's not one of them...

248
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,800
You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
to pick up women, weren't you?

250
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah.

251
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,480
Turns out, they guard the iPods,

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,400
but they don't guard the shirts.

253
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,530
So, how'd it go?

254
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,940
It was going well.

255
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,300
I was showing this super hot girl

256
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,620
how to boot up in Safe Mode.

257
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,760
The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short,

258
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,580
they really do have a little jail in the mall.

259
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,630
Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake mustache.

260
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,220
I mean, they may not really be geniuses,

261
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,410
but they see right through that.

262
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,160
You that desperate?

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,510
No, I just... I want what you have.

265
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,440
You know, I want a woman in my life.

266
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,110
Holy Moses,

267
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,140
how much liquid can be in one tokus?

268
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,700
To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
Yeah, I know what you mean.

270
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,370
Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend.

271
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,640
How do I look?

272
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
As if one of the plants

273
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,510
from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way,

274
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,060
only with an absurd amount of hair gel.

275
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,530
What are you working on?

276
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,490
I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet

277
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,620
so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me

278
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,220
and compel me to meet her mother. Ah.

279
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,640
You're going off the grid.

280
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,810
Exactly.

281
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,390
The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.

282
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,390

283
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you.

284
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,730
I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice

285
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,230
and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.

286
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,210
What if she just comes over?

287
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,350
She'll get lost.

288
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,070
We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles.

289
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,640
We now live at 311 Los Robles.

290
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,960
You changed the address on the building?

291
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,910
What about mail?

292
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,910
Oh, no worries-- I explained my predicament

293
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,010
to our letter carrier.

294
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,040
He was sympathetic.

295
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
His exact words were:

296
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,650
"Got your back, Jack.

297
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,800
Bitches be crazy."

298
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,600
Who is it?

299
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,510
Amy Farrah Fowler.

300
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,470
Darn! She found me!

301
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,670
She's been here before.

302
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan.

303
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,710
Now, get my back, Jack.

304
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,590
- What do you want to do? - Tell her I'm not here.

305
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,200
- Okay, where are you? - I don't know.

306
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,710
You'll have to devise a scenario

307
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,460
that plausibly explains my absence,

308
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,070
keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.

309
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,910
Hi, Amy.

310
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,270
Sheldon's not here.

311
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,910
All right.

312
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,590
Way to go on the details.

313
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,480
Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,890
Oh, I take pacts very seriously.

315
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,020
One time at my lab,

316
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,510
a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing.

317
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,630
That day we made a pinky swear never to admit

318
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,280
we crossed Ebola with the common cold.

319
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,960
Why the hell

320
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,240
would you cross Ebola with the common cold?

321
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,620
We never did.

322
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,750
That would be a terrible, terrible thing.

323
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,570
Hi. Sorry I'm late-- I was at the gym.

324
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,820
Spin class-- worked up quite a sweat.

325
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,370
Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.

326
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,700
- Hi. - Hi.

327
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,040
You don't look like a genius.

328
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,190
Go ahead, say something smart.

329
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,300
Uh... Aah! Time's up.

330
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,570
Just kidding.

331
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,310
First thing you need to know about me:

332
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,540
I'm hilarious.

333
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,420
Yeah.

334
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,100
So, Bernadette tells me

335
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,460
she knows you from self-defense classes?

336
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,680
Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.

337
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,860
Lots of fun.

338
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,400
Basically, a hundred different ways

339
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,950
to rip a guy's nuts off.

340
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,370
Wow. Wouldn't think there'd be that many.

341
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,040
Number 42!

342
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,230
Whoa!

343
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,980
Isn't she a pip?

344
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,150
Proxima Centauri's the nearest star.

345
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,390
The celestial bodies that follow are

346
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,140
Alpha Centauri A, Toli,

347
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,510
Barnard's Star,

348
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,710
Wolf 359...

349
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,860
Lalande 21185,

350
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,150
Sirius A, Sirius B,

351
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,040
BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti,

352
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,380
Ross 154...

353
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,020
Ross 248...

354
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,030
Epsilon Eridani,

355
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,080
Lac-9352,

356
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,750
Ross 128,

357
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,700
Procyon A...

358
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,970
Oh, darn, that's wrong!

359
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,590
EZ Aquarii A,

360
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,650
EZ Aquarii B,

361
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,220
EZ Aquarii C,

362
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,870
Procyon A.

363
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,050
Those are the stars that are nearest to me.

364
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,250
Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

365
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh, dear.

366
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,420
They really do be crazy.

367
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,080
This lobster's good on the way down

368
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,790
and the way up.

369
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,120
Should be-- it's $30 a pound.

370
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,810
Hey, this is a date, right?

371
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,390
Yep, it is.

372
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,210
73!

373
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,970
Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room...

374
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,940
and take a wicked whiz.

375
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,610
I'll go with you.

376
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,930
Fair warning-- I had the asparagus.

377
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,620
My pea is gonna stink up the place.

378
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,530
I think she likes you.

379
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,580
EZ Aquarii B...

380
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,070
EZ Aquarii C...

381
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,560
Excuse me, madam.

382
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,470
Sheldon?

383
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,750
Rats!

384
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,440
I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred

385
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,420
when I asked you to meet my mother.

386
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,280
No misunderstanding.

387
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,200
I've learned what that request actually means,

388
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,510
and I don't want to be joined to another object

389
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,440
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.

390
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,360
In what way are you screwed?

391
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,850
All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother

392
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,770
so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.

393
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?

394
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,930
Precisely.

395
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,250
And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?

396
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,090
Don't be absurd.

397
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,820
I find the notion of romantic love

398
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,620
to be an unnecessary cultural construct

399
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,240
that adds no value to human relationships.

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,450
Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing

401
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,720
anyone has ever said to me.

402
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,440
I trust this clarification allows us to return

403
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,760
to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.

404
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,190
Of course.

405
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,630
Would you like to join me for Chinese food?

406
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,950
Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.

407
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,590
My apologies.

408
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,150
- Good night, Amy. - Good night, Sheldon.

409
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
Come on, just give her a chance.

410
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,050
Maybe she'll grow on you.

411
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,150
or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off.

412
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,430
There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet.

413
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,020
Look, H-Howard, I appreciate the effort,

414
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,610
but this is, like, the worst date of my life.

415
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,990
Seriously?

416
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,530
I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date,

417
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,350
and that didn't even crack my top ten.

418
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,370
I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.

419
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,490
Not that I've ever seen.

420
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,800
It's relatively new.

421
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,080
I just know that

422
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like

423
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,380
simply to have a girlfriend.

424
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
I'm okay on my own.

425
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,560
Good news-- I made lots of room for dessert.

426
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,130
Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but...

427
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,810
Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

428
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,070
I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

429
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,320
You're asking me out?

430
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,940
Yeah.

431
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,100
And it's an open bar,

432
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,810
so I'll probably be giving it away.

433
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
I look forward to it.

434
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,180
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

435
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,460
I honestly didn't believe Amy

436
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,070
when she told me she had a boyfriend.

437
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,530
I assure you I'm quite real.

438
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,120
and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter.

439
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,890
What?

440
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,160
Oh, yes.

441
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,050
We're like wild animals in heat.

442
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,330
It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.

443
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,660
Amy... what is he saying?

444
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,330
You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother.

445
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,410
Well, here he is.

446
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,870
Have to sign off now.

447
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,150
My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.

448
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love

449
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,630
to your daughter's vagina.

450
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,780
Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.

451
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,640
Agreed.

452
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,560
Amy, I find myself wondering

453
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,890
if we should actually engage in coitus

454
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,730
at least one time in our relationship.

455
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,210
Bazinga.

456
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,630
Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
