Thank you. Thanks, Cliff.

180
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,040
目前
Uh, right now,

181
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,210
我們正在整個西南地區尋找委托人
we're in the process of mapping out the entire southwest,

182
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,470
優先鎖定幾家最大的磯鷂渡機構
targeting the largest Sandpiper facilities first.

183
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,080
鳳凰城  科泉市  沃思堡  普羅沃
Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Fort Worth, Provo --

184
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,620
這還只是第一步
that's just for starters.

185
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,800
我的理想目標是  月底前再簽下兩百人
Ideally, my goal -- another 200 by the end of the month.

186
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,370
有了這么多人  我們有很大機會
With this many folks, we have an excellent shot

187
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,990
在各區的集體訴訟中
at a solid batch of plaintiffs

188
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,090
積累足夠的原告人數
for the classes in each district.

189
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,070
非常好
Excellent.

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,370
期待你下一次匯報
Look forward to the next report.

191
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,880
接著是更棘手的議題  協調訴訟
On to a stickier wicket -- coordinating actions.

192
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,940
抱歉
I'm sorry.

193
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,290
繼續討論之前
Before we move on,

194
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,980
我想再花點時間談談客戶聯系
I'd like to go back to client outreach just for a moment.

195
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,760
看到這些數據
Looking over these numbers here,

196
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,480
成果真是驚人  吉米
really, astonishing results, Jimmy.

197
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,560
真了不起
Incredible.

198
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,740
你這一趟阿馬里洛之行
Your last trip to Amarillo,

199
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,060
帶回了二十二個新委托人
you came back with 22 new clients.

200
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,830
-是二十四  -二十四
- 24. - 24.

201
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,700
我有點疑惑
I'm confused.

202
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,100
總共有多少人回復了我們的直達信函
Um, how many people out there actually responded to our direct mailer?

203
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,010
一個
One.

204
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,780
是的  好的
Oh. Right. Yeah.

205
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,690
阿爾瑪·梅·厄爾巴諾太太
A Mrs. Alma May Urbano.

206
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,570
但你從一個回復里又搞定了二十四位新委托人
But you got 24 new clients from this one response?

207
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,130
這真是...
That is -- Wow.

208
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,720
過獎了
Well, you're welcome.

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,200
怎么  難道有問題嗎
I mean, what? Is there a problem?

210
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,550
這難免會讓某些人
Well, uh, might not some parties --

211
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,870
比方說  辯護方
the opposing counsel, for example --

212
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,120
發現這差異  因此認為
see this differential and conclude

213
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,370
這其中可能存在教唆之嫌
that there may have been some solicitation involved?

214
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,480
我沒有教唆他們
I did not solicit.

215
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,070
我只想知道你如何解釋你的成功
I'm just wondering how you account for your success.

216
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,980
因為這必定會引起
Because it will definitely raise eyebrows

217
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,680
斯韋卡特和考科利的質疑
over at Schweikart & Cokely.

218
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,490
抱歉但這是事實
I'm sorry, but it will.

219
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,140
特別是牽涉到老年人的案子
Particularly in a case involving seniors,

220
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,240
美國律師協會有關教唆的職業道德規范
for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation

221
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,840
實際上就是為老年人而制定的
were virtually created by the ABA.

222
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,660
查克  我確定...
Chuck, I'm sure that --

223
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,220
吉米  如果你能解釋明白
Jimmy, if you could clear this up,

224
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,210
會大有幫助
that would be helpful.

225
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,840
我去了阿馬里洛探訪一位客戶
I went to Amarillo to confer with a client

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,750
確保我們在當地的案子
and to make sure that we had a solid,

227
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,230
建立在真誠可靠的基礎上
good-faith basis for our case there, overall.

228
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,220
如你們所知
And as many of you are aware,

229
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,370
我拜訪了比計劃多得多的養老院
I've visited more than my share of retirement homes.

230
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,970
他們可是關系緊密的社群
These are close-knit communities.

231
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,690
消息傳播得總是特別快
Let me tell you, word gets around real fast.

232
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,160
住二期的桃樂茜買了輛新的電動車
If Dorothy in Phase Two gets a new Rascal Scooter,

233
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,790
馬上大家就知道了
well, it's big news.

234
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,320
所以其他二十三位老年人主動找到你
So these other 23 residents, they approached you.

235
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,920
克利福德  在我踏進德州前
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt

236
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,910
他們早已聽到了風聲
before I crossed state lines.

237
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,840
我更沒有必要挨家挨戶拜訪
And I certainly didn't have to go knocking on any doors.

238
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,420
他們都很想和一位帶來好消息
And is it any surprise that they want to speak

239
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,290
說他們有錢拿的人談話
with the guy who was there to show them

240
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,300
這有什么好驚訝的嗎
they may have money coming their way?

241
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,280
我得說  這么一想
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind,

242
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,280
我還可以做得更好
I should've done better.

243
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,090
有道理  霍華德
Makes sense. Howard?

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,610
查克
Chuck?

245
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,310
我們能繼續了嗎
We good to move on?

246
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,850
查克這也不是順帶一提
And, Chuck, not incidentally,

247
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,890
這至關重要
it is absolutely vital

248
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,400
我們必須十分謹慎
that we dot our I's and cross our T's here.

249
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:50,430


250
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,560
謝謝你寶貴的意見
Invaluable. So, thank you.

251
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,570
完美的代價乃永恒的警惕
The price of excellence is eternal vigilance.

252
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,480
沒錯
Indeed.

253
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,940
協調
Coordination.

254
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,630
我們剛剛是談到這里吧
I believe that's where we left off.

255
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,240
沒錯
That's right.

256
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,810
布萊恩  你負責這個  你來說吧
Brian, this is your thing, so why don't you take this?

257
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,060
好吧
Sure.

258
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,170
考慮到這些案子所涉及的方面
Considering the dimensions of these cases,

259
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,790
進行具體分析和綜合考量后
taken together and individually,

260
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,640
應該指定專人進行規劃安排
it makes sense to designate someone to handle the scheduling.

261
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,040
我建議在戴維斯梅因成立一個小組
What I'm proposing is that we create a small team at D&M

262
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,680
專門負責協調單個訴訟及其之間的
dedicated specifically to coordinating all elements

263
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,060
所有因素
of the individual actions.

264
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,530
我們凡事都會告知哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
We'll loop in HHM on anything --

265
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,010
布萊恩  抱歉
Uh, Brian, I'm sorry.

266
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,160
抱歉打斷你一下
Excuse me for interrupting.

267
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,730
我只是想說我同意查克的觀點
Uh, I just want to say that I take Chuck's point.

268
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,680
真的
I do.

269
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,820
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}意即不能接受別人的懷疑

270
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,820
就像凱撒之妻一樣
I mean, this is, like, a wife-of-Caesar type of thing.

271
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,920
連教唆的意思都不能有
There can't even be a hint of solicitation.

272
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,760
所以我準備不這么辦了
So I'm gonna pull back.

273
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,690
好吧  不到磯鷂渡搞什么見面會了
All right, no more meet-and-greets at the Sandpiper facilities.

274
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,980
我會另想辦法的
I'll find another way to proceed.

275
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,430
吉米  這我們就交給你了
Well, Jimmy, we'll leave that up to you.

276
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,120
聯系客戶是你負責的事
You know, client outreach is your department.

277
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,440
說到哪兒了來著
Uh, where was I?

278
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,830
對
Okay, right.

279
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,780
如果我們能在新墨西哥有更穩固的指揮中心
If we have a more consolidated nerve center here in New Mexico,

280
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,710
就能...
where the...

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,110
金  我該上哪兒搞尼德曼的供詞
Hey, Kim, uh, where can I get a copy of that Neiderman deposition?

282
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,070
我有一份多的  吉米
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.

283
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,460
給你一份吧
You can have one of mine.

284
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,370
謝了  艾琳
Oh, wow. Thanks, Erin.

285
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,340
不客氣
Yeah, no worries.

286
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,150
該死  我放哪兒了
Shoot. Where'd I put that?

287
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,270
謝了...
Thanks, that's...

288
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,360
查克真是令人難以置信
Man, do you believe Chuck in there?

289
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,440
天啊  還教唆
Jesus. Solicitation?

290
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,230
我告訴你  我們當初拼命立案的時候
Let me tell you, when we were building this case,

291
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,860
我可是追在逛商場的八十歲老頭后面
I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.

292
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,790
這才叫教唆
That was solicitation.

293
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,280
但他有說我什么嗎
But did he say "Boo"?

294
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,580
當然沒有
Bullshit he did.

295
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,290
在德州發生了什么
What happened in Texas?

296
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,370
沒什么
Nothing.

297
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,280
我做了我該做的
I did my job.

298
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,820
你沒有在休息室里給那些老家伙載歌載舞嗎
You didn't do a song and dance in the dayroom for the old-timers?

299
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,020
沒有  沒有
No. No.

300
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,070
沒...沒在休息室里
Not -- not in the dayroom.

301
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,540
吉米  你知道教唆他人會讓你被取消律師資格的
Jimmy, you know solicitation can get you disbarred.

302
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,980
這很重要
This matters.

303
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,630
我認為最重要的是
Well, here's what I think matters --

304
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,460
現在二十四名老年人有自己的代表了
24 senior citizens now have representation.

305
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,200
我去之前
Before I went,

306
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,110
他們根本不知道自己被剝削了
they didn't even know they were getting ripped off.

307
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,670
現在他們有我們撐腰
Now they have us in their corner.

308
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
這怎么能不算一種勝利呢
How is that not a win?

309
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,310
你剛剛說你會另想辦法
You said in there you'd find another way.

310
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,110
你是認真的嗎
Did you mean it?

311
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,910
當然了  絕對的  我...
Sure. Absolutely. I --

312
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,340
聽著  我...
Look, I...

313
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,870
我要告訴你一件非常重要的事
I need you to understand something very critical here.

314
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,420
說吧
Shoot.

315
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,290
為了給你弄到這份工作  我拿我的飯碗作擔保
I put myself on the line to get you this job.

316
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,720
好吧
Uh, okay.

317
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,820
我還以為是因為我擅長與老人打交道呢
I thought it was 'cause I'm sensational with old people.

318
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,860
那你以為是誰告訴他們的
Yeah, and who do you think told them that?

319
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,200
所以呢...這算是你幫了我嗎
So, what -- you threw me a bone?

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,530
不...混蛋
No...asshole.

321
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,030
你知道我相信你
You know I believe in you.

322
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,050
后來我也說服他們相信你
But then I made my beliefs known to them.

323
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,810
現在你做的一切在霍華德看來就代表著我
And now everything you do reflects back on me with Howard,

324
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,200
因為說到底  是我說服他
'cause ultimately, I talked him into

325
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,800
冒險讓你試一試
going out on a limb for you, too.

326
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,410
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

327
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,250
是...是我的承諾  是我的判斷
It's -- it's -- it's my word, it's my judgment.

328
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,320
明白
Yeah.

329
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,080
你我都知道你能勝任這份工作
You and I both know you can do this job.

330
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,740
但拜托你用正確的方式
But please, you just have to do it right.

331
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,690
你得確保
Well... you want to make sure

332
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,320
電池的方向正確  不然沒有用
you put in the batteries the right way or he won't work.

333
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,400
然后合上蓋子
Then you close them up.

334
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,070
然后...
And...

335
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,810
我覺得...我覺得這樣就行了  小姑娘
I think -- I think you're good to go, young lady.

336
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,480
你捏一下它的腳試試
Why don't you give his foot a squeeze?

337
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,910
它真好笑
He's funny!

338
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,040
親愛的
Oh, darlin'.

339
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,000
我就叫你...哼哼先生吧
I think I'll name you... Mr. Snuggles.

340
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,310
你餓了嗎
Are you hungry?

341
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,510
我去給你拿點土豆泥
I'm gonna get you some mashed potatoes.

342
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,420
這些錢應該夠你撐過下個月了
That should get you through to next month.

343
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,140
麥克  謝謝
Mike, thank you.

344
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,540
但你其實沒必要...
But you shouldn't feel that you need to --

345
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,590
太遲了
Too late.

346
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,980
出什么事了
Something up?

347
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,680
感覺好像有什么事
Feels like something's up.

348
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,910
不  只是...
No, it's...

349
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,880
我睡得不夠
I didn't get much sleep.

350
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,060
-我的頭...  -抱歉
- My head's... - I'm sorry.

351
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,910
跟我說這不關我的事  那我就不管了
You tell me it's none of my business, I'll drop it.

352
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
我不想讓你擔心
I don't want you to worry.

353
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,920
我也不喜歡擔心
Not the worrying kind.

354
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,710
前兩晚  我聽到了槍聲
Last two nights, I heard gunshots.

355
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,710
第一晚  可能在一兩個街區外
First night, they were maybe a block or two over

356
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,870
我驚醒了
and woke me up.

357
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,770
我第一反應是鞭炮聲
My first thought was firecrackers,

358
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,310
我當時這么認為的
and that's what I assumed at the time,

359
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,180
但是昨晚  我絕對沒聽錯
but then last night -- there's no mistaking it.

360
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,010
一共三聲
There was three of them.

361
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,280
很快  "啪啪啪"三聲  更近了
They were quick -- pop, pop, pop -- closer.

362
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,270
好像...
It was...

363
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
他們就在房子外面
like they were right outside the house.

364
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,170
你報警了嗎
You call the cops?

365
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,070
報了
Yeah.

366
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,760
警察一小時后才過來
Took them over an hour to get here,

367
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,700
在周圍看了整整兩分鐘
then they looked around for a whole two minutes,

368
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,190
當然沒什么發現
but by then, of course, there was nothing to see.

369
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,380
我今晚待這兒
I'm staying here tonight.

370
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,590
不用  麥克
No, Mike, no.

371
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,760
-沒這個必要  -我沒問題
- That's not necessary. - No, it is not a problem.

372
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,970
我睡沙發
I'll take the couch.

373
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,340
麥克  你問了我才回答
Mike, you asked, so...I answered.

374
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,560
別讓我后悔告訴你
Please don't make me sorry I told you.

375
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,800
凱莉  過來
Kaylee, come, hmm?

376
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,550
吃晚飯
Get your supper.

377
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,250
那科泉市呢
What about Colorado Springs?

378
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,040
283個居住者  發了283封信函
283 residents, and we sent out 283 mailers.

379
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,510
行  那有多少回函呢
Yeah, and how many response cards came back?

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,270
零
Zero.

381
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,720
零嗎
Zero?

382
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,080
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

383
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,760
達納  托尼  再見
Dana, Toni, have a good one.

384
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,200
再見  梅因先生
Bye, Mr. Main.

385
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,490
再見  梅因先生
You, too, Mr. Main.

386
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,230
克利福德  能談會兒嗎
Cliff, uh, could I have a second?

387
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,530
怎么了
What's up?

388
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,430
是寄給磯鷂渡信函的事
Uh, yeah, it's the Sandpiper mailers.

389
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,310
我們應該有約百分之十二到十五的回信
Yeah, we should be getting responses of like 12 to 15 percent,

390
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,800
但只有一兩個點
but we're getting ones and twos.

391
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,630
科泉市甚至為零
In Colorado Springs, zero.

392
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,320
怎么會這樣
Wow. How can that be?

393
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,410
他們員工搞的鬼吧
I'm thinking it's the staff.

394
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,700
信封交給居住者前就被員工扔了吧
They're tossing the mailers before they can reach the residents.

395
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,080
可能是他們上級要他們這么做的
Maybe they got told to do it by the Sandpiper front office,

396
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,050
真可以以這個起訴他們
which would be actionable as hell.

397
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,650
前提是我們能證明  但很難做到
If we could prove it. Big "if."

398
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,140
我需要更多人力才做得到
And to do so would take more manpower than I can spare.

399
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,620
我們現在先繼續爭取更多委托人
For now, let's just stick with getting those client numbers up.

400
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,370
你最好另尋他法
Guess you better think of another way.

401
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,710
已經想好了
I think I got it.

402
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,000
電視廣告  更具針對性
TV commercial. Highly targeted.

403
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,080
告訴你  在磯鷂渡里一切都很準時
Let me tell you, at Sandpiper, the trains run on time.

下午三點到四點都是自由活動
They always leave 3:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M. free.

411
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,670
為什么  因為要看《女作家與謀殺案》[美劇]
Why? "Murder, She Wrote."

412
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,620
這劇長盛不衰
It's been in syndication since like the 1850s,

413
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,800
跟你說  只要電視里一開始演
and let me tell you, when that thing comes on,

414
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,420
那些老年人就像飛蛾撲捕蟲燈一樣
it draws the blue-hairs like moths to a bug zapper.

415
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,900
下午三點十四  第一段以懸念結束后

保證賺足眼球
Guaranteed eyeballs -- lots of 'em.

418
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,200
磯鷂渡對此無能為力
There's nothing Sandpiper can do about that.

419
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,340
我們幾年前做過一個廣告
We ran a commercial a few years back --

420
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,090
也是起集體訴訟案
another class-action case.

421
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,020
對我們算是新鮮事
Kind of a new thing for us.

422
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,630
我不習慣這么做
Now, it's not exactly my go-to,

423
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,750
但我持開放態度
but generally speaking, I'm open to it.

424
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,560
我們下周再談
We will talk next week.

425
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,140

而今晚  我們就要跟隨他們的腳步
and tonight, we join them.

484
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,550
這讓人興奮  對吧
This is heady stuff, right?

485
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,030
那么  聽好了
Okay. So, pay attention.

486
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,730
畫面從老奶奶開始  她坐在搖椅上搖
We open on granny, and she is rocking.

487
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,920
就這樣來回地搖
So she's back and forth,

488
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,450
慢慢地搖啊搖
just very back...and forth.

489
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,990
然后  非常緩慢且平穩地
And then, very slowly and smoothly,

490
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,580
攝影機移向她的...
the camera, uh... moves towards her...

491
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,280
-移動攝影車嗎  -移動攝影車  沒錯
- Dolly? - A dolly -- good.

492
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,490
你看這有移動攝影車嗎
See a dolly here?

493
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,190
你們沒帶移動攝影車來
You guys didn't bring a dolly?

494
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,450
沒有
Nope, no dolly.

495
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,490
你沒說要帶移動攝影車來
You didn't ask for a dolly.

496
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,790
-得提前說  攝影車要額外收費  -是的
- Gotta ask, dude. Dolly's extra. - It's true.

497
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,680
好吧  那就沒有吧
Okay, no dolly.

498
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,100
那我們就即興發揮一下
We will improvise, then.

499
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,490
順著我的思路
Stay with me.

500
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,750
她搖晃著
She's rocking.

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,310
打著寒戰
She's shivering.

502
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,310
緊緊抓著一個破舊的披肩
She's clutching at a tattered shawl.

503
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,280
那些混蛋把她的暖氣停掉了
They turned the heat off on her, these evil bastards.

504
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,720
她又冷又餓  孤單一人
She's cold and hungry, she's friendless.

505
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,110
真是一幅令人心痛的畫面
This is heart-rending stuff, man.

506
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,790
一個長鏡頭  背景用黑白色調
Okay, it's a oner, and it's shot in glorious black and white.

507
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,350
這個可以做到吧
We can do that, right?

508
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,430
可以
Yeah.

509
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,180
就這樣而已嗎
So that's it?

510
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,950
老太太坐在椅子上
Old lady in a chair?

511
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,170
這就是你的廣告
That's your commercial?

512
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,100
你這副樣子有人喜歡嗎
Does anybody like you?

513
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,460
我準備好拍特寫了  麥吉爾先生
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. McGill.

514
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,220
一記高飛球  稍偏離正中
...And an easy, easy pop fly off dead center.

515
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,740
墨菲在之前的八場比賽中29擊13中

安打率為0.343  非常棒
batting a blistering 343 overall,

517
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,190
劉易斯現在又在跟教練商量
and now Lewis again working quickly with the bench.

518

墨菲投球  球觸地兩次進入人群
Murphy swings, it's a two-hopper into the crowd.

519
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,060
界外球
Foul ball.

520
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,260
祝你今天愉快
Have a good one.

521
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,600
出什么事了
Hey, honey. What's happening?

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,600
怎么了
What's wrong?

523

你還好吧
Are you all right?

527
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,330
我帶你去看看
Let me show you.

528
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,580
那上面
It's up -- it's up there.

529
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,670
你看到了嗎
You see it?

530
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,580
就在那上面
It's right up there.

531
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,270
看到了嗎  你看到它的形狀了嗎
You see that? You see the shape of it?

532
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,500
你看到了吧
You do see it, right?

533
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,800
看到了
I-I see it.

534
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,710
你什么時候聽到的槍聲
What time did you hear the shots?

跟上次一模一樣
It was exactly like last time.

538
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,070
你也沒有報警  報了嗎
And you didn't call the police. Or did you?

539
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,150
沒有  報警有什么用
No, I... What's the point?

540
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
我在想有沒有其他的可能...
I'm thinking outside the box, but...

541
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,520
有沒有可能是你做夢夢到的
you think maybe it's possible that you dreamed it?

542
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,890
有時會發生這種情況
It happens sometimes.

543
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,050
我沒有做夢  麥克
I didn't dream it, Mike.

544

因為我昨晚一夜沒合眼
Because I didn't sleep a wink last night.

545

這就是子彈的痕跡  肯定是

昨晚之前還沒有
It wasn't there before last night.

547

我跟你保證  我不知道...
I promise you that, and I don't know --

548

你對這些東西不好奇嗎
You ever wonder about these things?

558

什么東西
What things?

559
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,440
這個  為什么會有這些東西
This. Like, what's the story with these?

560
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,770
是誰第一個說
Who was it who first said,

561
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,890
"我知道了  就放一大碗球吧"
"Hey, I know -- big bowl of balls."

562
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,210
我不知道
I don't know.

563
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,800
房子自帶的
They came with the place.

564
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,980
要你說
No shit.

565

世界上每間公司臨租房里都有這東西
They're in every corporate apartment in the world.

566
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,800
就像基甸國際贈送的《圣經》

567
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,120
好啦  不要嫉妒我的一大碗球了
Hey, don't be jealous of my big bowl of balls.

568
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,350
別丟人了
It's unbecoming.

569
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,730
為什么一定要擺空花瓶呢
Why do they all have to have empty vases?

570
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,730
法律規定的  這是比喻的說法
Well, it's the law. Plus, it's a metaphor.

571
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,400
我必須得說
I got to say,

572
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,680
我會想念美甲店的振動按摩椅的
I will miss the Nail Salon's vibrating chairs.

卡伯特灣又發生了一樁謀殺案嗎
There's been another murder in Cabot Cove?

585
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,640
不會吧
No!

586
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,730
沒錯  警長無能為力
Yes. The sheriff is in over his head,

587
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,460
杰西卡·弗萊徹不得不再次
and once again, Jessica Fletcher has to put aside the novel

588
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,000
把她在寫的小說放一邊來協助執法
she's been writing and assist law enforcement.

589
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,820
令人震驚的是
Shocker!

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,940
兇手留下一封密文  然后進廣告
The killer left behind a cryptogram -- and commercial.

他們說會照顧好一切

怎么會這樣
How could that be?

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,190
錢都去哪兒了
Where did it all go?

601
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,300
她裝哭的是吧
That's not a real tear, is it?

602
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,160
-如果你或是愛人...  -是眼藥水

是嗎
Yeah?

718
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,700
不過你這么挑剔  估計又不肯接吧
It's probably a long shot, given your selectivity.

719
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,660
什么活
What's the job?

720
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,570
我問了  那人不肯說
I asked. Guy wouldn't tell me.

指名要你
he specifically asked for you.

724

那人是誰
And who's the guy?

725
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,950

他先拍的這個還是《麥克米蘭夫婦》

別說話  好好看
Shut up. Watch the movie.

735
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,060
你怎么會有這么奇怪的愛好
What is this weird fascination you have

736
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,920
喜歡看人被困在北極
with stories of men trapped on the North Pole?

737
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,010
《大北極》的設定在北極
"Ice Station Zebra" is on the North Pole.

738
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,350
《怪形》發生在南極
"The Thing" takes place on the South Pole.

739
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,370
這兩個天差地別
They literally could not be any more different.

740
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,480
我爸特喜歡這個

742
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,210
是啊
I know, right?

743
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,500
都對這片子贊不絕口
Can't get two finer reviews than that.

744
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,920
空氣瓶組內還剩多少壓力
How much pressure's left in the air banks?

745
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,590
不足八百磅  長官
Down 800 pounds, sir.

746
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,870
是老板
It's the boss.

747
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,960
這時候打電話來
At this hour?

748
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,150
是啊
Yeah.

749
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,950
祝賀嘛  多晚都不嫌遲
It's never too late for congratulations.

750
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,710
克利福徳  天哪  這個點了你還在辦公室
Cliff, Jesus, you're still at the office?

751
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,300
你播了一支廣告
You ran a commercial?

752
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,180
是啊  天哪
Yeah, and, oh, my God,

753
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,100
我跟你說  那反響簡直
let me tell you, the response has been --

754
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,510
你拍了一個廣告  沒給我過目就播出去了
You ran a commercial without ever showing it to me,

755
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,290
也沒有事先征求我和合伙人的意見
without first consulting me and my partners.

756
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,510
你真以為我會同意嗎
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?!

757
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,290
我打算明天早上告訴你的
I was planning on telling you in the morning.

758
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,380
廣告播出一天之后才告訴我
The day after it aired?!

759
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,870
只播出了一次  只面向很小一部分觀眾
I only ran it once, just in one small market.

760
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,730
只是個試驗而已  好吧
It was kind of an experiment, all right?

761
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,930
沒什么人注意
Kind of under the radar.

762
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,710
而且公平地講
And in all fairness,

763
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,470
你說過的  客戶聯系這塊歸我管
you did tell me client outreach was my department.

764
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,740
不要狡辯了
Don't be disingenuous.

765
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,490
這個廣告提到我的公司名了吧
This commercial -- I take it my firm's name is mentioned?

766
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,850
是的  提到了
Yes. Yeah.

767
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,840
天哪
Jesus...

768
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,710
霍華德說你有些古怪
Howard said you were a little eccentric.

769
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,250
他可沒說你這么能惹事兒
He didn't tell me you were a goddamn arsonist!

770
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,320
克利福德  說真的  我不認為
Cliff, to be fair, I don't think, uh...

771
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,230
如果是我誤解了你的話
I apologize if there was any misreading

772
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,060
我道歉
of the situation on my part,

773
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,140
但是現在形勢大好
but there's a very positive headline here.

774
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,300
我們今天接到了103個電話
We got 103 phone calls today,

775
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,620
區區七百塊廣告費就有這么好的效果
off a measly $700 ad buy.

776
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,880
這種投資回報率可不是你...
Now that kind of return on investment you can't g--
