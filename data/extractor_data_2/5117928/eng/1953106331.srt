1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:03,335
The Big Bang Theory -
it's a funny show.

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,135
Who's Adam West?

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:07,455
Who's Adam West?

4
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:10,575
What do you two talk about?

5
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:13,535
We're going to relive some of the
show's most memorable moments.

6
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:14,895
What's going on?

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:17,895
It's not what it looks like.

8
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:21,895
Oh, it's a tiara!

9
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,335
I love you so.

10
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:24,695
I love you too.

11
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,455
Jim, hello.
And, how are you?

12
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:30,015
I'm here on set with the cast to get
them to tell us their favourites.

13
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:32,495
I'm kind of a fan girl
about this show.

14
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,975
And, let us in on a few secrets.

15
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,495
I'm not a big Star Trek fan, so...

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,455
Are you excited?

17
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,735
I'm really excited.
I'm a fan of the show.

18
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:44,015
Welcome to The Big Bang Theory,
it all started with a big bang.

19
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,695
Boom!

20
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:09,735
This is the opportunity of a
lifetime for a Big Bang Theory fan.

21
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,655
Full access behind the scenes.

22
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,095
And a chance to talk to the cast
and crew to ask them the questions

23
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:21,095
that we fans, by which I mean me,
are dying to know the answers to.

24
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:24,415
Here we go and background, action!

25
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,895
Leonard, promise me,
when our new waitress comes over,

26
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:29,855
you will not start a complicated
on-again, off-again relationship

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,855
with her because
I'm very, very hungry.

28
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,695
It's such a simple idea.

29
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:42,375
Too geeky guys get a hot neighbour.

30
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:44,375
Guess, I'm your new neighbour, Penny.

31
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,615
Leonard, Sheldon.

32
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:46,175
Hi.

33
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,335
- Hi.
- Hi.

34
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:51,335
And yet that simple idea
has created a comedy supernova,

35
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,175
one of the biggest
shows in the world.

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,175
Wow, you really are a genius.

37
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:02,495
Not really,
I Googled how to do that.

38
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,615
The show has some truly
legendary characters.

39
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:09,615
In our rag tag band of scientists,
with nothing to lose,

40
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:10,815
I am the smart one.

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,735
Wolowitz is the funny one
and Koothrappali

42
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:15,215
is the lovable foreigner
who struggles to understand

43
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:18,175
our ways, and fails.

44
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:21,535
Now, we all know these geeks
and girls so well after five years

45
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,935
that they hardly need
any introduction.

46
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,415
What do the cast think of them?

47
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,415
How would you describe
Leonard as a character?

48
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,455
Struggling.

49
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:35,175
One Tequila Sunrise.

50
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,255
Thank you.

51
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,335
This drink is a wonderful example
of how liquids with different

52
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:43,335
specific gravities interact
in a cylindrical container.

53
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:45,855
Thank you.

54
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:49,055
That's what's fun
about playing him,

55
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,975
he's struggling to evolve.

56
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,615
You have assured my ability
to tolerate idiots.

57
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,895
Now, come with me.

58
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,055
Where are we going?

59
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,495
We are going to have sex.

60
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,335
Why? I mean, OK.

61
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:04,735
Sheldon's first and
foremost a genius.

62
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,255
Are you familiar with mean theory?

63
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:08,855
I'm familiar with everything
but go on.

64
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,855
He is doing his best to stick
to his guns of what he wants,

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,815
while having small moments
of learning

66
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:19,815
how to be a more normal human
being, for lack of a better word.

67
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:25,295
What kind of doctor removes
shoes from asses?

68
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,175
Depending on the depth,

69
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:31,175
that's either proctologist
or a general surgeon.

70
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,175
How would you describe Penny?

71
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,655
Adorable.

72
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:40,375
Mm-hm.

73
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:43,095
Look, guys, for the future
I don't mind killing the big spiders

74
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:45,815
but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

75
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:49,815
I love that she has become
so sarcastic and funny.

76
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:53,135
The last morsel
is called the greng jai piece

77
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:56,335
and it is reserved
for the most important

78
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,335
and valued member of the group.

79
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,735
Thank you all for this high honour.

80
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:09,135
How would you describe Howard?

81
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,095
I would say a bit

82
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:14,455
of a delusional Casanova.

83
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:15,935
May I say, Penny,

84
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,935
not a lot of women could look as hot
as you do with such greasy hair.

85
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:28,255
More confidence
than is good for him.

86
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,855
Or, maybe ignorance is bliss,
I don't know.

87
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,975
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticised human cadavers.

88
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:37,055
And some of those skinless
chicks were hot.

89
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:40,615
Raj is like the Tom Cruise
of the sitcom world.

90
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,095
He is, he is. It's the looks.

91
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,295
It's the...

92
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:48,295
You know, erm, Raj
is the foreigner on the show.

93
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,655
He comes from
India, New Delhi, India.

94
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:55,655
What, just because I'm Indian
I can't be a Norse god?

95
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,655
No, no, no,
Raj has to be an Indian God.

96
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,855
He's obviously pathologically shy.

97
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,055
He can't talk to women
without drinking alcohol.

98
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,735
OK, look, this never happened.

99
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:09,735
Do you understand me?

100
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:13,175
Really? Still can't talk to me?

101
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:16,695
I think on the surface,
Bernadette is your

102
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:20,695
typical microbiologist,

103
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,455
kind of nerdy.

104
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:26,455
In microbiology, the most exciting
thing I get to work with is yeast.

105
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,615
Erm, but what I love about her
is the fact that we've discovered

106
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:32,095
these layers to her.
She's kind of got a dark side.

107
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,615
Yes.

108
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:34,855
She's got a temper.

109
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:37,055
What the hell is wrong with you?

110
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:39,975
You are always so nice to me,
I thought maybe you liked me.

111
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,815
I'm nice to everyone!

112
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,135
So, what you see necessarily
isn't what you get with her.

113
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,815
If you and Leonard
get back together,

114
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,815
Sheldon and I will finally have
someone to go on double dates with.

115
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:53,175
What about me and Howard?

116
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,255
Fine, we can double with you too.

117
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,415
So insecure.

118
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,735
How would you describe
your character Amy?

119
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,095
She's straightforward,
she's dedicated

120
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,255
and she also knows
how to have a good time.

121
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,455
Oh, I know!

122
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,735
We'll go to a sweat lodge,
take peyote, roll around in mud

123
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,495
and paint fertility symbols
on Bernadette's naked body.

124
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,815
That's happening!

125
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:18,935
So I think she's a pretty
well-rounded person, considering.

126
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,535
Yes, all things being...

127
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:22,615
The only person who
signed my yearbook was my mother.

128
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,455
Aww.

129
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:28,455
"Amy, self-respect and a hymen are
better than friends and fun. Mum."

130
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:35,655
The Big Bang Theory has just hit an
important milestone - 100 episodes.

131
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,015
That's impressive for any show.

132
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,455
The fans loved it from day one,

133
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,975
but did the people
who were actually making the show

134
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:45,695
have an inkling it would go on
to be such a huge success?

135
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,695
Chuck Lorre is the man who,
along with co-creator Bill Prady,

136
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,495
is responsible for the show.

137
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:55,375
In the past 20 years, he's brought
us some of the biggest shows on TV,

138
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,575
including Roseanne
and Two And A Half Men.

139
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,655
What gave you the idea for the show
in the first place?

140
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,655
It started with Prady telling me...

141
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,575
Bill Prady,
the co-creator of the show...

142
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,375
telling me about his life in the '80s
in New York as a computer programmer.

143
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,455
Uh huh.

144
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:12,095
And the guys he was hanging out with
and working with

145
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,775
were all brilliant guys,

146
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:16,535
but they were entirely incompetent
in all other aspects of life.

147
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,655
Yeah.

148
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,495
Oh. Hey, guys.

149
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:20,535
Hey, sorry we're late!

150
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,735
Late?

151
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,055
It's 7.05!

152
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,575
And you said
the party starts at seven.

153
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,055
Well, yeah.

154
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:30,055
When you start a party at seven,
no-one show ups at, you know, seven.

155
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,935
It's 7.05.

156
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:37,135
And that struck us both
as really funny

157
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:41,095
and as a good starting place
for a group of characters
who were extraordinary

158
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:45,095
but were struggling to get on
with the mundane task of living.

159
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:49,535
Why on earth are you telling me
all this?

160
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,255
I don't know.

161
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:53,335
Sometimes your movements
are so lifelike,

162
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:56,455
I forget you're not a real boy.

163
00:07:56,456 --> 00:08:00,455
When you first wrote the pilot,
did you have any kind of sense

164
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:05,455
that it could go on to be
as successful as it has been?

165
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,815
None. None whatsoever.

166
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:10,815
When Johnny Galecki
and Jim Parsons first read together,

167
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:14,015
that was
when we started to have hope.

168
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:14,935
Put this in the bathroom.

169
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:16,095
What for?

170
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,135
I need to measure
my fluid intake and output

171
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,615
to make sure my kidneys
aren't shutting down.

172
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,415
I mix pancake batter in this!

173
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:29,415
I auditioned twice,
and didn't get hired both times.

174
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,895
And they did a pilot
and it didn't work!

175
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,535
We did the pilot twice.

176
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:37,575
You know,
we had two chances to get this right.

177
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:40,415
And they revamped the script
and made it different,

178
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,255
and I came back in
and I guess it was all about timing.

179
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,335
Mm.

180
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:46,775
And I just - clonk! -
knocked it out of the ballpark.

181
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,815
It was like, "Oh, God!
Something's happening here."

182
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:52,735
You could feel
something special was happening.

183
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:56,735
It was very apparent that it
was better than we'd hoped for.

184
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:01,375
I knew it was a true ensemble,
that everyone was just fantastic.

185
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,455
You could sort of sense
where it was going to go,

186
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:09,415
that it was going to kind of
not be making fun of nerdy people

187
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,015
but sort of give them the voice...

188
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,095
Yeah.

189
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:16,255
And make everybody else
sort of the laughing stock.

190
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,135
Who's Adam West?

191
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,255
"Who's Adam West?"

192
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:23,255
Leonard, what do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

193
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,575
The first night shooting,
I think really...

194
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,975
in front of an audience...
is what cemented it for me.

195
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,975
Because they knew the characters
immediately and they pulled for them.

196
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,695
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

197
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:41,695
Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

198
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,255
Really? Why?

199
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:47,255
He's kind of a nerd.

200
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,175
Juice box?

201
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:54,055
The show, ultimately,
is an underdog story

202
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:56,095
and people like to
root for underdogs,

203
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,015
because everyone, in their life,
has felt like an underdog.

204
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,575
What did I ever do to
Jimmy Mullins in the third grade?

205
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:04,415
He still punched me in the face
with my own fists.

206
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,735
That transcends...

207
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,495
cultures, religions, language.

208
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,615
That's why it's such
an international show,

209
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,215
why it's popular all over the world.

210
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:15,295
Whether you're watching the show
and saying, like, "That's me!"

211
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,975
or you're watching it going,
"What's up with these guys?"

212
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,455
There's always something...

213
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:22,175
Everyone can relate to being
an underdog at some point.

214
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,135
Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?

215
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,815
A guest in my trundle bed
and a boy at my door?

216
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:30,095
I wish I could tell 13-year-old me
itdoesget better!

217
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,975
These characters are very lovable,
and I'm not talking about Penny,

218
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,935
even though
she's the most lovable.

219
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,575
But the guys, truthfully...

220
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:40,095
I mean, from day one,
you just fall in love with them.

221
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:43,535
I feel they've made nerdy
and goofy kind of sexy.

222
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,175
♪ Da-daaaaaaa! ♪

223
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,775
I don't think
it's the specific geekiness

224
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,815
or science
or Star Trekky stuff,

225
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,855
cos none of us are really
into that stuff in real life,

226
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:04,135
and I know a lot of people
that aren't that love the show,

227
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:08,135
so I think there's a human connection
to feeling like an outsider

228
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,615
or trying to figure out,
sort of, the...

229
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:15,055
the rules, the handbook of life.

230
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,935
I love that it's
a show about smart people,

231
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:20,455
I love that it's a show about
the quirks of smart people

232
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,695
and sort of
the social dynamics of people

233
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:26,895
other than the Beverly Hills 90210,
Friends, attractive people

234
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,735
hooking up in different permutations
kind of show.

235
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:33,215
Last night, I was strong-armed into
an evening of harp music and spooning

236
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,095
with an emotional
Amy Farrah Fowler.

237
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,415
This on a night that
I had originally designated

238
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:40,614
for solving the space-time geometry
in higher-spin gravity

239
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,615
and building my LEGO Death Star.

240
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,995
There's no denying that the
gang on The Big Bang Theory

241
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:16,755
get themselves into some
peculiar pickles.

242
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:20,435
Over 100 episodes, we've seen some
outrageous behaviour.

243
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:24,235
But what keeps us watching
isn't the wacky antics,

244
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:27,595
it's the relationships.

245
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:30,155
The friendships and romances
on the show

246
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,675
have grown and developed
over the years.

247
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:35,275
The guys have actually made
friends with some girls.

248
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,275
Howard grew out of his bromance with
Raj and found love with Bernadette.

249
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:43,555
Sheldon has a girlfriend
and Leonard and Penny,

250
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:47,155
well, they're just
Leonard and Penny.

251
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,715
It's been an interesting
ride for these two.

252
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:53,715
From their first kiss in episode six
to their break-up in episode 59,

253
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,435
to whatever it is they have now.

254
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:58,795
It's been an on, off, on, off,
delight to watch.

255
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,355
Forgotten the details?

256
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:01,795
Here are the highlights.

257
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:02,955
New neighbour?

258
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,955
Evidently.

259
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,595
What about if you went out with me?

260
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,395
Yes, I will go out with you.

261
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:15,355
Leonard has no business being
involved with a waitress/actress

262
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:18,955
who felt so insecure that she lied
about finishing community college.

263
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:21,835
What about that really long hug.
What did that mean?

264
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:23,875
It means I wish you were going.

265
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,155
Leonard, you're back.

266
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,635
Yes, I just stopped by to say...

267
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:30,355
Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot
and make out.

268
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:34,275
You're a dirty girl.

269
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,435
I love you, Penny.

270
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,675
Thank you.

271
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:41,235
So we're in two different places
emotionally, so what, that's fine.

272
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:44,035
In fact it makes sense
because let's face it,

273
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,555
I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

274
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:48,795
That isn't fair to you, Leonard,
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,715
I screwed up.

276
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,035
Leonard's a great guy.

277
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:53,675
Never should've broken up with him.

278
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:57,155
What's going on?

279
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,475
It's not what it looks like.

280
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:00,795
Do you have plans for dinner?

281
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,355
Why, you guys going somewhere?

282
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:03,275
No, I mean just you and me.

283
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,875
Have you thought this through?

284
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,875
Yes and I think we should go anyway.

285
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,595
I think if I could choose,

286
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:14,515
I would love them to end up
together at the end of the day.

287
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:17,715
Not any time soon,
but you know how relationships are,

288
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:21,555
they go on and off,
you date someone, you break up,

289
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,235
you become friends,
your friends deal with it.

290
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:27,315
Because they're so close, it's
always going to affect everyone.

291
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,955
I like the ride that the writers
are taking them on.

292
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,395
I think it's really fun
and it's real.

293
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:35,315
I have a real soft spot
in my heart for those two

294
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:39,315
and I think they are the loves
of one another's lives.

295
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,675
They just don't have it together
in other areas of their life.

296
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,235
There's a real visceral thing
between the two of them

297
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:49,275
and they both just have
a whole lot to learn.

298
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:53,275
Our babies will be smart
and beautiful.

299
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,195
Not to mention imaginary.

300
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:02,195
One couple, who despite all odds,
do seem to have it together,

301
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:03,715
are Sheldon and Amy.

302
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:05,835
I love the Amy and Sheldon
relationship

303
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,195
cos I think
it's a very different kind of sweet.

304
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,155
It's a very different kind
of tender.

305
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,435
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are,

306
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,395
in descending order of likelihood,

307
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,155
hyperthyroidism,
premature menopause,

308
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,195
hosting an alien parasite...

309
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:23,195
Or, and I only include it
for the sake of covering all bases,

310
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:27,875
sexual arousal.

311
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:31,795
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

312
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:35,795
Amy and Sheldon are in
the relationship agreement phase.

313
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:39,835
A binding covenant
that in 31 pages enumerates,

314
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,835
iterates and codifies the rights
and responsibilities

315
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:46,035
of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after
known as "the boyfriend',

316
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:50,035
and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and
after known as "the girlfriend".

317
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,515
It's so romantic.

318
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,955
It's just this beautifully
odd situation,

319
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,595
he seems to really enjoy her company.

320
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:02,475
And, erm,

321
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:06,475
there's obviously slight
attraction/attachment there.

322
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,075
That has just sort of come upon him.

323
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:14,075
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

324
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,835
There was a lot of pressure from fans

325
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:21,915
that he be in a romantic
relationship.

326
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,795
But... I didn't want to

327
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:27,515
miss out on an opportunity
to have a character

328
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:29,915
living life on his own terms.

329
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,075
That's what wonderful
about these characters,

330
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:35,075
particularly Jim's character,
he's living life on his own terms.

331
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,395
Proposal...

332
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,155
one wild night of torrid love-making

333
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:43,115
that soothes my soul
and enflames my loins.

334
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:44,675
Whether you agree with it or not.

335
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,435
Whether you agree with how
he's having a relationship with

336
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:50,115
Amy Farrah Fowler...
that's the relationship.

337
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,955
They've established a relationship
that works for them.

338
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,435
And... I think that's admirable.

339
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:59,235
Counter proposal...

340
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:02,315
I will gently stroke your head,

341
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:05,475
and repeat, "Aw, who's a good Amy?"

342
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:08,115
Rounding out the trio of couples
on the show

343
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:10,395
are the pint-sized
Howard and Bernadette.

344
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,395
When the show started did you ever
think that Howard would get engaged?

345
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:17,275
Ha! No.

346
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:20,355
You know, I thought
he would be killed off or something.

347
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,075
Erm, yeah,

348
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:25,275
he's certainly not
the first to find love.

349
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,875
Yes, I will marry you.

350
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,115
You will? I will!

351
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,155
Oh, I love you so much.

352
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,995
I love you too!

353
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:34,995
It was erm, just a perfect storm of,
for whatever reason,

354
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,795
these two people balance
each other out.

355
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,595
Don't take him too seriously,

356
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:43,075
a lot of what
he says is intended as humour.

357
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:45,275
Yeah, well I don't think
it's very funny.

358
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:49,275
Me neither.
But he just lights up when I laugh.

359
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:53,355
I think that, these characters,
there's so much love between them,

360
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:57,355
so whether they actually marry or
they don't, I think it'll be great.

361
00:17:57,596 --> 00:17:59,795
What is that behind your ear?

362
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:03,795
Look, it's a condom.

363
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,955
Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.

364
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,595
The Big Bang Theory is about
more than romance, of course.

365
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:14,875
It's about friendships
and those can be the most

366
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,435
entertaining relationships
on the show.

367
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:20,035
My favourite... come on, easy...
Howard and Raj.

368
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:22,315
To friendship.

369
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:26,315
How would you describe
Raj's friendship with Howard?

370
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,035
It's a bromance.

371
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,195
It's a classic bromance.

372
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:33,195
All right, honey, if we're going to
make the movie we should go.

373
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:39,435
This may be hard for you to hear
but when I say, "honey",

374
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,595
I mean my fiancee.

375
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:46,435
Yeah, well, now it means her.

376
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:50,435
I think it can be misconstrued
into a physical relationship,

377
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:54,835
that they have the physical
hots for each other.

378
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,075
That's not happening.

379
00:18:56,076 --> 00:18:58,475
There are a lot of girls out there
who want to kiss you.

380
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,235
Where?

381
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:04,235
You just have to look.

382
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:08,875
N-o-o-o-o-o.

383
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:20,835
Well, this was fun!

384
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:23,835
There have been so many memorable
Big Bang Theory moments.

385
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:25,595
Some of my personal favourites are

386
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,635
Sheldon dressed as a Doppler
Effect...

387
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:31,635
I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler Effect.

388
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,035
Howard's robot arm...
incident.

389
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:39,035
You slipped
and fell into a robot hand?!

390
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,235
Yes.

391
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:45,755
Penis first?!

392
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:47,635
That's not important.

393
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,995
Which moments stick in the minds
of the cast and creators.

394
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:54,995
There was an episode where I... they
wanted Sheldon to learn to drive.

395
00:19:56,436 --> 00:20:00,435
There was this simulation exercise
he had on the TV with the video

396
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,915
game to practise driving.

397
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,235
Slow it! Hit the brake,
hit the brake!

398
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:11,195
The commitment of everybody
as one group to get it done,

399
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:13,155
it was sheer joy.

400
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:17,155
I liked the one where Howard cries
to Penny, and then tries to kiss her

401
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,915
and gets punched.

402
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,915
Hm.

403
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,715
Obviously the tiara scene...

404
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:37,275
Sheldon, you are the most shallow,
self-centred person I have ever met.

405
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:40,435
Do you ever think that another
transparently manipulative...

406
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:42,435
Oh, it's a tiara!
A tiara, I have a tiara!

407
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:44,835
Put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me!

408
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:48,835
Put it on me! Put it on me!
Put it on me! Put it on me!

409
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,275
Do you have a favourite
scene or episode?

410
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,795
Oh, goodness, erm,

411
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,715
I'm kind of a fan girl
about this show.

412
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:01,715
The scene where Penny gave Sheldon
a letter Nimoy autographed,

413
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:04,675
I think was one of my most favourite
moments.

414
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:08,675
"To Sheldon, live long and prosper...

415
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:13,555
"Leonard Nimoy."

416
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,915
He came into the restaurant,
sorry, the napkin is dirty,

417
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,155
he wiped his mouth with it.

418
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:23,235
The gift was a wonderful gesture,

419
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:27,235
but the moment that everybody
was struck by was, we had this

420
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:32,475
character who was so disaffected
and so, you know, alienated from

421
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:36,755
people, hugging her in that moment
cos he was so overcome with joy.

422
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:44,875
We're making a situation comedy here
and we have to make one

423
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,715
every week but you know,
everyone on set is crying!

424
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:49,155
It got very emotional.

425
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:53,155
Leonard, look,
Sheldon's hugging me!

426
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,715
Now, just because there are
so many great moments in the past

427
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,875
doesn't mean there won't be lots of
great moments in the future...

428
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:01,475
on the contrary... there will be.

429
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,955
What they'll come up with
is anybody's guess.

430
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,115
Here we go, into the future.

431
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:11,115
Do you have hopes and thoughts
for Sheldon in the future?

432
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,715
What would I want for him?

433
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:15,835
That he wins the Nobel finally?

434
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,355
I mean, that's like getting a couple
together at the end of an episode.

435
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,435
Where's his fight then?

436
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,875
Do I want him
and Amy to have test tube baby?

437
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,475
I don't want to have to work with a
child ever week on this set, so no...

438
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,555
That's important!

439
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:32,555
Do you have hopes
and aspirations for Howard's future?

440
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:36,915
For the better of his own
being I hope

441
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:40,395
he can manage to get out from under

442
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,915
his mother's fat thumb.

443
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,915
I don't know if they'll actually
make it down the aisle,

444
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,875
if they will or won't.

445
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:50,075
I want them to get married
because I think if we see that scene

446
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:53,075
then presumably Howard's mother
will have to be there.

447
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,435
At the actual wedding,

448
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:56,515
she could serve us, I guess. Yeah.

449
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:58,875
I hope Penny gets another job...

450
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,675
Mm-hm... than working at
The Cheesecake Factory.

451
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,075
She's good there, though.

452
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:05,515
She is really good
at The Cheesecake Factory

453
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,875
but I'm kind of sick of the uniform.

454
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:11,355
So I'd love to maybe work at Sushi.

455
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,355
Do you feel like Raj will eventually
be able to talk to girls?

456
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:17,475
Without the aid of drink?

457
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:20,195
I don't know.
If not drink it'll be something else.

458
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:23,595
Hard to believe we've already had
100 episodes of the Big Bang Theory.

459
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:25,555
But we have. Here's to 100 more.

460
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,715
We're not writing Lost.

461
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,635
We have no idea where this is going.

462
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:33,635
Big deal,
not knowing is part of the fun.
