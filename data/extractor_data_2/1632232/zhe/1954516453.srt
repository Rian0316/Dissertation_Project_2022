1
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,120

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,300
Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,650
Buona sera.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,940
It means good evening in Italian.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,170
May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,490
the authenticity of your ristorante?

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,550
Okay, I'm out of here.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,800
Un momento.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,580
Oh, for heaven's sake.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,390
Now you're being deliberately stupid.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,720
Where are you going?

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,510
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,460
I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,810
But tonight's Thursday.

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,810
On Thursdays, everybody comes over here

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,900
and has pizza.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,830
Or a reasonable facsimile

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,960
prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi,

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,490
but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.

20
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,390
Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,440
We could.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,080
We could also stop using the letter "M,"

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,230
but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,920
Just come with me to Raj's.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,570
Well, I don't want to go to a party.

26
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,440
It's not a party. It's the same group of people

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,330
who hang out here hanging out over there.

28
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,290
I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.

29
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,870
How come it's not a party when we do it here?

30
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,620
Because we don't throw parties.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,760
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there.

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,230
You coming or not?

34
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, no, sir, and do you know why?

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,740
In a word:

36
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,930
tradition.

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,020
Every Thursday night for the last eight years,

38
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,720
you and I and our friends have gathered here

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,040
in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce,

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,890
discuss the issues of the day,

41
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,170
and yes, share a laugh or two.

42
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,650
But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,710
I guess you're right.

44
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,730
- See you later. - Wait!

45
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,770
Leonard! Wait!

46
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,270
What am I going to do for dinner?

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,290
Come with me to Raj's and eat there.

48
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,770
I can't do that.

49
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,530
What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?

50
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,720
I really doubt that's what he'll serve.

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
But what if he does?

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,420
I'll be obliged to dine

53
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,250
on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach.

54
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,870
And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing.

55
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,800
I don't know why he's serving both.

56
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,110
What do you want to do?

57
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,150
You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?

58
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,320
No, I'll go to your haggis party.

59
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,820
But I'm telling you.

60
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,290
This is adness. This is utter and complete adness.

69
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,240
Oh, dear!

70
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,600
- What? - Raj's television.

71
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,280
I just realized

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,980
we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen

73
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,230
with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.

74
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,330
So don't watch TV.

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,410
Read a book.

76
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,760
And be a social pariah?

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,570
Oh, you know that's not my style.

78
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,180
The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,440
Right.

80
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,960
Is it about me or the dead pixels?

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,770
Hey, you're just in time.

82
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,870
We made Tex-Mex.

83
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,870
Oh, sounds great.

84
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,250
Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex.

85
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,200
Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.

86
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey, you.

87
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,400
Hi.

88
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,190
That's got to be fun for you, huh?

89
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,780
Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva

90
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,520
out of your sister's mouth?

91
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,730
Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further,

92
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,340
we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.

93
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,180
There is no assigned seats, Sheldon.

94
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,040
Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,940
Oh, what fun.

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,210
We're like hippies at a love-in.

97
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,670
Just sit here.

98
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,250
Right on, man. Right on.

99
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,890
Oh, look.

100
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,980
it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,630
Okay, we've got fajitas

102
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,150
with all the fixins, so you make your own.

103
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,280
Wonderful.

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,440
Dinner, some assembly required.

105
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,880
Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?

106
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,610
A margarita?!

107
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,540
Where are we?! What is happening?!

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,470
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

109
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,670
What can I get you?

110
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,580
Water. Neat.

111
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,150
With a little umbrella.

112
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,800
Where are all your friends?

113
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,090
Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight,

114
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,790
roaming these mean streets alone.

115
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
A windbreaker for my cape,

116
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,510
and a stern expression for my cowl.

117
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,470
Okay.

118
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,010
Excuse me?

119
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,740
Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep

120
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,630
absentmindedly wipes down the bar

121
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,870
and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,750
Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right.

123
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,780
What's troubling you, buddy?

124
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,810
I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked...

125
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,090
Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister,

126
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,710
we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.

127
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,320
Oh, the horror.

128
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,620
Indeed.

129
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,290
Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music,

130
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,860
and his sister took off her shoes.

131
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,470
It was like the last days of Caligula.

132
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,470

133
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,490
Oh, I have to get this.

134
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,570
Umbrella?

135
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,500
Wonder what she's exasperated about.

136
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,010
Hello?

137
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,500
Sheldon, are you all right?

138
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,810
When last we spoke, you were going to

139
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,440
take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook,

140
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.

141
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,130
Yes, I was in a taxi,

142
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,230
but the driver didn't look at all

143
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,030
like the photograph on his license,

144
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,020
so I leapt out and ran for it.

145
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,310
Wise.

146
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,450
There you go.

147
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,290
Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.

148
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,780
Hi, bestie.

149
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,230
Oh. Hi, Amy.

150
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,040
How you been?

151
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,360
Fine.

152
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,870
From this angle, I can see up your nose.

153
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,980
Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?

154
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,060
Don't worry. My problems can wait

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,390
while you two hens finish your clucking.

156
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya.

157
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
She is staying with Raj.

158
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,810
That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.

159
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,380
Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

160
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,500
I know you're devastated

161
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,650
that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover

162
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,960
with flawless, caramel-colored skin.

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,670
Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.

164
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,340
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.

165
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,850
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

166
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,770
Sheldon, look at me.

167
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,960
I think it's time

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,820
to face the fact

169
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,080
that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.

170
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Where he goes, the group goes.

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,390
Leonard the nucleus?

172
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,950
That makes no sense.

173
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm the whimsical elf

174
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
that everyone looks to for a good time.

175
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm not saying that you're not fun.

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,300
You're the most fun person I know.

177
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,510
A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.

178
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,640
Don't be needy, bestie.

179
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,410
That's probably part of what chased Leonard away.

180
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,750
What I am saying, Sheldon,

181
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
is that your group is Leonard-centric.

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,530
If it were a town, it would be Leonardville.

183
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,360
If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan.

184
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,420
If it were the birthplace of motion pictures,

185
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,010
we'd all be singing "Hooray for Leonardwood."

186
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,460
Ooh, I got one.

187
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,600
If you guys were a band,

188
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,160
you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.

189
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,050
So needy.

190
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,300
What you doing?

191
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,430
I'm setting out snacks.

192
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,180
You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight.

193
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,070

194
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,070
I didn't say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

195
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,330
You're having people over?

196
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,240
Yes. Must be killing you wondering who.

197
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
Fine, I'll tell you.

198
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,990
Stuart from the comic bookstore,

199
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,760
Barry Kripke from the university,

200
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,520
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack

201
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,310
and TV's LeVar Burton.

202
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,180
Really?

203
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,850
LeVar Burton's coming here?

204
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,860
Possibly. I Tweeted him.

205
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,980
Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.

206
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,420
Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.

207
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,150
Of course. Good night.

208
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,860
- Leonard. - Yeah?

209
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,410
We had a good run, you and I.

210
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,190
Okay.

211
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,180
But change is a part of life.

212
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,150
It certainly is.

213
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,630
Okay.

214
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,930
I have guests coming.

215
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,430
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.

216
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,290
I am leaving.

217
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,420
Don't make this harder than it is, Leonard.

218
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,600
Good-bye, Sheldon.

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,540
And good-bye to you, sir.

220
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,090
He'll be back.

221
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,200
Of course I'll be back. I live here!

222
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,060
Well, it would appear

223
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,580
LeVar Burton won't be joining us.

224
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,430
Let's get started.

225
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,940
I thought we'd begin by going around the room,

226
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,240
introducing ourselves

227
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,650
and saying a little bit about why we're here.

228
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,960
Okay. I'm Sheldon.

229
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,250
Uh, for regular readers

230
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,360
of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics,

231
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,090
I need no introduction.

232
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
If you're not familiar with that publication,

233
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,540
there's a free copy in your goody bag.

234
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,750
Stuart?

235
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,290
Um... Hi. I'm Stuart.

236
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,170
I run a comic bookstore,

237
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,370
which for financial reasons, I'm currently living in.

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,290
I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.

239
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,340
It's very nice, Stuart.

240
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,360
Zack?

241
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,540
I'm Zack, and I'm, uh...

242
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,110
uh...

243
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,500
Could you come back to me?

244
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,450
Of course.

245
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,350
Barry?

246
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,450
I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here

247
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,790
because you told me there was going to be a whaffle.

248
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,650
When is the whaffle?

249
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,230
Patience, patience, Barry.

250
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,130
The whaffle...

251
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,680
The raffle is the grand finale

252
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,390
to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.

253
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,960
- One more question... - Yes, you must be present to win.

254
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,600
Okay, I'm ready.

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,460
I'm Zach, and I'm, uh...

256
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,470
Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

257
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,110
Oh, hey.

258
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,880
- Hi. - Yo, P-dog.

259
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,860
What's up?

260
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,410
We're here to kidnap you for a girls' night out.

261
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,170
Parenthetical: the term "Kidnap" is being used playfully.

262
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,150
I kind of figured that.

263
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,800
Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.

264
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,930
No.

265
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,950
She used to be much more fun,

266
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,900
until Leonard punched her in the heart.

267
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,820
We just thought you might want to go out

268
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,230
and have a good time, maybe go dancing.

269
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,870
Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.

270
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,650
You do understand that it will distract you

271
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,910
from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving

272
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,730
that your ex-boyfriend

273
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,770
is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

274
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,400
Okay, look,

275
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,730
if I agree to go out with you guys,

276
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,240
will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?

277
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,550
- Yes. - Sure.

278
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,390
All right. I'll go change. Come on in.

279
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,460
If you'd have let me bring the chloroform,

280
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,730
we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.

281
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,050
Anyway, after we get done snowboarding,

282
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,270
I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

283
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,580
There's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it.

284
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,010
Next thing I know,

285
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,420
this beautiful chick shows up,

286
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,750
drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.

287
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,770
Question.

288
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,860
Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

289
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,760
Really? That's your question?

290
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,770
What's the difference?

291
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,680
"Jacuzzi" is a commercial brand.

292
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
"Hot tub" is the generic term.

293
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,710
I.E., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs,

294
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,580
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

295
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,160
Is that like all thumbs are fingers,

296
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,610
but not all fingers are thumbs?

297
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,310
Surprisingly, yes.

298
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,390
Nice.

299
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,280
Now, what exactly are toes?

300
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,760
Can you please get back to the drunk girl?

301
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,140
I'd like something to think about in the shower.

302
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,730
Oh, yeah.

303
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,830
Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes,

304
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,250
climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice...

305
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,270
The water level rose.

306
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,900
No.

307
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,830
Of course it did.

308
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,560
It's said that Archimedes,

309
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,140
the ancient Greek mathematician,

310
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,150
discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.

311
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,190
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.

312
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,560
Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.

313
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,700
Forgive me, but I think you'll find

314
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,610
my story is more interesting.

315
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,060
Does yours have wet breasts in it?

316
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,180
Better.

317
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,750
It has a gold crown.

318
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,570
You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it

319
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,130
and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution.

320
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,300
Because the crown was irregularly shaped,

321
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,570
there was no way to mathematically determine its volume.

322
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,470
But, while bathing, Archimedes realized

323
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,140
he could immerse the crown

324
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,200
and measure the amount the water rose.

325
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,050
So, long story short, I nailed her.

326
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,950
When he finished, he shouted "Eureka!"

327
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,150
No, I always shout, "Holy moly!"

328
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,720
Don't know why. Just do.

329
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,700
All right,

330
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
that concludes the "Getting to know you" Portion of the evening.

331
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,400
Who's ready to play some vintage video games?

332
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,340
And tonight's selections include

333
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,740
ColecoVision's "Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle,"

334
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,160
Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch,"

335
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,200
and for you text adventure aficionados,

336
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,670
"Zork."

337
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,730
Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.

338
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,930
That all sucks the big hairy meatball.

339
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,740
How about I go get the karaoke machine out of my car,

340
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,260
get plastered and blow the roof off this place?

341
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
Great, I'll make a beer run.

342
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,580
And I'll take a shower.

343
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
We'll meet back here in 15.

344
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,400
Check.

345
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm unhappy.

346
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,930
This is delicious.

347
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,690
Where'd you learn to make chili?

348
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,640
When I was at university in England,

349
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,050
my flatmate was from Texas.

350
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,270
I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.

351
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,930
Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?

352
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,960
Oh, please. That crazy bastard's looking

353
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,580
at quirky in the rearview mirror.

354
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,310
Did you know that, per our roommate agreement,

355
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,190
I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower?

356
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,380
And not in the sink.

357
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,590
We each have special buckets.

358
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,350
Raj, did you ever tell your sister

359
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,330
about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?

360
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,080
- Oh, God, you're kidding. - Nope.

361
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,770
Gates gave a speech at the university.

362
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,510
Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said,

363
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,810
"Maybe if you weren't so distracted

364
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,430
by sick children in Africa,

365
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,490
you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista."

366
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,110
Bam. Right in the nose.

367
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,920
Made me proud to own a PC.

368
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,580
I'd like to propose a toast

369
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,650
to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.

370
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,170
- Hear, hear. - Cheers.

371
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,540
You realize that's the first time we've ever done that

372
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,150
without having to listen to Sheldon tell us

373
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,700
why it's called a toast?

374
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,310
Why is it called a toast?

375
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,560
Oh, the ancient Romans

376
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
put spiced toast in their punch bowls.

377
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,040
Sheldon tells it better.

378
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,660
- He kind of does. - Yeah.

379
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,030
Aw, hell, I miss him.

380
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,630
So, where do you guys want to go dancing?

381
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,630
We were hoping you'd know a place.

382
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,440
Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly

383
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,950
with young, beautiful bodies

384
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,460
sweating and writhing against each other

385
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,690
in a glorious orgy of the flesh.

386
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh, yeah, I know that place.

387
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,240
What do you think?

388
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,700
That should display enough of your bosom

389
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,480
to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.

390
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,250
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

391
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,740
Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend

392
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,520
does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.

393
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,570
But you could if you wanted to, right?

394
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,260
Well, yeah, I guess.

395
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,760
Pick out the hottest guy in the room,

396
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,120
take him home, do unspeakable things to him,

397
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,330
then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face

398
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,800
and teeth marks on his heinie?

399
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,390
More or less.

400
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,930
What's that like?

401
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,680
I don't know.

402
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,970
It's fun while you're doing it.

403
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,400
And then after, it's mostly embarrassment,

404
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,920
self-loathing and regret.

405
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,880
I would take that deal all day long.

406
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,370
Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight.

407
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,830
You know, for the first time in my life,

408
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,430
I am not in a relationship,

409
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,060
and I'm totally okay with it.

410
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,370
You know, if being on your own is new to you,

411
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,060
I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques

412
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,760
for ladies I've perfected over the years.

413
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,280
For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?

414
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,170
Um, no.

415
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,940
You should get one.

416
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,180
What's that?

417
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,950
It appears to be something preserved

418
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,010
between two pieces of acrylic.

419
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,920
Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole.

420
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,100
Leonard gave it to me last year.

421
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,610
Oh, God, that is so romantic.

422
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,360
Yeah, it was.

423
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,960
Leonard's really one of a kind.

424
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,500
Saying that while holding a snowflake

425
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,850
is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?

426
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,820
Let me see that.

427
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,230
Oh, screw it.

428
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,610
I can deal with a little self-loathing.

429
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,900
Let's go find me a heinie to bite.

430
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,150
Outstanding.

431
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,060
And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS

432
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,510
and pick you out a nice toothbrush.

433
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,960
I call mine "Gerard."

434
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,600
That's kind of creepy.

435
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,440

436
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,440
* Don't go breaking my heart *

437
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,870
* I couldn't if I tried *

438
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,730
* Oh, honey, if I get restless *

439
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,660
* Baby, you're not that kind *

440
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,240
* Don't go breaking my heart *

441
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,320
Anybody do "Walking on Sunshine" Yet?

442
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,130
No.

443
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,620
Dibs.

444
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,010
I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom

445
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,270
and learned how to weave?

446
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,640
He actually got pretty good.

447
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,900
He made us all matching serapes.

448
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,770
I still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.

449
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,330
Now, was this before

450
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,400
or after he adopted the 25 cats?

451
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,290
Long before the cats.

452
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,680
I think it was around the time he tried

453
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,790
to declare our apartment a sovereign nation.

454
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,640
I still have some of the currency.

455
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,370
All my friends.

456
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,190
All my friends.

457
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,720
All my friends.

458
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,480
I think it's like Beetlejuice.

459
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,550
We said his name too many times.

460
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,110
- Come on in. - Thank you.

461
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,550
Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.

462
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,000
I had to leave.

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,990
They were having fun wrong.

464
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,810
Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.

465
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,060
Thank you.

466
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,700
Would you like some homemade chili?

467
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,770
Are there beans in it?

468
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,700
Yes.

469
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,920
Then it's not chili.

470
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,150
Real chili has no beans in it,

471
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,680
but you're from a foreign land,

472
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,890
so your ignorance is forgiven.

473
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,990
Sheldon, do you want some or not?

474
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,480
Yes, please.

475
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,910
Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.

476
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,960
I'd like to propose a toast

477
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,240
to friends, no matter how quirky.

478
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,750
Cheers.

479
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,640
Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?

480
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,090
Actually, I do.

481
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,090
I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast

482
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,810
in their punch bowls.

483
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,400
She's also a bit of a know-it-all.

484
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,860
Mmm. This is good.

485
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,660
Whatever it is.

486
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,790

487
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,790
* I'm walking on sunshine *

488
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,650
* I'm walking on sunshine *

489
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,550
Hello? I...

490
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,810
* I'm walking on sunshine *

491
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,110
Oh, I don't think so.

492
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,630
I am so done with Twitter.
