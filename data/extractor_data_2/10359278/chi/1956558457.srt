闯祸的是我

00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,570
看起来我只剩六个月的时间了
It seems I only have six months to live.

六个月
Six months!

25
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,480
我想着一刀两断更好...
I thought a clean break was just better for...

26
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,420
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

27
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,950
他单膝跪地  问我愿不愿意嫁给他

Six months.

你知道你丈夫是同性恋吗

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,700
他也患上了在同性恋男子群体中肆虐的那种疾病
He has that new disease that all the gay men are spreading.

33
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,660
你在说谎
That's a lie.

34
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,230
他是我丈夫见过的第三位患者

前两个都已经死了

36
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,950
你需要关照

37
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,580
你觉得我会在这种时候离开你
Karl, you think I'd leave you at a time like this?

38
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,080
取消旅行
Cancel the trip?

39
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,110
这不公平
That's not fair.

40
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,660
这本应是我这辈子最棒的一个夏天
This was supposed to be the best summer of my life.

41
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,030
这也可能是卡尔一生里最后一个夏天
And this could be the last summer of Karl's life,

42
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,540
所以拜托别生气了

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
这是什么鬼
What in the world?

47
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,580
那是文身吗
Is that a tattoo?

48
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,080
以后情变了肯定会后悔的
One of these days he'll regret that.

49
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,520
她也会后悔的
So will she.

50

-哇  -看到了吧
- Oh. Wow. - Right?

51
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,020
-你给我买了一辆车  -我说了我会照顾你的
- You bought me a car? - I said I would take care of you.

52
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,080
你不能把车退掉  车不是你的
You can't return the car. It's not yours.

53
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,580
但他是因为嗑药嗑疯了才买的
Yeah, but he's coked out of his mind.

54
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,180
接受一个这种情况下男人送的礼物  "吃相"可不太好看
To accept a gift from a man in that condition is not a good look.

55
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,880
-钥匙给我  -够了
- Just give me the keys. - Stop it.

56

上楼  收拾你的东西
Go upstairs, get your stuff!

57
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,150
我要你立刻离开我家
I want you out of my house now!

58
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,460
想得美
That's not gonna happen.

59
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,000
我能帮上你什么忙
How can I help?

60
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,790
把你知道的关于洁德的一切都告诉我
Tell me everything you know about Jade.

61
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,200
首先  那不是她的真名

我在两年多前去世
I was killed over two years ago,

66
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,490
但我妈妈还是会每天都想着我
but my mama still thinks about me every day.

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,000
就连她涂口红的时候
Even when she's just putting on lipstick,

68
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,150
她也会突然想起她有多爱我
she'll suddenly remember how much she loved me.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
我从天堂上俯视着妈妈
I look down on Mama from heaven.

70
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,250
我看着她因为我担心她

她不幸福
She's not happy,

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,400
但爸爸不知道
but Daddy doesn't know

73
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,020
因为她总是在微笑

妈妈很生他的气

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,470
你今天有什么计划
So, what have you got planned for the day?

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,970
没什么
Oh, nothing much.

78

我会和一个新朋友聚会
I'll be spending time with a new friend.

79

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,200
琼恩[六月]

81
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,660
我感觉你会很喜欢她

82
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,600
你们俩要做什么
And what are you two doing?

83
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,420
我会开车送她去看医生
I offered to drive her to a doctor's appointment,

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,110
但这只不过是
but that's really just an excuse

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
我想找她谈她在交往的那男人的借口
for me to talk to her about the man she's seeing.

86
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,670
为什么
Why?

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,970
我不赞同这段关系
I don't approve of the relationship,

88
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,310
所以我决定让他们分手
so I've decided to break them up.

89
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,090
贝丝・安  这可不好
Beth Ann, that's not nice.

90
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,900
也许吧
Maybe not,

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,750

我的贱老婆就这么成了寡妇

我时不时地会来看看我儿子怎么样

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,740
可以自己做决定

你不用再保护她
You don't have to protect her anymore.

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,300
我也不生气
And I am not angry,

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,790
至少不生你的气

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,810

对  在举办慈善晚宴之间

似乎萨蒙妮在性骚扰我儿子
it seems that Simone has been molesting my son,

120
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,230
可能已经多年了

121
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,960
如果你允许她来探视或者给他打电话
If you allow her to visit or even phone him,

122

我就告你们医院  最后我会赢的

不用因为我而慎重
No need to be discreet on my account.

128
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,030
我打算告诉全镇的人
I intend on telling everyone in this town

我叫弗娜・罗伊

32岁的时候我死于一场火灾
I was 32 when I died in a fire.

133

当时
At the time,

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,780
我是这里这个女孩的养母
I was a foster mother to this one right here.

135
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,950
我不喜欢说活人的坏话
I don't like to talk bad about the living,

136
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,420
但这个孩子真是坏透了
but this gal's pure poison.

137
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,830
我看到她现在住在
I can see she's now living

138
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,700
有着各种精美家具的豪宅里
in a fancy house with pretty things.

139
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,230
这意味着已经有男人被她迷住了
That means some man has fallen for her act.

140
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,470
伊莱  你要迟到了
Eli, you're gonna be late!

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,120

他可不知道她的能耐
He don't know what she's capable of,

143
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,080
但是我有预感他马上就要发现了
but I got a feeling he's about to find out.

144
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,730
你今天的动作有点迟钝
Moving kind of slow today.

145
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,790
你昨晚给我吃了什么  马用镇静剂吗
What did you give me last night, a horse tranquilizer?

146
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,330
如果你能在晚上十点以后就别再吸食
Well, I wouldn't have to give you anything

147
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,330
我当然不会让你吃任何东西了
if you'd stop doing coke after 10:00.

148
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,150
你说得我好像有自制力似的
You talk like I have self-control.

149
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,250
你都要让我觉得尴尬了
I'm almost embarrassed for you.

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,490
随便吧  快看
Well, whatever. Here, look.

151
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,080
我给你准备了惊喜
I've got a surprise.

152
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,750
有什么特别的事情吗
Whoa. What's the occasion?

153
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,880
今天是斯科塞斯日
It's Scorsese day.

154
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,580
听着  只是一个会议而已
Oh, look, it's just a meeting.

155
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,940
我觉得能让他导演我电影的可能性
I mean, the odds of him directing my movie

156
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,960
大概是一百万分之一吧
are, like, a million to one.

157
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,540
他很喜欢你的剧本  我想这是件大事
He loved your script. I think that's a big deal.

158
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,990
天哪  我只希望能在10点前清醒过来
God, I just-- I hope I can burn this off by 10:00.

159
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,150
我现在感觉很不在状态
I feel so out of it.

160
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,280
那你走运了
Well, luckily for you,

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,640
我知道如何准备"营养均衡"的一餐
I know how to prepare a well-balanced meal.

162
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,060
你把我照顾得太好了
Mmm. You take such good care of me.

163
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,370
斯科塞斯会执导你的电影的  我确信
Scorsese's gonna direct your movie, I know it,

164
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,450
而且会非常成功  我们会变得无比富有
and it's gonna be a big hit and we are going to be so rich.

165
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,680
借你吉言
From your lips...

166
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,660
我就知道有天我会遇到非常令人激动的事
I always knew something exciting would happen to me one day.

167
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,250
我想就是这事了
I think this is it.

168
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,660
再说一次  真的只是一个会议
Again, all right, it's just a meeting.

169
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,830
我一点都不担心
I'm not worried.

170
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,970
今年我的梦想都会实现
This is the year where all my dreams come true.

171
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,370
你好  珍妮
Hello, Jenny.

172
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,750
格罗夫夫妇
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Grove.

173
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,090
请告诉我你们今晚有嫩煎小牛肉片
Please tell me you have the veal piccata tonight.

174
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
就是能吃到这口美味的想法让我今天精神饱满
Just the thought of it has kept me going all day.

175
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,910
很抱歉  我无法为两位安排座位
I'm sorry, but I can't seat you.

176
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,800
你们不是又客满了吧
Oh... oh, you're not overbooked again?

177
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,830
我看见我们常坐的桌子是空的
Well, I see our usual table is empty.

178
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,480
我不知道你把它订给谁了
I don't know who you promised it to,

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,620
但他们应该早点来的
but they should have gotten here sooner.

180
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,800
请坐  亲爱的
Here we are, my darling.

181
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,320
谢谢
Thank you.

182
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,620
-好了  -不管如何
- There we go. - Anyway,

183
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,780
我一直想找医院里的汤米
I've been trying to talk to Tommy in the hospital,

184
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,410
但是我却总也联系不到他
but I can't seem to get through to him.

185
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,570
真奇怪
It's bizarre.

186
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,870
抱歉  亲爱的  是我的幻觉
Sorry, darling, is it my imagination,

187
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,120
还是真的大家都在看我们
or are people staring at us?

188
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,600
我今天穿的可是纪梵希
I'm wearing Givenchy.

189
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,500
我穿纪梵希的时候人们总会盯着我看
They always stare when I wear Givenchy.

190
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,140
不是  我觉得他们只是在盯着我看
No, no, I think, actually, they're just staring at me.

191
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,700
你说得没错
You're right.

192
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,140
肯定是因为你的外套
It must be your jacket.

193
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,660
我跟你说过格子花呢过时了
I told you plaid is over.

194
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,850
格罗夫夫妇
Mr. And Mrs. Grove.

195
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,640
亨利  见到你真高兴
Oh, Henry, how lovely to see you.

196
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,940
真的非常抱歉  但恐怕
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid

197
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,000
我不得不请两位离开
I have to ask you to leave.

198
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,750
上帝啊  他可以把外套脱掉的
Oh, for God's sake, he can take the jacket off.

199
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,710
怎么回事
What's wrong?

200
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,160
应该有人通知过你们了
Someone should have notified you.

201
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,620
两位在俱乐部的会员资格被取消了
Your membership to the club has been revoked.

202
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,110
开玩笑的吧
You can't be serious.

203
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,160
委员会下午召开了会议  投票是一致通过的
The committee met this afternoon. The vote was unanimous.

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,430
我们...我们在这家俱乐部15年了
W... We've belonged to this club for 15 years.

205
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,580
为什么你们要把我们踢出去
Why on earth would you want to kick us out?

206
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,120
因为我生病了  对不对
It's because I'm ill, isn't it?

207
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,950
我们需要保护自己的会员
We have to protect our members.

208
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,970
这种病是通过性传播的
It's a sexually transmitted disease.

209
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,160
共用网球场是不会传染的
You don't get it by sharing a fucking tennis court.

210
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,450
无论如何  两位的会员合约里有道德条款
All the same, your membership contract has a morals clause.

211
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,170
这里这么多的人
Of all the people here,

212
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,100
你觉得没道德的是我们
you think we're the ones who lack morals?

213
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,160
那边的梅森・里德吸食海洛因成瘾
Mason Reed over there is addicted to heroin,

214
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,010
苏珊・保罗在跟自己的姐夫上床
and Susan Paul is sleeping with her brother-in-law.

215
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,250
你更不想知道俱乐部的桑拿房里会发生什么
And you don't want to know what happens in the club sauna.

216
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,600
你这是在帮倒忙
That's not helpful.

217
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,200
我最后说一遍  格罗夫夫妇  请离开
For the last time, Mr. And Mrs. Grove, please go.

218
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,660
走吧
Shall we?

219
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,710
不知道您介不介意
Would you mind terribly...

220
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,070
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

221
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,310
再见  亨利
Goodbye, Henry.

222
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,730
真有你的  亲爱的
Good for you, dear.

223
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,710
别担心  亨利  我的我会喝掉
Oh, don't worry, Henry, I'm gonna drink mine.

224
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,250
再次感谢你给我推荐的产科医师
Thank you again for recommending this obstetrician.

225
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,290
我跟他电话里聊过了  感觉他很棒
I talked to him on the phone, he sounds wonderful.

226
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,090
希拉
Sheila?

227
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,440
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking about?

228
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,950
你接下来的婚礼
Uh, your upcoming wedding.

229
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,120
为我感到高兴吗
You excited for me?

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,130
是的
I am.

231
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,860
我很好奇
I'm curious,

232
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,950
你们有机会讨论过罗伯的期待吗
have you had a chance to discuss Rob's expectations?

233
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,000
-期待  -你想要一份事业
- Expectations? - Well, you want a career.

234
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,370
有的男人不允许自己的妻子去工作
Some men don't allow their wives to work.

235
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,160
罗伯知道我想成为一个歌手
Oh, well, Rob knows I want to be a singer.

236
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,750
我们谈过很多的
We've talked about it a lot.

237
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,070
自从你怀孕后吗
Since you've become pregnant?

238
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,780
这个嘛
Well...

239
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,730
没有
no.

240
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,610
或许是时候该谈谈了
Might be time for a chat.

241
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,070
罗伯给我感觉
Rob strikes me as the kind of man

242
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,710
会比较喜欢妻子待在家里
who'd prefer his wife to stay home.

243
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,510
你说得好像你认识他似的
You talk like you know him.

244
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,220
我了解他这种类型的男人
Oh, I know his type.

245
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,580
有钱  成功
Rich, successful.

246
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,450
那种男人想要的是一个堂下妻
That kind of man wants his wife in the kitchen,

247
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,620
喂饱孩子  给他倒马提尼
feeding the kids and pouring his martini.

248
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,880
罗伯才不是那样
Rob's not like that.

249
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,200
你绝对确定吗
You absolutely sure?

250
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,850
他最好能接受
Well, he better be okay with it,

251
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,040
否则我们之间就有问题了
or we're gonna have a problem.

252
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,030
我也是这么想的
That's what I was thinking.

253
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,530
根据这个  我们要找203号套房
Okay, according to this, we're looking for Suite 203.

254
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
希拉
Sheila.

255
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,820
来了
Coming!

256
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,310
你没事吧
You okay?

257
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,610
没事  我只是  非常紧张
Yeah, man, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm really nervous.

258
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,750
我基本是看斯科塞斯的电影长大的
You know, I basically grew up on Scorsese movies.

259
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,160
兄弟  帮我个忙
Hey, buddy, do me a favor.

260
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,200
我希望我们在进去之前  你能调一下你的期望值
I want you to manage your expectations before we walk in here.

261
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,080
该死的  为什么  他是个混蛋吗
Shit. Why? Is he an asshole?

262
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,660
这么说吧  这不会是你期望的那场会议
Let's just say it isn't gonna be the meeting you were hoping for.

263
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,660
什么鬼
What the fuck?

264
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,840
你好  伊莱
Hello, Eli.

265
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,470
所以我从一开始就不会见到斯科塞斯吗
So I was never meeting Scorsese?

266
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,260
抱歉  你真的得仔细听听她要说的话
Sorry. You really need to hear her out.

267
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,960
为什么
Why?

268
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,830
这是什么狗屁干预行为吗
Is this some sort of bullshit intervention?

269
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,440
差不多吧
Something like that.

270
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,020
我去弄些咖啡
I'm gonna go get some coffee.

271
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,380
你想来一杯吗
You want a cup?

272
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,610
不用  好吧  好吧
No. Cool. Cool.

273
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,160
这太羞辱人了
Well, this is humiliating.

274
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,160
伊莱  那不是我的本意
Eli, that wasn't my intention.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
但我们需要谈谈  私下里谈
But we need to talk. Privately.

276
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,710
谈什么
About?

277
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,470
艾琳・塔巴切尼克
Irene Tabatchnick.

278
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,800
艾琳・塔巴切尼克是他妈谁啊
Who the hell's Irene Tabatchnick?

279
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,070
睡在我们床上的那个女人
The woman who's been sleeping in our bed.

280
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,820
你最好坐下来  仔细听听剩下的部分
You may want to sit down for the rest of this.

281
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,530
如果本奈特医生的妻子把这事传了出去
If Dr. Bennett's wife told people,

282
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,080
那就违反了医患保密协议
that is a violation of doctor-patient confidentiality.

283
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,830
我们可以吊销他的行医执照
We should have his license revoked.

284
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,360
我们想在这事上耗费多少精力啊
How much energy do we really want to devote to all this?

285
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,830
这是歧视  我们必须反击
This is discrimination. We have to fight back.

286
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,870
然后为我的性生活和我的疾病引来更多注意力吗
And draw more attention to my sex life and my disease?

287
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,250
你不觉得大家会同情你吗
You don't think people will be sympathetic?

288
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,570
恰恰相反
On the contrary.

289
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,520
我觉得情况在好起来前只会先糟糕透顶
I think the situation's going to get much worse before it gets better.

290
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,420
那我们就别老想着这事了
Well, we won't dwell on it.

291
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,020
你不如先好好泡个热水澡吧
Why don't you take a nice, long, hot bath?

292
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,120
你似乎很疲惫
You seem exhausted.

293
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,080
原来被共和党人避之不及
Turns out being shunned by Republicans

294
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,930
会让人心力交瘁
takes rather a lot out of a person.

295
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,690
娜奥米  我一直想联系你呢
Naomi, I've been trying to reach you.

296
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,760
汤米怎么样了
How's Tommy?

297
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,040
他没事
He's fine.

298
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,660
我给医院打了好多次电话
Well, I keep calling the hospital,

299
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,120
但似乎一直都打不通
but I can never seem to get through.

300
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
这包里装的是什么
What are in the bags?

301
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,030
礼物
Ah, presents.

302
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,530
送我的吗
For me?

303
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,900
不  是你送的
No, from you.

304
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,500
你送我的每一份礼物  我现在都还给你
Every gift you ever gave me, I'm returning them.

305
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,410
我不明白
I don't understand.

306
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,110
你在巴伐利亚给我买的可爱的小雕像
This lovely figurine you got me while you were in Bavaria.

307
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,960
我现在不想要了
I don't want it anymore.

308
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,990
什么鬼
What the hell?!

309
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,330
以及这个可爱的银制音乐盒
Or this sweet silver music box.

310
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,790
我也不需要这个了
I don't need that either.

311
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,220
你是疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

312
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,890
是的  因为我知道了你对我儿子做的事
I have, because I know what you did to my son.

313
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,450
你要说的就这么一句叹息吗
That's all you have to say?

314
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,260
我理解你的愤怒
I-I understand your anger,

315
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,790
但如果你能给我个机会解释...
but if you'll just give me a chance to explain...

316
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,110
我会的  不过要先等我
I will, just as soon as

317
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,790
把这可爱的水晶纸镇还给你
I return this darling crystal paperweight.

318
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,410
住手
Stop it!

319
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,450
你不能跑到这里来毁了我的家
You can't come in here and destroy my home.

320
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,770
为什么不能
Why not?

321
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,540
你已经毁了我的生活
You destroyed my life.

322
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,160
如果我们不能理智地谈谈这事
If we can't talk about this rationally,

323
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,440
我就报警
I will call the police.

324
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,330
尽管报吧  我要走了
Go ahead, I'm leaving.

325
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,850
我倒是想说以后在乡村俱乐部见
You know, I would say that I'll see you at the country club,

326
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,000
但是  你也知道...
but, you know...

327
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,680
是你干的
It was you.

328
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,290
让你被投出去了吗
Who got you voted out?

329
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,440
没错
Yes.

330
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,870
理事会一知道卡尔患上了致命的传染病
The board didn't need much persuading once they knew

331
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,800
不需要怎么劝就同意了
that Karl was spreading a deadly disease.

332
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,740
我们当着所有朋友的面  被无礼地赶出来了
We were unceremoniously ejected in front of all of our friends.

333
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,500
希望你这下满意了
I hope you're satisfied.

334
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,560
满意
Satisfied?

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
你勾引了我的孩子
You seduced my child.

336
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,820
你真以为只是把你赶出乡村俱乐部
Do you honestly think that I would be satisfied

337
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,640
我就会满意了吗
just getting you kicked out of a country club?

338
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,330
我才刚开始呢  贱人
I am just getting started, bitch.

339
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,620
在我彻底收手前  我会彻底毁掉你
And before I am done, I will burn you,

340
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,880
毁掉你的生意
your business,

341
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,870
把这装修得丑哭的狗屎窝夷为平地
and this poorly decorated shithole to the ground!

342
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,530
满意了吗
Satisfied?

343
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,530
这里发生了什么
What the hell happened here?

344
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
情况刚刚变得更糟了
Things just got worse.

345
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,420
抱歉打扰
Sorry to intrude.

346
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,030
不知道你能不能借我一杯糖
I was wondering if I could borrow a cup of sugar.

347
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,900
我在烤蛋糕  忘了检查食品柜里的材料了
I'm baking a cake, and I forgot to check my pantry.

348
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
你并不是真的需要一杯糖  对吧
You don't really need a cup of sugar, do you?

349
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,500
是的
No.

350
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,060
进来吧
Come on in.

351
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,270
我能问问发生了什么事吗
Can I ask what happened?

352
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,070
我们去了一家百货商店
We were at a department store,

353
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,030
那个销售人员认出了我
and the sales clerk recognized me.

354
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,440
原来他是比我低两届的高中学弟
It turns out that he'd gone to my high school two years after I did,

355
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,220
所以他认识很多我的老朋友
so he knew a lot of my old friends.

356
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,930
我们就聊了五分钟
We only spoke for five minutes.

357
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,180
我们回来以后
After we got back,

358
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,620
拉尔夫指责我试图勾引那个男人
Ralph accused me of trying to seduce the man.

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,970
就这原因吗
That's why?

360
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,210
他以为你在调情
He thought you were flirting?

361
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,370
他只要一嫉妒  就会打我
He gets jealous. He can't help it.

362
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,830
我不明白
I don't understand

363
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,680
你怎么受得了这种日子
how you can live like this.

364
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,330
你一定过得不开心
You can't possibly be happy.

365
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,770
我是不开心
I'm not.

366
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,630
那你为什么不离开他呢
So why don't you leave?

367
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,890
我也可以问你同样的问题
I could ask you the same question.

368
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,950
什么意思
What?

369
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,190
你丈夫难道没有在外偷腥吗
Isn't your husband cheating on you?

370
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,920
他确实有
He is.

371
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,790
我有预感你早就知道
I had a feeling you knew.

372
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,580
那你为什么不离开他呢
So why don't you leave him?

373
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,210
我的情况和你的完全不一样
It's an entirely different situation.

374
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,310
他这是在羞辱你
He's humiliating you.

375
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,370
那一定很不好受
That's got to hurt.

376
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,010
确实如此
It does.

377
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,870
你还会再次相信他吗
Will you ever trust him again?

378
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,970
不会了
No.

379
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,860
如果你离开罗伯
And if you did leave Rob,

380
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,810
他会企图杀你吗
would he try and kill you?

381
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,600
当然不会
Of course not.

382
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,470
我丈夫会的
Well, my husband would.

383
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,710
他喜欢拿床头柜抽屉里上了膛的枪威胁我
He likes to threaten me with a loaded gun he keeps in his bedside drawer.

384
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,820
所以我选择留下
So I stay.

385
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,010
而你的借口又是什么呢
What in God's name is your excuse?

386
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,350
我总是期望着奇迹会发生
I keep hoping for a miracle.

387
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,640
奢望终有一天一切都会改变
That one day everything will change.

388
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,010
我们俩应该做朋友
You and I should be friends.

389
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,580
我们有很多相似之处
We have a lot in common.

390
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,690
艾琳・塔巴切尼克来自俄亥俄州
Irene Tabatchnick is from Ohio.

391
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,570
到她十六岁时
By the time she was 16,

392
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,820
她已被三个寄养家庭赶出家门
she was thrown out of three foster homes.

393
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,250
前两次  艾琳因偷钱被抓了现行
The first two times, Irene had been caught stealing cash.

394
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,160
那又如何  她那时还小  不懂事
So what? She was young. She was a kid.

395
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,820
她第三次被寄养家庭赶出来
She was kicked out of her third home

396
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,150
是因为她的养母指责她试图勾引她的丈夫
because her foster mother accused her of trying to seduce her husband.

397
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,110
也许那女人不想承认是她丈夫图谋不轨
Maybe the woman was in denial about what her husband was up to.

398
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,210
真相已无从知晓
Oh, we'll never know.

399
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,370
一周后  那所房子被烧毁
A week later, that house burned down.

400
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,980
被烧毁
Burned down?

401
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,130
她的养父母都葬身火海  伊莱
Those foster parents died, Eli.

402
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,520
艾琳・塔巴切尼克也人间蒸发
And Irene Tabatchnick just disappeared.

403
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,050
你觉得她...
So, what, you think she...?

404
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,130
虽然我们没有任何证据
I mean, we can't prove anything,

405
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,180
但是俄亥俄警方一直在找她
but the cops in Ohio are dying to talk to her.

406
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,230
这...这真是太扯了
Th-This is just so stupid.

407
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,270
这真是...洁德不会...
This is-- There's no way that Jade...

408
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,720
她的真名叫艾琳
Her name is Irene.

409
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,660
管她叫什么
Whatever.

410
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,420
她爱我们
She loves us.

411
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,990
如果她爱你  她会不断给你可卡因吗
If she loved you, would she keep giving you cocaine?

412
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,690
顺便说一句  你的脸色差极了
You look terrible, by the way.

413
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,320
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

414
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,770
清醒点吧  伊莱
Come on, Eli.

415
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,270
她使你吸毒成瘾  好来利用你
She keeps you high so she can take advantage of you.

416
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,160
好让你继续允许她住在我们家
So that you let her live in our house,

417
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,830
好让你给她买新车
so that you buy her a new car.

418
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,010
你不必设套来跟我说这些  泰勒
You know, you didn't need to trick me to have this conversation, Taylor.

419
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,540
你打个电话不就完了
You could've just called.

420
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,870
我打给你了啊  不停地打
I did call. Every hour.

421
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,580
你在说什么  你从未打给我
What are you talking about? You never called me.

422
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,080
我很确定我打过
I most certainly did.

423
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,550
看  你看
Look. Look.

424
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,900
没有未接来电  也没有语音留言
No missed calls. No voice mails.

425
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,710
那个狡猾的婊子屏蔽了我的号码
That sneaky bitch blocked my number.

426
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,210
从我的手机上吗
On my phone?

427
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,860
她又不知道我的锁屏密码  怎么做到的
She couldn't do that without my pass code.

428
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,360
她知道你的锁屏密码
Well, she has your pass code.

429
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,040
她怎么会知道
How does she have that?

430
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,330
我告诉她的
I gave it to her.

431
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,250
这样你就可以卷走我的钱
So you could take away my money.

432
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,620
-以防你再拿去买毒品  -天呐
- To keep you from buying drugs. - Jesus.

433
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,360
你猜怎么着  也许她确实利用了我
You know what, maybe she does take advantage of me,

434
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,770
但至少她给了我自信
but at least she builds me up.

435
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,260
她不会让我感觉自己像个
She doesn't make me feel like a fuck-up

436
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,080
注定会一败涂地的废物
who's just destined to crash and burn.

437
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,300
我认为你会一败涂地的唯一原因
The only reason why I think you're gonna crash and burn,

438
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,360
伊莱  是因为你曾经那么干过
Eli, is because you've done it before.

439
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,570
你不知道我下班回家后
You have no idea what it feels like to come home from work

440
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,610
看到你倒在厨房地板上抽搐时我是什么感受
and then find you convulsing on the kitchen floor.

441
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,540
还得叫救护车  过了好久才来
And then to call the ambulance, which took forever.

442
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,440
我不会再那么做了  伊莱  我...
I'm not gonna do that again, Eli. I'm...

443
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,830
又没人求着你要那么做
No one is asking you to.

444
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,640
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need your help.

445
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,160
我的事业已经回春  我活得很好
I've got my career back. I'm fine.

446
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,280
这里唯一有毛病的人是你
The only one here with a problem is you.

447
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,120
你是个瘾君子  伊莱
You're an addict, Eli.

448
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,600
你得去戒毒所  你也心知肚明
You need to go to rehab, and you know it.

449
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,610
我只知道  泰勒
The only thing I know, Taylor,

450
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,370
我们之间已经没什么好谈的了
is that this conversation is over.

451
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,510
-伊莱  请不要走...  -别说了
- Eli, please stop... - Stop!

452
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,610
够了  让我走吧
Enough! Let me go.

453
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,980
-你很喜欢你的新皮球  对吗  -是的
- You like your new ball, don't you? - Yes.

454
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,090
晚餐后  我们要给莉迪亚姨妈写封感谢信
After dinner, we're going to write a thank you note to Aunt Lydia.

455
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,940
我不会写字
I don't know how to write.

456
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,830
我来写正文
I'll do the writing.

457
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,960
你可以在我们的名字旁边画一颗大大的爱心
You can draw a big heart right next to our names.

458
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,840
哎呀  你爸爸忘记把垃圾桶拿进来了

Come along, Emily.

461
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,010
你难道不想给爸爸看看你的新球吗
Don't you want to show your daddy your new ball?

462
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,770
想啊

463
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,890
你们好啊
Hey there.

464

你们怎么回来啦
What are you two doing home?

465
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,400
我以为你们一小时后才会到家
I didn't expect you back for another hour.

466
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,120
莉迪亚姨妈身体抱恙
Aunt Lydia wasn't feeling well.

467
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,330
我们不得不缩短拜访时间
We had to cut our visit short.

468
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,500
-小公主  你手里拿的是什么  -皮球
- Hey, princess, what do you got there? - A ball.

469
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,230
莉迪亚姨妈送我的生日礼物
Aunt Lydia gave it to me for my birthday.

470
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,320
她的生日已经过去两个月了
Her birthday was two months ago.

471
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,870
心存感激  重在心意
Be nice. It's the thought that counts.

472
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,660
我能去玩了吗
Can I go play?

473
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,080
当然了
Of course you can.

474
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,830
罗伯  你掉了颗扣子吗
Rob, did you lose a button?

475
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,440
我刚在地上捡到一颗
I just found one on the floor.

476
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,160
我猜是的  谢谢
I guess I did. Thanks.

477
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,790
-妈妈  -抱歉  宝贝
- Mama. - I'm sorry, honey.

478
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,210
去吧
Here you go.

479
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,260
我晚餐要做芝士通心粉
I'm making mac and cheese for dinner,

480
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,920
所以别玩太久  好吗
so don't be too long, okay?

481
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,320
亲爱的
Honey?

482
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,130
打电话叫医生
Someone call a doctor.

483
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,500
艾米莉
Emily?

484
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,950
艾米莉  宝贝醒醒  睁开眼
Emily, honey, wake up. Open your eyes.

485
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,780
睁开眼啊  宝贝
Open your eyes, honey.

486
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,630
睁开眼啊
Open your eyes.

487
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,800
求你醒醒
Please wake up.

488
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,730
求你了...求你了...
Please... Please...

489
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,390
什么情况
What the hell?

490
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,230
谁开的车
Who was driving this car?!

491
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,140
她  她  她不知道从哪出来的
Sh-She, uh, she-she came out of nowhere,

492
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,350
先生  我发誓  我试着停车...
mister, I swear. I tried to stop...

493
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,390
你没关门吗
You left the gate open?

494
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,360
-关了  我确定我关了  -你确定吗
- No. I'm sure I locked it. - You're sure?

495
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,060
那艾米莉是怎么出去的
Then how did Emily get out of the backyard?

496
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,610
门闩离地有六英尺高
The latch is six feet off the ground!

497
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,570
我不知道  也许我忘了
I don't know. Maybe I forgot.

498
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,010
你没锁门
You didn't lock the gate.

499
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,380
你没锁门
You didn't lock the gate,

500
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,300
你还让她出去玩
and you let her out to play.

501
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,530
我得做晚餐啊
I had to make dinner.

502
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,480
这不是借口
That's no excuse.

503
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,200
我们的宝贝死了
Our baby is dead.

504
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,280
对不起
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,590
我以为是锁了的
I thought it was locked.

506
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,470
艾米
Amy.

507
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,450
我刚接到娜奥米的电话  卡尔得艾滋病了吗
I just got a call from Naomi. Does Karl have AIDS?

508
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,190
你们怎么能瞒着我
How could you not tell me?

509
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,020
我们以为还有时间
Well, we thought we had time.

510
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,290
你也能看出来  我还很健康呢
I mean, as you can see, I'm not exactly at death's door.

511
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,530
他的医生是最好的  所以别担心了
He has all the best doctors, so don't worry.

512
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,870
卡尔绝对可以参加你婚礼的
Karl will absolutely be able to walk you down the aisle.

513
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,200
这个时候  我都不确定婚礼还要不要办了
At this point, I'm not even sure there will be a wedding.

514
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,780
什么
What?

515
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
娜奥米打电话给了我们所有的朋友
Naomi's called all of our friends

516
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,140
告诉他们卡尔病了
and told them Karl is sick.

517
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,930
大家都不准备来了
People have been canceling right and left.

518
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,040
天啊
Oh, Lord.

519
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,250
如果没人来  还结什么婚
And if nobody's coming, why bother?

520
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,460
真是抱歉  亲爱的  我们能帮什么忙吗
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling. Is there anything we can do?

521
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,830
这个嘛...
Well...

522
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,260
如果你不去的话我们也许还能挽回一下局面
we might be able to salvage this thing if you didn't come.

523
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,930
不去婚礼吗
To the wedding?

524
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,270
我理解
I understand.

525
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,020
没问题  我会待在家里
of course, I will stay home.

526
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

527
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,070
不行  卡尔必须去参加婚礼
No. Karl has to be at the wedding.

528
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,420
不然谁带你走红毯啊
Who's gonna walk you down the aisle?

529
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,490
你可以啊
You can do it.

530
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,880
我花六千美元买一条阿玛尼的礼服
I did not spend $6,000 on an Armani dress

531
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,700
-不是为了让它与人共行的  -好了  别吵
- just to give it a shared entrance. - Okay, let's not argue.

532
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,240
谢谢
Thank you.

533
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,000
我不介意
I don't mind.

534
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,710
不行
No!

535
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,790
我们是一家人
We are a family.

536
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,240
当坏事来临时我们应该互相支持
When bad things happen, we're supposed to support each other.

537
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,220
在我看来
The way I see it,

538
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,340
他不来参加就是在支持我
he is supporting me by staying away.

539
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,130
我要去给宾客们打电话告诉他们可以来了
I have to call my guests and tell them it's safe to come.

540
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,610
艾米  请三思啊
Amy, think of what you're doing.

541
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,560
你为了几个胆小的歧视者
You're choosing a few cowardly bigots

542
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,810
而放弃了养育你的人
over the man who raised you.

543
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
我是新娘
I'm the bride.

544
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,360
那是我的大喜日子  我希望能完美
It's my day, and I want it to be perfect.

545
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,840
如果卡尔致命的疾病
I am sorry if Karl's deadly illness

546
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,550
使你的婚礼失色不少  那么我很抱歉
is scraping some of the glitter off of your event,

547
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,860
但面对现实吧  这不会是你最后一场婚礼的
but let's face it, this won't be your last wedding.

548
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,370
-你够毒  -更重要的是
- Nice. - More importantly,

549
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,180
如果卡尔不去  我也不去
if Karl can't attend, I won't either.

550
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,690
-萨蒙妮  -行
- Oh, Simone. - Fine.

551
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
待在家吧  省得给我丢脸
Stay home. You'll save me some embarrassment.

552
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,590
大家议论的不只是卡尔
Karl's not the only one everybody's talking about.

553
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,930
我女儿是个怪物
My daughter is a monster.

554
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,050
她是新娘  两者没区别
Well, she's a bride. It's basically the same thing.

555
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,320
那么...会议怎么样
So... how'd the meeting go?

556
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,980
我想知道一切
I want to hear everything.

557
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,580
只能说斯科塞斯不会导演我的电影了
Well, let's just say that Scorsese's not gonna be directing my movie.

558
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,690
不会吧
Oh, no.

559
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,120
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

560
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,340
但至少他喜欢这个剧本  对吧
But at least he loved the script, right?

561
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,260
-是的  是的  -很好
- He did. Yeah. - Good.

562
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,060
对  对  他特别喜欢
Yeah. Yeah, he especially liked the part

563
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,470
伊娃烧掉毒贩房子的那部分
where Eva burns the drug dealer's house down.

564
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,600
他喜欢那部分呀
He liked that?

565
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,330
对
Yeah.

566
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,690
对  他可喜欢了  他还问我是怎么想出来的
Yeah, he liked it so much, he asked me how I came up with it,

567
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,890
然后你懂的  我当然得告诉他那是你的点子
and, you know, of course I had to tell him it was your idea.

568
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,540
你不必给我功劳的
You didn't have to give me credit.

569
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,470
这个...
Yeah, well...

570
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,870
顺便问一下你是怎么想出来的
How did you come up with that, by the way?

571
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,290
就这么想出来的
Uh, it just came to me.

572
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,040
就突然想出来的吗
Just out of the blue?

573
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,100
对
Yeah.

574
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,790
因为这想法太不寻常了  你知道吗
'Cause it-it's such an unusual concept, you know,

575
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,260
以纵火来报复
arson as a form of revenge.

576
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,010
你也不知道你是怎么想出来的
You have no idea how that came to you?

577
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,750
这有什么重要的
Why does it matter?

578
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,760
我  我只是好奇
I-I'm-I'm just curious.

579
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,330
我不知道  就突然想到的
I don't know-- it just popped into my head.

580
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,820
就嘣的一下
Just, boop?

581
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,020
嘣的一下  没错
Boop. Yeah.

582
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,620
有时候就是这样
Sometimes that happens.

583
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,220
洁德这个名字也是这么来的吗
Is that how you came up with the name Jade?

584
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,790
就突然想到的吗
It just popped into your head?

585
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,870
什么
What?

586
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,830
我承认  这名字比艾琳更适合你
It suits you better than Irene, I'll give you that.

587
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,090
你最近跟谁说话了
Who have you been talking to?

588
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,500
看路
Hey, watch the road.

589
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,470
伊莱  别逗我
Eli, do not fuck with me.

590
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,090
不然要怎么样  烧掉我房子吗
Or else what, you're gonna burn down my house?

591
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,950
你跟杜克谈过了
You talked to Duke?

592
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,560
天呐  你干了那些事
Oh, my God. You did those things.

593
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,650
干了什么  他说了我什么
Did what? What did he say about me?

594
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,090
我的天  你杀了那些人  我的天
Oh, my God, you killed those people. Oh, my God.

595
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,520
伊莱  那人是骗子
Eli, Eli, the man is a liar!

596
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,620
-慢点  慢点  -伊莱  他说的一个字
- All right, slow down, slow down. - Eli, you can't believe

597
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,150
-你都不能信  -老天  看着点
- a fucking word he says! - Jesus, watch out!

598
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,370
卡尔  已经11点过了
Karl, it's after 11:00.

599
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,090
你什么时候去画廊
When are you going to the gallery?

600
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,780
当人们不再认为
When people stop assuming

601
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,460
可以通过石版画感染上艾滋的时候
you can catch AIDS from a lithograph.

602
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,660
他们全都可以去死了
Oh, screw them all.

603
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,120
我们要去亨廷顿吃午餐吗
Shall we have lunch at the Huntington?

604
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,460
-你请客的话  -很好
- Well, if you're paying. - Good.

605
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,040
我不想再一下午都盯着这些墙了
I can't spend another afternoon staring at these walls.

606
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,290
我也是
Oh, I can't either.

607
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,630
我们当初是怎么想的  全弄成了紫色
What were we thinking with all the damn purple?

608
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,750
-是我的幻觉还是  -不
- Is it just my imagination or...? - No.

609
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,970
不  他们在盯着我们
No. They're staring at us.

610
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,660
我们又做了什么
What have we done now?

611
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,830
{\an8}去死吧  艾滋病基佬

612
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,630
我的天
Oh, my God.

613
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,440
{\an8}去死吧  艾滋病基佬

614
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,290
什么
Wha...

615
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,540
有人看到是谁喷的吗
Did anyone see who did this?

616
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,480
肯定有人看到了
Someone had to have seen something.

617
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,070
别呆呆地看着  回答我
Don't just gawk. Answer me!

618
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,000
-萨蒙妮  -卡尔

619
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,290
我有点晕  我得回屋躺下
I'm-I'm a little dizzy. I just need to go inside and lie down.

620
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,870
你得去看医生  你能走到车上去吗
You need to see a doctor. Can you make it to the car?

621
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,840
有人能帮帮我们吗
Can someone please help us?

622
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,450
拜托帮我扶他上车
Please help us to the car!

623
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,590
得艾滋的人是他吗
Is he the one with AIDS?

624
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,300
谁在乎  他是人啊
Who cares? He's a human being!

625
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,010
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

我想雇你来我们家工作
I want to hire you to work on our property.

629

630
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,620
当然  非常感谢
Oh, of course. Um, thank you very much, uh...

631
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,240
-胡里奥  -对

632
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,240
胡里奥  上去吧
Julio. Here you go.

633
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,790
该死  该死
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

634
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,590
我得走了
I have to go.

635
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,400
什么
What?

636
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,070
天  我好想你
God, I missed you.

637
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,660
我想念和你做爱
I missed this.

638
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,370
我也是
Mmm, me, too.

639
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,530
我度过了有趣的一天
So, I had an interesting day.

640
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,680
是吗
Yeah?

641
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,740
我跟波特先生谈了  夜店的老板
I talked to Mr. Porter, that fella who runs the nightclub,

642
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,450
我跟他说了怀孕的事
I told him about the baby.

643
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,710
他说了什么
What did he have to say?

644
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,010
他祝贺了我
Well, he said congratulations.

645
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,470
他还说  一旦我生下孩子后
He also said, once I have the baby,

646
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,740
他希望我能立刻回去表演
he wants me right back up on that stage.

647
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,030
是不是很棒
Isn't that terrific?

648
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,920
是的
Yeah.

649
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,440
我就知道你会这么想
I knew you would think so.

650
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,690
可现在谈这个是不是过早了点
But isn't it a little early to talk about this?

651
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,200
先等孩子生下来再做决定吧
Why don't we see how you feel after the baby arrives?

652
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,610
我的感觉不会变
I won't feel any different.

653
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,110
照顾孩子很辛苦的
Well, taking care of a baby is hard work.

654
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,410
你也许会太累无法继续唱歌
You might be too tired to keep singing.

655
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,560
唱歌我永远不会累
I'll never be too tired to sing.

656
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,150
到时看吧
We'll see.

657
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,290
罗伯
Rob...

658
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,110
这是我的梦想
It's my dream.

659
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,540
梦想很棒
And dreams are great,

660
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,500
但你也要现实点
but you have to be realistic.

661
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,330
唱歌那行不是那么容易混的
It's a tough business to break into.

662
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,590
我知道
I know.

663
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,640
我家贝丝・安当初也想进入演艺界
My Beth Ann wanted to be in show business,

664
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,050
她最后终于想明白  放弃了
and she finally came to her senses and gave it up.

665
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,880
谢天谢地
Thank God.

666
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,030
也许我比她更有天赋
Well, maybe I'm more talented than she is.

667
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,430
她其实很不错  她想弹钢琴
She wasn't half-bad. She wanted to play piano.

668
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,650
钢琴
Piano?

669
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,520
对  她想成为钢琴演奏家  太荒谬了
Yeah, she wanted to be a concert pianist, which is ridiculous.

670
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,170
不过你想做什么都行
But you do what you want.

671
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
只要我回家后桌上有热腾腾的饭菜
As long as dinner's on the table when I get home,

672
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,870
我又在乎什么呢
what do I care?

673
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,030
说来有趣
You know, it's kind of funny.

674
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,010
我朋友希拉也想当钢琴演奏家
Uh, my friend Sheila also wanted to be a concert pianist.

675
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,400
是吗  世界真小
Yeah? Small world.

676
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,690
我得走了
Well, I got to go.

677
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,050
今晚给你打电话
I'll call you tonight.

678
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,970
格罗夫夫人
Mrs. Grove?

679
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,970
请说
Yes?

680
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,020
根据初步检测
Based on the initial exam,

681
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,990
我们认为你丈夫可能是患上了杰氏肺囊虫肺炎
we think your husband probably has Pneumocystis pneumonia,

682
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,940
这病在免疫系统受损的人群中很常见
an infection common in men with suppressed immune systems.

683
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,790
有多严重
How serious is it?

684
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,910
大多数病人经过治疗可以康复
Most patients recover with treatment.

685
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,220
大多数  你是说有的不能吗
"Most"? Do you mean some don't?

686
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,670
我们还会做一些检测  然后可以知道更多
We're gonna run some tests, then we'll know more.

687
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,720
谢谢
Thank you.

688
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,930
娜奥米
Naomi.

689
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,600
-护士  放下手中的活  叫保安  -不用了
- Nurse, put that down and call security. - Don't bother.

690
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,320
我就说一件事  然后就走
I just have one thing to say and then I'll go.

691
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,660
如果你觉得我会让你靠近我孩子
If you think I'm gonna let you go anywhere near my child...

692
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,170
我不是来找汤米的  我是来道歉的
I'm not here for Tommy. I'm here to apologize.

693
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,740
道歉  现在
An apology? Now?

694
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,490
-当我没兴趣吧  -那就告诉我
- Color me disinterested. - Then just tell me

695
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,850
我得做什么才能让你放过卡尔
what I have to do to get you to leave Karl alone.

696
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,540
我对他什么都没做
I haven't done anything to him.

697
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,690
你的蜚短流长使他成了过街老鼠
You have spread your poison and made him a pariah.

698
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,730
他失去了朋友
He has lost friends,

699
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,580
被女儿的婚礼拒之门外
been banned from his daughter's wedding,

700
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,590
他的家被糟蹋
had his home vandalized.

701
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,330
天呐  他病了  他不该沦落到
God, he's sick. He does not deserve

702
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,380
在丑闻和耻辱中等死
to spend his last days hounded by scandal and shame.

703
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,510
或许如此  但如果卡尔被无辜牵连
Maybe he doesn't, but if Karl's caught in the crossfire,

704
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,600
那也是因为他离你太近了
it's only because he's been standing too close to you.

705
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,870
娜奥米  我求你了
Naomi, I am begging.

706
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,750
责怪我  毁灭我
Blame me, destroy me.

707
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,290
我保证不会还手
I promise I won't fight back.

708
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,330
但求你别把卡尔扯进来
But please leave Karl out of it.

709
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,370
妈
Mom.

710
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,570
你干了什么好事
What have you done?

711
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,620
伊莱
Eli.

712
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,200
你是他妻子吗
Are you his wife?

713
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,150
是的
Yeah.

714
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,290
他没事吧  为什么昏迷了
Is he okay? Why-- why is he unconscious?

715
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,660
我们必须给他用镇静剂
He needed to be sedated.

716
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,740
他的肋骨骨折了  不过会康复的
His ribs are fractured, but he'll recover.

717
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,010
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

718
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,750
我们给他注射前  他说想见你
Before we put him out, he was asking for you.

719
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,610
我们告诉他你马上就来
We told him you were on your way.

720
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,540
我尽快赶来了
I came as fast as I could.

721
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,640
他给你写了留言
He wrote you this note.

722
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,410
说这很重要
Said it was important.

723
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,080
{\an8}戒毒

724
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,850
一切都还好吗
Everything okay?

725
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,030
嗯  都会好起来的
Yeah. I think it will be.

726
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,960
他要过一阵子才能醒过来
It's gonna be a while before he wakes up.

727
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,870
我会守在他身边等他醒来
Well, I'm gonna be here when he does.

728
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,600
斯坦顿夫人
Mrs. Stanton.

729
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,520
你好  克莱尔
Hello, Claire.

730
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,290
我有事找罗伯
I need to speak to Rob.

731
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,580
他不在
He's not here.

732
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,340
他什么时候才回来
How long until he returns?

733
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,980
我不确定
I'm not sure.

734
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,700
你要去旅行吗
Are you going on a trip?

735
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,910
我要回堪萨斯州的老家
I'm going back home to Kansas.

736
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,380
-去探亲吗  -不是
- For a visit? - No.

737
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,250
我要离开罗伯
I'm leaving Rob.

738
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,250
他有外遇了
He's been having an affair.

739
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,090
他不知道我知道了
He doesn't know I know,

740
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,190
所以我想我应该亲自告诉他
and I thought I should tell him in person.

741
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,120
斯坦顿夫人  我很遗憾
Oh, Mrs. Stanton, I'm so sorry.

742
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,860
谢谢
Thank you.

743
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,160
你知道他可能在哪里吗
Do you have any idea where he might be?

744
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,660
他在她的公寓
He's at her apartment.

745
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,160
这么说你早就知道
So you've known about this.

746
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,720
你要是早告诉我就好了
I wish you had told me.

747
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,660
我还以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends.

748
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,750
我没做过你的朋友
I haven't been your friend,

749
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,110
一秒钟都没做过
not for one second.

750
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,350
而你应该恨我
And you should hate me

751
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,380
因为我对你所做的一切
for everything I've done to you.

752
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,850
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

753
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,020
罗伯已经背着你出轨很多年了
Rob's been cheating on you for years...

754
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,010
有过各种各样的女人
with all sorts of women.

755
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,910
我就是其中之一
And I was one of them.

756
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,250
我是在保护你
I was protecting you.

757
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,330
通过毁掉他们的生活吗
By destroying their lives?

758
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,660
她占了你的便宜
She took advantage of you.

759
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,500
不  是我追求了她
No. I pursued her.

760
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,870
而且我们的感情是真爱
And what we had, it was real.

761
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,700
你这么想是因为她扭曲了你的思想
You only think that because she twisted your mind.

762
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,480
相信我  没有她你会过得更好
Trust me, you are better off without her.

763
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,290
不  也许没有你我会过得更好
No, maybe I'd be better off without you.

764
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,420
汤米
Tommy...

765
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,230
爸总是说你报复心很重
Dad always said that you were vindictive,

766
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,390
我一有机会就应该离开你
and I should get away from you as soon as I got the chance.

767
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,530
你爸是个可悲的酒鬼
Your dad was a pathetic drunk.

768
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,930
但他清楚你的底细
But he had your number.

769
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,330
我今晚就走
I'm leaving tonight.

770
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,160
明天早上乘第一班飞机去欧洲
And I'll be on the first plane to Europe in the morning.

771
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,700
你以为我会出钱让你去欧洲游荡吗
Well, you think I'm just gonna pay for you to go traipsing around Europe?

772
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,850
我18岁了  可以动用我的信托基金
I'm 18. I have access to my trust fund.

773
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,870
我不需要你的任何东西
I don't need anything from you.

774
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,870
但我还是你妈妈
I am still your mother.

775
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,610
不  从现在起  你只是我曾认识的一个女人
No, from now on, you're just some lady that I used to know.

776
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,810
{\an8}二号楼梯
医院入口

777
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,620
你要开走吗
You pulling out?

778
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,850
先不走
Not yet.

779
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,950
我在等人
I'm waiting for someone.

780
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,040
你一定要理解  多年来我一直
You have to understand, I have wanted to tell you

781
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,490
想告诉你  但是...
for years, but...

782
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,550
天呐  我真羞愧
Oh, God, I am so ashamed.

783
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,560
我要离开他了  克莱尔
I'm leaving him, Claire.

784
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,620
已经无所谓了
It doesn't matter anymore.

785
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,540
等我把剩下的话说完  你就不会这么想了
You won't feel that way once I've told you the rest.

786
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,410
还有别的要说的
There's something else?

787
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
我最后一次和你丈夫上床
The last time I slept with your husband...

788
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,790
是在你孩子死的那天
was the day your child died.

789
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,570
当时我们在你们以前的房子的卧室里
We were in your bedroom at your old house...

790
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,090
罗伯听到了关车门的声音
when Rob heard a car door slam.

791
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,550
他起床看到你和你女儿
He got up to see you and your daughter

792
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,790
提前回家了
had come home early.

793
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,110
他吆喝我赶紧穿衣服
He yelled at me to get dressed.

794
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,290
你开始往后院拖垃圾桶
You began dragging a trash can to the backyard,

795
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,310
所以我们有时间跑到楼下
so we had time to run downstairs.

796
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
我本来想躲在壁橱里
I was going to hide in a closet,

797
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,200
但罗伯说太冒险了
but Rob said it was too dangerous.

798
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,370
他让我从房子侧门出去
So he told me to get out through the side of the house.

799
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,520
你们从前门进来的时候
So while you were coming in the front door...

800
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,110
你们好啊
Hey there.

801
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,960
我绕着房子跑出去
I ran around the side of the house...

802
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,050
从后院的大门离开了
and left through the gate.

803
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,930
我没关门
And I left it open.

804
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,450
几小时后  一个同事打来电话
A few hours later, someone from work called.

805
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,490
他们告诉我发生了什么
They told me what had happened,

806
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,250
我瞬间就知道是我的错
and I instantly knew it was my fault.

807
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,410
斯坦顿夫人
Oh, Mrs. Stanton,

808
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,680
我不知该如何表达我有多抱歉
I can't even begin to tell you how sorry I am.

809
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,330
我有一个问题
I have one question.

810
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,090
什么
What's that?

811
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,360
罗伯知道你没有关门吗
Did Rob know you had not closed the gate?

812
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,890
我那晚跟他打了电话  告诉了他
I called him that night and I told him.

813
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,000
他说他可以原谅我
And he said he could forgive me...

814
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,900
如果我不告诉任何人发生了什么
if I never told anyone else what had happened.

815
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,490
于是我没有说出去
And I didn't.

816
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,090
我很惭愧
I was so ashamed.

817
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,660
我知道你不能原谅我的所作所为
I know you can't forgive me for what I've done,

818
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,600
但我愿意下半辈子
but I will spend the rest of my life

819
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,480
都用来弥补我的过错
trying to atone for what I did to you.

820
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,350
起来
Get up.

821
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,290
你做了  一件很可怕的事  克莱尔
You did... a horrible thing, Claire.

822
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,490
但我会原谅你
But I'll forgive you

823
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,750
如果你答应为我做一件事
if you promise to do one thing for me.

824
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,170
任何事都行
Anything.

825
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,250
你不能告诉任何人
You will never tell another living soul

826
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,740
我们有过这次对话
that we had this conversation.

827
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,730
什么
What?

828
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,230
罗伯不能知道
Rob can't know.

829
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,800
我决定不离开他了
I've decided not to leave him.

830
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,950
我不明白
I don't understand.

831
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,550
你不需要
You don't have to.

832
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,790
你只需要许下庄严誓约
All you need to do is give me your solemn vow.

833
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,160
做到后  我就原谅你
Do that and you have my forgiveness.

834
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,090
好
Okay.

835
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,160
我答应你
I promise.

836
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,140
谢谢你  克莱尔
Thank you, Claire.

837
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,870
乖乖
Hey, girl,

838
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,160
你怎么来了
what are you doing here?

839
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,910
它想你了
She missed you.

840
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,580
洁德
Jade.

841
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,290
希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind.

842
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,810
我自己进来的  你的锁坏了
I let myself in. Your lock's busted.

843
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,600
为什么我觉得是你弄坏的
Why do I get the feeling that you busted it?

844
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,920
别生气  我想见你
Don't be mad. I wanted to see you.

845
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,400
好打断我另一条腿吗
Why, so you could break my other leg?

846
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,450
天  我很抱歉
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about that.

847
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,340
上次局势有点失控
Things got a little crazy last time,

848
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,120
但我想补偿你
but I'm trying to make it up to you.

849
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,950
你打扫了房间
See you cleaned a little bit.

850
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,170
有点像猪圈  不是我挑剔
It was kind of a pigsty. Not that I'm being critical.

851
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,460
我知道你最近
I know you've been busy with, um,

852
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,920
在监狱里
jail and stuff.

853
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,560
-你在做饭  -是的  锅烤肉
- And you're cooking? - Yeah, pot roast.

854
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,920
用的你喜欢的那个食谱
The recipe you like.

855
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,750
你怎么不给你豪宅里的
Why aren't you cooking for your rich friends

856
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,610
富人朋友做
in their fancy mansion?

857
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,200
他们把你赶出来了吗
Did they kick you out?

858
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,360
伊莱知道了我的过去
Eli found out about my past,

859
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,130
所以我收拾了东西走了
so I packed up my stuff and I left.

860
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,890
真可惜
What a shame.

861
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,930
你跟他说了话吗
Did you talk to him?

862
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,120
你为什么会这么想
Now, why would you think that?

863
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,410
因为只有你知道我真名
Because you're the only one who knows my real name.

864
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,240
我对天发誓  我没有告诉伊莱
Hand to God, I did not tell Eli.

865
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,330
你告诉了其他人吗
Did you tell someone else?

866
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,160
泰勒来监狱看了我
Taylor came to see me in jail.

867
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,000
该死
Oh, shit!

868
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,950
她说如果我打你小报告
Yeah, she offered to pay my bail

869
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,450
她就愿意支付我的保释金
if I ratted you out, so...

870
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,010
泰勒是律师
Taylor is a lawyer!

871
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,400
她有人脉  警察仍然在找我
She knows people, and the cops are still looking for me.

872
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,870
我可能会进监狱的
I could end up in prison!

873
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:35,220
我也许还要拄一年的拐杖
Yeah, and I may be walking with a cane for a year,

874
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,370
我想我们扯平了
so I guess we're even.

875
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,410
我得离开这里  我需要钱
I got to get out of town. I need money.

876
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,530
-别看我  我身无分文  -你肯定有点什么
- Don't look at me, I'm busted. - Well, you must have something.

877
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,170
你爷爷的表呢
Like, what about your grandfather's watch?

878
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,410
-怎么了  -给我  我去当掉
- What about it? - Give it to me! I'll pawn it.

879
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,560
想得美
The hell you will!

880
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,910
该死  杜克  你欠我的
Goddamn it, Duke! You owe it to me!

881
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,110
你这次把我害惨了
You really fucked me this time!

882
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,330
我屁都不欠你  滚出我家
I don't owe you shit. Now get the fuck out of my house!

883
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,250
离我远点
You stay away from me.

884
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,610
又开始瞪眼了吗
Again with the crazy eyes, huh?

885
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,580
听着  宝贝  把刀放下
Look, baby, just put the knife down, okay?

886
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,190
把刀...
Just put the knife...

887
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,790
你要为此付出代价的
You're gonna pay for that.

888
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,420
你觉得吗
You think?

889
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,240
下午好  有什么需要帮助的
Afternoon. What can I do for you?

890
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,010
我要买把枪
I need to buy a gun.
