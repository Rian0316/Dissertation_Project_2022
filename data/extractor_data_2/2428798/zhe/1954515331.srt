这泡屎不是在你的看管下拉的吗
poo-poo didn't happen on your watch

44
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,999
然后你就干等到你时间到了 然后好让我去处理这问题

既然米奇爷爷在的话 他能不能...

53
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,380
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

54
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:09,883
我小时候我爸就从来没照顾过我
My dad was never there for me when I was a kid.

55

怎么啦 爸爸
What's wrong, Daddy?

爸爸要选匹小马来改变这悲催的命运呀 真心不好挑

00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,138
我们要找个保姆 我爸绝对干不了这个
We've got to find a nanny, and my dad's definitely not it.

63
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,141
嗯  如果你没法解决保姆问题
Well, um, and this doesn't solve your nanny problem,

64
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,327
你又很需要人看管孩子的话
but if you're in need of a babysitter,

65
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,612
我和尼克可以代劳
Nick and I could do it.

66
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:41,364
我们是超合拍的情侣 你懂的

呃  如果非要说哪对情侣超合拍的话

68
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,253
那必须是我和维多利亚
it's me and Victoria.

69
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,323
你不会真的认为你和维多利亚
Do you think that you and Victoria

70
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,542
比我和尼克更合拍吧
are clicking more than me and Nick?

71
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,427
你和尼克也算合拍吗
Do you think you and Nick are...

72
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,596
噢 真不容易
Oh, that's precious.

73
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,716
孩子们 当你处在一段新恋情中

74
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:02,252
并且还和你的前任比赛谁更幸福的话
and you're competing with your ex for who's happier,

75
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,503
这个过程真上不了台面
it can get ugly

76
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:06,273
随你怎么说 我要走了
Anyway, I should get going.

77

00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,728

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,446
嘿 也许帮我给维多利亚配钥匙的锁匠
Hey, maybe the locksmith who made the key

81
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,365
能帮上你这个忙呢
I gave to Victoria will give you a deal.

82
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,650
哦 对了 他可能不记得我了
Oh, wait, he won't remember me.

83
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,784
因为那是三周前的事了
It was three weeks ago.

84

87
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,199

我们都记得 一切都还那么美好

你知道为什么吗
And do you know why?

101
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,227
因为你是天堂派来的天使吗?

我好想投进你温暖的怀抱

是个岛吧
That's an island, right?

123
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,443
那得看你怎么想了
Depends where you're going with this.

124
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,046
在去夏威夷岛的路上
All the way to the island of Hawaii.

125
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:54,381
你想问为什么是吧
Why, you ask?

Well, I was invited

127

128
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,135
就在昨晚 我见尼克父母的时候

你是否...呃...
Have you, um,

131
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,724
见过维多利亚的父母呀 泰德同学
met Victoria's parents, Ted?

132
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,395
事实上 我没有
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

133
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,513
因为他们去世了
Because they're dead.

134
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,266
真的吗 泰德
Are they, Ted?

135
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:14,901
他们真的去世了吗
Are they really dead?

136
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:17,070
没有
No.

137
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,188
你大爷的

"十月闪炮节"就一大杯具
Bangtoberfest is a flop!

139
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:25,195
我想不出任何一种新的泡妞方式
I can't think of an innovative way to bang chicks

140
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:27,697
来使我荣耀回归
that properly honors my return to the game.

141
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,149
当然我也试了一些旧的稳妥方案
Sure, I've tried some old reliables.

142
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:31,835
十张未付停车罚单么
Ten unpaid parking tickets?

143
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:37,507
我想只有一条路可以让你摆"脱"了
I suppose there is one way I could... "Get you off."

144
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:40,927
不是这样的
No!

145
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:44,330
这个神句都用了好几千遍了
I've used that admittedly awesome line a thousand times.

146
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,349
你该更强些啊 巴尼君
You're better than this, Barney!

147
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,469
怎么说呢 现有的证据对你不太有利
Well, the evidence is pretty incriminating, but...

148
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:54,107
但我有一个办法能让你摆"脱"
I suppose there is one way I could "Get you off."

149
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,976
我妹的 我在干嘛
Damn it! What?

150
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:59,229
十月闪炮节是一种创新
Bangtoberfest is about innovation,

151
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,947
观念上的创新
about ideas.

152
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,516
它曾有着深远的意义
Bangtoberfest used to mean something.

153
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,851
这不是你昨天刚编出来的么
You just made it up yesterday.

154
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:05,952
问够了没
Enough questions.

155
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,037
我得去好好想想
I need time to think!

156
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,958
保姆找的怎么样了 莉莉
So, how's the nanny search going, Lil?

157
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,159
垃圾
Lousy.

158
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,062
巴克敏斯特太太是如此和蔼可亲
Mrs. Buckminster was a spoonful of sugar.

159
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,932
但目前 我们在"嘿保姆保姆"网站上唯一能雇得起的
But so far, everyone we can afford on this Web site

160
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:22,852
只有仙女保姆 斯卡利・波平斯了
HeyNannyNanny.com is Scary Poppins.

161
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,771
可莉莉和马修真很需要一位保姆
<i>But Lily and Marshall needed a nanny,</i>

162
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:27,140
所以他们继续埋头苦寻
so they forged ahead with their search.

163
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:29,709
这么说 你没做过保姆
So, zero experience as a nanny?

164
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,879
嗯啊 不过我在戒毒期间负责照看小猫
Right. But in rehab, I was in charge of the cats.

165
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,665
也就只死掉了两只嘛 所以我想
And only two died, so I figured...

166
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,800
我有空哟
I'm available.

167
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,236
你如何看待体罚
How do you feel about spanking?

168
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:44,040
一小时八块钱 你想对我做什么就做什么
For eight bucks an hour, you can do whatever you want to me.

169
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,325
我有空哟
I'm available.

170
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,693
爸 我们知道了
Dad, we know.

171
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:49,245
我没在跟你讲话
I wasn't talking to you.

172
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,115
最后 他们遇见了朱莉・约格森
Finally, they met Julie Jorgensen.

173
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,568
你是明尼苏达州圣克劳德镇的
You're from St. Cloud, Minnesota?

174
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,786
我也是圣克劳德人
I'm from St. Cloud.

175
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,172
真的 喔 那你肯定知道我爸爸 乔治・约格森
Really? Oh, you must know my dad, George Jorgensen?

176
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,173
当然知道
Of course.

177
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,407
乔治・约格森风琴公司
George Jorgensen's Organs.

178
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,909
去年 我哥哥也加入了公司
Last year, my brother joined the business.

179
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,462
哎呀 谁能想到摩根・约格森也开始造风琴了
Really? Who knew that Morgan Jorgensen would go into organs?

180
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,579
这样的话 我问你朱莉
Anyway, Julie...

181
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,264
你爸爸那儿还叫乔治・约格森风琴公司
Is it still called George Jorgensen's Organs

182
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,767
还是把名字改成乔治・约格森和儿子风琴公司
or did they change it to George Jorgensen and Son Organs?

183
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,386
他们把名字改成乔治和摩根・约格森风琴公司
They changed it to George and Morgan Jorgensen's Organs.

184
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,921
猜猜那是谁的主意
Guess whose idea that was?

185
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,856
-摩根的呗*2
-Morgan's. -Morgan's.

186
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,424
他们刚在州外开了一家新店
They just opened a new shop out of state.

187
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:19,809
-嗯 在哪儿        -俄勒冈州
-Oh, yeah? Where? -Oregon.

188
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,693
那家店叫什么名字
What's that one called?

189
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,495
钢琴城
Piano Town.

190
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:25,448
你看 你有工作经验
Well, you have experience,

191
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,618
而且我敢说我老公很乐意请你工作
and I think it's safe to say you have my husband's approval.

192
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,153
你要多少薪水
What's your salary?

193
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,988
喔 就在这儿
Oh, um, it's right there.

194
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,609
朱莉 我们很乐意请你给我们的孩子当保姆
Julie, we would love for you to be our nanny.

195
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,161
好啊 多谢
Oh, thank you so much.

196
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,279
呃 我今天还有一个面试
Um, I just have one last interview today,

197
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,948
说真的 我觉得我可能遇不到
but to be honest,I can't imagine

198
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,716
比你们更好的人了
liking anyone more than I like you guys.

199
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,134
喔
Oh...

200
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:46,169
好滴 拜拜
Okay, bye.

201
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,170
拜拜
Bye.

202
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,788
太好啦
Yay.

203
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,392
切 丫就一贱货
Well, she was a total bitch.

204
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,179
那天晚上 莉莉和马修给朱莉打电话
That night, Lily and Marshall called Julie

205
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,897
希望她能接受这份工作
hoping she'd accept the job.

206
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,149
十分抱歉 我不能做了
I'm so sorry, I can't.

207
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,769
别说你又另找到一份保姆工作
Don't tell us you took the other job.

208
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,971
不 我没有 我没有做保姆
No, I didn't. I'm not taking any nanny job.

209
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,990
我不明白
I don't understand.

210
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,107
在跟你们面试之后
The most amazing thing happened

211
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,976
发生了一件超棒的事
at my next interview after you guys.

212
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,911
我爱上了一位单身父亲
I fell in love with a single dad

213
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,947
而他是个亿万富翁
who turns out to be a billionaire.

214
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,783
明天 我们就要坐他的私人飞机飞巴黎
Tomorrow, we're heading off to Paris in his private jet.

215
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:20,670
就像他说的，这一切即将成为传--静候
It's gonna be, as he would say, legend-- wait for it...

216
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,339
巴尼
Barney!

217
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:26,659
要-不 说我的 实-真 名-姓
Ix-nay on the eal-ray ame-nay.

218
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,177
埃里克森夫妇
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen?

219
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,681
你个...
You son of a...

220
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,349
球儿-混
itch-bay!

221
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:41,166
你看 不知道为啥 巴尼是我们的朋友
Look, Barney's our friend, for some reason,

222
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,650
告诉你 他说的一切都是谎话
and everything he told you was a lie.

223
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,235
可好消息是
But the good news is

224
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,270
你还可以来给我们工作嘛
you're free to come work for us.

225
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,489
抱歉 我绝不会给和那个怪物
I'm sorry, I can't nanny for anyone

226
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,658
是朋友的人做保姆
who's friends with this monster.

227
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,049
你看 我还想跟你们坐下来喝点咖啡
Look, I'd offer you guys coffee,

228
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,567
但十五分钟后
but I have another nanny interview

229
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,919
还有另一个保姆过来面试 所以 
in about 15 minutes, so...

230
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,221
就一个问题 巴尼 你为嘛要面试保姆
Barney, quick question: why are you interviewing nannies?

231
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,306
多亏你问了
Glad you asked!

232
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,291
你们几个总是逼着我想出
You guys were all pressuring me to think of

233
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,677
一种革命性方式来庆祝十月闪炮节
a revolutionary new way to get chicks for Bangtoberfest.

234
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,795
说真的 我那时真没头绪
And frankly, I was stumped.

235
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,230
直到...
Until...

236
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,766
但目前 我们在"嘿保姆保姆"网站上唯一能雇得起的
So far, everyone we can afford on this Web site

237
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:20,103
只有仙女保姆斯卡利・波平斯了
HeyNannyNanny.com is Scary Poppins.

238
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,804
突然灵光乍现
<i>And there it was.</i>

239
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:25,275
天上的老大哥回应了我的祈祷
<i>The Big Bro in the sky had answered my prayers.</i>

240
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:26,976
万能的上帝之击掌
Almighty-five.

241
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,161
嗷
Ow.

242
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,313
我给你们介绍下小宝宝埃德加
I'd introduce you to little Baby Edgar,

243
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,832
有一点 他还在睡觉呢
but one, he's napping,

244
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:36,202
还有一点 他根本就不存在
and two, he doesn't exist.

245
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:39,005
那些保姆们还真相信你了
And these nannies are really falling for this?

246
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,008
也是啊 这些玩具根本就不是婴儿玩的
Yeah, these toys don't even make sense for a baby.

247
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,095
这儿是把气枪 那是我小时候曾经玩过的
You've got an air rifle, you got the exact race track

248
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,147
双环四驱车赛道 哇 
with the double loopty-loop I had as a kid!

249
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,884
我能拆开吗 我能拆开吗 我能拆开吗
Oh, can I open it, can I open it, can I open it?

250
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,802
那埃德加的妈妈去哪儿了
What about Baby Edgar's mom?

251
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:56,022
噢 那可是个令人伤心的故事
Oh, that's a sad story.

252
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,175
但到最后 验尸官的报告证实了
And in the end, the coroner's report confirmed

253
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,977
我所害怕的一点
what I already feared:

254
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:06,533
女性的身体不能承受那么多连续的高潮
the female body cannot withstand that many consecutive orgasms.

255
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,054
我一直都在责备我自己
I blame myself.

256
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,873
好吧 谁有6节9伏的电池
Okay, does anybody have six nine-volt batteries?

257
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,629
每次我得到这些保姆的同情
Once I got the nannies all sympathetic,

258
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:22,215
我就要查查她的资历
I had to check their qualifications.

259
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,234
我想看看你怎么处理婴儿洗澡的问题
I'd like to see how you handle bath time.

260
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,686
跟着我来浴缸吧
Follow me to the tub.

261
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,054
我应该带着孩子过来吗
Should I get the baby?

262
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,206
不
No.

263
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,225
我就是想把这些电池
I'm just gonna take the batteries

264
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,544
从烟雾报警器里拿出来 行吗 好的
out of these smoke detectors. Cool? Cool.

265
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:40,433
每次我面试完 我就要使出杀手锏
Once the interview was over, I went in for the kill.

266
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,352
你很适合这份工作
You're perfect for the job.

267
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,854
所以 恭喜你 你被雇...
So, congratulations, you're hi...

268
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,022
不
No.

269
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,741
我不能这么做
I can't do this.

270
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,393
我觉得你很吸引人
I find you very attractive,

271
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,579
我这么做不是很合适
and it wouldn't be appropriate.

272
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,034
我这么做不是很合适
It wouldn't be appropriate.

273
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,757
我这么做不是很合适
It wouldn't be appropriate.

274
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,129
我是说 我这么做不是很合适
I repeat-- it would not be appropriate.

275
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,137
就像是从一个虚构出来的小孩那儿抢糖吃一样
It was like taking candy from an imaginary baby!

276
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,606
巴尼 有五个月都没人帮我了
Barney, I just went five months with no help,

277
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:22,942
在遇到我们喜欢的那个妞之前 我们还面试了92个保姆
and interviewed 92 nannies before finding one we liked,

278
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,360
你在我得回去工作的前一晚
and you ruined everything

279
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,030
把一切都毁了
the night before I'm supposed to go back to work?

280
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:29,866
真心谢谢你 你是我见过的
Thank you for being the most immature person

281
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,284
最不成熟的人
I have ever met.

282
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,485
马修 我们走
Marshall, let's go.

283
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:33,503
再玩五分钟
Five more minutes!

284
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:36,072
现在就走
Now.

285
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,807
我很快就回来
I'll be right back. Okay.

286
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,836
我会想你的
I'll miss you.

287
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,973
哦 
Oh! Oh!

288
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,494
太作了吧 
Overcompensating a bit?

289
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,513
我哪里做作了啊
Why would I need to overcompensate?

290
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,432
我...
I am...

291
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,301
在这段完美的恋情中是非常幸福的
...deliriously happy in my perfect relationship.

292
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,405
那我在两分钟前看到的怎么说
What about what I just witnessed not two minutes ago?

293
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:12,492
巨人队怎么能以3:1给超了
How can the Giants pass on third and one?!

294
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,310
亲爱的 没事的
Honey, it's okay.

295
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,880
这才第一节 布朗队才拿了3分
It's the first quarter, and the Browns are only up by three...

296
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,832
罗宾 我不是想让你去解决问题
Robin, I don't want you to fix this.

297
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:23,503
我只是想要被倾听
I just want to feel heard.

298
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,455
首先 巨人队很聪明地
First of all, the Giants were smart

299
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,790
没有通过我的道格庞德的防守
not to run on my Dawg Pound defense.

300
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:28,825
-他们糟透了 泰德 -我知道
They suck, Ted. I know.

301
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,460
第二
And two--

302
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:33,229
你不可能喜欢和那家伙在一起
there is no way that you like being with a guy

303
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,631
他太感性又太缺爱
who's so emotional and needy.

304
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,883
你想挑事是吧 莫斯比
You want to dance, Mosby?

305
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,219
我们来说说昨天吧
Let's talk about yesterday.

306
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,605
嗨 你们好 对不起我回来太晚了
Hi! You guys, I'm so sorry I'm so late.

307
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:45,391
我会在5分钟之内 跑上楼 换衣服 
I'm gonna run upstairs, change, I'll be back

308
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:47,694
然后回来
in five minutes.

309
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,979
慢慢来 亲爱的
Take your time, sweetie.

310
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,384
维多利亚是个邋遢鬼
Victoria's a slob!

311
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,452
嗯 至少我没有和娘炮约会啊
Well, at least I'm not dating a girl.

312
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,187
你知道我什么意思
You know what I mean.

313
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,305
嘿 你知道吗
Hey, you know what?

314
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,491
我真的很喜欢他是这么的
I-I really appreciate how sensitive

315
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,494
细心和感性 还有他的...
and in touch he is with his...

316
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,028
天啊 我这不是搞笑么
God, who am I kidding?

317
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,866
我赌20刀 他在女厕所哭呢
20 bucks says he is crying in the ladies' room right now.

318
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:13,503
嗯 至少当他哭完 他还会冲一下厕所
Well, at least when he's finished, he's gonna flush.

319
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,591
正当莉莉准备在在返工的第一天
So, just as Lily was about to call in sick

320
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,426
打电话请病假的时候
on her first day back to work...

321
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,984
早上好
Good morning!

322
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:31,321
巴克敏斯特太太 抱抱我 什么都好说
Mrs. Buckminster, hold me and make everything okay!

323
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:35,108
我的意思是 额 你来干嘛
I mean, uh... what are you doing here?

324
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,562
一个叫斯丁森的先生给中介打电话给了我薪水
A Mr. Stinson called the agency and offered to pay my salary.

325
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,916
哇噢 真的
Wow. Really?

326
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:45,535
他这行为很不错 但我还是很生气
It's a nice gesture, but I'm still pissed.

327
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,070
他还让我捎来一份这个东西
He also sent along this.

328
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,006
电池呢
Are the batteries...?

329
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,176
电池早装上咯 亲
Yes, the batteries are included, dear.

330
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,378
太好了
Yes!

331
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,597
现在 你们俩 追求事业去吧
Now, off to work, you two.

332
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,516
小马尔文先生和我还要熟悉一下
Mr. Marvin and I are going to get acquainted.

333
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,135
好
Great.

334
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,937
我等不及把他放到你手里了
I can't wait to hand him off

335
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:05,638
然后 终于能解放了
and-and finally get some freedom.

336
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,141
你确实该解放了 来 递过来
You deserve it. Now hand him over.

337
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,027
递过去 好的
Hand him over, yup.

338
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,147
我这就把小马尔文从你手里接走
I'll just take little Marvin off your hands then.

339
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,115
从我手里接走
Take him off my hands.

340
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:18,151
来吧
There he goes.

341
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,954
准备好要接他了哟
Ready to receive him!

342
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,623
我不能把小马尔文送到一个陌生人手里
I can't give Marvin to a stranger!

343
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,079
好吧 没在比赛的人
Okay, somebody who's not in the middle of a race

344
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,632
得去和她谈谈
should probably go talk to her.

345
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,732
对不起 巴克敏斯特太太
I'm sorry Mrs. Buckminster

346
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,405
我们决定以后不找保姆了
we've decided we're not going to use a nanny afterall.

347
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,421
你被解雇了
You're fired.

348
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,813
淡定
Calm down.

349
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,091
莉莉 你只是因为要和小马尔文
Lily, you're just nervous about spending

350
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,864
分开一天而紧张
your first day away from Marvin.

351
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,609
这很正常
That's perfectly normal.

352
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,169
噢 我要永远抱着你
Oh, I am holding on to you forever.

353
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,937
哪怕我死了 变成骷髅了
And when I die and I become a skeleton

354
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,738
我依然会抱着你 么么 
I'll still be holding you. Yes.

355
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,915
昨晚 尼克因为我杀死了一只蜘蛛 哭了
Last night, Nick cried when I killed a spider.

356
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,902
你应该把那只蜘蛛带到我家
You should have brought that spider over to my house

357
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,808
这样可以喂我家的那群
to feast on the ant colony

358
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,961
被维多利亚没洗的盘子招来的蚂蚁
breeding on Victoria's unwashed dishes.

359
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,630
哇
Whoa!

360
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,015
巴尼 怎么了
Barney, what happened to you?

361
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:16,551
简直是梦魇啊
It was a nightmare.

362
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:18,670
我沿着街走 想着自己的事情
I'm walking down the street, minding my own business,

363
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,105
然后我看到一个我验过的保姆
and I see one of the nannies

364
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,006
然后我在想
that I interviewed, and I'm thinking,

365
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,192
也许我可以让她到垃圾箱后面
"Maybe I can get her behind a Dumpster

366
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,861
然后再验一次
and interview her again."

367
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,363
但是
But then...

368
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,983
然后
And then...

369
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:33,518
她们到处都是
They were everywhere.

370
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,238
我被包围了
I was surrounded!

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,989
-嘿 -嗨
Hey. Hi.

372
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,458
你丫
Did you

373
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,359
真的以为你能逃的了吗
really think you could get away with this?

374
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,330
事实上 我觉得能
As a matter of fact, I did, yeah.

375
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,449
好好歇一会儿吧你
Time for your nap!

376
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,836
醒来时我在一个垃圾站
I woke up in a Dumpster

377
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,838
被一堆尿布盖着
covered in diapers.

378
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,756
我还从一个“不可说”的地方
And I found a pacifier

379
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,392
找到了一枚奶嘴
somewhere I'm not willing to discuss.

380
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,062
我到底怎么了
What is wrong with me?!

381
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,213
你还没从奎恩那儿缓过来
You're still getting over Quinn.

382
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:05,150
你不能一头扎回单身巴尼模式
You can't just dive right back into single Barney mode.

383
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,651
但是我停不下来
But I can't stop myself!

384
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:07,903
我控制不了自己了
I'm out of control!

385
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,388
不 才不呢 我好着呢
No, I'm not. I'm fine!

386
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,555
现在
Now,

387
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:11,823
我要先离开一下
if you'll excuse me,

388
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:16,078
吧台旁那个金发妞看来松得和我的大牙一样好“拔”
that blonde at the bar looks as loose as my rear molars.

389
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
快阻止我  别阻止我  我挺好的  救命 
Stop me! Don't stop me! I'm fine. Help!

390
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,499
单身最棒了 
Being single's great!

391
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:26,922
你知道吗 维多利亚乱糟糟的习惯
You know, Victoria's messiness

392
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:30,675
迫使我成为了一个爱干净的人
just forces me to grow as a cleaner.

393
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:33,178
完全正确 如果没有尼克
Totally. And without Nick,

394
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,963
谁帮我缝裤边
who's gonna hem my pants?

395
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,682
敬可持续发展的爱情
To making these relationships last.

396
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:42,253
这两段感情在这个月内都玩儿完了
Both relationships would implode within the month.

397
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:43,889
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

398
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,391
嘿 你们两个都累晕了吗
Hey. Did you guys conk out?

399
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,477
我想是的
Yeah, I guess we did.

400
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,611
几点了
What time is it?

401
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:50,562
五点
5:00.

402
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:53,064
哇 我们睡了一整天了呢
Wow. We slept all day!

403
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,317
问个问题啊
Quick question. Um,

404
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,234
马尔文在哪里
where's Marvin?

405
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,420
这里啊
Right here.

406
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,051
嘿 伙计们 一惊一乍的做什么
Hey, gang. What's the big whoop?

407
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:14,252
马尔文
Marvin!

408
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,720
老爸 发生什么事了
Dad, what happened?

409
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,840
呃 我早上跑完步回来
Well, when I came back this morning from my jog,

410
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,225
马修已经走了
Marshall was gone,

411
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,761
保姆“爱谁谁”太太也没在
and I couldn't find Mrs. What's-her-face.

412
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:27,983
然后我发现你们俩睡得跟死猪似的 我就来搭把手
And you two were sawing logs, so I figured I'd lend a hand.

413
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,477
那 为啥我醒来的时候
Then, why did I wake up

414
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,163
怀里抱了个猴子
holding a monkey?

415
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,532
这个 没过多久我有点小饿然后就
Well, a little later, I got kind of hungry.

416
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:54,342
而后我给他洗了个澡 涂上护臀膏
So I gave him a bath, and put his diaper rash ointment on,

417
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,194
喂了他豌豆泥 没喂香蕉
and fed him strained peas, not bananas,

418
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,013
因为他昨天才吃了的
'cause he had bananas yesterday,

419
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,231
我还把衣服洗了
and I did the laundry,

420
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,132
干掉了我的卷饼
finished my burrito,

421
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,934
安顿他睡了个午觉
put him down for his nap at noon,

422
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,387
把瓶子消了毒 然后我们刚刚从公园回来
sterilized the bottles, and then we just went to the park.

423
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,888
以上
Okay.

424
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,841
哇塞 这不科学
Wow. That's incredible.

425
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,893
你什么时候起这么会带小孩的
When did you get so good with kids?

426
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,912
我得告诉你一些你早已淡忘的事情 宝贝 
You know something, honey, you don't remember this,

427
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,431
在你人生最初的几年里
but, um, for the first few years of your life,

428
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,367
你的妈妈在工作 所以我就成了家里蹲奶爸
your mom worked, and I was a stay-at-home dad.

429
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,553
我以为是爷爷奶奶来照顾我的
I thought Grandma and Grandpa took care of me.

430
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,654
是啊 他们是经常来看你
Well, they visited a lot,

431
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,840
但是一手把你拉扯大的 还是我
but I was the guy who took care of you.

432
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,591
听着 也许全美国人都认为
You know, America thinks

433
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:29,077
我冲进火海就为了拿盘土豆沙拉
I ran into that burning house to get potato salad,

434
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,630
但实际上 我冲进火海 为的是抢救这本相册
but I actually ran in to get this photo album.

435
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,549
当然 还顺带拿了土豆沙拉
And potato salad. Sure.

436
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,078
爸 我之前就没发现你一直
Dad, I never realized you were...

437
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,232
在我身边
there for me.

438
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:53,618
那为什么在我上学前班之后就没照片了呢
How come there are no pictures of me after I go to preschool?

439
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,588
这个
Well...

440
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,474
唔 就这样吧
Oh. Okay, well,

441
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,694
祝你在学前班的第一天愉快 小公主
have fun on your first day of preschool, Princess.

442
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,013
好了 你去吧
Okay. Off you go.

443
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,182
走了啊
There you go.

444
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,117
哦 不
Ugh!

445
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,037
没她在身边 我怎么熬得到三点啊
How am I gonna make it to 3:00 without her?

446
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:18,727
贝尔蒙特赛马场 唔
"Belmont Race Track?" Hmm.

447
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,429
小赌怡情啊
I guess it couldn't hurt to go just once.

448
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:24,766
六个月后
Six months later,

449
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,302
猜猜看哪个赌鬼的手指得用钢钉接起来哟
guess what gambling addict's thumbs had metal pins in them?

450
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,189
正是在下
This guy.

451
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:34,893
听我说 亲爱的 我是个混蛋
Look, honey, I was a jerk

452
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,028
你童年的大部分时间我都没照顾好你
who wasn't there for most of your childhood,

453
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,231
为此我每天都感到后悔
and I regret that every single day of my life.

454
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,534
但我保证
But I promise you,

455
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,403
现在开始我会照顾好马尔文
I'm here now for Marvin...

456
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,572
如果你愿意的话
if you want.

457
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,542
你被录用了
You're hired.

458
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,744
我仰望着你
I look up to you

459
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:56,131
你却没有看低我
You don't look down on me

460
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,216
你眼中的我是怎样的
What do you see in me?

461
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:01,119
是不是如海洋般深邃
Is it oceans of blue?

462
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:05,674
你如何能用无数种方式
How do you make the colors say

463
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:08,426
让颜色开口述说
In a thousand crazy ways

464
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,679
就在最后
That in the end

465
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:14,849
一切基本就绪
Most things will be okay...

466
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:18,893
十张罚单 对吧
Ten parking tickets, huh?

467
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,646
我想只有一条路可以让你 呃
I suppose there is a way I could, uh...

468
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,548
摆“脱”了
"Get you off."

469
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,117
经典永不褪色啊
Why did I ever doubt a classic?

470
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,036
打住 打住 打住
Now, now, now.

471
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:30,772
你雇我来就是为了制止类似行为的
This is exactly the sort of behavior

472
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,274
斯丁森先生
you hired me to put an end to, Mr. Stinson.

473
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,076
请圆润地离开 亲爱的
Off with you, dear.

474
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,828
不要犯傻了
Go make better decisions!

475
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,000
你是对的
You're right.

476
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,168
谢了 巴克敏斯特太太
Thanks, Mrs. Buckminster.

477
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,370
不客气
You're welcome.

478
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,839
我为你改变自己做出的努力感到骄傲
And I'm proud of you for trying to change.

479
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:49,851
你对这些年轻姑娘们做的事情
What you're doing with these young women

480
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,305
太不合适了
is simply not appropriate.

481
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,571
下不为例
That can never happen again.

482
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,480
哦 省省吧 五次之前你就这么说了
Oh, pish-posh. You said that five times ago.

483
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:10,482
