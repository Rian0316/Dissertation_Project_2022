1
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,562
Old place hasn't changed much, has it?

2
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,405
Samuel Richards.

3
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,362
- Should I know him?
- He robs banks.

4
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,131
- And?
- And...

5
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,330
you and I together are going to catch him.

6
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,442
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

7
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,765
Do you play chess, Michael?

8
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,932
I prefer snakes and ladders.

9
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,208
- It's my great passion.
- I'm happy for you.

10
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,807
I've an IQ of 157.

11
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,003
So when I get the chance to lock horns...

12
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,084
with the great Mickey Bricks...

13
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,368
It's an opportunity too good to miss.

14
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,522
It seems you have me at a disadvantage.

15
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,649
I was in the Fraud Squad for 19 years.

16
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,964
- And now?
- Head of Security at Moores Bank.

17
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:06,046
Ex-cop becomes Head of Security at bank.

18
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,641
It's hardly original.

19
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,884
Original no, but lucrative, yes.

20
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,533
I find it very easy
to negotiate my contract...

21
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,446
with a 100% Conviction rate.

22
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,128
Impressive.

23
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:21,410
I have left every grifter I have ever met...

24
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,281
in my wake.

25
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,524
Including Albert Stroller.

26
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,043
Victor Maher.

27
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,971
Albert's mentioned me, then?

28
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,726
Once. I'm not sure
if I recall the exact words.

29
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,212
Go on, paraphrase.

30
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,891
"An unprincipled reprobate
two-faced son of a bitch."

31
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,252
I do miss Albert.

32
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,931
Friend of yours?

33
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,162
Cut?

34
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,843
I didn't know you could do that.

35
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,208
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

36
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,521
Such as?

37
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:15,204
I could tell you.
But then I'd have to kill you.

38
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,412
That might be worth it.

39
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,610
Are we playing cards or flirting?

40
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,126
I thought we could do both.

41
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,773
Yeah, well, that's why
you'll never grow as a person.

42
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,172
Unlike Mickey?

43
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:30,088
Is that your professional opinion
or is that just because you fancy him?

44
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,289
- Game?
- Dealer's choice?

45
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,641
Of course.

46
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,412
Strip poker.

47
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,725
When he was 17,
Danny's uncle used him as a lookout...

48
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,373
while he and his crew
robbed a casino in Windsor.

49
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,445
Good job. Professional.
They cleaned the place out...

50
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,206
and they took the CCTV tapes with them.

51
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,887
Anyway, last week
one of these tapes turns up...

52
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:55,964
and Danny's uncle's long gone...

53
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,448
but one of his crew
wanted to make a deal.

54
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,570
Old friend of mine in the squad
showed it to me.

55
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:06,531
He knew that Danny was a grifter now,
and he wanted my opinion.

56
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,763
Which I assume
you're about to share with me.

57
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,732
If I show that tape to Robbery,
Danny Blue goes to prison.

58
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,328
And by helping you
I can stop that happening?

59
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,962
Only by helping me
can you stop that from happening.

60
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,766
Now, we've got branches in Edinburgh,
Liverpool, Birmingham, and London.

61
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:27,050
And Richards has hit every one of those
except London.

62
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,291
He arrived here last night.

63
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,333
<i>He's about to find out</i>
<i>that the alarms expert...</i>

64
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,688
<i>he expected to meet has been arrested.</i>

65
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:42,804
<i>A favor from an old colleague.</i>

66
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,367
<i>So he's gonna be looking</i>
<i>for a replacement.</i>

67
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,125
That's where you come in.

68
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,609
Set a thief to catch a thief.

69
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,004
I am not a thief.

70
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,688
Think of it as a way of stopping your pal
from going to prison.

71
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,491
Danny's a big boy now...

72
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,406
he can look after himself.

73
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,209
Three sevens.

74
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,890
Nut straight.

75
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,490
We don't need to take the...

76
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:27,728
I mean, you wouldn't.

77
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,008
To the victor the spoils, Danny.

78
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,728
- Fancy another game?
- You're sick.

79
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,971
Albert's on his way...

80
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,207
Just killing a bit of time.

81
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,806
Albert's on his way to Eddie's Bar.

82
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,123
The mark's going to be another week.

83
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,522
So everyone hang loose.

84
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,884
It's not complicated, Michael.

85
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,483
Either you help me catch him...

86
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,164
or I'll have Danny put away.

87
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,971
When I've got him, you get the tape.

88
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,802
I'm going to need some more information.

89
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,531
You can find me there.

90
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,846
We have to send Danny away.

91
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:12,084
Come on, Albert. For how long?
A month, a year?

92
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,009
You can't deal with this man, Michael,
he's poisonous.

93
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,288
We have to give Danny the choice.

94
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,568
I don't like being manipulated.

95
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:24,323
Victor Maher is a freak of nature.
I know him.

96
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,328
<i>He doesn't care about the bank or Danny...</i>

97
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,051
<i>it's all about the game.</i>

98
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:33,685
<i>He's thrilled at taking on the best grifters</i>
<i>in Europe and out-grifting them.</i>

99
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:37,925
<i>Jimmy Cohen, Mitch Peters,</i>
<i>and Carl Taylor.</i>

100
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,892
<i>You can't outsmart him,</i>
<i>you can't outmaneuver him.</i>

101
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:43,931
<i>He knows every trick we do</i>
<i>and more, besides.</i>

102
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,883
<i>I do believe you have a bogeyman.</i>

103
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,891
Don't go there, Michael.

104
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,167
- He's already winning.
- How so?

105
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,369
If he's studied you like I think he has...

106
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,762
he knows that you have
three weaknesses.

107
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,969
He'll use them against you.

108
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:04,284
Three weaknesses?

109
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:05,841
Loyalty...

110
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,881
that extraordinary ego of yours...

111
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,923
and a psychopathic hatred of being told
what to do by anyone.

112
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:17,562
I watched my father
doing exactly what society told him to.

113
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:22,168
And then I had to watch
as that same sense of duty crushed him.

114
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,202
I know.

115
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,211
Whatever the origins,
Maher knows about them.

116
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,130
He's using Danny right now
to spark your loyalty.

117
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,404
Your ego is beginning
to relish the challenge...

118
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,051
of taking him on.

119
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,124
He'll goad you next...

120
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:42,007
then belittle you enough to suck you in.

121
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,209
Don't do it.

122
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,608
<i>Look, there's an easy way out of this.</i>

123
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,331
<i>I'll just get the tape.</i>

124
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,406
Excuse me. Is that yours?

125
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,491
Thank you.

126
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,645
Michael, you disappoint me.

127
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:01,805
You must have known I'd try.

128
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,203
Yes, of course.
I just didn't expect you to be so clumsy.

129
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,003
Now, what's it gonna be, Michael?

130
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:15,002
Are we to play more games
or are you gonna do as you are told?

131
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,170
And so, the deal.

132
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:23,368
You'll find out when and how
Richards is gonna rob this bank.

133
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,445
If by some strange chance
he changes his mind...

134
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,330
the tape goes to the police.

135
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,971
If he sprains his ankle...

136
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,203
or his wrist
or any other part of his anatomy...

137
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,285
then you will drag him
into the vault yourself.

138
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,284
Or the tape will go to the police.

139
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,170
When he opens the vault...

140
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,209
and only when he's opened the vault...

141
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,649
and only when you and I
have watched him open the vault...

142
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,291
will you get the tape.

143
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:49,047
And how do I know
you haven't made a copy?

144
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,404
Because that would suggest...

145
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,166
that I have considered the possibility...

146
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,762
that you can outwit me.

147
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,611
Which you haven't.

148
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,164
After this last performance,
the only possibility I would consider...

149
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,448
is that I have overestimated you.

150
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:11,405
So now, be a good boy, will you?
Go catch my thief.

151
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,811
Are you still here?

152
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,489
If it's any consolation...

153
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,205
even I have a boss.

154
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,603
You see, Michael, sooner or later...

155
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,242
everybody has to serve someone.

156
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:35,847
Even you.

157
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:44,802
Check.

158
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,566
Did you get it?

159
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,931
He was waiting for me.

160
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:55,846
So what now?

161
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,771
Work on Sam Richards.

162
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,163
I'll do what Maher wants.
Let's brief the others.

163
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:08,165
Sam Richards has now hit
four branches of Moores Bank.

164
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,926
We got a tip-off
he's due to hit the London branch.

165
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,128
I don't get it.

166
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:15,888
- Since when do we rob banks?
- We don't. Richards is going to.

167
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,367
So what's the con?

168
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,604
It's going to happen anyway.
We just take a slice after the fact.

169
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,526
Well, that still sounds
like robbing banks to me.

170
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,446
Since when did we ask
where a mark got his money?

171
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,206
If it's going down anyway,
then it makes him fair game.

172
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:34,252
Yeah, and it makes us accessories before,
during, and after the fact.

173
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,087
The cupboard is bare.
Guys, we need a score and we need it fast.

174
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,766
I'm with Michael.

175
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,683
Okay, so what do we know about him?

176
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,571
Not much, except that
he seems to dislike banks.

177
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,166
Who doesn't?

178
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,612
So what's the in?

179
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,684
He needs an alarms expert.

180
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,331
We use Ash as the bait.

181
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,085
What do you know about alarms?

182
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,687
- I know about everything.
- You know about everything?

183
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,003
Okay, if you know about everything...

184
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,449
what's the capital of Luxembourg?

185
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,052
Luxembourg City.

186
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,881
- You're good, you're very good.
- Thank you very much.

187
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,770
You're not helping, Danny.

188
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:19,206
Don't start having a go at me, girl,
just because you've seen me naked.

189
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,207
Don't ask.

190
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,492
Okay, this is what we do.

191
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:29,046
<i>Richards is staying</i>
<i>at the Royal Lodge Hotel.</i>

192
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:32,088
<i>Albert will hook him in from there.</i>

193
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,046
<i>Once he's made contact...</i>

194
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,522
<i>he introduces him to me as a local fixer...</i>

195
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,171
<i>and I pass him on to Ash.</i>

196
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,845
What about Danny and me?

197
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,322
We keep you two floating, plug any gaps.

198
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,769
Okay, come on, let's do it.

199
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:55,962
Naked?

200
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,244
- Strip poker.
- Right.

201
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,922
- You were jealous.
- No, I wasn't.

202
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,446
- Yes, you were.
- No.

203
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,809
I was just concerned you may have been
taking advantage of him.

204
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,292
Of course you are.

205
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,772
Can you do something for me?

206
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,413
Yeah, I'll go and get the cards now
if you like.

207
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,522
No, I need you to...

208
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,490
keep Danny out of the way for a while.

209
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,564
It's important. I'll explain why later.

210
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,927
Is he in trouble?

211
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:24,049
Just keep him occupied.

212
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,089
- Okay.
- Thanks.

213
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,401
I don't believe this.

214
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,053
What is the Bank of England interest rate?
3.5%?

215
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,124
They've charged me 10 times this...

216
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:37,091
for a credit card I didn't want
in the first place.

217
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,447
What's all this?

218
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:52,242
Alarms.

219
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,131
- I thought you knew about alarms.
- I do. I'm just a bit rusty.

220
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,169
- We're on a clock here.
- I know.

221
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:01,484
Floating? What's that all about?

222
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,131
Are you going to bitch all day?

223
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,363
Albert, okay, he's the roper.

224
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,967
Ash does the fixing. Mickey, inside man.

225
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:12,285
Me? I'm a floater.
To me that sounds like a turd.

226
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,610
And we do like to be center stage,
don't we, Danny?

227
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:19,129
I have a talent.
It's my duty to share it with the world.

228
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:22,171
- That's very thoughtful of you.
- Hey, I love it.

229
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:24,131
So what's wrong with that?

230
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,125
You're telling me you don't?

231
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:28,522
- It's a means to an end.
- What end?

232
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:34,566
Saving enough money to buy a small
place in the Caribbean one day. That's it.

233
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,723
So you're saying it's just a job to you?

234
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,087
I didn't say that.

235
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,731
So you love it really?

236
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,771
Is there any point to this?

237
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,890
Yes. You know, indulge me.

238
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,848
I tell you what.
Why don't you tell me about you?

239
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,692
Hello, again.

240
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,444
We met briefly at breakfast.

241
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:09,729
Yeah, I remember. Sorry.

242
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,169
- George Cooper.
- Sam Richards.

243
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,964
- Can I get you a drink?
- Scotch. Thanks.

244
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:21,091
You look like a man
who's had a tough morning.

245
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,964
I was expecting someone,
but they've gone AWOL.

246
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:28,689
- Is there anything I can help you with?
- No, I doubt it.

247
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,970
Just remember:
There are no such things as problems...

248
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,521
simply opportunities for solutions.

249
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,403
Thanks. I'll try and remember it.

250
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,892
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

251
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,606
Okay, mate. I love all the old cons.

252
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,523
You know, stuff they wrote about
in books...

253
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,285
in the '20s and '30s.

254
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,811
People like Charles Ponzi,
"Yellow Kid" Weil.

255
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,493
- Danny, you're an old romantic.
- See...

256
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,484
I knew you'd take the piss.

257
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,766
No, I'm not. I promise.

258
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:07,169
I don't know.
I just always wanted to try one.

259
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,768
- See what it'd feel like.
- Well, then.

260
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,332
You shall.

261
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,804
Take my game. Insurance.

262
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,486
We had a claim last year...

263
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,803
that I was damn certain was an inside job.

264
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,169
There was a burglary at a stately home.
State-of-the-art security.

265
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:27,164
They were in and gone...

266
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,450
with the family jewels
without so much as a footprint.

267
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,253
Trouble was,
not only did we need an alarms man...

268
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,563
but a crooked one
to tell us how it was fixed.

269
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,166
Did you find one?

270
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:41,092
Well, fortunately, I had a contact for that.

271
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,967
Terribly unethical,
but needs must and all that.

272
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,483
- Can I get you another?
- Yeah.

273
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,887
Yeah, Albert? Bring him in.

274
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,044
No, I meant to do that, don't worry.

275
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,412
Can you hear me?

276
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,812
I'll quiet it down for you.

277
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:17,888
What?

278
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:22,767
Danny boy, well done.

279
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,526
Let's get out of here.

280
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,406
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

281
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:30,926
- Have you lost a dog?
- Yes.

282
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,573
- I think he might be in that pub.
- Thank you.

283
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:40,123
This is Vincent Cole.

284
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:42,682
Vincent, this is Sam. Sam Richards.

285
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:46,086
No offence, gentlemen,
but I get the distinct impression...

286
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:48,084
that I don't want to hear this conversation.

287
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:50,926
- Thank you, George.
- My very great pleasure.

288
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:58,443
George tells me you have contacts
in a field that I need help with.

289
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,411
- Which is?
- Alarm systems.

290
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:04,921
And what kind of help are you looking for?

291
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,329
- Does it matter?
- Lf you're straight up, no.

292
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,881
But if you're a cop,
I need to hear you say the words...

293
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,726
so I can plead entrapment
when I'm arrested.

294
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,924
Okay, I have other things to do.

295
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:18,332
Sorry.

296
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,885
Coffee, thanks.

297
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:27,811
I'm planning to rob a bank.

298
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,645
And a bell man is an afterthought?

299
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,132
I've been let down.

300
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:33,931
I can get into the bank.

301
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,531
I can deal with the outer security
until I get to the vault.

302
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,285
That's where I need help.

303
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,607
It's a Locheim system with retinal scan.

304
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,285
That needs a specialist.

305
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:47,922
I had a guy lined up,
but he was arrested last night.

306
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,483
- Can you bypass it?
- No.

307
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:54,123
The only one with the security override
is Victor Maher.

308
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,091
The Head of Security.

309
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,323
Okay, so when are you going in?

310
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,689
- Tomorrow night.
- Here you go, pal.

311
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:03,246
Thanks.

312
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,686
So? Can you help?

313
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:09,488
No.

314
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,649
But I know a man who can.

315
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,601
It's a piece of cake.

316
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:21,003
You hack into the retina scans
and reprogram new settings.

317
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,164
What are these new settings?

318
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,884
You take your own scanner,
replace their retinal scans with your own.

319
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:29,771
I can give you the software
and talk you through the process.

320
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:32,128
Whatever you do,
remember to wipe both scans...

321
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,044
on the computer memory
before you leave...

322
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,601
otherwise it's like
leaving your fingerprints behind.

323
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,127
Hang on. Both scans?

324
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,289
The Locheim's been updated at Moores.

325
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:44,603
It's a double scan, two people,
eight feet apart.

326
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,571
- How many in your crew?
- One.

327
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,686
- You're doing this on your own?
- That's how I work.

328
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,003
The scan's the least of your worries.

329
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,891
You won't even be able
to carry the bleeding money out.

330
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,924
I won't be taking any money out.

331
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:03,333
My dad was <i>4</i>7 when he took a shotgun...

332
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,485
<i>placed it under his chin</i>
<i>and pulled the trigger.</i>

333
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:11,769
He ran a small diamond-cutting business
started by my great-grandfather.

334
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,172
By the time Dad took over...

335
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,130
bigger companies
were buying new machines...

336
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,169
making stones quicker, cheaper.

337
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,483
So he took out a loan to keep afloat.

338
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,611
When the bank called the loan in...

339
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,968
he felt he let down his entire family.

340
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,324
He was too ashamed to face us.

341
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,252
Moores Bank?

342
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,245
They're a cancer.

343
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,602
- Playground bullies.
- What? So this is revenge?

344
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:36,844
Have you any idea what it's like
to watch your father die?

345
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:38,692
Watch your whole family...

346
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,845
everything you've ever known and loved
disintegrate in a second?

347
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:45,369
All he ever wanted to do
was play it straight, you know?

348
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,452
Toe the line.

349
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,089
I know this sounds stupid...

350
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,843
but this isn't about the money.

351
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,482
Go on.

352
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:59,612
In the '20s,
my grandfather bought a stone.

353
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,252
Still uncut...

354
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,405
but even then
it must have been worth £250,000.

355
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,161
The bank took it to recoup my dad's loan.

356
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,409
But instead of putting it up for auction...

357
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,405
they kept it for themselves
and wrote off the loan.

358
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,769
That loan was £<i>4</i>0,000.

359
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:24,653
I've taken back every penny
that they stole...

360
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,645
and caused as much damage as I could
in the process.

361
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,204
But now I'm gonna get the diamond.

362
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,647
Then that's it. Then it's over.

363
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,249
And that's what's in the vault?

364
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,972
Yeah. But they're moving it
the day after tomorrow.

365
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:43,328
That's why I have to do this now.

366
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:48,884
Only, if what you say about them
updating the alarm is true...

367
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,770
I can't do it on my own.

368
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,883
<i>Have you any idea what it's like</i>
<i>to watch your father die?</i>

369
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,611
<i>Watch your whole family...</i>

370
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:16,129
<i>everything you've ever known and loved</i>
<i>disintegrate in a second?</i>

371
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:20,047
<i>My dad worked, ate, and slept.</i>

372
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,567
<i>Paid his taxes on time, toed the line.</i>

373
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:26,204
<i>The only dream he had was retiring.</i>

374
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:30,288
<i>Worked himself to death</i>
<i>three days before his 60th birthday.</i>

375
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:33,488
<i>Everybody has to serve someone.</i>

376
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:36,201
<i>Even you.</i>

377
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,848
Oh, my God, can you take a chip?

378
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,283
- Come on.
- Bingo.

379
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,721
Hello.

380
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:46,925
You were married before this, right?

381
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:50,085
That's how I got into the life.
He was a smalltime hustler.

382
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:52,129
I'd play a whore, pick up a mark...

383
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,647
Jake would burst in
as the irate pimp or boyfriend...

384
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,770
- and threaten to tell their wives.
- Classy, isn't it?

385
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:01,323
I thought we were building a future.

386
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:04,044
Then five years ago...

387
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,250
he cleared out all our savings
and he disappeared.

388
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,289
You ever seen him since?

389
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,646
Do you miss him?

390
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,962
Of course I did for a while, yeah...

391
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:18,850
but no, not anymore.

392
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:22,409
I'm not even angry anymore.
Things are what they are.

393
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:26,643
So where does Mickey fit into all this?

394
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,491
He helped me out when Jake left.

395
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,848
You knew him before, though, right?

396
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,321
- Can we talk about something else?
- Lf you want.

397
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:43,372
What about...

398
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,250
What about you and me?

399
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:49,932
What about us?

400
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,049
I don't know about you, okay...

401
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,764
but I really enjoyed today.

402
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,086
Yeah, it was fun.

403
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:01,729
I just got the feeling
that you wanted to be with me.

404
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:11,165
You know I like you.

405
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,766
Down, boy.

406
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,364
I know you like me, too.

407
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,643
I must say,
when you're not being obnoxious...

408
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,928
you can be really quite sweet.

409
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:24,488
So?

410
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,767
- How was it for you?
- Sorry. I can't.

411
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,807
- What do you mean, you can't?
- All right. I won't!

412
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:02,646
I told you once before,
I don't screw people I work with.

413
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,008
People? Or is it just me?

414
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:13,007
What makes him so special?

415
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,212
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

416
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,124
- Danny?
- Don't ask me.

417
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:26,885
I'm just floating.

418
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,651
<i>Someone to see you.</i>

419
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,010
<i>Albert Stroller.</i>

420
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,126
<i>Victor Maher.</i>

421
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,051
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

422
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,566
<i>It certainly has.</i>

423
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,883
<i>- You're looking well.</i>
<i>- Why, thank you.</i>

424
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,851
<i>You look as though</i>
<i>you're doing pretty well yourself.</i>

425
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:29,410
You went to see Maher. He sent me this.

426
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:32,446
He taped it. I didn't see that coming.

427
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,842
You begged him to leave me alone.

428
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,604
I didn't beg him, I asked.

429
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:40,491
What makes you think
I need yours or anyone else's protection?

430
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,291
You've no idea what you're getting into.

431
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:45,445
- I'm keeping Danny out of prison.
- You're putting yourself back in.

432
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,127
- What?
- Sit down.

433
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,644
Swallow your pride and sit down.

434
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:03,206
Now think.

435
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,766
Yes, of course I am.

436
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,566
No, sir. I understand, sir.

437
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:12,247
Richards has been plaguing Maher's bank.

438
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,449
He's hit branches in four other cities.

439
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,922
They haven't even come close
to catching him.

440
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,810
It's driving him mad.

441
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:33,088
<i>He goes for a beer with some</i>
<i>of his old friends from the Fraud Squad...</i>

442
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:36,131
<i>and all he hears about is you.</i>

443
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,444
He set you up to catch Richards.

444
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:40,722
Why?

445
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,085
To prove he can.

446
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,721
There's that ego again.

447
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,969
He set me up to catch Richards...

448
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,125
to put us in the same place.

449
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:56,885
And why would he do that?

450
00:32:57,493 --> 00:32:58,926
To...

451
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,211
Please tell me you haven't.

452
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:05,568
I'm going into the vault with Sam.

453
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:09,566
- Because?
- His father...

454
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:11,926
It's a long story.

455
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,330
I'm sure there's a bleeding heart
in there somewhere.

456
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:18,731
And I guarantee that Maher knew
that's what you'd do.

457
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,645
Am I that predictable?

458
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,451
He plays to your weaknesses.

459
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,251
He gets you both in the same place...

460
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,131
he leaves you no way out,
then he calls the police.

461
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,568
Then he gets what he desires most.

462
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:33,692
To be the man
who outsmarted Mickey Bricks.

463
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,561
Danny stays out of prison
and you go down instead.

464
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,450
You taught me
there was always a way out.

465
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,445
Because I never thought
you'd run into Victor Maher.

466
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:47,531
He lures you into the game,
plays you like a violin.

467
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,727
Every grifter he's sent away
made the same mistake:

468
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:53,691
They all thought
that they could outthink him.

469
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:56,045
But they couldn't.

470
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,370
I love you like a son...

471
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,888
but I don't think you could, either.

472
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,369
- You want to play?
- No, I want to win.

473
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,252
I give up.

474
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:22,927
Help me?

475
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,042
Okay.

476
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:34,406
What makes you strong?

477
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:36,643
What I know, what you taught me.

478
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:37,961
That's not enough.

479
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,123
He beat me, remember?

480
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:42,648
The others.

481
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,086
And where are they?

482
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:47,131
<i>Ash doesn't know anything, wonders why.</i>

483
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,364
<i>He thinks you don't trust him.</i>

484
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,564
<i>Stacie's bright as a button...</i>

485
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:56,962
<i>the best ally you've ever had.</i>

486
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,329
<i>Have you asked her advice?</i>

487
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:06,526
<i>And Danny's grift sense</i>
<i>could put even you in the shade one day.</i>

488
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,366
Have you used him?

489
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,408
No. And why not?

490
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,325
Because you're too proud to ask.

491
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:19,088
You think the whole world is better off
resting on your shoulders.

492
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,771
You've got a good brain.

493
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:24,922
Use it.

494
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,123
You two not talking, then?

495
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:41,051
He's impossible.

496
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:44,929
So you're angry with Danny
for being Danny?

497
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,522
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,211
Don't worry about it.

499
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:15,248
I mean it.

500
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:19,049
And I really did enjoy today.

501
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:27,003
Stacie, Mickey wants you.

502
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:35,406
So you knew all this
and never said a word to me?

503
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,053
That was wrong, Danny. I'm sorry.

504
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:41,364
And that goes for all of you.
We're strongest as a team.

505
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:43,572
I tend to forget that.

506
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,087
So if you don't set this guy up,
Danny goes to prison.

507
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:47,686
And if you do, you go instead?

508
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:48,842
That's about it.

509
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,161
That's a good deal.

510
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,005
Aren't we all missing the point now?

511
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:55,642
- Which is?
- Lf I go away, so does the problem.

512
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,007
That's not an option.

513
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:59,402
Because of the whole family,
musketeer thing.

514
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:01,723
Listen, I'm the new kid. I'll let you off that.

515
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,929
No, because it means he'll have beaten us.

516
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,527
You don't get the tape
till this guy's opened the vault?

517
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:07,602
Right.

518
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,763
And he can't open the vault
without one of us.

519
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,968
Right, too.

520
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,203
At which point you both get a tug.

521
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,692
I don't see how we can win.

522
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,333
If we get you inside,
can we get you out another way?

523
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,165
No, there's one way in, one way out.

524
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,766
It's like one of them things.

525
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,208
It takes three blokes
four hours to dig a hole.

526
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:27,047
How long does it take six men
to dig a smaller hole?

527
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,012
Shut up, Danny.

528
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,369
The question is, do we have any ideas?

529
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,849
I don't think I've ever had so much fun.

530
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,367
I'm glad to have been of service.

531
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,286
It ain't all over till the fat lady sings.

532
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,563
Don't you disappoint me by giving up.

533
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,687
The options you've left me
are rather limited.

534
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,683
I haven't left you any options.

535
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,770
That's how this thing works.

536
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,050
So, when?

537
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,445
- Tonight.
- How?

538
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:10,890
He's hacking into the mainframe
and resetting the retina scans.

539
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,167
Clever.

540
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:13,845
But there's a problem.

541
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:16,283
- It takes two people.
- No.

542
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,885
What are you going to do?

543
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,251
I'm going in with him.

544
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,282
But you already knew that, didn't you?

545
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:26,523
Seemed like the logical thing.

546
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,772
Albert will be there. Give him the tape.

547
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,812
When I see your face next to Sam's,
and the vault door open.

548
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:43,327
It's been a pleasure
running rings round you.

549
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,407
The bank.

550
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:16,567
Stacie, you and Danny
go and set up the first phase.

551
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:23,525
We'd like to see the manager, please.

552
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,649
Can I ask what it's in connection with?

553
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,882
Police.

554
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:30,848
Albert next.

555
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:32,969
They know who he is,
so we'll need a disguise.

556
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:35,726
Peregrin B. Winterhill III, I think.

557
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:36,962
Perfect.

558
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:40,170
That should provide enough of a diversion
for me and Sam to get in.

559
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,721
I'll pick up the materials
and meet you there, Danny.

560
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,485
Can you sort out the present?

561
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,724
Okay, let's do it.

562
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,806
Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed, you know.

563
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,804
I'm sorry, I can't bend over.

564
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,445
Right, phase two.

565
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:01,246
Two gates at the side.
Mickey will take care of the locks.

566
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,846
Which will bring you to this door.

567
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:05,970
By that time,
Albert will just be arriving to meet Maher.

568
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,567
You guys should be in position
by this time.

569
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:12,805
If Maher's as smart as Albert says he is,
it won't take him long to figure it out.

570
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:14,531
From this point, he'll be running.

571
00:41:14,613 --> 00:41:16,729
That will give you
three and a half minutes.

572
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:17,962
All right?

573
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:25,690
We know they'll be coming in,
nothing we can do about that.

574
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:28,765
So they'll be using this direction
to get out. You understand me?

575
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,208
This direction, so you stay alert.

576
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:33,691
We'll be one step ahead.

577
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:57,967
You ready?

578
00:42:41,373 --> 00:42:44,490
Albert, just in time for the show.

579
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:10,522
They're in. Switch to the vault cameras.

580
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,528
- Get your men in position.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

581
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,693
This must be very galling for you, Albert...

582
00:43:21,253 --> 00:43:23,608
watching the downfall of your protégé.

583
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,402
Gotcha.

584
00:43:27,293 --> 00:43:29,090
That's the one. Come on.

585
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,643
They're in the vault.
Seal the outer door. I'm coming down.

586
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,412
Care to join me, Albert?

587
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:36,324
Watch my moment of glory.

588
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,051
Just give me the tape.

589
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:45,132
Say "please."

590
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,052
Please.

591
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:58,608
Sir.

592
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:02,690
Smoke. I repeat, smoke.
Get the gas masks.

593
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,887
Unlock it.

594
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,085
They won't get through, sir.

595
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,243
Where's the smoke? I smell smoke.

596
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,252
What's going on?

597
00:44:25,453 --> 00:44:27,205
Security override.

598
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,052
Move!

599
00:45:00,653 --> 00:45:02,291
Move out of the way!

600
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:17,772
They've rerouted it. Oh, shit.

601
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,566
Come on, quickly!

602
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,769
They must have routed it next door.

603
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:33,327
What's going on?

604
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:34,528
What's in there?

605
00:45:34,613 --> 00:45:37,525
You can't go in there.
It's police surveillance.

606
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:07,604
Quick, back to the vault.

607
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:13,851
Fancy meeting you here.

608
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,132
Two minutes.

609
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:36,602
Got it.

610
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:42,444
- Let's go.
- You are joking?

611
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,852
We're not thieves, Danny.

612
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:46,493
Listen, speak for yourself.
I'm very versatile.

613
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:48,768
Mickey said to take the diamond and go.

614
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:50,684
- Mickey says...
- Danny.

615
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,286
Let's go.

616
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:11,967
What's up with him?

617
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:14,089
He's just having a personal crisis.

618
00:47:14,173 --> 00:47:16,289
It's got millions in there.

619
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:53,929
Milk train leaves in half an hour.

620
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:57,601
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Then don't.

621
00:47:57,693 --> 00:47:59,524
You actually did me a favor.

622
00:48:00,813 --> 00:48:03,964
- Really?
- I learnt a lot about myself.

623
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,202
What's important.

624
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:07,523
My dad was important to me.

625
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:09,012
Mine, too.

626
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:11,886
You take care.

627
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:23,522
Well, that went rather well, right?

628
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,205
Like the man said:

629
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:28,883
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.

630
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,244
Which reminds me.

631
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:43,807
Yes?

632
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:46,009
Nice try, Victor, but no cigar.

633
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,772
But as I enjoyed
playing the game so much...

634
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:50,684
we've arranged a little present for you...

635
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:52,923
<i>if you'd like to look out</i>
<i>of your office window...</i>

636
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,607
<i>courtesy of our friend, Mr. Albert Stroller.</i>

637
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:28,565
- I'd love to have seen his face.
- Me, too.

638
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,052
Right, in the office.

639
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:34,887
I'll turn in. I'm absolutely knackered.

640
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,008
What?

641
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:41,929
- Was he left alone in the vault at any time?
- Now, wait a minute.

642
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,891
He forgot to leave the chess piece,
had to go back.

643
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:47,168
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, dear.

644
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:49,323
Danny, is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

645
00:49:49,413 --> 00:49:51,563
- What're you talking about?
- Want me to frisk him?

646
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:53,052
I haven't done anything.

647
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,522
Good, then you won't mind
unbuttoning your jacket.

648
00:49:55,613 --> 00:49:57,683
- You don't trust me?
- Unbutton.

649
00:49:58,813 --> 00:49:59,928
Go on, show us.

650
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:02,766
That is unbelievable.
What have I ever got...

651
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:04,571
- Turn around.
- Go easy.

652
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,531
All right, do what you want.

653
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:09,570
Hold on, you didn't take any money?

654
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:12,121
No, I didn't, mate. But you know what?

655
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:15,649
I'm shocked and a little bit upset
that you thought that I did.

656
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,132
Thanks, guys.

657
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,809
Well, just must have been me then.

658
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:24,762
You?

659
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:27,003
- Expenses.
- You're the thief.

660
00:50:30,013 --> 00:50:31,128
One each.

661
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:35,372
Except...

662
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:41,292
I've got two.

663
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:52,362
Thief.

664
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,086
- 50 pence.
- There you go.

665
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:20,642
Thanks.

666
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,803
Hang on, the rest of your change.

667
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,162
Sorry.

668
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:26,448
Four makes five and five's £10.

669
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:30,044
I've got a £1 coin.
Give me my £10 back, will you, Eddie?

670
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:31,930
I'll give you £5 and five £1.

671
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:33,844
Help me lose this change.

672
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,286
Better check it.

673
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:38,126
- Hang on, there's only £9 here.
- Sorry.

674
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:40,843
- What have you got there?
- £9.

675
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:43,447
I'll give you £11, you give me £20.

676
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,602
All right.

677
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:47,447
Thanks.

678
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:51,367
Wait a minute.
Did you do something funny there?

679
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:52,852
Of course not.

680
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:54,242
English
