飞天大盗 第1季第4集

5
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,562
哦,老地方没怎么变,对吧?
Old place hasn't changed much,has it?

6
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,405
这是Samuel Richards
Samuel Richards.

7
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,362
- 我应该认识他吗? - 他抢劫银行
- Should I know him? - He robs banks.

8
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,131
- 然后? - 然后...

9
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,330
你和我一起去逮住他
you and I together are going to catch him.

10
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,442
我想你认错人了
I think you have me confused with someone else.

11
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,765
你玩象棋吗,Michael?
Do you play chess,Michael?

12
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,932
我比较喜欢玩蛇爬梯子（一种棋盘游戏）.
I prefer snakes and ladders.

13
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,208
- 这是我兴之所在 - 真高兴
- It's my great passion. - I'm happy for you.

14
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,807
我的IQ是157
I've an IQ of 157.

15
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,003
所以一旦我有机会...
So when I get the chance to lock horns...

16
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,084
挫挫伟大的Mickey Bricks的锐气...
with the great Mickey Bricks...

17
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,368
这样的机会是绝对不能放过的
It's an opportunity too good to miss.

18
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,522
你似乎让我处于危险境地

19
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,649
我曾在反诈骗组呆了19年

20
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,964
- 那么现在呢? - Moores银行安全部主管
- And now? - Head of Security at Moores Bank.

21
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:06,046
老警察成了银行安全部门的头儿
Ex-cop becomes Head of Security at bank.

22
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,641
性质不太一样啊
It's hardly original.

23
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,884
哦,两回事,不过,有利可图,是的
Original no,but lucrative,yes.

24
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,533
我想既然有百分之百的确信...
I find it very easy to negotiate my contract...

25
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,446
那签署合同不是件难事
with a 100% Conviction rate.

26
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,128
有创意
Impressive.

27
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:21,410
我可是放走了每个我见到的骗子...
I have left every grifter I have ever met...

28
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,281
就在我眼皮底下

00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,524
包括Albert Stroller
Including Albert Stroller.

30

哦,你是Victor Maher
Victor Maher.

31
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,971
Albert提过我,对吧?
Albert's mentioned me,then?

32
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,726
提过一次.我不肯定我记得清不清楚
Once.I'm not sure if I recall the exact words.

33
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,212
说说看
Go on,paraphrase.

34
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,891
"一个不道德的无耻的 两面派混蛋"
"An unprincipled reprobate two-faced son of a bitch."

35
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,252
我真的很想Albert
I do miss Albert.

36
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,931
你朋友?
Friend of yours?

37
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,162
切牌?
Cut?

38
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,843
我不知道你还有这手
I didn't know you could do that.

39
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,208
你不知道我的东西多着呢,dannie
There's a lot of things you don't know about me.

40
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,521
例如?
Such as?

41
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:15,204
我可以告诉你 不过那样的话,我就得干掉你
I could tell you.But then I'd have to kill you.

42
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,412
那也值了
That might be worth it.

43
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,610
我们是打牌呢还是要调情?
Are we playing cards or flirting?

44
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,126
我想我们可以两样同时做
I thought we could do both.

45
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,773
哦,是的,这就是为什么你总也长不大
Yeah,well,that's why you'll never grow as a person.

46
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,172
不像Mickey是吗?
Unlike Mickey?

47
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:30,088
这是你的专业意见还是仅仅 出于你对他的迷恋?
Is that your professional opinion or is that just because you fancy him?

48
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,289
- 还玩不玩? - 庄家选?
- Game? - Dealer's choice?

49
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,641
当然
Of course.

50
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,412
剥猪猡（每输一局就得脱一件衣服的扑克游戏）
Strip poker.

51
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,725
Danny17岁的时候 他叔叔就叫他望风...
When he was 17,Danny's uncle used him as a lookout...

52
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,373
而他和他的同伙 则抢劫了Windsor的一家赌场
while he and his crew robbed a casino in Windsor.

53
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,445
干得非常漂亮,很专业 他们清场的时候...
Good job.Professional.They cleaned the place out...

54
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,206
连闭路电视带子都带走了
and they took the CCTV tapes with them.

55
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,887
不管怎样,上星期找到了其中了一盘带子...
Anyway,last week one of these tapes turns up...

56
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:55,964
Danny的叔叔早不干了...
and Danny's uncle's long gone...

57
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,448
但他其中的一个同伙想做这笔交易
but one of his crew wanted to make a deal.

58
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,570
我以前组里的一个朋友把它给我看了看
Old friend of mine in the squad showed it to me.

59
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:06,531
他知道Danny现在是个骗子 而且他征询了下我的意见
He knew that Danny was a grifter now,and he wanted my opinion.

60
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,763
我想这也正是你所要跟我说的
Which I assume you're about to share with me.

61
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,732
如果我把带子交给反抢劫组,Danny Blue就得进监狱
If I show that tape to Robbery,Danny Blue goes to prison.

62
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,328
而我帮了你,就能制止这一切的发生?
And by helping you I can stop that happening?

63
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,962
是只有你帮了我,才能制止这一切的发生
Only by helping me can you stop that from happening.

64
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,766
目前我们在Edinburgh,Liverpool,Birmingham和London都有分部
Now,we've got branches in Edinburgh,Liverpool,Birmingham,and London.

65
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:27,050
而Richards每个地方都干过了,除了伦敦
And Richards has hit every one of those except London.

66
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,291
他昨天晚上到的这儿
He arrived here last night.

67
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,333
<i>他得知他想见的</i>

68
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,688
<i>警报专家已经被捕了</i>

69
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:42,804
<i>一个老同事的帮助</i>
<i>A favor from an old colleague.</i>

70
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,367
<i>所以他肯定得另外找个人代替</i>
<i>So he's gonna be looking for a replacement.</i>

71
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,125
然后该你上场了
That's where you come in.

72
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,609
贼抓贼
Set a thief to catch a thief.

73
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,004
我,可不是贼
I am not a thief.

74
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,688
设想一下你伙伴可以免于牢狱之灾
Think of it as a way of stopping your pal from going to prison.

75
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,491
Danny现在已经长大了
Danny's a big boy now...

76
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,406
他能自己照顾自己

00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,209

同花顺

我们不需要把...

我是说,你不至于
I mean,you wouldn't.

00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,008
愿赌服输,Danny
To the victor the spoils,Danny.

82
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,728
- 换个游戏? - 嘿,你个变态

83
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,971
Albert在路上了

84
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,207
只是在消磨时间

Albert在去Eddie酒吧的路上

你对付不了这家伙,Michael,他极其恶毒

Victor Maher是个变态 我了解他

<i>他才不在乎什么银行或者Danny</i>

101

<i>他只在乎游戏本身</i>

<i>他就喜欢找上欧洲的欺诈高手 然后胜过他们</i>

<i>You can't outsmart him,</i> <i>you can't outmaneuver him.</i>

106
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,883

- 他已经赢了 - 怎么回事?

109
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,369
如果如我所想,他盯上了你
If he's studied you like I think he has...

110
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,762
那他就知道了你三个弱点

111
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,969
他会用他们来对付你
He'll use them against you.

忠诚
Loyalty...

114
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,881
你的狂妄自大
that extraordinary ego of yours...

115
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,923
以及对于被要求怎么做的疯狂仇恨
and a psychopathic hatred of being told what to do by anyone.

116
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:17,562
我亲眼看着我父亲循规蹈矩
I watched my father doing exactly what society told him to.

117
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:22,168
而我也看到正是这个责任毁了我父亲
And then I had to watch as that same sense of duty crushed him.

118
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,202
我知道
I know.

119
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,211
不管什么目的 Maher知道这一切
Whatever the origins,Maher knows about them.

120
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,130
他正利用Danny激起你的忠诚

121
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,404
而你的自负又让你面对这个挑战
Your ego is beginning to relish the challenge...

122
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,051
接受了他
of taking him on.

123
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,124
接下来,他会刺激你
He'll goad you next...

124
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:42,007
然后削弱你足以毁了你
then belittle you enough to suck you in.

125
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,209
别去干
Don't do it.

126
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,608
<i>看,还有更容易的办法</i>
<i>Look,there's an easy way out of this.</i>

127
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,331
我要去拿到那盘带子
<i>I'll just get the tape.</i>

128
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,406
打扰了,这是你的吗?
Excuse me.Is that yours?

129
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,491
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,645
Michael你太让我失望了
Michael,you disappoint me.

131
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:01,805
你必须了解,我已经尝试过了
You must have known I'd try.

132
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,203
这当然 我只是没想到你会这么傻
Yes,of course.I just didn't expect you to be so clumsy.

133
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,003
现在,怎么办Michael?
Now,what's it gonna be,Michael?

134
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:15,002
我们接着玩儿,还是赶快办正事?
Are we to play more games or are you gonna do as you are told?

135
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,170
那么,交易
And so,the deal.

136
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:23,368
你会知道Richards将何时以及如何抢劫这家
You'll find out when and how Richards is gonna rob this bank.

137
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,445
如果他离奇得改变了主意
If by some strange chance he changes his mind...

138
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,330
那带子就会交到警察局
the tape goes to the police.

139
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,971
要是他扭到了脚踝
If he sprains his ankle...

140
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,203
或者他的腰啦,身体的其他部分啊
or his wrist or any other part of his anatomy...

141
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,285
这是你把他推向了坟墓
then you will drag him into the vault yourself.

142
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,284
带子会交到警察局
Or the tape will go to the police.

143
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,170
当他打开保险箱的时候...
When he opens the vault...

144
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,209
只有在他正在打开的时候
and only when he's opened the vault...

145
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,649
只有在你和我看着他打开的时候
and only when you and I have watched him open the vault...

146
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,291
你才能拿到带子
will you get the tape.

147
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:49,047
我怎么知道你没有拷贝?
And how do I know you haven't made a copy?

148
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,404
因为那样就证明了
Because that would suggest...

149
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,166
我已经考虑到
that I have considered the possibility...

150
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,762
你比我聪明的可能性
that you can outwit me.

151
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,611
这是不可能的
Which you haven't.

152
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,164
在这最后的演习之后 我唯一意识到的可能就是
After this last performance,the only possibility I would consider...

153
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,448
我高估了你
is that I have overestimated you.

154
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:11,405
所以,现在,乖乖的,好吗?给我抓住贼
So now,be a good boy,will you?Go catch my thief.

155
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,811
你听清楚了吗?
Are you still here?

156
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,489
如果要安慰你的话
If it's any consolation...

157
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,205
我也有个头
even I have a boss.

158
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,603
你看,Michael,迟早
You see,Michael,sooner or later...

159
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,242
所有人都得为某人服务
everybody has to serve someone.

160
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:35,847
即使你也不例外
Even you.

161
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:44,802
将军
Check.

162
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,566
到手了没有?
Did you get it?

163
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,931
他就等着我去
He was waiting for me.

164
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:55,846
那现在怎么办?
So what now?

165
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,771
接手Sam Richards
Work on Sam Richards.

166
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,163
我会做Maher所要求的 我们去跟其他们交代一下
I'll do what Maher wants.Let's brief the others.

167
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:08,165
Sam Richards现在已经干过moores银行四个分部了
Sam Richards has now hit four branches of Moores Bank.

168
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,926
我们有密报他打算抢伦敦的分公司
We got a tip-off he's due to hit the London branch.

169
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,128
我不明白
I don't get it.

170
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:15,888
- 什么时候开始我们开始抢银行了? - 不是我们.是Richards
- Since when do we rob banks? - We don't.Richards is going to.

171
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,367
那,内容是?
So what's the con?

172
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,604
不管怎样这都会发生 我们只是事后分杯羹
It's going to happen anyway.We just take a slice after the fact.

173
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,526
哦,怎么我听起来还是像抢银行
Well,that still sounds like robbing banks to me.

174
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,446
什么时候开始,我们问去哪里拿钱了??
Since when did we ask where a mark got his money?

175
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,206
如果他已经接受了这件事情 那会给他一个公平的游戏
If it's going down anyway,then it makes him fair game.

176
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:34,252
哦,我们成了附属品了,无论是之前,过程中,还是之后
Yeah,and it makes us accessories before,during,and after the fact.

177
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,087
厨房已经空了,伙计们,我们 需要点成绩,而且要快
The cupboard is bare.Guys,we need a score and we need it fast.

178
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,766
我同意Michael的意见
I'm with Michael.

179
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,683
好吧,那我们知道他多少?
Okay,so what do we know about him?

180
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,571
不多,除了他不喜欢银行
Not much,except that he seems to dislike banks.

181
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,166
谁喜欢呢?
Who doesn't?

182
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,612
那,怎么做?
So what's the in?

183
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,684
他需要一个警报专家
He needs an alarms expert.

184
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,331
我们让Ash做诱饵
We use Ash as the bait.

185
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,085
你对警报系统了解吗?
What do you know about alarms?

186
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,687
- 我无所不知 - 你无所不知?
- I know about everything. - You know about everything?

187
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,003
好吧,既然如此
Okay,if you know about everything...

188
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,449
卢森堡首都是哪里?

191
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,770
你别无聊了,Danny
You're not helping,Danny.

192
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:19,206
不要开始把矛头对准我,小妞 就因为你已经看过我裸体
Don't start having a go at me,girl,just because you've seen me naked.

193
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,207
别问了
Don't ask.

194
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,492
好了,这就是我们要干的
Okay,this is what we do.

195
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:29,046
<i>Richards现在皇家旅馆</i>

<i>一旦他联系上</i>
<i>Once he's made contact...</i>

198
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,522
<i>他把我作为当地的毒贩子介绍给他</i>
<i>he introduces him to me as a local fixer...</i>

199
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,171
<i>我再把他介绍给Ash</i>
<i>and I pass him on to Ash.</i>

200
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,845
Danny和我做什么?
What about Danny and me?

201
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,322
你们两个机动,补空档
We keep you two floating,plug any gaps.

202

206
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,446

00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,809
我只是担心你让他吃亏
I was just concerned you may have been taking advantage of him.

208
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,292
当然
Of course you are.

209
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,772
你能帮我个忙吗?
Can you do something for me?

210
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,413
当然,如果你想的话,我现在就去拿牌

他有麻烦了?
Is he in trouble?

215
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:24,049
只要让他保持忙碌就行了
Just keep him occupied.

216
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,089
- 好的 - 谢了
- Okay. - Thanks.

217
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,401
我不敢相信
I don't believe this.

英国银行税率多少?3.5%?
What is the Bank of England interest rate?3.5%?

219
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,124
他们已经对我的信用卡收了我10倍
They've charged me 10 times this...

220
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:37,091
这卡我一开始就不想要
for a credit card I didn't want in the first place.

221
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,447
这什么?
What's all this?

222
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:52,242
警报装置
Alarms.

223
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,131
- 我以为你了解 - 我是了解,只是有点生锈了（不记得了）
- I thought you knew about alarms. - I do.I'm just a bit rusty.

224
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,169
- 我们可是有时间限制的 - 我知道
- We're on a clock here. - I know.

225
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:01,484
机动?这算什么?
Floating?What's that all about?

226
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,131
你打算抱怨一整天?
Are you going to bitch all day?

227
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,363
Albert,不错,他来做诱饵

我呢?机动人员 对我来说,听起来一无是处
Me?I'm a floater.To me that sounds like a turd.

我们要成为核心人员,是不是,Danny?

所以,那又怎么样?
So what's wrong with that?

234
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,125
你告诉我你不喜欢吗?
You're telling me you don't?

235
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:28,522
- 这是达成一个目的的一条途径 - 什么目的?
- It's a means to an end. - What end?

236
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:34,566
有一天,攒够钱在加勒比海买个小地方 就这样
Saving enough money to buy a small place in the Caribbean one day.That's it.

237
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,723
你是说这只是一份职业?
So you're saying it's just a job to you?

238
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,087
我不是这个意思
I didn't say that.

239
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,731
那你喜欢它吗?
So you love it really?

240
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,771
这重要吗?
Is there any point to this?

241

是的,你知道,这纵容了我
Yes.You know,indulge me.

242
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,848
让我来告诉你 你干吗不告诉我关于你的事情?

00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,964
我在等个人,但他临时爽约了
I was expecting someone,but they've gone AWOL.

250
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:28,689
- 有没有什么我能做的? - 哦不,恐怕不行
- Is there anything I can help you with? - No,I doubt it.

- Danny,你真是个罗曼蒂克老手 - 我说吧...
- Danny,you're an old romantic. - See...

260
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,484
我知道你对此不屑一顾
I knew you'd take the piss.

261
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,766
不,我没有.我发誓
No,I'm not.I promise.

262
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:07,169
我不知道,我只是总想试试身手
I don't know.I just always wanted to try one.

263
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,768
- 看看是什么样的感觉 - 是的,我理解
- See what it'd feel like. - Well,then.

264
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,332
你应该知道

拿我来说吧,我干保险业

00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,803
他妈的肯定有室内工作

抢走了珠宝,没有留下一点指纹
with the family jewels without so much as a footprint.

271
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,253
问题是,我们不仅需要一个警报专家
Trouble was,not only did we need an alarms man...

272
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,563
而且要是一个老手,告诉我们这个怎么做到的
but a crooked one to tell us how it was fixed.

273

极其缺乏职业道德,但非常出色

276
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,483
- 我再给你倒一杯? - 好的

你听得见吗?
Can you hear me?

280
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,812
我马上让它安静下来

284
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:22,188
银行经理在贷款部给我打电话 我破产了!

286
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,526
让我们离开这儿
Let's get out of here.

287
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,406
- 不好意思 - 什么事?
- Excuse me. - Yes?

288
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:30,926
- 你是不是掉了狗? - 是的
- Have you lost a dog? - Yes.

289
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,573
- 我想它可能在那家酒吧里 - 谢谢
- I think he might be in that pub. - Thank you.

290
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:40,123
这是Vincent Cole
This is Vincent Cole.

291
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:42,682
Vincent,这是Sam.Sam Richards
Vincent,this is Sam.Sam Richards.

292
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:46,086
绅士们,我无意冒犯 但我有种强烈的感觉
No offence,gentlemen,but I get the distinct impression...

293
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:48,084
我不会想听到接下来的对话
that I don't want to hear this conversation.

294
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:50,926
- 谢谢,George - 我的荣幸
- Thank you,George. - My very great pleasure.

295
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:58,443
George告诉我,你认得些人能帮我的忙
George tells me you have contacts in a field that I need help with.

296
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,411
- 那方面的? - 警报系统
- Which is? - Alarm systems.

297
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:04,921
你要的帮助是什么?
And what kind of help are you looking for?

298
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,329
- 这个重要吗? - 如果你直说了,这个就不重要
- Does it matter? - Lf you're straight up,no.

299
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,881
如果你是条子,我就需要听听你的解释
But if you're a cop,I need to hear you say the words...

300
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,726
这样,我被捕的时候 能为这个诱捕辩护
so I can plead entrapment when I'm arrested.

301
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,924
好了,我还有其他活儿要干
Okay,I have other things to do.

302
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:18,332
对不起
Sorry.

303
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,885
咖啡,谢谢
Coffee,thanks.

304
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:27,811
我正计划抢个银行
I'm planning to rob a bank.

305
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,645
都计划好了才想起要个搞定警报的?
And a bell man is an afterthought?

306
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,132
我被放鸽子了
I've been let down.

307
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:33,931
我自己可以进入银行
I can get into the bank.

308
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,531
我可以解决外面的保安系统,一路到保险箱
I can deal with the outer security until I get to the vault.

309
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,285
然后,我就需要帮助
That's where I need help.

310
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,607
这是带有视网膜扫描的Locheim系统
It's a Locheim system with retinal scan.

311
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,285
这需要一个专业人员
That needs a specialist.

312
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:47,922
本来我有人可以搞定这个,但他昨晚被捕了
I had a guy lined up,but he was arrested last night.

313
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,483
- 你能不能绕过这个? - 不行
- Can you bypass it? - No.

314
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:54,123
唯一能够绕过这个安全系统的只有Victor Maher
The only one with the security override is Victor Maher.

315
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,091
他是安全部门的头儿
The Head of Security.

316
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,323
好吧,那你打算什么时候干?
Okay,so when are you going in?

317
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,689
- 明晚 - 你的
- Tomorrow night. - Here you go,pal.

318
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:03,246
谢谢
Thanks.

319
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,686
那么?你能助我一臂之力吗?
So?Can you help?

320
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:09,488
不能
No.

321
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,649
但我认识一个人可以
But I know a man who can.

322
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,601
这个小菜一碟
It's a piece of cake.

323
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:21,003
你黑进它的视网膜扫描系统,然后改变它的设置
You hack into the retina scans and reprogram new settings.

324
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,164
新设置是什么?
What are these new settings?

325
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,884
你用自己的视网膜扫描,取代他们的
You take your own scanner,replace their retinal scans with your own.

326
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:29,771
我可以给你这个软件,并在过程中知道你
I can give you the software and talk you through the process.

327
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:32,128
不管怎样,记得两边的扫描
Whatever you do,remember to wipe both scans...

328
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,044
都要在你离开前抹掉
on the computer memory before you leave...

329
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,601
否则,就好像你把自己的指纹留在那
otherwise it's like leaving your fingerprints behind.

330
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,127
等等.两边的扫描?
Hang on.Both scans?

331
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,289
这个Locheim系统在Moores银行刚刚更新过
The Locheim's been updated at Moores.

332
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:44,603
这是一个双重扫描,要两个人,八英尺远同时进行
It's a double scan,two people,eight feet apart.

333
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,571
- 你有多少人? - 一个
- How many in your crew? - One.

334
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,686
- 你单干? - 我一向这样
- You're doing this on your own? - That's how I work.

335
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,003
这个扫描系统是最起码的
The scan's the least of your worries.

336
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,891
你甚至于连血汗钱也拿不出来
You won't even be able to carry the bleeding money out.

337
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,924
我不拿钱
I won't be taking any money out.

338
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:03,333
我父亲吞枪的时候,是47岁
My dad was 47 when he took a shotgun...

339
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,485
<i>放在他的下巴下面 然后扣动了扳机</i>
<i>placed it under his chin and pulled the trigger.</i>

340
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:11,769
他继承我祖父的事业 经营一个小型钻石切割公司
He ran a small diamond-cutting business started by my great-grandfather.

341
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,172
我父亲接过公司的时候
By the time Dad took over...

342
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,130
许多大公司都在买新机器
bigger companies were buying new machines...

343
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,169
做的更快,更便宜
making stones quicker,cheaper.

344
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,483
于是他借了笔款子以维持经营
So he took out a loan to keep afloat.

345
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,611
当银行催他还款的时候
When the bank called the loan in...

346
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,968
他觉得他令整个家族失望
he felt he let down his entire family.

347
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,324
他羞愧的无法面对我们
He was too ashamed to face us.

348
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,252
是Moores银行吗?
Moores Bank?

349
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,245
他们是毒瘤
They're a cancer.

350
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,602
- 地方恶霸 - 怎么?所以你要报复?
- Playground bullies. - What?So this is revenge?

351
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:36,844
你知道,亲眼看着自己父亲死是什么感受吗?
Have you any idea what it's like to watch your father die?

352
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:38,692
眼睁睁看着整个家
Watch your whole family...

353
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,845
你熟悉和深爱的刹那间消失
everything you've ever known and loved disintegrate in a second?

354
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:45,369
他只想本本分分的,你懂吗?
All he ever wanted to do was play it straight,you know?

355
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,452
循规蹈矩的
Toe the line.

356
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,089
我知道这听上去有点蠢
I know this sounds stupid...

357
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,843
但这个与钱无关
but this isn't about the money.

358
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,482
继续说
Go on.

359
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:59,612
20年代的时候,我祖父买了块石头
In the '20s,my grandfather bought a stone.

360
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,252
还未经雕琢
Still uncut...

361
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,405
但当时仍价值25万镑
but even then it must have been worth 250,000.

362
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,161
银行用它来低偿了我父亲的债
The bank took it to recoup my dad's loan.

363
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,409
但却并没有把它进行拍卖
But instead of putting it up for auction...

364
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,405
而是占为己有,一笔勾销了债务
they kept it for themselves and wrote off the loan.

365
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,769
而我们的债务是4万镑
That loan was 40,000.

366
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:24,653
现在,我已经拿回了他们偷走的每一分
I've taken back every penny that they stole...

367
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,645
并尽我所能的大肆破坏
and caused as much damage as I could in the process.

368
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,204
但现在,我要拿回钻石
But now I'm gonna get the diamond.

369
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,647
就这样.然后走人
Then that's it.Then it's over.

370
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,249
保险箱里面就是这个?
And that's what's in the vault?

371
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,972
是的.但明天,他们就会换地方
Yeah.But they're moving it the day after tomorrow.

372
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:43,328
这就是为什么我迫不及待现在就要干
That's why I have to do this now.

373
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:48,884
除非,你所说的 他们警报系统已经更新是真的
Only,if what you say about them updating the alarm is true...

374
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,770
我就不能单干了
I can't do it on my own.

375
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,883
<i>你知道,亲眼看着自己父亲死是什么感受吗?</i>
<i>Have you any idea what it's like to watch your father die?</i>

376
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,611
<i>眼睁睁看着整个家</i>
<i>Watch your whole family...</i>

377
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:16,129
<i>你所熟悉和深爱的刹那间消失</i>
<i>everything you've ever known and loved disintegrate in a second?</i>

378
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:20,047
<i>我父亲准时工作,吃饭,睡觉</i>
<i>My dad worked,ate,and slept.</i>

379
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,567
<i>纳税,循规蹈矩</i>
<i>Paid his taxes on time,toed the line.</i>

380
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:26,204
<i>他唯一的梦想就是好好退休</i>
<i>The only dream he had was retiring.</i>

381
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:30,288
<i>他一直工作到死 他60岁生日前三天</i>
<i>Worked himself to death three days before his 60th birthday.</i>

382
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:33,488
<i>每个人都得服从于某人</i>
<i>Everybody has to serve someone.</i>

383
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:36,201
<i>即使是你</i>
<i>Even you.</i>

384
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,848
哦,我的天哪,你接得住吗?
Oh,my God,can you take a chip?

385
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,283
- 来吧 - 接住咯
- Come on. - Bingo.

386
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,721
嗨
Hello.

387
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:46,925
你之前结过婚,对吧?
You were married before this,right?

388
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:50,085
这就是为什么我会过现在这种生活 他是个不起眼的骗子
That's how I got into the life.He was a smalltime hustler.

389
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:52,129
我扮演妓女,找猎物
I'd play a whore,pick up a mark...

390
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,647
Jake就冲进来 以一个生气的皮条客或男朋友的身份
Jake would burst in as the irate pimp or boyfriend...

391
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,770
- 然后以他们的妻子相要挟 - 很漂亮,不是吗?
- and threaten to tell their wives. - Classy,isn't it?

392
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:01,323
我想,我们会有未来
I thought we were building a future.

393
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:04,044
然后,五年前
Then five years ago...

394
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,250
他卷跑了我们所有的钱,跑得无影无踪
he cleared out all our savings and he disappeared.

395
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,289
你那之后见过他吗?
You ever seen him since?

396
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,646
你想他吗?
Do you miss him?

397
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,962
当然,有一段时间,是的
Of course I did for a while,yeah...

398
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:18,850
但不会了,再也不会了
but no,not anymore.

399
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:22,409
我甚至于不再为此生气 生活就这么回事
I'm not even angry anymore.Things are what they are.

400
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:26,643
那Mickey是怎么卷进来的?
So where does Mickey fit into all this?

401
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,491
Jake离开的时候,是他帮了我
He helped me out when Jake left.

402
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,848
你以前就认识他了,是不是?
You knew him before,though,right?

403
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,321
- 我们能不能说点儿别的? - 随你便
- Can we talk about something else? - Lf you want.

404
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:43,372
那么
What about...

405
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,250
你和我怎么样?
What about you and me?

406
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:49,932
我们怎么样?
What about us?

407
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,049
我并不了解你
I don't know about you,okay...

408
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,764
但我今天过得很开心
but I really enjoyed today.

409
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,086
是的,很开心
Yeah,it was fun.

410
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:01,729
我有种感觉,你想和我在一起
I just got the feeling that you wanted to be with me.

411
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:11,165
你知道,我喜欢你
You know I like you.

412
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,766
等等,伙计
Down,boy.

413
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,364
我知道你也喜欢我
I know you like me,too.

414
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,643
我承认 当你不那么讨厌的时候
I must say,when you're not being obnoxious...

415
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,928
你真的很讨人喜欢
you can be really quite sweet.

416
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:24,488
所以?
So?

417
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,767
- 你怎么想? - 对不起,我不能
- How was it for you? - Sorry.I can't.

418
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,807
- 什么叫你不能? - 好吧,我不想!
- What do you mean,you can't? - All right.I won't!

419
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:02,646
我曾经跟你讲过 我不跟在一起工作的人搞不清楚
I told you once before,I don't screw people I work with.

420
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,008
所有人?还是只有我?
People?Or is it just me?

421
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:13,007
什么让他这么特别了?
What makes him so special?

422
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,212
- 怎么回事? - 没什么
- What's going on? - Nothing.

423
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,124
- Danny? - 别问我
- Danny? - Don't ask me.

424
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:26,885
我只是机动人员
I'm just floating.

425
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,651
<i>有人要见你</i>
<i>Someone to see you.</i>

426
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,010
<i>Albert Stroller</i>
<i>Albert Stroller.</i>

430
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,883
<i>你看上去不错 是么,谢谢</i>
<i>- You're looking well. - Why,thank you.</i>

431
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,851
<i>你看上去混的不错</i>
<i>You look as though you're doing pretty well yourself.</i>

432
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:29,410
你去见Maher了.他给了我这个
You went to see Maher.He sent me this.

433
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:32,446
他录了下来,我倒不知道
He taped it.I didn't see that coming.

434
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,842
你求他离我远点
You begged him to leave me alone.

435
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,604
我没有求他,我要求他
I didn't beg him,I asked.

436
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:40,491
你凭什么觉得我需要你或其他人的保护?
What makes you think I need yours or anyone else's protection?

437
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,291
你根本没有意识到,你将陷入什么局面
You've no idea what you're getting into.

438
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:45,445
- 我在使Danny免除牢狱之灾 - 而你却正在把你自己迁进去
- I'm keeping Danny out of prison. - You're putting yourself back in.

439
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,127
- 什么? - 坐下来
- What? - Sit down.

440
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,644
收起你的骄傲,坐下
Swallow your pride and sit down.

441
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:03,206
现在,好好想想
Now think.

442
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,766
是的,我当然会
Yes,of course I am.

443
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,566
不,先生 我明白了,先生
No,sir.I understand,sir.

444
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:12,247
Richards使Maher的银行遭殃
Richards has been plaguing Maher's bank.

445
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,449
他袭击了四个城市的分部
He's hit branches in four other cities.

446
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,922
根本没法抓住他
They haven't even come close to catching him.

447
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,810
这令他疯狂
It's driving him mad.

448
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:33,088
<i>他跟他以前部门里的老朋友出去喝酒</i>
<i>He goes for a beer with some of his old friends from the Fraud Squad...</i>

449
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:36,131
<i>而他充耳所闻的都是你</i>
<i>and all he hears about is you.</i>

450
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,444
他要你来抓住Richards
He set you up to catch Richards.

451
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:40,722
为什么?
Why?

452
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,085
来证明他自己
To prove he can.

453
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,721
又自大了
There's that ego again.

454
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,969
他让我来抓Richards
He set me up to catch Richards...

455
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,125
是要我们在同一个地方
to put us in the same place.

456
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:56,885
他为什么要这么干?
And why would he do that?

457
00:32:57,493 --> 00:32:58,926
为了
To...

458
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,211
告诉我你没有（打算跟他在一块）
Please tell me you haven't.

459
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:05,568
我要跟Sam一块进保险箱
I'm going into the vault with Sam.

460
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:09,566
- 因为? - 他的父亲
- Because? - His father...

461
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:11,926
说来话长
It's a long story.

462
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,330
我相信那儿有个受伤滴血的心灵
I'm sure there's a bleeding heart in there somewhere.

463
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:18,731
而且我肯定Maher知道你会这么干
And I guarantee that Maher knew that's what you'd do.

464
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,645
我这么容易看透?
Am I that predictable?

465
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,451
他利用了你弱点
He plays to your weaknesses.

466
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,251
他让你们两个身处一块儿
He gets you both in the same place...

467
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,131
断了你们的后路 然后他就报警
he leaves you no way out,then he calls the police.

468
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,568
然后他得到他想要的
Then he gets what he desires most.

469
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:33,692
胜过Mickey Bricks
To be the man who outsmarted Mickey Bricks.

470
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,561
Danny不用进牢里,而你进去了
Danny stays out of prison and you go down instead.

471
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,450
你告诉我总归有办法的
You taught me there was always a way out.

472
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,445
因为我从来没有想到你会中Victor Maher的奸计
Because I never thought you'd run into Victor Maher.

473
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:47,531
他诱导你进这个游戏 耍得你团团转
He lures you into the game,plays you like a violin.

474
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,727
他找的每个骗子都犯了同一个错误
Every grifter he's sent away made the same mistake:

475
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:53,691
他们都觉得自己比他有心计
They all thought that they could outthink him.

476
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:56,045
但他们没有
But they couldn't.

477
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,370
我把你当儿子看待
I love you like a son...

478
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,888
但我也不觉得你斗得过他
but I don't think you could,either.

479
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,369
- 你要玩吗? - 不,我要赢
- You want to play? - No,I want to win.

480
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,252
我放弃
I give up.

481
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:22,927
帮帮我?
Help me?

482
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,042
好吧
Okay.

483
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:34,406
什么令你坚强?
What makes you strong?

484
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:36,643
我所知道的和你所教我的
What I know,what you taught me.

485
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:37,961
这不够
That's not enough.

486
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,123
他打败了我,记得吗?
He beat me,remember?

487
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:42,648
其他人
The others.

488
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,086
他们怎么想?
And where are they?

489
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:47,131
<i>Ash一无所知,在问为什么</i>
<i>Ash doesn't know anything,wonders why.</i>

490
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,364
<i>他认为你不信任他</i>
<i>He thinks you don't trust him.</i>

491
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,564
<i>Stacie非常聪明</i>
<i>Stacie's bright as a button...</i>

492
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:56,962
<i>是你最忠实的队友</i>
<i>the best ally you've ever had.</i>

493
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,329
<i>你有问过她的意见吗</i>
<i>Have you asked her advice?</i>

494
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:06,526
<i>还有Danny的骗术天分 有一天甚至于超过你</i>
<i>And Danny's grift sense could put even you in the shade one day.</i>

495
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,366
你有没有重用过他?
Have you used him?

496
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,408
没有,为什么不?
No.And why not?

497
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,325
因为你太骄傲了,开不了口
Because you're too proud to ask.

498
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:19,088
你觉得,全世界只要你一肩扛起就好了
You think the whole world is better off resting on your shoulders.

499
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,771
你很聪明
You've got a good brain.

500
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:24,922
好好想想
Use it.

501
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,123
你俩怎么不说话了?
You two not talking,then?

502
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:41,051
他不可理喻
He's impossible.

503
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:44,929
所以你是因为他是Danny而生他的气?
So you're angry with Danny for being Danny?

504
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,522
对不起
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,211
没什么的
Don't worry about it.

506
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:15,248
说真的
I mean it.

507
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:19,049
我今天真的很开心
And I really did enjoy today.

508
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:27,003
Stacie,Mickey找你
Stacie,Mickey wants you.

509
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:35,406
所以你全知道,而把我蒙在鼓里?
So you knew all this and never said a word to me?

510
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,053
是我不对Danny.对不起
That was wrong,Danny.I'm sorry.

511
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:41,364
现在你们都知道了 我们是最强的团队
And that goes for all of you.We're strongest as a team.

512
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:43,572
而我却忘记了
I tend to forget that.

513
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,087
所以,如果你不搞定这个人 Danny就要进监狱
So if you don't set this guy up,Danny goes to prison.

514
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:47,686
而如果你做了,你就要进监狱?
And if you do,you go instead?

515
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:48,842
就是这样
That's about it.

516
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,161
这真是笔好买卖
That's a good deal.

517
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,005
我们现在是不是都漏了重点?
Aren't we all missing the point now?

518
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:55,642
- 什么? - 我走,问题就解决了
- Which is? - Lf I go away,so does the problem.

519
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,007
这不是选择
That's not an option.

520
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:59,402
出于整个家族 三个火枪手的故事
Because of the whole family,musketeer thing.

521
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:01,723
听着,我是新人,我会让你摆脱这个
Listen,I'm the new kid.I'll let you off that.

522
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,929
不,因为那意味着他击败了我们
No,because it means he'll have beaten us.

523
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,527
一直到那家伙打开保险箱,你才能拿到带子?
You don't get the tape till this guy's opened the vault?

524
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:07,602
是的
Right.

525
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,763
而少任何一个,保险箱都打不开
And he can't open the vault without one of us.

526
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,968
没错
Right,too.

527
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,203
一定程度上,你俩拴在一个绳子上
At which point you both get a tug.

528
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,692
我不觉得我们有胜算
I don't see how we can win.

529
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,333
如果我们进去了 你能不能从别的路走?
If we get you inside,can we get you out another way?

530
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,165
不行,原路进去,原路返回
No,there's one way in,one way out.

531
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,766
就像那个
It's like one of them things.

532
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,208
三个笨蛋花4个小时挖一个洞
It takes three blokes four hours to dig a hole.

533
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:27,047
如果6个人挖一个小点的洞要多久?
How long does it take six men to dig a smaller hole?

534
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,012
算了吧Danny
Shut up,Danny.

535
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,369
问题是,我们有没有其他主意?
The question is,do we have any ideas?

536
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,849
我从来没这么高兴过
I don't think I've ever had so much fun.

537
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,367
我很高兴我能帮上忙
I'm glad to have been of service.

538
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,286
一直到胖女人唱歌,才会结束
It ain't all over till the fat lady sings.

539
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,563
你打击我要我放弃吗
Don't you disappoint me by giving up.

540
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,687
你给我的选择太苛刻
The options you've left me are rather limited.

541
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,683
我没有给你任何选择
I haven't left you any options.

542
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,770
就这么回事
That's how this thing works.

543
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,050
那么,什么时候?
So,when?

544
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,445
- 今晚 - 怎么做?
- Tonight. - How?

545
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:10,890
他会黑入主机 然后改变视网膜扫描
He's hacking into the mainframe and resetting the retina scans.

546
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,167
很聪明
Clever.

547
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:13,845
但有个问题
But there's a problem.

548
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:16,283
- 这要两个人 - 不
- It takes two people. - No.

549
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,885
你做什么?
What are you going to do?

550
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,251
我和他一起进去
I'm going in with him.

551
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,282
但你早就知道了,是不是?
But you already knew that,didn't you?

552
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:26,523
这好像是逻辑问题
Seemed like the logical thing.

553
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,772
Albert会在场,把带子交给他
Albert will be there.Give him the tape.

554
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,812
当我看到你的脸出现在sam边上 而且保险箱打开的时候
When I see your face next to Sam's,and the vault door open.

555
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:43,327
看着警报在你们周围响一定很有意思
It's been a pleasure running rings round you.

556
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,407
银行
The bank.

557
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:16,567
Stacie,你和Danny 进行第一阶段
Stacie,you and Danny go and set up the first phase.

558
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:23,525
我们需要见这里的老板
We'd like to see the manager,please.

559
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,649
我能问问这个连接什么的?
Can I ask what it's in connection with?

560
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,882
警察
Police.

561
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:30,848
接下来Albert
Albert next.

562
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:32,969
他们知道他是谁 所以我们需要一个掩护
They know who he is,so we'll need a disguise.

563
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:35,726
Peregrin B.Winterhill三世,我想
Peregrin B.Winterhill III,I think.

564
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:36,962
很好
Perfect.

565
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:40,170
这个提供机会让我和sam进去
That should provide enough of a diversion for me and Sam to get in.

566
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,721
我去拿东西,到那儿碰头,Danny
I'll pick up the materials and meet you there,Danny.

567
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,485
你能准备份礼物吗?
Can you sort out the present?

568
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,724
好了,干吧
Okay,let's do it.

569
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,806
哦,我的天哪 我太尴尬了,你知道
Oh,my God,I'm so embarrassed,you know.

570
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,804
对不起,我弯不下来
I'm sorry,I can't bend over.

571
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,445
好了,第二步
Right,phase two.

572
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:01,246
有两个门 Mickey搞定锁
Two gates at the side.Mickey will take care of the locks.

573
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,846
会把你引向这扇门
Which will bring you to this door.

574
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:05,970
到那时,Albert会去见Maher
By that time,Albert will just be arriving to meet Maher.

575
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,567
这时候,所有人都要就位
You guys should be in position by this time.

576
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:12,805
如果Maher真的如Albert所说的那么聪明 他很快就会发现
If Maher's as smart as Albert says he is,it won't take him long to figure it out.
