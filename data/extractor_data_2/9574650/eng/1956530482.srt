<font color="cyan">when someone's very important</font>

295
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,720
<font color="cyan">and you haven't seen them</font>
<font color="cyan">for a long time,</font>

296
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,800
<font color="cyan">as soon as you do,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's easier to breathe.</font>

297
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,960
<font color="yellow"># Was mine alone</font>

298
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,080
<font color="yellow"># If I had your heart</font>

299
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,520
<font color="yellow"># To call my own</font>

300
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,280
<font color="yellow"># This would make me happy</font>

301
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,440
<font color="yellow"># And I'll be</font>

302
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,960
<font color="yellow"># I'll be satisfied... #</font>

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
<font color="cyan">I wanted to go and talk to her.</font>

304
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,080
<font color="cyan">But then I realised that it was OK</font>
<font color="cyan">if I just watched her.</font>

305
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,880
<font color="cyan">Watched out for her.</font>

306
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,080
<font color="cyan">Because you have to be vigilant</font>
<font color="cyan">with people.</font>

307
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
<font color="cyan">And I hadn't been.</font>

308
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,000
<font color="cyan">Alyssa was my only person left.</font>

309
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,480
<font color="yellow"># Like I'm loving you</font>

310
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,120
<font color="yellow"># And this would make me happy</font>

311
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,920
<font color="yellow"># And I'll never</font>

312
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
<font color="yellow"># No, I'll never let you go</font>

313
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
<font color="yellow"># Now, I don't believe... #</font>

314
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,040
<font color="cyan">Shit. Shit.</font>

315
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,680
<font color="cyan">Shit, shit, shit.</font>
<font color="white">CAR ENGINE SPLUTTERS</font>

316
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
<font color="cyan">Shit.</font>

317
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,400
<font color="yellow"># But sometimes, sometimes</font>

318
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,040
<font color="yellow"># A dream will come true... #</font>

319
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
<font color="white">Oi!</font>

320
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,080
<font color="yellow"># And if faith, if faith alone</font>

321
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,000
<font color="yellow"># Can move a mountain... #</font>

322
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,320
<font color="white">Who are you?</font>

323
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
<font color="yellow"># What's to keep me</font>

324
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
<font color="yellow"># From having you?</font>

325
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
<font color="white">Oh, my God.</font>

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
<font color="cyan">Hey.</font>

327
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,880
<font color="white">For fuck's sake.</font>

328
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,960
<font color="yellow"># I do believe</font>

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,280
<font color="yellow"># I could win your love</font>

330
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,840
<font color="yellow"># And this would make me happy</font>

331
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,560
<font color="yellow"># And I know that you</font>

332
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,520
<font color="yellow"># Would be happy, too</font>

333
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,040
<font color="yellow"># Yeah</font>

334
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,720
<font color="yellow"># Yeah, yeah. #</font>
