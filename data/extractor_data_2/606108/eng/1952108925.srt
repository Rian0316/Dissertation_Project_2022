OLDER TED: Kids,
before I met your mother,

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,520
when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,289
That love is not a science.

4
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,958
- Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
- SON: We're gonna go watch TV.

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,427
OLDER TED: You see, sometimes in life...

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,163
you just have to accept
that certain things can't be explained,

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,388
and that's kind of scary.

8
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,236
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I'm still shaking.

9
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,072
What the... Joke's on you. I have a cold.

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,507
Are you guys okay?

11
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,275
Another round,
and back it up for me and Lily!

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,510
What happened?

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,370
- We saw something, up in the apartment.
- Something bad.

but margaritas make me sexy.

(LILY SCREAMING)

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,136
What was it?

20
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,440
Only the craziest, meanest-Iooking mouse
you've ever seen.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,345
Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.

22
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,914
Baby, it was a mouse. It had whiskers.

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,050
What, those things coming out
of his head? Those were antennae.

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,787
- Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
- It was a mouse.

25
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,690
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,394
My story's on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.

Everything in life can be broken down
to ones and zeros, even love.

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,279
All I have to do is input
the variables, run the algorithm,

33
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,283
and presto manifesto,
you have a soul mate and it works!

34
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,511
Just ask all of my happy couples.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,922
(WHISPERING) And these are just
the attractive ones.

36

41

- Yes.
- We're signing up.

42
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,670
- What?
- Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,108
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.

44
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,345
I'm not going to a matchmaker.
That's like giving up.

45
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,747
It's the man version of getting a cat.

46
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,718
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur.
And only mammals have fur.

47
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,919
It was a cockroach.

48
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,288
Come on, Lily.
The only way that that was a cockroach...

49
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:39,526
is if it was wearing the skin
of a mouse it just killed.

50
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,626
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,595

You got to help me, my boat is sinking.

00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,045
- What?
- My boat is sinking!

56
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,613
- You have a boat?
- Yes, I bought a boat last year...

57
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,216
at a police auction. I just got a call
from a guy down at the marina...

58
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,784
that it's leaning starboard
at a 45-degree angle.

59
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:10,123
If I don't get down there right now
it's gonna capsize! Now come on!

60
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,826
Your boat is sinking. That was good.

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,929
Come on.
Ted, this is an incredible opportunity.

62
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:21,384
We'll meet our soul mates, nail them,
and never call them again.

63
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,570
All finished, gentlemen?

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,773
Congratulations, you have just taken
your very first step.

65
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,976
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.

66
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,981
I'm so done with the single life.
All the games, the meaningless sex.

67
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,081
You deserve more.

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,716
That is so true, Ellen.

69
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:45,358
I really think I'm ready to stop
being a me, and start being a we.

70
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,228
Hey, is there any way I can
let it be known that I love cuddling?

71
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,889
Oh, of course you... That is so...

72
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,504
It's kind of hard to taIk about with Ted here,

73
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,542
but I just want someone who's not afraid
to hold me at night,

74
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,642
when the tears come.

75
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,181
Ellen, can you help me find her?

76
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,281
- Get out.
- What?

77
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,786
I get 15 guys like you every week.

78
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,055
Jerks who just wanna meet
vulnerable women,

79
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,158
nail them, and never call them again.

80
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,326
Oh, my God, people do that?

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,629
Do you wanna do this the easy way,
or the hard way?

82
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,032
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

83
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,901
No, that's the easy way.

84
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,304
The hard way is that I stomp the crap
out of you myself.

85
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,974
- Okay, Ted, let's go.
- Not you. You stay.

86
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,410
You're cute.

87
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,013
You're an architect. Good career.

88
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,815
And you didn't use an obvious alias
on your application...

89
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,635
like your friend 'Jack Package.'

90
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,825
- It's pronounced Puh-kaj.
- Get out of here!

91
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,891
You, I can work with.

92
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:57,431
You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.

93
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,601
No, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

94
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,971
It's New York City.
You know, plenty of fish in the sea.

95
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,562
Plenty of fish in the sea.

96
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,842
Yes, there's nine million people
in New York,

97
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,001
4.5 million women.

98
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,581
Of course, you wanna meet somebody
roughly your own age,

99
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,716
let's say, plus-minus five years.

100
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,319
So if we take into account
the most recent census data,

101
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,354
that leaves us with 482,000.

102
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,925
But wait, 48% of those
are already in relationships,

103
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,895
and then you have to eliminate half
for intelligence, sense of humor...

104
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,063
and compatibility.

105
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,966
And then you have to take out
the ex-girlfriends, and the relatives...

106
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,134
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

107
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,933
And then that leaves us with eight women.

108
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,211
That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?

109
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,649
There are eight fish
in that big, blue ocean, Ted.

110
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,819
And if you feel confident
that you could reel one into your boat...

111
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,384
without me, there's the door.

112
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,980
Do you take credit cards?

113
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,596
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got a good look.

114
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,466
Hey. Seriously,
you have to stop doing that!

115
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,541
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

116
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,673
We were just upstairs watching TV.

117
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,773
Oh, gosh.

118
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,442
(GASPS)

119
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,350
Okay. Let's do this.

120
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,560
(SCREAMING)...

121
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,162
(SHUSHING)

122
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,355
It's okay. It's over.

123
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,832
(EXCLAIMS)...

124
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,678
- So, did you get a good look at it?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,010
It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton,
like a roach.

126
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,785
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

127
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,487
Gray-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

128
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,902
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

129
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,426
It's a cockamouse.

130
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,097
What?

131
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,100
It's some sort of mutant combination
of the two.

132
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,159
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,
you know...

133
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,108
Did the horizontal, 10-legged,
inter-species cha-cha?

134
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,011
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.

135
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,479
- But it can.
- And it has.

136
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
And it's pissed.

137
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,552
Dude, is everything okay?
You left the front door open.

138
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,652
There was no time.

139
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,058
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?

140
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,562
She said it'd take three days.
It's been five days.

141
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,663
Should I be worried?

142
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,133
Just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

143
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,936
Did you just use my name as a verb?

144
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,305
Yeah, we do that behind your back.

145
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,240
Ted out. To overthink.

146
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Also see, Ted up.

147
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,212
Ted up, to overthink something
with disastrous results.

148
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,781
Sample sentence,
Billy Teded up when he tried to...

149
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,881
Okay. I get it.

150
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,587
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
Ted anything up, or out.

151
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,492
I should give it a few more days.

152
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,891
- Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
- Ted. Hi.

153
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,429
I meant to call you.

154
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,798
The computer is still crunching
the numbers.

155
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,867
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

156
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,535
You said it was gonna be three days.

157
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,337
Did I? Three days.

158
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,438
- Really?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,541
When someone says you're gonna meet
the perfect woman in three days,

160
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,344
you kind of put that in your datebook. So.

161
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,248
How do I say this?
This is gonna be really hard.

162
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,768
Ted, there are absolutely no women
out there for you.

163
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,676
Actually, I got through that okay.

164
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,396
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

165
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,899
I know. There's supposed to be.
I don't know where they are.

166
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,535
But I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.

167
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,904
- I'm a cute architect.
- How do you think I feel?

168
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,667
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook!

169
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,177
I could maybe find somebody for you
if you were gay.

170
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,812
- Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?

171
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,912
No!

172
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:12,118
- You're messing with me, right?
- Come see for yourself.

173
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,243
I cannot set you up...

174
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,391
unless you have a compatibility rating
of 7.0 or higher. And look.

175
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,324
5.4, 4.8, 5.6...

176
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,129
There's a 9.6 right there.

177
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,354
Don't touch the computer.

178
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,435
Yes. Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.

179
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,938
She would've been
absolutely perfect for you.

180
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,107
Well, what about the guy you set her
up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

181
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,076
- 8.5.
- So he sucks!

182
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,086
No, 8.5 is an extremely good
match-up quotient.

183
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,240
Sure it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?

184
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,261
9.6 is off the charts.
But Sarah is matched up.

185
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:53,087
Ted, look. I have lunch. Please.

186
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,796
I promise we will find you somebody.
Don't lose hope.

187
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,296
There are new women turning 18
every day.

188
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,097
It's a whole new species. The cockamouse.

189
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,633
And it's the size of a potato.

190
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,200
So, what now, it's a cockapotatomouse?

191
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,210
Don't make it sound ridiculous.
It's a cockamouse!

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,280
My God, this is incredible!
We're like the same person.

193
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,983
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.
She wants to have two children.

194
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,420
Her guilty-pleasure song
<i>is Summer Breezeby Seals and Croft.</i>

195
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,430
Wow, Ted.
Sounds like you're her perfect woman.

196
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,695
And like the majestic seahorse,
it's hermaphroditic.

197
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,399
Obviously, the whole thing
is shrouded in mystery.

198
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,834
For as much as we know
about the cockamouse,

199
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,771
there is still so much we don't know.

200
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,041
Well, we know that there is no such thing
as the cockamouse.

201
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,011
What we don't know
is what you guys have been smoking.

202
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,280
So you really don't believe
in the cockamouse?

203
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,183
Well, I believe that you saw
something perfectly normal,

204
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:30,743
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,
you know, like the Loch Ness monster.

205
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,828
If by 'like the Loch Ness monster'
you mean 'totally exists and is awesome,'

206
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,332
then, yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.

207
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,568
Its diet is not unlike our own.
Grains, cereals,

208
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,471
- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
- Okay. This is getting weird.

209
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,039
The similarities go on and on.

210
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,810
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.

211
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,679
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

212
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,649
You want to be her boyfriend.
She already has a boyfriend.

213
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,377
- It's uncanny.
- All right.

214
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,153
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?

215
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,091
See what my 9.6 looks like in person,
as, you know, a frame of reference.

216
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,462
And if she thinks she can do
11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

I just wanted to say my job, too.

- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Hi.

221
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,978
So, what are we doing today?

222
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,714
Right, I have a kind of mole on my back.

223
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,950
It's probably nothing.
But I'm a cautious guy.

224
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,050

- I love brunch.

It's the best.

But it'll definitely sound more weird...

234
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,393
once my shirt's off,
so I'm gonna ask you now.

235
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,697
Do you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

236
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:23,152
That's very sweet, but I'm actually
getting married on Saturday.

238
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,478
Wow. You're getting married.
Congratulations.

239
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,047
- Thank you.
- I'm really sorry I asked you out.

240
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,017
It just felt like there could
be this weird connection between us.

241
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,387
- How crazy am I coming off here?
- Only a little.

242
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,025
Well, by some million-to-one long shot,
and I'm not rooting for this,

00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,396
you wind up not getting married
this weekend, give me a call.

244
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,171
Okay. But it's not likely.

00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:36,418
Brace yourself, dude.
This is gonna blow your mind-hole.

329
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,054
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.

330
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,154
- What?
- It's empty.

331
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,210
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...

332
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,629
Lily!

333
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,633
- Robin!
- What?

334
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,733
(EXCLAIMING)...

335
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,137
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)...

336
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:03,140
- Oh, my God! It's real!
- No, is it? Do something!

337
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,749
No! What the hell was that?
You trying to get it drunk?

338
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,218
It was the only thing I could think of!

339
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,318
Lily! Thank God!

340
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,190
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN PANIC)

341
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,290
Lily, I love you!

342
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,753
Robin, open the window!

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,928
(SCREAMING)

344
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,294
Please, for the love of God,
open the window!

345
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,537
(WINGS FLAPPING)

346
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,637
It can fly.

347
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,406
ALL: Wow.

348
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,747
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.

349
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,615
I grew to admire your tenacious...

350
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,751
Holy mother of God! It's headed this way!

351
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,851
Close the window!

352
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,494
Hi, Ellen.

353
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,462
I think I want my money back.

354
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,705
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, Ted.

355
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,642
I widened the search parameters,
I tweaked the program.

356
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,713
Last night, I stood out on the street
for five hours...

357
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,484
showing your photo
to random pedestrians. No takers.

358
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,287
Although this transvestite hooker said
he/she would do you for half price...

359
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,989
because you kind of look
like John Cusack...

360
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,914
and his/her favorite movie was
<i>Say Anything...</i>

361
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,530
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of
ice cream. Isn't that a bit cliché?

362
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,630
It's for the bourbon.

363
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,035
This isn't hopeless.
You're gonna find someone for me.

364
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,696
No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.

365
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:45,744
I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me.
I'm bright. I'm attractive.

366
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,679
You just gotta get back out there
and keep looking.

367
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,681
No. You're never gonna find anybody.

368
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,218
And every year, you're just getting
older and it's getting harder and harder.

369
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,255
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be
up on that wall one of these days.

370
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,757
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

371
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,937
- How do you know?
- I don't know, but I believe.

372
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,231
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
can find love in this crazy city,

373
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,066
then damn it, so can I!

374
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,166
You're losing me.

375
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,071
The point is,
something good's gonna happen to me.

376
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:18,844
I mean, maybe your computer will help,
maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

377
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,048
- So I should keep looking?
- Of course you should.

378
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,549
And now, you're gonna do it for free.
