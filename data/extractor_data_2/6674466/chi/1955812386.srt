1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,720
太空是灵魂的镜子
Space is the mirror of the soul.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,960
我们是在向外看  还是在向里看呢
Are we looking beyond, or are we looking within?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,720
我在看我的鞋
I'm looking at my shoes.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,130
这说得我尴尬症犯了
This is making me a little motion sick.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,330
当我们注视着无垠的太空时
When we gaze out at the immensities of space,

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,300
我们能够理解  是因为我们的内心
we understand them because there are immensities

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,330
也是无限宽广的
within us as well.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,870
我是拉杰什・库萨帕里博士
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,110
谢谢你们和我一起在
and thank you for taking a walk with me...

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,780
繁星中漫步
through the stars.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,610
这个停顿每次都长一点
That pause gets longer every show.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,650
我相信
I believe...

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,280
你是对的
you're right.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,850
嗨
Hey.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,050
我能和你合个影吗
Can I get a picture with you?

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,120
当然
Absolutely.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,220
如果你要发到社交网站的话
And if you post it on social media,

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,060
我建议你加上标签  帕里诗人
I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet."

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,030
谢谢你  这个节目真精彩
Thank you. The show was great.

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,230
我不能把功劳全占了
Well, I can't take all the credit.

21
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,900
和我一起表演的明星也很棒
I have pretty good co-stars.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,700
真  明星
The stars.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,540
这话你跟所有人都说吗
Do you say that to everyone?

24
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,940
只有漂亮的姑娘
Only to beautiful women.

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,940
还有还行的姑娘
And okay women.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,580
行
Okay.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,150
哦  澄清一下  你是第一种
Uh, just to clarify: you're the first kind.

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,480
好吧
Okay.

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,850
谢谢你们来
Thanks for coming.

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,020
你们两位帅哥觉得节目怎么样啊
What did you handsome gentlemen think of the show?

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,590
你可以不用这样说话了
Uh, you can turn it off now.

32
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,630
你这样说很贴心  但我觉得我停不下来
It's sweet of you to say, but I don't think I can.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,150
看看这张哈雷洗澡的可爱照片
Look at this cute picture of Halley in the bath.

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,550
嗷  真漂亮
Aw, that's great.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,160
我发给你呗
Want me to send it to you?

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,030
不用  在你手机上叫可爱  在我手机上叫犯罪
No, on your phone it's cute, on my phone it's a crime.

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,030
我也有一张漂亮照片给大家看
I also have a pretty cute picture to share.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,360
是啥
What is that?

39
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,870
一个方程
An equation.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,870
很棒吧
Isn't it perfect?

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,700
有的时候我就盯着它
Sometimes I just stare at it,

42
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,570
我想  真不敢相信这是我生出来的
and I think "I can't believe that came out of me."

43
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,910
既然我们在分享照片
Well, since we're sharing pictures,

44
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,880
我也要贡献一张
I have one to contribute.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,850
请不要是你和你的狗在洗澡
Please don't let it be you and your dog in the bathtub.

46
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,720
不是
It's not.

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
不过不要往下翻
But don't swipe.

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,090
这是啥啊
What are we looking at here?

49
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,420
这是我和一个漂亮姑娘
Well, that's me and a beautiful woman

50
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,330
还有我的手表指示时间为早上2:30
and my watch showing the time as 2:30 in the morning.

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,500
所以  这是呈堂证供A
So, state's exhibit "A"?

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,730
不是  我几天前在天文台认识的她
No. I met her at the planetarium a few days ago,

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,940
然后她邀我去喝一杯
and she invited me out for a drink.

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,400
呦  不错嘛
Oh, good for you. H-Hey,

55
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,940
印地语里狗怎么说
w-what's the Hindi word for "dog"?

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,910
- 库塔  - 你个库塔
- Kutta. - You kutta.

57
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,980
暴暴
Bow-bow.

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,180
这是汪汪的印地语
That's Hindi for woof-woof.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,020
我今晚还要见她
I am seeing her again tonight.

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,450
我今晚也有约会
You know, I also have a date tonight.

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,490
别担心  不是和另一个女人
But don't worry, it's not another woman.

62
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,220
是弦论
It's string theory.

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,460
暴暴
Bow-bow.

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,530
抱歉  他是库塔  你不是
Sorry, he's a kutta, you're not.

65
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,140
- 嗨  - 你好
- Hi. - Hello.

66
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,470
你干啥呢
What you doing?

67
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,380
和我的宝贝再照一张照片
Oh, taking another picture with my baby.

68
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
看他长多大了
Look how big he got.

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,880
看你这么激动真是很有趣
It's fun to see you this excited.

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,950
嗷  谢谢  这话真
Aw, thank you, that's so...

71
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,750
- 别坐在那里  - 什么什么
- Don't sit there! - What, what?

72
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,880
抱歉
I, uh-- sorry.

73
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,150
这是我条理性系统的一部分
I-It's part of my organization system.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,990
那些论文就得放在那里
That's-that's where those papers go.

75
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,460
好吧  要不我就
Okay. Um, how about if I just...

76
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,760
把这个笔记本滑到
slide this notebook...

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,460
噫
Eh...

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,600
好吧  没事
You know what, it's fine.

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,870
我回卧室了
I'll just be in the bedroom.

80
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,370
不不  这也是你的公寓
No, no. Uh, this is your apartment, too.

81
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,900
听着  我今晚就工作到这里
Uh, look, I'll-I'll stop for the night

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,270
然后把这些清理干净
and clean this up.

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,340
这真的好体贴  谢尔顿
Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,810
我知道
I know.

85
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,310
我在尝试这个新的技巧
See, I'm trying this new technique

86
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,410
想象我处在别人的情况下会是什么感觉
where I imagine how I would feel in someone else's position.

87
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,810
你是说同感么
Y-You mean empathy?

88
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,280
哦  我以为这是我发明的
Oh, I thought I came up with it.

89
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,350
无论如何  你能努力我很感激
Well, regardless, I-I appreciate the effort.

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,450
谢谢
Thank you.

91
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,760
真的很难的
It's really hard.

92
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,260
早晨好
Morning.

93
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,130
早晨好
Good morning.

94
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,630
你不必给我做早餐的
Aw, you didn't have to cook me breakfast.

95
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,500
我不是很确定昨晚表现如何
Well, I wasn't sure how I did last night,

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,100
所以我想结束得漂亮点
and I wanted to finish strong.

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,240
不必担心
You don't need to worry.

98
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,540
昨晚很棒
Last night was great.

99
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,340
你现在是这样说
Ah, well, you say that now,

100
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,350
但等你尝了这个再想想
but wait until you taste this.

101
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,850
我的天  太好吃了
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

102
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,550
这就是我为什么在汽车后备箱放煎锅的原因
Which is why I keep an omelet pan in the trunk of my car.

103
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,660
谢谢  很好吃
Well, thank you, it's delicious.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,720
我老公从来没有给我做过饭
My husband never cooked for me.

105
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,930
哦  呃  你结婚了
Oh, uh, y-you were married.

106
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,130
是的  严格的说  我想我仍然已婚
Yeah. Well, technically, I guess I still am.

107
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,500
这个严格的说
Is that "technically,"

108
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,200
是指文件还没通过吗
like, the paperwork hasn't gone through,

109
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,510
或者是指
or "technically,"
119
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:58,247
他此刻正在衣橱里看着咱们
like, he's in the closet watching us right now?

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,450
不不  我们已经分居了
No, no, we're separated.

111
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,150
你介意我们谈点别的吗
Do you mind if we talk about something else?

112
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,550
当然可以
Of course.

113
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,150
你知道吗  我做煎蛋卷好吃的秘诀是
Uh, you know, my secret to making great omelets is that

114
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,850
我把蛋白分开打
I beat the egg whites separately.

115
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,620
说到这个  你已经分居多久了
Speaking of which, how long have you been separated?

116
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,230
大约两周了
About two weeks.

117
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,230
那没多久嘛
That is not a lot of weeks.

118
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,200
实际上呢  也就刚刚够使用复数的星期
In fact, that's the bare minimum to get to the plural "weeks."

119
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,140
没关系
Doesn't matter.

120
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,540
他搬走了  我也向前看了
He moved out, I moved on.

121
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,970
哦  很好
Oh. Good.

122
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,180
是的  我能问下他是干嘛的吗
Yeah, do you mind me asking what he does for a living?

123
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,610
他是消防员
He's a firefighter.

124
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,380
哦  有意思
Oh. Interesting.

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,480
一个会用斧子的潜在嫉妒者
A potentially jealous man who's handy with an ax.

126
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,620
不过没事
It's-it's okay, though.

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,720
他至少还有两周时间冷静一下
He's almost had two weeks to cool down.

128
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,360
下一个药是皮炎平
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

129
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,590
哦  我知道这个
Oh, I know this one.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,930
我们正在主推这款药
We're actually pushing it really hard.

131
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,460
它治疗轻度皮炎
It treats mild dermatitis.

132
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,930
呃  对的  它可以被开给哪些人
Uh, correct. And who can it be prescribed to?

133
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,140
成年人和那些毫无疑问
Adults and children who have absolutely, for sure,

134
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,270
完全停止生长的孩子
stopped growing.

135
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,670
又对了
Right again.

136
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,540
副作用有哪些
And what are the side effects?

137
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,440
哦  糟糕  糟糕
Oh, shoot, shoot.

138
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,910
  想想你的记忆标记
Mm, remember the mnemonic.

139
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,880
啊  肉汁  是的  G-R-A-V-Y
Ah-- GRAVY, yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

140
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,180
好的  胃痛  泛红  肛漏
Okay, gastric distress, redness, anal leakage,

141
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,090
血管炎  黄眼睛
vasculitis and yellow eyes.

142
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,890
哦  呃 很接近了
Oh, uh, so close.

143
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,990
它实际上是黄色分泌物
It's actually yellow discharge.

144
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,060
哦对
Oh, right.

145
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,230
所以我们用肉汁来帮助记忆
That's why we went with "gravy."

146
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,530
你好
Hello.

147
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,630
- 嘿  - 好呀
- Hey. - Hi.

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,770
他知道他已经不住这儿了  对吗
He knows he doesn't live here anymore, right?

149
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,510
可能他这会儿失忆中因为他吃了
Maybe he's experiencing memory loss because he took...

150
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,850
- 忘情水  - 是的
- Flaxitrite. - Yeah.

151
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,250
- 谢谢你  - 呃  谢尔顿  你在干嘛
- Thank you. - Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?

152
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,550
哦  我就检查一下我以前的房间
Oh, I was just checking in on my old room

153
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,990
看看你们拿来做什么了
to see what you've done with it.

154
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,650
为什么
Why?

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,720
我可以用来晚上工作
Well, I could use a place to work in the evenings, and...

156
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,630
- 不行  - 还不是因为
- No. - Well, it's just that

157
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,430
- 我们家没那么大空间  - 不行
- there's not a lot of space in our apartment... - No.

158
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,330
好吧  我觉得艾米已经
Well, and I feel like Amy's been having...

159
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,400
不行
No.

160
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,370
既然你们没有
And since you're not...

161
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,730
不行
No.

162
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,800
它
It's...

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
不行
No.

164
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,070
不行
No.

165
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,640
现在那是我们的房间了
That is our room now,

166
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,440
我们打算把它变成健身房
and we're gonna turn it into a gym.

167
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,240
你真的以为我会信啊
Do you really expect me to believe that?

168
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,450
- 不会  - 不会
- No. - No.

169
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
所以让我困扰的是
So I guess what's bugging me

170
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,950
他们13天前才分开
is that they only broke up 13 days ago,

171
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,790
而我现在就在和她约会了
and now I'm dating her.

172
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,190
那么我是自己认为的好人呢
So, am I, like, the good guy in my movie,

173
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,690
还是他们认为的坏人
or the bad guy in their movie?

174
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,890
反正我们十分确定你是一个奇怪的朋友
Pretty sure you're the weird friend in our movie.

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,300
我喜欢她  好吗
I like her, okay?

176
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,560
我就是  不知道在一段关系中做了第三者
I just, I-I don't know how I feel about

177
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,600
是什么感受
being the third wheel in a relationship.

178
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,970
这就是在我床上和我老婆一起的那个人说出的话
Says the guy in my bed with my wife.

179
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,440
伙计们  我意思是  他还没有放下
Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?

180
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,470
很明显他因为分手而不开心
He's apparently not happy about the breakup,

181
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,410
根据他留在家里的运动裤来看
and based on the sweatpants he left at her place,

182
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,780
他应该是一个中等身材的男人
he's, like, a medium to large man.

183
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,220
说不定那是他的春节长肉裤呢
Maybe those are his "after the holiday" pants,

184
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,920
你不也有嘛
like you have.

185
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,250
哦  不是  我是说
Oh, no. I mean, do you think

186
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,690
你觉得她现在约会是不是太早了
it's too soon for her to be dating?

187
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,020
如果你和伯纳黛特分手了
If you and Bernadette broke up,

188
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,290
你会等多久啊
like, how long would you wait?

189
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,420
哦  我根本都不愿意想
Oh, well, I don't even want to think...

190
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,590
八天
Eight days.

191
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,430
什么
What?

192
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,600
两天用来哭  六天去健身房
Two days to cry. Six days to hit the gym.

193
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,100
首先  你已经看上去很迷人了
First of all, you already look amazing.

194
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,570
啊  嘴真甜啊
Aw, that's sweet.

195
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,470
我再多为他哭一天
I'm gonna give him an extra day of crying.

196
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,280
答案还是不行
The answer is still no.

197
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,620
你能说我们不会知道你在这儿  但是我们肯定知道啊
You can say we wouldn't know you're here, but we'd know.

198
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,390
因为你在这儿嘛
Because you'd be here!

199
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,760
那是谁呀
So, who was that?

200
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,430
我不敢相信你竟然挂我电话
I can't believe you hung up on me!

201
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,700
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

202
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

203
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,970
我在证明你是错的啊
I am proving you wrong.

204
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,330
我都在这工作四小时了
I've been working back there for hours.

205
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,000
你们都不知道
You had no idea.

206
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,070
帮我呀
Do something.

207
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,340
搞什么鬼  你在这儿弄啥嘞
What the hell? What are you doing here?

208
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,940
我在试着尊重艾米
I-I am trying to respect Amy.

209
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,210
好吧
Okay, look,

210
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,110
你有办公室可以工作啊  为什么不去呢
you have an office at work. Why don't you go there?

211
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,950
我不能每次有个好点子就去办公室啊
I can't go to the office every time I have a brilliant thought.

212
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,050
那样的话我基本上就住办公室了
I'd basically be living there.

213
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,190
听起来不错  那你就住那吧
Sounds good, do that.

214
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,590
不行  校园里晚上一点都不安全
No. No, the campus isn't safe at night.

215
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,660
浣熊和本科生四处乱窜就好像大学
There's raccoons and undergrads just walking around

216
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,760
是他们家开的一样
like they own the place.

217
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,090
听着
Look.

218
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,660
我需要在晚上能工作的地方
I need somewhere to work in the evenings.

219
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,100
你有块不用的地方
You have a space you aren't using.

220
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,570
就考虑下我的请求吧
Just take a look at my proposal.

221
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,770
这是什么
What is this?

222
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,740
租赁协议
A rental agreement.

223
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,440
我只会用那房间来工作
I will only use the room for work.

224
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
我不会睡在里面  我不会吃你家的
I-I won't sleep here, I won't eat your food,

225
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,680
也不会用你家卫生间
I won't even use your bathroom.

226
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,810
那你就能不分时间的随意进出我家吗
So you can just walk in any time of the day or night?

227
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,350
他现在就这么干
Well, he does that now.

228
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,080
至少这样我们还能得点钱
At least this way we'll get paid.

229
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,920
我是拉杰什・库萨帕里博士
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

230
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,820
感谢你们能和我一起在
and thank you for taking a walk with me...

231
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,190
繁星中漫步
through the stars.

232
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,000
我觉得你那遍停顿有点太长了
I-I think that one was too long.

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
是啊  我也感觉到了
Yeah, you're right. I totally felt it.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,100
我们再来一遍呀
Should we, uh, run it again?

235
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,170
上帝啊  求求你可别了
Please, God, no.

236
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,010
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

237
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,980
有什么能帮到你的吗
Can I help you?

238
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,810
你们哪一个是拉杰什・库萨帕里
Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?

239
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,510
你真的不知道我俩谁是
Really? You're not sure

240
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,620
拉杰什・库萨帕里吗
which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,220
我知道  我只是不想让人看成是种族歧视
I am. I was just trying not to be racist.

242
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,590
我是内尔的丈夫
I'm Nell's husband.

243
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,300
事情是这样的  在那事之前
h-here's the thing-- I didn't know

244
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,530
我都不知道她结婚了
that she was married until after...

245
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,900
什么事情
After what?

246
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,570
我
I'm...

247
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,270
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

248
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,110
这也不会让我好到哪去
Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

249
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,880
什么能让你感觉好点
Wh-What would make you feel better?

250
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,510
我要你别再跟我的老婆约会了
I want you to stop seeing my wife.

251
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,050
没毛病  很高兴见到你  拜拜
Done. Nice to meet you. Bye.

252
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,620
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

253
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,030
嘿  老铁  你想谈谈吗
Hey, buddy, do-do you want to talk?

254
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,800
我以为我们要一起组建家庭
I thought we were gonna start a family.

255
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,770
结果一转眼  全都完了
Next thing I know, it's over.

256
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,110
一切都会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.

257
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,610
怎么会好起来
How is it gonna be okay?

258
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,980
你都把我老婆给睡了
You're sleeping with my wife.

259
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,280
我的意思是  除此之外
I mean, besides that.

260
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,220
我能给你拿点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

261
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,760
一杯水
A glass of water?

262
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,390
还是激光秀
A laser show?

263
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,060
- 不用  谢谢你  - 谢天谢地
- No, thank you.  - Oh, good.

264
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,900
因为我都不知道怎么把那玩意儿打开
'Cause I don't, I don't even know how to turn it on.

265
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,160
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,030
我就不该来这儿
I shouldn't have come here.

267
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,540
我想我只是想看看她用谁替代了我
I guess I just wanted to see who she replaced me with.

268
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,340
别这么说
Don't say that.

269
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,970
你俩的感情是很特殊的
What you two had was special.

270
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,440
是谁也替代不了的
No one can replace you.

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,580
她这么说的吗
Did she say that?

272
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,040
不是
No.

273
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,350
我得走了  行吗
I should go, right?

274
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,550
待着别动
Stay.

275
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,620
好的  我晚点打改你
Okay, I'll call you later.

276
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,850
听着  如果我这么说能让你感觉好点的话
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

277
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,790
我都不怎么认识她
I barely know her.

278
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,230
那她还跟你上床了
And she had sex with you?

279
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,190
内尔告诉我你是消防员
Nell tells me you're a fireman.

280
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,660
当消防员是什么感觉啊
What's that like?

281
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,970
他在那个房间里真的让我
Okay, I-I-I'm really uncomfortable

282
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,280
感到不爽
with him back in that room.

283
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,240
为什么  他一天都没弄动静
Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.

284
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,210
你不明白
Y-Y-You don't get it.

285
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,150
我们生活在一起这么多年
All the years that we lived together,

286
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,380
他总是把我逼到发疯
he drove me crazy the whole time.

287
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,590
而他现在却不那样了
And now he's not.

288
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,390
就是说啊
Exactly.

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,590
别那么看着我
D-Don't look at me like that.

290
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,890
这意味着  他是故意的
It-it-it means he did it on purpose.

291
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,960
这是可以选择的
It was a choice.

292
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,830
就好像发现哥斯拉其实不用毁灭东京  吃阿比家的
That-That's like finding out Godzilla could've had Arby's

293
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,830
Arby's  美国快餐品牌

294
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,200
快餐也行
instead of Tokyo.

295
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,400
日本哪有阿比的店啊
I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.

296
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,870
这不是重点
Not my point.

297
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,610
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

298
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,010
谢尔顿
Sheldon!

299
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,250
抱歉  我太吵了吗
I'm sorry. Am I being too loud?

300
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,220
没有  你明知道自己表现很好
No, you're being perfect and you know it.

301
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,150
你想让我变成一个不那么体贴的房客吗
Would you like me to be a less considerate tenant?

302
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,520
不  好吧  啥玩意
No. Yes. What...?

303
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,030
别再惹我生气了
Stop messing with me!

304
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,300
嘿  我错了
Hey, I was wrong.

305
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,400
在冲绳就有一家阿比
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

306
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,810
他跟她的哥哥是好朋友
He was best friends with her older brother,

307
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,070
但是他根本都没有注意到她
but he didn't even notice her.

308
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,340
然后几年之后
And then years afterward,

309
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,780
他们在车管所里偶遇
they randomly bumped into each other at the DMV.

310
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,910
两个小时候  他们就相爱了
Two hours later, they were in love.

311
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,620
你在他的驾照照片上真的可以看到爱情的小火花
You can really see the sparkle in his license photo.

312
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,790
他是在天文馆告诉你这些的吗
He told you all this at the planetarium?

313
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,490
不是  我们去了馅饼之屋
No, no, we went to House of Pies.

314
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,060
他点了香蕉奶油派  我点了椰子派
He got banana cream. I got coconut.

315
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,860
我俩平分了账单
We did halfsies.

316
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,830
你和另外一个男人平分了派的账单
You did pie halfsies with another man?

317
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,960
你是说除了你之外吗
You mean other than you?

318
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,100
是啊
Yeah.

319
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,300
我为他感到难过
I feel bad for him, Bernie.

320
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,640
他是个好人
He's a, he's a good guy.

321
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,140
如果你过意不去的话
Well, if you're uncomfortable with it,

322
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,980
或许你不应该和他老婆继续睡下去了
maybe stop sleeping with his wife.

323
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,280
我不认为这是性的问题
I don't think the sex is the problem.

324
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,850
我可以肯定的是我做得还可以
I know for a fact I was just okay.

325
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,180
我得声明一下  派之屋
For the record, I'm the one

326
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
是我介绍给你的
who introduced you to House of Pies.

327
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,190
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

328
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,790
是莱纳德啊
Oh, Leonard.

329
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,790
抱歉  我就是  我在那边待不下去了
Sorry, I just, I had to get out of there.

330
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,330
他又干嘛了
What did he do now?

331
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,460
什么也没干  他简直完美的就像在做梦一样
Nothing. He's being a dream.

332
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
别这样看着我
Don't give me that look.

333
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,470
佩妮就是这么看我的  我没疯
That's how Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.

334
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,000
我表示你疯了的表情和佩妮的一样吗
Penny and I have the same "You're crazy" look?

335
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,470
好甜喔
That's kind of sweet.

336
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,210
我知道如何应对谢尔顿表现出他原本的样子
I know how to deal with Sheldon being Sheldon,

337
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,480
但现在谢尔顿就作为一个有理性会体贴的人
but Sheldon being a-a rational, thoughtful person?

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,580
我无所适从了  就像
I'm clueless. I-It's like

339
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,950
去年我妈妈打电话给我唱生日快乐时
when my mom called last year to sing happy birthday

340
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,620
我直接吐了
and I-I just threw up.

341
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,890
如果你承受不了的话
Well, if it gets to be too much,

342
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,820
你可以把他轰回来啊
you can always send him back over here.

343
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,190
我和他签了协议
I made a deal with him,

344
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,660
另外  那样对你很不公平
and besides, that wouldn't be fair to you.

345
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,390
其实  我想他了
Well, actually, I miss him.

346
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
他最近经常待在那边
He's been over there a lot.

347
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,570
那太好了  你告诉他可以回来了
Well, great. Tell him he can come back.

348
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,530
我不能  他很考虑我的感受
I can't. He's thinking of me and my feelings

349
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,100
他想要尊重我一些
and trying to be respectful.

350
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,840
这也是他对我做的  那个混球
That's what he's doing to me, too, the jerk!

351
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,540
别这样
Stop that.

352
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,750
你生气的表情和谢尔顿便秘时一样
Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's constipated look are the same.

353
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,850
这样真好
This is nice.

354
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,020
是啊
It is.

355
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,890
她以前就是这么吻我的
She used to kiss me like that.

356
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,260
你还好吗
You okay?

357
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,200
嗯  我没事  抱歉
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

358
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,540
我的天  我好孤单啊
Oh, God, I'm so alone.

359
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,240
对不起  我不能这么做
Sorry, I can't do this.

360
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
怎么了
What's going on?

361
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,480
前几天我见到了奥利弗
I met Oliver the other day.

362
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,210
等等  你追查到了我的丈夫
Wait, you tracked down my husband?

363
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,850
没有  那多诡异啊
No, that would be weird.

364
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,690
是他追查到了我  然后我们一起共度了夜晚
He tracked me down, then we spent the evening together.

365
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,360
我真无法相信
I don't believe this.

366
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,960
他会做那种事只是因为他在乎你
He-he only did it because he cares about you.

367
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,900
不  他会做那种事是因为他占有欲强以及嫉妒
No, he did it because he's possessive and jealous.

368
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,100
真的吗  我完全没这么想
Really? I didn't get that at all.

369
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
他给我的感觉十分舒服
He made me feel very comfortable.

370
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,700
很高兴你们俩这么来电
Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.

371
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,070
你知道吗  我觉得你这样对他不太公平
You know, I don't think that you're being very fair to him.

372
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,010
你站在他那边
You're taking his side?

373
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,480
没有  但我应该告诉你  他确实
No, but I should point out that he did offer

374
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,610
提出过要咨询婚姻顾问  所以至少你们之间有一个人在努力呢
to go to counseling, so at least one of you is trying.

375
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,510
你比他还疯狂
You're crazier than he is.

376
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,420
我告诉你  你应该再给他一次机会
I'll tell you what, just give him one more chance

377
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,520
如果没能成功的话
and if it doesn't work out,

378
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
我会很乐意继续和你睡的
I'll be happy to keep sleeping with you.

379
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,990
你会吗
You would?

380
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,830
不管怎样  你都会有一个枕边人的
Either way, you've got yourself a fella.

381
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,930
多棒啊
Like, how nice is that?

382
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,640
谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

383
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,310
你好
Hello.

384
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,580
你的合同中提到了为期三天的试用期
So, your contract provides for a three-day trial period,

385
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,910
而我觉得这并不可行
and I don't think this is working out.

386
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,450
所以  用法律术语来说
So, to put it in legal terms,

387
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,720
甲方希望
the party of the first part would like

388
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,790
乙方离开这里
the party of the second part to get out.

389
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,690
试用期什么时间结束
What time does the trial period end?

390
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,420
中午12点
12:00, noon.

391
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,490
那在这句话之后写了什么
Yeah-- what does it say after that?

392
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,430
东部标准时间
Eastern Standard Time.

393
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,640
那是三个小时之前了
That was three hours ago.

394
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,370
考虑到你并未行使
And, uh, since you didn't exercise

395
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,780
撤销权  我行使了我的权力
your right to revoke, I exercised my right to extend,

396
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,310
让这份你已经违反的
triggering this long-form rental agreement...

397
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,880
长期租赁协议生效了
...of which you're already in violation.

398
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,690
这只是一沓子纸而已
This is just a-a bunch of paper.

399
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,990
你不能强制执行
You can't enforce this.

400
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,990
雇个律师  我们走着瞧
Hire a lawyer. Let's find out.

401
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,690
我才不会同意
This is not happening.

402
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
即便如此
Be that as it may,

403
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,960
第九页上写明  你必须提供给我
page nine says that you have to provide me

404
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,470
柠檬味苏打水  所以  麻溜的吧
with lemon-flavored sparkling waters, so... chop-chop.

405
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,810
怎么样了
Hey, how'd it go?

406
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,980
显然他是不会离开的
Well, apparently he's not leaving

407
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,280
而且我还得去给他买苏打水
and I have to go get him sparkling water.

408
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,980
你为什么在微笑
Why are you smiling?

409
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,480
我也不知道  就是觉得这样才对呢
I don't know. It just feels right.

410
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,390
这场繁星之旅
...to the stars.

411
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,570
嘿  哥们
Hey, buddy.

412
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,770
我和内尔谈过了
I talked to Nell.

413
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,370
她在你离开后很伤心
She was pretty upset after you left.

414
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,710
- 很抱歉  - 不  不不不
- Yeah, I'm sorry. - No. No, no, no.

415
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,380
她告诉我你说了一些很诡异的话
She told me that you said something so creepy

416
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,150
相比之下我就强多了
that I seemed great in comparison.

417
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,080
我知道是哪句诡异的话
I know exactly what it was.

418
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,250
我  不  其实
I... no, actually,

419
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,620
也可能会是其它的几句话
there was a couple of things it could've been.

420
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,990
不管是哪句话  都很诡异
Whichever one it was, it was creepy.

421
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,660
总之  我去安慰了她
Anyway, uh, I went over to comfort her,

422
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,190
我们谈过了  我们应该会再给彼此一次机会
and we talked, and I think we're gonna give it another chance.

423
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,100
我真为你高兴
I am so happy for you! Hey-hey-hey.

424
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
我们应该去庆祝一下
Hey, uh, we should celebrate.

425
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,800
派之屋
House of Pies?

426
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,430
你懂我
You know it.

427
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,140
我们要不要邀请内尔一起
Should we invite Nell?

428
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,240
- 必须得邀请她吗  - 才不是
- Do we have to? - Nah.

429
