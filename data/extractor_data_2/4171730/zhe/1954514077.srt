1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,060
厄尔  能借你的报纸看吗
Earl, can I borrow your paper?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,790
我想看看星座运势表
I want to check my horoscope

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,680
看看我未来还是不是个"婊"
to see if I'll still be a whore in the future.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,730
先念谁的星座呢
All right, who wants to go first?

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,580
我的  我的  我的[上我]
Ooh, do me. Do me. Do me.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,710
你能不能别每天晚上
Can we have one night at the diner

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,500
都在餐厅里对女人喊出这句话啊
that doesn't end with you yelling that at a woman?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,790
好吧  先念我的
All right, I'll go.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,290
"双子座  双生子"
"Gemini, the twins,"

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,960
这"两娃"都过得挺好  下一个  
And they're both doing fine, so let's move on.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,050
阿憨  你是什么星座
Han, what sign are you?

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,440
我猜是《四十岁老处男》座
I'm guessing the 40-year-old Virgo.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,160
麦克斯  你哪需要星座运势表
Max, you don't need that paper.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,880
本大仙告诉你未来如何
I'll tell you what's in your future--

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
用我当你的推荐人去墨西哥餐馆找工作
using my name as a reference at Chipotle.

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,750
你们真信这些狗屁玩意吗
You guys really believe in that crap?

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,940
上面都是写你们想听的
They just tell you what you want to hear.

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,860
"你会大富大贵  你会名扬四海"
"You will be rich. You will be famous."

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,770
你觉得如果有报纸写
You'd think I'd buy a newspaper if it said,

20
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,520
"你会是75岁的收银员"  我会买吗
"You will be a 75-year-old cashier"?

21
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:06,769
准备好开店了吗
Okay, ready to open?

22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,179
过去从来没有  未来也不会有
Never have been, never will be.

23
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,619
咱们开门吧
Let's do this.

24
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,309
等等
Wait.

25
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,499
我们得念一下我们的开店宣誓
We have to do our business affirmation.

26
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,169
求你了  老天爷  别让我们横死店里
Please, God, don't let us be murdered in here.

27
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:18,999
好了  开门接客吧
All right, let's open 'em up.

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,259
-我勒个去  -麦克斯
- Oh, hell no. - Max.

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,639
等会  我还没感叹完
Hang on. I wasn't done.

30
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:26,879
我勒个大去哦
Oh, hell no!

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,489
她在"毛线轰炸"那自行车
Oh, she's yarn-bombing that bike.

32
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,759
{\an8}大约2009年开始的次文化  用针织毛线来取代喷漆涂鸦

33
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,759
好有奇思妙想  好新鲜
It's whimsical. It's new.

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,629
好蠢
It's stupid.

35
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,459
喷漆涂鸦  我能理解
Graffiti, I get.

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,569
比如看到墙上喷了"去死吧  贱人"
I see, "die, bitch. Die," on a wall,

37
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,919
我就觉得"好吧  这位先生很想发泄心中不快"
I think, "okay, this gentleman wanted to get that off his chest."

38
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,219
但这个毛线玩意可悲透了
But this yarn-ival is pathetic.

39
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,709
喂  毛线妞
Yo, yarnie.

40
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,479
人家是有名字的
I have a name.

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,799
我叫滚娘
It's Guinevere.

42
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,899
没错  果然人如其名
Yep, that checks out.

43
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,179
你这是在搞什么
What's happening over here?

44
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,079
你为什么要侵犯可怜的小车车
Why are you molesting that poor bike?

45
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,579
我是在美化城市
I am beautifying the city

46
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,969
用我活力十足的大作慢慢改善市容
one living, glorious work of art at a time.

47
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,639
随时欢迎你们给点小费哦
And tips are always appreciated.

48
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,559
给你个建议[小费]
Here's a tip:

49
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,429
滚回学校好好读书
Go back to school and learn a trade

50
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:14,199
在花完你爹的钱之前学门手艺
before daddy's money runs out.

51
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,679
我从来...
Well, I never--

52
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,019
没有工作过任何一天吗  我们知道
worked a day in your life, we know.

53
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,039
你觉得这也算艺术品吗
You think this is artwork?

54
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,599
一个加菲猫马克杯才算艺术品  宝贝
Artwork is a Garfield mug, sweetheart.

55
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,609
如果你有个加菲猫躺吊床上说
You got Garfield in a hammock, saying,

56
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,509
"我不是过胖  只是过于不够高大"
"I'm not overweight. I'm under-tall,"

57
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:30,659
老娘立刻在这里给你盖个美术馆
I'll build you a gallery right here.

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,649
您还是请走吧
Look, you should move on.

59
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,029
我的朋友不想你...
My friend doesn't want you--

60
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,549
我该怎么说呢
How shall I put this?

61
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,129
在我们店门口拉这么大一泡"毛线"
Taking a giant knit in front of our shop.

62
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,569
这有啥不对  那台自行车又不是你们的
What is the problem? It is not even your bike.

63
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,959
都被锁在那边大概有四个月了吧
It's been chained here for, like, four months.

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,529
是咩
Oh, yeah?

65
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,589
或许它就是我们的
Maybe it is our bike,

66
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,529
我们骑它去外送小蛋糕
and we use it for deliveries

67
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,239
以及用它给自行车宅下套
and to trap nerds.

68
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,809
慢走不送  大麻妞
Peace out, ganja beer,

69
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,329
不然我织个三尺毛绫  吊死你
before I knit you a noose.

70
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,949
麦克斯  刚才的主意真棒
Max, that was a great idea.

71
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,419
哪个  叫她滚回去读书吗
What, that she go back to school?

72
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,149
本来就是嘛
I know.

73
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:07,539
好歹读个夜校之类的吧
At least a couple night classes, right?

74
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,629
认识一些正常人
Get around some people.

75
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,909
她早没救了  不用鸟她
She's a lost cause. Let's move on.

76
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,059
我是说我们做外送
I'm talking about us doing deliveries.

77
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,939
为什么我们从不外送[让人满意]呢
Why do we never deliver?

78
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,569
别拖我下水  我的"恩客满意度"有口皆碑
Speak for yourself. I've delivered.

79
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:25,189
说真的  麦克斯  那些有外送的
Seriously, Max, those delivery services--

80
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,699
外送网站  送餐软件  生意超大
Eat24, Grubhub-- do big business.

81
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,099
现在没人想出门了
No one wants to go out now.

82
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,779
大家都懒死了
People are so lazy.

83
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,079
我也懒得出去送
I don't really feel like it.

84
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,199
别闹了  麦克斯
Seriously, Max, all we have to do

85
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,049
我们只需要额外收个外送费
is slap a delivery charge on that product,

86
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,349
一个5块钱的小蛋糕会让我们数钱数到手抽筋
and suddenly, a $5 cupcake is bringing in more money.

87
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,509
你知道数钱数到手抽筋代表什么吗
And do you know what more money means?

88
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,059
我没经验  哪可能懂啊
No. How would I know that?

89
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,719
好了  提问
Okay, question:

90
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,439
哪件衣服比较配我裸下身
which of these goes better with no pants?

91
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,499
不知道  两件都是永恒款
I don't know. They're both timeless...

92
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,849
永恒没有适合场合穿的"永恒款"
As in, there's no time you should wear those.

93
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,189
你没法用客观眼光  你看到我就想扑上来
You can't be objective. You're like a kid in a candy store.

94
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,199
我要问麦克斯
I'll ask Max.

95
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:10,389
红色那件很搭你的红疹
Uh, well, the red one kind of matches your rash.

96
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,069
答案揭晓了
I think we have a winner.

97
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,949
为什么今晚要穿上你的网眼战袍呢
So why are you trying out the fancy mesh tonight?

98
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,609
虽然我跟苏菲重修旧好了
Well, even though Sophie and I are getting back together,

99
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,029
但我们想要把性爱的部分弄得特别点
we wanted to make it special and hold off on the sexual part

100
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,129
所以一直等到今晚才要圆房
of the relationship until tonight.

101
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,869
-好浪漫  -是啊
- That is so sweet. - I know.

102
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:26,079
我进来前刚打完飞机
I haven't even masturbated 

103
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,109
一直忍到现在都没再打哦
since right before I came in here.

104
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,219
栗宝  我在杂货店买便宜卷纸的时候
So, Chestnut, I was buying some rolling papers at the bodega,

105
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,789
我怕丢人所以说是帮你买的  别生气啊
and I hope this is cool, but I said they were for you.

106
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,659
麦克斯  我有个好消息跟坏消息
Max, I have good news and bad news.

107
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,599
坏消息是
The bad news is,

108
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,589
这是我三年来唯一一件好消息
This is the only good news I've had in three years.

109
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,809
而好消息是...
And the good news is...

110
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,189
你找到新家要搬走了吗
You found yourself a new apartment?

111
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:54,469
臭女人  别让我白高兴啊
Don't toy with me, woman.

112
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:55,879
好好说  口齿清晰的说
Speak plainly and clearly.

113
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,039
你是不是找到新家要搬走了
Did you find a new apartment?

114
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,109
闭上眼睛  我给你个提示
Close your eyes. I'll give you a hint.

115
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,039
上一次别人让我闭上眼睛后
Last time I was told to close my eyes,

116
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,389
再睁开眼  发现自己穿着比基尼在垃圾船上
I woke up in a bikini on a garbage barge.

117
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:10,859
不过那是我此生最接近出海度假的一次了
P.S., closest I ever got to a vacation.

118
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,789
你的新男友是个小丑吗
Oh, you're dating a clown?

119
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,919
怎么可能  如果我有幸
Please, you know I would have told you

120
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,989
能跟有车一族约会  我早告诉你了
if I was dating someone who had a car.

121
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,989
{\an8}小丑出名的杂技之一就是一群小丑塞进小车里

122
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,369
你看  是店门口那台被人弃置的自行车
Look, it's the abandoned bike from in front of the shop.

123
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,519
它本来的确是店门口的自行车
It was the bike from the front of the shop.

124
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,889
现在则像是《鲁保罗变装自行车秀》的参赛者
Now it looks like a contestant on RuPaul's bike race.

125
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,889
{\an8}《鲁保罗变装皇后秀》 
看一群男人每周变装成女人的真人秀

126
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,529
我们要骑它去送外送
We're gonna use it to make deliveries.

127
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,169
我已经接了三个外送的单了
I already signed us up for three delivery services.

128
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,539
人穷依旧聪明如我
Still crazy smart.

129
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,599
浪费时间
Waste of time.

130
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,139
亚马逊都有无人飞机外送了
Amazon's got drones,

131
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,599
我们只有这台基爆的自行车
and we've got one gay bike.

132
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:45,809
我不想送外送
I don't want to do deliveries.

133
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,409
我来吧  你做小蛋糕  我送小蛋糕
I got this. You bake, I'll bike.

134
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,189
你送外卖去  我吸大麻去
And while you bike, I'll get baked.

135
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,329
我去把三个"送"全搞定了
I'm just gonna knock out these three "delivs"

136
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,829
然后就在店里跟你会合
and I'll met you at the cupcake shop.

137
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,699
-"送"是啥  -你喜欢"送"吗
- "Delivs"? - You like "delivs"?

138
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,759
是我给"外送"取的"短化叫"
It's an "abbreve" I made up for "deliveries."

139
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,599
你喜欢"短化叫"吗
You like "abbreve"?

140
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,559
是我给"短化叫法"取的"短叫"
It's an "ab" I made up for "abbreviation."

141
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,659
我也长话短说  滚
I'm gonna make this short. Get out.

142
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,689
大家安安
Hey, everybody.

143
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,879
苏菲  你觉得如何
Sophie, what do you think?

144
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,149
好事啊  卡洛琳
Aw, good for you, Caroline.

145
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,399
我早就建议你搞个"粉色的东西"骑
I've been saying that you should hop on something

146
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,429
你终于听我的话了
pink and ride it since I met you.

147
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,759
麦克斯  我就希望跟你独处
Ah, Max, I'm so glad you're alone,

148
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,369
因为我需要些"女孩谈话"
'cause I need some girl talk.

149
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,279
但上一次我跟人"女孩谈话"
Okay, but the last time I did girl talk,

150
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,799
首分钟收费3块钱
I got $3 for the first minute

151
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,469
之后每分钟1块钱呢
and $1 for each additional minute.

152
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,829
是跟奥列格有关的
No, it's about Oleg.

153
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,459
昨晚  他不能...
Last night, he was unable to...

154
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,409
我该怎么说得好听点呢
Oh, what's a nice way to say this?

155
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:47,099
他的小兵没有办法立正站好
He couldn't get his soldier to stand at attention,

156
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,319
然后他的鸡鸡也一直"垂头丧气"
and his penis wouldn't work either.

157
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,189
你试过去买一些
Well, uh, have you tried buying

158
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,449
女性杂志来读吗
a Cosmopolitan magazine or something?

159
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,409
里面通常有很多闺房建议
They usually have advice on sex stuff

160
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,899
以及如何痛恨自己身材的建议
and how to hate your body.

161
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,549
麦克斯
Max...

162
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,049
你不会觉得是因为我的关系吧
You don't think it could be me, do you?

163
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:08,749
怎么可能  苏菲  你辣到爆
No way, Sophie. You are hot.

164
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,249
奥列格第一次见你时
The first time Oleg saw you,

165
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,179
他的"小兵"不止"敬礼"了
His soldier not only saluted.

166
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:14,209
还"爆"了呢
It exploded.

167
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,119
你说得对  我魅力无法挡
You're right. I am hot.

168
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,819
全是他的问题
It's all him.

169
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,199
还记得我刚才说过不用你来送外卖吗
Remember when I said you didn't have to do deliveries?

170
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,369
你得来负责送外卖
You're gonna have to do deliveries,

171
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,529
因为我才骑个两个街区远
'cause I only went two blocks,

172
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,169
就跟希亚・拉博夫被抓酒驾时留一样多的汗了
and I'm sweating like Shia Lebeouf at a DUI checkpoint.

173
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,169
{\an8}主演过《变形金刚》的美国男演员
曾因酒驾发生车祸  后又拒绝酒侧而被吊销驾照

174
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,757
好吧  你外送  我来负责销售窗口
Okay, you deliver. I'll open the window.

175
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:36,977
但首先  开店宣誓
But first, business affirmation.

176
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:41,927
求你了  老天爷  别让我们被人拿枪敲到死
Please, God, don't let us get pistol-whipped in here.

177
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:51,357
不是滚娘干的就是蜘蛛侠出柜了
It's either that Guinevere or spider-man came out.

178
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,537
卡洛琳  我能跟你聊一件私事吗
Caroline, can I talk to you about a private matter,

179
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,457
私事就是指私处的事
by which I mean the matter is my privates.

180
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,147
好  快点说  奥列格
Okay, but hurry, Oleg.

181
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,077
我还得处理这"捕梦网"的事
I'm in the middle of a dream catcher situation,

182
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,837
真是捕了个大噩梦
and it's a nightmare.

183
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,637
而且为啥找我聊
And why me?

184
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,687
因为我相信你  也尊敬你
'Cause I trust and respect you

185
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:12,637
而且我觉得你对处理"软脚鸡"会很有一套
And I feel like you know your way around a limp penis.

186
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,027
可能吧
Maybe.

187
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,197
我跟我的心理医生说过了
I talked to my therapist--

188
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:22,187
罗伊  你懂的  那个星巴克店员
Roy, you know, down at the Starbucks.

189
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,417
他说这都是心理因素
He told me it's all mental.

190
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,037
但是我们没再深入探讨下去
We didn't get much further than that.

191
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:29,817
他打翻了一杯大杯咖啡到他拖鞋上
He spilled a grande mochaccino on his sandals.

192
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:31,647
你可能只是怯场
You're probably just scared.

193
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,637
亲密关系对某些男人很难
Intimacy is so hard for some guys,

194
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:36,227
也因此害他们很难硬
it's not hard for some guys.

195
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:39,297
是啊  这太难懂了
Yeah, that's all over my head.

196
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:42,757
麦克斯忘了拿外送单
Oh, no, Max forgot the order slips.

197
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,687
奥列格  我相信会水到渠成的
Oleg, I'm sure it'll all work out.

198
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:48,267
祝你的"通心粉"早日"软硬适中"
Good luck getting your penne al dente.

199
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,687
还是太难懂了
Again, over my head.

200
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,897
麦克斯  你在干嘛
Max, what are you doing?

201
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,687
你才在干嘛咧
What are you doing?

202
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,267
你说我在干嘛
What am I doing?

203
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,567
我在看着你把
Well, I think I'm watching you shove

204
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,427
我们的外送车塞进优步出租车里
our delivery bike into the back of an Uber car.

205
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:07,867
{\an8}美国新时代出租车公司  以私家车搭配手机软件模式营运
也提供种种高档车型的车辆预约

206
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,867
这下可超级[优步]尴尬了
Well, this is uber-awkward.

207
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,557
快点  坐就坐  不坐就走
Come on, come on. In or out.

208
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:13,367
卡洛琳  他叫米利旭  拼写有个不发音的K
All right, Caroline, this is Kmilesh, with a “k.”

209
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,387
他不去机场
He doesn't go to the airport,

210
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,947
他有一次载过五月天部分成员
and he once drove some of Maroon 5--

211
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,987
所以是三月天
so Maroon 3.

212
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,317
别这样  卡洛琳
No, stop. Caroline.

213
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,577
如果你想我去送小蛋糕
If you want me to deliver the cupcakes,

214
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,307
我不能骑车去  我得坐车去
I can't use the bike, I have to use the car.

215
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:28,217
为什么
Why?

216
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,587
天啊  你怀孕了吗
Oh, my God, are you pregnant?

217
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,397
你每天都问我  我也几乎每天说没有
You ask me that every day, and almost every day I say no.

218
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:38,937
我想告诉你  但这是个秘密
Look, I want to tell you, but it's a secret.

219
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,767
你不能告诉别人
And you can't tell anybody.

220
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,527
你真的觉得我会想跟任何人
Do you seriously think I would ever tell anyone

221
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,877
分享我这破生活的事吗
anything about this life?

222
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:46,347
好吧
Right.

223
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:49,227
我不知道怎么骑自行车  
I don't know how to ride a bike, okay?

224
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,397
你不知道怎么骑自行车吗
You don't know how to ride a bike?

225
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,767
麦克斯不知道怎么骑自行车吗
Max doesn't know how to ride a bike?

226
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,697
我靠  卡洛琳
Damn it, Caroline!

227
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,197
麦克斯不知道怎么骑自行车
Max doesn't know how to ride a bike.

228
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,487
完美的一天啊
Oh, happy day.

229
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,497
我终于有强过她的事情了
I finally have something over her.

230
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:03,557
世上真有神
There is a God,

231
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:06,237
而他也正在笑麦克斯呢
and he's laughing at her too.

232
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,027
天啊  我看不下去了
Lordy, this is harder to watch

233
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,777
比看金・凯瑞演的剧情片还难
than Jim Carrey in a drama.

234
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,777
{\an8}美国知名喜剧片演员  演出的喜剧深受观众喜爱
而出演的剧情片则大多褒贬不一

235
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,407
麦克斯  你没睡吧
Max, are you up?

236
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:27,107
怎么有股味儿  你打包了希腊菜回家吗
What's that smell? Did you bring home greek food?

237
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,977
没  那是我的味道
No, that's me.

238
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,767
我身上有这股味儿是因为我骑着自行车
That's how you smell after you ride a bike

239
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,447
跑遍整个威廉斯堡  送了14笔小蛋糕外卖
all over Williamsburg delivering 14 orders of cupcakes,

240
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,587
而我不希望身上再有这种味道了
And I do not wish to smell like this again,

241
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:40,457
所以你一定要学会骑自行车  知道吗
so you have to learn how to ride that bike, all right?

242
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,007
你以为你是谁啊  
Who do you think you are 

243
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,267
带着一股鹰嘴豆泥的味冲进来
busting in here smelling like hummus 

244
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:46,297
却没带鹰嘴豆泥给我吃
but having no hummus?

245
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:47,657
到底是怎么回事
What is the problem?

246
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,837
你妈难道没教过你怎么骑自行车吗
Didn't your mother ever teach you how to ride a bike?

247
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:53,407
没有  我妈忙着当公共自行车被人"骑"呢
No, my mother was too busy being the town bike.

248
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,507
那好吧  我来教你
Well, then I'll teach you.

249
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:56,137
不要  绝不骑自行车
Nope. Never getting on a bike.

250
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,747
这是我"三绝师太"其中一条原则
It's one of my three "nevers."

251
00:10:57,747 --> 00:10:59,107
是啊  你第一"绝"是
Yes, well, your first "never" was,

252
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,517
"绝不跟金发妞同住"
"Never having a blonde roommate."

253
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:06,207
小妞你一步一步似魔鬼般吞噬了我的原则啊
You are chipping away at me piece by piece, lady.

254
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,297
除非你告诉我原因  否则我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.

255
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:12,457
我本来想坐你的床  但那是你的第三"绝"
I'd sit on your bed, but that's your third "never."

256
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,357
在我小的时候  有个孩子叫汤米・杜南
When I was little, there was this kid, Tommy Doonan.

257
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:19,477
人很乖  跳房子游戏界的一哥
Nice kid, solid hopscotcher.

258
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,907
每天午餐都会把他的水果卷给我
Used to give me his fruit roll-up at lunch every day.

259
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,767
麦克斯  水果卷是他给你的
Max, did he give you these fruit roll-ups,

260
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,787
还是你自己抢的
or did you take them?

261
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:26,387
别插嘴
Don't interrupt.

262
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,447
有一天  汤米・杜南买了一辆新的自行车
One day, Tommy Doonan got a new bike.

263
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,237
他跟一位跟他长得很像  
He was out front with this nice, 

264
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:34,037
很亲切的老男人出来玩
older man who looked just like him.

265
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,347
你是指他的爸爸吗
You mean his dad?

266
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:38,707
应该这么称呼那人吗
Mm, is that what they call them?

267
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:40,977
我还以为是叫恋童怪老头呢
I assumed it was a predator.

268
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,367
总而言之  我当时在嘲笑他
So anyway, I was making fun of him

269
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,687
因为他看起来很开心
'cause he seemed happy.

270
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:49,437
我还以为你只对我这样呢
I thought that was our thing.

271
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,047
然后他开始显摆特技  前轮离地之类的
And he started showing off, doing wheelies and stuff,

272
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,367
想挫挫我的锐气
to put me in my place,

273
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,367
结果他从车把后面飞出去
But then he flipped up over the handlebars

274
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,437
重重摔在地上  脸先着地哦  
and came down hard on his face.

275
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:00,597
好可怜哦
Sad,

276
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:04,477
但不值得让我腋下骑出中东味儿
but not worth me having baklava pits.

277
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,717
还没说完呢
Well, wait.

278
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,647
我止住笑声后
After I stopped laughing

279
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:11,257
那男人把他扶起来  用恋童癖的方式拥抱他
and the man picked him up and hugged him predator-style,

280
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:15,737
我看见汤米的牙齿从脸颊冒出来
I saw Tommy's teeth had busted through his cheek.

281
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,277
说白了就是
To put it plainly,

282
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:21,367
他的嘴跑到他的脸外面了
his mouth was on the outside of his face.

283
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,597
感觉就是恐怖电影里的情节
Ew, that's like something out of a horror movie,

284
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:28,347
比如《自行车活死人》或《德州自行车链杀人狂》
like Bike of the Living Dead or Texas Bike Chain Massacre

285
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:28,347
{\an8}源自电影《活死人归来 The Return of the Living Dead》
以及《德州电锯杀人狂 Texas Chainsaw Massacre》

286
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,227
还有...算了  说够了
Or--well, that's probably enough.

287
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:34,557
之后只要我看见自行车  就会想到他的脸
Every time I see a bike, I think of his little face

288
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:37,967
还有他的小牙齿  咬出一条血路来的样子
and his little teeth chomping out the side of it.

289
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,937
他吃苹果都得这样
He had to eat apples like this...

290
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,377
麦克斯  这事错不在你
Max, you are not responsible for that.

291
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:47,187
我知道

12个陪审员中有1个也这么认为

谢谢你  6号陪审员

总之这事吓死我了  所以晚安啦
Anyway, it freaked me out, so good night.

295
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,487
不行  麦克斯
No, Max.

296
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,017
逃避不是办法
It is not going to work that way.

297
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,687
你一定要学怎么骑自行车
You're learning how to ride a bike.

298
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,877
我已经有一个痛苦的经期[自行车]了
I'm already on one painful cycle.

299
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,837
我不想再多要一个
I don't want to get on another one.

如果你骑自行车  我就给你四颗

306
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,887
你也不会骑自行车好吗
You don't know how to ride a bike either.

307
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,207
来吧  麦克斯  我们在巷子里练
Come on, Max, just out here in the alley.

308
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:30,267
我了个去

309
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,327

到处都被"毛线轰炸"过  感觉像"手工阿富汗"
There's so much yarn-bombing, it's like Craft-ganistan.

312
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,447
麦克斯  随它去吧
Max, let it go.

313
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,127
集中注意力
Stay focused.

314
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:42,937
骑上自行车

我不想用
I don't want to eat apples

317
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:47,447
我的脸颊吃苹果

00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,197
来吧  让我教你嘛
Come on. Let me teach you.

319
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,327

- Nope. - Want a Tootsie?

320
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:52,867
当然要啦
You know I do.

321
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,607
你也教会我怎么当穷鬼啊
I mean, you taught me how to be poor.

322
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,067
而且你当得越来越棒了
Eh, you're getting really good at it.

323
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,817
来嘛  你知道人们怎么说骑自行车吗
Come on. You know what they say about riding a bike.

324
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:03,577
感觉就像骑自行车  瞧
It's like riding a bike. See?

325

你的嘴巴很漂亮  卡洛琳
You got a real pretty mouth, Caroline.

327
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:12,607
真想看看它长在你脸颊的样子
Can't wait to see it on the side of your face.

328
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,387
至少你先坐到自行车上
At least just get on the bike.

329
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,957
不用骑  哪儿都不用去
You don't even have to go anywhere yet.

330
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,247
-不要  -要糖吗
- Nope. - Want a tootsie?

331
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,767

00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:20,197
上
Go.

333
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,037
这根杆子在这中间干嘛
What is this bar doing here?

334
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:26,147
一根不能让我醉的杆子[酒吧]有何用
I have no use for a bar that can't get me drunk.

335
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,587
走路把自行车带到那边
Okay, walk the bike over there

336
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,977
靠在那辆车上保持平衡
and lean against the car to get your balance.

337
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:32,477
一定要确保周围没人看见
Just check and make sure there's no one around.

338
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,347
你怕什么
Why do you care?

339
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,687
这么晚还在外面晃荡的人
The only people out here this late

340
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:36,877
不是强奸犯  就是杀人犯和怪人
would be rapists, murderers, and freaks...

341
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,037
都是你的朋友啊
you know, your peeps.

342
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:41,777
搞什么...
What the--

343
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,077
姑娘们
Hey, girls.

344
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,527
苏菲
Sophie?

345
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,207
你一个人在车里干嘛
What are you doing in that car alone?

346
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,627
半夜三点在一条漆黑的巷子里[站街女]
Oh, a dark alley at 3:00 A.M.?

347
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,347
你们有这么缺钱吗
Has money gotten that tight?

348
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,597
是啊  但我们出来不是这个原因
Yes, but that's not why we're out here.

349
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,027
我在教麦克斯骑自行车
I'm teaching Max how to ride a bike,

350
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,567
真是超级难教[硬]
and it's pretty hard.

351
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,927
真希望我也有你那样的烦恼
Oh, yeah, I wish I had that problem.

352
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:06,837
我在车里跟"软绳"奋斗呢
I'm dancing with a rope in here.

353
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:10,397
我们在尝试一些有异国风情的新做爱场所
We're trying some exotic, new locales for our lovemaking.

354
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:14,327
这里有异国风情  因为这不是我们的车
It's exotic because this isn't even our car.

355
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,687
我们得在犹太祭司回来前速战速决
We better hurry before that rabbi comes back.

356
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,527
再试试学狗叫吧
Maybe try barking at it again.

357
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,757
刚才好像有点反应
There was some movement earlier.

358
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,947
来吧  卡洛琳  快教我怎么骑着玩意
Come on, Caroline, teach me how to ride this thing.

359
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:29,527
我得远离犹太恶心会堂
I got to get away from Temple Gross Shalom

360
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,257
越快越好
as fast as possible.

361
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,637
好的  我在你后面
Okay, I'm gonna get behind you

362
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,137
扶着你的车座[屁股]
and hold on to your seat.

363
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,007
不先来三杯长岛冰茶
Not without three long island iced teas

364
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,627
外加一句"你的屁股看起来真不错"吗
and one, "your butt looks good in those jeans."

365
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:40,337
-要糖吗  -要
- Tootsie? - Yeah.

366
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,137
麦克斯  不要看
Max, don't look.

367
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,447
毛线轰炸又来了吗
Yarn-bombing?

368
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:45,977
麦克斯
hey, Max.

369
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:46,927
阿憨
Han?

370
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,547
我只是在骑自行车去自行车店
I'm just riding my bike to the bike store

371
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,547
再买几辆自行车
to buy more bikes.

372
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:52,027
那是阿憨吗  
Is that Han or

373
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:54,477
还是禁药车神兰斯・阿姆斯特朗切除的睾丸
Lance Armstrong's runaway testicle?

374
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:55,837
{\an8}美国公路自行车赛职业车手  曾得过睾丸癌

375
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:55,837
抱歉  我听不见哦
Sorry, couldn't hear you.

376
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:59,297
我忙着显摆怎么骑自行车呢
I was too busy knowing how to ride a bike.

377
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,747
妈的  逼着我一定要学会
Damn it! Now I got to do this.

378
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,527
你知道我们生活的社会将会崩溃得多快
You know how quickly society will crumble around us

379
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,647
如果阿憨开始觉得他可以随意嘲笑我吗
if Han starts feeling like he can freely tease me?

380
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,217
来吧
Let's go!

381
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,027
-你确定吗  -确定
- You sure? - Yep.

382
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,067
取笑阿憨
Making fun of Han

383
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,437
是我两个免费娱乐来源中的一个

384
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:16,087
另一项则位在这横杠的正上方
The other one is located right above this bar.

385
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:17,887
好了  我的手会扶着车座
Okay, I'll keep my hand on the seat,

386
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:20,187
当你觉得可以了  告诉我  我就松手
and then when you're ready, tell me, and I'll let you go.

387
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,877
好的  我没说不准松手哦
Okay, but don't let go until I say so.

388
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:24,757
好了  松手吧
Okay, let go.

389
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:26,037
松开了
Already did.

390

我在骑自行车呢
I'm riding a bike?

391
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,267
麦克斯  小心  前面有坑
Max, look out! Pothole!

392
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:37,807
我另一个免费娱乐来源也没了
There goes my other free source of entertainment.

393
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,317
要糖吗
Tootsie?

394
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,807
废话  当然要啦
Yes, obviously!

395
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,801
10号桌上菜  麦克斯
Table ten. Pick up, Max.

396
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,151
好  马上过来
Yeah, be right there.

397
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,531
大概需要一个月的时间吧
Like, you know, in a month.

398
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,491
麦克斯  你还好吗
Uh, Max, how you doing?

399
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:01,341
我听说你出"阴祸"了
I heard about your vag-accident.

400
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,231
如果你需要看医生
Look, if you need to see a doctor,

401
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,791
我佛罗里达州的表姐不错
my cousin in Florida is a good one,

402
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,821
但话说回来  我怕你撑不过这一路上的颠簸
but then again, the bumpy bus ride might kill you.

403
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,811
不用了  没事的  厄尔
No, no, it'll be fine, Earl.

404
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,441
我在冰敷呢  保持冰镇就好
I'm icing it. I just have to keep it cold.

405
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,141
我们没生姜汁汽水了
We're out of ginger ale.

406
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,921
你的意思是你生了姜汁汽水吧
I think you mean the ginger ale is out of you.

407
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,501
麦克斯  我帮你捡吧
Max, let me get that for you.

408
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,401
我觉得这也算我的错吧
I feel like it was kind of my fault.

409
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,291
也算
Kind of?

410
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,401
林肯的死
Was Lincoln's death

411
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,941
约翰・威尔克斯・布斯也算是有错吗
kind of John Wilkes Booth's fault?

412
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,941
{\an8}刺杀林肯的凶手

413
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,021
上菜了  卡洛琳
Pick up, Caroline.

414
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,701
你跟苏菲怎么样了
How'd it go with Sophie?

415
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,911
"事情"如何了  就是男人"忙"得满身大汗
Were you able to do the thing, you know, the man does

416
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:46,811
而女人在脑子里想着要买啥的那件事
while the woman makes shopping lists in her head?

417
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:48,401
不要说出来嘛
Shh. Come on.

418
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,211
我不想让其他人知道我"抬不起头"
I don't want anyone to know I can't get it up.

419
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,341
奥列格硬不起来吗
Oleg can't get it up?

420
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,061
天啊  奥列格硬不起来

怎么了[什么起来了]
What's up?

424
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,801
肯定不是你的男朋友
Not your boyfriend.

425
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,411
如果找我有事
If anyone needs me,

426
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,391
我就在外面骑自行车呢
I'll be outside riding my bike

427
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,451
边"硬"边骑哦
with an erection.

428
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,451
不  不  不  肯定不是我告诉他的
Oh, no, no, no, no. He didn't hear it from me.

429
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,231
我只告诉两个人
I only told two people--

430
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:25,241
麦克斯和我的越南美甲师明华
Max and my manicurist, Ming Wa.

431
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,821
你不用担心她
And you don't have to worry about her

432
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,851
因为她什么都不放在心上
because she doesn't care about anything

433
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:32,571
除了她那位名叫"金枪・不倒"的爱人
except loving some guy named Long Time.

434
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,421
苏菲  宝贝
Sophie, baby,

435
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:39,121
这太难了
this is hard.

436
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:41,901
是啊  或许我们还是别太认真的好
Yeah, maybe we better not try to be serious.

437
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,261
我是说  事实真相是
I mean, the real truth is,

438
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:47,841
我爱的不是你  是你的"耀武扬威之物"
I only like you for your penis anyway.

439
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,031
再说一遍
Say that again.

440
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:53,271
说什么  说我喜欢你是因为你的胯下巨蟒吗
What, that I only like you for your penis?

441
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,281
再说一遍
One more time.

442
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,121
说什么  说其实我对你没什么爱
Well, what, that I don't have any real feelings for you?

443
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,971
我们之间只是肉体关系
That it's completely sexual

444
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,771
我只是喜欢你又大又笨的神雕吗
and I only like you for your big, stupid penis?

445
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,611
我又能一柱擎天了  宝贝
I'm back, baby.

446
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,631
苏菲  你能进厨房一下吗
Sophie, can I see you in the kitchen?

447
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,981
我们最好快点  我在做三分钟煮蛋呢
And we better hurry. I'm making three-minute eggs.

448
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,051
我的蛋不要了
Cancel my eggs.

449
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,001
本来他们谈话时  我是非常想离开
I would've so left during that whole conversation,

450
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:23,371
但我的双腿正夹着一罐胡椒博士的汽水
but I'm holding a can of Dr. Pepper between my legs.

451
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,301
干嘛  他是个博士[医生]  什么没见过啊
What? He's a doctor. He's seen it.

452
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,311
我觉得咱俩扯平了
Well, I think we're pretty much even.

453
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:32,581
你的腿骑车骑得有点酸  而我以后生不出孩子
Your legs are a little sore, and I'll never have children.

454
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:36,051
所以我想说一声谢谢你
So I guess what I'm saying is thanks.

455
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,631
你真的不想重新骑上自行车吗
So you really don't want to get back on the bike?

456
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,071
你就这么放弃了吗
You're just gonna give up?

457
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:43,951
我打赌就连汤米・杜南也敢再骑自行车
I bet even Tommy Doonan got back on the bike.

458
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,281
他后来怎么样了
Whatever happened to him?

459
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,251
我在脸书上见过他
I caught up with him on Facebook.

460
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:50,411
更像是"脸输"得一塌糊涂
Well, more like really-messed-up-face-book.

461
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,781
他婚姻幸福美满
He's happily married.

462
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,951
我打赌他现在肯定开着他的车
I bet right now he's driving his car,

463
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,261
两眼直视前方 
looking straight ahead, 

464
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,211
嘴巴冲着副驾驶座的妻子微笑呢
and smiling at his wife in the seat next to him.

465
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,911
所以我们的外送事业结束了吗
So that's it for deliveries?

466
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:04,871
你可以去外送  随时随地我都欢迎
Oh, you can deliver wherever and whenever you want,

467
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,251
但我是绝对不可能再骑那辆自行车了
but there is no way I am ever getting on that bike again.

468
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:12,581
麦克斯  快看  滚娘
Max, look. Guinevere.

469
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,941
我了个大去
Oh, hell no!

470
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:18,171
她毛线轰炸了我们的马棚
She yarn-bombed our darn barn!

471
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,991
你俩当时真应该给小费
You two should've tipped.

472
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,651
我是一名艺术家
I'm an artist.

473
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:25,591
尝尝我的毛线针吧  贱人们
Eat my stitches, bitches.

474
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,171
那一点都不算有奇思妙想啊
That was not whimsical at all.

475
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,491
快把自行车给我
Give me the damn bike.

476
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,631
那编织疯婆准备领死吧
Knit's about to hit the fan.

477
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,531
麦克斯  你做到了
Max, you're doing it.

478
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,321
你不是害怕骑自行车吗
What happened to your fear of bikes?

479
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:44,191
我想我对那疯婆子的憎恨比恐惧更强大吧
I guess the only thing stronger is my hatred of that nerd!

480
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:57,991
{\an1}{\pos(10,101.6)}翻译的时候 我们注释是怕观众不理解笑点 不是为了做美国生活科普单元
有些以前注释过或者剧情出现过 通常也不会再注释一遍... 也是要边看边学习嘛
所以别再问我 为什么把401的tinder翻成陌陌 
因为我懒得多在上面注释这软件是干啥的 要怎么用 界面是怎么样... 
也别问我为啥魔力红成了五月天 因为魔力红的3/5没啥中文哏 
而五月天名字里有个五 就这么简单                                                   ――赛太公
