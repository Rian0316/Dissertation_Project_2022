1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,720
孩子 千万不要低估命运的力量
Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,550
因为只要你对命运还有期待
Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,950
哪怕微不足道的事情也能 给你生活带来 意想不到的变化
can cause a ripple effect that changes your life.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,820
象我当年去芝加哥
Take for instance my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,640
那个保安有点咸猪手
That security guard was a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,530
搞笑 她只是碰了下我
That's funny. She barely touched me.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,810
23号登机口  快点
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,410
如果我们错过了这趟班机 我永远不会原谅自己的
If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,970
这趟班机为什么如此重要?
Why was this flight so important?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,140
让我们回到几个月前 那是06年秋天
Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,720
我刚刚卖掉第一份建筑设计图纸
I had just sold my first building design and become

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,520
并且成为了我们 公司历史上最年轻的经理
the youngest project manager in my firm's history.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,750
瞬时  我成为众猎头公司的目标
Suddenly I was being headhunted.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,330
一家公司甚至考虑 让我管理他们纽约办事处
One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,480
他们安排我参加最后一道面试
They were flying me in for a final interview

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,540
在他们的芝加哥总部
at their corporate headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,490
这是一生中的少有的机会
It was the opportunity of a lifetime.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,930
这会决定我的命运
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,670
但是有一个问题
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,800
等等 还有两个人
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,640
对不起 你们迟到太久了 我已经关上登机门了
Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,900
能不能通融通融
Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,840
我也希望你们能进去 门一旦关上 就没有办法了
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it.

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,000
每人能够在下到登机舱
Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way.

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,170
除了这个人
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,330
求求你了 如果 我说如果我错过这趟航班
Please, if-if I miss this flight,

27
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,330
我就错过我梦寐以求 的工作面试机会
 I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.

28
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,460
对不起 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

29
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,670
他梦寐以求的工作! 难道你没有过梦寐以求的工作?
His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job?

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,000
你还是小女孩的时候 有一些东西 让你就是想去做
Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do?

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,180
我的意思是 肯定是这样的 你晚上从不睡觉
I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

32
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,780
做做梦成为
dreaming about being a...

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,150
我的意思是
I mean, uh...

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,260
这是个不错的工作
This is a cool job.

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,060
求你了 我必须上这趟飞机
Please, I have to be on this flight.

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,450
我看看我能做什么
I'll see what I can do.

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,850
但是目前看起来不妙
But it doesn't look good.

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,760
谢谢
Thanks.

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,600
你的制服真漂亮
Your uniforms are pretty.

45
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,430
好的
Okay.

46
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,900
他们还没有关登机门 你们还有一线机会
They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance.

47
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,270
现在已经联系上机长了 他们会再跟我们联系
It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,470
太好了 请尽快告诉 我们如果你有信的话
Great, please let us know soon as you hear anything.

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,710
为了避免再次出现类是情况 我们建议你们
Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,330
提前一个半小时到机场
at the airport an hour and a half before your flight,

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,280
而不是  晚一分钟才到
not, you know, one minute after.

52
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,960
平时 我总是十分守时的
Normally, I'm incredibly responsible.

53
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,290
我今早去了趟法院 然后等待判决
I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced.

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,850
我不是犯罪分子  一点关系都没有
Not that I'm a criminal or anything.

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,880
他只是跳了下地铁十字转门
Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.

56
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,170
你看起来对交通规则理解有很多问题
You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel.

57
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,060
你好?
Hello?

58
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,890
噢 太好了
Oh, that is great news.

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,990
我妈妈打来的 她找到她丢的耳环了
It's my mom-- she found her missing earring.

60
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,000
坐吧 我一有消息就叫你们
Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something.

61
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,290
在那找到的?
Where was it?

62
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,900
这件对她来说比等回话好多了
That thing better have call waiting.

63
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,480
你能给公司打个电话 解释下发生了什么吗?
Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?

64
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,820
那可是3个人
It's down to three people

65
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,990
并且我知道他们 今天就要做出最后决定
and I know they need to make their decision today.

66
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,380
我感觉我没露面 会给我带来竞争上的劣势
I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage.

67
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,260
我太笨了
I'm so stupid.

68
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,370
我为什么要去跳转门?
Why did I have to jump that turnstile?

69
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,070
别这样怪自己了
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,950
难道整件事不该怪巴尼?
And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?

71
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,420
她说的对
She had a point.

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,220
从某种意义来说是巴尼的错
It was kind of Barney's fault.

73
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,010
让我们再回到几个月前
Let's back up a few months.

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,620
马修 脚趾怎么样了?
Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?

75
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,220
天啊 疼死我了
Oh,  man, it kills.

76
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,820
要来点阿司匹林吗 宝贝?
You want some aspirin, baby?

77
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,940
你知道我不喜欢止疼药的
You know I don't believe in pain killers.

78
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,310
你第一次骨折
Wow, your first broken bone.

79
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,210
打破了你从不"骨折"的历史
Kind of kills your whole "Unbreakable" theory.

80
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,920
马修曾经一度 以为他是不会受伤的
Marshall used to think he was indestructible.

81
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,400
打住 我之前从来没有骨折过
Well, it added up. I've never broken anything.

82
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,060
从来没有生过病  而且当我需要时
I've never been sick, and when I need to,

83
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,560
我能获得无穷的力量
I can summon incredible strength.

84
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,340
泰德 告诉她 关于沉重的门的故事
Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.

85
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,210
确实有个很重的门
There was a really heavy door.

86
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,620
他打开了
He opened it.

87
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,800
还是一只手
On one pull.

88
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,320
你现在肯定不行了 明天你也不能去跑步了
Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

89
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,730
是啊 太郁闷了
Yeah. It sucks,

90
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,110
所有的马拉松训练都成无用功了
all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.

91
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,050
马拉松训练?
Training for a marathon.

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,540
怎么了?
What?

93
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,380
马拉松根本不需要训练 跑就得了
You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.

94
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,170
你开玩笑?
You're kidding, right?

95
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,940
本来就是 我想什么时候跑马拉松都行
Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.

96
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,890
那明天 你认为你醒来 起床后
So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed,

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,670
就直接去参加纽约马拉松赛?
and just run the New York City Marathon?

98
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,860
没问题
Absolutely.

99
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,920
巴尼  我们说的可是42公里
Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.

100
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,380
好的  我接着说
Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here.

101
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,530
巴尼 看起来有26迈远
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

102
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,370
我来告诉你们怎么跑马拉松
Here's how you run a marathon.

103
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,990
第一步 起跑
Step one, you start running.

104
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,240
然后就 没有了
There is no step two.

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
你懂啥啊 证明给我们看
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,920
拿我的号去跑
Take my number and run in my place.

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,320
我赌50美元你根本跑不完比赛
I will bet you 50 bucks you don't even finish the race.

108
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,670
50美元?
50 bucks?

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,560
要是我赢了
Gee,  Grandpa, if I win,

110
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,110
我可能可以买个冰淇淋
maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone.

111
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,740
赌 10,000美元
Make it $10,000.

112
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,100
你赌不赌?你输了也要给我50美元
You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.

113
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,580
那就不赌了
Fine, then no bet.

114
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,060
好吧 50美元就50美元
Okay, $50.

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,830
第二天一早  马拉松开始
The next morning, as the marathon began,

116
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,030
我们就都把注意力放在马修的电脑上
we were focused on Marshall's computer.

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
每一个选手都有个追踪芯片 你可以在网上跟着他们
Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online,

118
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,610
当他们过了检查 巴尼的鞋上就会有我的芯片信号
see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.

119
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,570
他开跑了
Ooh, he's starting!

120
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,520
看起来很好
This ought to be good.

121
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,930
噢
Wow.

122
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,050
他已经过了第二个检查站了
He's already passing the second checkpoint.

123
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,460
这个追踪器太好了
This tracking thing is amazing.

124
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,820
我们结婚了以后都得有一个
When we get married, you're getting one of these.

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,590
看他的时间 太快了
Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,700
他肯定在做假
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

127
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,920
他知道我们在看他
He knew we'd check.

128
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,540
他会不惜余力来赢这次赌
Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet.

129
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,000
记得那次他和我 打赌让那男的唱"饿狼传说"
Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

130
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,610
他们不唱  然后他花钱让他们唱
and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?

131
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,050
看起来 "巴尼"应该要过Queensboro桥了
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

132
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,300
一个小时后会到达第一大道
and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But...

133
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,850
但是  这不可能是他
there is no way that that's really him.

134
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,330
真的是他啊
It's really him.

135
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,950
嘿 那是我的
Hey! That's mine.

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,060
也好 你最好是逃跑
Yeah, you'd better run!

137
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,290
怎么样啊 失败者?
- What up, non-finishers? - Wow.

138
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,590
太出色了 巴尼 不是吗?
- Very impressive, Barney. - Right?

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,430
我本来应该在提前半个小时的
Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better,

140
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,420
跑到7迈的时候 遇到热水瓶了我们抄近道
but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

141
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,990
我们的迷你马拉松 就在内森的后面
and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,190
我赢了
I won.

143
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,780
我不觉得任何人 是赌局的赢家
I'm  not sure anyone in that story is a winner.

144
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,050
我的50美元呢?
So where's my 50 bucks?

145
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,340
好吧
All right.

146
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,340
我承认 你赢了
I got to admit, you earned this.

147
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,140
他们怎么没做个50美元的硬币
Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet.

148
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,140
好了 我回家了
Anyway, I'm heading home.

149
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,090
也许还要去趟健身房
Might go hit the gym.

150
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,990
等等 跟你说 所有马拉松参赛者都可以
Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
今天免费坐地铁
to use the subway for free today.

152
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,090
我真的应该去看看"兔女郎"
Wow. You know I really should check out this "subway."

153
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,460
听说了那么多
Heard so much about it.

154
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,840
看着我 佩服吧
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

155
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,700
也许  我会拿一周出来
Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it

156
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,190
今晚嘛 就找个一般的了
and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.

157
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,290
你今晚和新泽西的女孩约会?
You're dating a girl from New Jersey?

158
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,630
当然不
No.

159
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,860
巴尼真做到了
So Barney did it.

160
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,320
他确实完成了马拉松
He actually finished the marathon.

161
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,770
但过了一会 我接到了一个有趣的电话
But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.

162
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,480
你好? 泰德 我 巴尼
- Hello? - Ted, it's Barney.

163
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,910
我需要你来地铁站接我
Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.

164
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,650
怎么了 你说什么呢?
What, what are you talking about?

165
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,560
我就坐在这 正在想我的好事
I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.

166
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,050
胜利者
Finisher.

167
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,180
你知道我再说啥
Yeah, you know what I mean.

168
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,180
86号街到了
86th street.

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,030
我脚动不了了
My legs don't work.

170
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,060
我已经在地铁上 坐了整整两个来回了
I've already ridden the subway twice end to end.

171
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,150
我没有发现有所好转
I've seen where it turns around.

172
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,640
泰德  你一定不想看到地铁来回转
Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.

173
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,250
巴尼的脚动不了了
Barney's legs won't work.

174
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,870
他下不了地铁了
He's riding the subway from end to end

175
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
因为他身体上已经已经不能下车了
because he physically can't get off the train.

176
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,030
这是我花的最好的50美元
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

177
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,490
听我说 泰德
Listen to me, Ted.

178
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,490
你快过来我等不及了 我在6号车的4号车厢
I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train

179
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,810
从布鲁克斯区的帕港往南开
heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.

180
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,730
在86号街站等我 半个小时内能到吗?
Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?

181
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,850
好的  我这就去
All right. I'll be right there.

182
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,410
呆在那别动
Stay where you are.

183
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,270
泰德  泰德
Ted, Ted.

184
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,640
你不会连他位置都不让
Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?

185
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,790
对不起  我不能让
I'm sorry. I can't.

186
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,140
脑子进水了
Douche.

187
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,380
巴尼? 泰德!
- Barney?! - Ted!

188
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,870
嘿 站住
Hey!

189
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,640
不要...
No...!

190
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,530
明白了吗?如果巴尼不参加马拉松
See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon,

191
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,280
你就不会跳转门
you never would have jumped that turnstile,

192
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,320
你今天也不会去法院
you wouldn't have had that court date today,

193
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,030
我们就可以赶上航班
and we would have made this flight.

194
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,330
你说的对
You're right.

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,190
所有事都归罪于他
Everything can be traced back to him.

196
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,130
象当时圣诞的轻率一样
Like that rash we all got at Christmas.

197
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,860
好吧 我看看怎么样了
All right, I have to see what's going on.

198
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,870
- 那我能帮你订到两个 - 真的吗? 那太好了!
- So I was able to get you two seats. - Really? That's great!

199
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,740
不 没跟你说 我再跟我妈说Blue Man组合的门票
No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group.

200
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,150
妈 我再给你打过来好吗?
Ma, can I call you back?

201
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,240
我们的航班怎么样? 我们能登机了吗?
Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,640
我还在等...
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

203
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,910
看起来你们的航班已经起飞了
Looks like your flight left already.

204
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,540
什么?不 不 不... 我今天必须得到芝加哥
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.

205
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,070
那机长就根本没有给你打过来?
Well, he never even called you back?

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,670
这才是典型飞行员 工作时绝不回电
Well, it's typical pilot. They don't call you back at work

207
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,770
他们打过来除非你们
and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them

208
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,490
在奥兰多 Radisson 和他们渡过两晚
at a Radisson in Orlando.

209
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,840
事情有了转机 正好有另外一趟航班
It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me

210
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,220
能让我及时 去芝加哥参加工作面试
to Chicago on time for my job interview,

211
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,820
但是登机口在机场的另外一头
but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.

212
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,850
是哪个航空公司的航班
What was the name of the airline again?

213
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,710
好像是R'Us 航空公司
I think it was something like Flights R' Us.

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,830
"R"是在后面吗? (同音:我们赶不上了)
Was the "R" backwards?

215
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,170
老天 希望不是
God, I hope not.

216
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,600
快啊 好手推车
- Geez. - Stupid smart carts.

217
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,840
更像笨推车
More like dumb carts.

218
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,250
如果我们错过航班 一定都是巴尼的过错
If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.

219
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,780
巴尼决不可能在马拉松跑第一
You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place

220
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,090
如果马修脚趾没有骨折的话 那难道不是?
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe. - Yeah, so?

221
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,270
那你觉得是我的过错?
What, you think this is my fault?

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,750
对马修来说  参加马拉松 的想法的产生在四月
For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.

223
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,790
我的内裤穿起来有点紧了
My pants are starting to feel a little tight.

224
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,390
没关系  我喜欢你的小肚腩
Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.

225
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,090
我不能再这样下去了
I cannot allow this.

226
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,290
怎么了啊?
What?

227
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
我要去参加纽约马拉松赛
I am going to run the New York City Marathon.

228
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,210
碳水化合物摄入很重要
"It is important to load up on carbohydrates

229
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,170
在长跑2-4个小时之前
two to four hours before a big run.

230
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,550
早餐一个百吉饼 一个香蕉
Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana,

231
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,520
麦片 草莓 和一些橙汁
oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."

232
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,270
过来吃吧 马修这些食物 都按照书上说的弄的
Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.

233
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,100
但从现在起 我要 象职业选手一样吃早餐
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style.

234
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,030
液体消化要快得多
Liquids are digested faster.

235
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,050
换句话说 没有能量流失
That way, no energy is wasted,

236
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,710
这些都是为了比赛
and it's all about the run.

237
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,850
别忘了给自己很多鼓励
"Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement."

238
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,990
这会是你最好的比赛
This is gonna be your best run yet.

239
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,460
你会实现你所有的梦想
You're going to accomplish all of your goals.

240
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,950
你是一个来自未来的机器人
You are a robot sent from the future

241
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,870
为了赢得马拉松
to win the marathon!

242
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,020
你是...马修
You are... Marshall.

243
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,810
你是...马修
You are... Marshall.

244
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,020
你是...马修!
You are Marshall! Yeah!

245
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,270
身上一些地方也许会出现发炎或者水泡
"Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas,

246
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,900
出现的地方包括脚 腋窝 甚至乳头
including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples.

247
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,820
试试在这些有反应的地方用些油霜
Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas."

248
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,190
噢  糟了!
Oh, gosh!

249
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,600
兄弟 你是一个所向披靡的选手
Dude, you are a terrific runner.

250
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,570
明天你将参加并且完成纽约马拉松
Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon!

251
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,610
你是最棒的
You're the best.

252
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
你看起来太好了
You look good.

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
没人比你更强
Nobody does it better than you.

254
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,410
马修?我的天!
Marshall? Oh, my God!

255
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,040
这样说 是 确实是你的错
So, yes, it was your fault.

256
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,320
我的意思是 如果你中午不突然去我公寓的话
I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day,

257
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,010
马修脚趾就不会骨折 巴尼也不会带他去跑
Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place,

258
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,880
我也不会去跳转门和法院
I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date,

259
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,140
我们就有足够的时间来赶上飞机
and we make our flight in plenty of time!

260
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,020
我也不会在机场摔到还咬伤舌头
And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.

261
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,810
这真的不是我的错
That really wasn't my fault.

262
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,370
如果不是因为 莉莉我也不会撞见马修
I wouldn't have walked in on Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

263
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,780
你想想...
Hey,  think about it.

264
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,790
那怎么了?
Hey, what's going on here?

265
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,840
不知道 看起来 他们象在露营什么的
Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.

266
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,170
对啊 可为什么啊?
Yeah, but for what?

267
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,410
不知道  经常有突击队迷 或者星战迷来通宵排队
I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

268
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,140
看来这是原因了
to give you some indication.

269
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,970
"年度婚纱甩卖"
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

270
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,140
设计样品试穿打9折
Designer sample dresses up to 90% off.

271
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,210
明天早上8点开门
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

272
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,350
你相信这些真能省钱?
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

273
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,510
我们一定要露营
We have to camp out.

274
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,390
- 你说真的吗? - 你不懂
- Are you serious? - You don't understand.

275
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,810
太划算得甩卖了 我从来没有遇到过
This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before,

276
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,810
我从来不知道哪有这些
but I never knew where it was.

277
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,420
我们将来个婚纱露宿 一定很有趣...
We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.

278
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,690
我不能去 我有事
I can't go. I've got this thing.

279
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,880
- 什么事? - 房事
- What thing? - A penis.

280
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,790
就是这了
- This is the place. - Oh, wow.

281
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,880
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! (服装品牌)
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

282
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,160
Vera Wang! (华裔婚纱设计师)
Vera Wang!

283
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,240
你知道我们为什么在这?
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?

284
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,000
你说了Wang (发音错了)
You said wang.

285
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,410
它让我想到了1998年排队买Lilith Fair的票 (音乐会)
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

286
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,220
没有 胭脂鱼 (骂人的话)
Only fewer mullets.

287
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,010
你应该感到满足 你是纽约 仅有的10分之1最疯狂的新娘
You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,950
真舒服
Ooh, this is comfy.

289
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,420
我们肯定能睡着
We might actually be able to sleep.

290
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,520
真让人讨厌
That's kind of annoying.

291
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,790
我确定呆会就有人出来把它关了
Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.

292
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,430
我觉得我不能忍受了
I don't think I can take this.

293
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,890
每次它声音一变小
Every time it turns off, I think,

294
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,890
它也许就不会再响了
oh, maybe it won't turn on again,

295
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,120
但是它又响了
but then it does.

296
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,650
为什么会这样 罗宾?
Why does it, Robin?

297
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,840
为什么它总响个不停
Why does it keep turning on?

298
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,890
会好的 甜心 为什么
It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why...

299
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,670
为什么我们不能 来玩个游戏? 怎么样?
Why  don't we make a game out of it, okay?

300
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,240
我们跟着它一起唱歌吧?
Why don't we sing along?

301
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,970
如果我们能做到的话
If we get through this,

302
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,450
我发誓我一定会过另一种生活
I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.

303
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,760
我只想对我父母 说再说一次我爱他们
I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.

304
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,060
早上好 女士们
Morning, ladies.

305
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,020
就是他 他就是车主! 滚开...
- It's him. It's the car guy! - Get out of here!

306
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,660
第二天早晨 罗宾累得不想回布鲁克林
The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

307
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,990
而我又在上班
so while I was at work,

308
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,570
她就去我公寓呆上两个小时
she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours,

309
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,890
然后
and that's when...

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,370
没人比你更强
Nobody does it better than you.

311
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,030
马修?!天啊!
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

312
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,590
如果莉莉不唆使我一起去婚纱店
So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store,

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,300
我们能赶上第一趟飞机
we would have made the first flight.

314
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,990
谢天谢地 门还开着 我们赶上了
Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it.

315
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,100
你好 求求你了 我们一定得上这趟班机
Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.

316
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,170
噢 天啊!
Oh, my God!

317
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,600
你是城市新闻1台的播音员
You're that reporter from Metro News 1.

318
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,360
是 是 我就是
Yes, yes, I am.

319
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,340
你居然能认出我
I can't believe you recognized me.

320
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,750
你编的大比萨饼的故事? 你能说说...
- You did that story on the giant pizzas? - Would you check to see

321
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,080
- 还有空位? - 等会 先生
- if you have any more seats? - One moment, sir.

322
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,060
那些比萨饼是真的?不是吧?
Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?

323
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,300
罗宾...等会 泰德
- Robin... - One second, Ted.

324
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,380
很多人问我同样的问题
Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that.

325
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,710
事实是 比萨饼是真的
The truth is, the pizzas were real.

326
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,790
- 馅是假的 图像处理过的 - 我就知道是这样的
- Calzones. Trick photography. - I knew it!

327
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,790
遇到一个粉丝太高兴了
God, it is so nice to meet a fan!

328
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,120
我也很开心成为你的粉丝 如果你能帮我们
And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us

329
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,820
在下趟航班留两个座位的话
two seats on that next flight.

330
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,680
乘务员刚刚检查完位置
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count.

331
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,620
让我看看能发现什么
Let me see what I can find out.

332
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,350
如果能帮忙赶上的话 我就能做一个关于我命运的激情演讲?
Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?

333
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,890
我觉得情况可能不好
I think it might hurt.

334
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,310
真是一场噩梦
This is such a nightmare.

335
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,440
好 统一意见? 回到莉莉想露营
Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out

336
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,750
因为婚纱...
for a wedding dress?

337
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,550
不
No.

338
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,570
等等 回去更远些
Wait. It goes back further.

339
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,520
记得我们为什么在东边吃热狗?
Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,150
1939年?!
1939?!

341
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,210
这是枚1939年造的便士!
This penny's from 1939!

342
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,000
有67年历史的便士
A 67-year-old penny.

343
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,930
你能想到这枚便士 是二次大战时造的吗?
Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?

344
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,260
就是我的祖父 这个也不让他感兴趣
Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.

345
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,070
我懂一些硬币知识
Look,  I know a little something about coins,

346
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,110
这个宝贝对于收藏家来说还是值钱的
and this baby is worth something to a collector.

347
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,260
- 不 它啥也不是 - 不 它肯定值钱!
- No, it's not. - Yes, it is!

348
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,560
你知道什么?我带你去吃饭
You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner

349
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,300
用这个便士换来的钱
with the money I get for this little guy.

350
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,770
这就是我做得
And that's exactly what I did.

351
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,390
你真走运还有这么个 地方把这个换成15美元
You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.

352
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,460
这可是它本身价值的150倍啊
Hey, that's 150 times its original value.

353
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,010
这顿饭只花了14.9美元
Actually, the meal was only $1.49.

354
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,530
1984造的
1984.

355
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,340
50年之内了 我们又可以吃了
Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.

356
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,900
你太过分了
How dare you.

357
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,810
嘿 那怎么了?
Hey, what's going on?

358
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,500
不知道 看起来 他们象在露营什么的
I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.

359
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,000
对啊 可为什么啊?
Yeah, but for what?

360
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,200
是我
It was me.

361
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,130
我开始了这一切
I started this.

362
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,060
如果我不捡那一便士
If I hadn't picked up that penny,

363
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,940
我们就不会沿路吃热狗
we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.

364
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,400
我们就不会看到婚纱店
And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store,

365
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,360
莉莉也不会想在那露营
Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there,

366
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,580
我也不会第二天去你公寓休息
and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.

367
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,840
马修脚趾也不会骨折
Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe.

368
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,000
巴尼也不会去跑马拉松
Barney wouldn't have run the marathon.

369
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,020
我也不会去跳转门
I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile,

370
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,540
被捕 还去法院
gotten arrested, had that court date...

371
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
我们就能赶上航班了
And we would have made our flight.

372
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,300
我认为我们 不能再追回到更远了
I don't think we can go back any further than that

373
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,050
除非你知道谁丢的那一便士
unless you know who dropped the penny.

374
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,480
我希望是我
I wish I did.

375
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,380
反正那人已经得到了惩罚了
Though that person's already been punished enough,

376
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,080
丢了那么值钱的一便士
losing a sweet penny like that.

377
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,960
先生?
Uh, sir?

378
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,670
请你告诉我点好消息
Oh, please tell me you have some good news.

379
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,480
恐怕不行
Uh, I'm afraid not.

380
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,550
这趟航班没有空位了
There are no extra seats on the plane.

381
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,850
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,720
算了吧  还是谢谢你尽力了
All, right, well, thanks for trying.

383
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,740
我不敢相信
I can't believe this.

384
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,530
晚了 都完了
That's it, it's over.

385
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,050
泰德 别这样
Ted, come on.

386
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,440
你命运就是今天到不了芝加哥
Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today.

387
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,390
如果哪个公司真要你的话 他们会重新安排的
Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.

388
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,260
但这再也没有发生过
But that's not what happened.

389
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,070
他们没有重新安排
They didn't reschedule.

390
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,950
他们雇了别人
They hired someone else.

391
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,500
三个月 这一切都过去了
And as it turned out, three months later,

392
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,790
那个家伙的纽约工作 也结束了又回到了芝加哥
that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago.

393
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,180
孩子们 这就是命运的趣事
Kids, funny thing about destiny--

394
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,660
我曾经认为 我一定会得到这份工作
I thought I was destined to get that job.

395
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,990
但我错了
But I was wrong.

396
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,570
我的命运是呆在纽约
My destiny was to stay in New York.

397
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,830
因为如果我没有
Because if I hadn't,

398
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,990
我就不会遇见你们的妈妈
I never would have met your mother.
