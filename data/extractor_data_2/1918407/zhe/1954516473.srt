1
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,330
Hey, you guys ready to order?

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,970
- Uh, sure. - Okay, Priya?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,650
Uh, I'll have the shepherd's pie.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,580
You want to split that with me?

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,330
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,770
Why not?

8
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,070
Well, you have milk in the taters,

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,050
milk in the gravy, parmesan crust.

10
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,710
Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn

11
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,750
into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.

12
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,860
Not quite accurate.

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,070
The Macy's balloons are filled with helium,

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,400
whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,250
So, no, on the shepherd's pie.

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,880
Can we move on?

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,790
Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yogurt.

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,520
Do not believe it.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,210
Sea bass! I'll have the sea bass!

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,050
You gotta like this,

21
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,410
the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,640
over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.

23
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,670
Kill me.

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,080
It wouldn't help. The human body is capable

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,790
of being flatulent for hours after death.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,130
Guys, sorry I'm late.

27
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,250
I have amazing news.

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,170
Bernadette, before you change the subject,

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,020
does anyone have any final comments on

30
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,990
Leonard's faulty digestive system?

31
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,860
So, what's your news, Bernadette?

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,650
The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation.

33
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm getting my PhD!

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,770
Wow! Oh, congratulations.

35
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,510
Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor,

36
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,450
you're a doctor, you're a doctor,

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,100
and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.

38
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,680
Congratulations, honey.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,600
Thank you.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,830
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,920
that when you two get married,

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,610
you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

43
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,080
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,610
And considering her advanced status,

45
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,780
that could open some doors for him.

46
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,540
Please, this isn't about me.

47
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,030
I'm proud of you.

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,760
Well, you'll be really be proud of this.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,660
I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company.

50
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,500
They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
What?

52
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,540
Bernadette, that's great.

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,640
Howard, do you make a buttload?

54
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,970
Better than what you've got a buttload of.

55
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,650
Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy.

56
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,070
If you do it, you're still not a doctor.

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,040
Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal.

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,300
It helps, but everything is not "peachy."

59
00:02:51,500 --> 00:03:02,090

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,610
*Oh, if there was a problem, you can't solve it

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,660
*Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,660
*Ice, Ice, baby

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,090
*Ice, Ice, baby

64
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,350
Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.

65
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,840
You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura.

66
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,360
Now prepare for... inspection.

67
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
Shh, my brother's going to hear you.

68
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,290
Relax, he's got headphones on.

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,380
And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,280
Really, ten miles?

71
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,620

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,620
You're orbiting inside the atmosphere?

73
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,740
Moron.

74
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,380
I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.

75
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,220
I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween.

76
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,640
Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,570
Okay, gotta go.

78
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,370
Hey, what's up?

79
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,740
Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?!

80
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,890
No, Ma! It's Raj!

81
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,430
- He's a doctor too, right?! - Yes!

82
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,340
Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,130
Sheldon, yes!

84
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,660
Everybody's a doctor but me!

85
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,240
Well, whose fault is that?!

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
What's up?

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,810
Leonard's putting disgusting memories in

88
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,240
my memory foam mattress.

89
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,180
Can I stay here tonight?

90
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,060
Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette.

91
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,020
It'll just be you and my mother.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,430
I guess that's okay.

93
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,060
Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

94
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,270
Of course, he and I can play doctor!

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,380
She's kidding, right?

96
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,030
I don't know, she's pretty feisty since

97
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,060
they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.

98
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,930
Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,890
I must say, Amy, I was very impressed

100
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,220
to see that Bernadette got her PhD.

101
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,670
It's indeed admirable.

102
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,190
Although, it is... microbiology.

103
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,370
Your doctorate is in neurobiology.

104
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,060
I fail to see the distinction.

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,630
I'll make it simple for you.

106
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,950
I study the brain,

107
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,510
the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

108
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,920
Bernadette studies yeast,

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,730
the organism responsible for Michelob Lite.

110
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,540
Is there something wrong with your neck?

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,510
It's a little stiff.

112
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,570
What a remarkably fragile structure

113
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,180
to support such a valuable payload.

114
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,660
Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.

115
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,150
Have you considered massage?

116
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,430
I'd like to respond to that sarcastically:

117
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,500
Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,540
with oil and rubbing it.

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,410
I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.

120
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,040
Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.

121
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,950
Trust me.

122
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,970
With your right hand,

123
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,650
locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.

124
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,210
All right.

125
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,890
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade,

126
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,510
making a small rotation as you do so.

127
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,920
Rotating.

128
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,310
You should feel a small node-like object

129
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,700
rolling back and forth along the bone.

130
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,330
You mean the myofascial point?

131
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,800
Obviously.

132
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,690
Now bear down on it

133
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,870
like the seventh grade noogies

134
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,580
we all know too well.

135
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,940
Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes!

136
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,210
Amy, I've never been touched like this before!

137
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,790
Oh! My hands are magic!

138
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,180
Don't flatter yourself.

139
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,530
Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge

140
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,210
of the nervous system.

141
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,800
I could just as easily have paralyzed you.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,340
There's someone at my door.

143
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,490
That doesn't interest me. Good-bye.

144
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,960
- Can I sleep here tonight? - Why?

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,690
Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate

146
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,010
Star Trek sex with my sister.

147
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,530
I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in.

148
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,480
Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

150
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,250
No, I can't authorize that.

151
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,310
Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,080
The Hammurabic Code is "an eye for an eye,"

153
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,670
not "a bed for a bed."

154
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,860
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,

155
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,680
and Tyra Banks says

156
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,840

157
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,350
the most important item in your makeup bag

158
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,840
is a good night's sleep.

159
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,320
All right.

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,080
This is a form indemnifying me

161
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,180
from your use of "Leonard's bedroom."

162
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,710
and did so using a stern facial expression.

164
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,640
- Good night, Sheldon.  - Wait. Not yet.

165
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,300
We still have to go over safety procedures.

166
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located

167
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,310
here, here, and here.

168
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,890
In the event of a power outage,

169
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,110
luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.

170
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,860
You're kidding.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,860
I never kid about safety.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,490
What are you doing here?

173
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,580
I was sleeping.

174
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,560
In my bed?

175
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,900
Well, I would've slept in my own bed,

176
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,580
but it was being used to bring shame to my family.

177
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,660
And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.

178
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,660

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,970
Oh, you heard?

180
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,920
"Scotty, I need more power."

181
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,190
Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?

182
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,130
Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver,

183
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,250
participate in an emergency fire drill

184
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,030
and take a refresher course in CPR.

185
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,490
Thank God he had a dummy.

186
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

187
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,860
You know, she used to date Howard?

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh, my God, she's that Mona?

189
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,630
Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?

190
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,770
We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.

191
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,220
Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon.

192
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,690
It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you

193
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,610
arm your photon torpedoes every night.

194
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,540
Okay, well, how about this:

195
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,210
until Priya gets her own place,

196
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,790
you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.

197
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,630
Can I bring girls here?

198
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,000
You?

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,260
Sure. Bring as many as you want.

200
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,980
Okay, deal.

201
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,690
Just not against their will.

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,640
You really think you should be eating that cake?

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,710
Why?

204
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,600
If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife,

205
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,650
you might want to watch your waistline.

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
He's right.

207
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,790
A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.

208
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
Yeah, ha-ha.

209
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,260
First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiance's success.

210
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm proud of her.

211
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,950
And secondly, I have my own career.

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,680
Until you have kids.

213
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,060
Good news, Raj.

214
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,220
I got the blood work back from the lab.

215
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,370
You're okay to stay for a while.

216
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,540
When did you take my blood?

217
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
Not important.

218
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,190
Your sugar was a little high.

219
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,580
I'd follow up with your regular physician.

220
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,790
In the meantime, I have some paperwork here

221
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,070
for you to go over.

222
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,920
What the hell is this?

223
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
Boilerplate stuff.

224
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,670
A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest.

225
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,100
And a living will and durable power of attorney.

226
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,640
This says you can make "end of life" decisions for me.

227
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,680
As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

228
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,340
Please sign.

229
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,520
Did you sign this?

230
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,950
There's a reciprocity clause.

231
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,060
You get to pull the plug on him, too.

232
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
Well, that seems fair.

233
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,330
Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard.

234
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,030
Here's your I.D. card,

235
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,750
your key and your lapel pin.

236
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,130
Which Leonard was too cool to wear.

237
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,670
FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem

238
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,640
will be to drive me to and from work,

239
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,920
the comic book store, the barbershop

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,990
and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.

241
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,880
Bring a ball or a Frisbee,

242
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,980
you know, something he can chase.

243
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,750
Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners.

244
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,020
Tonight is Thai food.

245
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,370
You'll find the standard order in appendix B

246
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,010
or downloadable from my FTP server.

247
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,420
If you have any questions,

248
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,090
here's the FAQ sheet,

249
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,020
or if you prefer the human touch,

250
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,120
I do a live web chat called "Apartment Talk" on Tuesday nights

251
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,970
No backsies.

252
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,680
Sheldon, dinner!

253
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,650
What is this?

254
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,500
This is the difference between eating and dining.

255
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,850
Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much

256
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,310
Leonard's been skating by all these years.

257
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,640
It's not a big thing.

258
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,420

259
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,420
Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.

260
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,810
Hey, Sheldon,

261
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,770
did you change your Wi-Fi password again?

262
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,190
Yes, it's "Penny, get your own Wi-Fi." No spaces.

263
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,240
Thanks.

264
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,440
What's with the fancy spread?

265
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
My new roommate is bending over backwards

266
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,700
to ingratiate himself to me.

267
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,980
Uh, nice touch, by the way.

268
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
What do you mean "new roommate"? What happened to Leonard?

269
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
The same thing that happened to Homo erectus.

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,170
He was replaced by a superior species.

271
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,810
I'm the new Homo in town.

272
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,010
That came out wrong.

273
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,050
All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?

274
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,380
He's living at my place, so I'm living here.

275
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,570
You're living here provisionally.

276
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,980
But I must say it's looking good.

277
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,900
Leonard and Priya are living together?

278
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,750
That's big.

279
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,220
No. Origami napkin swans...

280
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,850
that's the headline.

281
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,710
It's a good thing.

282
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,930
So do you know what kind of research you'll be doing

283
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,780
at this pharmaceutical company?

284
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,300
Well, there are a couple of opportunities available,

285
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,390
but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project.

286
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,600
I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease.

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,960
Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.

288
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.

289
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,770
I wanted to. Come on, open it.

290
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,340
You bought me a Rolex?

291
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,670
How much did this cost?

292
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,450
Oh, you let me worry about the money.

293
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,940
I just want my baby to have pretty things.

294
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,310
More wine?

295
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,400
Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.

296
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,820
Here's an interesting fact about alcohol...

297
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,570
Hit me.

298
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,250
Man is not the only species

299
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,420
that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated.

300
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,130
Can you guess what the other is?

301
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,640
Hint: sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.

302
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,630
Monkeys.

303
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,580
When does a monkey have a trunk?

304
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,380
When a suitcase just won't do.

305
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,730
Mmm, all right.

306
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,420
It would appear as if alcohol

307
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,440
is playing keep-away with your intelligence.

308
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,810
Good night.

309
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,110
Please note, it is now past 10:00 p.m.

310
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,360
Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain

311
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,650
from raucous laughter,

312
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,630
clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.

313
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,060
Okay...

314
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,020
explain something to me.

315
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,620
You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years.

316
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,400
What has to break inside your brain for you to think,

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
"Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that"?

318
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,540
Well, it's a lot better than having

319
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,060
to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.

320
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

321
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,630
Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.

322
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,760
- Every night. - Really?

323
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,770
Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate

324
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,800
between kissing and breathing?

325
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,340
It's my sister. Can we not talk about this anymore?

326
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,040
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

327
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,620
Can I tell you a secret?

328
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah.

329
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,270
I screwed up.

330
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,390
Leonard's a great guy.

331
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,700
Never should have broken up with him.

332
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,740
Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare:

333
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,740

334
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,910
"It's better to have loved and lost

335
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,150

336
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,070
"than to stay home every night

337
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,150
and download increasingly shameful pornography."

338
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,800
Ohh... you poor baby.

339
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,940
What's wrong with me, Penny?

340
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,330
Nothing, nothing.

341
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,850
You know, if we weren't friends,

342
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,240
and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story,

343
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,980
I'd be on you like

344
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,180
the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.

345
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,120
Hey, you totally got that right!

346
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,780
"E=mc2."

347
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,790
I listen.

348
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,260
I have no idea what it means, but I listen.

349
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,780
- To friendship. - To friendship.

350
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,980
Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking?!

351
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,980
And the answer was elephant!

352
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,010
Leonard, sweetheart,

353
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,590
we're kissing, not eating hot soup.

354
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,220
Sorry.

355
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,720
That's my parents on video chat.

356
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,770
Go hide in the bedroom.

357
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,640
Oh, come on!

358
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,820
Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?

359
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, we've been through this. It's not the time.

360
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,570
When is the time?

361
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,940
I've got five brothers and sisters.

362
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,610
One of them is bound to screw up real big,

363
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,460
and then I'll tell my parents about you.

364
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,080
- Now, shoo. - Fine.

365
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,960
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

366
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,570
We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City.

367
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,860
Is that close to you?

368
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,420
No.

369
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,930
Where is your brother?

370
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,240
Out with friends.

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,690
I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.

372
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,640
I'll sleep so much better

373
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,460
when you move back here next month.

374
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,730
You're moving back to India?!

375
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,440
Who's that?

376
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,540
Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment.

377
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,610
Call the police in America!

378
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,760
When were you going to tell me about this?

379
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,450
Oh, hello, Leonard.

380
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,200
What a pleasant surprise!

381
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,760
Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.

382
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,280
I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.

383
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,250
He has many friends.

384
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,420
Rajesh has many friends?

385
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,830
Why are you lying to us?

386
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,490
She's lying because she doesn't want you to know

387
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,830
- we're dating. - Leonard!

388
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,660
Well, what difference does it make?

389
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,200
If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.

390
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,250
You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.

391
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,560
So...

392
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,530
Hot in India?

393
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,020
Of course it is. It always is. It's India.

394
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,290
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?

395
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,240
That is a beautiful tapestry.

396
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,260
Oh, God.

397
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,050
Oh, God!

398
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,600
Okay, look.

399
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,840
This never happened.

400
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,510
Do you understand me?

401
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,460
Really?! Still can't talk to me?

402
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,070
What are you doing here?

403
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,710
What?

404
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,550
I said, what are you doing here?

405
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,600
I live here.

406
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,220
I have paperwork that says differently.

407
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,970
Priya's going back to India.

408
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,150
Irrelevant.

409
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,490
Rajesh and I have a good thing going

410
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,680
and you're not going to ruin it.

411
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,680
What are you doing here?

412
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,360
I've been up all night.

413
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,470
- I had a fight with Bernadette. - Why?

414
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,260
She gave me a beautiful watch.

415
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,780
Leonard, do you understand this?

416
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,230
Yes.

417
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,790
Talk to him.

418
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,560
Damn.

419
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,400
What's going on?

420
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,500
It's-it's not what it looks like.

421
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,360
What does it look like?
