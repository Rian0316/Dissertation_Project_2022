00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:34,383


115
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:30,523
當然可以

116
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,423

120
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:42,543
清清楚楚地寫著1216號
clearly gives the address as 1216.

121
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,463
1216  是的  先生
1216 -- that's correct, sir.

122
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:46,843
但在你們最初提交的文件中
But in the original submission,

123
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,923
寫的是羅塞拉路1261號
we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive.

124
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,263
-是1261  -1261
- It is 1261. ‭- 1261.

125
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,253
如果你們復查一遍  就會發現應該是1216
I think if you double-check, you'll see that 1216 is correct.

126
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,843
似乎是兩個不同的地址
There seem to be ‭two different addresses here.

127
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,483
專員先生  我這兒有一份意向通知書復印件
Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of our notice of intent,

00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,643
之前發表在亞利桑那和新墨西哥州的報紙上
which was published in newspapers in Arizona and New Mexico.

It clearly states the address is 1261 Rosella Drive.

Yes, I have a copy of the notice of intent, too,

133
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,453
但是正式提交的文件上
but on the actual filing,

134
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:20,113
地址寫的是1216號
the address reads 1-2-1-6.

135
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,063
所以...哪個才對
So...which is it?

136
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,543
專員先生  我能與委托人交換意見嗎
Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I may confer with my clients?

137
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:27,913

Certainly, please.

138

139
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,103
你搞錯了
You are mistaken,

140
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,563
恕我直言  你這是在添亂
and with all due respect, you're muddying the waters here.

141
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:37,443
"添亂"
"Muddying the water"?

142
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,093
看
‭Look.

143
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,493
自己看
Just look.

144
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,333
這很明顯是個錯誤
Well, ‭this is clearly an error.

145
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:45,723
是1261沒錯
It's 1261.

146
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,513
我當然知道自己的銀行在哪
I know where my own damn bank is.

147
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:48,913
我們都冷靜一下
Uh, let's just all calm down.

148
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:49,753
肯定可以理清楚的
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

149
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,803
我在羅塞拉路1261號改造了一棟樓
I've got a building remodel at 1261 Rosella.

150
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,683
我倒不知道1216號是哪里
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.

151
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:59,013
我不太明白...  1261
I-I don't quite underst-- 1261.

152
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,033
-是1261  -這有什么問題嗎
- 1261. - ‭Is this gonna be a problem?

153
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,973
不會  肯定沒問題
No, I'm sure it won't be.

154
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:06,733
專員先生  抱歉
Um, M-Mr. Commissioner, I apologize.

155
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,513
不知為何  我們的文件里
Unaccountably, there appears to be a...

156
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,883
似乎出現了矛盾
discrepancy in our filing.

157
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,443
所以正確的地址
So the correct address the one

158
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:16,283
是意向通知書上的1261號嗎
that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261?

159
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,563
看似如此
It would seem so.

160
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,343
我們想請求...
Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um,

161
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,683
休會幾分鐘
an adjournment of just a few minutes

162
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:26,853
好讓我們將文件修改為正確的地址
so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address.

163
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:31,303
我可以允許休會
Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh,

164
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:33,653
但是...
but, uh...uh,

165
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,733
今天可能沒辦法重新聽證了
I don't think we can get you back in today.

166
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:40,333
請問什么時候可以重新安排聽證
If I may, when do you think you might be able to schedule us?

167
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:41,663
工作人員告知
I'm being told by staff

168
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:46,213
他們已經對羅塞拉路1216號進行了調查
that they've already done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive.

169

凱文還是擔心一個律師不能勝任

Kim, I was hoping to have this conversation with you

299

對你一個人說
and you alone.

300
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:31,565

昨天早上是我職業生涯中最大的羞辱
Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life.

he went through my Mesa Verde files.

319
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,945
我們不用聽你在這胡言亂語
Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.

320
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,235
她得聽
She does!

321
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,235
好好聽  為你自己好
You do -- for your own good.

322
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,945
這里面有十三份文件
Now, in these files are 13 documents

323
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:46,425
標有梅薩維德銀行擬設支行的地址
containing the address of Mesa Verde's proposed branch --

324
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,305
羅塞拉路1261號  亞利桑那州斯科茨代爾
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, arizona.

325
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:52,755
吉米抽出每一份文件
Jimmy pulled each and every one,

326
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:56,065
留下我在這里大汗淋漓神志不清
then he left me here, sweating and delirious,

327
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:57,815
然后跑出去篡改了它們
while he went off to doctor them.

328
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,825
你需要復印機啊
You'd need a photocopier for that.

329
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,695
你去哪了  某個通宵營業的復印店嗎
Where'd you go -- some all-night copy shop?

330
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,755
經過小心剪切和粘貼后
With a little careful cutting and pasting,

331
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,105
他做好了復制品
he created duplicates --

332
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:09,845
跟原件幾乎一模一樣
virtually identical to my originals,

333
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,895
只有一處關鍵差別
but with one key change --

334
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:16,435
羅塞拉路1261號成了羅塞拉路1216號
1261 Rosella Drive ‭became 1216 Rosella Drive.

335
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,495
這聽起來可是大工程
This is sounding like a lot of work.

336
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,565
沒人說你懶
No one ever accused you of being lazy --

337
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,035
你有各種缺點  唯獨不懶
every other sin in the book, but not that one.

338
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:24,005
如果你想知道
And if you're wondering

339
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,105
吉米有沒有能力偽造文書
if Jimmy's up to a little casual forgery,

340
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,845
那我告訴你
you should know in high school,

341
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,315
他高中時就曾靠偽造身份證件日進斗金
he had a thriving business making fake I.Ds

342
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,755
讓他的兄弟們都有啤酒喝
so his buddies could buy beer.

343
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,525
高中的事你也提嗎
You going all the way back to high school, huh?

344
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,195
你跟莫扎特一樣
Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

345
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,695
都是從小就有天分
You both started young.

346
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:42,665
他回來之后  便把復制品夾在我的文件里
He came back here and put his new versions in my files.

347
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,075
然后  第二天
And then, the next day,

348
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:48,175
我那體貼的弟弟就離開了
my caring brother took his leave.

349
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:51,445
他知道我會用他篡改過的文件
He knew that I would use his modified documents

350
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:54,385
撰寫梅薩維德銀行的申請報告
to write Mesa Verde's submission to the state regulator.

351
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,355
也確實如此  我一遍遍地
And so I did, over and over --

352
00:21:57,355 --> 00:22:00,825
輸入著1216  而不是1261
I typed "1216" instead of "1261."

353
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,425
我當時還想  "羅塞拉路1216
I remember thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive --

354
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:07,805
"是1215年的下一年
"that's just one year after 1215,

355
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:09,955
"是《大憲章》簽署的第二年"
"the year the Magna Carta was signed."

356
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,435
天哪  查克  你瘋了吧
Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.

357
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,275
所以你的意思是  里面這些文件
So, you're saying, if we look in here,

358
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,025
上面的地址都是錯誤的
all the addresses will be wrong?

359
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:19,675
你當然不會留下證據
Well, of course you weren't gonna leave evidence behind.

360
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:24,665
我猜昨天早上  你等到我走了之后
I'm guessing yesterday morning, you waited until I left,

361
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:27,075
用你的鑰匙進了門
then used your key to let yourself in

362
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,585
把原始文件還了回來
and return the originals.

363
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,325
沒有掩蓋的犯罪是不完整的
No crime is complete without the cover-up.

364
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,175
天哪拜托
Oh, come on.

365
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:35,205
我為什么要這么做  為了什么生意嗎
I did all this -- what -- for some business?

366
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:40,485
他都是為了你
He did it for you.

367
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,515
你對此肯定一點都不知情
Oh, I'm sure you didn't know anything about it.

368
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:49,975
這肯定是他自己的主意
I believe he went off on his own

369
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,675
把這當成某種扭曲的浪漫之舉
and did this as some kind of twisted romantic gesture.

370
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,045
查克  你應該躺下來
Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down

371
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,945
用冷毛巾敷敷額頭了
with a cold washcloth on your head.

372
00:22:56,955 --> 00:23:00,025
現在你知道了  你別無選擇了
And now that you know, you have no choice.

373
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:04,875
這事關委托人  一個被欺騙的委托人
This is about a client -- a client who has been defrauded.

374
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,045
作為一名宣過誓的律師
As a sworn officer of the court,

375
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,115
作為梅薩維德銀行的正式代理律師
as Mesa Verde's attorney of record,

376
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:12,025
你只能去找凱文·沃弛泰爾
you have no recourse but to go to Kevin Wachtell

377
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,365
把這一切和盤托出
and make a full disclosure.

378
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,905
他這一整套說辭
This -- This whole song and dance --

379
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,845
只是為了奪回他的委托人
it's all about getting his client back.

380
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,335
-就是為了這個目的  -完全不是
- That's all this is. - ‭Not in the least.

381
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,015
如果他們得知真相后仍然決定...
If, knowing the truth, they still decide to go --

382
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,365
你不能忍受他們選擇了她而不是你
You can't stand the fact that they chose her over you.

383
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:25,465
我不能忍受的是
I can't stand the fact

384
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,735
我的親弟弟在我背后捅刀子
that my own brother stabbed me in the back!

385
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,245
我不能忍受你欺騙了這位年輕的女士
I can't stand the fact that you've deceived

386
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,125
-讓她墮落至此  -"墮落"
- and ruined this fine young woman! - ‭"Ruined"?

387
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,785
現在是十九世紀四十年代嗎
What is this -- the 1840s?

388
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,875
你說什么呢  她才沒有墮落
What are you talking about? She's not ruined!

389
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,785
吉米
Jimmy.

390
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:44,765
如果你說的都是真的
If what you're saying is true,

391
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:49,905
吉米會被指控偽造文書  詐騙
Jimmy could be charged with forgery, fraud,

392
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:52,945
偽造證據  甚至非法侵入
falsifying evidence, even breaking and entering.

393
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,935
坦白說  我也很難受
Frankly, I am sick about this.

394
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:57,005
但事實就是事實
But facts are facts.

395
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,125
你有證據嗎
And what is your evidence?

396
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:03,565
證據
My evidence?

397
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,185
證據就是我十分了解我的弟弟
My evidence is knowing my brother for his entire life.

398
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:10,465
查克  還有別的解釋
Chuck, I think ‭there is another explanation --

399
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:11,675
一個更簡單的解釋
it's a simpler one.

400
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,805
你看錯了
You made a mistake.

401
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,075
我沒有
I did not.

402
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,705
你在油燈下工作
You're wororking by lantern,

403
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:20,275
瞇著眼盯著那些打印出來的十磅小字
squinting over 10-point type for hour after hour.

404
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:23,395
錯把1261當成了1216
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216

405
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,775
這是極其正常的事情
would be the most natural thing in the world.

406
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:25,845
我也可能犯這樣的錯
It could certainly happen to me.

407
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,925
我沒有搞錯
I did not make a mistake!

408
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:30,425
就是你搞錯了
I believe you did.

409
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,755
我知道  你很喜歡吉米
Look, I understand that you have a -- a great affection for Jimmy.

410
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:37,015
很多人都喜歡  但請你睜開眼睛
A great many people do, but please open your eyes here!

411
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:40,245
你犯了一個錯誤  你非但不去面對它
You made a mistake, and instead of just facing up to it,

412
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,815
反而指責你的弟弟陷害你
you accuse your brother of plotting against you.

413
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,885
編造出這么精心策劃的陰謀
You come up ‭with this elaborate scheme.

414
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,005
他做得出來
He's capable of this!

415
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:46,765
我知道他能
You know he is!

416
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,085
我知道他有很多缺點
I know he's not perfect!

417
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,435
我知道他喜歡走捷徑
And I know he cuts corners.

418
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,445
但是你讓他變成這樣的
But you're the one who made him this way.

419
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:58,425
他崇拜你
He idolizes you.

420
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:00,325
他接受你
He accepts you.

421
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,795
他照顧你
He takes care of you.

422
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,855
他只想要你的愛與支持
And all he ever wanted was your love and support,

423
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,345
但你只會對他指手畫腳
but all you've ever done is judge him.

424
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,745
你從來不相信他
You never believed in him.

425
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:14,595
你從來不希望他成功
You never wanted him to succeed.

426
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:19,745
你知道嗎
And you know what?

427
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,305
我為他感到難過
I feel sorry for him.

428
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,065
也為你感到難過
And I feel sorry for you.

429
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,015
天啊  干什么
Jesus! What? ‭

430
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,965
金  干什么
Kim! What?

431
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:17,965
給我  開車
Just drive.

432
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,936
好了  根據班級排好隊
All right, line up by class!

433
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:46,866
去找你們的小伙伴
Find your buddy!

434
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,166
孩子們  過來
Okay, kids, come on.

435
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:02,966
我們上
Let's go.

436
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,496
來  來
Come on. Come on.

437
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,326
-趕緊各就各位  -這邊嗎
- Plant yourself. ‭- All right. Here?

438
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:25,776
沒錯  這邊
Yeah. Right there.

439
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,296
這么高就行了
About yea high. ‭

440
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:29,606
對準我  拍出英雄氣概
Aim it up at me -- heroic.

441
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,926
英雄氣概  祝你好運了
Heroic? Good luck with that.

442
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:32,596
趕緊給我拍
Just frame me up, all right?

443
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:33,956
把脖子也給化好
Make sure you get the neck, okay?

444
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,316
-這是從下方拍攝的  -好的
- It's a low-angle shoot. ‭- Okay.

445
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:36,626
算了  讓我看看
Hey, you know what? Let me see.

446
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:37,996
這只是打個底
Oh, I-it's just base.

447
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,736
我這是得肺癆要死了嗎
What -- am I dying of consumption?

448
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,286
你這個年齡段的人沒那么紅潤
Well, at your age, ‭you don't want to look too red.

449
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,326
-應該有點紅斑痤瘡  -那這些...
- It looks like rosacea. - And what's with all the...

450
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:46,216
我只是想化出你下巴的輪廓
I'm just trying to make it look like you have a jawline.

451
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,726
我下巴本來就有輪廓
I do have a jawline.

452
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,726
這樣吧  你站過去
You know what? You stand in for me.

453
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:52,976
蹲一點
Hey, crouch down.

454
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:55,106
往左  另一邊
Okay. Move to your left. The other left.

455
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,186
再左一點  好了
More. More. Okay, boom!

456
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,146
我就是這個意思  懂了吧
That's what I'm talkinin about. You got it.

457
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:01,006
肯定還有更簡單的拍攝方式
Oh, dude, there's got to be an easier way to get this shot.

458
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:02,036
免費的可沒有
Not for free.

459
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:04,176
你要想拍電影  就得膽子大
You wanna be a filmmaker, grow a pair.

460
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,116
好了  準備正式拍攝
Here we go. Picture's up.

461
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:07,556
好  我們開始吧
All right, let's do this.

462
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:08,766
最后補一下
Last looks.

463
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,676
大黃  大黃  九點鐘方向
Rhubarb, Rhubarb. 9:00.

464
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:18,166
不好意思
Excuse me.

465
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,626
你是這里的負責人嗎
Hi. Are you in charge here?

466
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,756
是的  這是學校用地
Yes, I am, ‭and this is school property.

467
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:23,496
我正要找你呢
You're just the person I want to speak to.

468
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,796
如果你能讓那幢樓里的孩子小聲點
It would be incredibly helpful if you could get those kids in that building

469
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:28,776
會對我們很有幫助的
over there to just keep it down for a bit.

470
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,526
讓他們做點練習之類的
Just give 'em a worksheet or something?

471
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,326
只要兩三分鐘  很快的
I mean, just two or three minutes, just for sound.

472
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:33,786
這里是學校用地
This is school property,

473
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:35,556
未經允許任何人都不得入內
and no one is allowed here without permission.

474
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:36,596
當然了
Of course not.

475
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,686
-安奈特沒和你說嗎  -安奈特是誰
- You didn't speak to Annette? - ‭Annette?

476
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:43,886
主管辦公室的
In the Superintendent's office.

477
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,036
你認識城里叫安奈特的嗎
Do you know an Annette downtown?

478
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:46,146
不認識
I don't think so.

479
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,026
抱歉添麻煩了
Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

480
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,996
我們在拍"定場鏡頭"...
We're shooting what's called an establishing shot --

481
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:53,846
最多五分鐘
five minutes, tops.

482
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:55,046
我弄清楚之前
You're not shooting anything

483
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,846
你們什么都不準拍
until I'm clear on what's going on here.

484
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,076
紀錄片  我們在拍紀錄片
The documentary -- we're making a documentary.

485
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:01,126
是...
That's -- Oh!

486
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,816
我聽說有個展覽或者紀念牌匾之類的
I was told there was a display or a plaque of some kind.

487
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,016
你知道在哪里嗎
Would you know where that would be?

488
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:06,516
我們為什么會有牌匾
Why would we have a plaque?

489
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,876
因為曾在這里上過學的人
Because of who went to school here.

490
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,336
誰曾在這里上過學
Who went to school here?

491
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:11,946
魯伯特·霍姆斯
Rupert Holmes.

492
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:13,876
就是關于他的紀錄片
That's who the documentary is about.

493
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,226
抱歉  誰
I'm sorry. Who?

494
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:16,406
魯伯特·霍姆斯
Rupert Holmes.

495
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,276
魯伯特·霍姆斯  創作歌手
You know...Rupert Holmes, the singer/songwriter.

496
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:23,126
"椰林飄香之歌"
You know, um... "The Piña Colada Song."

497
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:23,126
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}一種雞尾酒

498
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,406
你肯定知道  我...
I mean, sure you do. I...

499
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:35,316
*如果你喜歡椰林飄香  被大雨困住*
*If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain*

500
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:40,196
*如果你不喜歡瑜伽  還算有點腦子*
*If you're not into yoga and you got half a brain*

501
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:42,866
*如果你喜歡半夜啪啪啪*
*If you like makin' love at midnight*

502
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,596
*在海角旁的沙丘*
*In the dunes by the cape...*

503
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,416
知道嗎  魯...  看看她的臉
See? Ru-- Look at her face.

504
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,226
-魯伯特·霍姆斯  -他在這上過學嗎
- Rupert Holmes. - ‭He went to school here?

505
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:50,306
是啊  64屆的
Yeah. Class of '64.

506
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,456
他現在還經常說
He still talks about it.

507
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,216
但這所學校是71年建的
But the school was built in '71.

508
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:56,216
他在那之前的老樓里上過學
Mm. He was a student in the old building that used to be here.

509
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,746
我們有點...怎么說呢
We're taking a little -- what do you call it?

510
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,246
藝術再創作
Artistic liberties.

511
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:02,386
魯伯特·霍姆斯不是英國人嗎
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?

512
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:08,116
是啊  這可以拿來做小趣事
Well, yeah, ‭and that's some great trivia,

513
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:11,546
但他青少年時期是在阿爾布開克度過的
but he spent his formative years right here in Albuquerque.

514
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,036
這樣吧  你打到主管辦公室
I'll tell you what -- why don't you call Annette

515
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:16,556
找安奈特
down in ‭the Superintendent's Office?

516
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:19,136
我們就在這等官方回話
And we'll just stay here till you get official word.

517
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,606
-好  如果你不介意等的話  -不會
- Well, ‭if you don't mind waiting. - Not at all.

518
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:21,996
我們不想違反任何規定
We don't want to break any rules.

519
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,556
不會太久的
Shouldn't take very long, I'm sure.

520
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:24,856
雖然不能保證
And no promises,

521
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,876
但我盡量讓孩子們安靜點
but I'll see what I can do about getting the kids to quiet down.

522
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,626
那真是幫了大忙了
Oh. ‭That would be super helpful.

523
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,946
快點  這時候正好
Chop-chop. Magic time.

524
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,436
-快點  -好的
- Come on, let's go. - All right

525
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:46,946
不做造型了  把旗子降下來
No last looks. ‭Just the flag -- the flag.

526
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,956
好  記著  英雄氣概
Okay, remember -- heroic.

527
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:50,116
好  你是個英雄
Yeah, you're a hero.

528
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,556
-大英雄  -要莊重
- Big, big hero. - ‭Gravitas.

529
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:00,996
開始
Go.

530
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:04,776
推  推  推
Dolly, dolly, dolly.

531
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,276
漂亮
Nice.

532
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,036
漂亮
Nice.

533
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,156
-你好  麥克  -你好  弗蘭
- Hey, Mike. ‭- Hey, Fran.

534
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:29,506

You still serving breakfast?

535
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:32,026
你來就供應  老樣子嗎
For you? Sure. The usual?

536
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:33,566
好的
Um, be great.

537

謝謝
Thanks.

538
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,406
有什么好事嗎
Anything good in the paper?

539
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,046
沒有
No.

540
00:31:51,046 --> 00:31:53,276
報紙上有過好事嗎
Was there ever anything good in the paper?

541
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,396
確實不多
Not too often.

542
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:59,046
-弗蘭  -怎么
- Hey, Fran. - ‭Yeah?

543
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:00,826
我問一下
I got to ask...

544
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,846
這里下過雪嗎
does it ever snow around here?

545
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:06,926
下過
Sure, it does.

546
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:09,646
你要在阿爾布開克度過第一個冬天嗎
This is gonna be your first winter in Albuquerque?

547
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,866
沒錯  我從費城來
Yeah. I'm out from Philadelphia.

548
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,506
看哪一年吧
Well, it depends on the year.

549
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,756
如果你待得夠久
If you stay around long enough,

550
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:18,826
就會有雪鏟的  不用擔心
you'll have something to shovel -- don't you worry.

551
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,136
我喜歡鏟雪
That suits me.

552
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:23,316
我住在錫達克雷斯特  經常下雪
I live up in Cedar Crest. We get plenty.

553
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:26,056
如果嫌不夠可以來鏟我家車道的雪
You can shovel my drive if you're looking for more.

554
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,896
一句話的事
Just say the word.

555
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,466
好吧
Yeah, well...

556
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:32,126
小姐  結賬
Miss. check, please?

557
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:01,076
喂
Yeah.

558
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,376
我們得談談
We gotta talk.

559
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,556
我得知道些事
I've got something I need to know,

560
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:18,866
立刻告訴我
and I need to know it fast.

561
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:21,816
什么事
What's that?

562
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,826
我們不久前被搶了
We got hit the other day.

563
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:26,706
一輛向南開的卡車被劫了
A truck headed south got hijacked.

564
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,756
有人偷了二十五萬
Someone stole a quarter million.

565
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:32,166
現在赫克托氣瘋了  在找是誰干的
Now Hector's flippin' out, lookin' for who did it.

566
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:33,646
問題是
Thing is...

567
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:36,796
我覺得是你
I think it was you.

568
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:42,106
司機被綁起來了  身上卻沒有傷痕
They left the driver hog-tied -- not a mark on him.

569
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:45,226
干這一行的都殺人不眨眼
Anyone in the game would capped him without a second thought.

570
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:47,546
但這個司機還活著
But this driver? He's still breathin'.

571
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:49,176
我就琢磨  這家伙是誰
I thought to myself, "who's the guy

572
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:50,676
搶了幾十萬毒資
who'll rip off a couple hundred thousand

573
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:53,676
還留一個目擊者
in drug money and leave a witness?

574
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:58,136
什么人不愿開槍
Who's the guy ‭who won't pull the trigger?"

575
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:01,256
就是你
You.

576
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:14,896
我不是來勒索你的
I'm not here to squeeze you.

577
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,246
你想搶販毒集團  那是你的事
You wanna rip off the cartel, that's your business.

578
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:18,346
但問題是
But here's the thing.

579
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,236
我要去接那個司機  赫克托的命令
I'm picking up that driver -- Hector's orders.

580
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:23,906
我們要看看他知道什么
We're gonna see what he knows,

581
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,936
如果他認識你  那對我倆都不好
and if he knows you, that's bad for both of us.

582
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:29,506
你不用擔心
That shouldn't concern you.

583
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:31,256
但他跟你是一伙的  對吧
But he was in on it, right?

584
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:32,726
那司機和此事無關
The driver ‭had nothing to do with it.

585
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,486
-那是誰  -只有我
- Then who? - ‭Just me.

586
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:37,466
你是說你干這票  里頭沒人嗎
You're telling me you did this without someone on the inside?

587
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:39,296
不可能
Not possible.

588
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:41,886
你怎么知道那輛卡車的
How did you know about the truck?

589
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:44,066
你怎么知道在輪胎里
How do you know about the tires?

590
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:45,106
要我說
All I can tell you is,

591
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,786
你們高估了自己的智商
you guys aren't half as smart as you think you are.

592
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:52,616
所以那個司機什么都不知道嗎
So the driver... doesn't know anything?

593
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,826
-什么都不知道  -他聽到你聲音了嗎
- Not a thing. - ‭He hear your voice?

594
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,696
-沒有  -現在赫克托還在查競爭對手
- No. - ‭Right now, Hector's looking at the competition,

595
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,726
但他要是聽司機說是個年紀大的美國佬...
but he hears the driver say it was some old gringo...

596
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,876
他沒聽到我說話
He didn't hear me.

597
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:02,676
他就看到一個戴滑雪面具的人而已
He saw a guy with a ski mask -- that's it.

598
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,036
你肯定
And you're sure of that?

599
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:05,646
沒錯
Yeah.

600
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:09,376
你最好別搞錯
You better be right.

601
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,776
為什么沒上報紙
Why wasn't it in the papers?

602
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:13,366
什么
What?

603
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:18,026
卡車劫案  警察沒讓上報紙嗎
The truck robbery -- the cops keeping it out of the papers?

604
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:19,476
警察
The cops?

605
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,456
警察什么都不知道
The cops don't know shit about it.

606
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,486
怎么會呢
How's that?

607
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,606
這就是你的目的嗎
Is that what this is about?

608
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,476
你想讓警察去抓赫克托
You wanted to put the cops onto Hector?

609
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,556
為什么
Why?

610
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,076
你對他不重要
You are nothing to him.

611
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,776
他完全忘了你
He forgot all about you.

612
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,186
我可沒忘記他
I haven't forgotten him.

613
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,946
你把我推進火坑
You put me in the shit,

614
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:44,416
就因為你想整赫克托·塞拉曼加
just 'cause you got it in for Hector Salamanca?

615
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:49,436
你把警察引向了他  也就引向了我
Listen, you put the cops on him, you put them on me.

616
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:53,376
你要是為了錢  我懂  但你這樣
Doing it for the money -- I get it, but this shit --

617

你得冷靜
You need to calm yourself down,

619
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:01,406
把手從那個口袋拿出來
and you need to take that hand out of that pocket.

620
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,116
你要明白
Now, just so you know...

621
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,636
都結束了
it's over.

622
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:23,386
我跟你老板的事結束了
I'm done with your boss.

623
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:26,446
算了
Whatever.

624
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,996
為什么沒上報紙
Why wasn't it in the papers?

625
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,766
因為我們收拾干凈了
Because we cleaned it up.

626
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,396
怎么收拾的
How's that?

627

我們很幸運
We got lucky.

628
00:36:38,856 --> 00:36:40,776
你離開后  有個好心人過來
After you left, ‭a Good Samaritan came along

629
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:43,386
大叫"天啊  天啊"
and said, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"

630
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:46,286
他給司機松綁  司機叫我們過去
He cut the driver loose. The driver called us.

631
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,946
我們過去開走了卡車
We came out, got the truck.

632
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,946
就好像沒發生過一樣
Made it like it never happened.

633
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,196
那好心人呢
And that Good Samaritan?

634
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,686
赫克托崩了他的臉
Hector shot him in the face.

635
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:04,706
我們把他埋在了沙漠里
We buried the guy out in the desert.

636
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:06,316
我說了...
Like I said...

637
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:08,996

拍完了廣告
Finished the commercial.

644
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,906
我不是賣弄  但這可能是

電視史上最棒的六十秒

somewhere between 11:18 and 11:35,

648
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:28,126

stop what you're doing and tune in to "Diagnosis Murder."

649
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:30,356

你想談談這事嗎
You want to talk about this?

我只想說...

你和梅薩維德絕對應該合作
you are meant for Mesa Verde, and they are meant for you.

655
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,796

你說得沒錯
You'd better believe it.

662
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,396
他是那種
The kind of adversary

和他對抗  你真得確保
