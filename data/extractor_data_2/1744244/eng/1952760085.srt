I wasn't even thinking
about getting married

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,486
until he brought it up.
Now I'm, like, obsessed.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,421
Phillips.

20
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,156
Wasn't he drunk
when he proposed?

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,659
Oh, yeah. It was like that
David Hasselhoff video,

22
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:27,560
eating a cheeseburger.

23
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:28,995
I never saw that.

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,664
Oh, you gotta YouTube it.

25
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:33,500
It's like a car wreck...
you can't not watch.

26
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:34,601
You really want a drunk proposal

27
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:35,835
to be the story you tell
your grandkids?

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,938
My husband proposed to me

29
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,273
at the top of the Sears Tower.

30
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,374
Champagne and roses.

31
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,343
Six months into the marriage,

32
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,011
I found out he was
fucking my sister.

33
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:47,714
And the moral of the story is?

34
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:50,483
My sister's a bitch.

35
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,218
Other than the presents
and the booze,

36
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:54,187
give me three good reasons
why you want to get married.

37
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,622
Lots of people who
love each other

38
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,257
get married every day, Fiona.

39
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,460
I don't know, V.

40
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:02,529
The way things are between
you and Kevin right now,

41
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,397
it seems perfect.

42
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,433
Why ruin it?

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,381
What do you get for that?

44
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,749
What?

45
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:23,883
What are they paying

46
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:26,753
for the neck thing, disability?

47
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:29,823
674 bucks a month.

48
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,595
That's what I get.

49
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,230
But look, I can do this.

50
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,581
While I admire your commitment,
I gotta tell ya,

51
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,950
it's a bit over the top.

52
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,991
I told 'em I get migraines.

53
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,727
Genius, huh?
Huh?

54
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:10,463
Try proving I don't have 'em.

55
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,969
I bet it itches like
you got crabs in there.

56
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:31,151
Kev, come out.

57
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,288
You done?

58
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:36,389
Why are we getting married?

59
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,223
What?

60
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,324
Other than the presents

61
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,126
and the booze, can you tell me

62
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,562
three good reasons why you
want to get married?

63
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,997
Not really.

64
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,833
Wait a minute... this isn't
one of those tests, is it?

65
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,101
One of those woman things

66
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,602
where I'm supposed
to change your mind?

67
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:50,937
If it is, you just failed.

68
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,640
You saying you don't want
to get married?

69
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,608
No, I mean, things between
us are pretty great.

70
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:57,110
I don't want to ruin it.

71
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,478
What would we tell people?

72
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,180
That the wedding's off.

73
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,514
No one's damn business why.

74
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:02,515
Yeah?

75
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,616
Yeah.

76
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,986
Well, great then.

77
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,925
Guess I gotta tell Mama.

78
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,293
Oh, yeah.

79
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,794
That's gonna suck.

80
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,897
She's on her way over to talk
about the blessed event.

81
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:21,901
I am gonna miss getting
a free KitchenAid mixer.

82
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,336
Can we still
register for gifts,

83
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,671
even though you're
not getting married?

84
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:25,939
I got a gift for ya.

85
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,807
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,616
♪ Here comes the bride,
all dressed in white! ♪

87
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,586
Which I think you can
still get away with, baby.

88
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,522
Hey, Mama.

89
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:47,694
Oh, I can't believe it!
Oh, I can't believe it!

90
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:49,129
I can't believe this!

91
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,363
What happened?

92
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:51,998
Nothing happened, Mama.
We just deci...

93
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,833
How could you do this to me?
Look, Mama,

94
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,835
nothing's gonna change.
Kev and I are still together.

95
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,705
Yeah, Mama...
Don't call me Mama.

96
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,474
We're just cutting out
all the paperwork, right?

97
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,045
You know, and besides, until
gay people can get married

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,482
in this state, I'm not gonna.

99
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,751
You know this isn't what
your father wants.

100
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,219
You know that, don't you?

101
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,054
Daddy's dead, Mama.
He doesn't really want anything.

102
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:18,858
Your daddy, rest his soul, wants
to see his little girl married.

103
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,727
Look, Mama...

104
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,530
That's why he set aside a little
something for you for once you

105
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,632
finally settled down.
A little what?

106
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,234
Your daddy left you money
for your first home

107
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,336
once you got married.
A house?

108
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,305
Yeah, he thought
it might keep you

109
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,240
from being somebody's baby mama.
How much?

110
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,576
I don't know! He wanted
the envelope opened

111
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,510
on your wedding day.

112
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,747
Now I guess we'll never know.

113
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,684
I just... I never knew
how much it meant to Daddy.

114
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,919
The world.

115
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:49,322
Maybe we should
reconsider, babe.

116
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:51,491
But what about the gay people?

117
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,027
They got their parades.
They can wait.

118
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,897
It's hot. I'm hot.

119
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,299
Are you guys hot?

120
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,137
Hot!

121
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,641
Coming!

122
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:23,122
Hey.
Pee.

123
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:24,857
Oh, it's fresh?

124
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,192
Clean as a whistle.

125
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:29,028
Thanks, Fiona... you have
no idea what this means to me.

126
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,697
Means you get to smoke weed

127
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,166
and keep your government
job, and I get to eat.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,734
It's lasagna,
straight from the oven.

129
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,102
It's still warm.
So's this.

130
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,738
Keep it that way,
if you want to pass.

131
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:39,872
Lunch!

132
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:41,541
Eat it or miss it, people!

133
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,576
Thanks. Bye.

134
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,178
What, more piss food?

135
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:49,415
You know it.
All right!

136
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,884
Cup-a-lasagna, anyone?
Right here.

137
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,653
Who was on dishes today?

138
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,888
Uh, I'll get them after lunch.

139
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,825
Hey, Debs, you
ready to go to Target?

140
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,892
Yeah, sure.

141
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:01,227
What's that smell?

142
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,396
It's either vomit
or fancy cheese.

143
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,398
It can be both if you want.

144
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,934
Target?

145
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:11,237
Deb's gonna go help me register
for wedding gifts.

146
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,905
I thought the wedding was off?

147
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,607
Back on.

148
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,109
Kev know?
Uh-huh.

149
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,378
Oh!

150
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,545
Hey-hey!

151
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,048
Mmm... damn.
You tell that girl Sonny I will

152
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,650
crap on a paper plate for her

153
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,418
if it'll get me
some of this grub.

154
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,767
Francis Gallagher. Yeah.

155
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:51,110
Drop your pants.

156
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:54,647
I don't see how that has
any bearings on my migraines.

157
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,183
Me neither, but it's on
the State form.

158
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,718
Drop 'em, sailor.

159
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,955
Yeah.

160
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,091
Still cold.

161
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,592
Cough.

162
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,328
Again.

163
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,396
Again.

164
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,433
That's weird.

165
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:17,337
Have you ever done
a testicular self-examination?

166
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,705
Oh, God, no.

167
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,274
I say leave those three
bad boys down there alone.

168
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:22,575
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

169
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:26,245
Should only be two testicles
invited to this party.

170
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,513
What's this?

171
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,681
I need you and your testicles

172
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,683
back here tomorrow
for a biopsy.

173
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,618
So, I got an extra passenger
on board.

174
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:33,853
What's the big deal?

175
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,088
Normal number's two.

176
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,924
Not for me.
Third guy's always been there.

177
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,526
He's my lucky charm.
Gave me six kids.

178
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,829
Mmm. Probably benign then.

179
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:46,099
You're smart not to worry
till you do a biopsy.

180
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,368
Gives you something
to worry about.

181
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,136
Yeah.

182
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,046
Uh, pretty sure you can't bring
a baby into a bar, ma'am.

183
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,882
And I'm pretty sure you can't
get married if you already are.

184
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,983
Yeah, I know, I know.

185
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,385
Why the hell
doesn't she know yet?

186
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,754
'Cause... I'm afraid to tell her.
Kev...

187
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,922
I don't want to
make her sad, Fi.

188
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,791
It would break my heart
to hurt her.

189
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,827
Just tell her the truth, Kev.

190
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,796
If you don't, I will.

191
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,401
Can you hit me
with a milk refill?

192
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:25,204
The devil's in my balls, Billy,

193
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,839
and he's comin'
for the rest of me.

194
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,308
Let's hope he can swim.

195
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,843
Why, Billy? Why me?

196
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:32,545
Because you're
an asshole, Frank.

197
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,481
Doc says it's probably benign.

198
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:38,584
Look at Lance Armstrong.
He had that ball cancer.

199
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,953
Yeah, he ends up fucking
a rock star.

200
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,755
That's right!
That's right! See?

201
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,890
Hey, baby!

202
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,192
Hey-hey!

203
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,127
How you doing?

204
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,062
Okay, I know that
this is silly,

205
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,798
but I'm really starting
to get excited

206
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:52,832
about this whole wedding thing.

207
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,468
The gifts and the wedding

208
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:56,903
and being Mrs. Kevin Ball.

209
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:00,673
You know old man
Parson's place on Fifth?

210
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:02,608
I think we should buy it.

211
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,876
What?

212
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:05,745
You know, the one where
the son went crazy

213
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,113
and hit him with an axe?

214
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:09,081
It's for sale and
I think we should start,

215
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,283
like, getting
our stuff together...

216
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,885
all the loans and
credit scores and all that.

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,287
What's the matter, babe?

218
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:18,191
I'm sure they got
the blood cleaned up by now.

219
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:24,464
I can't marry you, Veronica.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,001
I'm already married.

221
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,539
She's beautiful.

222
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,476
She's a head case.

223
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,743
She used to throw plates at me.

224
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:39,078
She couldn't handle her booze.

225
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,580
That's how I got the scars
on the back of my neck.

226
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:42,248
Baby, you have no idea

227
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,617
how many times I wanted to
tell you over the years,

228
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:48,120
but the more time went on,
the more unreal it all seemed.

229
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:52,124
Look like a douche bag
with that mullet.

230
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,128
Oh, I can't believe this.

231
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,464
Guess we can forget
about buying a house.

232
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,632
KEVIN Yeah.

233
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,833
Maybe not.

234
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,268
What do you mean?

235
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,103
You don't actually have
to get married, do you?

236
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,439
I mean, your mom
wants a wedding.

237
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,307
So, give her one.

238
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,244
I could get ordained online.

239
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,112
Then we just don't file
the license with the state.

240
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,680
A fake wedding.

241
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,184
Why not?

242
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:19,352
You'd still be married.

243
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,854
It just won't be legal.

244
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,589
Yeah, but what's
the point then?

245
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,191
All the free shit, baby!

246
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:26,359
Oh. Oh, damn!

247
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,527
Oh, baby, come on.

248
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,995
That would've sucked.

249
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,631
Showing up at your wedding
fucking paralyzed and shit?

250
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:33,933
Yeah. Oh, shit.

251
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,838
Looks a bit like Top Ramen
in there, doesn't it?

252
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,310
Sweetie, would you like
me to come with you

253
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,845
to your the biopsy?

254
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,914
No, it's probably nothing.

255
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,949
A benign cyst.

256
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,150
An ingrown hair.

257
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:52,718
Yes, I think you're right.

258
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,754
You're gonna be just fine.

259
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,160
Why the hell are you crying?

260
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,802
I knew it was
too good to be true.

261
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,370
You're gonna die.

262
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,172
Jesus, Sheila,
I'm not gonna die.

263
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,174
I haven't even had
the biopsy yet.

264
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,576
It was probably that
nut-vise sex toy

265
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,144
of hers that gave
you the damn cancer.

266
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm gonna need the house
next week for Bible study.

267
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,516
We're doing the
Passion Play again.

268
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,585
It might get noisy.

269
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,163
I have two plots

270
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,165
at Oak Woods Cemetery.

271
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,200
One was for Eddie.

272
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,902
Nothing would make me happier

273
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,571
than to bury you
in one of them.

274
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,675
Wait there for me.

275
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,746
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

276
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,483
<i>He married your father and I,</i>

277
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,118
Aunt Rochelle, Uncle Bobby,
and cousin Jimmy with the...

278
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:00,419
you know, that
first wife of his,

279
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:01,721
the one with the cleft palate.

280
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,389
A cleft palate

281
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,625
is merely the mark God leaves

282
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,993
when he kisses a person

283
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,761
before they're born.

284
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,930
That girl's mama
just skipped the folic acid.

285
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,531
I'm gonna need you both

286
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:16,702
to come to my weekend
Engagement Encounter retreat.

287
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,104
It covers all of the.

288
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,539
Pre-Cana material necessary

289
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,875
for you to be married
with God's blessing.

290
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,244
Uh, could you excuse us
for just a second, please?

291
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,216
Might be kind of fun to do
it at a church outing, huh?

292
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,884
Veronica, that man
in there is a priest.

293
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:33,552
He's gonna require a license.

294
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:34,754
A marriage license.

295
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:37,089
And I'm pretty sure
bigamy is still a felony

296
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,958
in the state of Illinois.

297
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,060
Why did you let your mom
drag us down here?

298
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,595
You know that Mama
wasn't gonna take no.

299
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,096
What about Fiona?
Wasn't she gonna marry us?

300
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:46,132
Relax, baby. I got this.

301
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,601
You know what, Mama?

302
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:51,137
We already have someone that's
gonna do the wedding for us.

303
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,873
Is this some healing hands,
voodoo, wheat grass jackass?

304
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,975
Because that is not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes.

305
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,143
Go ahead, tell them, Father.

306
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,477
Tell them

307
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,613
that it's not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes.

308
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,615
Well, I know this...

309
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,253
that just like the honeybee,
God has many eyes.

310
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:10,122
Look, it has to be a priest.

311
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:12,158
That's what your father
wanted, that's what I want

312
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,793
and that's what the Lord wants.

313
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,697
Wedding's not gonna work.

314
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,798
What happened?

315
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,399
Mama wants a real priest.

316
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,468
Sheila said she'd make your
wedding dress, if you want.

317
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,837
Oh, that's nice, but what
good is a dress

318
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,539
if I don't have a priest?

319
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,007
You could hire an actor.

320
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,242
Remember the guy who played
Elmo at my birthday party?

321
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:31,677
You remember that?

322
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,778
He took his head off.

323
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:34,580
It was traumatizing.

324
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:35,948
You think an actor could work?

325
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,349
You know what?
I could probably get.

326
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,151
Father Pete to do it
if Carl will help.

327
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:41,520
What's it gonna cost me?

328
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,289
Uh, Karen and I use your place
Friday night?

329
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:44,290
Done.

330
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:45,991
Father Pete, the groper?

331
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,293
God willing.

332
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,861
We got hot dogs?

333
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,730
Mmm, no hot dogs.

334
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,071
What?

335
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,411
Excuse me.

336
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,480
Better late than never.

337
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:10,216
Even better on time.
What's with the costume?

338
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,220
ROTC. I made Cadet
Lieutenant Colonel today.

339
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,521
You did? That's great!
Yeah.

340
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:16,489
Congratulations.

341
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,657
When I get back,

342
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:19,925
I want the new stock shelved

343
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,494
with all of the labels
facing the same direction.

344
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:22,495
Where are you going?

345
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,296
Your head is like a funnel.

346
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:25,431
The Boy Scout trip
is this weekend.

347
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,833
They have Muslim Boy Scouts?

348
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,468
It's similar. The motto
is still "Be prepared,"

349
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:31,203
but you learn how
to work with chemicals

350
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:32,338
instead of tying knots.

351
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,407
The troop is sponsored
by the Baptist church.

352
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,009
They give us free outfits
and overnights,

353
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,444
and we let 'em think
we're assimilating.

354
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,846
Everybody wins.

355
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,082
I'll be back Sunday night.

356
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,652
Lieutenant Colonel?

357
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm so proud of you.

358
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,322
It's not that big of a deal.

359
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,258
Linda and the boys are
gone for two nights.

360
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:55,628
We're gonna have a whole night
together to celebrate.

361
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:18,584
Oh, God!
Good God!

362
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:19,819
I'm sorry!

363
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,986
Jesus Christ!

364
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,822
Was that the biopsy?!

365
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,356
I'm gonna take a look.

366
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm just gonna take a look.

367
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,566
Okay, well,

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,601
that is definitely better.

369
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:38,103
I think you're okay.

370
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:41,073
Well, now, yeah.

371
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,008
I'm just gonna shave you, okay?

372
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,215
I've never been shaved down
there before.

373
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,517
Just doing a small section.

374
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,559
Okay? Oh!

375
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,661
I'm sorry about that.

376
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,500
Maybe I could come back later

377
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,469
and you could shave
the other two.

378
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:15,608
There. All done.

379
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:19,712
Ooh! It feels like Spring!

380
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,717
Wish I could say
this wasn't gonna hurt.

381
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,122
You don't have to go
too crazy here, Sheila,

382
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:32,358
but as close to Vera Wang
as you can get.

383
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:34,460
You are going to make
a beautiful bride.

384
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:36,762
Aw, Sheila, you're making
me feel like Cinderella.

385
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:37,930
Aw...

386
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:40,966
Screw Cinderella.
Little doe-eyed bitch.

387
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,736
Probably one of the worst role
models for little girls.

388
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,338
I think Cinderella was
a feminist.

389
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,574
The whole idea of marriage is
a useless vestige

390
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,843
of an archaic civilization.

391
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:52,311
How would you know?

392
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:54,013
I watched one unravel.

393
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:57,983
Oh, so one example of a bad one
makes them all bad, hmm?

394
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,785
Hmm? In olden times,
marriage was nothing more

395
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,454
than a legal exchange
of women for property.

396
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,656
Maybe you're being
a little pessimistic.

397
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,858
It's just a piece of paper!

398
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:08,360
A birth certificate
is just a piece of paper.

399
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:10,796
And money... money is
just a piece of paper.

400
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,799
But those are pretty valuable.

401
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,167
True.

402
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,969
Hey, Gloria Steinem,
enough of the blah-blah.

403
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,671
Let's talk bachelorette party.

404
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,506
I got that covered,
don't worry.

405
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,141
Oh, you better.
Mm-hmm.

406
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:23,943
♪ 'Cause we gonna be doing it ♪

407
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,444
♪ Uh-huh, mm-hmm! ♪
You sing it, lady!

408
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,445
Let's go. Let's go!

409
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,714
<i>Feeling sick,</i>

410
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:31,150
feeling tired,
seeing more of my oncologist

411
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:35,220
than I see of my whole family.

412
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:38,924
The hardest thing for me
to accept is the fact

413
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,459
that I can't fix this.

414
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,561
I'm so used to being the mom,
you know?

415
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:48,167
The one who takes care
of everyone and everything.

416
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,535
The fixer.

417
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,537
And this is breast cancer.

418
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:57,543
I can't fix this.

419
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:01,080
Just knowing your tits are
trying to kill you...

420
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,648
that's gotta suck.

421
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,317
I mean, mine's in my balls.

422
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,953
At least they've got a reason
to be pissed.

423
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:11,890
Tucked between two legs,
wedged right near your asshole.

424
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:16,228
There's no good way to sit,
no underwear that's been devised

425
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:19,565
to hold 'em
effectively in place.

426
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,767
They're a bizarre appendage.

427
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,135
An afterthought.

428
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:26,472
Which is why I don't believe in
intelligent design.

429
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,741
There is no God.

430
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,543
We're all gonna die.

431
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,883
Why do I have to do it?

432
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,385
'Cause you're the only one

433
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,053
who's young enough
to be an altar boy.

434
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,988
We'll stop him before
anything goes down.

435
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:44,056
Or anyone.

436
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,730
The Gallagher boys.

437
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,932
If you're here to steal
the noon offering basket,

438
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,034
you're out of luck.

439
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,069
Already off to the bank.
No, no.

440
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:00,072
Carl here is interested
in being an altar boy.

441
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:01,407
That's a big responsibility.

442
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,875
Yeah, we know.

443
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:04,810
We tried talking him out of it,
but he cried and cried,

444
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:06,011
so we thought we'd bring him in,

445
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,579
see if you thought
he had what it takes.

446
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:10,382
Hello there, Carl.

447
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,485
Be back for ya in a bit, bud.

448
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,727
Want to watch <i>Scarface</i>
again tonight?

449
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,128
Can't. Got a date.

450
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:25,664
Ooh, a Mandy date or Kash date?

451
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,332
Kash date.

452
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,768
You're a slut, man.

453
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,405
Shit!

454
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,144
Looks like we have a priest
for V's wedding.

455
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,548
A fake priest?

456
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,016
No, no, priest is real.

457
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,684
We're just not gonna file
the license.

458
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:46,852
A little immoral,
don't you think?

459
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:47,986
Like lying to God's face?

460
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,021
Really, Mr. Morality?

461
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,023
Whose car is this that we're in?

462
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:52,591
It's not like I have
a priest in the back.

463
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,827
Are you still picking up
the cake?

464
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,295
Angelica's Bakery.

465
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,064
Hey, can Kev and V use
this car for their big exit

466
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,165
after the reception?

467
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,366
Uh, yeah, I think
that could work.

468
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:02,768
I just, I need it back
right after.

469
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:04,369
Okay.

470
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:05,804
You can't do anything
bad to it.

471
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,573
And no sex in it.

472
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:08,774
No sex in it?

473
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:14,046
I just need this thing
in perfect condition.

474
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,114
All right, Fiona,

475
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,648
I just... Whoa, whoa!

476
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,283
Aw, damn it! Damn it!

477
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,119
Jesus!

478
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,120
Relax, relax.

479
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,321
It happens, okay?

480
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,623
Yeah? What happens,
prison time?

481
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,634
Hey, Fiona.

482
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,503
I thought that was you.

483
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:39,671
Your uniform looks different.

484
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,641
Yeah, they issued new coats.

485
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,810
See you at Kev and Veronica's
wedding tomorrow?

486
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:47,946
Yeah. I'm gonna need to see your
license and registration, sir.

487
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:51,016
What? Why, Officer, sir?

488
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,885
Well, you were
doing 35 in a 25.

489
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,119
And there was some swerving.

490
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:55,554
That was kind of weird.

491
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,723
Here's my license,
but I actually don't have

492
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,458
the registration.
It's actually my friend's car.

493
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:02,094
You really are supposed to
have that on you at all times.

494
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,729
Let me see what I can do.

495
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:04,830
I'll be right back.

496
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:05,998
Okay.

497
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,699
Why did you give him
your license?!

498
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:08,734
That's not my real license.

499
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:10,302
Yeah, so now what? We run?

500
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:11,803
No, that never works.

501
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,540
Jesus, you got me?

502
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,941
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

503
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,576
Well, who's Jesus?

504
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,345
Follow car.
Always use a follow car.

505
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,160
Watch your speed, sir.
See you at the wedding, Fi.

506
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:36,428
Okay!

507
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:37,763
Out.
What?

508
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:39,665
Get out!
Oh!

509
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:46,104
What about the car?

510
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,839
Taken care of.

511
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,049
My heart's in my
throat right now.

512
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,550
It's adrenaline.
It's kinda cool, isn't it?

513
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,064
I'll see you at the wedding.

514
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,398
What?

515
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,368
Angelica's Bakery, right?
Yeah, right.

516
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:22,241
<i>I've decided to start
wearing</i> <i>a tie every day.</i>

517
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,078
I could die at any moment.

518
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:29,681
I thought it'd be nice
to look my best

519
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,384
for the Grim Reaper.
Son of a bitch.

520
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,321
You know what?

521
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,556
Fuck him.

522
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:39,958
Fuck him!

523
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,793
Why give him the satisfaction?

524
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:43,061
I'll do it myself.

525
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:44,630
Take my own goddamn life.

526
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,268
You know...

527
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,036
you know what the real shame

528
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,471
of it is, Kev?

529
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:58,577
The real shame is there are so
many things I still want to do.

530
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,379
Oh, yeah? Like what?

531
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,418
Jesus Christ! I don't know.

532
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:07,853
I don't know!

533
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:09,821
How sad is that?

534
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:12,991
A man who doesn't even know
what he wants to do.

535
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:14,326
Whoo-hoo!

536
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,927
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, buddy!

537
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,129
What's this?

538
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,997
You gotta wear it tonight
for the bachelor party.

539
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:21,566
Everyone's gonna be
wearing one.

540
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,735
Andy, get the fuck out of here.
I'm not gonna...

541
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,504
Don't be a dick, dude!
Fuckin' wear it!

542
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:26,905
Bachelor party?

543
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,742
Yeah, if you wanna go,
you can come.

544
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,377
What's the plan?

545
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:34,246
Me and my friends are gonna get

546
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,614
wasted and do some stupid shit.

547
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,382
But we gotta get you one
of these.

548
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:43,789
Awesome.

549
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,791
Is the blindfold
for the element of surprise

550
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:47,492
or so I don't know
where you live?

551
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,560
A little of both.

552
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:51,797

Oh.

556
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:02,507
Wow, yeah.

557
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,842
This is your house.

558
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:06,078
Where you live with Linda...

559
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,112
and the kids.

560
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:09,081
And now it's our house.

561
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,672
What's wrong?

562
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,640
Sorry.
It's just, it's too weird.

563
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:36,808
What is?

564
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:38,110
All of your shit.

565
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:39,811
It's, it's freaking me out!

566
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:41,513
It smells like goats
in here, man.

00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:43,215
Ian, wait!

568
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:04,069
But why would she do it

569
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:06,004
in the first place, Fi?

570
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,539
Because she could!

571
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,175
She was like one of those
weird Chinese acrobats.

572
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,676
Oh! No, those
girls are all tiny

573
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,011
and cute when they do it!

574
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:16,014
She was like Pippi Longstocking
kissing her own ass!

00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,550
Jesus!

00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:21,386
Dad, what the hell
happened to you?

577
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:22,788
Cord was too long.

578
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:25,490
I got three nuts. Gonna die.

579
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,930

nasty-ass hair about?

Surprise!

586

I'm the maid of honor at your
fake wedding

587
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,261
and I didn't even know
you had a brother.

588
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:37,963
There's a reason for that.

589
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,764
He busted out of prison?
Last night.

590
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:40,866
What was he in for?

591
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,268
Aggravated assault,
larceny and arson.

592
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:44,870
Arson? Who we talkin' about?

593
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,938
V's brother.

594
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,773
Oh, is that like
a sibling-brother,

595
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:50,041
or just a black guy brother?

596
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,244
You remember the fire at
the Curves in the mini mall?

597
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:53,612
That was him.

598
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,647
He loves setting fire to
things and he hates women.

599
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:57,616
It was the perfect storm.
He's nuts.

600
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,784
No, I'm serious. He's nuts.
He came at me.

601
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,254
I had to fight my ass off.
Then, one time,

602
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,122
I'm having a brew,
he came up to me,

603
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:05,724
he's all,
"Ass cunt fuck!" on me.

604
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,093
- Is he retarded?
- I wish.

605
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:11,129
Tourette's coupled with bipolar
disorder and a drinking problem.

606
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:12,931
He's a shrink's wet dream.

607
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:15,033
What are we gonna do?

608
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,501
Kick his ass back to prison

609
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:18,803
'cause if there's one person
you can always count on

610
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,539
to really fuck things up,
it's Marty.

611
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,940
Bungee jumping, eh?

612
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:24,042
From the El tracks.

613
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:27,245
Good news/bad: your biopsy
results came back negative.

614
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
Tumor was benign,

615
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,049
so you're not gonna die
of testicular cancer.

616
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,319
Oh! Oh, thank God! Oh!

617
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:35,987
Oh! So, I can keep it?

618
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:39,758
Yeah. The swelling on the brain
you've probably got going

619
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,726
on in there
might end up doin' you in.

620
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,527
What?!

621
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:43,495
I'm fuckin' with you.

622
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,498
The bump looks
pretty superficial,

623
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:49,734
but if you vomit more than
twice, have any seizures

624
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,037
or experience memory loss,
call 911.

625
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:55,941
Well, what if I vomit
while I'm having a seizure

626
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:57,742
and have no memory of it?

627
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,210
Tree in the forest, my friend.

628
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,513
What?

629
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:06,918
You know you can't stay, Marty.

630
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,820
You gotta go back to prison.

631
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:10,855
Look, Ron,
it's bullshit security.

632
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,657
They practically give you
your own key.

633
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,192
Aren't you risking your parole?

634
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:16,361
How long did you have left?

635
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,529
18... cocksucker!... months!

636
00:29:17,563 --> 00:29:19,364
Jesus, Marty,
that's no time at all.

637
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:20,632
It's your wedding day, Ron.

638
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,367
Why don't you go back
and turn yourself in?

639
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,469
Tell 'em it was a mistake.
Blame it on the Tourette's.

640
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:26,605
Tell them that it
won't happen again.

641
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,274
You know it's for the best.
Faggot!

642
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,377
I'm gonna go get cleaned up,
and we'll have you back

643
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:33,578
before they even know you left.

644
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,046
Look, I'm not going back, Ron!

645
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,549
It's your wedding day
and I'm not gonna miss your...

646
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,517
shit-pisser... wedding day!

647
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:52,263
This is the dress that
I will wear this afternoon.

648
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:58,603
And it will protect me
like this house protects me.

649
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:01,840
This is the dress.

650
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:04,776
And today is the day.

651
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,345
And the day is good.

652
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,014
You look nice.

653
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,548
Where are you pretending to go?

654
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,752
I'm going to a wedding today.

655
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:16,688
I am really gonna do it
this time.

656
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:20,291
And it's supposed to be
a beautiful day today.

657
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:25,463
Beautiful and safe and sunny.

658
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:27,565
The sun's just
a burning ball of fire

659
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,301
that could plunge
from the sky at any time.

660
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:37,475
I think we should just
let him come to the wedding.

661
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,544
No way. I'm not having that
nutcase at my wedding.

662
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,414
Can you imagine the service?
"Do you Veronica...

663
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:44,883
"Fucking bitch!... Fisher

664
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,651
"take this man...

665
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,787
"Fuck stick!... Kevin Ball...?"

666
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:51,556
Uh-uh, no, I'm taking
him back to prison

667
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,592
where he belongs if I gotta drag
his ass back there myself.

668
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:56,895
Always happens
when he's off his meds.

669
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,564
Right. Give me your dress
so I can steam it.

670
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,332
Behind the door.

671
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:06,738
No.

672
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,440
Bathroom door.

673
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:10,875
It's a real pretty dress, Roni.

674
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,113
It'll burn nicely
with all this taffeta.

675
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:18,450
Oh, Jesus.

676
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:21,252
You send me back to jail,
this dress goes up!

677
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:23,321
This house goes up!
We all go up!

678
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:28,460
Marty? Marty, open the door.

679
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,462
Open the goddamn door!

680
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:33,798
You're not getting married
without me.

681
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,834
Cock fuck!

682
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,471
He's not doing anything.

683
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:41,573
He's sitting in there
lighting a lighter.

684
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,608
Oh, my God, he's gonna
burn the house down.

685
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:45,443
This is what he did
at Granddaddy's funeral.

686
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,545
Gutted out half the hospice.
Maybe we should call the cops.

687
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,747
Kev's right. The house goes up

688
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,982
we're not gonna be able
to get him out of there.

689
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,084
You want me to call
cops on my own brother?

690
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,519
It's always been like this.

691
00:31:54,553 --> 00:31:56,454
Nobody else could ever
be the center of attention.

692
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:58,123
It's always got
to be about him.

693
00:31:58,157 --> 00:31:59,390
You should be in a nuthouse!

694
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:00,658
What's going on?

695
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,093
Veronica's brother locked
himself in the bathroom.

696
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,295
He's threatening to burn
the place down. Cool!

697
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,699
He saying that he's gonna
light both the dress and

698
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,967
the shit-sack house on fire.

699
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:11,035
What's a shit-sack?

700
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,838
All I wanted was
to own my own home

701
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:15,840
and maybe some small
kitchen appliances

702
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,409
for your, for me,
for our home...

703
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:19,944
Maybe some kids someday.

704
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,013
I thought you didn't want
to have any kids.

705
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,114
Based on what?

706
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,616
You saying
how much you hate 'em.

707
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,050
Yeah, other people's.

708
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:28,953
But I might not mind having
a baby Kev runnin' round.

709
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,556
A little "tomorrow person"?

710
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,791
What?

711
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,659
That's what I call
little mixed-race babies:

712
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:36,027
Tomorrow people.

713
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:38,730
Little people of tomorrow.

714
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,199
What are we gonna do?

715
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,568
Maybe we should
just call it off.

716
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:44,869
No, not a chance.

717
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:46,337
Baby, listen, this our time.

718
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:50,642
We're gonna get fake married,
and nothing's gonna stop us.

719
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,915
Tomorrow people?

720
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:58,817
Tomorrow people.

721
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:05,023
Hey, can you sign in
for me at detention today?

722
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:08,827
Mrs. Pinder won't notice.
She's almost blind.

723
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,195
You ditchin'?

724
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,529
Kash has something planned.

725
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:14,132
I thought that was last night.

726
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,633
Was supposed to be,

727
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:17,902
but he took me to his place,

728
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:19,337
and it sort of freaked me out.

729
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,840
I mean, I always knew
he had a wife

730
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,709
and a life and everything,
but seeing it and...

731
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:25,944
and smelling it...

732
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:28,079
I mean, his life
actually has an odor.

733
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,686
What was that for?

734
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,623
I just felt like kissing
my boyfriend.

735
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:40,725
Have fun fucking Kash.

736
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:56,574
Remember when we were little,

737
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,943
and you'd always tag along
with me, wherever I went?

738
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,148
I always looked after you,
didn't I, Marty?

739
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:06,217
And do you know why?

740
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,820
Because I'm your
big little sister

741
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:13,091
and I didn't want you to get in
trouble, because I love you.

742
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,560
And that's why I want you
to go back to prison.

743
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:20,732
But you know what?

744
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:24,302
I've been thinking about my
wedding, and you know something?

745
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,604
You were right...

746
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,575
'cause my wedding day
wouldn't be my wedding day

747
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,543
without my little
big brother there.

748
00:34:35,981 --> 00:34:40,952
In fact, I'd like you to be
the one to give me away.

749
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:44,822
Marty?

750
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:52,931
You mean it?

751
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,933
Cross my heart.

752
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,034
Come here, you little nut.

753
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:02,040
Ah! Ah!

754
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:05,843
You bitches!
You bitches lied to me!

755
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,648

Yeah. Here to pick up Karen.

763
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,185
What's with the vest?

764
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,853
Sheils made it.

765
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,656
Wow...

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,391

You look beautiful.

Thanks.

768
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,860
Hi, Lip.

769
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:57,862
Hi. Does my head look bigger?

770
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:00,999
Um... I don't think it can get

771
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,133
any bigger, Dad.

772
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,135
I have to keep an eye on it.

773
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:06,070
Watch for memory
loss and vomit.

774
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,105
More so than usual?

775
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,373
Know what?

776
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,875
I have a second chance at life.

777
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,276
Mm-hmm.

778
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,879
I'm not gonna surround myself
with negative energy.

779
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:18,316
How about you just show up
at this wedding,

780
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,586
do what you do best: drink
free booze and look happy?

781
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,587
Yes?

782
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:27,892
All right, Frank, I am ready.

783
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,193
You're coming, Mom?

784
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,628
Yes, I'm coming.

785
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:31,996
She's not going anywhere.

786
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:36,200
I've got my purse
and my gift and my gloves

787
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,871
and my selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor

788
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:43,474
and my monoamine
oxidase inhibitor.

789
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:46,010
I have my anti-anxiety
disco biscuits.

790
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:49,313
And I am ready to go.

791
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:51,416
I am really ready.

792
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:12,236
I'll just get you
a piece of cake, Mom.

793
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,880
That would just be...

794
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:25,950
...wonderful, sweetheart.

795
00:37:25,984 --> 00:37:28,152
There's just so much
I've gotta get done here.

796
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:45,903
Ah, that bitch.

797
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:49,040
What kind of... cock-fuck...
does this to her brother?

798
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:04,622
May daily problems never cause
you undue anxiety,

799
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:08,860
nor the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives,

800
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:12,163
but may your hearts' first
desire be always the good things

801
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:14,832
waiting for you in
the life of heaven.

802
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,033
Amen.

803
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:17,034
Amen!

804
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,537
You may kiss the bride.

805
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:28,880
Oh, yeah!

806
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:29,914
Yeah!

807
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,653
Get it out!

808
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:44,262
Whoo!

809
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:45,930
Whoo!

810
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:48,666
Get some, Father!

811
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,575
Go, Dad! Work it!

812
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:05,383
Take it down! Take it down!

813
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:11,889
♪ Say what you gotta say,
what you gotta... ♪

814
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,560

815
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:17,762

♪ Say it like you own it... ♪

818
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:31,075
Uh, folks, let's face facts.

819
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:34,245
When it comes to good things,
most of 'em come

820
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:37,081
in pairs
like your favorite jeans,

821
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:40,384
new socks and Kevin
and Veronica.

822
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:44,322
And as it turns out,
most people's testicles.

823
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:52,063
So here's to the happy couple,
Kevin, Veronica, may you always

824
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,932
only have two testicles
between ya. <i>L'chaim!</i>

825
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,269
<i>L'chaim!</i>

826
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:03,474
Oh... oh, sweetheart,

827
00:40:03,508 --> 00:40:05,943
may the good Lord
watch over you

828
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:07,111
in your new home.

829
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:08,879
Oh, thank you, Mama.

830
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:10,281
Thank you.

831
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:16,821
$500?!

832
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:18,489
Are you fucking kidding me?

833
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,995
We're gettin'
a Barbie house, baby!

834
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:29,267
Maybe you're making
yourself too available?

835
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,468
You think?

836
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:33,738
Hey, lady friend,
where the hell is my cake?

837
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:37,241
Steve is supposed to be here
with the damn thing.

838
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:39,610
That's the trouble
with the exciting ones.

839
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,613
The unpredictability is what
makes them so exciting,

840
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,484
but it's also what makes them
so damned unpredictable.

841
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:48,419
He may not be Steve,

842
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,288
but he's here.

843
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:56,060
Hi.

844
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:57,928
Hi.

845
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,330
Do you wanna dance?

846
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:00,564
The Bible is the Word of God,

847
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,234
How can it be the Word
of God passed down

848
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:08,172
if it was rewritten by King James?
from generation to generation.

849
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:11,375
It doesn't make any sense.

850
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,745
This was really a perfect day.

851
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,948
I only wish little Marty
could have been here.

852
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:50,881
You're late...

853
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,516
Dr. Sherman.

854
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:09,467
Okay, Gallaghers,

855
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,701
you're the only family I got,

856
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,603
so let's put this on film, huh?

857
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,373
Ah.

858
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,474
Wait... Is it on?

859
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:19,076
It's on. It's on, it's on.

860
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:20,111
Did it go?
It's not on.

861
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:22,279
- Go get...
- Aah!

862
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:24,515
Set it up again, here we go.

863
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:25,516
Ready?

864
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,550
Okay.
Here we go.

865
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,152
Hey, sexy.

866
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,055
Wait, where's Lip?

867
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,590
Where...? Oh.

868
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:34,492
Yeah...

869
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:37,628
Yeah, oh, yeah, give it to me!

870
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:39,096
Oh, yeah.

871
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:41,766
Oh, oh, yeah!

872
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,067
Oh, yeah, give it to me!

873
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:45,136
Oh, you want me to give it to you?
Yes.

874
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,904
Yes, she said she wants you

875
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,507
to give it to her, so just
give it to her already, okay?!

876
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:52,076
Cock and balls!

877
00:42:56,181 --> 00:43:06,050

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

878
00:43:22,974 --> 00:43:26,744
And she was a real princess.

879
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:29,146
Yeah, well, she's dead now.

880
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:31,982
How's that
for happily ever after?

881
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:39,055
Asshole.
