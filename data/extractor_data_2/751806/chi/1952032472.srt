4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
忠诚问题

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,118
彼特 出版物规定第二稿周四前能交吧？
You'll have yourredraft on establishment levels by Thursday?

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,555
这么早就得交？
You need it that early?

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,356
我倒用不着那么早
I don't need it that early,

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,956
但大臣见特别委员会之前得先读一下
but the Ministerhas to read it before facing the select committee.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,556
何况他还要记下来呢
What makes it harder, he has to remember it.

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,678
更何况他还得理解一下呢
Harderstill, he has to understand it.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,719
对了 彼特 大臣的华盛顿演讲是你写的吗
Incidentally, did you write the Minister's Washington speech?

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,152
是啊 汉弗莱爵士
Yes, Sir Humphrey.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,357
不错 写得不错     谢谢 汉弗莱爵士
Splendid. Well done. Thank you, Sir Humphrey.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,476
大臣到办公室了
The Minister's in now.

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,393
好 谢谢大家
Good. Right, thank you all.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,269
伯纳 大臣出差一周 你很幸福吧?
Have you enjoyed having your Ministeraway fora week?

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,432
说不上 有些工作不太好开展      是吗?
Not very much. Makes things very difficult.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,955
哦 伯纳
Ah, Bernard

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,351
大臣不在根本就是天赐良机啊
A Minister's absence is a godsend

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,830
终于可以好好工作了
You can do the job properly foronce.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,915
没他那些傻问题 灵机一动 整天操心报纸
No silly questions, no bright ideas, no fussing about the papers.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,595
伯纳 我有时怀疑大臣不上报纸
I think our Minister doesn't believe he exists

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,876
就感觉不到自己的存在
unless he's in the papers.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,395
我跟你赌 他回到办公室 第一句话就是
I'll bet the first thing he says is,

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,120
"我的华盛顿演讲有媒体报道吗"?
"Any reports on my Washington speech?"

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,077
赌多少?     一磅
Howmuch? A pound.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,471
赌了 他不会问的 他已经问过了
Done. He won't because he's already asked

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,835
从机场回来的路上就问了
In the caron the way back from Heathrow.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,958
有进步 伯纳 坐下吧
You're learning, Bernard. Sit down.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,112
瞧见了吧 大臣不在还能让人进步
See why a Minister's absence is a good thing?

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,239
嗯 可工作积了这么多     这好说
Yes, but so much work piles up. There we are.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,190
走之前请示几天 回来之后汇报几天
With a couple of days' briefing before and debriefing after

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,999
整整两周没他在这里碍手碍脚
he's out of ourhairfora fortnight.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,993
接下来的半年 一旦他抱怨什么事没请示
Lfhe complains ofbeing uninformed,

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,799
就说那时他不在
say it came up while he was away.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,713
所以才举行这么多高峰会议?
Hence so many summit conferences?

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,348
当然 这是我国立国之本啊
That's the only way the country works

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,672
把权力集中到10号 然后送首相去参加
Concentrate all the power at Number 10 then send the PM away

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,470
欧共体峰会 北约峰会 联邦峰会 什么都行
to EEC, NATO, Commonwealth summits, anywhere

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,679
内阁秘书才能好好管理国家啊
Then the Cabinet Secretary can run the country properly.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,513
反正 我们现在就得见他
We ought to see him now.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,638
你对彼特写的华盛顿演讲怎么看?
What do you think of the Washington speech?

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,271
"英国政府是忠诚高效的楷模"
"British administration as a model of loyalty and efficiency.

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,353
"严厉打击铺张浪费 彻底削减官僚主义"
A ruthless waron waste, cutting bureaucracy to the bone.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,432
"全世界都可以借鉴英国"   能证明是真的吗?
Britain can teach the world" Can we prove it?

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,549
哦 伯纳 演讲之妙并不在于大臣说真话
A good speech isnt where we can prove he's telling the truth.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,429
而在于没人能证明他撒谎
It's one in which nobody else can prove he's lying

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,879
但我还是...当然彼特写得很好 但我有点担心
But even so, I'm sure itwas good,

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,431
这场演讲 听众是否觉得太无聊了点
but I justwondered whether it was boring forthe audience.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,873
当然无聊了
Of course itwas boring

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,189
无聊透顶啊
Bored the pants of them

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,750
要坐在那听完 简直就是恐怖      我以为...
Ghastly to have to sit through it, I should think

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,071
大臣的演讲不是写给听众的 伯纳
Ministers' speeches aren'twritten forthe audience.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,309
不是吗?
Aren't they?

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,112
发表演讲只是例行公事 为了上报纸
Delivering a speech is just a formality to get into the papers.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,273
不能考虑娱乐性 我们又不是编喜剧
We can'tworry about entertaining We're notwriting fora comedian

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,113
至少不是专业的
Well, not a professional one

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,832
重要的是该讲什么讲什么
The point is the speech said the right things.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,118
那为什么要公开讲呢     这很重要
But why say it in public? It's vital.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,115
白纸黑字印出来 大臣才会在委员会维护我们
Once printed, the Minister defend us in select committees.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
他总会维护我们的吧     那是有限度的 伯纳
He defends us anyway. Well... only to a point, Bernard.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,835
因为一旦出了差错
Once something goes wrong,

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,120
大臣首先想到的就是推在部属身上
the Minister's first instinct is to rat on his department.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,033
所以演讲要印下来 让他站稳立场
We must nail his trousers to the mast.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,988
您是说表明立场?     不 站稳立场
You mean nail his colours? No, his trousers.

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,833
省得他脚底抹油 走吧
Then he can't climb down Come on.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,513
欢迎回来 大臣     你好 汉弗莱
Welcome home, Minister Hello, Humphrey.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,708
伯纳 你不是说有关于我演讲的剪报吗?
Bernard, didn't you say there were press cuttings on my speech?

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,917
是的 大臣 我放在盒子里了
Yes, I put them in the box, Minister.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,630
大臣 您知道明天委员会的听证至关重要吧
Minister, you do realise the importance of tomorrow's hearing?

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,189
可不是 媒体都会在场
Indeed. The press will be there.

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,033
不仅仅是媒体的问题 大臣
It's notjust a question of the press.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,317
这是要审查本部的未来工作
It's a scrutiny of this department's future operation.

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,836
要是我们表现得铺张浪费 或者玩忽职守
If it emerged thatwe were extravagant or incompetent...

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,992
我们有铺张浪费或者玩忽职守吗?     当然没有
Are we extravagant or incompetent? Of course not.

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,517
但委员会里有人心怀不轨 特别是德贝郡那位
But there are hostile members especially one for Derbyshire.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,070
天 贝蒂・欧汉不会来吧?     唉 是的
No Betty Oldham won't be there? Yes, alas.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,189
请您先牢记这份简报 大臣 有问题就问我
I urge you to masterthis brief and ask if you have any problems.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,512
又是简报? 回来的飞机上我刚记住一份
Anotherbrief? I've only just mastered one.

80
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,910
是吗? 讲什么的?
Really? Whatwas in it?

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,951
记不住了
I can't remember.

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,910
坐飞机没法集中注意力 又是饮料又是电影的
Difficult to concentrate on a plane, all those drinks

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,076
打个瞌睡也要被吵醒     当然 大臣
And they wake you up. Of course, Minister.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,755
您醒着确实不容易集中注意力
Frightfully difficult to concentrate if you keep being woken up.

85
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,514
说真的 就这一份简报
Seriously, this is the only brief

86
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,070
概括了人家会问的问题
with possible questions from the committee

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,028
非常谨慎适当地阐述了我们的立场
with appropriate answers carefully presented to give ourposition.

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,236
绝对精确吗?
Is it absolutely accurate?

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,312
谨慎而适当 阐述了我们的立场
They're carefully presented to give ourposition.

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,072
你说委员会很重要 不能显得我在误导他们
I cannot be seen to mislead them.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,913
不会显得您在误导他们的
You will not be seen to mislead them.

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,878
都是事实?     只有事实
The truth? And nothing but.

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,190
全部事实?     当然不是
The whole truth? Of course not.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,432
就说我们有所保留?     绝对不行
We tell them we keep secrets? Indeed not

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,919
为什么不行?
Why not?

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,757
"保守秘密的人必须同时保守"
"He thatwould keep a secret must keep it secret,

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,878
"他有秘密这个秘密"
that he hath the secret to keep".

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,559
这话谁说的?
Who said that?

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,671
那是汉弗莱爵士
Itwas Sir Humphrey.

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,838
谁首创的?     弗朗西斯・培根 对吧
Who said it originally? Francis Bacon, wasn't it?

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,399
哦 对
Oh, yes.

102
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,358
怎么大臣不管干嘛都有简报?
Why can'twe go anywhere without briefs?

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,035
以免到时穿帮
In case they get caught with theirtrousers down.

104
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,718
穿帮? 补起来嘛
Trousers down Pick them

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,511
很好笑 伯纳
Very droll, Bernard.

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,673
等会还有别的事吗?     您今天没有别的日程
Are we going to be interrupted? Yourdiary's empty today.

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,513
好吧 提醒我 那篇东西讲了什么?
Whatwas in that submission I read?

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,752
或多或少和去年的报告差不多
More or less a rehash of last year's report.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,434
前年的? 再前一年呢?      都是 大臣
And the yearbefore? And the yearbefore that?

110
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,795
从1867年以来就没变过
Yes, eversince 1867.

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,270
只有些修饰润色而已 我们来看一遍吧?
With appropriate alterations. Shall we go through it?

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,710
非得看吗? 我时差还没倒过来呢
Mustwe? I'm still jet-lagged.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,110
随便您 大臣 不过媒体都会到场的
All the press will be there.

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,316
对 还是来看看吧
Right, let's get down to it.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,352
实际上 主席先生 行政事务部
The fact is that the Department of Administrative Affairs

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,798
可靠而高效地提供了
is run to a high standard of efficiency and supports and services

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,999
政府所需一切行政工作
the administrative work of all Government departments,

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,230
这点在部门报告中已经说明
as we've said in oursubmission.

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,153
谢谢 大臣 大家有什么问题吗?
Thank you, Minister. Questions?

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,629
欧汉女士?    谢谢主席
Mrs Oldham? Thank you.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,837
大臣 您知道麦肯・罗德吗?
Minister, have you heard of Malcolm Rhodes?

122
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,233
不知道
No.

123
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,669
罗德曾任行政部助理秘书 于去年辞职
He was assistant secretary in DAA until he resigned last year.

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,798
行政部共有23000人
There are 23,000 people in the DAA.

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,918
对 而他辞职了 或者被悄悄免职了
But he resigned orwas eased out.

126
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,834
之后去美国做管理顾问 最近他写了本书
Became a management consultant and has justwritten a book,

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,150
这是书的校样
this is an advance proof,

128
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,235
其中揭露了英国公务员惊人的浪费行为
he makes astounding allegations of waste of public money,

129
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,595
尤其在贵部门
particularly in yourdepartment.

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,510
主席先生 我能和我的助手讨论一下吗?
Could I have a word with my officials, MrChairman?

131
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,990
知道这回事吗?     没听说还有书啊
Know about this? Not about the book.

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,436
罗德是谁?     麻烦精 不可靠
Who is Rhodes? He's a trouble-maker.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,830
书里讲了什么?     不知道
What's in the book? Don't know.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,195
那我怎么办?     打岔
What do I do? Stall.

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,954
什么打岔?      所谓打岔就是回避问题
"Stall", meaning avoiding answer.

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,680
我知道什么叫打岔
Yes, I knowwhat stall means

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,116
你连伞也不给我一把就推我进了台风眼
You've sent me into a typhoon without even an umbrella

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,316
台风中伞没有用 风会把...
An umbrella's no use in wind...

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,391
闭嘴 伯纳
Shut up, Bernard

140
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,159
您和助手讨论完了吗?
Have you had sufficient consultation with yourofficials?

141
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,639
我...
I...

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,590
我来读读罗德先生揭露的不良现象
Let me read you some scandalous facts Mr Rhodes reveals,

143
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,515
原文如下 "赫里福郡4号补给站"
and I quote, "No 4 supply depot in Herefordshire,

144
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,355
"有2间飞机修理库 现为仓库"
two formeraircraft hangars used only forstores

145
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,752
"也由中央空调昼夜保持70度(21℃)"
but which are centrally-heated to 70 degrees day and night".

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,835
您有何解释?     这种细节问题需要事先查证
What do you say about that? I can't answerwithout priornotice.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,515
不过有可能是真的     是真的 我上周查过了
It might not be true. It is. I checked.

148
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,639
如此铺张浪费 能有什么理由?
What reason can there be forsuch appalling extravagance?

149
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,590
要看存的是什么 有些材料不耐寒
Some materials deteriorate, depending on what it is.

150
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,758
铜质电线
Copperwire.

151
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,512
是啊...铜质电线?
Yes, well... copperwire?

152
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,478
潮湿时可能生锈
It can corrode in damp conditions.

153
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,358
包塑胶皮的
It's plastic-coated.

154
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,999
塑胶皮
Plastic-coated?

155
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,679
我...
I...

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,674
塑胶皮? 我会调查的
Plastic-coated? I'll certainly have it looked into.

157
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,230
他还说 贵部坚持集中采购钢笔 铅笔 回形针
He says you ordering all pens, paperclips and so on centrally

158
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,597
然后按各部门的需求发放
then distributing them against departmental requisitions.

159
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,753
情有可原 批发能节约成本啊
That seems to be quite sensible. Savings through bulk purchase.

160
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,118
据他论证 这样做的实际支出比职员
He demonstrates that this is fourtimes more expensive

161
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,149
自己去大街上买还贵4倍
than if officers bought what they want on the High Street.

162
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,311
挺有趣的
Very interesting.

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,675
果真如此 我们就改革 我们并非顽固的官老爷
If so, we'll change the system. We're not a rigid bureaucracy.

164
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,868
他说他在职期间提过这个建议
He proposed this change when he was in yourdepartment,

165
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,955
但大家安于现状 把它否决了
it was turned down, people were used to the existing procedure

166
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,114
这不是"顽固的官老爷'吗?     我会调查的
How's that forrigid bureaucracy? I'll have it looked into.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,594
会调查?     对
"Looked into"? Yes

168
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,070
上周你的华盛顿演讲中提到
You said in yourWashington speech lastweek

169
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,110
你们部厉行节约 可谓世界楷模
that you conducted a waron waste, teach the world a lesson.

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,308
那又如何解释你们花费75000磅建造
How do you reconcile thatwith spending ?5,000 on a roof garden

171
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,473
凯特灵津贴办公室的楼顶花园呢?
on top of the supplementary benefits office in Kettering?

172
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,239
我...我会...
I'm... I'll...

173
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,075
会调查?     对 我会的
Have it looked into? Yes Yes, I will

174
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
主席先生 行政部常任秘书下周出席委员会
The DAA's Permanent Secretary is due to appearnextweek.

175
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,956
他来回答不是正好吗?
Isn't he the appropriate person to answerthe questions?

176
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,716
谢谢 通知汉弗莱爵士
Thank you. See that Sir Humphrey's notified.

177
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,316
也许您也该让他看看这些指责?
Perhaps you might let him see the allegations?

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,598
"为浪费公款辩白"? "行政大哉问"?
"Allegations of Governmentwaste"? "Big questions to answer"?

179
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,639
大臣 您让我进退两难     那我呢?
You've put me in a difficult position What about me?

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,158
首相要求节约 人家都在节约 就我们在浪费
The PM's demanding economies, we wast all this money

181
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,596
大臣 没人真的在节约 您该知道吧
No one's been saving anything, you should know that

182
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,469
但他们样子做得很好啊
They look as though they have.

183
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,598
您不能打岔吗?     什么打岔?
Couldn't you have stalled? Stalled?

184
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,354
转移焦点
Blurred things a bit.

185
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,239
您最会转移焦点啊     什么?
You're good at blurring the issue. What?

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,472
您有卓越的才华 能让状况难以理解 大臣
You have a considerable talent formaking things unintelligible.

187
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,872
你说什么     不不 我这是夸您
I beg yourpardon I mean that as a compliment.

188
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,431
转移焦点是大臣的基本技能之一
Blurring the issue is one of the basic ministerial skills.

189
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,919
还有哪些?
And the others?

190
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,389
拖延决策 回避问题
Delaying decisions, dodging questions,

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,269
玩弄数据 歪曲事实 掩盖错误
juggling figures, bending facts and concealing errors.

192
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,635
我该做什么?
Whatwas I to do?

193
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,236
做个样子 实际上什么也不做
Make it look like you'd do something and do nothing.

194
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,231
就像您以前做的一样
Like you usually do.

195
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,633
可如果指责是真的...      很好 大臣 "如果"
But if these revelations are true... Exactly, Minister, "if".

196
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,314
您可以谈真伪问题
You could have discussed truth.

197
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,552
委员会才不关心事情真伪
The committee isn't interested in truth.

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,676
他们都是国会议员
They're all MPs

199
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,235
安全问题呢?     铅笔算哪门子安全问题?
What about a security matter? HB pencils a security matter?

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,270
这要看铅笔写了些什么
Depends what you write with them

201
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,512
办公楼上干吗建花园?
Why build roof gardens on top of offices?

202
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,389
我们用了一家美国公司的设计图
We took overthe office design from an American company,

203
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,236
碰巧没人发现屋顶上有花园
it happens that nobody noticed the roof gardens on the plan

204
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,719
天哪
God

205
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,793
犯了点小错 人之常情嘛
It's a tiny mistake anyone could make.

206
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,078
75000磅叫小错? 那什么叫大错?
Tiny mistake, ?5,000? Give me an example of a big mistake?

207
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,038
让人发现了就叫大错
Letting people find out about it

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,072
放电线的棚子干吗开暖气?
Why are we heating sheds full of wire?

209
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,232
您要听真话?     要是不麻烦的话
You want the truth? Lf it's no trouble.

210
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,188
员工利用这个棚养蘑菇
The staff are using the sheds forgrowing mushrooms.

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,599
禁止掉
Stop them

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,158
他们从1945年就这么做了
They've been doing it since 1945.

213
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,312
养蘑菇是这份无聊工作的唯一消遣
It's the only perk in an extremely boring job.

214
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,631
罗德的文具采购提案为什么不理?
What about Rhodes's proposals forstationery?

215
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,715
他是个麻烦精 变态地迷恋效率
A trouble-makerand crank unhealthily obsessed with efficiency.

216
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,077
为什么不采纳他的提案? 能省几百万呢
Why didn'twe adopt his proposals and save millions?

217
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,994
对 但要做很多前期工作     所以呢?
Yes, but a lot of work to implement. So?

218
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,879
需要更多员工     汉弗莱
Taking on more staff. Humphrey

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,474
提出反证?     我哪来反证
Disprove it. I can't, obviously.

220
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,710
可不是     你编的?
Exactly Making it up?

221
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,030
当然     为什么?
Of course. Why?

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,591
演示如何对付特委会
As an example ofhow to handle a select committee.

223
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,476
这些都很好 汉弗莱爵士 谈细节吧
Sir Humphrey, let's get down to details.

224
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,791
比如那个开暖气的飞机棚     没错
This heated aircraft hangar. Indeed.

225
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,030
我明白委员会的顾虑
I do understand yourconcern,

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,636
但是你看 赫里福郡冬天极其寒冷
but it gets frightfully cold in Herefordshire.

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,190
即使公务员...     那里头不是公务员
Even civil servants... We aren't talking about civil servants.

228
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,751
是一大堆铜线 有塑胶皮保暖
We're talking coils of wire plastic-coated to keep them warm

229
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,791
总有员工进进出出     为什么?
Staff are in and out all the time. Why?

230
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,034
提货 退货 盘货
Taking deliveries, making withdrawals, checking records,

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,918
防火检查...
fire inspections...

232
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,074
他们可以戴手套吧?     但这是员工福利政策
They can weargloves? But it's a staff welfare policy.

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,838
这项政策花了纳税人几百万磅
I suggest this policy is costing the taxpayermillions

234
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,791
没话说了 汉弗莱爵士?
Nothing to say?

235
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,110
我无权评论国家政策 去问大臣
I can't comment on Government policy.

236
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,991
但你为大臣提建议
But you advise the Minister.

237
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,991
主席当然理解 我不能泄漏我的建议
I can't disclose how I advise him.

238
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,110
大臣对政策负责     好 我们会问大臣
The Minister's responsible forpolicy. We'll ask the Minister.

239
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,428
文具的事怎么说呢?
What about stationery savings?

240
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,798
那会使基层职员掌握大笔公款
Itwould've meant Government patronage on junior staff.

241
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,951
大笔公款?
"Considerable Government patronage"?

242
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,873
一包回形针的钱?
Buying a packet of paperclips?

243
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,919
国家政策要求对公款使用人数
It's Government policy to exercise strict control

244
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,514
实施严格控制 相信您也理解
overwho can spend its money.

245
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,559
谁要用回形针 谁自己去买 这是常理
It's common sense to let people buy theirown paperclips.

246
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,190
政府政策和常理无关
Government policy is nothing to do with common sense.

247
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,435
你不觉得政策应该改改吗?
Don't you think it's time the policy was changed?

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,953
嗯 汉弗莱爵士?
Well, Sir Humphrey?

249
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,430
我无权评论国家政策 问大臣吧
I can't comment on Government policy. Ask the Minister.

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,989
大臣建议我们问你
The Ministeradvises us to ask you.

251
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,799
我建议你们问大臣
I'm advising you to ask the Minister.

252
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,872
要绕到几时啊?     你说完事就完事
When does this end? As soon as you like.

253
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,675
好 说说屋顶花园吧
Let's come to the roof garden.

254
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,831
好 很荣幸
Yes, with pleasure.

255
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,190
它隶属于一系列屋顶隔热装置
This was part of a wide variety of roof insulation schemes,

256
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,638
这是政府的节能实验
which the Governmentwas testing in fuel economy.

257
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,360
花了75000磅
But ?5,000

258
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,071
本打算用卖花卉蔬菜的钱抵销成本的
Itwas thought the sale of vegetable might offset the cost.

259
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,832
结果呢?
And did it?

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,470
不能抵消     那干吗还留着它?
No. Then why not abandon the garden?

261
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,111
造也造好了 正好隔热用 下不为例
It's there now insulating the roof. we aren't building any more

262
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,599
但已经浪费了75000磅
But you've wasted ?5,000

263
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,036
政策要求尝试一切节能手段啊
All proposals were tested forfuel saving.

264
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,717
这样浪费纳税人的钱也在所不惜?
At this fantastic waste of taxpayers' money?

265
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,598
你同意这是浪费吧?
You agree itwas wasted?

266
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,036
我无权评论国家政策 去问大臣
I can't comment on Government policy. Ask the Minister.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,558
汉弗莱爵士 我们问大臣什么
Look, whateverwe ask the Minister,

268
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:44,558
他都说是行政问题 归你管
he says is a question foryou.

269
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,793
我们问你 你又说是政策问题 问大臣
Whateverwe ask you, you say is a question forthe Minister

270
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,838
这叫我们怎么调查?
How do we find out what's going on?

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
对对 我能理解你们的难处
Yes, I see there is a dilemma here.

272
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,796
就是说 尽管政府认为大臣负责政策
Government regards policy as the responsibility of Ministers

273
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,952
部属负责行政
and administration as the responsibility of officials,

274
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,793
可一旦涉及行政政策 就会混淆
questions of administrative policy cause confusion

275
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,795
行政的政策制定和政策的行政执行
between policy of administration and administration of policy

276
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,317
尤其在归责问题上 行政的政策制定
especially when responsibility forthe policy of administration

277
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,190
与政策的行政执行产生了矛盾
conflicts with the policy of administration of policy.

278
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,271
这些都是胡扯
That's a load of meaningless drivel.

279
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,158
对吧?
Isn't it?

280
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,238
我无权评论国家政策 去问大臣
I can't comment on Government policy. Ask the Minister.

281
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,000
多亏你了 汉弗莱
A great help

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,718
别客气 大臣 我尽力而为嘛
I did my best.

283
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,795
尽力保你自己吧 你说了等于没说
Best foryourself, perhaps But youranswers solved nothing.

284
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,875
别忘了 后天我们要同时出席第三次质询
We'll both be there getting the third degree from the committee

285
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,873
得说得过去才行 口径一致
We've got to have the same answers

286
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,271
来确定一下立场吧     好 事实是什么?
Let's establish ourposition. What are the facts?

287
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,034
我在说立场 跟事实无关
The facts are neitherhere northere

288
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,472
好吧 立场是什么?
I see. What's ourposition?

289
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,519
我们有五个标准理由
We choose one of the five standard excuses

290
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,558
每个应付一项指责 最好不重样
to deal with each allegation.

291
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,188
五个标准理由?      对
Five standard excuses?

292
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,638
第一个理由曾在剑桥间谍案中使用过
First, the excuse we used in the Anthony Blunt case:

293
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,633
"这些事都有合理解释"
"There's an explanation foreverything,

294
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,792
"但出于安全考虑 不能公开"
but security forbids its disclosure".

295
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,795
第二个理由曾在综合中学辩论中使用过
Second, the excuse we used forcomprehensive schools:

296
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,598
"由于降低了预算"
"Because ofbudget cuts,

297
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,150
"监管力量削弱才有了这一疏忽"
supervisory resources went beyond their limits".

298
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,869
不是真的吧?     但这个借口很好用
That's not true, is it? But it's a good excuse.

299
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,156
第三个曾在协和飞机事件中使用过
Then there's the excuse forConcorde:

300
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,675
"该实验值得一做 并且已经停止"
"Aworthwhile experiment, now abandoned,

301
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,675
"得到了大量珍贵数据 还提供了就业"
but it had provided much valuable data and employment".

302
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,798
这是真的吧?
But that is true, isn't it?

303
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,076
哦 当然不是
Oh, no, of course it isn't.

304
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,719
第四个 慕尼黑协议的理由
Four, there's the excuse forthe Munich Agreement:

305
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,713
"有些重要信息 定局之后我们才得知"
"It occurred before important facts were known

306
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,359
"下不为例"
and couldn't re-occur".

307
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,158
什么重要信息?
What important facts?

308
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,630
希特勒其实想征服欧洲
That Hitlerwanted to conquer Europe.

309
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,039
这谁不知道     外交部的人不知道
I thought everybody knew that Not the Foreign Office.

310
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,071
第五呢?     第五
Five? Five...

311
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,834
克里米亚轻骑兵溃败的理由
The Charge of the Light Brigade excuse:

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,275
"由个人决策失误引起"
"An unfortunate lapse by an individual,

313
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,194
"已根据内部纪律条例予以处理"
dealtwith under internal disciplinary procedures".

314
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,635
就这几条 都能搞定?     走运的话 基本没问题
That covers everything? Just about, so far.

315
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
连战争也行?     小型战争吧
Even wars? Small wars.

316
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,513
从现在起我们要紧密合作     合则强 不合则亡
It's teamwork from now on. United we stand, divided we fall

317
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,035
大臣 您10分钟内得到下院
Minister, you're due at the House.

318
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,558
首相顾问斯宾塞爵士请您今天去喝一杯
PM's adviserwants you to pop in fora drink. Sir Mark Spencer.

319
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,476
斯宾塞?     我提议5点半
Mark Spencer? I suggested 5.30?

320
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,950
好 天啊 我就知道有麻烦
Fine, yes. Oh, dear. I knew there'd be trouble.

321
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,272
首相要问 为什么我们对质询回答不力
The PM wants to knowwhy ourreplies have been so feeble.

322
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,954
也可能就是喝一杯 大臣
Perhaps it's just fora drink.

323
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,033
别傻了 10号里喝一杯从来不是解渴用的
They don't ask you fora drink just because you're thirsty

324
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,196
6点半我们再碰头 编个故事出来
I'll meet you back here at 6.30, and we'll cook up a story.

325
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,033
是确定立场 大臣     我就这个意思
Agree ourposition, Minister. That's what I said.

326
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,913
请进
Come in

327
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,079
你好 吉姆
Hello, Jim.

328
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,835
威士忌?     好的 谢谢
Scotch? Thanks.

329
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,393
你情况怎样?     还可以
How are things going? Fine.

330
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,350
说到特委会 那本书确实始料未及
That select committee was a shock, throwing the book at us,

331
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,435
但一切还在掌握中 我和汉弗莱会给出说法的
but everything's undercontrol. Humphrey and I can explain it.

332
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,397
首相不必担心
The PM shouldn'tworry.

333
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,554
真不知道罗德从哪得到这么多内幕
I'd like to knowwhere Malcolm Rhodes got all his information.

334
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,029
也不知道书稿又怎么到了欧汉手里
And who gave the proofs to Betty Oldham?

335
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,952
首相肯定气坏了
The PM must be livid.

336
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,270
不过这可不能怪我
It's no fault of mine.

337
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,115
为什么你觉得首相会生气?     肯定的嘛
Why do you think the PM's livid? Surely?

338
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,353
我们用常理分析一下吧 吉姆 坐下
Let's look at the situation logically. Sit down.

339
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,953
当然
Yes. Of course.

340
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,148
我先问你几件事
Let me ask you some questions.

341
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,674
在公共支出方面 首相有何意图?
What is the PM trying to achieve in public expenditure?

342
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,355
当然要削减     为什么成果不彰呢?
Cuts, obviously. Why so little success?

343
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,514
公务员不配合?     所有大臣都想削减支出吗?
Obstruction from the service? All the Cabinet committed to it?

344
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,708
是吧 至少我是     没错 但谁都削不下来
I think so. I certainly am. But no Minister's made any cuts.

345
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,711
循序渐进 不能心急嘛     不对
Rome wasn't built in a day. No.

346
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,952
问题在于 大臣都被驯服了
It's because all the Ministers have gone native.

347
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,590
不是吧?     公务员调教了他们
Surely? The civil service has trained them

348
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,957
也许有一两个吧 不过我可没有
Well, maybe true... Certainly not of me

349
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,829
如果一名大臣真想削减支出
If a Ministerwere really trying to cut expenditure,

350
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,471
他对一本揭露政府浪费的书 会作何反应?
howwould he react to a book exposing Governmentwaste?

351
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,710
我觉得他会...      嗯?
I should think he'd... Mmm?

352
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,880
这个要看...
Itwould depend...

353
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,910
你到底想说什么?
What are you trying to say?

354
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,676
知道公务员怎么说你吗? 他们说与你合作愉快
Knowwhat the civil service say? You're a pleasure to work with.

355
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,159
噢
Oh

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,278
噢...
Oh...

357
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,989
驯兽师屋豪就是这么说她的哈巴狗的
That's what Barbara Woodhouse says about herspaniels.

358
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,829
汉弗莱爵士甚至说你是无价之宝
Sir Humphrey said you're worth yourweight in gold.

359
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,355
你觉得这怎么讲?
What does that suggest to you?

360
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,318
是说我彻底失败了?
That I've failed utterly?

361
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,995
你还得来杯威士忌
You look as if you need anotherScotch.

362
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,991
首相不高兴
The PM isn't pleased

363
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,675
是因为我在特委会面前
with my performance at the committee.

364
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,913
没能掩盖我们的失误     恰恰相反
I failed to coverup the failure. On the contrary.

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,356
他不满意你掩盖得太成功了
He's not pleased because you're covering up too well.

366
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,399
你没发现吗? 你在掩护公务员 掩护汉弗莱
Don't you see? You're protecting the civil service.

367
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,358
首相和我千方百计
The PM and I are doing ourbest

368
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,196
揭露无法削减支出的原因
to expose why cuts in expenditure are not taking place.

369
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,558
你在帮公务员对抗政府
And you are helping the civil service to defy the Government.

370
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,029
我有吗?
Am I?

371
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,192
你想不通欧汉哪来的书稿
You were wondering where Betty Oldham got the proofs

372
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,796
罗德哪来的内幕消息
and where Malcolm Rhodes got that inside information.

373
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,511
猜猜看?
Can't you guess?

374
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,919
你是说...首相?
You mean... the PM?

375
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,718
当然不是
Of course not

376
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,559
不是直接的
Not directly.

377
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,957
你?
You mean... you?

378
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,951
到底要我跟特委会说什么?
What am I to do at the select committee?

379
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,113
你现在只有一条路可走 绝对忠诚
There's only one course open to you. Absolute loyalty.

380
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,719
忠于谁?
Who to?

381
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,828
这就看你了
That's yourdecision.

382
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,275
我们得知某些重要事实之前 大错已经铸成
Itwas an errorthat occurred before important facts were known.

383
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,877
我保证 这种疏忽下不为例
It is an oversight that couldn't possibly happen again.

384
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,635
大臣 您说是吧?     汉弗莱爵士完全正确
Wouldn't you agree, Minister? Perfectly correct.

385
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,076
官方回答正是这样
The correct official reply.

386
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,268
但我几天来一直在深思
But I've been thinking very deeply overthe last few days,

387
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,797
毫无疑问 特委会说到了点子上
and there's no doubt that this committee is on to something.

388
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,758
浪费当然存在
Of course there's waste.

389
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,996
这些案例各有各的借口
And excuses can always be found in individual cases.

390
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,357
但经你们一说 我认识到我们错了
But you have convinced me ourapproach is wrong.

391
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,275
大臣及其公务员老是在掩盖问题 互相辩解
Ministers and theircivil servants so often coverup and defend

392
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,512
其实发现和消灭问题才是正途
where they should seek out and destroy.

393
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,555
我和罗德先生 这本宝贵的书的作者谈过
I've spoken to Mr Rhodes, authorof this invaluable book,

394
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,518
他同意主持一次独立调查
and he'll head an independent enquiry

395
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,071
研究政府执政问题 首先从我部开刀
into the field of administration, starting with my department.

396
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,596
汉弗莱爵士有何反应?
And how does Sir Humphrey react to this?

397
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,229
汉弗莱爵士与我同心同德
Sir Humphrey is in complete agreementwith me.

398
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,394
分工合作 是吧汉弗莱 我得说 我和他合作愉快
We work as a team. I must say, he's a pleasure to work with.

399
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,831
可是大臣 揭露出的事
But this account of what's been going on

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,949
和你在华盛顿说的"严厉打击浪费"互相矛盾啊
doesn't square with your speech about a waron waste.

401
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,557
我是个老派的人 贝蒂
Well, I'm an old-fashioned sort of chap, Betty,

402
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,478
我信仰一种叫做"忠诚"的东西
and I believe in a thing called loyalty.

403
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,590
内部矛盾内部解决 不可外扬 对吧 汉弗莱?
Whateveryou say in private you defend in public, eh, Humphrey?

404
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,911
这样的话 你现在不就不忠诚了吗?
In that case, aren't you being disloyal now?

405
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,636
非也 我认为大臣的忠诚水准更高
No. I believe a Minister has a higher loyalty.

406
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,473
效忠国会 效忠国家
A loyalty to Parliament and the nation.

407
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,675
为这种高于一切的忠诚
And that loyalty must be paramount,

408
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,434
他必须披荆斩棘 一往无前
howeverhard and painful that may be.

409
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,115
我当然要忠于我的部门和部属
Of course, one is loyal to one's department and officials,

410
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,831
只要证据允许 但我要公开表明我的一贯态度
until the evidence is overwhelming, but I must say in public,

411
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,072
改革可行 并即将进行
that reforms can and will take place,

412
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,439
相信汉弗莱爵士必将成为我忠诚的战友
and I know I shall find in Sir Humphrey my staunchest ally.

413
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,830
对吧 汉弗莱?
Isn't that so, Humphrey?

414
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,319
是的 大臣
Yes, Minister.

415
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,399
是的 大臣
Yes, Minister.

416
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,233
多亏您了 大臣     我尽力而为
A big help I did my best.

417
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,279
尽力保您自己吧 这就是您的"团结"? 可笑
The best foryourself This is your idea of teamwork? Amusing

418
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,829
我必须这么做     必须怎么做?
I had to do it. Had to do what?

419
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,479
主动向特委会检讨一切?
Cravenly admit everything to them?

420
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,712
您不知道我们要遭殃了吗?
Don't you realise how calamitous this is forus?

421
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,429
不会都遭殃吧 我希望      没希望的 大臣
Not both of us, I hope. You hope in vain.

422
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,070
部员们全副武装 没人还信任您
We're up in arms, with very little confidence in you.
