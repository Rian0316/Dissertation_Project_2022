   so we can figure out a way,  
             right?             

120
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,557
   Cut the number

             instead of actors? 

125
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:59,900
   Or if we did it              
all in one location?            

126
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,644

            no scope, no impact.

1151
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:59,118
 What didn't you get            
  that you wanted?              

1152
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,646
             I don't trust you. 

1153
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,064
        Why?                    

1154
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,818
               You played me.   

1155
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,155
       You made me the sucker...
                   again.       

1156
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:11,731
   Again? What --               

1157
00:49:11,733 --> 00:49:13,974
Wait. How can you be the sucker?
  It was your plan.             

1158
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,219
            Oh, fuck you, Jimmy.

1159
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,553
                    God.        

1160
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,739
                    I --        
             Uh, you know what? 

1161
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:22,074
                   I can't      
              do this anymore.  

1162
00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:24,318
                    Kim,        
                I was just --   

1163
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,321
No, you -- you turned           
you and me versus the bank      

1164
00:49:27,323 --> 00:49:28,915
 into you versus me.            

1165
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:31,234
    And it is not               
     just this.                 

1166
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:33,327
 It's the same thing            
over and over again.            

1167
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:36,239
      No, I kept things from you
               to protect you.  

1168
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:39,091
    Look, if I got caught and --
                God forbid --   

1169
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:40,927
              you're questioned 
                 under oath,    

1170
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:42,854
                  you have      
          plausible deniability.

1171
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:44,247
    Jesus, Jimmy.               

1172
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:46,340
   You can excuse               
stabbing me in the back         

1173
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:48,100
 by making it about             
   protecting me?               

1174
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,770
Is that -- Is that really       
supposed to justify everything? 

1175
00:49:50,772 --> 00:49:52,104
           Okay, Kim, I'm sorry.

1176
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:54,014
 [Scoffs]                       
            I'm sorry, alright? 

1177
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:56,183
             It -- It will never
                happen again.   

1178
00:49:56,185 --> 00:49:57,610
    That's a lie.               

1179
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,446
               Well, I swear.   
              I swear it won't. 

1180
00:50:00,448 --> 00:50:02,356
 Look me in the eye             

1181
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:05,210
     and tell me                
it'll never happen again.       

1182
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:07,879
             [Breathing sharply]

1183
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:09,797
     You can't.                 

1184
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,033
I don't believe you.            

1185
00:50:13,035 --> 00:50:16,054
      You don't                 
  believe yourself.             

1186
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,613
    It is a lie.                

1187
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,283
      You lie.                  
       I lie.                   

1188
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,618
  This has to end.              

1189
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,396
   I-I-I cannot                 
 keep living like this.         
                        No, no. 

1190
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,789
                 No, no, Kim,   
               we can fix this. 
 Jimmy, no, shut up.            

1191
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,067
    Jimmy, Jimmy,               
you know this has to change.    

1192
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,069
If you don't see it,            
I don't know what to say        

1193
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,737
  because we are at             
  a breaking point.             

1194
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,631
                      Oh, God!  
Either we end this now --       

1195
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:36,299
                            No! 
Either we end this now          

1196
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,150
and [Voice breaking]            
enjoy the time we had           

1197
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:40,987
and go our separate ways,       
     or we're...                

1198
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:44,156
              [Exhales sharply] 
                  Or what?      

1199
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:47,252
     Or we're --                
 we're -- I mean...             

1200
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:48,920
  [Inhales deeply]              

1201
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:51,422
     Or maybe...                

1202
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,681
Maybe we get married.
