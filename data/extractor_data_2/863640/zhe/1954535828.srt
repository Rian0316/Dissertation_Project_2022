1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,070
Ted:我们说到哪了?
Ted:Okay where were we?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,210
那是2006年的七月, 我们的生活刚发生了意想不到的变化
It was June of 2006,and life had just taken an unexpected turn

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,200
爸, 你就不能把开头省了 直接说你是怎么遇见妈妈的吗?
Dad,Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,910
我觉得你已经说了有一年了
I feel like you've been talking for like a year

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,260
宝贝, 我告诉你的这些都是很重要的
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
这些都是故事的组成部分
It's all part of the story.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,960
我能去下厕所吗?
Could I go to the bathroom??

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,330
不行
No.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,320
2006年的夏天既美妙又糟糕
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,020
对我来说 开始是很不错的
For me, it started out great

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,190
事实上, 第一天简直棒极了
In fact, day one was amazing.

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,890
我终于和Robin在一起了
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,610
然而, 当我正在享受一生中最开心的一天时
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,970
你们的marshall叔叔却度过了最悲伤的一天
your uncle marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,150
marshall: 那就这样了?
marshall: So that's it?

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,800
我们分手?
We're breaking up?

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,030
Marshall, 对不起
Marshall,I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,010
我只是...
I just...

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,720
我只是要去旧金山做这个艺术项目 脱离这个小圈子想一想我到底是怎样的人
I just need to go to san francisco and do this art program and-and figure out who I am outside of us.

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,120
能达成这个目的的唯一方法就是...
And the only way that I can do that is if...

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,890
我们这段时间不要联系了
if we don't talk for a while.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,760
这段时间
For a while.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,990
倒不如永远别联系, 好吗?
Try never,okay?

24
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,860
如果你从这个门走出去 我们就完了
You walk out that door,and we're done.

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,640
你再也不会听见我的声音
You're never going to hear my voice again.

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,930
我应该打给她
I should call her.

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,350
- 不 - 是
No,no. Ted it is--

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,120
如果她叫你别打给她你还打 那只会示弱, 你会后悔的
if you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,490
现在, 听着 如果你觉得想找她，就先来找我
Now,listen,whenever you feel like calling her,you come find me first.

30
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,260
我会给你脸上来一拳的
And I will punch you in the face.

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,390
你是个好朋友, ted
You're a good friend,ted.

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,560
你听说大新闻了吗?
So,did you hear the big news?

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,670
你是说lily和marshall分手这件事
You mean how lily and marshall broke up,

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,910
而且lily走了, 昨晚没有比这件更大的事了 我想他已经知道了
and lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night,yeah,I think he knows.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,520
哦, 天
Oh,my god.

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,870
我很遗憾
I-I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,820
怎么回事?
Wh-- what happened?

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,800
恩, 她离开了
Well,she left.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,610
而我都不知道她会不会回来
And I don't even know if she's coming back.

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,740
我醒了才听到留言
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,030
老兄, 我很遗憾 多谢
Bro,I am so sorry. Thanks.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,860
我知道这很难受
I know it must be tough,

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,200
但是你准备好听一些不仅能让你振作起来 而且还能让你兴奋的东西了吗?
but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better,but will actively excite you?

44
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,560
当然
Sure.

45
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,890
有史以来第一次, 我们三个人都是单身了
For the first time,ever,the three of us are single at the same time.

46
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,590
我梦想着有这么一天 这将成为一个传奇
I've dreamed about this day,boys,and it's going to be legendary.

47
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,570
我们一起, 将会得到这个城市
Together,we will own this city.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,500
当女生们想要报复她们前任男友时 我们就会出现
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,we'll be there.

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:28,200
当女生们想要理清他父亲的问题, 想痛饮时 我们就会出现
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking,we will be there.

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,870
当一个单身舞会举行的时候
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo,

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,350
当她们把头伸出天窗外叫 "纽约, 这是怎么了?"的时候
sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,"What's up,new york?

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,330
我们就是纽约的精髓所在
" We will be what is up new york.

53
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,820
绅士们, 我们将要着手于...
Gentlemen,we are about to embark on...

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,050
哦, 伙计们, 你们俩搞上了 对吧?
aw,man,you guys did it,didn't you?

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,590
这个夏天我学到了一样东西 那就是爱情开始的时候
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning...

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,650
以及结束的时候, 头30天是惊人的相似
and love is ending,the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

59
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,320
比如, 你花了大部分时间在床上
For one thing,you spend most of your time in bed.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,290
你的朋友没法忍受听你说话
your friends can't stand to listen to you.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,440
他真是难搞
He's so ticklish.

62
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,810
真是一首好歌
It was a really beautiful song.

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,390
所以...
So...

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,180
真笨
stupid,man.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,860
而且你似乎总是不穿裤子
and you never seem to wear pants.

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,770
嘿,marshall.
hey,marshall.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,310
嘿, Ted
Hey,ted.

68
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,440
饿了吗?
You hungry?

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,200
你想说什么? 我的确想吃点什么
What's the point?I could eat some food.

70
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,590
他们就快离开我了
It's just going to leave me.

71
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,000
好吧, 至少在这个情境下,是你把食物给拉出来的(双关语dump,甩,窝屎)
Well,at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,570
快点, 今天是周日 应该吃点煎饼
Come on,it's sunday.It's pancakes day.

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,020
Lily以前总是做煎饼吃
Lily always made the pancakes.

74
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,340
上帝啊, 我爱吃她的煎饼
God,I loved her pancakes.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,870
软软的
So soft.

76
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,320
热乎乎的
So warm.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
样子还很好看
So perfectly shaped.

78
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,040
我们是不是还在讨论她的煎饼?
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,520
拜托, 你必须得吃点东西 想要我给你带什么?
Come on,you got to eat something; what can I get you?

80
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,300
啤酒
Beer.

81
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,380
不行, 你昨晚晚餐就是喝这个
No,that's what you had for dinner.

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,680
行
Fine.

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,340
那我就喝剩下的
Then I'll just have leftovers.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,570
Barney: 那么他呆在家里一直都不睡觉?
Barney: So,he stays home all the time not getting laid?

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
看到了吧, 和你有了未婚妻一个样
No,see,that's what you do when you have a fiance.

86
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,210
他应该也来这了庆祝一下
He should be down here celebrating.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,610
他反正有空
He's free.

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,830
他刚把红头瘤给切了
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,750
你应该写儿童读物
You should write and illustrate children's books.

90
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,470
你们知道Marshall最该做什么吗?
You know what marshall needs to do.

91
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,330
他应该停止悲伤
He needs to stop being sad.

92
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,870
我伤心的时候不会表现出伤心 相反我会表现的很出众
When I get sad,I stop being sad and be awesome instead.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
的确是这样的
True story.

94
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,730
这才1个月
It's only been a month.

95
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,230
他有自己处理事情的节奏
He just needs to go at his own pace.

96
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,520
话又说回来, Lily是这些麻烦的始作俑者
Anyway,lily's the one who caused this whole mess.

97
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,930
嘿, 放过她吧 她也是我们的朋友
Hey,cut her some slack.She's our friend,too.

98
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,900
她只是想证明她是谁
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

99
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,180
证明她是谁?
Figure out who she is?

100
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,130
是的, 那她应该打电话给我 我有一整张列表
Yeah,she should call me; I got a whole list.

101
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,160
她自私
She's selfish.

102
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,170
她不成熟
She's immature.

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,760
她...
She'S...

104
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,080
什么?
What?

105
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,810
上帝啊, 你的眼睛好蓝
God,your eyes are so blue.

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,570
哇哦, 泰迪熊
Aw,teddy bear.

107
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,840
哦那真是...
oh that's A...

108
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,380
是的，想伤心也伤心不起来
yeah,it was hard to feel too bad.

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,030
我和我梦寐以求的女孩交往了 一切都是这么完美
I was dating the woman of my dreams,and things were going great.

110
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,280
好吧, 大部分的时候是这样的
Well,for the most part.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,450
我找到了她的洗发水
So,I found her shampoo.

112
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,280
我想是她忘记带走了
I guess she left it here.

113
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,230
闻上去有她的味道
It smells like her.

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,990
像熏衣草的, 贝壳的还有希望的味道
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

115
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,690
不知为何, 性欲和舒适同时存在
Somehow,erotic and comforting all at the same time.

116
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,370
那是我的洗发水
That's my shampoo.

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,510
哦抱歉
Oh,sorry.

118
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,440
嗯, 我想他永远都不会睡觉的
Mmm,I thought he'd never go to sleep.

119
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,470
已经完了?
Already?

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,090
他在打电话给她
He's calling her.

121
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,280
- 我什么都没听到 - 他在打电话给她
I don't hear any-- he's calling her.

122
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,260
不
No.

123
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,440
好吧, 你是对的, 我不能打电话给她
Okay,you're right,I won't call her.

124
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,850
我不会打电话给她的
I will not call her.

125
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,010
好吧, 我打了
Well,I called her.

126
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,400
而我得到的是, 她换号码了
And get this,she changed her number.

127
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,410
就像我会缠着她不放似的
What,like I'm going to stalk her,or something?

128
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,310
她以为她很特别
Like she's so special.

129
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,450
就像只有她一个人叫Lily Aldrin
Like she's the only lily aldrin out there.

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,290
因为光在旧金山就有4个人叫这个名字
'Cause there are four others in the san francisco area alone,

131
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,210
根据我和他们的简短对话来看 任何一个都要比她强
and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,670
他知道我在里面吗?
Does he know I'm in here?

133
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,120
是的, 嘿, Robin
Yeah,hey,robin.

134
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,740
话说回来, 其中一个Lily Aldrin说...
Anyways,one of the lily aldrins said...

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
这必须停下来
this has to stop.

136
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,930
Ted, 我们才刚开始交往
Ted,we just started dating.

137
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,900
我们同意进展不要太快 而现在我们有了孩子
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,and yet somehow,we have a baby.

138
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,440
他不能自己养活自己
He can't feed himself.

139
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,600
他没日没夜的哭 让我们也没法睡觉
He cries a lot,he keeps us up all night.

140
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,280
你考虑过母乳喂养了吗?
Have you tried breast-feeding?

141
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,870
就是这样的!
Nailed it!

142
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,300
听着, 他们在一起9年了
Look,they were together nine years.

143
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,100
现在才1个半月
It's only been a month and a half.

144
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,900
他只是需要用自己的节奏走出来
He just needs to go at his own pace.

145
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,310
他昨晚睡在我们房间的地板上了, Ted
He slept on our floor last night,ted.

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,070
他只是看了一部恐怖片而已
He watched a scary movie.

147
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,350
是该严厉的爱了
It is time for some tough love.

148
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,220
我们需要让他走出那个公寓
We need to get him out of that apartment.

149
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,530
呼吸一点新鲜空气
He needs fresh air.

150
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,790
他需要阳光
He needs sunshine.

151
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,580
嗯, 阳光
Mmm,sunshine.

152
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,300
现在让我们热烈欢迎, Sunshine
Please welcome to the stage,sunshine.

153
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,400
好吧, 我不认为这对我有什么好处
All right,I really don't think this is going to help.

154
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,780
你知道你为什么还没有忘记Lily吗?
Do you know why you're not over lily yet?

155
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,910
因为你还能记起她赤裸的样子
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.

156
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,470
当你忘记她的乳房的时候, 你就忘记了那个女的 这是科学真理
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs; it's a scientific fact.

157
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,060
平均每个男人脑子里只能储存一定量的乳房影像
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

158
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,060
{\an8}图片的格式是Jpeg,此处Barney自由发挥B(oob)-peg

159
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,040
而你的脑子里现在全部都是Lily的
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with lily'S.

160
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,820
有很多
There are a lot of them.

161
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,870
除非你重新输入别的女人的图片 不然它们永远都在那里, 不会消失的
Well,they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.

162
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,260
这次旅程也许会有成千上万的乳房让你看 我们今晚就从这里开始, 朋友
Now,this journey may take as many as a million boobs,so we begin here tonight,my friend.

163
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,930
2个一次
Two at a time.

164
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,310
这些可以算是4个
Those count as four.

165
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,290
很有趣, 是吗?
This is fun right?

166
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,430
我们在户外, 天气很好
We're outside,it's a beautiful day.

167
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,810
Indians要赢了
The indians are winning.

168
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,400
我不得不承认, 呆在户外的确好受多了
I got to admit,it is really nice to be outside.

169
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,750
朋友们, 请将你们的注意放到这个 非同寻常的戒指身上吧
Yankee fans,please turn your attention to the diamond vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.

170
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,120
哦不
Oh,no.

171
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,230
这是一个大谎言
it's all a big lie!

172
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,210
她会让你伤透心的
She's just going to break your heart.

173
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,780
你能把我从这里拖出去 但是她是一个没有灵魂的空壳
you can drag me out of here,but she has no soul!

174
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,530
我们什么都试过了, 棒球, 脱衣舞女
We've tried everything-- baseball,strippers.

175
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,610
那个家伙还是不买一点帐
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

176
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,200
我觉得他已经没希望了
I think he's beyond repair.

177
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,050
看, 这就是你们男人的通病
See,this is the problem with guys.

178
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,770
你们根本不知道怎么处理心碎的问题
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,470
哦, 那你的处方是什么, Estrogen医生
Oh,and what's your prescription,dr.Estrogen?

180
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,240
享受哈根达斯, 看爱情片 直到和你的周期同步?
Eat haagen-dazs and watch love actually,till your periods sync uP.

181
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,760
对了, 就是这样
yeah,that's the stuff.

182
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,120
哦上帝啊
Oh,my god.

183
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,800
你玩这个多长时间了?
How long have you been doing this?

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,980
当我还是孩子的时候我父亲就教我射击
Well,my dad taught me to me shoot when I was a kid.

185
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,680
当我孤单或者压抑的时候 我都到这里来, 提醒我自己...
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed,I come here,and it reminds me that...

186
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,530
枪是很好玩的
guns are fun.

187
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,480
你知道, Ted一直对枪很反感
um,you know,ted is kind of against guns.

188
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,630
所以Ted永远也不能知道我在玩这个
And that's why ted's never going to find out about this.

189
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,980
哇哦, 我拿枪是不是有点威胁你的意思?
Whoa,that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun,didn't it?

190
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,920
不, 我是说, 别把这事告诉Ted
No,I-I just mean,please don't tell ted.

191
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,770
你想试试看吗?
You want to try?

192
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,060
当然
Only hell yeah.

193
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,170
哦是的, 这就是我想要的
Oh,yeah,yeah,this is what I needed.

194
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,290
一直来我都感觉很无力 但是这个...
I felt so powerless this whole time,but this...

195
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,950
太有力了
this is power.

196
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,410
这真是...
This is...

197
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,930
我应该提醒你有很大的后座力
I should of mentioned the recoil.

198
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,260
我得告诉你, 我回家的时候 他居然在笑, 你是不是和他上床了?
I got to hand it to you,when he got home,marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?

199
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
因为我好像已经有3天没有提出这个要求了
'Cause I was actually,like,three days away from suggesting that.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,560
有时候, 你们需要做的就是接触他阴柔的一面
Sometimes,all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.

201
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,250
太好了!
yeah,yeah!

202
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,550
好吧, 恭喜你
Well,congratulations.

203
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,740
你是这整个夏天里唯一能让他开心的人
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.

204
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,300
- 你赢了 - 哦, 那我能得到什么?
You win. Oh,what do I win?

205
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,720
让我告诉你会赢得什么: 这个周末我会带你出去
I'll tell you what you win: I'm taking you away this weekend.

206
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,800
真的吗?
You are?

207
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,630
这真是太棒了
That's so nice.

208
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,280
是的, 我叔叔和阿姨在Montauk有一幢海滩别墅 那里真是太浪漫了
Yeah,my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in montauk,oh,it's really romantic.

209
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,550
我叔叔在那里好像有过3次浪漫史
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

210
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,680
哇哦, 肯定是幢不错的房子 我见过你叔叔的照片
Wow,must be a nice house,I've seen pictures of your uncle.

211
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,740
一切都会很完美的
This is going to be so great.

212
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,540
我们终于有时间可以独处一下了
We'll finally get some time alone.

213
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,020
不过你觉得Marshall会同意吗?
Are you sure marshall's going to be okay with this?

214
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,630
是的, 当然
Yeah,absolutely.

215
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,460
伙计, 我已经好多了
Dude,I'm doing much better.

216
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,120
事实上, 你可以开我的车去
In fact,take my car.

217
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,110
- 真的吗? - 是的
Really? Yeah.

218
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,080
嘿, 谢谢了...
Hey,thanks...

219
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,020
不管白天还是晚上, 如果需要什么就打电话过来 不过你知道吗, 请一定别打过来
and,hey,if you need anything day or night,just call me-- you know what,please don't call me.

220
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,540
什么? 怎么了?
What?What's wrong?

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,270
这是, 嗯, Lily的信用卡帐单
It's,uh,lily's credit card bill.

222
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,220
她肯定是忘记更换她的地址了
She must have forgotten to switch her address.

223
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,610
然后呢?
So?

224
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,510
然后我想知道她在旧金山都花了些什么钱
So,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in san francisco.

225
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,850
不不, 看这个一点好处都没有
No.No,no good can come from looking at this.

226
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,120
你好不容易才有这么点好转
You've made too much progress already.

227
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,670
- 我知道, 但是我只是想, 也许... - 绝不!
I know but I just,maybe the-- no!

228
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,230
你会因此感激我的
You're going to thank me for this.

You know,marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years,

244
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,430
但是我从来没有做过 因为我从来没有真正爱过他
but I didn't do it,because I never truly loved him.

245
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,830
我给你带了一个礼物
I got you a gift.

246
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,920
一个白鼬
A ferret.

247

哦, 我得去隔壁的宠物商店给他买点吃的
Oh,I'll buy it some food next door at the pet palace.

248
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,630
哦, 我一直很想要一只 但是Marshell一直有什么白鼬恐惧症
Oh,I've always wanted one,but marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.

249
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,710
我打赌他肯定让你发誓别告诉任何人
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.

250
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,650
的确是这样的
It was.

251

Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

255
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,930
这是我见过的最疯狂的事情
that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

256
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,610
是的, 你为什么害怕白鼬?
Yeah,why are you afraid of ferrets?

257

他们很可爱啊
They're adorable.

258
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,460
Robin, 因为他们就像毛茸茸的 和管子似的老鼠

还有, 这些消费似乎是一个月之前的
Plus,those charges are from,like,a month ago.

260
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,070
的确
Exactly.

261
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,290
要看新的记录 你必须去网上查看她的账户
For new charges,you have to go to her online account.

262
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,140
也许你们能看到2个小时前的信用卡使用记录
You can see credit card activity from,like,two hours ago.

263
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,410
但是, 你们知道, 还是别这么干
But,you know,don'T.

264
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,190
你干什么要说话?
Why do you talk?

265
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,000
你为什么要开口说话?!
Why do you talk?!

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,750
他需要输入她的密码 他应该不会有密码的吧
He needs her password.It's not like he has her password.

267
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,960
哦, 好吧, 他有她的密码
Ooh,this is good,he has her password.

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,170
Lily回到纽约了
Lily's back in new york.

271
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
我无法接受这个
I can't believe this.

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,780
Lily已经在纽约了?
Lily's in new york?

273
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,370
我以为她一回来就会打电话给我的
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back,she'd call me.

274
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,660
这是我这整个夏天都能这么坚强的唯一原因
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.

275
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,140
他整个夏天都很坚强?
This has been "holding it together"?

276

好吧, 我打电话给她
Okay,you know what?I'm calling her.

277
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,270
- 不行 - Ted, 把电话给我
No. Ted,give me the phone.

278
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,590
你不能打电话给她 这毫无用处
You're not calling her,this changes nothing.

279
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,420
你们, 给我过来
You,come here.

280
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,310
听着, 这个周末我们不在的时候 你要看好他, 保证他不给那个宾馆打电话
Look,while we're away this weekend,can you keep an eye on him,make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

281

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,260
哦好吧, 如果这次不免费 以后每次出去你就会看到
Uh,yeah,how about you do it for free or every time we hang out,you have to watch this?

286
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,180
过来
Come here.

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,090
我亲爱的蓝眼睛宝贝, 美丽的双唇 哦, 甜蜜啊....
My little blue-eyed baby,baby lips. Ooh,ooh,sugar,sugar...

288
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,280
好吧, 我不要钱了! 别再这么恶心了
okay,I'll do it!Stop being a couple.

289
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,140
Marshall.

290
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,310
Marshall, marshall! Marshall,marshall!

291
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,270
Ted, 我知道我不该这么做 但是我必须这样!
Ted,I know I shouldn't do this,but I have to!

292
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,540
- 你打电话给她... - 我们在一起已经9年了!
You call her we were together for nine years!

293
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,500
- 我们在一起经历了这么多事情... - 只会让事情更加...
And everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi...

294
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,970
你好, 请接Lily Aldrin的房间
hello,lily aldrin's room,please.

295
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,880
谢谢
Thank you.

296
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,510
- 现在就挂机 - Ted, 我现在不能挂
Hang up now. Ted,I can't hang up now.

297
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,680
离弦之箭, 我知道你不同意这样做
The missiles are in the air,and I know that you don't approve.

298
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,740
你好
Hello.

299
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,640
呃, 是一个男人接的电话
Uh,a guy answered.

300
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,310
有一个男人在她房间里面
There's-there's a guy in her room.

301
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,010
我亲自过去
I'm going down there.

302
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,810
伙计, 你不能这么做
Barney: Dude,you can't do that.

303
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,030
我必须过去, 我必须告诉她我爱她
Have to go down there,and I have to tell her I love her;

304
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,760
我会求她回心转意 如果需要的话我甚至可以下跪
I have to beg her to take me back,even if I have to get down on my knees.

305
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,060
Marshall, 你不能这么做
Marshall,you can't do that.

306
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,200
哦, 是吗? 为什么不能?
Oh,really,why not?

307
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,590
Ted: 第56天
Ted: 56 days.

308
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,220
我们花了这么长时间才有这点成果
That's how long it took me to get right about here.

309
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,690
因为你是个可怜虫
Because you're pathetic!

310
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,390
抱歉, 但是现在, 你不是真正的Marshell
I'm sorry,but right now,you are not marshall.

311
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,110
你是一个可悲的, 抱怨连天，喜欢闻洗发水 的Marshall的灵魂
You are the miserable,whining,shampoo-sniffing ghost of marshall,

312
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,760
老实说，Lily是不会给像你这样的男人 机会的
and frankly,a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like lily.

313
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,740
你知道谁有机会吗?
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line?

314
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,700
Marshall.

315
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,390
那个真正的Marshall
The real marshall.

316
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,480
但是如果你现在就过去，你就会坏了真正 的Marshall的事, 他永远都不会原谅你的
But if you go down there right now like this,you're going to blow it for him,and he's never going to forgive you.

317
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,250
当然, 不管我说什么, 你都选择背道而驰 好吧, 那就祝你有一个开心的周末
Of course,whatever I say,you're just going to do the opposite,so have a great weekend.

318
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,870
尽情糟蹋你自己的生活吧
Good luck screwing up your life.

319
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,230
快点, Robin
Come on,robin.

320
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,400
我们是不是还能借你的车用一下?
is it still okay if we borrow the car?

321
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,180
勇敢
Bold.

322
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,320
勇敢的用车吧
Bold to go for the car.

323
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,640
什么?
What?

324
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,850
我什么都没说
I didn't say a thing.

325
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,760
你觉得我刚才太过分了
You think I was too hard on him.

326
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
我可什么都没说
I didn't say a thing.

327
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,660
我不能相信你居然指责我对他太过分了
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.

328
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,000
是你说的"严厉的爱"
You're the one who said "tough love.

329
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,600
是的, "严厉的爱", 但是并不代表要给他讨绞索
" Yeah,tough love,not "hand the guy a noose.

330
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,250
哦, 给他把七毫米的枪就可以
" Oh,but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?

331
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,640
是的, 他告诉我的
Yeah,he told me.

332
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,980
那么你是一个枪痴吗?
So you're a gun nut?

333
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,970
不, 我是一个火枪爱好者
No,I'm a gun enthusiast.

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,980
- 你知道每年多少人被杀吗? - 至少保护我免收....
Do you know how many people are killed each year the second amendment protects my right to bear arms...

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,110
好吧好吧
all right,all right,all right.

336
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,400
我刚才是有点太过分了
I was too hard on him.

337
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,800
有那么一点
A little.

338
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,410
我打电话给Barney, 看看事态怎么样了
I'm going to call barney,see how they're doing.

339
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,040
我是Barney
go for barney.

340
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
哦嘿, 你们都在哪里呢?
Oh,hey,where are you guys?

341
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,030
我们在一个募捐会上 帮助一群年轻女性为大学社团筹钱
We're at a fundraiser,helping young women raise money for community college.

342
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,350
脱衣舞馆, 很好
Strip club,nice.

343
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,830
Marshall怎么样了?
Is marshall okay?

344
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,340
他在这里, 他现在很好, 等等别挂
yeah,he's here and he's great.Uh,hang on.

345
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,440
Marshall?

346
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,580
告诉Ted...
Tell ted that--

347
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,920
已经完了?
Already?

348
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
什么? 什么啊哦?
What?What uh-oh?

349
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,060
他不见了
He's gone.

350
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,070
你把他弄丢了?
You lost him?

351
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,150
真不敢相信 他会直接去宾馆找她的
I can't believe this.He's going to go down to that hotel.

352
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,880
伙计, 你说的没错
Crap,you're right.

353
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,530
好吧, 我这里有个计划
Okay,okay,here's the plan,here's the plan.

354
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,530
你直接去宾馆拦住他
You go down to the hotel and find him.

355
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,730
我呆在这里跳舞
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.

356
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,610
- 数三下, 1, 2...
- Barney! On three.One,two... barney!

357
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,250
你叔叔的家里有没有热水浴缸
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

358
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,840
有一个很不错的
A really nice one.

359
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,590
嗨, 你能告诉我Lily Aldrin住在哪个房间吗?
Hi,uh,could you tell me what room lily aldrin's in?

360
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,350
Marshall.

361
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,720
发生什么事了?
What happened?

362
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,220
我上去找了Lily 准备好了说词
Well,I went up to lily's floor,and I had this little speech in my head--

363
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,310
就是那些我这个夏天以来一直想告诉她的话 爱情, 忠诚, 信任
everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love,loyalty,respect.

364
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,400
我敲了门
I knocked on the door.

365
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,220
那么你打了Lily的新男朋友?
So you knocked out lily's new boyfriend?

366
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,410
是的
Yeah.

367
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,030
不过不是Lily的男朋友
It wasn't lily's boyfriend.

368
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,680
什么? 那是谁?
What? Who-- who was it?

369
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,410
他叫Joey Adalian 虽然他作为惯偷一年里面换了无数个名字
Ted: His name was joey adalian,although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

370
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,700
很明显, 早些时候...
Apparently,earlier in the summer...

371
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,980
哦, 真是尴尬
lily: Oh,this is so embarrassing.

372
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,210
我发誓我有零钱的
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

373
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,560
我知道的, 抱歉
I know,I know.I'm sorry.

374
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,990
哦, 有了
Oh,here we go.

375
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,110
不对, 这是一个钮扣
No,that's-that's a button.

376
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,200
这只是一个钮扣
It was a button.

377
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,410
你们这里接受信用卡支付吗?
Do you,uh,take credit cards?

378
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,040
哦是的
Yes,I do.

379
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,790
那么说她没有回来 她也没有新的男朋友?
So lily's not back in town,and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

380
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,970
是个好消息, 不是吗?
Th-that's good news,right?

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,130
是的
Yeah.

382
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,660
我也不知道
I don't know.

383
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,340
那些帐单是我和她保持联系的唯一的方法
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.

384
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,750
我不知道她现在在哪里 也不知道她在做什么
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.

385
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,520
她是我的全部, 但是现在, 她不见了
She was my whole life,man,and now she's-she's gone.

386
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,420
你知道, 大学的第一天, 我很害怕
You know,first day of college,I showed up,I was so freaked out,and-

387
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:38,640
我去了我的寝室, 看到了我的室友 他躺在床上, 脚架在墙上
and I got up to my room,and there was my roommate,lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.

388
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,710
带着耳机, 脸上带着微笑 一副不屑一顾的样子
Had headphones on,big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.

389
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,910
开心
Happy.

390
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,020
自信
Confident.

391
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,310
不担心任何事情
Not afraid of anything.

392
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,440
那个人就是你
That guy was you.

393
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,340
在认识Lily之前的你
You before you met lily.

394
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,940
Ted?

395
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,680
啊?
Yeah?

396
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,810
那天我磕药了
I was high that day.

397
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,350
对
I was.

398
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,740
我太兴奋了, 觉得你是院长
I was so high,I thought you were the dean.

399
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:13,030
我想说的是, 有一个另外的你 没有Lily的你, 而不是现在的你
Wh-what I'm saying is there's a version of you without lily,and it's not this.

400
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,610
你不能让Lily偷走你的人 就像那个男人偷走了她一样
You can't let lily steal your identity the wathat guy stole hers.

401
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,440
明白
Okay.

402
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,640
好的, 决定了
Okay,resolved.

403
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,590
从明天开始, 我就没事了
Starting tomorrow,I'm going to start being okay.

404
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,340
干杯
Cheers.

405
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,330
但是他并没有做到 也许这就是生活
But he wasn't,'cause that's not how life works.

406
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,340
第二天, 他找到了她的一个袜子还是什么的 于是我们又重新回到了起点
The next day,he found one of her socks or something,and we were back to square one.

407
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,010
然后有一天上午...
And then,one morning...

408
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,140
Ted, 我想你应该过来看看
ted,I think you should see this.

409
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,080
哦不, 又怎么了?
Oh,no,what now?

410
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,450
Marshall, 你在干什么?
Marshall,what are you doing?

411
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,260
今天是周日
It's sunday.

412
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,200
该吃点煎饼了
It's pancakes day.

413
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,050
他花了整整67天才终于作出这个恶心的煎饼
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

414
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,040
真不错
so good.

415
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,550
的确不错
So good.

416
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,720
但是至少, Marshall又起死回生了
But marshall had come back from the dead.

417
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,760
因为棒球, 脱衣舞女, 还有枪都不能解决问题
Because while baseball,strippers,and guns can help,

418
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,320
能够治疗一个破碎的心的东西 只有时间
the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
