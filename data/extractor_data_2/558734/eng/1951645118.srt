1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,200
Previously on "desperate housewives,"

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,900
Susan played with fire...

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
that's not my cup.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,600
And could get burned.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,300
Go to a spa or go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,600
- Gabrielle...
- Get here as fast as you can.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,700
...found herself a playmate.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,900
Lynette couldn't get her kids to stop playing.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,800
Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,500
Yeah, I have a theory.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
If I don't start getting some sleep pretty soon,

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,300
I'll be forced to move back
upstairs out of sheer exhaustion.

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,600
And Bree played hardball.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,700
Everyone has a little dirty laundry.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,500
When I was alive, I maintained
many different identities --

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,300
lover, wife, and ultimately, victim.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,100
Yes, labels are important to the living.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,000
They dictate how people see themselves,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,700
like my friend Lynette.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,900
She used to see herself as a career woman,

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,500
and a hugely successful one at that.

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,400
She was known for her power lunches,

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
her eye-catching presentations,

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,700
and her ruthlessness in wiping out the competition.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,000
But Lynette gave up her career to assume a new label --

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,100
the incredibly satisfying role of full-time mother.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,500
Scavo residence.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,900
Yes, this is me.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,500
But unfortunately for Lynette,

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,400
this new label frequently fell
short of what was advertised.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
How in the world did they...

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,600
I left the door to the art supply
cupboard open for five minutes.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That's all.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
Five minutes.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,300
The little girl --
why didn't she say anything?

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
Your boys work quickly.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Well...obviously, they will
be punished for this -- severely.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,700
I hesitate bringing this up, since
you got so ugly about it last time...

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
they don't have attention-deficit disorder,

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,600
and I'm not going to drug my boys
just to make your job easier.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
I'd rather change teachers.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,700
The boys are in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

43
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,100
What if we separate the twins?

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
Put them in different classes?

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,400
They're much calmer when they're
not bouncing off one another.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
We can try that.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,700
But if it doesn't work, we may
no longer be able to accommodate them.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It suddenly occurred to Lynette
her label was about to change yet again...

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,700
come on.

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,300
And for the next few years,
she would be known as...

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,100
the mother of the boys who
painted tiffany axelrod blue.

52
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,300
Episode 4 : Who's that Woman?

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,100
It looked to be an interesting
afternoon on wisteria lane.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,500
A mysterious cassette tape
had been discovered by my friend Bree.

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
She had stolen it from her marriage counselor,

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,400
a counselor I'd once spoken to
in strictest confidence.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
So how have you been?

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,100
I had the nightmare again.

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,000
It's so weird to hear Mary Alice.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Still the same one.

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,700
Yes, but this time, I was standing in a river,

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,900
and I saw the girl under the water, and she
kept screaming "Angela" over and over again.

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,500
So what do you think the significance
of the name Angela is?

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,900
Actually, that's my real name.

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,300
Her real name?

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,800
That doesn't make any sense.

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,700
I've seen her driver's license.
It did not say Angela.

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,000
Just more about her nightmares
and this girl she was afraid of.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,700
So what the hell do we do now?

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,000
I think we should show Paul the note.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you sure? He's going to freak.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,900
Well, it's now or never.

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,300
I mean, I saw what he's asking for the place.
It's going to sell quickly.

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Can I say something?

76
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm glad Paul's moving.

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Gabby.

78
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm sorry. He's just always given me the creeps.

79
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Haven't you guys noticed
he has this dark thing going on?

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
There's something about him that just feels...

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
malignant?

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,100
Yes.

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,300
We've all sort of felt it.

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,200
That being said, I do love
what he's done with that lawn.

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Mom, the dish is clean.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,100
Huh? Oh.

87
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,900
I still don't understand why you don't just
ask him out on an official date date.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh, I'm trying a new strategy.
I'm playing hard to get.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
How long do you think you can keep that up?

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,300
Oh, maybe until noon.

91
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Then I'm going to have to run over
there and beg him to love me.

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Uh, mom,

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,200
I don't think you're going
to be able to wait that long.

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,100
You got to be kidding.
She washed her car yesterday.

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,300
oh, no, she's not.

96
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,900
Yep. She's bringing out the big guns.

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,200
you'd better get over there.
She's wearing cotton.

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
What am I supposed to say to Mike --

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
"I saw you half-naked,
and I thought I'd drop by"?

100
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,500
What's that?

101
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,300
A piece of Mike's junk mail we got by mistake.

102
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,200
I held onto it in case of an emergency.

103
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,800
God bless you.

104
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,700
Hi.

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
Hey, Susan.

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
got this by mistake.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,100
Oh, thanks.

108
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,300
I hope it's not important.

109
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,500
I don't know. It's just a promotion for the rialto.
They're having a film festival.

110
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,200
Oh.

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,000
Well,

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,300
guess I've done my good deed for the day.

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,100
I'll just head back home.

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
Bye.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Hey, you like old movies?

116
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,800
I love old movies. Ha.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
I hate Susan Mayer.

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,500
Every time I see those big doe eyes of hers,

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,400
I swear to god, I just want to
go out and shoot a deer.

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,700
What has she done this time?

121
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,100
She is out there throwing herself
at Mike Delfino -- again.

122
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,500
Susan likes Mike?

123
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,000
Where the hell have you been, martha?

124
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,100
She's been lusting after him
ever since he moved in.

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,500
I got your message.

126
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
What's going on?

127
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,500
The boys refuse to be separated.

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,800
They refuse?

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,200
They're 6 years old. Make them.

130
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Well, school regulations are pretty strict
about me wrestling with the boys.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
But if you want to give it a shot...

132
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,900
be my guest.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,000
Fine.

134
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,700
Which one goes and which one stays?

135
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,300
You pick.

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,200
No!

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,700
You need to be in separate classrooms.

138
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
But we want to be in the same one!
Honey, come on now.

139
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,900
Stop it. Let go! No!

140
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,400
We're going to take the whole table! At's right!

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,700
No. Come on now. I mean it!

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
I love taking baths, especially with you.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,300
It's like taking a vacation from the world.

144
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,100
I hated taking baths when I was a kid.

145
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,900
Of course, back then, the only thing I had
to play with was my rubber ducky.

146
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh.

147
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,900
Who's that?

148
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,100
It's  Mr. Solis.

149
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,300
Relax. Carlos is at work,

150
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,800
and he doesn't ring the doorbell.

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
It's the cable guy.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,700
He's three hours late.

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Use the side entrance.

154
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Gabrielle knew her vacation
from the world had ended.

155
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,100
What she didn't know was

156
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,900
John had left behind a souvenir.

157
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm telling you, dad didn't
come home last night.

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,900
They had a fight -- a bad one.

159
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,700
How bad?

160
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Like divorce court bad.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Listen to her.

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,300
She always overcompensates
when she's worried.

163
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,100
If dad moves out and leaves us with her,

164
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,300
I'll lose my mind.

165
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
Ah.

166
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,100
Dinner is on the table.

167
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,200
Mom, where'd dad go last night?

168
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,300
He got a last-minute call to speak
at a medical conference in Philadelphia.

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,200
Take your seats.

170
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,800
This marriage is so over.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Andrew?

172
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,200
Again, sorry I was late.
The scheduler overbooked me.

173
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,300
How long are you going to be?

174
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Almost done.

175
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,600
What is that scent?

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Is that sage and citrus?
It's amazing.

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.

178
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
Come on.

179
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Aah!

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
What's happening?

181
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,200
The cable guy fell.

182
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,500
He hit his head on the tub.
He may have a concussion.

183
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,900
It's almost 8:00.

184
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,500
He was late.

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,300
Mrs. Huber.

186
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,100
Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.

187
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,800
Oh, wow. Why?

188
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Do I need a motive to do something nice?

189
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,600
I can't wait for you to try this. It's mincemeat.

190
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,300
Actually, I just had dinner.

191
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,700
That's okay. You can save it for later.

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,400
What's so funny?

193
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,600
I was just thinking of that expression
"I'll make mincemeat out of you."

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Mincemeat -- used to be an entrap
made up of mostly chopped meat,

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,000
so it was like saying
"I'll chop you up into little bits."

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But that was centuries ago.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,500
Today, mincemeat is mostly made up
of fruit, spices, and rum.

198
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,700
There's no meat in it, and still people say
"I'll make mincemeat out of you."

199
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't know that people really say that anymore.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
I do.

201
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,300
So, Susan, how are you?

202
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm fine.

203
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Good.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,800
You know, I have a confession to make.

205
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,200
I've always wished I'd have been
more supportive when carl left you.

206
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, you don't have to apologize about carl.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Really, carl and I are over. I've moved on.

208
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
Yes, I know. You've moved on
to that nice Mike Delfino.

209
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,200
He's quite a catch, isn't he?

210
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,500
You like him, don't you?

211
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
Uh, sure, as a friend.

212
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Oh, Susan.

213
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,500
Being coy is a strategy best employed
by virgins at their first dance.

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,200
For women of our age, it's just annoying.

215
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Are you sure you don't want pie?

216
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,600
No, thank you.

217
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I hope it works out with you and Mike.

218
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You've been so desperate to land him.

219
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
What do you --

220
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,900
I am not desperate.

221
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,800
Oh, good lord, Susan, you burned
your rival's house down.

222
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,000
If that isn't desperate, I don't know what is.

223
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,100
Mrs. Huber, with all
due respect, you're crazy.

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
What's that?

225
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,900
I think you recognize it.

226
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,500
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

227
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,800
Well, that's not --

228
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,700
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

229
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,800
My point is this --

230
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
I wasn't there for you when carl left,
but I'm here for you now.

231
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,900
As far as I'm concerned, this is our secret,

232
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,600
and no one ever need know.

233
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, Susan...

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,500
you don't know how good it feels
to finally be able to help you.

235
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
You look so pale.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,300
Now, I insist you try some of my pie.

237
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
Go on.

238
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,900
Did I mention it's mincemeat?

239
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
open the door, please.

240
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,300
Hang on.

241
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,100
What?

242
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
May I come in?

243
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
No.

244
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,200
Well, I want to talk to you.

245
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,100
Then talk.

246
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Where were you last night?

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Brian's.

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just spoke to brian's mother.

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,200
Now tell me again where you were last night,
and this time, don't lie to me.

250
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,800
Where'd you say dad was again?

251
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,300
In Philadelphia?

252
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,100
Andrew, don't change the subject.

253
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm sorry. I-I thought
the subject was telling lies.

254
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,900
I called dad's cell phone.

255
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,400
I know he moved out.

256
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,100
Well, it's just temporary, and --

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,400
I thought it would upset you,
so I was protecting you.

258
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,300
Whatever.

259
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,200
You lied, so stop pretending like you have
some sort of moral authority.

260
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Andrew, just because I chose not to share
my marital problems with you

261
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
does not give you the right to be rude.

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
How about driving my father away?

263
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
Do I get to be rude then?

264
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
Hi.

265
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,200
What's this?

266
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,300
That's a sock.

267
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a man's sock.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,300
I found it under our bed.
It's not mine.

269
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,800
Oh, for god's sakes, Carlos, it's yao lin's.

270
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, she dusts with them.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,300
See?

273
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Socks instead of rags.

274
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,600
Susan, hello.

275
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Mrs. Huber.

276
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,500
Did you and Mike come together?
I saw him over in the fresh produce aisle.

277
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,800
No, like I told you before, we're just friends.

278
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,300
Oh.

279
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,100
By the way, if I didn't make it clear yesterday,

280
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I absolutely did not do
that thing you accused me of.

281
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
Hey, Susan.

282
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Hey, Ms. Huber.

283
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
Nice to see you, Mike.

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Hey.

285
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,500
You like alfred hitchcock?

286
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,300
They're doing a retrospective down at the rialto.

287
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,100
Uh...

288
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm not really a fan.

289
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Oh, come on. How can you not like hitchcock?

290
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,500
I just, uh... don't. Ha ha.

291
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
Oh.

292
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,300
Okay.

293
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Well, uh, nice to see you.

294
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,900
You too, Ms. Huber.

295
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
You're so silly.

296
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Pretending not to like him on my account --
I mean, really.

297
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,800
Will you just drop it?

298
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,100
You shouldn't be rude to me, Susan.

299
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,600
Your secret is not an easy burden to bear.

300
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
That insurance company is putting Edie through hell,

301
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
but still, I've said nothing.

302
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,200
Well -- and the longer it takes for her to get payment,
the longer she'll be staying with me,

303
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,100
eating me out of house and home,

304
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,500
using up my hot water.

305
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,500
What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs. Huber?

306
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,800
Uh, are these together?

307
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,300
Ring it up.

308
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,600
If the school and the pediatrician both
think the twins could stand to be medicated,

309
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
then what's the problem?

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,200
I used to run a company with 85 people,

311
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,900
and now I can't wrangle three
small boys without doping them.

312
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
Talk about feeling like a failure.

313
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,500
Lynette, you are a great mother,
but let's face it, your kids are...

314
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,900
a challenge.

315
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,200
Thank you.

316
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
That's the nicest way you could have said that.

317
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,500
You know, the truth is, when they're not
making me want to tear my hair out,

318
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,100
they're actually really sweet.

319
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm afraid if I change the bad stuff,
I'm going to change the good stuff.

320
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah, it's a tough call.

321
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
Like this mug.

322
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,400
I love this mug.

323
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,700
If I medicate them, are they still
going to make me a mug like this?

324
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,300
You know, it's leaking.

325
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,800
Yeah, I know.

326
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,000
We talked to Paul. We told him
we need to show him something.

327
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,100
He's on his way over.

328
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,500
Thank you.

329
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,800
So, Paul, we noticed that you're selling the house.

330
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes, uh, too many painful memories.
I'm sure you understand.

331
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,400
Well, before you move, we thought
there was something you should know.

332
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,900
It seems there may be more to Mary
Alice's death than you were aware of.

333
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,700
Oh?

334
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Remember when you asked us to pack her things?

335
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,900
Well, when we did, we found a note.

336
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,900
And we think that you should have it.

337
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,100
You can see from the postmark Mary Alice
probably got it the day she died.

338
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,300
Paul, are you going to be okay?

339
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
No.

340
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,700
Have you always cleaned with socks?

341
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,900
Yes.

342
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,100
What is that, a japanese thing?

343
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,600
I am chinese.

344
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't like lying.

345
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Yeah, well, I don't like your ironing, so there.

346
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,900
Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?

347
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,200
Carlos found this under the bed.

348
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh, crap.

349
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,900
It's okay. It was a close call,
but I managed to cover.

350
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,000
I got you these. So from now on,

351
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,200
we can't let Carlos see you around the house
wearing anything resembling a gym sock.

352
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
You want me to mow your lawn in sandals?

353
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Mm-hmm.

354
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,900
I could lose a toe.

355
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,500
Imagine what you would lose if Carlos finds out
you're trimming more than the hedges.

356
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,100
Uh, yeah.

357
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Why are your friends staring at me?

358
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,900
Did you tell them about us?

359
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,400
No.

360
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,200
They're staring 'cause they think you're hot.

361
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh.

362
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Okay.

363
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,000
It's 9:30. What is your brother thinking?

364
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,100
Want my advice?

365
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Call Dad. Go tell him to kick Andrew's ass.

366
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,700
I am perfectly capable of handling
this without your father.

367
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,400
Sorry.

368
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Where's your cell phone?

369
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,000
Call Andrewand find out wre he is.

370
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,400
Mom, he's going to know you're behind this.

371
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,100
No, he won't. Just act normal.

372
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Hey, it's me.

373
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,100
Uh, what's going on?

374
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
He knows.

375
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,300
Andrew, this is your mother.

376
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,400
I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you.

377
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,100
Where are you?

378
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Are you at a bar?

379
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,000
Andrew.

380
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,100
Andrew?

381
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Mom?

382
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
He hung up on me.

383
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,600
What are you going to do?

384
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,200
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! Works for me!

385
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,400
Shake it, baby!

386
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
Over here!

387
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,300
Heath.

388
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
Lan.

389
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Andrew.

390
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,900
Mom, how did you even know I was here?

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
You went in my room?

392
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,900
You think that's bad?

393
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,500
Tomorrow morning, I'm cleaning it.

394
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,300
Oh, by the way, Heath, I didn't get a chance
to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week at church.

395
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you.

396
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
W-we're out of here.

397
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,400
I hope it wasn't something I said.

398
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, Andrew...

399
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,700
shall we?

400
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,300
You just humiliated me inront of my friends.

401
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm not going anywhere with you.

402
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,700
Fine.

403
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,100
What are you doing?

404
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm staying for the show.
I'm dying to see what all the fuss is about.

405
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,700
Uh, excuse me, waitress, I'll have a glass
of your house chardonnay.

406
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,000
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,000
I-I'm curious, Andrew, as you fantasize about this woman,

408
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,900
do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?

409
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
That's someone's little girl,

410
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,500
and that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her,

411
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,200
dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.

412
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,600
It's not going to work, okay?

413
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,700
I'm not budging.

414
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,000
God only knows what she's had to deal with in her life --

415
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,300
abject poverty, drugs, domestic violence,
maybe even molestation.

416
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Mom.

417
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,400
And now she treats herself the way other men treat her --
like an object, a piece of meat.

418
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,800
That does it.

419
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,100
Kid, get her out of here.
She's killing it for the rest of us.

420
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,400
We're not here. Leave a message.

421
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,000
It's Mrs. Huber, Susan. Are you there?

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,100
I can see your lights are on.

423
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,300
I hope you're not screening. That's so tacky.

424
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,700
Listen, I need to talk to you.

425
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,300
My water heater just burst, and it's going to cost me
$600 to get a new one, and I can't afford that.

426
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,800
I'm just beside myself.
Call me as soon as you get in.

427
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,700
Julie, Julie, honey, wake up.
We need to talk.

428
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,900
Can't this wait until morning?

429
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,100
I think I'm being blackmailed.

430
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,000
And when I realized I couldn't
put out the fire, I ran.

431
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I must have dropped the measuring cup in the process.

432
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,500
Mm. Why do I even let you out of the house?

433
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,300
Obviously, I can't let her get away with this.

434
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,200
The only thing to do is go to the police
and tell them what happened.

435
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,000
You can't do that.

436
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Julie, I don't think they'll throw me in jail.

437
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I mean, it was an accident.

438
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,700
Dad won't care if it was an accident.

439
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
You know he'll just use this
as an excuse to reopen custody.

440
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,500
Mom...

441
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I don't want to live with dad.

442
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
I know.

443
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,200
I need to talk to you.

444
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Cool. Sure.

445
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,900
You were working tuesday, right?

446
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,700
Yeah.

447
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,700
You remember the cable guy showing up?

448
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,300
And you usually work till what time -- 5:00?

449
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

450
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,300
Damn it.

451
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,300
It means he was in the house for four hours.

452
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,800
Wait, um... you know,
now that I think about it,

453
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I might not have seen him.

454
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,500
Well, either you saw him
or you didn't. Which is it?

455
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,700
I didn't.

456
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,100
John...

457
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,300
did my wife ask you to lie for her?

458
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,000
Mr. Solis, uh...

459
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,600
I really don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

460
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Thank you.

461
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,600
That's all I needed to know.

462
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Okay, let's run through it one more time.

463
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
Mom, it's not brain surgery.

464
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,200
You'll stand guard while I crawl
through Mrs. Huber's doggie door.

465
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Once inside, I'll find the measuring cup. Simple.

466
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Mm, god. I hate that I'm turning
you into a little thief.

467
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,500
It's our measuring cup. We're
just taking back what's ours.

468
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Hey, that's right.

469
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,700
Ethically, we have nothing to be ashamed about.

470
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,100
Oh, wear these.

471
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,800
I don't want you to leave fingerprints.

472
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
There she goes.

473
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,100
Okay, move.

474
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Oh, so glad to be playing frisbee again.
Here you go. Coming at you.

475
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,200
All right, back up a little more.

476
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
There you go.

477
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,200
Whoo! All right, here we go.

478
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,500
Oh, my! Whoops! Ha.

479
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,600
You better go get that. Yeah.

480
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,000
Mike.

481
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Hey, Susan. I thought that was you.

482
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,200
Uh, yeah. Julie and I are just out tossing the frisbee around,
and it flew off into Mrs. Huber's backyard.

483
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,300
Oh, you need some help?

484
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,200
No. No, no, no.
Uh, Julie's got it.

485
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,200
Okay. Actually, I'm glad I ran into you.

486
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,100
I just wanted to make sure that
things were okay between us.

487
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,800
The other day, you seemed kind of distant.

488
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Distant? What do you mean?

489
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,300
I mean, you're not mad at me
for some reason, are you?

490
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,500
No.
No, no, not at all.

491
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,200
Good. So I'm going to take one more shot at this.

492
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,900
I got tickets for a billy wilder retrospective
wednesday night. I'd love to take you with me.

493
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
You are so sweet. I would love to go.

494
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
All right.

495
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,600
Edie. I thought you'd be at work.

496
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
I'm not feeling well.

497
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,700
I got a sunburn the other day washing my car.

498
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,300
Well, don't just run off.
Come and hang out with us.

499
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Boy, you are one sick ticket.

500
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,400
What?

501
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,100
It's not bad enough that I have to watch you
throw yourself at him every day,

502
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,200
and now you want to make sure
that I see it up close and personal?

503
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
No, it's not like that.

504
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,000
I've got to take off, but I'll call you
about wednesday night, okay?

505
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,200
Edie, wait.

506
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Mike and I were going to go see the movies on wednesday,
and I just thought it would be fun if you joined us.

507
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
You want me to come with you?

508
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,700
Yeah. Yeah, that's okay, isn't it, Mike?

509
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Well, it's, uh, a limited engagement,
and it's sold out. I've only got two tickets.

510
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,300
Edie, wait.

511
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,600
Um... you should take my ticket.

512
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,100
Really?

513
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,600
Is that okay with you, Mike?

514
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Uh... yeah, sure.

515
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,100
So, um...

516
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,800
what time do you want to pick me up?

517
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,300
Well, um...

518
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
Hang on.

519
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,300
Ooh.

520
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,100
You think you can have sex with anyone you want, huh?

521
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,400
Carlos couldn't help but feel proud of himself.

522
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,900
After all, he'd just defended his honor.

523
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Or had he?

524
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,500
Are you gay?

525
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,300
Yes. Is that why you're doing this?

526
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,500
Uh, yeah.

527
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm going to call everyone and be like,
"can you buy some chocolates?"

528
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,900
Ladies.

529
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,700
Hey, Paul. What's up?

530
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,300
I wanted to apologize for my outburst yesterday.

531
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Don't worry about it.
We unloaded a lot on you.

532
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,300
I suppose you're wondering why I
reacted so violently to that note.

533
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,700
Itid cross our minds.

534
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Well, the truth is

535
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,200
Mary Alice was not a well perN.
She was very troubled.

536
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,500
Troubled?

537
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,300
At first, it was harmless.

538
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,800
She would leave herself notes,

539
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,900
reminders like "pick up the milk" or "Zach has a dentist appointment."

540
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,800
But over time, the notes became ugly.

541
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,700
Hateful messages started showing up.

542
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,000
Mary alice was writing them
to me, to Zach, to herself.

543
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Really?

544
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,200
That's why I lost it.

545
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I was reminded of what Zach
and I had been through.

546
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,300
Paul, I'm so sorry.

547
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,900
- We had no idea.
- No.

548
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,900
Well, anyway, uh, I'd appreciate it
if you kept this to yourselves.

549
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,200
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

550
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,300
For Zach's sake.

551
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Of course, of course.

552
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,200
- Yeah. Okay.
- Bye.

553
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,400
Wow.

554
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
Yeah.

555
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,300
I think he's lying.

556
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
So do I.

557
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,300
Bang! Bang! Bang!

558
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,400
You -- you didn't get me!

559
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Bang! Bang! Bang!

560
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,500
Bang! Bang!

561
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Boys, could you get in here, please?

562
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,500
He broke my plane.
Did not.

563
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,500
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, I need you to take some medicine.

564
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Are we sick?

565
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,600
Not exactly. This is a special kind of medicine.

566
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,400
It's -- it's like a vitamin,
and you'll take it every day, okay?

567
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay.

568
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,100
Oops.

569
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,800
Stay right there

570
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,100
Now open up.

571
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,200
Mnh-mnh.

572
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,500
- Here, you --
- no way.

573
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,500
Guy-- here.

574
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,800
- No.
- Mnh-mnh.

575
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,800
In that moment, Lynette made a decision.

576
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
When it came to dealing with her children,

577
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,400
medication was no longer an option.

578
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:23,400
Of course, given her continuing level of frustration,
Lynette also felt a little self-medication couldn't hurt.

579
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,900
So what's your strategy?

580
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,800
Are you just never going to speak to me again?

581
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,100
Something like that.

582
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,600
I suppose I do owe you an apology.

583
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Careful. Wouldn't want you
to strain yourself.

584
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,900
I shouldn't have lied to you about your father.

585
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,800
You and your sister are old enough to
handle the truth, and I'm sorry.

586
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,500
Keep going.

587
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,300
I'm mad at you for about 7,000 other things.

588
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,600
If you tnk I'm going to apologize for taking you
out of a strip club, you're wrong.

589
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I consider it one of my finestoments.

590
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,800
Oh, Andrew.

591
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I know you blame me for what's
happening with your father, but...

592
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,500
it's not entirely my fault,
and I need you to understand that.

593
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,500
I do.

594
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,700
I just... I don't want him to leave.

595
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Neither do I.

596
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,000
Mom?

597
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah?

598
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,400
When can I have my door back?

599
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,100
Three months.

600
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,400
Royal oaks was the scene of a hate crime today

601
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,800
when jonathan lisco, local gay activist
and part-time female impersonator,

602
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,000
was brutally attacked in his home.

603
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,500
Lisco speculated the attack was in response to his efforts

604
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,100
to secure same-sex partner insurance coverage
from his employer cliffside cable.

605
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,400
Police are circulating this sketch of the assailant.

606
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I have to say, you know, certain acts
just speak for themselves.

607
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,700
I've taken a strong stand
with my company... is there something

608
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,600
you want to ask me?

609
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,100
No.

610
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,200
You took it, didn't you?

611
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,100
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

612
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,400
It's my own fault for not hiding the cup.

613
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Obviously, if you're capable of arson,

614
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,000
I should have known you'd be capable
of breaking and entering.

615
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,200
I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. Huber.

616
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,800
I suppose you destroyed it.

617
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,200
Again, I don't know what you're
talking about, but, yeah. I did.

618
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,000
I was going to keep your secret.
It's a shame you couldn't trust me.

619
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,300
You're a piece of work.

620
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,500
You know that?

621
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,200
Oh, Susan, let's not be unpleasant.

622
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,500
We can go back to the same
friendly relationship we've always had.

623
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,000
I will keep my lawn looking nice,

624
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,400
and I will make sure that
my music isn't played too loud,

625
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,000
and if I get some of your mail,
heck, I'll run it right over,

626
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,600
'cause that's what good neighbors do.

627
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
But from now on, when I run into you on the street

628
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,300
and I say "good morning, Mrs. Huber,"
or "how are you, Mrs.Huber?"

629
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:51,800
Just know that inside, I am quietly
but decidedly hating your guts.

630
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,400
Careful, dear.

631
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Let's not say things we'll live to regret.

632
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

633
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,600
He actually said Mary Alice was crazy?

634
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,500
Not in so many words, but everything Paul said
certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic.

635
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,200
I think he's hiding something. I know it.

636
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,300
But wait. What about the tape?
I mean, she did say that her name was Angela.

637
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,800
Mary Alice was not crazy.

638
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
Well, my father was a prosecutor,

639
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,700
and he always said that the simplest
explanation was usually the right one.

640
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,800
But remember what the note said --

641
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,100
"I know what you did. It makes me sick,
and I'm going to tell."

642
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,000
That's not the kind of thing
someone writes to themselves.

643
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,300
That's a message sent by an enemy.

644
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,000
So exactly what is it you hired me to do?

645
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,800
It's very simple, really --

646
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
someone sent that note to my wife,

647
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,400
and I need to know who.

648
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,000
What type of person would send such a note?

649
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Was it an enemy?

650
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,700
Of course.

651
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,200
But what kind?

652
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,800
An acquaintance?

653
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
A stranger?

654
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,900
Or how about...

655
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,000
a neighbor that lives a few feet away?

656
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
