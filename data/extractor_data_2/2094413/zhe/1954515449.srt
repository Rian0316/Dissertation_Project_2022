1
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:09,498
喂 过来这
Psst. In here!

2
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:16,873
终于安全了 先别放松啊
I'm safe. Not quite.

3
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:19,709
请把你的护身符交出来 斯丁森先生
The amulet, please, Mr. Stinson.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,114
为什么
Why?

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,751
救命 救命 那个孩子
Help! Help! The kid.

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,192
救命 撑着点 孩子
Help! Hang on, kid.

7
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,374
赶紧抓着我的领带
Grab my tie.

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,609
可是你不应该把你的领带解下来啊
But you're not supposed to take the tie off.

9
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,112
你跟你的朋友莉莉和马修打赌输了
You lost a bet with your friends Lily and Marshall

10
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,714
所以你必须要戴着领带一整年
which requires you to wear the tie for a full year.

11
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,318
如果这可以救你一命 我相信他们会理解的
If it means saving your life, I think they'll understand!

12
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,887
他们听起来想是非常善良的人啊
They sound like nice people!

13
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:04,921
是的 他们的确是
Yeah, they are.

14
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,923
赶紧抓住
Grab that...

15
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,659
上来吧
Come on.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,428
抓住了
That's it.

17
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,167
谢谢你 先生
Thanks, Mister.

18
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:19,682
我要怎么报答你呢
How can I repay you?

19
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,505
如果你非要坚持的话 好好学习 天天向上吧
You can stay in school, that's how.

20
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,776
不
No!

21
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:27,810
这就是事情的真相
True story.

22
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,612
但是 我会怀念
But golly, I'm just gonna miss

23
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:32,315
那条该死的鸭子领带  真的
the heck out of that ducky tie. I really am.

24
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,351
看看我刚从垃圾堆里发现了什么
Look what I just found in the trash.

25
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,553

No!

孩子们 要是你没有让别人在你干过蠢事的地方
Kids, you haven't truly lived until somewhere,

30
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,787
立上一个警告牌的话 你就不算真正的活过
somebody puts a sign up because of something you did.

31
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:01,824
比如
For instance...

32
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:03,869
请问你们有看到门口的警告牌么
Have you guys seen that sign out front that says

33
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,717
绝对不允许趴板冲浪
"Absolutely No Boogie-Boarding"?

34
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,370
怎么回事呢
What's that all about?

35
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,873
噢 这是个好段子 你有时间听么
Oh, that's a great story. You got time for it?

36
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:13,810
唔 我现在应该是去参加我妈妈的生日派对 所以
Well, I'm supposed to go to my mom's birthday party, so...

37
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,012
请你把这个故事讲的越长越好
please make it as long as you can.

38
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:18,081
好吧 这个事情发生在几个月以前
Well, it happened a few months ago.

39
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,883
在一个飓风袭击的夜晚
The night of the hurricane...

40
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:22,252
孩子们 那是2011年8月26日

41
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,922
飓风艾琳正在袭击整个纽约
and Hurricane Irene was barreling towards New York.

42
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,790
同志们 童鞋们 亲们
Guys, guys, guys.

43
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,492
飓风是一种非常严重的自然灾害
This storm is serious.

44
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,761
幸运的是 你们的朋友是一个前任童子军
Luckily, you are friends with a former Boy Scout.

45
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,196
而且童子军是做什么的
And a Boy Scout is always what?

46
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:34,464
不受欢迎的 被揍的
Unpopular? Beaten up?

47
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:35,765
被妈妈带着一起看电影的
Going to the movies with his mom?

48
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,633
一个童子军是随时做好准备的
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

49
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,469
准备在自己的储物柜里独自享用午餐
Prepared to spend lunch in his locker?

50
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,703
准备在保持处男之身而死

51
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,105
准备去帮自己的姐妹淘涂指甲

52
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,007
是为所有的事防范于未然
Prepared for emergencies!

53
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,441
这就是为什么一个星期以前
That's why a week ago,

54
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,244
当飓风艾琳还是一个热带低气压
when Irene was just a tropical depression-

55
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,112
你就是个热带低气压
You're a tropical depression.

56
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,947
我给大家准备了
This guy got us...

57
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,749
一个应急背包
a disaster backpack,

58
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,551
还有租了一辆五个座位的汽车而且刚好停在楼下

59
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:57,320
我们准备去我位于韦斯切斯特的家
We're gonna drive up to my place in Westchester

60
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,488
在那里可以保证我们的安全
where we'll all be safe.

61
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,290
你们刚刚被童子军拯救了 还有不用谢
Boy Scouted! You're welcome.

62
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,624
泰德是对的 我们应该离开这里
Ted's right, we should go.

63
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,126
嘿 在我们离开这个城市的时候
Hey, on the way out of the city,

64
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,628
你介意在我家停一下我去拿点东西么
do you mind if we stop at my place so I can get something?

65
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,499
可以啊 你准备拿些什么
Okay, what did you have to get?

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,535

00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,172
我们没有时间来做这些了 我们需要赶紧走
We don't have time for this! We gotta get going!

69
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,141
泰德 我比你年长 是的
Ted, I'm older than you. Yeah.

70
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,409
比你魁梧 只有年龄老点
And taller. Just older.

71
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,278
当你到我这个岁数的时候 还有身高
And when you reach my age, and height,

72
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,613
你会感觉一些事情 比如说飓风根本不足一惧
you'll see that things like this hurricane are no big deal.

73
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,215
他们正准备关闭整个大桥
They're going to close the bridges.

74
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,417
大伙们 我们需要赶紧离开这
You guys, we got to get out of here.

75
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,452
我估计这次我要站在小金毛这边
I'm afraid I'm with blondie on this one.

76
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,388
这个飓风根本没什么 我可是来自温哥华的

00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,396
一边喝酒一边看巴尼的硕大的电视
Drinking beer in front of Barney's giant TV

81
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,863
完胜一晚上呆在车里
beats sitting in the car

82
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,165
听艺妓回忆录
listening to Memoires of a Geisha.

83
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,600
拜托 我们可以听最精彩的部分
Come on, we're at the best part.

84
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:47,971
噢 是我妈妈打来的 看看我现在是否安全

00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,808
喔 妈咪 外面现在一团糟

87
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,609
我好怕怕
I'm so scared!

88
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,844
可以穿比基尼的天气
Bikini weather.

89
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,813
马修 你跟我站在统一战线上 对吧
Marshall, you're with me, right?

90
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:59,482
不好意思 老朋友
Sorry, old friend.

91
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:02,385
不过我禁不起命运的诱惑
But I can't afford to tempt fate.

92
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,721
噢 我记得了 我那时候我表现的非常奇怪
Oh right, I was being really weird.

93
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,157
我应该解释一下
I should explain.

94
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,724
去年夏天我辞掉了我的工作
Last summer I quit my job.

95
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,526
然后 在飓风到来的前一周
And then, a week before the hurricane...

96
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:14,965
噢 我的医疗保险过期了
Huh, my medical insurance just expired.

97
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:18,634
在我加入到你的保单计划前 刚好有两周的时间
That gives me two uninsured weeks before I'm added to your plan.

98
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,236
这没什么大不了的
It's no biggie.

99
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,572
噢喔 被纸划伤了
Ow! Paper cut.

100
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:28,578
我们已经被死亡的气息环绕着
Death is all around us.

他基本上表现的非常像埃德加・爱伦・坡

死神的召唤
The Grim Reaper beckons.

104
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:41,591
我感觉到他冰冷的双手缠绕着我的喉咙
I feel his icy grip around my throat,

105
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,094
他的呼吸一直紧随着我的脚跟
the breath of his hounds at my heels,

106
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:50,700
他那紧凑的镰刀砰砰声敲打我的心房 
the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of his scythe on my chamber door.

107
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,836
还有你 和你愉快的请求
And you, with your blithe request,

108
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,206
你只催促他取得死亡的胜利
you only hasten his inevitable triumph.

109
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,375
这就是你的欲望么
Is that what you desire?

110
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,543
这是得你的欲望么 莉莉
Is that what you desire, Lily?

111
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,346
我只是想让你帮忙买点百吉饼回来
I just wanted you to get us some bagels.

112

Why not?

119

还有记住 不要太多奶油芝士
And remember, not too much cream cheese.

120
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,206
涂一半 足量
Half a shmear, max.

00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,216
你知道么 你现在就是非常荒谬啊
Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.

124
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,085
是得 生活有时候就是这么荒谬 莉莉
Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!

125
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:44,620
人们有时候会被公车碾过
People get run over by buses

126
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,657
还有被滑板破蛋 被婴儿咬伤
and hit in the nuts by skateboards, bitten by babies.

127
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,959
没有人一睁开眼就说 今天会在优酷里
Nobody wakes up and says, "Today I'm gonna star

128
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,261
成为明星
in a YouTube video."

129
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:53,396
你说那句话不下十遍了
You've said that at least a dozen times.

你真的理解么 这是有多么的痛苦
Do you have any idea what that's like?

137
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:15,285
如果SEC公司起诉成功的话 这会让我们很头疼的
If the SEC pursues charges, it's going to be all our asses.

138
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:19,589
没有人像我一样严肃的对待这件事

142
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,833
一个小小的领带双关语
A little tie pun.

143
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,602
我跟你没完
This is far from over.

You have a price, Eriksen, and I will find it.

When the end of day is nigh, I'll have taken off this tie.

146

Hey, Nerdlinger,

150
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,524
不都说最安全的蠢蛋么
what's with the safety boner?

151
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,958
我是说 看看你
I mean, come on.

152
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,129
应急装备 车子 还有女式雨靴……
The disaster kit, the car, the ladies' rain boots-

153
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,896
啊 这是男式的
Uh, they're men's.

154
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:03,666
粉色容易被救援者识别
Pink is just easier to spot from the rescue chopper.

155
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,035
听着 原谅我太关心你们了
Look, forgive me for caring about you guys,

156
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,703
但你们是我在这个世界上最好的朋友
but you're my best friends in the world

157
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,572
我只想确保你们平安无事
and I just want to make sure you're okay.

158
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:14,844
啊 泰德 你就是个十足的扫兴鬼
Ah. Ted, you are a giant whining bummer.

159
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:15,811
巴尼 
Barney...

160
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:16,912
放松点 泰德
Come on, Ted,

161
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:20,216
暴风雨没什么大不了的
this storm is not a big deal.

162
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:22,385
暴风雨很猛烈
This storm is a big deal.

163
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:23,853
我们再来看看艾琳飓风
Let's replay that harrowing footage

164
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,655
侵袭北卡罗莱纳的悲惨画面
of Irene touching down in North Carolina.

165
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,895
我们必须离开这里
We gotta get out of here!

166
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,031
走吧 走吧 快点 快点
Go, go! Come on, come on!

167
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,870
-请让我把它摘了吧 -没门
-Please let me take it off! 
-No.

168
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,478
-五千块 -别想
-$5,000? 
-No.

169
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:41,285
他没开玩笑吧
Is he serious?

170
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,419
一万块
$10,000?

171
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,787
-不行  -伙计们 答应他吧
-No. 
-Dudes, take the money.

172
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,189
-两万块  -不可能
-$20,000?  -No.

173
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,157
-同意 -我让你使劲扇我耳光
-Yes. -I'll let you slap me in the face as hard as you can.

174
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,059
我有点兴趣了
You have my attention.

175
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,561
孩子们 你们还记得马修和巴尼的耳光赌约吧
Kids, you remember Marshall and Barney's slap bet.

176
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,464
几年以前 巴尼打赌输给了马修
A few years earlier, Barney lost a bet to Marshall.

177
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:58,202
他的惩罚是在任意时间 任意地点被扇五个耳光
His penalty was five slaps delivered anyplace, anytime.

178
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,471
目前为止 马修已经扇了巴尼四个耳光
So far, Marshall had slapped Barney four times.

179
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,507
这意味着他只剩一个耳光了
Which meant he only had one slap left.

180
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,542
你觉得怎么样 马修
What do you say, Marshall?

181
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,345
你要不要抓住这次“击会”
Are you going to seize this slap-ortunity

182
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,247
还是直接放过它
or let it slap through your fingers?

183
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,149
别让他诱惑你 马修
Don't let him tempt you, Marshall.

184
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,019
我不知道 莉莉 我是说 我们就要有宝宝了
I don't know, Lily. I mean we have a baby on the way.

185
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,654
新的扇耳光机会又这么唾手可得
An extra slap could really come in handy.

186
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,956
不 不
No! No!

187
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,058
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

188
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,295
那条领带你再戴十个月
You having to wear that tie for another ten months

189
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,163
我已经够满足的了
is all the satisfaction I need.

190
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,398
再说
Plus,

191
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,199
我还可以扇一个耳光
I still have one slap left,

192
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,602
-这样感觉很好 -但如果你不留着那个耳光
-and that feels good. -But if you didn't have that slap left-

193
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:36,373
比如说 我会让你今晚就扇
if say, I were to get you to slap me tonight-

194
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,276
我觉得一切都会改变
I suppose that would change everything.

195
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:42,846
我也觉得会
I suppose it would.

196
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:48,052
游戏开始了
Le jeu commence.

197
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:53,023
我是玩家马修
Je m'appelle Marshall.

198
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,827
说说趴板冲浪   回到趴板冲浪
So boogie-boarding... Boogie-boarding.

199
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,628
我试图让这些人离开
So I was trying to get these guys to leave,

200
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,030
但遇到个小问题
but there was one little problem.

201
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,298
来吧 一起走
Come on, let's go.

202
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,399
我留下
I'm staying.

203
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,201
什么 巴尼
What?! Barney?!

204
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,070
嘿 嘿 外面会变得很疯狂
Hey, hey, it's going to get pretty crazy out there.

205
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,138
如果哪个辣妞的衣服都被吹跑了
And if some hot woman gets all her clothes blown off,

206
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,639
而我没有呆在这里把它录下来
and I'm not up here to videotape it

207
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,508
然后传到网上 还能指望谁会这么做呢 联邦应急管理局吗
and put it up on the Internet, who will, FEMA?

208
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,843
好了 醒醒吧
Come on, open your eyes.

209
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,544
不 你和我们一起走
No, no, you are coming with us.

210
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,781
不抛弃不放弃呢 亲
We leave no man behind.

211
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,383
嘿 妈妈
Hey, Mom.

212
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,986
啊 是的 靴子很抢眼
Uh, yeah, the boots were a big hit.

213
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:24,989
我最好上个厕所
You know, I better pee.

214
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,157
等莉莉和我回来 我们就走
But when Lily and I get back, we're all leaving.

215
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,859
什么 我要和你一起上厕所
Wait, I have to go pee with you?

216
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,362
你想让我一个人去“厕所”
You want me to go to the "Bathroom,"

217
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,798
这个世界上最危险的地方
the most dangerous room in the house by myself?

218
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,933
你知道会发生什么吗
Do you have any idea what could happen?

219
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,871
哦 我的眼睛
Ow! My eye!

00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,240
我看不见了
I'm blind!

221
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:48,678
不 不 别这样
No, no! Not like this!

222
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,614
我觉得关于即将发生的事
I don't think we're seeing eye to eye

223
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,682
我们都要持不同意见了
about the likelihood of that happening.

224
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:55,019
嘿 是我爸
Hey, it's my dad.

225
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,388
我爸给我打电话了
My dad's calling me.

226
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,723
嘿 你知道泰德从哪里  得来的靴子

Guys, Dad says this hurricane is a bigger deal than you thought.

230
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,500
我来负责 我们得离开这儿了
I'm taking charge. We are getting out of here.

231
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:12,536
好吧 怎么每个人的父母都打电话来
Okay, what is with everybody's parents calling

232
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:14,038
问候他们
to check up on them?

233
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,173
不过是点小雨罢了
It's just a little rain.

234
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,741
这天气都可以修草坪呢
Lawn-mowing weather.

235
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,876
还可以玩室外地滚球
Bocce weather.

236
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,211
哇 你真是被打击到了
Wow. You're really bummed

237
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,646
你老爸不担心你
that your dad's not worried about you.

238
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,813
什么
What?!

239
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,783
呃 我爸有什么好担心的
Eh... What would my dad be worried about?

240
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:29,853
我没抹够防晒霜吗
That I'm not wearing enough sunblock?

241
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,122
仅仅是能粉刷房子的天气吧
House-painting weather.

242
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,391
泰德 你回来了
Ted, you're back.

243
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,160
我改变主意了 我跟你们一起 走吧
I've changed my mind. I'm in. Let's go.

244
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,894
是的 我也改变主意了 你不能来
Yeah, I changed my mind, too. You can't come.

245
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,296
其他人 我们一起出去
Everybody else, we're moving out.

246
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,631
太伤人了
That's harsh.

247
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,934
你知道还有什么伤人吗 紫外线
You know what else is harsh? Ultraviolet light.

248
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,835
这礼拜我在晒黑床上睡着了
I fell asleep in the tanning bed this week

249
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:48,072
我想我的脸被晒伤了
and I think I got a sunburn on my cheek.

250
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:50,507
它好敏感
It's so sensitive.

251
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,177
看起来就像大大红红的公牛眼
It's like a big, red bull's-eye.

252
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:54,478
疼疼哟
Ouchie.

253
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,880
你是不是把腮红从我包里拿走了
Did you take my blush out of my purse?

254
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,683
说说趴板冲浪
So, boogie-boarding.

255
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:01,151
对 趴板冲浪
Boogie-boarding.

256
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,586
哦 算了 泰德
Oh, come on, Ted,

257
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,920
你不能就这样把他留下
you can't just leave him here.

258
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,189
啊 是的 我可以
Uh, yeah, I can.

259
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,391
你说我是一个十足的扫兴鬼
You called me a giant whining bummer.

260
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,858
你不能上我的车
You're not allowed in my car.

261
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,462
你不会知道艺妓有没有遇见真爱
You don't get to find out if the geisha finds love.

262
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,696
这是原则问题
This is about principle.

263
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,568
嘿 泰德 我准备好了
Hey, Ted. I'm ready to go.

264
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,503
你就是传说中的原则吧
And you must be "Principle."

265
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:22,339
啊 插播一下 伙计们 这是玛雅
Ah, on a separate note, guys, this is Maya.

266
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,873
我刚在大厅外面认识她
I just met her out in the hall.

267
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,175
我们有很多共同点
We have a lot in common,

268
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,910
比如说都爱乡村音乐
such as our mutual love of country music,

269
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,579
全美汽车比赛协会还有杰夫・福克斯伍斯（乡村音乐家） 别深究
NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy. Just go with it.

270
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,347
她需要搭便车出城
She needed a ride out of the city,

271
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,416
我们又有一个空位 所以 
and we have an extra seat in the car, so...

272
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,817
好 我们出发
Okay, let's hit it!

273
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,185
哇噢
Wow.

274
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,753
事情发展成这样
It's come to this.

275
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:38,222
你本可以帮助一个朋友
You could help a friend,

276
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:40,190
但你却选择了一个穿紧身背心
but instead, you're choosing the hot girl in

277
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,492
的辣妹
the tight tank top.

278
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,495
你出师了
Your training is complete!

279
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,730
我真为这孩子骄傲
I'm so proud of this kid!

280
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,266
言归正传 暴风雨就要来了
But seriously, the storm's coming in,

281
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,734
甩了这个小妞 走起
so dump the hoochie and wheels up.

282
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,236
你答应给我留个位置的
You promised me a seat.

283
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,237
哦 看在上帝的份上
Oh, for God's sake.

284
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,804
你们都去 我留下
You two both go. I'll stay here.

285
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,473
-什么 莉莉 不    -我坐副驾
-What? Lily, no!  -Shotgun!

286
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,908
你留下 那莉莉就和我们一起 什……
You're staying. Then Lily can come! Wha...?

287
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,611
-不不不 我就留在这儿     -为什么
-No, no, no, I'll stay here.    -Why?

288
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,614
我只想离开你一会儿
I just want some time away from you!

289
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,083
什么
What?

290
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,253
马修 对不起 我爱你
Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you,

291
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,556
但这两个星期里 我没有单独待过一秒
but I haven't had a second alone in weeks!

292
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,224
这可是暑假啊
It's summer vacation!

293
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,760
我只想坐在浴缸里读书
All I want to do is sit in the bathtub

294
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,995
但现在……
and read a book, but now...

295
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:22,199
宝贝 我忘记带书了
Baby, I forgot to bring a book.

296
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,069
你介意把书给我读出来吗
Do you mind reading yours out loud?

297
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,572
嘿 我也觉得不爽好吧
Hey, it's been no picnic for me either.

298
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,073
你甚至不模仿角色的语调
You don't even do the voices.

299
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,378
没来电显示
Blocked number.

300
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,179
你好
Hello?

301
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,515
小罗宾吗 我是你爸
RJ? It's your father.

302
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,917
爹地
Daddy?

303
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,986
我爱你
I love you.

304
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:44,521
你打电话来对我真的很重要
It means so much that you called.

305
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,691
哈 我就知道你在等他的电话 小样
Ha! I knew that you wanted him to call. Busted!

306
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,494
那是你吗
That was you?

307
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,095
我真的认为你该扇他
I really think you should slap him.

308
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,096
你该狠狠的扇他
You should slap him!

309
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:53,797
扇他 扇他
Slap him. Slap him.

310
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,765
两边的脸都等着你哦
Two cheeks, no waiting.

311
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:58,635
好啊 我确实感觉该扇他
Good, 'cause I really think I'm gonna slap him!

312
00:12:58,636 --> 00:12:59,469
那么 趴板冲浪
So, boog -boarding?

313
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,204
嗯
Boogie-boarding.

314
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,638
别这样啊 泰德
Come on, Ted.

315
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,807
你宁愿随便带上个妓女
You're gonna give some random floozy a ride,

316
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:04,974
也不愿意捎带上巴尼么
but not take Barney?

317
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,510
妓女
Floozy?!

318
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,844
如果她走我就不走
If she's going, I'm not going!

319
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,279
-莉莉 你留下   -我们走
Lily, you're staying.   -Let's go.

320
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,681
如果莉莉留下 我也要陪她
If Lily's staying, then I'm staying!

321
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:12,048
-那我就要走   -那我也走
-Then I'm going.   -Then I'm going.

322
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,184
你不能走 马修 因为我要走
You can't go, Marshall, 'cause I'm going.

323
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:16,520
-如果巴尼要走 我就不走   -那我就可以走了
-If Barney's going, I'm not going!   -Then I can go.

324
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,854
-那我留下   -那我也留下
-Then I'm staying.   -Then I'm staying.

325
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:18,855
那我走
Then I'm going.

326
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:19,956
那我就不走了
Then I'm not going.

327
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,192
好吧 你知道么 我决定走
Okay, you know what? I'm going.

328
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,228
这阵风暴在多普勒天气雷达上出现了一个礼拜了
This storm's been on Doppler radar for a week.

329
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,129
而我却是唯一为之做了准备的人
I'm the only one who prepared for it.

330
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,265
而你们却一直取笑我 你们猜猜我会干啥
And you all made fun of me. So guess what?

331
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,267
我这个童子军要走了 拜拜了您们啦
This Boy Scout is taking a hike. Good-bye!

332
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:36,406
玛雅 快速回答一下 你感觉我们俩有可能么
Maya, real quick, did you think there was anything here, or...

333
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:37,407
哦 我有男朋友了
Oh, I have a boyfriend.

334
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:38,542
再见
Good-bye!

335
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:41,378
额 泰德
Um, Ted...?

336
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,813
疏散的时间已经结束了
The time for evacuation is over.

337
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:46,049
大家应该呆在室内
Everyone should now go inside and be prepared

338
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,253
直到最早礼拜天下午
to stay inside until weather conditions improve,

339
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,856
天气情况转好为止
which won't likely be until Sunday afternoon.

340
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,259
我们被困在这里了么
We're stuck here?

341
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,193
好吧  别紧张
Okay, let's not panic.

342
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:04,301
我们还是紧张吧
You know what? Let's panic.

343
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,364
嘿 如果我们撑不过今晚
Hey, if we don't make it through the night,

344
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:17,759
我希望你们能知道 我想严肃的说
I want you guys to know, and I really mean this...

345
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,005
我希望我能在20岁那年过得更放浪 结交更多的朋友
I wish I had branched out and made more friends in my 20s.

346
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,245
好吧
Well,

347
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,163
我要去厕所了
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

348
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,881
我猜 就我一个人了吧
By myself, I guess.

349
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,117
小心有熊
Watch out for bears.

350
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:41,325
既然今晚可能会是最后的一晚了 我得坦白一些东西
Since this might be the end, I gotta confess something.

351
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,326
可以么
Can I?

352
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,894
请便
Might as well.

353
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:48,332
在过去的一段时间里
Barney and I have been doing the wild thing...

354
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,934
除掉去年巴尼和马修的妈妈鬼混的一小段时间
this whole time.

355
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,804
我和巴尼
Except a brief period last year when he was shacking up

356
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,573
经常滚床单
with Marshall's mom.

357
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:59,176
幸运的是 3P已经提上了日程 所以
But luckily, three-ways were on the menu, so...

358
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:02,113
马修 你知道她没说那些 是吧
Marshall, you know she didn't say any of that, right?

359
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:05,616
是的 但我就是想狠狠的抽他
I know, but I just want to slap him so bad!

360
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:08,919
但这个领带看上去蠢透了 但我还是很想扇他
But that tie is so stupid! But the slap would feel so good!

361
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,854
但他恨透了这条领带
But he hates that tie so much!

362
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,090
或许我可以帮上一些忙
Perhaps I can help.

363
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:16,893
马修 问问自己这个问题 为什么是今天
Marshall, ask yourself this question: why today?

364
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,432
他整整憋了几个星期没去抱怨这条领带
He hasn't said anything about that tie for weeks,

365
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,033
一直到 今天
and yet, suddenly today,

366
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,935
他就不能再戴着这条领带多一秒么
he can't wear it another second?

367
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,704
不 因为这其中必然有隐情
No, there's a reason.

368
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,373
你一定隐藏了一些什么
You've got something coming up.

369
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:31,475
一些你不想说出来
Something where you're

370
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:34,845
显得自己处于弱势
on display, vulnerable...

371
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,912
并暴露自己的事情
exposed.

372
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,183
这跟工作无关
It's not work-related.

373
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,619
哦 这一定是跟情感挂钩的
No, this is relationship stuff.

374
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,388
你一定是想让某些人对你印象深刻
You're trying to impress someone.

375
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:45,756
在你开篇撒的那个谎中
In the lie you told,

376
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:47,724
你说你被两个傻子追着
you said you were being chased by two goons.

377
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,092
所以是两个人
So it's two people.

378
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,628
可能是一对情侣
A couple, perhaps.

379
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,366
你明天要去见诺拉的父母
You're meeting Nora's parents tomorrow!

380
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,834
不对
Wrong!

381
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,936
错 错 错 错 错
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

382
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:03,240
是两天后 我真的希望他们能够喜欢我
It's in two days, and I really want them to like me!

383
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,176
哦 理疗师般的推理
Oh-ho! Therapisted!

384
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,810
该说心理医师的推理 
Shrinked? Shrunk?

385
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,011
我回头会弄清楚的
We'll figure it out.

386
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,680
那么 趴板冲浪
So, boogie-boarding.

387
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,981
嗯 趴板冲浪
Boogie-boarding.

388
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,818
嘿 莉莉 我能和你说几句话么
Hey, Lily, can I talk to you for just a second?

389
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,454
来
Come here.

390
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,791
马修 如果你让我来帮你刷牙 我发誓...
Marshall, if I'm in here to brush your teeth, I swear to...

391
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,495
很抱歉 最近我这么黏人
I'm sorry that I've been so needy lately.

392
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,730
我知道 你需要一些独处的时间
I know that you need some time alone.

393
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:29,600
那么 我去别的房间了
So... I'll be in the other room.

394
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:32,703
你哪儿也不用去
You're not going anywhere.

395
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,208
嗯 嘿
Mmm... Hey...

396
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:41,412
有趣的是
And the funny thing is,

397
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,481
自从那晚上之后 我们永远都不会一个人了
after that night, we'll never be alone again.

398
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,617
你们在我的浴室里尽情的翻滚了
You made that in my bathroom?

399
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:49,019
哇哦
Whoops.

400
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,822
哇 一个飓风孩子
Wow, a hurricane baby.

401
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:54,658
哇哦 伙计 艾瑞克森 飓风 可是个好名字
Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would be a sweet name.

402
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,594
这是个爆好的名字啊
It would be a crazy sweet name!

403
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,629
谢谢了您呐  泰德
Thanks, Ted.

404
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,532
不管怎么说 第二天危险过去了
Anyway, the next day, after the danger had passed...

405
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,900
关门了
It's closed.

406
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:04,901
现在怎么说
Now what?

407
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,904
童子军总是有所准备的
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

408
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:09,906
嘿
Hey!

409
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,409
好样的
Nice!

410
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,677
为我们在飓风中幸存下来 干杯
To surviving the hurricane.

411
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:14,678
耶
Yay!

412
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,715
-我爱你们   -我也爱你
-I love you guys.   -Love you.

413
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:20,451
那周晚些时候我才回到了公寓
I did finally make it up here to the house later that week

414
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:22,586
发现一颗倒了的橡树
only to find that a falling oak tree had

415
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,154
压在了客厅里
landed in the living room.

416
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:27,090
如果我们在那儿的话 会被像虫子一样被压死的
If we'd been here, it would have crushed us like bugs.

417
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,426
看到没有 孩子们 永远没有办法知道
You see, kids, there's no way of knowing for sure

418
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,927
哪儿才是最安全的地方
where the safest place is...

419
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:34,431
所以最好的期望就是 找到一些好伙伴
so the best you can hope for is to have some good company.

420
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,767
伙计们 你们猜我用这个当滑板冲浪能冲多远
Guys, how far do you think I can boogie-board on this thing?

421
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,201
心有多远你就能冲多远
So far!

422
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,171
马修 你的医保要到明天才能生效
Marshall, your insurance doesn't kick in till tomorrow.

423
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,407
无所谓
Yeah, well, you know what?

424
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:44,975
享受生活从这一刻就生效了
Life kicks in right now.

425
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,353
别担心 他没伤着
Don't worry, he wasn't hurt...

426
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,155
当然 那是第一次冲得时候 我有急救夹板
the first time. I have splints!

427
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,491
第二次嘛 他直接穿过了酒吧的窗户
The second time he went through the front window of Maclaren's.

428
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,793
就是现在放着 严禁爬版冲浪标志的地方
Hence the "No Boogie-boarding" Sign.

429
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:04,928
好的 伙计们 我要走了
All right, guys, I gotta go.

430
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,665
巴尼 祝你见诺拉父母时好运
Barney, good luck with Nora's parents.

431
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,666
-拜   -拜
Bye.   -Bye.

432
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,667
再见
See you later.

433
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,635
-好的 再见   -再见
-All right. See you.   -See ya.

434
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,970
嘿 巴尼
Hey, Barney?

435
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:14,871
嗯
Hmm?

436
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:16,907
听着 我们在你的浴室
Listen, um, we made a baby

437
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,509
造出了宝宝
in your bathroom.

438
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,010
所以我们欠你个人情
So we owe you one.

439
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,246
所以我们认为
So we say...

440
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,382
你可以拿掉那个鸭子领带
you can take off the ducky tie.

441
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,787
代价是再被我扇三巴掌
For three slaps.

442
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,655
三巴掌
Three slaps?

443
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,491
事先澄清一下 是追加三巴掌
And to be clear, this would add three slaps

444
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:38,161
加上之前剩下的一个 一共是四巴掌
to Marshall's existing one, giving him four slaps in total.

445
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:38,995
成交
Deal.

446
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,266
我自由了
I'm free!

447
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,170
天啊 这感觉太好了
