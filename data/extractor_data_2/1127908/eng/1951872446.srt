1
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:05,834
<i>No, it's "Wo de ming
zi shi Sheldon."</i>

2
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:14,279
What's this?

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,832
That's what you did.

4
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:21,641
I assumed as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,859
Well, it's not.

6
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:25,489
How am I supposed
to know that?

7
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:30,560
As the teacher, it's your obligation to separate
your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,391
You know, I'm really glad
you decided to learn Mandarin.

9
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:34,597
Why?
Once you're fluent,

10
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:37,864
you'll have a billion more
people to annoy instead of me.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,605
Hey.

12
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:45,907
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

13
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:50,759
My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

14
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:53,288
Why are you
learning Chinese?

15
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,093
I believe the
Szechuan Palace

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,768
has been passing off orange
chicken as tangerine chicken,

17
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,551
and I intend to
confront them.

18
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:03,994
If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,110
I need to use your window.
-Oh, hey. Yeah, No, sure. Go ahead.

20
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:14,781
Hey, jerk face,
you forgot your iPod!

21
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,616
What's going on?
-Oh, I'll tell you what's going on.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,464
That stupid self-centered bastard 
wrote about our sex life in his blog!

23
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,399
Drop dead, you stupid
self-centered bastard!

24
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,176
Thank you.

25
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,306
Okay, where were we?

26
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:40,287
Not now. I have a blog to find.

27
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:57,903
<i>The Big Bang Theory
Season 1 - Episode 17 (Finale)</i>

28
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:02,921
<i>Sync: WorkBook
- www.Qsubs.co.il -</i>

29
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:04,822
+

30
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:12,977
Penny, are you okay?

31
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:15,236
<i>I'm fine, Leonard.
Just go away.</i>

32
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,593
Look, I understand that breaking up 
with someone can be very painful...

33
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,029
<i>Go away!</i>
-Okay. Feel better! Bye.</i>

34
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,732
She doesn't want to talk.

35
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,399
Not surprising.
Penny's emotional responses

36
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,191
originate in the primitive portion 
of the brain known as the amygdale,

37
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:39,469
while speech is centered in the 
much more recently developed neo-cortex.

38
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,244
The former can easily
overpower the latter,

39
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:44,435
giving scientific credence to the 
notion of being "rendered speechless."

40
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,360
Or maybe she just doesn't want
to talk.

41
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,590
Hey, look, I found an iPod.

42
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:04,668
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

43
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,475
What else? Sell it on eBay
as "slightly used."

44
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,868
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

45
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:15,122
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog,

46
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,909
which I cannot find anywhere.

47
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:21,739
You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

48
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:25,331
Good idea. Sit with her,
hold her, comfort her.

49
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:29,414
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

50
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,022
I'm not going to
do that, Howard.

51
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:35,026
I'm not aware
of any social convention

52
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,818
that requires you
to intervene at all.

53
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:39,241
What about "damsel in distress"?

54
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,306
12th-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

55
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,621
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

56
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,300
I don't care. She's upset.
I'm going over there.

57
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,087
Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

58
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,908
I'm her friend. I'm not going to take
advantage of her vulnerability.

59
00:03:57,016 --> 00:04:00,021
Wha...? So you're saying
if in the depths of despair

60
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,698
she throws herself at you
and demands you take her,

61
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,183
right there, right now,
you'll just walk away?

62
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:08,645
I said I'm her friend,
not her gay friend.

63
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,599
Hey, listen, I know you said that
you didn't want to talk... -I don't.

64
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:17,718
Sorry.

65
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:19,850
Wait? Did you say "wait"?

66
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,696
Tell me the truth.

67
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,046
Am I just an idiot who picks
giant losers?

68
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:29,442
No, no.
-Okay.

69
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,594
So I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

70
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:33,852
Of course not.

71
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:37,092
Well, it's got to be
one or the other. Which is it?

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,366
I'm sorry.
What were the choices again?

73
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,441
I really thought
Mike was different.

74
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:50,634
I thought he was
sensitive and smart.

75
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,810
I mean, not you smart--
normal non-freaky smart.

76
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,791
Yeah. No, sure.
You know,

77
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:59,619
and then he just goes and has to
humiliate me by writing about me on his blog

78
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,606
so the entire world can read it.

79
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,340
I tell you, it's not all
that easy to find.

80
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,830
Yeah, really? Well, my friends at
work found it. my sister found it.

81
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:12,086
Judging by my email, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

82
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,053
What exactly did
this guy write?

83
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,842
Not that I need to know the details
of your sex life. I just thought...

84
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,053
Never mind.

85
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,787
No, you know what?

86
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,452
you might as well read it.
Everybody else has.

87
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,571
Go ahead.

88
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed!

89
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,179
I just want to crawl
into a hole and die!

90
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:39,414
Okay. Well, you know
this isn't that bad.

91
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:43,145
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman,

92
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:48,471
who's open to expressing her affection
in non-traditional locales.

93
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,066
Oh, God!

94
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:55,427
Elevators, parks,
movie theaters.

95
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,677
Out of curiosity,

96
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,200
is this "subway" the transportation system
or Subway the sandwich shop?

97
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,714
Sandwich shop.

98
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,591
Doesn't that violate
the health code?

99
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,396
No, at the sub shop
we were only making out.

100
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,833
Ah, okay.

101
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,139
But my point is that

102
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,093
you have absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed.

103
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,150
Really? Do you think
I overreacted?

104
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:24,569
Maybe a little. -Because I do that.
I do overreact.

105
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,375
Maybe I should call Mike
and apologize.

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,995
No, no, no. That, that would
be under-reacting.

107
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,906
He did break the implied
confidentiality of the bedroom.

108
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,996
And in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast food franchise.

109
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,952
You're right. I should just say
"I am done with him."

110
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,793
Yes, you should.
Go ahead, say it.

111
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:47,379
But I never gave the man
a chance to explain.

112
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:51,915
What is there to explain?
It's all right here. The betrayal!

113
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:54,982
No, you were right
the first time.

114
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,496
This is a man who loves me,
but in his own stupid way,

115
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,095
which is trying to show people
how he feels.

116
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,415
I'm pretty sure
I never said that.

117
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:08,978
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

118
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,357
Oh, good for me.

119
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:13,604
Where are you going?

120
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:14,854
I'm going over to Mike's.

121
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,885
Leonard, thank you so much.
-Oh, sure.

122
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,853
Maybe I am her gay friend.

123
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:35,643
Howard, I'm going to need
another Mandarin lesson.

124
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,304
I obviously didn't make
my point with those people.

125
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,464
For God's sake, Sheldon, if you
don't like the tangerine chicken,

126
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,060
don't order
the tangerine chicken.

127
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,360
I like tangerine chicken, I'm just
not getting tangerine chicken.

128
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,957
Can we please change
the subject?

129
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:51,993
Sure.

130
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:55,710
Tell us again how you screwed up and got 
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

131
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,784
Just roll the dice.

132
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:05,211
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here until you roll

133
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,061
"two, four or six."
-She was mad at him!

134
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,578
She was done with him!
The relationship was broken beyond repair,

135
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,282
and I walked over there,
and I fixed it.

136
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,913
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

137
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,762
Actually, I thought the first two
renditions were far more compelling.

138
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,481
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character,

139
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,319
now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

140
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:32,110
Eat your tangerine chicken.

141
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:35,360
I'd love to, but I don't
have tangerine chicken.

142
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,984
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice!

143
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,879
Incredible.

144
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,664
You managed to screw
up the screw-up.

145
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,085
I'm back.

146
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,421
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

147
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,038
What happened?

148
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:08,999
Well, I went over to Mike's to make up
with him. -Yeah. No, I know that part.

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,380
But he had already moved on.

150
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:13,830
Already? That was quick.

151
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:18,752
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs arond his neck.

152
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,565
Penny, I am so sorry.

153
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,957
How could he do that?!

154
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:29,252
Well, you know, you did
throw an 80-gig iPod...

155
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,884
Yeah, no, how
could he do that?

156
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:35,274
I swear to God I am done
with guys like that.

157
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:39,032
You know, macho with the perfect
body and the hair and the money.

158
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:41,520
Yeah, that must get old quick.

159
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:45,783
You know, just once I would like
to go out with someone

160
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:50,576
who is nice and honest
and who actually cares about me.

161
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:53,810
What about me?

162
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,246
What about you what?

163
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,344
What about if you
went out with me?

164
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,373
Are you asking me out?

165
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,629
Um, yes, I am...

166
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,483
asking you out.

167
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,214
Wow.

168
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,920
I was just going off
your comment ae nice guy...

169
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,162
No, I know, I got that. 
-You know, and honest. -Yeah, totally.

170
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:20,733
So, but...
it's no big deal.

171
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:21,941
Yes.

172
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,381
Yes what?

173
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,760
Yes, I will go out with you.

174
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,180
Really?

175
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,119
Yeah.

176
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,625
Why not? I mean... 
what do I have to lose?

177
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,697
Yeah.

178
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,354
That's the spirit.

179
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:47,798
+

180
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,329
Show me your citrus peels.

181
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:58,219
Show me your citrus peels.

182
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,649
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,013
Look, do you have second?

184
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,844
A second what,
pair of underwear?

185
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,274
I was just wondering if
I could talk to you.

186
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,662
It's about Leonard.

187
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,801
Why me? Why not
Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

188
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,758
Well, Raj can't talk
to me unless he's drunk,

189
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,081
and Wolowitz is, you
know, disgusting.

190
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:29,058
Yes, I suppose he is.

191
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,872
All I'm saying is,
you know Leonard the best.

192
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:34,257
Not necessarily.

193
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,487
I'm often surprised by 
my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

194
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,717
Just the other day I discovered
he not only has a loofah,

195
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,239
he hides it.

196
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,337
Why do you suppose a man would be 
ashamed of having a loofah?

197
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,094
I, myself, prefer to have
my excess epithelial cells

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,170
slough off naturally,
but I don't condemn

199
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,564
those who seek
to accelerate the process.

200
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,630
...and until recently
I had no idea

201
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,558
that despite his
lactose intolerance,

202
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,434
he can tolerate small
amounts of non-fat ice cream

203
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,530
without producing a noxious
gas that I maintain,

204
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,656
in the right concentration,
could be weaponized.

205
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,264
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

206
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,055
We're not done?

207
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,031
No.

208
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,805
Eh, why not? We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

209
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,721
Okay, so here's the thing...

210
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,226
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

211
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,476
Well, he didn't actually
say anything,

212
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,092
but when he came back
to the apartment

213
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:35,059
he was doing a dance that brought
to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.

214
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,828
Oh, that's nice.

215
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,446
Anyhow, the thing I wanted
to talk to you about is,

216
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,564
you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends...

217
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,465
I was just...

218
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:45,481
You want to sit down?

219
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,282
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

220
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,930
See, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never really chosen a place to sit.

221
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:55,261
Well, choose.

222
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,370
There are a number
of options, and...

223
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,810
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities,

224
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:05,338
air flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

225
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:07,817
All right, why don't you
just pick one at random

226
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,062
and then if you don't like it you can
sit somewhere else next time.

227
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,026
No, no. That's crazy.

228
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,408
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

229
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,143
Okay.

230
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,387
Um, here's the thing.

231
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,487
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had

232
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:27,455
a little crush on me...
-A little crush?

233
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,193
Well, I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus
had a "little crush" on Helen of Troy.

234
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,554
All right, yeah, I don't
really know who they are, but...

235
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,386
Well, Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
-I don't care. I don't care. Listen.

236
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,526
The point is,

237
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,578
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

238
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:47,944
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

239
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,974
Would you be open
to rotating the couch
clockwise 30 degrees?

240
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,912
No. What I'm saying is

241
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,977
Leonard might be
different in a good way.

242
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,297
Obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

243
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,392
Your last one worked
out well for Koothrappali.

244
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,157
He got a free iPod.

245
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,107
Oh, glare.

246
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,110
But on the other hand, if things
don't go well with Leonard,

247
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,259
I risk losing a
really good friend.

248
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,187
I mean, I'm guessing he's not
looking for a fling.

249
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,393
He's the kind of guy that
gets into a relationship for...

250
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,563
 I don't know,
like you would say,
light years.

251
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,317
I would not say that.

252
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:25,210
No one
would say that.
A light year is a unit
of distance not time.

253
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,616
Thank you for the clarification.

254
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:35,942
Draft.

255
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:40,212
you see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

256
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:43,895
"Foot-pound" has the same problem--
that's a unit of work, not of weight.

257
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,201
Right. Thanks.
-It's a common mistake.

258
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,446
Not the first one
I've made today.

259
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,565
Okay...

260
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,518
I think this will be my seat.

261
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,172
Sheldon, do you have anything to say
that has anything to do with, you know,

262
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:59,148
what I'm talking about?

263
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,276
Well, let's see...

264
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,323
We might consider
Schrodinger's cat.

265
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:07,306
Schrodinger?
Is that the woman in 2A?

266
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:08,780
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

267
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,036
And she doesn't have a cat,
she has a Mexican hairless.

268
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,271
Annoying little animal. Yip, yip...
-Sheldon!

269
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,747
Sorry, you diverted me.

270
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:20,431
Anyway, in 1935,
Erwin Schrodinger,

271
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,845
in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics,

272
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,246
he proposed
an experiment

273
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:29,111
where a cat is placed in a
box with a sealed vial of poison

274
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,876
that will break open
at a random time.

275
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:34,820
Now, since no one knows when
or if the poison has been released,

276
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,646
until the box is opened,

277
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:40,443
the cat can be thought of
as both alive and dead.

278
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,475
I'm sorry.
I don't get the point.

279
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,745
Well, of course you don't get
it; I haven't made it yet.

280
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,123
You'd have to be psychic to get it,
and there's no such thing as "psychic."

281
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,520
Sheldon, what's the point?!

282
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,847
Just like Schrodinger's cat,

283
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,383
your potential relationship
with Leonard right now

284
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,798
can be thought of
as both good and bad.

285
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,084
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

286
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:10,288
Okay, so you're saying I should
go out with Leonard.

287
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,940
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:17,272
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger...

289
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:20,886
Two seats right there.

290
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,126
<i>Chung shu shway?</i>

291
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,492
<i>Shay shay.</i>

292
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,038
Sheldon, I think I've
made a mistake.

293
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,786
I can see that. Unless you're
planning on running a marathon,

294
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:41,175
choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

295
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,029
No, it's about Penny.

296
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,217
A mistake involving Penny...

297
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,804
Okay, you'll have
to narrow it down.

298
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,058
I don't think I can go
out with her tonight.

299
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,364
Then don't.

300
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,179
Other people would
say "Why not?"

301
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,159
Other people might
be interested.

302
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,695
I'm going to talk anyway.
-I assumed you would.

303
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:05,993
Now that I'm actually
about to go out with Penny,

304
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,493
I'm not excited-- I'm nauseous.

305
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,669
Ah, then your meal choice
is appropriate.

306
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,434
Starch absorbs fluid which
reduces the amount of vomit

307
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,025
available for violent expulsion.

308
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,707
Right. -You also made
a common grammatical mistake.

309
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:21,422
You said "nauseous,"
when you meant "nauseated."

310
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,563
But go on.

311
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,196
Sheldon, this date is probably
my one chance with Penny.

312
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,561
What happens if I blow it?

313
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,383
Well, if we accept your premise

314
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:34,072
and also accept the highly
improbable assumption

315
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:36,154
that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you,

316
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,407
then we can logically
conclude that the result

317
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,323
of blowing it would be that
you end up

318
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,794
a lonely, bitter old man
with no progeny.

319
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,216
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers

320
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,441
<i>from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.</i>

321
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:49,661
yy
You're not helping.

322
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:53,132
All right, what response on my part
would bring this conversation

323
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,500
to a speedy conclusion?

324
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,722
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

325
00:17:56,924 --> 00:17:58,755
Schrodinger's cat.

326
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,313
Wow, that's brilliant.

327
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,746
You sound surprised.

328
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:11,689
<i>Ho-tsu shway zai li-toe.</i>

329
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,092
Hi.
-Hi.

330
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,556
Come on in.
-Thank you.

331
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:33,848
You look very nice.

332
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:35,872
Thank you.
So do you.

333
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,798
I made an 8:00 reservation.
-Okay, yeah, great.

334
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,039
Listen, um...

335
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,498
maybe we should talk first.

336
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,727
Okay.

337
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,081
But before you
say anything,
