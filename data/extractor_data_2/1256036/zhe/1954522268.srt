Good morning, Leonard.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,580
Yeah. we're gonna have to stop by
Pottery Barn on the way to work.
今天上班路上我们顺便去下陶器坊吧
(PotteryBarn 美国时尚家居购物中心)

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,190
I bought these Star Wars sheets, but
they turned out to be much too stimulating
我买了些星战床单 但实在是望而生畏

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,940
to be compatible with
a good night's sleep.
晚上老是睡不好

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,100
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.
我讨厌达斯・维达那样瞪着我

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,410
I'm not going to work.
我今天不上班

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,800
Oh, just because your career's
been stagnant for a few years,
噢 你的事业不过是停滞了几年时光

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,040
that's no reason to give up.
没理由现在就放弃啊

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,740
Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser
Sheldon 我整晚都在用新自由电子激光仪

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,370
for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
做我的X光衍射实验

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,310
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?
你不小心被激光灼伤了视网膜?

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,170
- No.
- Then you can drive. Let's go.
- 没有
- 那你还是能开车的 走吧

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,510
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
that you'd have to make other arrangements?
我不是已经说了我整晚都在工作
你得自己另行安排嘛

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,130
- You did.
- And?
- 说了呀
- 那还要怎样?

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,200
I didn't.
可我不

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,140
Let's go.
快走吧

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,480
Good night, Sheldon.
晚安 Sheldon

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,090
But how am I going to get to work?
那我要怎么去上班呢?

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
- Take the bus.
- I can't take the bus anymore.
- 坐公车咯
- 我可不能再去坐公车了

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,030
They don't have seat belts, and they won't let
you latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
都没有安全带的说 还不让你用
蹦极绳把自己拴在椅子上

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,630
You tried to latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?
你试过把自己栓椅子上?

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,210
I didn't try. I succeeded.
试算啥 我都成功了呢

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,200
But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
可不知咋的 吓着其他乘客了
然后我就被赶下车了

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,890
Oh, you're a big boy.
You'll figure it out.
你这么大人了 会有办法的

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,070
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
别总拿我当小孩嘛

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,170
Now, take me to return
my Star Wars sheets!
带我去退了那些星战床单啦

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,030
Penny? Penny? Penny?
Penny? Penny? Penny?

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,920
Sheldon. What is it?
Sheldon 什么事?

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,160
Leonard's asleep.
Leonard睡着了

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,740
- Thanks for the update.
- No. Wait.
- 谢谢你的及时报告
- 不 等等

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,710
You have to drive me to work.
你得开车送我去上班

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,470
Yeah, I really don't think I do.
我没这义务吧

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,230
But I don't drive, and
I can't take the bus.
可我不会开车 又不能坐公车

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,020
Honey, you'll be fine as long as you
don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
亲爱的 只要你不干绑蹦极带的傻事
你不会有事的 明白吗?

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,000
Penny.
Penny

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,010
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?
前阵子你不是说我们是朋友么?

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,090
Yes, Sheldon. We are friends.
是啊 Sheldon 我们是朋友

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,930
Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is
an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship.
那我就据此援引下我所理解的
作为友谊誓约必不可少的部分

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,050
The favor.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh, dear God.

interrupting your morning prayers.

You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
Sheldon 今天我可是歇班的

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,580
Oh, good. I'm not
keeping you from anything.
噢 那好哇 我没耽误你什么事

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,750
Your "check engine" light is on.
"检查引擎"的灯亮着呢

50
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,770
Typically that's an indicator
to, you know, check your engine.
基本上 它的意思是要让你 检查引擎

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,710
It's fine. It's been
on for, like, a month.
没事的 都已经亮了有一个月了

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,560
Well, actually, that would
be all the more reason to...
好吧 那这么说来 你就更得去...

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,430
you know, check your engine.
检查一下引擎了

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,150
Sheldon, it's fine.
Sheldon 没事的

55
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,020
If it were fine, the
light wouldn't be on.
要真没事的话 灯干嘛还亮着

56
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,200
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.
生产商装这个指示灯的目的
不就是在出问题的时候提醒你嘛

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,040
Maybe the light's broken.
大概是灯坏了吧

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,100
Is there a "check the
'check engine light' light"?
有没有"检查'检查引擎灯'指示灯"?

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,380
What?
啥?

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,030
Studies have shown that
performing tasks such as eating,
有研究表明 在开车的时候

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,330
talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee
while driving reduces one's reaction time
吃东西 打手机 或者喝咖啡等等
都会对降低人的反应敏捷度

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,790
by the same factor as
an ounce of alcohol.
就和喝了一盎司酒一样

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,540
Do you have any alcohol?
你喝酒了吗?

64
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,380
- Of course not.
- Too bad.
- 当然没有
- 太糟了

65
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,330
You're going up Euclid Avenue?
你要从Euclid大道走?

66
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,040
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
Leonard通常走Los Robles大道

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,910
Well, good for Leonard.
Leonard真行啊

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,670
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the
crow flies, but it has speed bumps,
Euclid大道直线距离是短点
可路上有减速带啊

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,770
which appreciably increase point-to-point
drive time, making it the less efficient choice.
点对点的行车时间就显著增加
这样一来就不算高效了

70
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,150
But you have the conn.
不过方向盘在你手里

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,930
Of course, if you're not going
to slow down fothe speed bumps,
当然 如果你通过减速带时不减速

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,790
I withdraw my previous objection.
我收回我之前的话

73
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,170
Here's a fun question.
问你个有意思的问题

74
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,840
Do you know what the most
common street name is?
你知道最常见的街名是啥吗?

75
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,160
- No.
- The answer's tricky.
- 不知道
- 答案很狡猾噢

76
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,730
It's Second Street.
是第二大街

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,360
You see, you'd think it would be
First Street, but in most towns,
大多数人都会认为是第一大街
但在大多数城里

78
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,650
First Street eventually gets
renamed to something else.
第一大街最终都会被重新命名

79
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,380
You know, like Main
Street, Broad Street.
比方说美茵街 布罗德街

80
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,600
Michigan Avenue.
密歇根大道

81
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,560
See, Leonard and I often use our commute time to
exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that.
看没 我和Leonard总用路上时间
玩玩脑筋急转弯锻炼脑子

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,510
We also play games.
我们还做游戏

83
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,570
- Would you like to play one?
- No.
- 来玩个不?
- 不用了

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,980
Oh, come on. It's fun.
噢 来吧 可有意思呢

85
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,440
Another bump.
又不减速 弹咯

86
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,990
Okay. I'll say an element,
and, and you say an element
好咧 我来说一个元素名
然后 你再说一个

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,710
whose name starts with the last
letter of the one I said, okay?
像接龙一样 首尾字母相接 怎么样?

88
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,870
I'll start.
我先开始

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,990
Helium.
氦(helium)

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,070
Now, you could say "mercury."
你可以接"汞"(mercury)

91
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,920
That would give me a "y." Very
clever. That's a tough one.
我就要用"y"开头 真聪明 这有点难度

92
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,870
So I go with "ytterbium,"
which gets you back to "m."
那我就接"镱"(ytterbium) 你又得用"m"开头了

93
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,070
So you go "molybdenum,"
and I say "magnesium."
那你就接"钼"(molybdenum)
然后我接"镁"(magnesium)

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,680
You say "manganese."
你接"锰"(manganese)

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,730
I say "europium," and, then, you're
left with "mendelevium," and...
我接"铕"(europium) 然后你
就只能接"钔"(Mendelevium) 这样一来...

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,490
there are no more m's because I believe that
meitnerium should still be called ekairidium.
就没有以"m"开头的了
因为我觉得"钔"还是该叫"类铅"(Ekairidium)

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,180
So, congratulations. You win.
恭喜啊 你赢了

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,330
Do you wanna go again?
你想再来一遍吗?

99
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,230
Why don't we just have
a little quiet time now?
你就不能消停一会儿吗

100
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,510
All right.
好吧

101
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,630
I'm sorry.
对不起

102
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding
the check-engine light to be very troubling.
你对"检查引擎"无所谓的冷漠态度
让我感到极度不安

103
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,250
Get out.
下车

104
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,270
Well, I have to tell you that
好吧 我跟你实话实说

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,200
while I do have a theoretical understanding of
the workings of an internal combustion engine,
我的确对内燃引擎的工作原理有所了解

106
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm not sure I'm capable
of performing diagnostics.
可我不确定我是否能进行故障排查

107
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,470
I said, "Get out."
我说"下车"

108
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,290
Okay. I'll give it a shot.
好吧 我来试试好了

109
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,740
Oh, Leonard. There you are.
噢 Leonard 你在这儿啊

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm ready to go home.

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,170
- I just got here.
- Good. Perfect timing.
- 我才刚来
- 太好了 时间算得够准的

112
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,330
Sheldon, I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.
Sheldon 我跟你说过了
我只有晚上才能用自由电子激光仪

113
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,040
I can't drive you for
the next few weeks.
接下来几个礼拜我都不能开车送你了

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,350
No, you said you

Howard, help me out here.

it, I'm gonna take his side.

118
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,070
Now, how do you propose I get home?

119
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,830
How did you get here in the first place?

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,160
Penny.
Penny送我来的

121
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,880
But I sense that's no longer an option.
但我感觉再也不可能了

122
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,660
Look, I need to get to the laser lab.
听着 我现在要去激光实验室

123
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,410
You're just gonna have to find
someone else to take you home.
你就找别人送你回去吧

124
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,230
Ah, damn, I picked the wrong side.

125
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,040
Oh, God, not Euclid Avenue!
噢 天呐 表又走Euclid大道嘛!

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,620
Why did Howard leave you in
the middle of the road anyway?

We had a difference of opinion.

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,270
Over what?
什么事?

129

Whether or not he was trying to kill me.
就他是否打算杀了我这件事

130
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,120

I'm taking you home.

kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.
我从没想过踢爱因斯坦老二

对不起 关于这些问题 我有些疑问

188
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,640
Look at that sign up there.
看看那里的告示

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,590
Yes?

190
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,320

That's because I don't.

193
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,310
Just look. See, this first
question makes no sense.
看一下啦 第一个问题讲不通啊

194
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,120
"How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"
"开车时 你需距前车多少车长"

195
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,500
There's no possible way to answer that.
不可能有答案

196
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,330
A "car length" is not a
standardized unit of measure.
"车长"根本不是标准度量单位

197
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,220
Look at the sign.

Sheldon, it's "C." Just put down "C."

I don't need your help, Penny.

girl, honey. Put "C." Next!

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,300
Sheldon, why are you
arguing with the DMV?
Sheldon 你干嘛要和车管局的争论呢?

203
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,980
How else are they going to learn?
我不吵他们咋学习进步啊?

204
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,140
Look... question two: When
are roadways most slippery?
看... 问题二: 什么时候路道最滑?

205
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,690
Now, okay, there are three
answers, none of which are correct.
瞧 三个答案 全是错的

206
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,660
The correct answer is "when covered by "a film of liquid
sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction"
正解是 当覆盖一层
足够减少摩擦系数的液体

207
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,760
"between the tire and the
road to essentially zero,
在轮胎和路之间达到零始态

208
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,720
but not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."
而这液态膜又不至于成为新的摩擦源

209
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,420
Here's your learner's permit. Go away.
你的驾驶学习许可 快走

210
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,640
But I'm not done. I have many additional
concerns about these questions.
还没说完呢 关于这些问题我还有很多疑问

211
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't make me climb over this counter.

212
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,560

219
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,540

behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
所以我在费卢杰市区
跟在一辆全副武装的悍马后面?

220
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,760
I haven't configured it yet.
还没有完全改成民用程序

police far more often than any other color.

I'm... transcending the situation.

What does that mean?

are significantly smaller than
the average for someone of my size?
要比和我一号的人小很多吗?

you, Sheldon. But not-not that.
你有太多值得纳闷的 Sheldon

cannot master the plebeian task of driving

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,060
Fine. Assuming that
everything you say is true,
好 假定你说的都是真的

how does the biologically superior
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?

Homo novus doesn't know.

Well, hang in there.

something with wings.

Really? Why?

Well, since he won't take the
bus and he's too evolved to drive,
既然他不能做公车

he decided it would be easier
to just sleep in his office

until I'm finished with my experiment.
