1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,964
我和我的哥哥们是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
REBEKAH: My brothers and I
are the first vampires in history.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,231
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,898
三百年前，我们把纽奥良当作家
Three hundred years ago,
we called New Orleans home.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,210
现在一个女巫把我们引回这里
Now, we've returned,
drawn by a witch

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,575
她企图利用我哥哥克劳斯未出生的孩子
who seeks to use my brother
Klaus' unborn child

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,842
作为即将开始的战争中的筹码
as leverage in
a brewing war.

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,613
莎宾，告诉她们你看到了什么？
Sabine, tell them
what you saw.

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,150
这个幻象被如何解读了？
How was this
vision interpreted?

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,315
你的孩子将导致所有女巫死亡
Your baby would bring
death to all witches.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,617
但是对权力的追求
REBEKAH;
But his quest for power

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,421
让兄弟反目
has turned brother
against brother,

12
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,587
使我们的家族更加分裂
Ieaving our family
more divided than ever.

13
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,499
现在以利亚回来了
Now that Elijah has returned,

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,158
我们家族能团结起来面对新的威胁吗？
can our family unite
to face this new threat?

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,100
（毒树）

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,491
你们就这样
度过我们第一次
So this is what you do
the first time we're back together

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,688
一家人重聚的时光吗？
吸血鬼读书俱乐部
as a family.
Vampire book club.

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,033
阅读陶冶心灵，妹妹
Reading edifies the mind, sister.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,758
对吗，以利亚？
Isn't that right, Elijah?

20
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,028
是的，非常正确，尼克劳斯
Yes. That's quite right, Niklaus.

21
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,193
那这又是什么？
And what's this business?

22
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,863
这是求和礼物
This is a peace offering.

23
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,531
我想在棺材里
I presumed,
after so much time

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,836
干枯了那么久之后，我哥哥
desiccating in a coffin,
that my big brother

25
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,639
也许会有些饿了
might be a bit peckish.

26
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,213
所以我向我弟弟解释
So I explained
to my little brother

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,213
宽恕是无法被收买的
that forgiveness cannot be bought.

28
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,646
我真心想看到你行为上的改变
I'd simply prefer to see
a change in behavior

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,549
能够显示出你的悔悟和个人成长
that indicates contrition
and personal growth...

30
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,253
而不是这些没意义的
...not this nonsense.

31
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,189
我也不能白白浪费了她，不是吗？
Well, I couldn't very well
let her go to waste, could l?

32
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,592
我想我得去拿个垃圾桶
Well, I suppose
I'll fetch the rubbish bin

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,757
因为她弄脏了两百年历史的地毯
because she's staining
a 200-year-old carpet.

34
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,735
是啊
Oh, yes.

35
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,499
我对朋友感到愤怒
KLAUS:
"I was angry with my friend.

36
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,381
我说出了愤怒
I told my wrath,

37
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,209
怒气就消了
my wrath did end.

38
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,976
我对敌人感到愤怒
I was angry with my foe.

39
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,217
我没说
I told it not,

40
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,950
怒气越甚
my wrath did grow.

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,395
我日夜以泪水
And I water'd it in fears,

42
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,727
（凶手）

43
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,860
在恐惧中灌溉愤怒
night and morning
with my tears.

44
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,800
用微笑和温柔虚伪的诡计
And I sunned it with smiles,

45
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,603
照耀着愤怒
and with soft deceitful wiles.

46
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,909
愤怒日夜生长
And it grew both
day and night,

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,784
直到结出了一颗鲜亮的苹果
till it bore
an apple bright.

48
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,253
我的敌人见到它的光芒
And my foe beheld it shine,

49
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,290
他知道那属于我
and he knew that it was mine.

50
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,854
当夜慕遮掩了树身
And into my garden stole,

51
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,160
他溜进我的花园来偷苹果
when the night
had veiled the pole.

52
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,031
清晨我高兴地发现
In the morning glad I see

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,939
我的敌人横尸树下
my foe outstretch'd
beneath the tree.

54
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,873
早安
Good morning.

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,377
嘿
Hey.

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,443
听着，我知道我是这个家里
Listen.
I know I'm the only one in this house

57
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,847
唯一一个喝牛奶的人
that actually drinks milk,
but would it kill any of you

58
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,652
但是把它纳入
采购清单不会害死你们吧？
to make sure
it's on the grocery list?

59
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,814
说到采购，加上漂白剂吧
Speaking of, add bleach.

60
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,357
我真心希望我的弟弟妹妹
You know, I do hope
my siblings were

61
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,791
在我不在时有热情招待你
hospitable toward you
in my absence.

62
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,828
“在你不在时”，你要这么形容
In your absence,
as you like to call it,

63
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,192
也未免太客气了
which is a way-too-polite way
of saying

64
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,494
你弟弟把匕首插入了你的心脏
that your brother
put a dagger in your heart.

65
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,572
我被法语区的吸血鬼攻击
I have been attacked
by French Quarter vampires.

66
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,106
我不得不住到一个地下室
I've had to live in a house
with a secret dungeon

67
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,268
装满棺材的屋子
还差点被一群
full of coffins,
and I was nearly murdered by witches

68
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,847
深信我孩子是魔鬼的巫师杀死
who are convinced
that my baby is Lucifer.

69
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,289
牛奶
Milk.

70
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,954
他们一直对我不错
They've been fine.

71
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,364
你的弟弟妹妹奇怪地保护着我
Your sibllings are weirdly protective.

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,091
我知道我得谢谢你
I know I have you
to thank for that.

73
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,736
我很高兴看到你安然无恙
I'm just happy to see
that you're in one piece.

74
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,167
说到那些凶狠的巫师
So, back to the
murderous witches,

75
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,810
我有些担心
I have some concerns.

76
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,743
他们很邪恶，我的性命
They're evil, and my life

77
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,747
还是和苏菲德弗罗连结在一起
is still magically
linked to Sophie Deveraux,

78
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,782
这很令我担忧
which is not comforting.

79
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,887
是的，我想是时候
处理一下这个小问题了
Yes. I think it's time we took
care of that little problem.

80
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,386
我完全同意
REBEKAH: I'm all for it.

81
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,048
一旦她们解除了连结
我们就离开这个鬼地方
As soon as they're unlinked,
we get to leave this crap town.

82
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,959
我们得杀了谁？
Who do we have to kill?

83
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,619
也许谁都不用杀
Probably no one.

84
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,463
好吧，也可能是全得杀
All right.
Potentially everyone.

85
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,637
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：毒树之果

86
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,117
我在那上面做菜，你知道的吧？
I cook on that, you know?

87
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,481
别对我发脾气
主演：约瑟夫摩根
Don't get cranky with me.

88
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,454
我是唯一还喜欢你的女巫
I'm the only witch who still likes you.

89
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,648
是啊，好像我不是在努力
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Yeah. It's not like I'm trying to save

90
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,353
拯救女巫的遗产什么的
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
the witch heritage or anything.

91
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,325
她们会明白的
They'll come around.

92
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,795
她们只是太老派太害怕了
They're just
old-school and scared.

93
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,194
害怕什么？
主演：克莱儿荷特
Scared of what?

94
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,758
你对那个混合种孩子的预言吗？
主演：克莱儿荷特
Your prophecy
about the Hybrid baby?

主演：菲比托金
Agnes and her
freak show minions

96
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,932
在这方面可是很有实力
主演：菲比托金
had a real field day
with that one.

97
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,131
看到什么幻象不是我能决定的
Can't help what I see, Soph.

98
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,607
如果你是灵媒，我就是玛莎史都华了
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Well, if you're psychic,
I'm Martha Stewart. 

99
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,278
让开
Scooch.

100
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,080
搞什…
What the--

101
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,560
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达

from dead trees.

103
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,302
看来某人很担心要做爸爸了
Looks like someone is worried
about impending daddyhood.

104
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,438
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔

105
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,465
胡说，以利亚回来了
Nonsense.
Elijah is back.

106
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,644
有他在，所有的问题
都会变成精灵尘飘走
In his presence, all problems
turn to pixie dust and float away.

107
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,616
奇怪，我不记得最近被迫躺着的
Strange,
I don't recall any pixie dust

108
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,844
黑漆漆棺材里有什么精灵尘
from the darkness of the coffin
I was recently forced to endure.

109
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,654
你拿妈妈的咒语书干什么？
What are you doing with
mother's spell book?

110
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,020
为了换取我的自由
Well, in exchange
for my freedom,

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,219
我答应女巫黛维娜
I promised the witch, Davina,

112
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,126
我会把母亲的魔法书分享几页给她
that I would share a few pages
from mother's grimoire.

113
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,232
这能帮助她学会控制她的魔法
It'll help her learn
to control her magic.

114
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,362
我想我们可以从小小的解除连结咒开始
Thought we'd begin
with a little unlinking spell.

115
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,372
等等，你想利用她解除
Wait.
You want to use her to unlink

116
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,066
海莉和苏菲德弗罗的连结？
Hayley from Sophie Deveraux?

117
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,769
苏菲假借名义把我们骗回这里
Sophie brought us to this town
under false pretenses.

118
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,575
她并不是只想让我们
扳倒马塞尔和他手下
She doesn't just want us to take
down Marcel and his minions.

119
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,344
她想要回黛维娜
制片：兰斯安德森
She wants to take
Davina back.

120
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,183
所以她利用魔法、威胁
和半真半假的话
So she yoked
her own cause to ours

121
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,049
将她的目的和我们的目的结合
with magic, threats,
and half-truths.

122
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,781
一切到此为止
Well, no more.

123
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,624
此刻，我们和苏菲德弗罗的交易
As of now, our deal
with Sophie Deveraux

124
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,159
无效
is null and void.

125
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,358
尼克劳斯，我需要你跟我来
Niklaus, I need you
to come with me.

126
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,828
我需要单独和黛维娜在一起五分钟
I need five minutes
alone with Davina.

127
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,991
你得确保我不会被打断
You need to make certain
that I am not interrupted.

128
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,569
你留在这里照顾海莉
You stay here and watch Hayley.

129
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,673
我怎么成超级保母了？
How did I get
elected Supernanny?

130
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,868
更重要的是，是谁让他主事的？
More importantly,
who put him in charge?

131
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,845
制片：朗恩麦克劳德

132
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,050
一切都还好吧？
Hey, is everything okay?

133
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,922
需要帮你拿点什么吗？
Can I get you something?

134
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,892
我知道你想要一枚日光戒指，孩子
Look. I know you want
a daylight ring, kid.

135
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,328
给你个提示
我手下有比你早80年的还等着呢
Little heads-up,
I got guys 80 years ahead of you.

136
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,968
知道了
抱歉
Noted. Sorry.

137
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,168
等一下
Wait.

138
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,809
编剧：查理察尔邦尼
黛安艾德穆强

139
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,906
你认识克劳斯米卡森
You know Klaus Mikaelson.

140
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,572
有几次我要你送他回去
I asked you to give him
a lift home a couple times

141
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,416
皇宫饭店
导演：麦克艾罗维兹
对吧？
to the Palace Royale Hotel, right?

142
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,047
嗯，对，皇宫饭店
Um, yeah, the Palace Royale.

143
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,057
我去了他的饭店
You see, I stopped by his hotel
to say sorry

144
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,855
想要为我们的争执道歉
about an argument we had.

145
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,362
结果他说谎，他不住在那里
Turns out, he lied
about living there.

146
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,557
说谎了
Lied.

147
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,098
你有没有听过一句话
Did you ever hear the phrase

148
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,931
“为王者难安”?
uneasy is the head
that wears the crown?

149
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,869
“魔戒”吗？
Uh, Lord of the Rings?

150
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,237
不，莎士比亚说的
No. Shakespeare.

151
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,901
在我还是小孩的时候
克劳斯教会我欣赏
When I was a kid,
Klaus taught me how to read

152
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,445
那些戏剧，讲的都是一个国王
with those plays,
always about some king

153
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,482
赢得了天下却失去了灵魂
who gained the world
but lost his soul,

154
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,915
但现在我懂了
but now I get it.

155
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,145
当一切尘埃落定
See, when it's all said and done

156
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,619
看看身边自己建立的帝国
and you look around
at the empire you built,

157
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,281
唯一重要的是你可以信任谁
the only thing that matters
is who you can trust.

158
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,448
一定有你
There's got to be somebody somewhere

159
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,356
能信任的人
that you can trust.

160
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,396
愿意与你同甘共苦
To stick to you
through thick and thin.

161
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,055
坚持到最后的人
To the bitter end.

162
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,326
山姆对佛罗多说的
Sam to Frodo,

163
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,163
“魔戒现身”
Fellowship of the Ring.

164
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,171
确实有
Yeah, there is someone.

165
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,106
我们曾经是最好的朋友
We used to be best friends.

166
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,354
我答应过你的
I made you a promise.

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,191
进来吧
Come in.

168
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,064
宽恕我的罪行，神父
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

169
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,171
已经有…一年了
It's been, oh, a year

170
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,104
我都没有好好和你聊过
since I've had
a good conversation with you.

171
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,505
卡蜜儿
Camille.

172
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,839
你一直躲着我，基叔叔
You've been avoiding me, Uncle K.

173
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,381
躲着我最爱的侄女？绝对不会
My favorite niece?
Never.

174
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,179
别说谎，这可是教堂
Don't lie.
This is a church.

175
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,516
再说，我是来寻求专业建议的
Besides, I came about
professional advice.

176
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,057
是有关西恩的
About Sean.

177
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,933
解结咒？
The Spell of Unknotting?

178
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,160
这是一个血结
This is a sanguinem knot.

179
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,567
女巫将其看作代表性的魔法
The witches use it
as representational magic.

180
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,764
如果你能用这个咒语解开这团绳子
If you can unknot this
rope using that spell,

181
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,034
你就向控制魔法
you'll have taken

182
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,177
迈了一大步
an important step towards control.

183
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,677
这是我母亲后期的咒语之一
This is one of my
mother's later spells.

184
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,283
需要的力量远超出你的想像
Requires much more power
than you realize.

185
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,578
如果你能完成这个
If you can perform this,

186
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,119
我会再带一页来
I shall return with another page.

187
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,258
下一次就是你选的咒语了
A spell of your
choosing next time.

188
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,625
因为我是个受虐狂
Apparently,
because I'm a masochist,

189
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,359
今天我去了西恩的坟墓…
I went by Sean's grave today, and--

190
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,505
该死
我本想在你看见前清理干净的
Damn it.
I was hoping to get that
cleaned up before you saw it.

191
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,162
希望没有让你太难过
I hope it didn't
upset you too much.

192
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,037
一点都没有让我烦心
It didn't bother me at all.

193
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,144
这就是问题，我就是为这来的
That's the problem.
That's why I'm here.

194
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,212
这周来我每晚都睡得很香
I've slept like a baby
every night this week,

195
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,110
即使是我的双胞胎哥哥就在
even though
my twin brother hacked

196
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,308
离这告解室不到两英尺的地方
nine priests to death

197
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,918
砍死了九名牧师
not two feet from this confessional.

198
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,285
我最近约会的那个人，马赛尔
A guy I've been seeing, Marcel,

199
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,948
也不怎么理我了
has been blowing me off.

200
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,787
管他呢，我只不过和他约过两次会
Whatever. I've gone on
two dates with the guy,

201
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,929
比起看到我哥哥坟墓上
and I'm more upset about that

202
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,861
被人涂写着“凶手”
than seeing "murderer"

203
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,593
我更为此感到失落
scrawled across my brother's grave.

204
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,761
这就叫做治愈，卡蜜
It's called healing, Cami.

205
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,373
大屠杀后的几个月
For months after the massacre,

206
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,805
我满脑子都是这件事
I couldn't think of anything else,

207
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,641
然后突然间，都消失了
and then suddenly, nothing.

208
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:54,252
我需要感觉到痛苦
I need to feel that pain.

209
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,255
没有那痛苦，我感觉破碎，空虚
Without it,
I feel broken, empty,

210
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,519
就像是该怪谁
Iike there's someone to blame

211
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:06,028
而我却让他们逃脱了
and I'm letting them
get away with it.

212
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,825
听着，如果你找到了
Listen.
If you have found a way

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,833
忘记的办法
不要质疑它
to turn it off,
don't question it.

214
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,868
唯一需要对西恩行为负责的
The only person
that is responsible

215
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,306
就是他自己
for Sean's behavior is Sean.

216
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,270
你真的这么认为吗？
Do you really believe that?

217
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,209
是的
Yes.

218
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,678
我是这么认为
I do.

219
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,566
放开我
Let go of me.

220
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,730
放开她
Leave her be.

221
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,411
杀了我来抓住克劳斯或是他的孩子
Killing me to get
to Klaus or his baby

222
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,172
不是解决办法
is not the answer.

223
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,679
我不会杀了你的，苏菲
I'm not gonna kill you, Sophie.

224
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,841
你出生的那天我也在场
I was there
the day you were born.

225
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,146
我是我们女巫族群最后的长老
I'm the last remaining elder
of our coven.

226
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,222
保护我们的力量是我的职责
It is my duty
to protect our power,

227
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,555
如果有天那个孩子出生
我们的力量就不算什么了
and our power means nothing
if that baby grows another day.

228
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,596
莎宾的预兆很明显了
Sabine's omen was clear.

229
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,757
那个孩子会让我们都死去
That baby will bring
death to us all.

230
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,061
你打算怎么做？
What are you gonna do?

231
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,238
天啊，不
不，爱格妮丝，不要
Oh, God, no.
No. Agnes, no.

232
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,771
不，不要，不要…
No. No!
Don't do this--

233
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,711
怎么了？
What the hell was that?

234
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,148
我哪知道
Hell if I know.

235
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,312
我感觉被刺了一下
It felt like I was being stabbed.

236
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,453
发生什么事了？
What happened?

237
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,160
是爱格妮丝
It was Agnes.

238
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,594
她的人带走了苏菲
Her men took Sophie.

239
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,999
你主事的第一天，哥哥
Day one with you in charge, brother,

240
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,798
那个和海莉连结的女巫
and already the witch link
to Hayley

241
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,305
已经被狂热份子劫走了
has been abducted by zealots.

242
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,669
她在哪？
Where is she?

243
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,936
如果我告诉你们爱格妮丝在哪
你们会杀了她的
If I tell you where Agnes is,
you'll just kill her.

244
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,306
有那么明显吗？
Is it that obvious?

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,471
听着，我知道她有点疯在
Look.
I know she's a little cuckoo...

246
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,015
但她是我们最后一个在世的长老了
...but she's our last living elder.

247
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,311
这也许对你们来说没什么
That might not mean
a lot to you,

248
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,475
但对我们来说却很重要
but it means plenty to us.

249
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,384
只有长老才能施重要的咒语
The elders are the only ones
who can do important spells.

250
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,821
比如完成收获祭仪式
Like completing the Harvest ritual.

251
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,688
你知道那事？
You know about that?

252
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,659
我知道的事情会让你瞠目结舌的
Oh, you'd be astounded
by the things I know.

253
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,696
请允许我按事情的重要性
Allow me to entertain you

254
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,766
一一为你说明
with today's list of priorities.

255
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,994
第一解除你朋友苏菲的连结
One, unlink your friend Sophie

256
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,695
这样她就再也不能控制
so she no longer controls the fate

257
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,362
怀着我孩子那女人的命运了
of the woman carrying my child.

258
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,338
第二、说服我哥哥接受
Two, convince
my brother to accept

259
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,703
我为最近冒险的行为
my heartfelt apologies

260
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,936
真心的道歉
for some recently dodgy behavior.

261
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,775
第三…没有第三
Three, there is no three.

262
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,008
我相信我弟弟想表达的是
I believe what my brother is
attempting to communicate here

263
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,050
你们长老的性命
is that neither the life
of this elder,

264
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,778
收获祭仪式以及你们女巫
nor the Harvest ritual,
nor your coven's connection to magic

265
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,687
与魔法的联系
都与他无关
are of any relevance to him whatsoever.

266
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,960
说吧
Now talk.

267
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,069
提艾里
Thierry.

268
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,803
马赛尔
Marcel.

269
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,311
又来惩罚我吗？
Come to punish me again?

270
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,743
有人问我，有没有
Someone asked
if there's anyone

271
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,076
我一直信任的人
I ever trusted.

272
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,344
我只想到了一个名字
I only came up with one name.

273
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,884
就是你
You.

274
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,893
所以，提艾里
我们俩需要聊一下
So, Thierry, you and l
are gonna have a little talk.

275
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,194
是有关克劳斯米卡森
About Klaus Mikaelson.

276
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,596
恶魔宝宝吃点心的时间到了
REBEKAH: It's time for
the demon spawn to snack.

277
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,672
我真心希望你别这样叫她
I really wish you
wouldn't call her that.

278
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,741
抱歉，你想好别的名字了吗？
I'm sorry.
Have you picked another name yet?

279
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,402
拿一个
种植园里多的是
Take one. The plantation
is lousy with them.

280
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,070
脖子怎么样了？
How's your neck?

281
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,446
感觉没事，好奇怪
I feel fine,
which is weird.

282
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,780
我确定这和苏菲有关
I'm sure this is Sophie-related.

283
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,751
帮我个忙，别在我的看顾下死了
Well, do me a favor
and don't die on my watch.

284
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,083
不然我耳根就别想清净了
I'll never hear the end of it.

285
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,350
我第一次见到你的时候
You know, when l
first met you,

286
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,584
我觉得你真是个贱人
I thought you
were a real bitch.

287
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,887
是什么让你改变了想法？
What changed your mind?

288
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,689
我还是觉得你是个贱人
Oh, I still think
you're a bitch.

289
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,764
只是我开始喜欢你这点了
I've just grown
to like that about you.

290
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,466
你这么说真好啊
Well, that's sweet
of you to say.

291
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,968
我走后你也要记着
Remember it when I'm gone.

292
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,107
走？你要去哪？
Gone?
Where are you going?

293
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,367
我来这里只是为了确保
I only came to town to make sure

294
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,772
以利亚一切都好
everything was okay with Elijah.

295
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,936
他没事，他还没有惩罚克劳斯
He's fine,
and he hasn't punished Klaus

296
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,378
用匕首封住他
所以，一如既往
for daggering him,
so, as usual,

297
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,675
他们会非常亲密的
they'll be thick as thieves,

298
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,115
而我会被留下来收拾烂摊子
and I'll be left
to clean up the mess.

299
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,848
是时候我该开溜了
It's time for me to fly the coop.

300
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,430
怎么了？
What's wrong?

301
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,227
我不知道
I don't know.

302
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,495
大概是害喜吧
Probably morning sickness.

303
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,400
事实上你发烧了
Oh, you're burning up, actually.

304
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,474
爱格妮丝用一根针刺了我
(GROANS)
Agnes stuck me with a needle.

305
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,013
这东西很久以前被下了咒
(CONTlNUES GRUNTlNG)
Cursed objects
were created a long time ago.

306
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,649
我们利用它们，这样我们使用魔法
We use them so we don't get busted

307
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,478
就不会被马赛尔发现
by Marcel for doing magic.

308
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,950
她用的那个叫做哀伤之针
The one she used is called
the Needle of Sorrows.

309
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,554
是在1860年被下咒…
It was cursed in 1860, when--

310
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,283
跳过那些陈年琐事
告诉我们它有什么作用，亲爱的
Jump ahead a few decades
and tell us what it does, love.

311
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,926
它只有一个作用
It has one purpose.

312
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,962
升高她的血液温度以杀掉她肚里的孩子
To kill a child in utero
by raising her blood temperature.

313
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,193
为了让她流产
It's for a miscarriage.

314
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,769
我们还有多少挽救的时间？
So how much time do
we have to fix this?

315
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,634
今晚涨潮时这个东西
就会发挥它应有的作用
It'll do what it's meant to
by tonight's high tide.

316
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,708
相信我，这绝对有效
And, believe me,
It will work.

317
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,174
我曾见她在一个小孩身上用过
类似的东西让他发疯
I saw her use a similar object
on a kid who went mad

318
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,211
并杀掉了一群牧师
and killed a bunch of priests.

319
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,180
我想和这个爱格妮丝聊聊
I'd like to have a little chat
with this Agnes.

320
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,183
在哪能找到她？
Where can I find her?

321
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,844
你找不到的
You won't.

322
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,183
她有无数的藏身之处来等待事情结束
There are a thousand places
she could hole up to wait it out.

323
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,122
这正是我们为什么要解除
你与海莉的连结
That's precisely why we need
to unlink you from Hayley,

324
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,524
不能再让她或孩子受到伤害
no more danger
towards her or the child.

325
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,855
不，什么？
No. What?

326
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,693
如果我失去了跟海莉的连结
If I am not linked to Hayley,

327
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,664
我就没有任何筹码了
I lose my leverage on you.

328
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,269
我们做了交易的
We had a deal.

329
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,429
我们可不是同一阵营的，苏菲德弗罗
We are not on the same side,
Sophie Deveraux.

330
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,734
我们的交易不再有效了
Our deal no longer stands.

331
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,174
这意味着你要赦免我吗？
Does this mean
you're pardoning me?

332
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,112
你知道我不能那样做
Aw, you know I can't do that.

333
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,047
你违反了我最重要的规矩
You broke my number-one rule.

334
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,414
你杀了一个吸血鬼，小提
You killed a vampire, T.

335
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,421
如果就这么算了，会显得我很软弱
I let that go,
it'll make me look weak.

336
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,357
我早就警告你小心克劳斯了
I warned you about Klaus.

337
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,496
是啊，我该听你的
Yeah.
I should've listened.

338
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,563
这家伙来到我的地盘几个月了
This guy has been
in my town for months

339
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,326
却不让人知道他落脚的地方
but hiding where
he lays his head at night.

340
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,663
我想知道他还隐瞒了些什么
What else is he hiding
is what I want to know.

341
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,067
之前我没有听你的
I didn't listen to you before,

342
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,707
但我现在一定会相信你
but I sure as hell am now.

343
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,276
告诉我那晚到底发生了什么事
Tell me about the night
that got you put in here,

344
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,782
狂欢节的时候说不定你就能出去了
and you might find yourself
out by Mardi Gras.

345
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,951
化装舞会那天晚上
The night of the
masquerade party,

346
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,557
你派我们去女巫那
you sent us rousting
in the Cauldron

347
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,853
骚扰她们
to mess with the witches.

348
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,427
当麦克斯过去时
So when Max came in rousting,

349
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,927
他直接咬了凯蒂的喉咙
he went right for Katie's throat.

350
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,397
你只是说骚扰，没说杀人
Now, you said to roust.
You didn't say to kill.

351
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,093
他是夜行者，而我是日行者
Now, he's a Nightwalker.
I'm a Daywalker.

352
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,069
我叫他住手，但他不听
I told him to stop,
and he wouldn't.

353
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,902
所以我制止了他
So, I stopped him.

354
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,138
那晚的事不断在我脑海中浮现
That night is on an
endless loop in my head.

355
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,044
我想麦克斯可能被魅惑了
I think Max was compelled.

356
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,583
不可能，我的手下体内都有马鞭草
No.
All my guys are on vervain.

357
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,313
如果克劳斯放了他们的血就没有了
Not if Klaus drained them.

358
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,956
麦克斯在骚扰行动前
Max went missing
for a couple of days

359
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,785
失踪了好几天，不是吗？
before the rousting, right?

360
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,290
小提，他们在你女友的店里
T, they found stuff you and your girl

361
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,621
搜到了你们从我这偷走的东西
stole from me in her shop.

362
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,990
你去过灰色花园吗？
Have you ever been
to the Jardin Gris?

363
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,324
那里的商品眼花缭乱的
You can't find your own hand

364
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,831
你根本不可能轻易发现什么
in front of you face in there,

365
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,969
尽管如此，有人进去
and yet somehow
someone went in there,

366
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,297
只过了短短几分钟
and after a couple of minutes,

367
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,839
就找到了失窃的物品？
they found some stolen goods?

368
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,811
不信你自己去那看看
Go there, see for yourself...

369
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,174
但我告诉你，除了麦克斯
...but I'm telling you,
besides Max,

370
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,013
你的人里一定还有别人
somebody else in the crew

371
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,950
被魅惑了
had to be compelled.

372
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,088
小心自己人
Watch your back.

373
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,830
几个游客失踪，没问题
So a few tourists go missing, okay.

374
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,830
我们能掩饰过去，不是难事
We can spin it, no problem,

375
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,798
但你知道对市议会讲什么
but do you know
how hard it is to sell

376
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,801
瓦斯泄漏有多牵强吗
a gas-leak story
to the city council

377
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,530
尤其当教堂一大片窗户这样
when a bunch
of church windows

378
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,140
神秘地爆炸？
 magically explode?

379
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,468
别这样，市长先生
Come on, Mr. Mayor.

380
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,736
你当这是竞选办论吗？
What is this,
an electoral debate?

381
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,403
马赛尔越权了，我会对付他
Marcel overstepped.
I will handle it.

382
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,072
说得倒轻松
Easier said than done.

383
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,741
马赛尔可不是那么好对付的
Marcel is quite
the little warrior. Ah-ah.

384
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,515
你是哪位？
Who the hell are you?

385
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,680
我叫克劳斯
My name is Klaus,

386
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,658
你们就是那群
and you lot are the Faction.

387
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,592
维系着城市超自然生物平衡的
Pillars of the community
who maintain

388
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,959
社区中的栋梁者吧
the city's supernatural balance.

389
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,828
我该知道的
Well, I should know.

390
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,493
我创立了这个组织，只不过在我那时
I created this group.
Only in my day,

391
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,266
全是一帮海盗和腐败的政客
it was a bunch of pirates
and corrupt politicians.

392
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,275
看起来一点都没变啊
Looks like nothing's changed.

393
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,706
有一件事变了
One thing has.

394
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,005
现在只接受人类
It's exclusively human now.

395
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,207
吸血鬼不准加入，尤其是真祖
No vampires allowed,
especially no Originals.

396
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,876
我不是要来加入的
(MOCKlNG LAUGH)
I haven't come to join.

397
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,715
我是来请你们动用
I've come to ask this group

398
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,618
你们丰富的资源
to utilize it's considerable resources

399
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,022
去找一个叫爱格妮丝的女巫长老
to find a witch elder named Agnes.

400
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,425
我只需要一个地址
All I need is an address.

401
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,792
为什么我们要帮你？
And why would we want to help you?

402
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,365
如果我告诉你爱格妮丝
What if I told you that Agnes

403
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,899
能解开
was the answer to a question

404
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,003
自你逃离这个城市后
you've been asking since
you ran screaming

405
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,469
一直想解答的疑问
from this town?

406
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,871
她就是对你侄子西恩
That she is the witch

407
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,808
下咒的女巫呢？
who hexed your nephew, Sean?

408
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,419
我们需要点时间讨论…
We'd need some time to discuss--

409
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,182
我没有时间
I don't have time!

410
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,527
我也不喜欢别人叫我等待
Nor do I like being asked to wait.

411
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,229
或许你可以吓唬住
You may have all the vampires

412
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,232
这个城市所有的吸血鬼
in this town
cowering in fear,

413
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,166
但现在你是在跟人类打交道
but right now,
you are dealing with the humans,

414
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,240
除非你打算杀掉我们所有人
and unless you plan on
killing all of us,

415
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,844
不然我建议你照我的话做
I politely suggest you do
as I say,

416
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,004
给我们时间讨论一下
and give us time to discuss it.

417
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,020
你知道我欣赏你什么吗，神父？
You know,
what I like about you, Father,

418
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,123
就是你明知道我的名声
is, you're aware of my reputation

419
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,624
却仍然无惧与我作对
and yet still
you stand tall against me.

420
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,295
我很敬佩
It's admirable.

421
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,898
你有一小时
You have one hour.

422
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,435
找到那个女巫
Track down that witch.

423
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,439
通话记录什么的，九区有我们的人
Cell phone records,
our guys in the Ninth.

424
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,873
为了那个吸血鬼吗？
For the vampire?

425
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,707
不，是为了我
No, for me.

426
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,368
不要烦躁，好吗？
以利亚马上就回来
Stop fussing, will you?
Elijah will be here any minute.

427
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,733
我觉得好像被放进了微波炉一样
I feel like
I've been microwaved.

428
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,068
就算你怀着孩子
Hey, just because
you're carrying a baby

429
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,801
也不代表你就能像个孩子一样任性
doesn't mean you get
to act like one.

430
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,070
我想我的小侄女一定已经在治疗你了
I'm sure my little niece
is healing you up as we speak.

431
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,842
她来这里做什么？
What the hell
is she doing here?

432
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,851
- 我想帮忙
- 帮忙？
-I'm trying to help.
-Help?

433
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,455
你正是让我们陷入这一切的罪魁祸首
You're the reason
we're in this bloody mess.

434
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,058
为什么我们还没
跟这女巫解除连结呢，以利亚？
Why aren't we unlinked with
this witch already, Elijah?

435
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,956
蕾贝卡，让她试试
Rebekah, let her do what she can.

436
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,597
我或许有种方法能退烧
I may know a way
to slow the fever down,

437
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,392
但我需要一些特殊的草药
but I'm gonna need
some special herbs.

438
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,228
我会用简讯传个清单给你
I'll text you a list.

439
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,300
好吧，很乐意为你们跑腿
Fine.
Happy to play the fetch girl.

440
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,456
这不是凯蒂的店吗？
Isn't this Katie's shop?

441
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,189
她在遗嘱里把钥匙留给了你
She leave you the keys in her will,

442
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,732
还是今天是自助购物日呢？
or maybe it's just
help yourself Tuesday?

443
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,835
你来这做什么？
What are you doing here?

444
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,971
我听说如果将艾草与鼠尾草混合在一起
You know, I read that
if you mix mugwort with sage,

445
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,800
就能得到一种强力的驱吸血鬼药
you've got quite
the vampire repellant,

446
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,670
就算对最顽固的那种也有效
wards off even
the most resilient pest.

447
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,106
你又为什么来这里？
Why are you here?

448
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,644
保护我的城市免受小偷和流氓的破坏
Just keeping my city safe
from thieves and vandals,

449
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,339
但每当我稍微松懈时
总有一个真祖
but every time I turn around,
I catch an Original

450
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,815
被我抓个正着
with their hand in the cookie jar.

451
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,921
那算你走运了
Well, luckily for you,
your cookies...

452
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,954
我对你一点兴趣都没有
...are the last thing
on my mind.

453
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,026
我知道
但我记得
Oh, I can see that.
Though I remember

454
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,686
以前似乎并不是这样
a time when things were different.

455
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:24,461
或许有那么一次
但不会再发生了
Maybe once.
Not anymore.

456
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,467
樟脑，找到了
Camphor.
Found it.

457
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,476
（下九区夏博内街3631号）

458
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,888
要出去吗？
Going somewhere?

459
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,189
你来早了
You're early.

460
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,092
还好我来得早
Well, it's a good thing I am.

461
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,890
看起来你正准备独自一人
You seem hell-bent
on enacting vengeance

462
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,057
去实施你的复仇大计
all on your lonesome.

463
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,571
问题是，在你送爱格妮丝
The trouble is,
I need something

464
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,400
去见上帝之前
from Agnes before you send her off

465
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,804
我要从她手上拿点东西
to meet her maker.

466
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:10,380
我提议我们来做个交易
So, I propose we strike a deal.

467
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,714
把她带来
Bring her here.

468
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,080
作为交换，我会保证
In exchange,
I'll even ensure your niece...

469
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:21,248
你的侄女卡蜜的安全
...Cami, remains safe.

470
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,930
我真不愿将她
I would so hate for her

471
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,588
卷进这一切
to get caught up in all this.

472
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,406
太过分了
我犯了什么罪？
This is outrageous.
What's the charge?

473
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,208
别装了，爱格妮丝
Please, Agnes.

474
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,040
你知道马赛尔统治着这个城市的吸血鬼
You know that Marcel runs
the vampires in this town.

475
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,545
你觉得是谁在控制其他的一切呢？
Who do you think
runs everything else?

476
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,558
我想这就是你要找的东西
I believe this is what
you're looking for.

477
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,920
你好，爱格妮丝
Hello, Agnes.

478
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,755
你竟然和他做交易？
You made a deal with him?

479
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,489
你竟然狠心对西恩痛下毒手
After what you did to Sean,

480
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,635
即使是与魔鬼做交易
我也要让你受尽折磨
I'd deal with the devil himself
just to see you suffer.

481
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,827
你不能伤害我
You can't hurt me.

482
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,995
所有的女巫都不会放过你的
The entire witch community
will turn against you.

483
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,868
够了！
Enough!

484
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,908
拜托，够了
Please. Enough.

485
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,240
我不在乎你们女巫的权术
I don't care about witch politics.

486
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,382
我也不在乎你们那荒诞的
I don't care about
your ridiculous,

487
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,074
收获祭仪式
 little Harvest ritual.

488
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,312
我在乎的是这个小玩意
What I care about is this trinket.

489
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:29,822
解除诅咒，否则我会让你比死更难受
Undo its curse, or I'll show you
things worse than death.

490
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,530
黑暗魔物可没有解除装置
Dark objects don't come
with an off switch.

491
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,758
诅咒下在苏菲身上
The curse took root in Sophie.

492
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,597
她和你的恶魔之子连结在一起
She's linked to your devil child.

493
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,132
诅咒生效只是时间的问题
It's just a matter of time.

494
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,576
她体温越来越高，我们得马上开始
She's burning up.
We need to do this now.

495
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,237
把她放进水里
Get her in the water.

496
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,214
我不明白午夜游泳会有什么帮助
I don't see how a midnight swim
is supposed to help.

497
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,478
她的体温极高
Her temperature is sky high,

498
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,383
水再加上草药
and the water,
with the help of the herbs,

499
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,921
应该能把体温降下来
should cool us down.

500
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:00,980
喝下去
Drink this.

501
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,956
你要让她的心跳慢下来
You're gonna have to get
her heart rate down.

502
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,254
那我该怎么做？
And how do you suggest I do that?

503
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,418
抱住她
Hold her.

504
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,892
为自救使心跳变慢以及降低血压
It's a natural human remedy
to slow the heart beating

505
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,225
是人类的本能
and reduce blood pressure.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,563
- 这绝对行不通
- 黛维娜会打破这连结
-This is never gonna work.
-Davina will break that link.

507
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,567
我们只需要一点时间
We just need time.

508
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,534
我不能呼吸了
Oh, I can't breathe.

509
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,397
没事的，深呼吸
Okay.
Take long, deep breaths.

510
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,164
海莉，看着我，深呼吸
Hayley, look at me.
Long, deep breaths.

511
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,968
把注意力集中在我的声音上
Just focus on the
sound of my voice.

512
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,070
你会没事的，你会没事的
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.

513
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,946
我感觉到连结被消除了
I just felt it lift.

514
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,246
来，上去吧
Come on. Let's go.

515
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,674
以利亚
Elijah.

516
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,647
一旦你弟弟发现
As soon as your brother finds out

517
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,982
连结被打破了
that the link is broken,

518
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,818
他一定会杀了爱格妮丝
he'll kill Agnes.

519
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,789
我知道你不欠我什么
I know you don't owe me anything,

520
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,761
但求你别让他杀了她
but please don't let him kill her.

521
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,630
以利亚，她是我们
Elijah, she's our only access

522
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,772
与生存所需的力量间唯一的桥梁
to the power we need to survive.

523
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,271
答应我你会阻止他
Promise me that you'll stop him.

524
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,608
是我，你在哪？
It's me.
Where are you?

525
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,909
别伤害她，我马上过去
Don't hurt her.
I'll be there shortly.

526
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,521
我答应你最后一件事
I'll make you one last promise.

527
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,850
我不会让我弟弟杀了爱格妮丝
I won't let my brother kill Agnes.

528
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,270
我知道你只是利用我来拯救你的族人
I know you were just
using me to save your people...

529
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,700
但若再有下次，我会杀了你
...but try it again, I'll kill you.

530
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,286
连结解除了
The unlinking worked.

531
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,292
- 也许现在我们可以计划…
- 现在不行，蕾贝卡
-Maybe now we can make plans--
-Not now, Rebekah.

532
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:29,160
- 这事能等我回来再谈吗？
- 你回来的时候我就不在了
-Can we discuss this when I return?
-I won't be here when you return.

533
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,128
这听起来像是告别
That sounds like a goodbye.

534
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,665
就是告别
I guess it is.

535
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,910
我来纽奥良只是为了确保你的安全
I only came to New Orleans
to make sure you were safe.

536
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,838
你现在安全了
You are.

537
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,408
我本来以为我能
I thought that I might be able

538
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,610
说服你跟我一起走
to convince you
to come with me, but...

539
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,187
但你却急着投身于
...here you are, rushing off

540
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,256
克劳斯、马赛尔
into whatever Klaus and Marcel

541
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,891
和女巫们的阴谋诡计中
and the witches have cooked up...

542
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,889
我终于明白
...and I finally get it.

543
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,362
你永远不会离开这城市
You'll never leave this city.

544
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,332
你永远不会离开克劳斯
You'll never leave Klaus.

545
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,739
那你就该留下
Then you should stay.

546
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,010
你和克劳斯还有马赛尔间的纠缠
This thing that you
and Klaus and Marcel have,

547
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,909
我不想扯上关系
I want no part of it.

548
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,219
我只想自由自在地生活
I just want to be free.

549
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,378
那就去吧
Well, then go.

550
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,362
你是自由的
You are free.

551
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,376
蕾贝卡
Rebekah.

552
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,212
一晚见面两次
Twice in one night.

553
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,684
我简直是太荣幸了
To what do I owe the pleasure?

554
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,855
也许是我的作风老派
但我认为
Call me old-fashioned,
but I believe

555
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,925
告别还是亲自来的好
farewells are best in person.

556
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,426
你救回了以利亚，现在你们俩
Got Elijah back,
and now you're both

557
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,498
要夹着尾巴逃跑了
gonna tuck tail and run.

558
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,427
聪明啊
Smart girl.

559
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,764
祝你幸福
Have a nice life.

560
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,701
他要留下来，我的离开也并非逃跑
He's staying,
and I'm not running.

561
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,341
我只是在沉船前趁早脱身
I'm disembarking a sinking ship.

562
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,805
我还是孩子时，人们就一直在说
People been saying the city

563
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,274
这城市会没落
has been sinking since I was a boy.

564
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,912
如今依旧欣欣向荣
It ain't going anywhere.

565
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:28,018
嘿，临别前来喝一杯怎么样？
But, hey, how about one
for the road?

566
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,521
怎么，你想把我灌醉
Why, so you can liquor me up

567
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,623
然后说服我留下来吗？
and convince me to stay?

568
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,558
若非如此，你为什么要来？
Why else did you come here?

569
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,662
我是来说再见的
I came to say goodbye.

570
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,836
那就说吧
Then say it.

571
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,608
终于解脱了
(WHlSPERS) Good riddance.

572
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,807
你是个狠角色，爱格妮丝
You're a piece of work, Agnes...

573
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,680
但你知道吗？
...but guess what?

574
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,253
我也不是好惹的
I'm quite a piece of work myself.

575
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,950
你知道吗，我打算以你的残骸
You know, I contemplated
leaving bits of you

576
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,095
装饰你家族的墓园
artfully arranged
outside your family's tomb.

577
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,359
我想这下总该能杀鸡做猴了
I thought it would leave
a fitting message.

578
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,697
不许伤害我的家人
-(GASPS)
-Don't touch my family.

579
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,098
放开她
ELlJAH: Leave her!

580
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,672
我许下了承诺
I gave my word.

581
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,277
你许下诺言的时机
You tend to give your word

582
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,541
总是如此不合时宜，哥哥
at the most inopportune times, brother.

583
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,452
今天所有人一直照你的指示行动
We've been doing things
your way all day.

584
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,711
来嘛
Come on.

585
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,754
轻轻一扭就能把爱格妮丝送上西天
Just one little snap,
and it's toodle-oo, Agnes.

586
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,323
这是她罪有应得
She deserves it.

587
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,619
尼克劳斯，别轻举妄动
Niklaus, do not make another move.

588
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,957
你想要我的原谅
You have asked for my forgiveness.

589
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,000
我可以原谅你
I will grant you that forgiveness...

590
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,469
但不要让我违背诺言
...but do not make me
break my word.

591
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,721
我高尚的哥哥
My noble brother.

592
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,151
这算是显着的成长吧？
How's that for personal growth, eh?

593
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,295
你还是一如既往地爱扫我的兴
Still, it is just like you
to spoil my fun.

594
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,698
这可不一定
Oh, not necessarily.

595
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,243
我许下的诺言是
You know,
I swore you would not die

596
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,081
你不会死在我弟弟手上
by my brother's hand.

597
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,650
我可没说过
I said nothing...

598
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,191
你不会死在我手上
...of my own.

599
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,226
没人在伤害我的家人后能安然无恙
No one hurts my family and lives.

600
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,496
谁都不能
No one.

601
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,623
我离开这里快一百年了
I've been away from this home
almost 100 years,

602
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,128
你居然让我的房间保留原样，丝毫未变
and you haven't changed
a thing in my bedroom.

603
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,758
我想我也许是为了等你回来
I guess I was holding out
hope that you'd come back to it.

604
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,232
但这里的床应该没有
Although I imagine
it's not quite as comfortable

605
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,806
皇宫饭店来得舒服吧
as those beds at the Palace Royale.

606
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,707
怎么会，这床很舒服
It's plenty comfortable.

607
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,837
我饿了
I'm famished.

608
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,649
我不喜欢吃苹果
Nah.
Apples aren't my thing.

609
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,449
这曾经是你的最爱
They were your favorite
once upon a time.

610
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,750
是的，曾经是
Yeah. They were.

611
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,119
我在种植园干活时
Get my ass beat
if I ever ate them

612
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,453
若敢偷吃苹果会被打个半死
working on that plantation,

613
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,391
即使是腐坏的也不例外
even the spoiled ones.

614
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,328
现在它们只会让我想起
Now they just
remind me of a time

615
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,127
我一无所有的日子
when I couldn't have things.

616
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,531
如今你能获得想要的一切
Well, now you can have
whatever you want.

617
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,865
跟我一起走
Come with me.

618
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,202
跟你去哪，蕾贝卡？
And go where, Rebekah?

619
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,004
去任何我们想去的地方
Wherever we want to.

620
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,544
我们可以共组家庭
We can build a home together.

621
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,842
把克劳斯、这座城市
We can leave behind
Klaus and this city

622
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,008
还有那些孤儿般的吸血鬼都抛诸脑后
and those Orphan Annie vampires.

623
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,814
那些孤儿般的吸血鬼是我的家人
Whoa, those Orphan Annie
vampires are my family,

624
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,978
这座城市是我的家园
and this city is my home.

625
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,887
这也曾是我的家园
我离开了
It was my home, too, once.
I left.

626
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,085
你逃离了，我留下了
You ran. I stayed.

627
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,855
这个帝国因我而兴盛
This empire,
it thrives because of me,

628
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,330
你却想让我弃它而去
and you want me to run.

629
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,095
人不会逃离自己的家
A man does not run from his home.

630
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,671
我比你活得久得多，马赛勒斯
I have lived a lot longer
than you, Marcellus.

631
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,968
我见证过王朝的兴衰
I have seen kings rise and fall.

632
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,642
我只确定一件事
If there is one thing
I know to be true,

633
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,609
那就是不论你的帝国有多庞大
it is that no matter how
big your empire becomes,

634
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,681
若无人与你分享
it is nothing

635
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,045
那些都是虚无
if you have no one
to share it with.

636
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:35,285
你想要纽奥良
那就拿去
You want New Orleans,
have it.

637
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,093
我不会阻止你
I won't be here to stop you.

638
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,607
他在哪？我找了他一整天了
Where is he?
I've been trying to find him all day.

639
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,379
马赛尔知道尼克劳斯
没有告诉他真实的住处
Marcel knows that Klaus
lied about where he lives.

640
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,749
我可不是他的监护人，小约
I'm not his damn keeper, Josh.

641
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,222
好吧，那就叫他打个电话给我，拜托了
Fine.
Just tell him to call me, please.

642
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,892
好吧
Okay.

643
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,148
想怎样啊，小约？
(GROANS) What the hell, Josh?

644
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,023
你好
Hi, there.

645
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,828
我是马赛尔
I'm Marcel.

646
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,628
我们好像没见过
I don't think we've met.

647
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,671
你来这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

648
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,932
记得我对你的承诺吗？
Do you remember
the promise I made you?

649
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,104
承诺？不记得
Promise? No.

650
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,278
想起来了
Yes.

651
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,312
你答应我你会查出西恩到底怎么了
You promised you'd find out
what happened to Sean.

652
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,153
我信守了承诺
And I kept my word.

653
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,419
你双胞胎哥哥的行为
Your twin brother's behavior

654
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,524
不是他自己的意愿
was not born of natural causes.

655
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,028
一个女巫下咒让他杀那些人
A witch hexed him
to commit those murders

656
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,822
然后自杀
and to kill himself.

657
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,556
我就知道
I knew it.

658
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,067
我就知道他没有疯
I knew he wasn't crazy.

659
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,903
那个女巫是谁？
Who is this witch?

660
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,371
你不用再烦脑这件事了
You needn't trouble yourself over her.

661
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:35,569
她已经为此血债血偿了
She has already paid for
her actions in blood.

662
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,280
什么？等等，你杀人了？
What? Wait.
You killed somebody?

663
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,715
我确实帮了点忙
Well, I had a hand in the matter, yeah.

664
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,953
原谅我对你的反应有点意外
Forgive me if I'm a little surprised
by your reaction.

665
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,252
那我应该怎么反应？
How the hell am l
supposed to react?

666
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,020
你把我牵扯进一场复仇谋杀中
You just made me culpable
in a revenge murder

667
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,254
而我从未要求过
I never asked for.

668
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,262
我活了数千年
I've been alive for a thousand years,

669
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,025
我向你保证，很多人死于
and, I can assure you,
many people have died

670
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,964
更微不足道的理由
for far less.

671
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:03,899
再说，你知道真相了，能好过一些了
Besides, now you can find comfort
in the truth.

672
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,301
真相？
你魅惑了我
The truth?
You compel me.

673
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,174
你让我平静地接受了一些
You make me at peace
with something

674
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,873
原本该让我撕心裂肺的事
that should be
tearing me up inside.

675
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,912
虽然不知道怎么做，但我会
I don't know how,
but I will undo

676
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,615
想尽一切办法解除它
whatever the hell it is
you've done to me,

677
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,191
到那个时候
and when I do,

678
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,330
你会后悔见过我
you're gonna wish
you never laid eyes on me.

679
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,415
嘿
Hey.

680
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,708
你去哪了？
Where you been?

681
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,612
你不是还在为我们那晚小争吵生气吧？
Not still mad about our tiff
the other night, are you?

682
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,618
过去的都过去了
Water under the bridge.

683
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,989
如果你还感兴趣的话，卡蜜归你了
Cami is all yours if you're interested.

684
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,294
我觉得我现在
I'm feeling like now
is not the right time

685
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,833
不太适合谈恋爱
for me to pursue a relationship.

686
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,164
时机就是一切，你懂吗？
Life is all about timing,
you know?

687
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,138
说到这个，我稍早去了你的住处
Speaking of,
I swung by your place earlier

688
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,970
想找你喝酒谈心
to commiserate over a drink,

689
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,807
但你刚好不在
but I must've just missed you.

690
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,950
皇宫饭店不太适合我
The Palace Royale didn't suit me.

691
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,114
我几周前就搬走了
I moved on weeks ago.

692
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,291
不，我是说你另一个住处
No.
I mean your other place.

693
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,564
海莉
Hayley.

694
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,899
有意思的落脚处
Interesting location
to put down your roots,

695
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,507
就在我当奴隶的地方
same plantation
where I was a slave.

696
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,239
我想这就是你从不邀请我过去的原因吧
I guess that's why
you never invited me over.

697
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,610
我太失礼了
我会跟以利亚说的
Well, how rude of me.
I'll speak to Elijah.

698
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,552
我相信他今晚一定很乐意
I'm sure he'll be pleased to host

699
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,585
招待你和黛维娜
you and Davina for the evening.

700
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,658
尤其是在你如此热情招待过他之后
Especially after you were
so hospitable to him.

701
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,827
很好
Good.

702
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,899
我很期待
I look forward to it.

703
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,775
再见就是再见，以利亚
Goodbye means goodbye, Elijah.

704
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,882
她和你在一起吗？
Is she with you?

705
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,753
你在说什么？
What the hell are you talking about?

706
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,880
海莉不见了，她在哪？
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

707
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,152
什么？
What?

708
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,651
马赛尔来过这里了
Marcel was here.

709
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,506
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
