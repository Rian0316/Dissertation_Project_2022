1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,570
Whatever you wanna do, I'm in your corner.

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:04,164
<i>Lynette made a promise...</i>

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:06,603
Mr. Faladi...
- I love him, and he loves me!

4
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,911
<i>and Bree's daughter fell
for her history teacher.</i>

5
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,652
Aah!
- <i>While Mike's history...</i>

6
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,274
He suffered
significant memory loss.

7
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:15,718
<i>was being carefully rewritten.</i>

8
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,985
- Susan Mayer.
- We were close, huh?

9
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,918
That tramp treated you
like dirt.

10
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:26,119
<i>(Mary Alice)
The art of sabotage--</i>

11
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:29,451
<i>it's practiced every day
in the suburbs.</i>

12
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:33,219
<i>Sometimes it takes the form
of a Bundt cake</i>

13
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:36,485
<i>offered to a friend
who's on a diet.</i>

14
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:38,052
<i>Other times,</i>

15
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,052
<i>it's a cable cut just
as a husband's friends arrive</i>

16
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,685
<i>to watch the big game.</i>

17
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:47,551
<i>And then there's always
that anonymous phone call</i>

18
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,024
<i>to the city zoning department.</i>

19
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:52,152
<i>Yes, in Suburbia,</i>

20
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,191
<i>everyone you meet
is a potential saboteur...</i>

21
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:58,599
<i>absolutely everyone.</i>

22
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,037
Good afternoon.

23
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,807
I'm, uh, Bree Hodge,
and you are?

24
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,686
Name's Gus,
and we're all booked up.
- Actually, Gus, um,

25
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,061
I'm here to see
one of your guests--

26
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:08,869
a gentleman named Faladi.

27
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,085
Oh, yeah,
came in about an hour ago.

28
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:13,916
You want me
to call him for you?
- No, no, no, no.

29
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,227
I'd like you to take me
to his room and unlock it

30
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,429
so I can
walk in unannounced.

31
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,963
(laughs) Lady, I can't do that.
Besides, he has a girl in there.

32
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,459
Yes, I know.
She's my daughter--

33
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,051
my 17-year-old daughter.

34
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:29,011
(chuckles) Yeah.

35
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:31,778
Uh, that would be, uh,
room, uh, 17.

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,378
Now there's irony for you.
(laughs)

37
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:37,601
You don't have
a gun in there, do you?

38
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:39,192
Because I just
put down new carpet.

39
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,280
Oh, Gus, I don't plan
anything unpleasant.

40
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,919
I'm simply going to inform
Mr. Faladi

41
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,424
what repercussions he faces

42
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,985
if he continues
this relationship

43
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,357
and trust him
to see reason.

44
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,326
- (Mr. Faladi) What the hell?!
- (Danielle) Mom!
What are you doing here?!

45
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,749
You just can't walk
right in here.
- How can you do this to me?!

46
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,621
What makes you think that
you can walk in here...

47
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,307
<i>Yes, the art of sabotage--</i>

48
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,756
<i>it's practiced every day
in the suburbs...</i>

49
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,017
(Mr. Faladi)
I told you, it's over!

50
00:02:10,736 --> 00:02:12,528
(Danielle crying)
But I love you!
- Okay, didn't you hear her?!

51
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:13,599
So how'd it go?

52
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:15,647
Quite well, I think.

53
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,591
<i>But few do it as well
as Bree Hodge...</i>

54
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,615
Oh, and, Gus,

55
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:24,932
the carpet is beautiful.

56
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,957
<i>or as politely.</i>

57
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:38,889

<font color="#ffff00">sync:frm@¶çæêñû¶ù</font>

59
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:12,750
<i>Family dinner--</i>

60
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>there was a time when
that phrase meant something</i>

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,128
<i>on Wisteria Lane.</i>

62
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,887
<i>Of course, this was back when
meals were lovingly prepared...</i>

63
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,085
<i>by wives who loved to cook...</i>

64
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,326
<i>for children
who remembered their manners.</i>

65
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,589
<i>But family dinners,
like the times, had changed,</i>

66
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,204
<i>and there was only one house
in the neighborhood</i>

67
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:44,083
<i>where dinner remained
a family occasion...</i>

68
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,107
<i>and attendance
was not optional.</i>

69
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:54,234
I don't know when I've tasted
such tender spring lamb.

70
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:55,242
THank you, dear.

71
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,632
Danielle, you haven't
touched your dinner.

72
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,457
She doesn't like spring lamb.

73
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:01,993
She prefers old goat.
(stifles laugh)

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,681
<i>I'm glad you guys think it's
so funny that my life is over.</i>

75
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,136
Your mother was right
to end that relationship.

76
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,352
<i>The man was your teacher
and married.</i>

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,064
He's getting a divorce.
Well, that hardly bolsters
his suitability.

78
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,432
Danielle, please, eat something.
- Don't worry, dear.

79
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,870
Hunger strikes
demand self-control,

80
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,958
and as we've seen,
that's hardly her strong suit.

81
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,126
When are you gonna take me seriously?
- When you start acting like an adult.

82
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,237
Well, she sleeps with them.
That's a start.

83
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,728
I hate you!

84
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:32,157
I hate all of you!

85
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,804
Remind me to buy paper plates.

86
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:42,611
We'll need them till a certain someone

87
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:43,819
can be trusted with china again.

88
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:49,866
Aah!

89
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,368
Wow, you're pretty good
at that.

90
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,808
Hey, you are home early.

91
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:00,880
Hi. Mwah.
Yes... I am.

92
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:02,722
What is all this?

93
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,727
We are having
a celebration.

94
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:07,232
Sit.

95
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,104
(chuckles)
What are we celebrating?

96
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,733
You being the greatest wife
in the world.

97
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:16,269
(laughs) THanks.

98
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:18,621
No, seriously, though.

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,755
I mean it.

100
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,963
How many wives would tell their
husbands to follow his dreams,

101
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,316
and then
have the patience to wait

102
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:29,130
while he figures out
what the hell it is?

103
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,114
Oh, my God!
You know what you wanna do!

104
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,995
That's fantastic!
What is it?

105
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,874
Wait for it,
wait for it...

106
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,728
Okay, I knew I needed
to spend my days

107
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,593
doing something I was passionate
about, something creative--

108
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,121
yeah, have at it--**

109
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,840
um, something where
I interacted with the public

110
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,057
but I was still
my own boss,

111
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:49,008
and then this morning,
it just like--bam, it hit me!

112
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:52,311
Okay, okay, I'm dying here.
What's the dream?

113
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,726
You're eating it.

114
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:57,902
Excuse me?

115
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,550
I'm gonna
open up a pizza parlor!

116
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,372
I bet you didn't
see that one coming.

117
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,285
No, that was a real frisbee
to the head, that one.

118
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:09,077
But--but when you think
about it,

119
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,332
doesn't it make
perfect sense?

120
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,914
I mean, marinara's in my blood.
You remember uncle Vito?

121
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,392
He came to this country
with nothing.

122
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,174
He turned that trattoria
into a gold mine.

123
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,006
Isn't he the one that...

124
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,502
asked us for a loan
last Christmas?

125
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,797
He has a gambling problem,
but don't blame the pizza.

126
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,028
Trust me. I've got
this thing all mapped out.

127
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,068
It's gonna have, like,
a real family feel,

128
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,210
with, like, big portions
but small prices,

129
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,374
crayons for the kids.

130
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,281
Oh, God,
I feel good about this.

131
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:37,732
Hmm.

132
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,329
So what do you think?

133
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:44,591
I think...

134
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,290
I'm gonna open
another bottle of wine.

135
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,680
But we haven't
finished this one.

136
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,271
Well, hey,
we're celebrating, right?

137
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,262
Carlos, what are you doing
in my room?

138
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,357
Oh, hey, Gaby,
you're home early.

139
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,567
God, Carlos!
Strawberries and champagne?

140
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,445
Did you really think
you're gonna seduce me?

141
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,404
Never entered my mind.
- Oh, right, right.

142
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,060
You know,
I may be living with you

143
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,385
until the divorce is final,
but it doesn't mean

144
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,948
I have to put up
with your cheesy come-ons.

145
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,762
Gaby,
can I just say one thing?

146
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,882
What, you've been
doing some thinking,

147
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,218
and you realize
that I'm your soul mate,

148
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,210
and there's a vacancy
in your heart only I can fill?

149
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,355
Gaby, listen--
it's over between us.

150
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:33,945
Just move on already.

151
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,265
Forget me.

152
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,358
As I was trying to say,
I have company over.

153
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,135
This is Trishelle.

154
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:53,294
Trishelle, this is...

155
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,149
what was your name again?

156
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,670
I seem to have forgotten.

157
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:07,689
So the doctor said

158
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,185
I should use as many things
as I can to jog your memory.

159
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,562
And not just pictures.

160
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,672
He said I could use tastes
and smells and sounds,

161
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,432
so tonight is...

162
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,006
"sounds of the seventies."

163
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay, uh...

164
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,173
Well, you know,
let me set the scene.

165
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,915
Um, we were at this
funky little fish joint

166
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,260
that you'd been dying
to take me to--Cappy's.

167
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:33,555
Do you remember Cappy's?

168
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,010
Okay, well,
we were there, and, uh,

169
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,658
we were just wolfing down
the most delicious trout ever--

170
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,634
How long
till the music part?

171
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:43,897
Oh, it's coming.

172
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,273
Um, and--and this
'70s cover band,

173
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,480
well, they started to play,

174
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:50,457
and... that's how
we got our song.

175
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:54,322
<i>(Rose Royce) * at the car wash,
whoa, whoa... *</i>

176
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,729
Our song was "Car Wash"?

177
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,142
Yeah!
See how much fun we were?

178
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,465
(laughs) So I dragged you out
onto the dance floor,

179
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,465
and, well, you were
giving me this look--

180
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,601
sort of like the look
you're giving me right now--

181
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,566
and, um,
I started to do this...

182
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,296
and then you did this...

183
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,438
I'm--look, I'm sorry,
this--this isn't working.

184
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,292
Oh, Mike. Come on, you're not
even trying to remember!

185
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,397
It was fun!

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,638
Oh, I know.
Okay, sing with me.

187
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:26,644
* car wash

188
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,108
* talkin' about
the car wash *

189
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,051
* whoo, car wash, yeah

190
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,067
You know, I'm really beat.

191
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,090
Okay, Mike, I-I am not
doing this to upset you.

192
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,329
I'm doing this to help.

193
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,810
I get that. it's just...

194
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,328
the music is giving me
a headache.

195
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:49,191
Okay, well...

196
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,856
I'll go, but I am not
giving up on you.

197
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,223
You know,
you are going to remember

198
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,047
the night that
We danced to "Car Wash,"

199
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,375
and not just because it was fun,
but because later that night,

200
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:00,975
we did some things
that, trust me,

201
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,706
are worth remembering.

202
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:13,932
That Jane Doe
from the golf course...

203
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,356
I think I missed something
at the autopsy.

204
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:21,218
Check it out.
- You always gotta come at lunch, don't you?

205
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,394
Those blue marks
on the back of her hand?

206
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:27,114
First I thought they were veins.
Now I think it's ink.

207
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,201
You mean,
like some kind of writing?

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,096
Yeah. I need to run
some more tests,

209
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,112
see if I can get
a clearer image.

210
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,193
I could be wrong, but...

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,656
But what?

212
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
I think
it's a phone number.

213
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,149
The oddest thing happened
at the club today.

214
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:49,357
Tish Atherton--

215
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,764
(sighs)
Andrew, would you be a dear

216
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,021
and make sure your sister's
just breaking her own things?

217
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,245
Anyway...
Hmm.

218
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,362
Tish Atherton...

219
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,319
Danielle?

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
Yeah, I'll tell 'em.

221
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,460
I'm telling you,
it was a deliberate snub.

222
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,818
I waved to her,
and she looked right through me.

223
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,698
True, I never bought
her eldest daughter a gift--
- Uh, Mom?

224
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:45,425
Andrew, please don't
interrupt me while I'm speaking.

225
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:47,953
True, I never bought
her eldest daughter a gift,

226
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:52,143
but you know my policy--
no husband, no baby gift.

227
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,032
Now what is it, dear?

228
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:58,143
Well, um, Danielle's upstairs
trying to commit suicide.

229
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,126
<i>There's no rush.
She's not trying that hard.</i>

230
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,781
How can you sit there
playing that ridiculous game?!

231
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,995
Your sister
tried to kill herself.

232
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,053
That doesn't upset you?

233
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,260
She tried to slit her wrists
with a spoon.

234
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:23,748
How upset
do you want me to be?

235
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,619
Mrs. Hodge?
- Is my daughter all right?

236
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,530
She's a little groggy,
but she'll be fine.

237
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,490
The wounds
are fairly superficial.

238
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,298
(scoffs)
So's the patient.

239
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:33,963
We'll release her tonight,

240
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,145
but you understand
that in cases like this,

241
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,680
counseling is mandatory.
- Of course. We'll get her
all the help she needs.

242
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,961
She is resisting our efforts
to pump her stomach.

243
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,800
She says she only took
three sedatives.

244
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,256
She's disoriented.
Pump her.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,328
Andrew!

246
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:50,975
Pump her.

247
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:58,109
They're sticking a tube
down her throat.

248
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,298
Do you still think
this is funny?

249
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,598
Mom, this was
a half-assed bid for attention.

250
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,012
This was a cry for help,
and if we don't listen,

251
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,188
the next time she could do
something even more dangerous.

252
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,116
Yeah, next time she might
jump off the porch.

253
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,347
Stop it!

254
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,659
Suicide is the worst thing
that can happen to a family!

255
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,771
I will not have it
made light of! (exhales deeply)

256
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,305
Orson's right.

257
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,425
We need to support
each other as a family.

258
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:28,225
In fact,

259
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,433
I say we all...
go for counseling.

260
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,278
(Gabrielle) Tom actually said
he's opening up a pizza parlor?

261
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:42,782
(Susan)
Lynette, you're not serious.

262
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:46,023
Mm-hmm.
- Well, might as well
stand in a vat of tomato sauce

263
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,550
and tear up $100 bills.
- I know, but I said that I would support him

264
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,622
and help him follow his dream.

265
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,704
Well, he can't hold you to that,
not if the dream is pizza.

266
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,461
She promised
to stand by him,

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,962
and once you make
that commitment

268
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,875
you have to see it through.
- yeah...
How's that divorce going?

269
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:05,059
I'm done talking.
- Hey, Parker, be careful up there.

270
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:06,986
I just keep thinking

271
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,338
he's gonna come to his senses
and realize it's a bad idea.

272
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,369
That's never gonna happen.
- Why?

273
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,208
Because men
are genetically incapable

274
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,713
of realizing
that their dreams are stupid.

275
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:18,816
Care to elaborate,
Dr. McCluskey?

276
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:21,695
My husband sold insurance
for 36 years,

277
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,301
and one day,
he woke up and decided

278
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,245
he wanted to move to paris
and paint naked ladies.

279
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:28,290
I told him, "Gilbert,
you can barely paint the garage.

280
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:30,546
What makes you think
you can commit art?"

281
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,362
And for the rest of his life,
he despised me.

282
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,041
He despised you
for saying "no"?

283
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,249
Well, he also thought
I was sleeping with his brother,

284
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,256
and I'm sure
that was mixed in there, too.

285
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,672
Okay, so I got Kayla
all unpacked.

286
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,367
Oh, great. So, uh, Tom will drop
her off at your house on friday.

287
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,646
Sounds good. Lynette,
can I talk to you for a second?

288
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,886
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

289
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,549
Okay, pardon me for having
really big ears,

290
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,931
but I heard about
Tom and this pizza place.

291
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,876
Do you wanna know what I think?
- No, not really.

292
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,676
It sucks.
It's a sucky idea,

293
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,468
and your friends
back there--

294
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,864
they're just too nice
to come right out and say it.

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,687
Luckily, I'm not your friend,
so you can trust me.

296
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:23,863
Nip it...

297
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,430
in... the bud.

298
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,293
And make Tom resent me
for the rest of his life.

299
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,064
I don't think so.

300
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,708
Well, you better do somethin',
'cause if you don't,

301
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,124
you <i>and</i> me

302
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,998
will wind up working a pole
to pay for braces.

303
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,281
Hey, Julie.
I bought you some flowers.

304
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,433
<i>Generally,
when you buy flowers,</i>

305
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,706
they don't still have
the roots on them.

306
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,201
Okay, uh, I was hoping
you could help me

307
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,201
with my English Lit paper.

308
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:01,104
Hi, I'm Sarah.
- Hey.

309
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,079
So what do you say?
- Actually, I'm sort of busy right now.

310
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,343
Oh, come on.

311
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,791
Look, aunt Edie's gonna
give me the boot if I flunk out.

312
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:11,799
Wouldn't you miss me?
- Oh, absolutely!

313
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,118
Whose motorcycle would wake us
all up at 2:00 in the morning?

314
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:15,958
You drive a motorcycle?
- Hmm.

315
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,581
(sighs) Please?

316
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,182
Look, I could really
use some help here.

317
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,401
Normally, I charge
12 bucks an hour for tutoring,

318
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,882
but seeing as it's you...

319
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:28,962
$15.

320
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,711
Great. See you friday.

321
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,126
Oh, and just so you know,

322
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,269
I charge $15 an hour
to make out,

323
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,123
so I'll probably break even.

324
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:45,186
Ugh.

325
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,977
Hi. You're new.
Where's Marcy?

326
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,567
She's in Honolulu on vacation.
Can I help you?

327
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,535
Oh, I'm just
going to see Mike Delfino.

328
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,368
What's that smell?
- Uh, that's my macaroni and cheese.

329
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,367
I-I was hoping it would
trigger Mike's memory.

330
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,332
I made it the first time we met two years ago.
- You should've refrigerated it.

331
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:14,549
Edie?

332
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,540
Oh, you know Ms. Britt?

333
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,939
Uh, yeah.
What is she doing here?

334
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,587
Visiting Mr. Delfino.

335
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,275
You know, she was with him
when he came out of his coma.

336
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,338
And she's been here
every day since.

337
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:31,260
You!

338
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,562
Hello, Susan.
Long time no see.

339
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,856
I've been wondering why
Mike's been so cold to me.

340
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,349
Now it all makes sense.
- I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

341
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:44,555
Whew! for God's sakes,
take a bath.

342
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,123
Oh, that's my mac and cheese.
Don't change the subject.

343
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,201
What have you been telling him about me?
- Why would I say anything about you?

344
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,665
Mike has no idea
who you are.

345
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:54,664
I envy him.

346
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,473
Ladies,
is there a problem?

347
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,999
I want this woman
banned from the hospital.

348
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,888
She's been like this
ever since Mike dumped her.

349
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,898
Imagine "Fatal Attraction"...
with a much older woman.

350
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,836
Ma'am, Mr. Delfino
already has a visitor.

351
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,054
I think you should go.

352
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,390
Me? But why
doesn't she leave?

353
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:14,262
I-I'm the one

354
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,045
who's been here every day
for the last six months.

355
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:19,301
Well, I don't know you,
but I do know his girlfriend.

356
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,716
Girlfriend?!
Okay, you know what?

357
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,091
I want Marcy's number
in Honolulu,

358
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,380
and I want it right now.

359
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,084
You need to leave.
- What?!

360
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:31,499
You're disturbing the other patients.
- No, what are you--
Oh, this is ridiculous!

361
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,874
I mean,
who am I disturbing?

362
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,283
It's a coma ward!
Don't you want them to wake up?!

363
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,276
I didn't call you that
- yes, you did!

364
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,665
I have never in my life
used the word "retard."
- It's what you think.

365
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,112
You think I'm that immature
moron who can't be trusted

366
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:48,535
to decide what's best for her.
- Well, you did try to off yourself.

367
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:49,943
I don't think
you get to pull

368
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,767
the "I know what's best for me" card.
- Andrew!

369
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,102
(lowered voice)
Not in front of the therapist.

370
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,591
Actually, I think
we're making great progress.

371
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,703
You feel
Danielle refuses to see

372
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,988
you're acting
in her best interest.

373
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,468
And you think your mother
cares more about her image

374
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,436
than your feelings.
- Danielle, how can you think

375
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:07,973
I don't care
about your feelings?

376
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,395
Don't you know how much
your mother loves you?

377
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,387
When I saw you in that tub,

378
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,929
it was the worst moment
of my life.

379
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,410
The thought of losing you
is more than I can bear.

380
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:18,865
How does that make you feel?

381
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:23,649
Actually...

382
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,472
kind of powerful.

383
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:30,360
Powerful?

384
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,118
You <i>really</i>
don't wanna lose me?
- of course not.

385
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,519
I already went through
thinking I'd lost Andrew.

386
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:37,607
I can't
go through that again.

387
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,141
Well, then, here's
what's going to happen--

388
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,374
I'm going
to start dating Robert again,

389
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,317
and if you try to break us up
or get him fired,

390
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:47,732
then I'm going to leave,

391
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,501
and you will <i>never</i>
see me again.
- Danielle.

392
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,708
If that can survive
on its own, so can I.

393
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,132
You don't believe me?

394
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,820
Call my bluff.
See what happens.

395
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,018
So...

396
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,739
what do we owe you
for all this <i>progress</i>?

397
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:13,753
Come on, Austin.
Concentrate.

398
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,441
Okay, why did
Iago betray Othello?

399
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:17,409
(sighs) Uh...

400
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,344
because the play would suck
if he didn't?

401
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,768
What do you think
you're doing?

402
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:25,511
Mmm.

403
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,696
Sorry.

404
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:29,454
No! No, no, no, no!
No, no, we're here to work.

405
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,278
And if my mom came home,
she'd flip.

406
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:32,301
Now put that away.

407
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,180
Ahh.

408
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:38,198
You said, "put it away."

409
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,496
Look, if--if you think

410
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,763
I'm gonna sit here
and write your paper for you

411
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,650
while you're getting drunk--
- No, just help me get it started, okay?

412
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:46,955
This is hard for me,
all right?

413
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,425
I didn't read a lot
of Shakespeare in juvie.

414
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,369
I kind of majored
in not getting stabbed.

415
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:54,112
Ugh, fine.

416
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:56,655
I'll write your intro, but--
but then you're on your own.

417
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:57,604
THank you very much.
(sighs)

418
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:04,127
So... why did they send you
to juvie anyway?

419
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,104
"They" didn't. My mom did.

420
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,022
Why?

421
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,221
She had this boyfriend--

422
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,364
no job, big drunk,
<i>real</i> catch.

423
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,692
One night,
he pops her one,

424
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,309
so I break a chair
over his head, and, uh...

425
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,301
and she calls the cops...
on <i>me</i>.

426
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,587
But you were
protecting her.

427
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,624
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

428
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,943
But the guy said he'd leave
if she didn't press charges,

429
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,031
and... well, my mom
doesn't really like to be alone.

430
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,653
You know what?
You're tired.

431
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:45,245
Um, why don't you lay down
for a couple minutes,

432
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,204
and I'll just
do a page or two?

433
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,506
You're a rock star, Mayer.

434
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:02,890
Carlos...

435
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:04,666
no Trishelle tonight?

436
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:06,252
Ah, no.

437
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,609
About her--
I have a confession to make.

438
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,577
Does her pimp want
the rest of the money?

439
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,584
You know, there is
some cash in my purse.

440
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,118
Look, I know I crossed a line
bringing her here, all right?

441
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:16,912
But I was trying
to make you jealous,

442
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,056
like the way
you made me feel

443
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,439
when you said you slept
with John Rowland again.

444
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,374
Well, I think
it's more than that.

445
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,205
<i>I think you really hate me.</i>

446
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,164
That's not true.
- Oh, I think it is.

447
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:29,621
You know,
introducing your spouse

448
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,310
to someone
you're about to have sex with?

449
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,421
There's only one reason
to do that--

450
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,551
pure hatred.

451
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,372
You don't know
what you're talking about.

452
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,214
Oh, I think I do.

453
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:54,402
Phil, come meet
my basically ex-husband--

454
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,555
tHank you--Carlos.

455
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,210
Carlos, this is
my new friend Phil Lopez.

456
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,423
We've met, Gaby.

457
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,772
Really?
Well, that's weird. When?

458
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,620
Fairview Chamber of Commerce--
the annual dinner.

459
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,947
Oh, my God! That's right!
That's right! (laughs)

460
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,051
You were up

461
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,075
for the latino businessman
of the year award

462
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:12,995
that Phil won.

463
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,794
Well, actually,
I beat him out twice.

464
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:16,489
No!

465
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:20,060
Ooh, I remember.
Carlos was so annoyed.

466
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:21,449
What did you say, hon?

467
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,098
"He may have that trophy,
but I've got you."

468
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,160
Ain't life funny? (laughs)

469
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:30,871
Gaby,
can we talk for a sec?

470
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,583
Mnh-mnh, not right now.

471
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:33,871
Phil and I are
getting in the hot tub.

472
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,852
Ooh, Phil, did you bring your suit?
- You said I didn't have to.

473
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:40,411
<i>Not in front of Arlos-cay!</i>

474
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,310
Go outside.
I'll meet you there.

475
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:47,563
Phil Lopez?

476
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,837
You brought home
Phil Lopez?!

477
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,531
I had no idea
you hated me that much!

478
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,162
Well, now you know.

479
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,026
Aah!

480
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:03,889
Hey, good news.

481
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,473
My realtor found me
some sweet locations.

482
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:08,482
That's... great.
(chuckles)

483
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,992
Hey, can we talk about this
restaurant thing for a second?

484
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,151
Yeah. What's up?

485
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:16,224
I don't know if you noticed,

486
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:18,968
but when you first pitched
the whole pizza concept...

487
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,014
(chuckles)
I was a wee bit skeptical.

488
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,302
Yeah, I sensed that.

489
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,376
Of course you did,
'Cause you're a smart guy,

490
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:28,182
which is also why you are gonna
jump on the idea I have

491
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:30,726
to make
the whole thing work.

492
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:32,797
Okay, so you're not
bailing on me?

493
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:36,622
No. No, no, no,
I am totally on board.

494
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,508
(laughs) Oh, good! You had me
scared there for a second.

495
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,492
Okay, so, well,
what is this great idea?

496
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,860
I'm thinking...

497
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,114
catering company.

498
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:48,027
Huh?

499
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:50,947
Start small,
have an Italian theme,

500
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,363
create some cash flow,
and then later on,

501
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:56,849
expand into the pizza thing.

502
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,136
But that's not my dream.

503
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,650
Well, think about it.

504
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,648
You're gonna do
all these fun parties.

505
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:06,575
People will start talking--
"Hey, this is great food.

506
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:08,409
This guy should
open a restaurant."

507
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,463
"Yeah, yeah, I'd eat there,"
and then wham!

508
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:12,727
Five short years later,

509
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,205
you have
a built-in customer base.

510
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,918
But I said it's not my dream.
Pizza is my dream.

511
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:20,641
I know, I know. Catering's how you get there.
- So why can't I just skip the catering

512
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,809
and go straight to the pizza?
- Because you'll fail!

513
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:28,368
I'm sorry! God. (groans)
I shouldn't have said that.

514
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:30,968
But you're gambling
with our life savings,

515
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,239
and you have no experience.

516
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,112
You said that you'd support me.

517
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,515
I'm trying to.
I am trying to.

518
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,337
But are you aware

519
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,471
that 90% of restaurants
tank in their first year?

520
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,360
Which means that
10% of them make it!

521
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,039
Why don't you ever think
that I would be one of them?

522
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,943
No! No, do me a favor.

523
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:55,550
Don't answer that.

524
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:06,807
Yoo-hoo! Carlos!

525
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,430
I'm making a snack
for Phil.

526
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:12,885
Do you want
something to eat?

527
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:16,173
Some sour grapes, perhaps?

528
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,389
Maybe a little crow?

529
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:28,227
Okay, we need
to move this over there.

530
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,043
Why?

531
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:31,610
Uh, Feng Shui.

532
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,610
(banging)
(Gabrielle) Yes! Yes!

533
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,233
(laughs)
Hey, don't start without me.

534
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,186
(lowered voice) Oh, no, no,
let's get something straight--

535
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,065
you and I are not gonna
have sex tonight.

536
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:53,881
What?

537
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,382
I'm sorry.
No offense, you're a nice guy.

538
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,896
I'm just
not into you that way.

539
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,125
Oh, God, Phil!

540
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:02,598
Yes, yes, give it to me!

541
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:03,805
Okay. Oh, okay.

542
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,228
No, no, I'm not
talking to you. Back off!

543
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:07,588
What--but I thought--
I mean...

544
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:11,036
You know, the hot tub...
We were...
- Yes, you saw my boobs,

545
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,109
and you're gonna
have that mental snapshot

546
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,270
to use as you wish
for the rest of your life...

547
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,181
but that is
<i>all</i> you're getting!

548
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,556
Wait, wait,
so you're just using me?

549
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:23,093
You're unbelievable.

550
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:23,932
I'm what?!

551
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:25,555
(Phil)
You are unbelievable!

552
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:28,770
Really?
Oh, so are you, big boy!

553
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:30,616
Yes!

554
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,280
No wonder you're divorcing her.
She's a straight-up loon.

555
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:41,784
Oh, crap.
She's blocking my car!

556
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,975
Always happy
to help a brother out.

557
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:47,831
Hold on.

558
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,574
(Gabrielle) Oh, God, yes!

559
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:55,310
Oh, ride 'em, cowboy!

560
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,893
Oh, yes, God!

561
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,780
Take me home, Philly!

562
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,789
You should wear a saddle!

563
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,101
Yes! Yes!

564
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,028
Stop it, Phil.
- I told you to beat it.

565
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:07,893
No means no!

566
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:11,964
I need your car keys.

567
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,275
You're blocking
the stallion's hatchback.

568
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:25,537
"Oh, yes, yes, Phil!

569
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,262
Fill me with Phil!"

570
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:31,044
I never said that.
- (chuckles) And you moved the bed.

571
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,226
What were you thinking?

572
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,579
Shut up.
- You know, if you were trying to hurt me,

573
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:37,178
that's not the way to do it.
- Well, then enlighten me.

574
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,371
How can I hit you so hard
that you will never recover?

575
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,265
You can't.

576
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:47,073
Oh, I have to, Carlos.
I need you to give up on us.

577
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,041
We're not good for each other,
and I can't keep doing this.

578
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:52,639
But I can.

579
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,069
You proved something
tonight--

580
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:58,029
you had a rich,
good-looking guy in your bed,

581
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:59,162
and you couldn't
pull the trigger.

582
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:03,426
That means you still care,
and as long as I know that,

583
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,185
I can take anything
that you can dish out.

584
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,250
You know what? I'm tired.

585
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,265
Can we talk about this
in the morning?

586
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:15,897
Sure.

587
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,136
But you're bringing me
breakfast in bed or no deal.

588
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,070
It's a date.

589
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:40,453
Sarah?

590
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,052
What are you--oh!

591
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,379
Oh, Julie!
THank God it's you.

592
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:46,579
We totally thought
you were the cops.

593
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,602
(grunts) Oh, hey, Julie.

594
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,307
What are you,
on buzz kill patrol tonight?

595
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:53,475
<i>This</i> is why you couldn't
go to the movies with me?

596
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,241
Well, sorry, I thought
you weren't that into him.

597
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,977
But, you know, if you are--
I'm not!

598
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,114
I'm just--
I'm mad that you blew me off.

599
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,986
Well,
I would totally understand

600
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,720
if you wanted
to blow me off for a date.

601
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,376
(scoffs) You call this a date--
getting mauled in a car?

602
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:09,160
Hey, you wanna
talk about this later?

603
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,864
I'm losing altitude here.

604
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,974
<i>Ugh, you are disgusting!</i>

605
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,814
<i>Enjoy the rest of your date.</i>

606
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:21,334
Julie, there you are.

607
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,606
I think I found a way
to get through to Mike.

608
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,750
Let it go!
He's not into you!

609
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,476
Gaby, rise and shine.

610
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,380
I made you some waffles.

611
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,518
I got a second wind last night,
so I went to a bar.

612
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,932
That's where I met Jason.

613
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,081
We spent the whole night--
how did you put it?

614
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:49,841
Pulling the trigger.

615
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,392
So did I hurt you,
or should I keep trying?

616
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:09,924
You kicked ass
in rehab today.

617
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,253
Yeah, I raised my arm
over my head.

618
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,013
Sign me up
for the olympics.

619
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,356
Oh, be patient.
It takes time.

620
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:18,312
Ms. Britt?
hmm?

621
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:19,940
Phone call for you
at the nurses' station.

622
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,343
For me? Huh.

623
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:23,917
I'll be right back.

624
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:31,483
There's a phone call
for me?

625
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:34,907
Susan? What are you--

626
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:37,067
Shh! I thought you could use
some fresh air.

627
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,074
Hello?

628
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,018
Hello? It's Edie.

629
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:45,112
What the hell is this?
Who's he?

630
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,665
Oh, this is Hank,
and he has very kindly offered

631
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,138
to take us on
a little field trip today...

632
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,737
for 60 bucks an hour.

633
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:52,511
Where are you taking me?

634
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,092
Uh, just a little jaunt
down Memory Lane.

635
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:57,724
Oh, God, you're not
taking me to that

636
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,763
fish and disco place,
are you?
(laughs) No, no.

637
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:02,573
What we're doing today
is a little more low-key.

638
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,091
Don't worry.
You're totally safe.

639
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:05,978
We're not
doing anything wrong.

640
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,640
Punch it!

641
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,086
Hello.
- Look, Mrs. Hodge,

642
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,678
uh, I've only seen your daughter
once since the motel.

643
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:23,156
She told me
that you backed off.

644
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:25,077
Oh, Mr. Faladi,
I'm not here to threaten you.

645
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:28,844
I've come to give you
my blessing.
- Your blessing?

646
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,443
Yes, Danielle
made it quite clear

647
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,715
that I'm powerless
to stop this relationship,

648
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:35,139
and since she assures me
that you love her--

649
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,187
You do love her,
don't you?

650
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,043
Uh, yes, of course.

651
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,180
Good. Then we're all set.

652
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:45,187
Here are some of her clothes.

653
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,082
I'll bring her CDs and her
stuffed animals over tomorrow.

654
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,442
You want her to stay here?
This place is kind of small.

655
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,858
Well, that hotel room
was small,

656
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,697
and you seemed
happy enough there.

657
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,577
Oh, and I trust you
to be discreet.

658
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,880
You wouldn't want your wife
find out about this

659
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:02,400
and use it against you
in your divorce.

660
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:05,473
Whoa, whoa, Mrs. Hodge?

661
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:08,519
Things are getting
a little bit complicated.

662
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:10,968
Could you
please tell Danielle

663
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:13,015
that this is not gonna
work out and that we--

664
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,351
Mr. Faladi, if you want to
break my daughter's heart,

665
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:17,863
I can't stop you,
but I will not be an accomplice.

666
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:19,453
You'll tell her yourself.

667
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,510
Right.
- And don't even think about blaming me,

668
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,285
'cause if you so much
as mention that we spoke,

669
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:27,116
I'll phone the police.

670
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,452
Fine, I will
leave you out of it.

671
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:36,584
Oh, and one more thing...
- Yes?

672
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,334
Danielle is applying
to colleges.

673
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,069
I do hope she can count on you
for a glowing recommendation.

674
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:45,229
Sure.

675
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,756
And when I locked myself
out of the house,

676
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,739
that's where the bush was
that you found me in... naked.

677
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,115
Surely you remember that.

678
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:57,578
Nope.

679
00:33:58,874 --> 00:33:59,675
Ouch, that hurts.

680
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,082
Um, okay,
remember this spot?

681
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:04,944
This is where
we sat in your truck

682
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:06,058
and had our first kiss.

683
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,476
Were you naked then, too?

684
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,381
(sighs) Mike,
why are you being this way?

685
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:15,374
Because this is pointless.

686
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,165
I... I'm sorry.

687
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,932
I can't--I don't remember
being with you.

688
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:23,181
Okay, I know it's hard,
but you gotta make an effort,

689
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:24,860
and, you know,
if your head is a little foggy,

690
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:25,723
then don't look there.

691
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,635
Look in your heart,
because I'm in there,

692
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:31,699
just like
you're inside mine.

693
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,306
Okay, um,
this is Mary Alice's house,

694
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,561
and this is
where we first met.

695
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:43,145
I was setting out
my macaroni and cheese,

696
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,096
and you were invited--
- Oh! ow! (grunts)

697
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:47,417
I'm good.

698
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,320
Finally, a smile.

699
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:51,864
You do that a lot,
don't you?

700
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,111
Well, yeah, I've been known
to take a spill or two,

701
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:56,132
but, you know, my doctor says
it's an inner ear...

702
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,400
Wait, you remember that?

703
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,563
Yeah, I think I... do.

704
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:04,491
Yes! That's progress! See?

705
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,742
Oh, it's all gonna come back.
We're gonna be us again!

706
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,654
But... what about
the British guy?

707
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:16,900
Mike...

708
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,378
I don't know
what Edie's been telling you,

709
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,318
but Ian and I--
we're just friends.

710
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:23,429
Just friends?

711
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:25,020
Yeah...

712
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:26,908
now.

713
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:33,139
Look,
you gotta understand.

714
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,731
The doctors were telling me

715
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,659
that you would probably
never wake up,

716
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:40,777
and I just needed
somebody to talk to.

717
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:45,445
And that's what you were
doing in the country--talking?

718
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:51,284
(nurse) Mr. Delfino?

719
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:52,332
Are you okay?

720
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:56,242
I'm fine.

721
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:58,937
You can't just discharge
a patient without permission!

722
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,146
Oh, but you--I was just
trying to help him remember.

723
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,521
Tell her, Mike. We were--
we were making progress.

724
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,001
Take me back
to the hospital.

725
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,642
Oh, uh...

726
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:15,367
Mike!

727
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,054
Well, at the risk
of stating the obvious,

728
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,169
it's over. He's mine now.

729
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:24,165
No, no, no, no! No, no,
this--this is not how this ends.

730
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,750
No, evil does not triumph
over good.

731
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,007
<i>That's</i> how you see me?

732
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,855
Damn straight!
You lie, you cheat, you scheme!

733
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,979
You ruin
people's relationships!

734
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:34,932
I mean,
how do you sleep at night?

735
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:37,628
Soon with Mike
on top of me,

736
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,890
if you know what I mean.

737
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:41,595
See? Evil!

738
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:42,779
Evil!

739
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,485
has it ever occurred to you

740
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,873
that maybe Mike and I are
meant to end up together?

741
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:50,365
No!

742
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,444
You--you--Mike?
You don't even want him!

743
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:55,145
You're just doing this
to hurt me.

744
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,729
Wow. How self-absorbed
can you be?

745
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,816
I have had a thing for Mike
since the day he moved in here,

746
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,063
and I even backed off

747
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,863
when he fell for your
little Miss Adorable act.

748
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:07,925
But he's over that.
It's my turn now,

749
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,590
and I will be better for him
than you ever were.

750
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:12,612
and if you do get hurt,

751
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,893
Well... (chuckles)
that's just gravy.

752
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:22,077
All right, maybe <i>that</i>
was a little evil.

753
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,032
Finally.

754
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,026
Sorry it took so long.

755
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,090
That last digit
was barely legible.

756
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,340
I thought you'd like
to do the honors.

757
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,942
<i>(Mike) You've reached
Mike Delfino plumbing.</i>

758
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:00,660
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

759
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:02,457
<i>(beep)</i>

760
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,061
Whoa, a D-minus. That blows.
- Yeah, it does,

761
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,358
especially since it's
not the one we did together.

762
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:21,209
You e-mailed me
the wrong paper.

763
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,736
You didn't even read it
before you turned it in?

764
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:24,935
I didn't think I had to!

765
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,399
The one you wrote
that night was great.
- Well, after you left,

766
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,038
I decided I really should
put it in your words.

767
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,750
Is this some weird chick thing
you did 'cause you're into me?

768
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:36,316
Oh, please.

769
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:38,948
No, no. No, it is.

770
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,628
You're, uh, pissed 'cause
I hooked up with your friend.

771
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:42,901
No, I'm pissed because
you told me some sob story

772
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:43,940
so I'd write your paper
for you.

773
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:46,100
Now you owe me 15 bucks.

774
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:50,371
You know what? Here.

775
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,266
Oh, and, uh,
I <i>did</i> learn something.

776
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,169
Iago betrayed Othello
because he was jealous.

777
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:08,608
Oh, Danielle, I thought you'd
be with Mr. Faladi tonight.

778
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,007
Oh, you'll be happy to know
he dumped me.

779
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,775
he dumped you?
- Said it was
getting too messy,

780
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,358
that I was gonna
complicate his divorce.

781
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,771
Don't pretend you're sorry.

782
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,263
I don't plan to.

783
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:23,262
Well, I hope this doesn't make
history class too awkward.

784
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,093
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

785
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,957
I went to the principal
and got his ass fired,

786
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,541
and then when he called to yell
at me for squealing on him,

787
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,796
I recorded the call and sent
a tape of it to his wife.

788
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,964
Thanks to me, he'll be getting
nothing in this divorce.

789
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,220
Well, I must say
that was rather underhanded.

790
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:45,396
Yes. I wonder
where she gets it.

791
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:50,570
(Kayla) Bye, Daddy.

792
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,705
Bye, my chipmunk. I'll see
you guys next Friday, okay?

793
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,843
Kayla said that
you're opening a pizza place.

794
00:39:57,138 --> 00:39:59,978
Well, maybe. I mean,
it's not a done deal yet.

795
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,026
Ah...

796
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,041
Lynette put
the kibosh on it, huh?

797
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:06,690
What makes you say that?
(chuckles)

798
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:07,792
Well, you know...

799
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:09,535
Lynette.

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,481
Well, she's probably right.

801
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,616
I mean, there's a bunch
of dumb schmucks out there

802
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:17,414
trying to open a restaurant, so...
- You know, Tom, I've tasted your pizza,

803
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:20,271
and I have to be
perfectly honest with you.

804
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,326
It was like I died
and went to italy.

805
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:27,284
Really?

806
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:30,148
Oh, my God.
You are born to do this,

807
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,253
and I just hate to see you
give it up, because, well...

808
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,052
man,
this is none of my business,

809
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,004
but Lynette does...

810
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,891
bully you sometimes.

811
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,290
Well, she doesn't mean to.

812
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,267
Then don't let her!
You go to the mat on this one.

813
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,903
She will respect you
a lot more if you grow a pair.

814
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,791
I'm not
trying to insult you.

815
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,838
all I'm saying is that...

816
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,586
I know
what you're capable of,

817
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,244
and I believe in you.

818
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:10,602
I really needed to hear that.
(chuckles)

819
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:15,145
Thanks.

820
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:23,859
<i>Sabotage--</i>

821
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,304
