    and she told me the city    
     has recently shored up     

371
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,073
       all of the drainage      
        along the arroyo.       

372
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:16,801
 And they have repaved 10 miles 
    of roads in the vicinity.   

373
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,138
     So that would not only     
   speed up our construction,   

374
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,824
   but make for a more efficient
             operation overall. 

375
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,143
         And over the long term,
               it seems to me   

376
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,088
         that these improvements
             will pay dividends 

377
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,573
            and more than offset
                 any delays.    

378
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,650
             Since we won't need
                 a redesign,    

379
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,154
    we could be back on track in
 a matter of two to three weeks,

380
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,413
                 maybe less.    

381
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:40,325
   Are you saying               
that we lose three weeks        

382

of the land that we already own?

384
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,516
              but according to  
            our own projections,

385
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:51,761
         the land we already own
  will more than double in value

386

         in the next five years.

387
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:56,190

with a hard day's work.         

495
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,209
         So,                    
you say a man came in           

496

 across the counter

And since the camera system     
wasn't working at the time,     

504
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:54,581
 you're the only one            
who saw the perpetrator.

508
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,074
So, this person came in,        
and they bought something.      

509
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,408
                   I think      
           it was an Almond Joy.

the cash from the register.
