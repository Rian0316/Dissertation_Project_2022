Thirty-seven minutes,

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,793
we got from the apartment
to the subway

to the pastry school

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,835
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,389
and my thong
may be on backwards.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,073
There's no wrong way
to wear a thong,

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,151
as long as it's uncomfortable.

the bra's just for decoration.

in a car seat.

I was gonna kiss you?

my clothes one day,

but I don't say
anything about it.

- Morning, guys.
- Oh, hi, Bebe.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,597
Surprised to see me, right?

gonna make it through the night,

even surprised myself.

with someone who's about
to snap like a breadstick?

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,158
Not as much fun
as you'd think.

25

But Bebe's sweet,

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,512
and working here is putting you
through pastry school.

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,193

- Bye.

a Gordon Ramsay moment.

33

Why?

35

you're doing it wrong.

I loved her so much.

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,635
So sorry.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,189
That's kind of how I felt
about my old neighbor, Carla.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,430
I mean, she didn't take care of me,
but when I was a kid,

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,591
she used to let me drink
out of her hose.

she was driving me

been here since my nanny died.

at Chipotle.

ten minutes later,

65

also at Chipotle.

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,154
Show some sensitivity.

I was crying
because my nanny died,

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,269
and also because our grief
brunch was at Chipotle.

- Well, I didn't know her.

146

In fact, I only know her
as the lady who brought me

147
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,757
and cheese steaks together.

148
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,070
Even though we've never met,
it'll mean so much

149
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,800
to Antonia's family that I came
out of respect.

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,678
It'll mean so much
to my therapist that I left

151
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,070
my safe zone and only brought
one of the dogs.

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,118
Max, do you think,
in addition to my eulogy,

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,396
I should read something
from my childhood journal?

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,511

you're gonna do it anyway.

chick costume she made me.

Peep-peep.

168
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,919
- Aw, so cute.
- Car.

169
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,357
I never had
a Halloween costume.

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,192
I used to put my hair
in a messy bun

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,318
and stumble from door-to-door
telling people I was my mother.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,040
This Halloween,
I went as my doctor, Michael.

173
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,431
And I dressed up my buddy here
as his lover, Joseph.

174
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,119
We lost.

175
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,433
Antonia was always
there for me.

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,034
Halloween, Christmas, Easter,
every holiday.

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,315
Really, every day.

178
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,158
She was really like
a mother to me.

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,799
Where was your real mother?

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,190
Hey, what kind of dog is that?
I mean, besides sad?

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,191
Her mother had an affair,
got pushed out.

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,157
That's her hot spot,
so don't lick it.

183
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,670
It's okay, Max,
I don't need any protection.

184
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,955
You don't need protection?

185
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,997
Who are you, every guy
I've ever dated?

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,549
Bebe, yes, my mother
was unfaithful to my father,

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,675
so she was sent away.

188
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,876
But I had Antonia,
and she took care of me.

189
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,359
She was my family.

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,909
That must have been hard.
Everybody needs a mother.

191
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,672
I'd be crazy
without my mother.

192
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,915
She drives me
to all my appointments.

193
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,479
But you drive.

194
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,675
Yeah...

195
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,876
But I'm not supposed to.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,275
It's okay I asked Bebe
to wait in the car, right?

197
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,874
I mean, she'll be okay.
We cracked a window.

198
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,554
Yeah, and she's got a bowl
and a chew-toy.

199
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,278
Come on, let's sign in.

200
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,191
Max, I have to keep it together
when I meet the family.

201
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,271
I can't be all emotional.

202
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,795
Look, my hand's shaking.
This is terrible.

203
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,353
(COUGHS)

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,158
What?
It was a terrible signature.

205
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,753
And there were only five
other names on the page.

206
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,791
Get rid of it.

207
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,075
"Get rid of it"?

208
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,390
Who are you, every guy
I've ever dated?

209
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,996
Caroline Channing.

210
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,559
Here, Max.

211
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,948
Oh, look.

212
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,634
The flowers and everything
are so beautiful.

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,829
There you go.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,390
You signed
"Phil E. Cheesesteak"?

215
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,958
You told me not
to mention it anymore,

216
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,037
so it's just a reminder.

217
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,435
Okay, Max, there are
gonna be a lot of people

218
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,596
who will want my attention,
so please be patient

219
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,591
and stand next to me for
the occasional supportive lean.

220
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,313
And if someone starts
to get too weepy,

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,357
push them out of the way because
I can't get tears on this dress.

222
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,670
It has to be back
at Barneys by 9:00 AM.

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,357
- You're here.
- Here we go, Max.

224
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,517
(SOBBING)

225
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,830
I was talking to him.

226
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,388
Of course you were.
It's a very sad day for us all.

227
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,110
That was rough!

228
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,630
Oh.

229
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,075
Max, look.
This is Antonia.

230
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,919
- Wow. She looks really nice.
- She was.

231
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,310
I didn't know she was
in the military.

232
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,358
But it does explain those
fabulous bed sheet corners.

233
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,795
Wait, you didn't know
your nanny was a marine?

234
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,518
That's too bad,
'cause I'd be all,

235
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,877
"Yo, other little rich kid,
my nanny can snap your neck!"

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,230
Oh, look, there are her sisters,
Cecelia and Angela,

237
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,709
and there are her nieces
and nephews.

238
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,838
And there is... not me anywhere.

239
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,473
You know, my picture
must be in the coffin

240
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,232
with the other VIPs.

241
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,358
If you're a VIP, can we get
some bottle service?

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,397
Good afternoon, ladies.
I'm Anthony.

243
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,999
Antonia's nephew.

244
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,195
It's sad day, huh?

245
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,634
Yes, it is.

246
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,757
Oh. Think I just got
a little less sad.

247
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,155
Oh! Anthony!

248
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,753
Stop.
We're family.

249
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,989
I'm Caroline Channing.

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,754
You're Caroline "Hot,"
is all I know.

251
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,310
You ladies need cash envelopes
or you guys cool?

252
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,633
I always need
a cash envelope.

253
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,912
I'm sorry,
envelopes for what?

254
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,150
Well, at Italian wakes,
the mourners give the family

255
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,231
a donation after they view
the deceased.

256
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,992
So, it's pay-per-view?

257
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,952
That was a good one.

258
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,552
Hey, you want to go
get a pop later?

259
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,388
We're leaving right after,
but, yes, Anthony, thank you.

260
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,913
We'll take an envelope.

261
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,593
The body's right through there.

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,996
Go right ahead.

263
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,515
Anthony, stop.

264
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,755
I'm really nervous.

265
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,353
I've never seen
a dead body before.

266
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,669
I've seen a bunch.

267
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,876
A couple of them
were my fault.

268
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,392
I don't have any cash.
Do you have any money?

269
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,152
Let me check my wallet.

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,553
This is a real Ziploc,
not one of those knock-offs.

271
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,994
Make sure you seal
the envelope,

272
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,196
so people think
it's all quarters.

273
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,229
Max, we're next.
I'm afraid. Hold my hand.

274
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,594
Hold hands?

275
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,194
What are we, on a Christian Mingle
fifth date?

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,399
Please, Max.
I'm nervous.

277
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,516
- Oh, God.
- Thank you.

278
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,159
Okay, now give it back.

279
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,478
What? That was just
my longest relationship.

280
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,029
Plus, I need it to put
this change in the envelope.

281
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,718
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

282
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,639
Hi, Antonia.
It's me, Caroline.

283
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,949
Should I kiss her?

284
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,314
The family is right
there watching.

285
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,431
- The lady before us kissed her.
- Go for it.

286
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,318
Doesn't look like
she'd bite you.

287
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,279
Okay, on the count of three.

288
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,192
One, two...

289
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,793
No, Max, hold my hand again
while I...

290
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,072
What do we do?

291
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,635
Wait, leave it!

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,755
We were giving it
to them anyway.

293
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,309
Not all of it.
That's our cheese steak money.

294
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,596
Leave it. Come on.

295
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,395
I am so, so sorry
about that.

296
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,750
My nerves got the best of me.
You understand.

297
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,037
- I'm Cecelia, Antonia's...
- Sister, I know.

298
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,713
I see the resemblance.

299
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,279
I'm Caroline.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,116
Caroline who?

301
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,794
Oh. Caroline Channing.

302
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,189
Caroline Channing who?

303
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,353
You're having
a hard time processing.

304
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,430
Understandable.

305
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,113
It's been a very emotional day
for us all.

306
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,077
Who is this girl?

307
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,629
You, I feel like
I've seen somewhere.

308
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,354
Are you Ricky's girl
from Rochester?

309
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,829
I could be.
What's in it for me?

310
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,470
Antonia used to take care of me
when I was little.

311
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,950
Oh, Antonia
was your babysitter.

312
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,673
Very nice of you to come.

313
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,434
Well, she was hardly
my babysitter.

314
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,989
She took care of me
every day for ten years.

315
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,196
Caroline.
Caroline Channing.

316
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,319
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are, sweetheart,

317
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,598
though it seems to be
what you're hammering me about.

318
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,679
If you'll excuse me,
I need a cigarette.

319
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,989
And then I got to remove

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,033
some of those pennies off
of my sister.

321
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,993
It's a coffin,
not a wishing well.

322
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,956
This funeral turned out
to be very depressing.

323
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,189
Well, yeah.

324
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,477
Dead body in the room,
generally a buzz-kill.

325
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,868
Unless it's an Irish wake,

326
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,429
then you're playing beer pong
off the coffin.

327
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,990
No, I mean, how is it possible
that the family doesn't know me?

328
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,037
Did Antonia never even
mention me?

329
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,112
Let's focus on the positive.
Anthony really liked your ass.

330
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,955
I know what Antonia
and I had.

331
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,394
This is what we had.

332
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,955
Peep-peep.
That's what we had.

333
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,712
Well, that's a lot.

334
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,757
But I guess no one in this
family wants to admit that,

335
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,434
and it's a shame too,
because I had a great eulogy.

336
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,114
- You do?
- Yes. I do.

337
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,599
Would you like me
to share it with you?

338
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,990
- I most certainly would.
- Oh!

339
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,799
You are not seriously
eulogy-bombing

340
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,353
that old lady, are you?

341
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,317
She asked me
about my great eulogy.

342
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,396
She's 100,

343
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,552
she probably thought you said
you had a great urologist.

344
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,548
Do you have a pen?

345
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,479
I'm getting the name
of her doctor.

346
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,910
No, ma'am, I didn't say,
"urologist."

347
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,753
I said, "eulogy."
A great eulogy.

348
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,798
Why would you give
the eulogy?

349
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,955
Because I'm Caroline Channing.

350
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,269
Who?

351
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,351
Caroline Channing.

352
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,190
Caroline Channing?

353
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,237
Antonia was my nanny.

354
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,119
My family was rich, but then
my father robbed everyone,

355
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,872
and we became
the scourge of society,

356
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,399
overshadowed a little bit

357
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,391
by Mel Gibson hating the Jews
that same week.

358
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,919
Surely, you remember?

359
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,479
Honey, I don't even remember
how I got here.

360
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,233
I can't believe this.

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,715
I constructed my entire
"happy" childhood

362
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,359
on the fact that
even though my mom left

363
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,273
and apparently didn't love me,
Antonia did.

364
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,994
And now I get here
and I realize no one loved me,

365
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,269
I was just a paycheck.

366
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,198
One of the many kids
she babysat.

367
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,516
I don't even know
why I bothered to come.

368
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,353
I'm gonna go to the restroom
and then we can just leave.

369
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,599
Excuse me. Hi.

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,233
Max, Ricky's girl.

371
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,073
Ahem. I know this is
a hard time for you,

372
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,719
but it's a hard time
for my friend as well.

373
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,518
And even though
you never heard of her,

374
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,875
I was wondering if you could
just go over there,

375
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,029
and say you just
remembered her,

376
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,992
and that Antonia talked
about her all the time?

377
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,709
I know it's a 180 on your
original story and a lie,

378
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,592
and I'd offer to pay you
for your trouble,

379
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,115
but my 401K is laying in that
box on top of your sister.

380
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,633
Look, I only permitted
you two to stay

381
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,712
'cause your Ricky
was so nice to Uncle Joe

382
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,269
when he fell off the roof
last year.

383
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,951
But now, you gotta go.

384
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,195
Okay.

385
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,918
Be that way.

386
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,638
But don't expect Ricky
to pick up Uncle Joe

387
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,273
for dialysis.

388
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,872
Max, what are you doing?

389
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,758
The family asked me
to put it up.

390
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,909
They just remembered you.

391
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,479
Oh, my God.

392
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,398
I'm so pathetic, you have
to put up my picture

393
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,629
to make me feel better?

394
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,791
In a way, yes.

395
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,034
It belongs up there.

396
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,395
Who wouldn't want
to know that kid?

397
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,870
Nice to meet you, Antonia.
Please don't haunt us.

398
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,235
Now, let's hit the road and get
some freaking cheese steaks!

399
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,789
Max, please take that down.
It's so embarrassing.

400
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,030
Nobody here knows
anything about me.

401
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,270
They didn't know me either, chicken.

402
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,159
Hey, who you callin' chicken?

403
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,595
Me. That was Antonia's
nickname for me.

404
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,955
- You know who I am?
- Of course, I do.

405
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,475
Antonia's little chick,
her peep.

406
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,835
She loved you.

407
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,389
And she loved making you
that costume.

408
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,757
Took the whole kitchen table up
with all those sequins...

409
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,632
But she knew you deserved
to sparkle.

410
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,110
She loved you so much,
I couldn't even begin to complain.

411
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,311
I'm so sorry.
What was your name?

412
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,358
I'm Meg O'Hara.
I was her roommate.

413
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,430
And lover.

414
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,435
We were together 30 years.

415
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,750
BOTH: The military!

416
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,757
I know, right?

417
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,069
I mean, come on.

418
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,550
That's me with my arm
around her on that tank.

419
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,393
And the family
still had no clue.

420
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,028
Vintage lez, very cool.

421
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,474
I know Toni would have
wanted you to have these.

422
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,111
Oh, thanks for coming, chicken.

423
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,308
You're probably
the only person in the world

424
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,233
who loved her as purely
as I did.

425
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,831
Max, look.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,149
Christmas.

427
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,669
And my birthday.

428
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,035
And the Teen Choice Awards.

429
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,677
I'm sorry for your loss.

430
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,076
Thank you.

431
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,160
Philly cheese steaks
for everybody!

432
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,594
And you really haven't lived

433
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,398
until you've driven
two hours in a Chevy

434
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,391
with nine cheese steaks
and a gassy animal.

435
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,915
What?
I ate mine in the car.

436
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,911
Hey, Earl, you missed
one hell of a funeral.

437
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,155
You should have come.

438
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,469
There were some
hot octogenarians,

439
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,908
and I got a definite
jungle fever vibe

440
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,115
from one of them.

441
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,272
Girl, at my age, you don't go
anywhere near funerals.

442
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,839
You accidentally doze off,

443
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
you spend six hours digging
yourself out of the ground.

444
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,471
Hey, how you
holding up, chicken?

445
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,874
I'm okay. Thanks.

446
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,189
And Max, when I die,

447
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,118
I don't care who else
is at my funeral,

448
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,230
as long as you're there.

449
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,589
Of course, I'll be there.

450
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,479
The murderer always shows up
to throw off the cops.

451
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,358
Also, save the money
on a casket

452
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,988
and just toss me in a hole
wearing Dior and a smokey eye.

453
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,628
Unless I'm fat,
then burn me.

454
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,028
Well, I don't want a funeral.

455
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,077
When I die, just shove
my corpse into a cannon

456
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,515
and blow me directly
into the Trump Casino.

457
