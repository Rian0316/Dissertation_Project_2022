1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,094
UN Owen is unknown.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,147
We must all have
something in common.

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,107
Someone who knows us all.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,179
It's the poem.
It's the poem, don't you see?

5
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,123
No-one's coming for us.
This is the end.

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,135
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:18,131
I do. I am in love with him.

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,175
"One chopped himself in half
and then there were six."

9
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,187
So she's right. It is the poem!

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,143
We have sharp minds.
We should stay together.

11
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,163
It was locked.

12
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,139
Which means there must be
a master key.

13
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,099
Any one of us could have had
the key.

14
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,091
Any one of us could have the gun.

15
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:38,095
The killer is not out there.

16
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,183
The killer is in here.

17
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,177
It is one of us.

18
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,137
FAINT THUNDERCLAP

19
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,117
THUNDERCLAP

20
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:15,145
THUNDERCLAP

21
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,095
Look how happy Cyril is now.

22
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,151
Hugo always works wonders.

23
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,123
He is the most marvellous man.

24
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,111
He seems very nice.

25
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:34,115
I really can't imagine many would be
as kind, under the circumstances.

26
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,109
What circumstances?

27
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,119
Well, I had no idea I was pregnant
when my husband died.

28
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,123
So Hugo, as the nephew,
stood to inherit.

29
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,167
And when little Cyril popped out,
that was it for Hugo's hopes. Hm!

30
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,143
What he needs is some rich girl
loaded down with Daddy's money,

31
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,167
but he's a romantic.

32
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,167
Wants to marry for love.

33
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,119
But how can he when he doesn't have
a penny?

34
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:02,185
Love, Miss Claythorne,
is a very costly pursuit.

35
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,131
Oh, well done, Cyril! Oh!

36
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,167
OLMA CHUCKLES

37
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,181
I might go and play with them.

38
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,155
Ah, hello.

39
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,101
Looks like we've got
some reinforcements, Cyril.

40
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,187
Ready, old thing?

41
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,123
Ready? I don't think
Miss Claythorne can hit a ball.

42
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,121
- Girls can't, Uncle Hugo.
- Well, we'll have to see.

43
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,131
Oh, shot!

44
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,151
Over here! Quick, quick!

45
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:37,095
Quick, she's going to get all
the way around. Come on now.

46
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,107
HUGO LAUGHS

47
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,165
Well done! Almost.

48
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,107
We can't just sit here
doing nothing!

49
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,107
What are we supposed to do?

50
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,127
Light a fire on the headland,
signal for help?

51
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,125
Not in this weather.

52
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:00,127
Where's... where's she going?
Where are you going?

53
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,103
To make tea. I'll bring it in.

54
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,187
What else are you going to bring in?
A knife from the kitchen?

55
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,095
The gun from wherever
you've hidden it?

56
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,187
And what are you going to be
putting in the tea?

57
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,163
She's going to wipe out
all four of us!

58
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:14,127
There'll be lemon in the tea.

59
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,187
I-I won't bring a knife
and I don't have the gun.

60
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,183
Even if I did, I wouldn't be killing
you all at the same time, would I?

61
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:22,187
- How do we know that?! - Because it's
one by one and in a particular way,

62
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,163
or have you not been paying
attention?

63
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,155
And nowhere on that does it say
anything about a gun, does it,

64
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,143
you idiotic, cretinous bastard?!

65
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,111
SLOW HAND CLAP

66
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,131
PHILIP CHUCKLES
I'll come with you.

67
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,169
No!

68
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:40,135
No. We go... singularly,
or in a group.

69
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,171

THUNDERCLAP

72
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,185
I hear you were one for the black
square and the rope, Judge Wargrave.

73
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,155
When it was appropriate, yes.

74
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:59,167
Tubs here tells me you used to watch
all the hangings you'd ordered.

75
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,175
Is that true?

76
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,095
You really want to stop calling me
that.

77
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,177
Is that true, Judge?

78
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,133
I had the power to condemn men
and women to death for their crimes.

79
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,185
With great power
comes great responsibility.

80
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,171
I believe that to look away
as that power is exercised

81
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:23,117
was both irresponsible and cowardly.

82
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,125
Did you watch Edward Seton hang?

83
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:36,159
I remember Edward Seton,
from the newspapers.

84
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,141
Everyone said he was innocent.

85
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,159
He wasn't.

86
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,109
He left diaries.

87
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,115
They proved a warped
and corrupted mind.

88
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,095
He believed his victims
were full of filth

89
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,185
and that he was cleansing the world
of their stain.

90
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:59,187
Taunting the police with... clues
and misdirections excited him.

91
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,145
As much as torture and sadism.

92
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:06,179
He was guilty and you passed
the right verdict.

93
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,163
Why didn't you go and see him?

94
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,133
I did.

95
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,131
It was unsettling.

96
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,093
Different.

97
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,137
He refused the hood.

98
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,261
He wanted me to see his face.

99
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,135
Perhaps to impute there was
some commonality between us,

100
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,159
perhaps to... laugh at me.

101
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,095
Laugh at you?

102
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,113
Yes.

103
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,113
At justice.

104
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,145
It meant nothing to him.

105
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,101
He wasn't cowed by it, or by me.

106
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,149
I was nothing.

107
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,161
I would soon be forgotten,
a footnote in history.

108
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,139
Whereas he, with his legacy of blood
and horror,

109
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,113
would be remembered for ever.

110
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,097
Well, it worked.

111
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,157
He haunts me still.

112
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,163
But... laughter or not,

113
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,189
justice came, as it always does.

114
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:25,093
And the world is free
of his terrible darkness.

115
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,139
This is ridiculous!

116
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,135
I mean, we can't just sit around
doing nothing!

117
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,121
Very well, Doctor.

118
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,157
We said singly, or in a group.

119
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,179
I'm going to read.

120
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:58,185
I'm sorry, Dr Armstrong,
but your agitation tires me greatly.

Justice came.

124
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,111
The killer and Wargrave
having common cause.

125
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:36,103
The same thrill... from
handing out death.

126
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,139
You took the piss
when I said the judge.

127
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,115
Yes, well, now I think different.

128
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:44,185
How many men has he seen dangle?
What does that do to someone?

129
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,151
He's on his own.

130
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,177
Could be plotting anything.

131
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,169
Stop it, will you?! Just stop it!

00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,127
Breathing and smoking.

135
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,173
Scratching, fidgeting and pacing.

136
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,157
I'm going to bed.

137
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,141
Singly, or in a group.

138
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,141

155
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,131
Here. For Christ's sake,
it's sal volatile. Smelling salts.

Breathe slowly. In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,095

00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:22,105
I thought there was somebody

00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,175
Here, have some brandy.

00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:30,125

00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,123
Good for you, Vera.

165
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,111
What, you think I've done
something to it?

166
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:41,145
I'm going to go and fetch another
bottle that hasn't been opened.

167
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:47,091
- I need some water.
- This brandy's all right.

168
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,155
I haven't done anything to it.

169
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,143
Brandy's good for shock,
that's why I got it.

170
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,117
(He called her Vera.)

171
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,135
Lombard. That's the second time.

172
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,169
There's something going on

What's that for?

175
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,167
I don't know. A chandelier, maybe.

176
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,103
Like downstairs.

177
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,111
A chandelier in the bedroom?

178
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:21,091
Well, it's posh people, innit?

179
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,107
They put a chandelier anywhere.

180
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:26,103
Put a chandelier in a pigsty

- Hm!

You're an arrogant arsehole, you.

Ooh! Bloody hell!
Sorry, Miss Claythorne.

Well, what are you doing?

194
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:15,155
Well, his head needs to be wrapped
if we're going to move him.

195
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,119
He's right.

196
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,111
We don't want his brains

Don't use your jacket, Armstrong.
I'll find something else.

Shot?

199

- Well, look at him!

206
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:19,127
We didn't hear the shot.

That's more your field of expertise.

How would I have had the time
to go downstairs,

211
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,095
grab a bottle of brandy,

212
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,091
quickly put a slug in Wargrave,
making sure that nobody heard him,

213
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,159
dress him up and make it back
upstairs again?

- Yes, we did.
- Did you find him?

347
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,115
Did you chuck him off the cliff?

348
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:31,123
No, Tubs, I didn't find him

349
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,093

- Did you? - No!

No.

00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,139
Armstrong said that and all.

361
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:05,107
It's been a long night.

362
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:09,131
You're letting the booze and powder
do the thinking for you, Tubs.

363
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,121
I've told you to stop calling me
that!

364
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,183
Your first name's William, isn't it?

365
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:18,187
Do you get Will, or...?

366
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,101
Bill. I get Bill.

367
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,115
Well, Bill,

368
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,159
whose idea was it to put music on,

369
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:31,105
to get drunk so we'd all pass out
and not hear anything?

370
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:36,129
- Armstrong.
- And who did you first suspect?

371
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,173
Who did you get the scent on,
right from the off?

372
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,161
(Armstrong.)

373
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,119
Red herring.

374
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,147
He's been playing us off each other
from the start.

375
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,127
And he's still alive.

376
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:56,123
Because people don't just vanish,
not on an island this size.

377
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,181
He's still alive.

378
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,165
I've got an allotment at home.

379
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,129
In Edmonton.

380
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,119
I love it.

381
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,097
It's my little patch of paradise.

382
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,137
That's the best thing in the world,
just sitting there, watching it all.

383
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,167
Growing away.

384
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,159
Hm!

385
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:29,101
Cup of tea from the flask and a bit
of bread and a bit of cheese and...

386
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,157
...radish that you pulled
from the ground a moment before.

387
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,149
Great, big, peppery radish.

388
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,129
Simple things.

389
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:47,145
Good things.

390
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:56,117
I wish I'd chucked that letter
from Ulick Norman Owen in the bin!

391
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,143
And it serves me right,

392
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:04,159
trying to earn... a bit of cash
on the sly.

393
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,121
It serves us all right.

394
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,151
Are we dead already?

395
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,131
What?

396
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:19,173
Perhaps we're dead already
and we just don't realise it.

397
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,145
And this is hell.

398
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,143
We're in hell.

399
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:28,141
And we're being punished
for what we done.

400
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,177
Because I did kill him.

401
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,157
Landor.

402
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:41,109
I stomped him till he was pulp.

403
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,159
His own mother couldn't see him.

404
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:47,141
Couldn't say goodbye.

405
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,097
I murdered him, all right.

406
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:58,093
He was helpless and I didn't stop.

407
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,297
He must've been so frightened.

408
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:05,183
Just... just a young lad.

409
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:08,101
HE SOBS

410
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:12,171
I've got a tomato crop that's got to
be harvested. Who's going to do it?

411
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,159
What's going to happen to
my allotment?

412
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:18,119
Hey. Hey, come on, Tubs.

413
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,153
We're not done yet.

414
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:23,143
It's us three against him.
We can hold our own.

415
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:26,155
And someone has to come for us soon.
They... they have to.

416
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:28,135
Mm-hm. That's the spirit.

417
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,159
Who's going to come for us?

418
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:34,141
That Narracott never turned up
when he was supposed to.

419
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:37,135
Reckon he was paid off.

420
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,107
We light a fire.

421
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,179
On the cliff.
Someone's bound to see it.

422
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:44,115
OK. We're going to need supplies.

423
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,167
I don't want to spend another night
in this house, do you?

424
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:49,105
(I reckon we're being watched.)

425
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,145
We are.

426
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:22,181
- Let's go.
- OK.

427
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,117
Come on, Tubs, let's go!

Stay here.

There's something down there.

00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:23,105
Armstrong.

00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,103

Not here.

I need to find a better view.

No, no, no. We... we can't leave him
like this.

451
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,175
It's not right. We can't leave him!

452
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:52,095
Yes, we can.

453
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:55,103
No, when the boat comes, Philip,

No! No, I'm not going to kill you,

There's somebody on this island
and they're going to kill us both
if you don't give me that gun.

There's no-one else,
you've killed them all!

If only I hadn't turned away

You're fast. You're strong.
You sprint.

502
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,163
You turn your back for a moment and
you couldn't catch up with Cyril?

00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,165
I lied about the success
of my surgery.

539
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,163
The mass, the tumour is spreading.

540
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:44,183
There's nothing to be done
but await the inevitable.

541
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:47,149
It's quite extraordinarily painful.

542
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,179
Well... not long now, though, hm?

543
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,143
Why are you doing this?

544
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:56,149
Because justice comes to all.

545
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,145
I told you that,
were you not listening?

546
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,187
The evidence that led me to convict
Edward Seton

547
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:06,161
was considered too terrible
to be made public.

548
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:11,093
It was the stuff of nightmares.

549
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,137
Really.

550
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,101
And where others were revolted...

551
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,141
...Miss Claythorne, I was fascinated.

552
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,167
And when Seton looked into my eyes,

553
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,157
he could see that I was thrilled.

554
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,161
He knew that I was a kindred spirit.

555
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,161
And when his neck snapped...

556
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,187
...I felt as if I'd been handed
a gift.

557
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,119
No. No!

558
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,179
You don't mean any of this.

559
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:50,115
You are a good man. Moral.

560
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:52,131
Moral?

561
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,139
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

562
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,111
Maybe there's something in that.

563
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:00,093
There are differences
between Seton and myself.

564
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,105
All his victims were innocent.

565
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,181
You are all guilty.

566
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:10,143
Now, imagine.

567
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:14,107
The detectives arrive to find
a house full of slaughter

568
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,173
and the handiwork of UN Owen
everywhere.

569
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:23,171
But UN Owen himself
is nowhere to be seen.

570
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:26,095
But who else could have fired
the final shot

571
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:29,101
that ended the life
of the unimpeachable judge?

572
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:34,133
Ten bodies and no murderer.

573
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:38,103
How could he have disappeared?

574
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:39,185
SHE CHOKES

575
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:43,157
It's so unfathomable.

576
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,165
They'll be worrying about it
for years.

577
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:51,171
No! No, wait!

578
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:56,095
There's... there's no... there's
no more bullets!

579
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,143
There... there can be no final shot

580
00:51:58,145 --> 00:52:01,091
because the gun is empty.

581
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:02,177
There are no more bullets.

582
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,115
Damn!

583
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,131
That's all spoiled.

584
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,159
No, it's not spoiled.

585
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:12,143
Yes, it is. There are corpses
everywhere and only me left.

586
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,091
No, not just you. There's me!

587
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,153
The two of us, together.

588
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:21,183
We'll... we'll say it was Philip.

589
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,155
That he was mad.

590
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,135
Oh, he was quite the sanest
of the lot, I thought.

591
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:28,135
He was insane.

592
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:31,181
He... he killed us all
and I shot him.

593
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:35,133
I shot him to defend us.

594
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,179
It was all Philip Lombard.

595
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:40,127
Huh! Hm!

596
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,131
You took him as your lover.

597
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,131
Yes.

598
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,139
- Got his blood on your feet.
- Self-defence!

599
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:49,109
(We'll say that.)

600
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:53,165
We'll say that. They'll believe us.

601
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:56,137
They believed me last time.

602
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,105
SHE GASPS

603
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,109
What a beguiling woman you are,
Miss Claythorne.

604
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:08,093
Vera.

605
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:13,117
Quite my favourite, really.

606
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:16,173
There's no final bullet, Judge.

607
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,125
But I can save us both.

608
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:24,189
I'll keep your secret
and I'll save us both.

609
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:29,097
Just let me down. Please!

610
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:34,173
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

611
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:48,125
You forgot the one that shot me.
