1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:06,623
Item 28:
your pet name for me.

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,992
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

3
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:11,878
I submitted you
a notarized list.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,965
I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and
"Flakey" are not acceptable.

5
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,701
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob""

6
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:21,271
you don't like "Fester"-- you're
just impossible to please.

7
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:22,789
We'll come back to that one.

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,508
This brings us
to the final item

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,010
in our annual State
of the Relationship Summit.

10
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:29,780
Item 29: Valentine's Day.

11
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:32,933
Ah, the worst for last. Hmm.

12
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:36,103
Classic Flakey.

13
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,856
Before you get upset, I believe
I've come up with a way for us

14
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:42,225
to celebrate the occasion
that we both can enjoy.

15
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,744
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

16
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,531
but you go ahead--
end with one.

17
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,317
I propose we spend a weekend

18
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,352
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

19
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,739
I hate every word
in that sentence.

20
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:59,926
Including "in""
"at," "we" and "a""

21
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,995
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

22
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:04,664
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,083
to eat with strangers
at your table.

24
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,201
One step ahead of you--

25
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:09,970
Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

26
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,054
Oh, very well.

27
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,339
What are the
sleeping arrangements?

28
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:15,175
We've only been dating
for three years.

29
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:19,246
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

30
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,647
I got you your own room.

31
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,318
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

32
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,872
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like
you're bathing inside a monster.

33
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,888
Look, I appreciate the effort,

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,224
but I'm still
unclear how this trip

35
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:33,076
is supposed to be
enjoyable for me.

36
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,079
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

37
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,932
on a fully functioning
vintage train.

38
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,234
Vintage?

39
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,936
Be specific.

40
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,172
An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive

41
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,374
leading a train
of meticulously restored

42
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:50,093
1915 Pullman
first-class coaches.

43
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:52,846
(gasps)
Wow.

44
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,682
I'm feeling the
urge to hug you.

45
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,852
And one... and two...

46
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,937
All right, Gollum,
we're good.

57
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,707
Are you sure you guys don't want
to come with us to Napa?

58
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,125
You could probably
still get a room.

59
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,711
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

60
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,212
Plus, I'm not sure
it's a great idea

61
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,781
to take Penny to where wine
comes from. (chuckles)

62
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,552
What? It's a joke.

63
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,954
Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

64
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,307
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem--

65
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:52,926
it's all for laughs.

66
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:56,847
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

67
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:03,186
Howard, which pocket watch
will you be wearing

68
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:04,855
for dinner on the train?

69
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:12,662
I'm sorry, what?

70
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,831
Oh, I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

71
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,367
it will be embarrassing.

72
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:21,121
I don't own a pocket watch.

73
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:23,323
Oh, my.

74
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:27,210
Well, then my apologies for
bringing up this sore spot.

75
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,632
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

76
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,000
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

77
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,219
You have Valentine's plans?!

78
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,172
Which came out sounding
way more surprised than I meant.

79
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,775
L-Let me try that again.
You have Val...

80
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,560
See? I can't do it.

81
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:47,147
I don't have plans
which is why I booked time

82
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,982
on the big telescope that night.

83
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,533
Well, an evening
looking at the stars--

84
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,035
that's still
kind of romantic.

85
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,486
Except I'll be alone.
I'm trying to put

86
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,406
lipstick on a pig here.
Work with me.

87
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,859
We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Yeah.

88
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,711
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

89
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,863
to see some action, so if
you guys happen to have sex,

90
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,916
it's cool if she stays
in the room.

91
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,469
Hey, same goes for the two
of you with Amy.

92
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,566
What do you think,
Sheldon?

93
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,902
It's magnificent.

94
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,605
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

95
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,106
I'm so glad you like it.

96
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,441
I'm prepared to say

97
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:35,495
I love it, as soon as I confirm
there are no hobos aboard.

98
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:39,833
LEONARD:
Okay.

99
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,286
Raj, I got it.

100
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:44,788
Bye.

101
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:48,458
That was your daddy.

102
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,264
He wanted me to say that he
misses... Why am I doing this?

103
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,850
Happy Valentine's Day!

104
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,885
Ooh, flowers <i>and</i> chocolates?
(chuckles)

105
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:02,305
Somebody's trying to get
me out of my panties. (laughs)

106
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:05,141
Don't be surprised if you find
five chocolates missing

107
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:07,694
and three gross coconut ones
with a bite taken out.

108
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,231
It came that way
when I bought it.

109
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,066
Got you a little
something, too.

110
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,317
Aw.

111
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,286
Jewelry.

112
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,204
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,873
Lakers tickets?!

114
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,442
(gasps)

115
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:24,127
It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

116
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,795
who will actually enjoy it.
Aw!

117
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:29,282
You are the best boyfriend ever.

118
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:31,801
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

119
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,802
(laughs)

120
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:35,788
(moaning with pleasure)

121
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,390
Should we take this
little party to the bedroom?

122
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,726
Mm, don't have to-- we have
the whole place to ourselves.

123
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,128
Oh, that's true.
In fact, if you want,

124
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,214
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

125
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,887
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

126
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,489
To the bedroom!

127
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,656
Yeah!

128
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:02,165
And for the entrée, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

129
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,199
Do you have any questions?

130
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,617
Uh, I do.

131
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:08,338
Uh, does this train car have the
original link-and-pin coupler

132
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,874
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

133
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,927
I'm sorry, I meant questions
about the food.

134
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,762
Oh, of course. Um...

135
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:18,548
he seafood risotto
being served on a train car

136
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,266
with the original
link-and-pin coupler

137
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,268
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

138
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:26,056
I-I think we're
gonna need a minute.

139
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,477
Fun fact: it's neither.

140
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,679
They actually

141
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,981
use the AAR type E coupler.

142
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,683
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

143
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,737
you'll hear the characteristic
click-pshht-thunk

144
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,956
of the knuckle.

145
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,410
Get out of town.

146
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:52,031
Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

147
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,370
Hey, Cinnamon,

148
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:00,039
guess who just did it
human style.

149
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,042
Oh, my God!

150
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,311
It's a little late,
but I'll take it.

151
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:08,064
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.

152
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,983
That's really bad for dogs.

153
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,235
Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
We gotta get her

154
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:14,687
to a vet right now.
I don't have a vet.

155
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,690
I have a podiatrist,
an optometrist, an allergist,

156
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:21,528
a dermatologist, a urologist.
You'd think I'd have a vet.

157
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,079
Okay. There's one not far
from here. Come on. Let's go.

158
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,897
Okay. (groans)
Koothrappali was right.

159
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,250
We should have
let her watch.

160
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:32,122
(gasps) Do another one,
do another one!

161
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,439
Okay.

162
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,041
Here's my impression
of the Amtrak

163
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:37,927
Acela barreling
down the Eastern Corridor.

164
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,597
(imitates clank and whoosh
of train chugging)

165
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:49,205
It's like there's a train
in your mouth.

166
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:50,857
Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,776
I've got one.
Um, the Amtrak Wolverine

168
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,979
coming into Chicago.
(clears throat)

169
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:58,281
(soft chugging)

170
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,985
(imitates whistle blowing)

171
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,989
I've been on that train.

172
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,374
And I just was again.

173
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:11,461
Hey, see if you guys
can guess this one.

174
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:14,247
Bang! Splat! Thud.

175
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,418
How many trains
have you been on?

176
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,971
Tons. A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

177
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:25,275
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

178
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,345
Wow. Your life's amazing.

179
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,231
Not always.

180
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:34,434
A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

181
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:37,904
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

182
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,410
Why do I even try?

183
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,029
I'm gonna fix
this right now.

184
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:49,582
Okay. Just make it look
like an accident.

185
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,536
Excuse me.
You are

186
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:55,371
at Valentine's dinner
with your girlfriend.

187
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,590
Now get back over there
and be with her.

188
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,326
You're right.

189
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,662
That was
insensitive of me.

190
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:04,764
I have to go back
to my table now.

191
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,099
You should join us.

192
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,350
All right.

193
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,803
Great.

194
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,005
Now there's two of 'em.

195
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,569
How much chocolate
did she eat?

196
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,187
A whole box.
Well, to be fair,

197
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:29,290
you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

198
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,676
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

199
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,411
(both chuckle)

200
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,447
I'm sorry,
is this a joke to you?

201
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,398
No.

202
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,584
Maybe to her.

203
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,438
How big
a box of chocolate was it?

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,956
Uh, something like
this. I don't know.

205
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,959
It came free with
a full tank of gas.

206
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,428
Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

207
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,863
Do you know
how much gas is?

208
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:52,714
Hey!

209
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,433
Sorry.
Sorry.

210
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:59,086
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you okay?!

211
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,355
I can't believe you two!

212
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,140
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

213
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:04,425
If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

214
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,427
and scrap them for parts!

215
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,763
You're the owner?

216
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,615
Owner, father, soul mate,

217
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:13,952
and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

218
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:17,922
Well, she's not
throwing up,

219
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,207
which is a good sign.

220
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,543
So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

221
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:23,244
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

222
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:24,829
Okay?
Okay. Okay, thank you.

223
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,764
Oh, if she's scared,
you can sing to her.

224
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,783
She likes Katy Perry.

225
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:29,951
Oh, but don't
do "Firework""

226
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,786
That gets her all riled up.

227
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,404
Got it.

228
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,640
Should have been a dentist.

229
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,645
Okay, what was
the best four-ten-four

230
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,296
U.S. locomotive
ever built?

231
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,632
Trick question.
There never was one.

232
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:45,850
Or was there?

233
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:48,069
What?!

234
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:53,091
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

235
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,943
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

236
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,811
solving the problem
of the Q-1,

237
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,963
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

238
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,415
In what world is

239
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,834
a four-four-six-four
a four-ten-four?

240
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,586
A world I don't
want to live in!

241
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:08,473
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

242
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:11,259
Hold on to your
conductor's hat.

243
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,127
You crank the second
and third axles,

244
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,513
creating a pair
of internal connecting rods,

245
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,164
and boom--
four-ten-four.

246
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,100
If you think
about it, the Q-2

247
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,269
was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

248
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,955
I may never <i>stop</i>
thinking about it.

249
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,624
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

250
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,175
Better than you think.

251
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:32,680
You know, if you ask nicely,

252
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,282
they'll let you visit
the engine room.

253
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:35,516
(gasps)

254
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:37,118
I never want
this day to end.

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,171
It's feeling like
it never will.

256
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:41,456
Come on.

257
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,660
Hey, did I tell you
what happened to me at UPS?

258
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:52,483
As if Valentine’s Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

259
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:54,719
And with cheap chocolate,
no less?

260
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,221
It wasn't cheap.

261
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,223
It was free.

262
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,091
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

263
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,493
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

264
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:05,230
Oh, no, come on.
It was a while.

265
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,649
It was a while.

266
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,070
Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?

267
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,387
She's responding well.

268
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,090
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

269
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,409
All right. Uh, would-would
it be okay for me to see her?

270
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:19,777
We're usually
in bed by now,

271
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,313
and I want her to
know that I'm here.

272
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:25,416
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

273
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,837
It's okay.
I sleep with my dog, too.

274
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,457
We're not supposed
to let people in back,

275
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,809
but I think
I can make an exception.

276
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,410
Thank you.
Come on.

277
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,430
By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
Oh, yeah?

278
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,932
And I don't care

279
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,934
what that obnoxious
parrot back there says.

280
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,103
I crushed it.

281
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:48,022
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

282
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,925
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

283
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:53,695
so what do you know?

284
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,685
You okay?

285
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:03,621
Why? Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo

286
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:05,657
with some weirdo?

287
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,927
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

288
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,114
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

289
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:16,617
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

290
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:19,554
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

291
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:23,308
I'm going to the Lego store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

292
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,312
See? It's not
just Sheldon.

293
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:30,581
They're all idiots.

294
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,433
She's right.

295
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:33,868
BERNADETTE:
So, your boyfriend's

296
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,069
a fixer-upper.

297
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:36,237
Most of them are.

298
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,405
I mean, look at this guy.

299
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,606
You think he
came like this?

300
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:41,075
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

301
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,579
Now, he's been to space.

302
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:46,864
That's all me.

303
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,351
I had a little
to do with it.

304
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,003
Oh, sure you did.

305
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,822
Who's Mama's
big space man?

306
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,659
(giggling):
I am.

307
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:06,751
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

308
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:09,854
Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

309
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,194
How long should we stay?
I don't know.

310
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,278
I'm kind of hungry.

311
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,147
I saw a Thai place next door.

312
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,865
Oh. Okay.

313
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,700
Oh. Oh. Hey!
How's she doing?

314
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,019
How is everything?
Yeah.

315
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:27,138
She's gonna be okay; they're
gonna let me take her home.

316
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,339
Oh, good.
So I want you

317
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,707
to keep a close eye on her

318
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,858
for the next 24 hours.

319
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,444
Here are a few warning signs
to look out for,

320
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:36,066
and if you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

321
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:36,677
Oh.

322
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:39,200
Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

323
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:41,352
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

324
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:43,154
Yes, thank you
for all your help.

325
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:44,305
Yeah. I'm sorry if
you didn't think

326
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,539
we were taking
it seriously.

327
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,657
We love animals.

328
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,142
Oh, do you guys own any pets?

329
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:49,060
No.

330
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,512
Good.

331
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,236
I love you so much.

332
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:01,438
I love you, too.

333
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,383
Sorry.
Sorry.

334
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,118
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

335
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,122
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

336
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,708
It was crazy.

337
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,910
Dare I say "loco"?

338
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,429
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

339
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:27,631
The conductor said
as soon as he gets off work,

340
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,516
he can come back
to the bed and breakfast

341
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:30,768
and play his banjo for us.

342
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,588
Okay. I need to speak to
my boyfriend in private,

343
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,089
like, right now.

344
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,725
There's a car
with a glass roof.

345
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,393
Want to go look
at the stars?

346
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:40,761
Oh, that sounds
so romantic.

347
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:43,063
Oh, give it a rest!

348
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:45,282
Let's go.

349
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,504
Why are you still here?

350
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,089
Excuse me.

351
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,941
I think you're being
a little rude.

352
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,159
<i>I'm</i> being rude?

353
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,910
You've been rude to me
this entire evening.

354
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,746
How is that possible?

355
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:02,116
I've hardly spoken to you
since we got on the train.

356
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:05,753
I'm detecting a little friction
between you two,

357
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,172
and I don't want
to be a third rail.

358
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:10,607
Get it?

359
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,726
I get it.

360
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,312
Leave!

361
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,600
What is your problem?

362
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:20,851
It's Valentine's Day.

363
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,936
We're supposed
to be having a romantic weekend.

364
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,072
Oh, really? Because
I remember you saying

365
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,941
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

366
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:31,078
Did you mean that, or were you
just trying to trick me?

367
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,330
Fine, it's true.

368
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,249
I deserve romance,

369
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,335
and I didn't know
how else to make it happen.

370
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:42,373
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

371
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,176
Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm.

372
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:49,630
Grape juice that burns.

373
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,349
Uh, now let's gaze
into each other's eyes, hmm?

374
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,667
You blinked. I win.

375
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,519
Sheldon...
Let's see. What's next?

376
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,688
Oh, kissing's romantic.

377
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:17,357
That was nice.

378
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,960
Good.

379
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:24,882
Um...

380
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:28,635
the conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

381
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:32,172
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

382
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,176
Okay, have fun.

383
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,513
Do you want to come with me?

384
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:43,350
Really? I do.

385
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,906
Hey, guys, wait up!

386
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:00,339
There you go.

387
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:03,976
(in silly voice):
All cozy wozy.

388
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:08,881
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

389
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,019
Hmm. "Rajesh, I was dreading
Valentine's Day.

390
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:16,823
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

391
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,494
Cinnamon, she-she gave me
her phone number.

392
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,446
If I knew it was that easy,

393
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:26,182
I would have considered
poisoning you months ago.

394
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,119
Oh, what should I say?

395
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,705
Oh, I know. I'll point out
her name's Yvette,

396
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:34,290
and that she's a vet.

397
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,591
(laughing):
That's hysterical.

398
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,093
She'll love it.

399
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,964
Hello.
Oh, hey.

400
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,717
You're back. How was your trip?
It was wonderful!

401
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,685
Great. What did you do?

402
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,220
I made a new friend

403
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,272
who likes trains
as much as I do,

404
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:51,140
uh, I kissed Amy on the lips,

405
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:52,108
and, uh,

406
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,442
the conductor played his banjo
for me.

407
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,560
Good night.

408
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:57,046
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

409
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,948
I'm gonna need
more details.

410
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,534
Oh, well, my new friend's name
was Eric.

411
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:05,288
Um, Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

412
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,455
Oh...

413
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,707
the banjo-playing conductor

414
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,041
was missing a finger,

415
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:11,244
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

416
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,996
No, hang on.
Hang on.

417
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:16,499
Are all those things
equal to you?

418
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,467
Hmm.

419
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:20,586
It never occurred to me
to pick a favorite.

420
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:23,506
Well, give it a go.

421
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:27,310
I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

422
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,296
Additional data. You dog!

423
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,098
I'm not sure how
listening to other

424
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,017
nine-fingered banjo players
makes me dog, but all right.
