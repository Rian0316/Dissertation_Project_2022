1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:01,807
Rebekah, voice-over: My brothers and I

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,652
are the first vampires in history... 

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,974
The Originals.

4
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:08,290
300 years ago, we called New Orleans home.

5
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,020
I was happy here... 

6
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:12,881
for a time.

7
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,096
Now we've returned,

8
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:16,596
only to find a miracle... 

9
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,181
Niklaus, the girl is carrying your child.

10
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:21,234
Rebekah, voice-over: And with
it, a new responsibility... 

11
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,069
I will always protect you.

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,385
You have my word on that.

13
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,284
Rebekah, voice-over: But
our family has many enemies.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,451
Klaus destroyed everything good in my life.

15
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,538
So I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,729
Rebekah, voice-over: These
threats should have united us.

17
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:35,255
Instead, Klaus has driven us apart.

18
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,422
Why should I help you after
what you did to Elijah?

19
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,939
You're my family.

20
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:41,442
Marcel: Klaus will never
stop trying to control you.

21
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,576
What do you want?

22
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:44,445
Rebekah, voice-over: My
brother expects my loyalty,

23
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:45,978
as he has for 1,000 years,

24
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,770
but now, perhaps, it's time
to make a different choice.

25
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:52,916
[Blues music playing]

26
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,117
Rebekah: I should never
have come back here.

27
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,965
This is the town where I fell in love

28
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:05,929
and where love failed us.

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,577
I assume you know who I'm talking about.

30
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,667
You should know, Marcel and I aren't on the

31
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:13,512
best of terms right now.

32
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,729
But you are an active priest, are you not,

33
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,880
ready and able to hear my confession?

34
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,195
Usually, the word "willing"

35
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,463
falls somewhere in that sentence.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,278
Are you even Catholic?

37
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,051
I've been on this earth for 1,000 years.

38
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:29,548
I can't say for certain that I believe

39
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,543
in anything like a God, but

40
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:33,811
I need absolution

41
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,015
from someone,

42
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,853
anyone.

43
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:42,324
So will you hear my confession or not?

44
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,772
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

45
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:51,907
I am a liar,

46
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:54,371
a betrayer.

47
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,007
I have conspired against my own blood,

48
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:02,277
and I doubt even your God could save me.

49
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:21,571
Have you spoken to our
good friend Marcel today?

50
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:22,893
No. Should I have?

51
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,770
Well, he's been mysteriously silent,

52
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,834
avoiding me, some might say.

53
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,251
I thought, perhaps, he may have whispered

54
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,238
reasons into your ear

55
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,882
along with all of those sweet nothings.

56
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,438
If I see him, I'll be sure to ask

57
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,823
if he's still sore at you.

58
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,312
Let me give a voice to
that look in your eyes.

59
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,283
"My saintly, noble brother

60
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,527
lies writhing in agony in the bayou,

61
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,948
victim of my bastard brother's bite

62
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,995
when just one or two drops

63
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,330
of his blood would ease his pain."

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,560
One the contrary, Nik.

65
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,280
I am simply enjoying my brekkie

66
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,861
waiting for Elijah's healthy return.

67
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,135
Oh, come on, Rebekah.

68
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,450
You've been giving me the
devil's eye all morning.

69
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:02,576
Out with it.

70
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,391
Perhaps I'm concerned

71
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,666
that if I voice my opinion

72
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,034
about what you did to Elijah,

73
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,537
I will end up on the wrong
side of your toxic hybrid teeth.

74
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,174
Poppycock. I would never bite you.

75
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:16,052
Elijah made some very offensive accusations

76
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,005
about my intentions towards my child.

77
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:20,572
He deserves a day or two of discomfort.

78
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,608
Besides, you know my preferred method

79
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,657
of punishment for your indiscretions

80
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,296
is the dagger.

81
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,164
[Chuckles]

82
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,678
There's something
fundamentally wrong with you.

83
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,169
[Gasping]

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,370
Here. Drink this.

85
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,039
- [Coughing]
- Mm.

86
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,265
Forgive me, please.

87
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,104
It's ok.

88
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,815
Remind me to annihilate your
brother once you're healthy.

89
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,812
Yes. Remind me to remind
you to get in line.

90
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,740
Doesn't help that we decided to shack up

91
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:15,213
in the middle of a swamp, either.

92
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,436
[Elijah coughs]

93
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,432
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

94
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,058
Please just... 

95
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:26,197
return to your reading.

96
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,108
Well, I went through
the whole thing. It's... 

97
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,117
just a regular Bible

98
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,170
with an entry in the family tree

99
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,846
that may or may not be me,

100
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,241
but you know I've been a little busy

101
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:38,411
worrying about you.

102
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:39,663
Hayley, please.

103
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,345
This fever will make me unstable.

104
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,984
Now, once these hallucinations begin,

105
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:45,155
I'll start to see things.

106
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,132
I will start to say things.

107
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,609
You must leave me here.

108
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,411
I'm not leaving you like this.

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,163
[Coughs]

110
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:10,900
[Blues music playing]

111
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,626
All right. I'm here.

112
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,353
Let's do this.

113
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,501
I'll keep this simple.

114
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,224
This kid is an old enemy

115
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,562
of your favorite person Klaus.

116
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,307
Now, he's got plenty to say

117
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:37,603
about what that traitorous

118
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,836
son of a bitch has been
up to behind my back.

119
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,307
Now, for those of you faint of heart,

120
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,897
there's the door

121
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,588
because those who stick around,

122
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,665
you're signing up for battle.

123
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,907
Tyler: You all know Klaus
wasn't always the hybrid.

124
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,382
When he broke the curse that
kept his werewolf side dormant,

125
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,068
somewhere in all that,
certain parts were now able

126
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:07,026
to trump his vampire side,

127
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,199
like the ability to pass
on the werewolf gene.

128
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,295
That's where the werewolf
girl he's been hiding

129
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,483
from you all comes in.

130
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,016
She rolled through my town,

131
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:16,120
pretended to be my friend,

132
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,794
and ended up hooking up with him.

133
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,302
Now she's pregnant with his kid.

134
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:22,756
What the hell is this?

135
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,056
Just listen.

136
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,725
When Klaus became the hybrid,

137
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,144
he figured out a way to
turn full-bred werewolves

138
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,815
into creatures like him.

139
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,836
You're looking at one of them.

140
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:36,726
On the plus side, we had all
the perks of being vampires.

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,417
We were stronger, faster,

142
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:42,226
and the toxins in our bites
could still kill a vampire,

143
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,673
but on the downside, we were loyal to him,

144
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:47,699
like, supernaturally loyal.

145
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,366
Right, and that's why you're here

146
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,772
spilling all his secrets?

147
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:52,655
No. That's the point, Diego.

148
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,096
He figured out a way to break free of it.

149
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,035
And I helped the rest of them, too.

150
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,707
Then Klaus killed them for their betrayal.

151
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:04,225
Because that is what Klaus does.

152
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,623
Don't mind me.

153
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,644
I'm fascinated by this story.

154
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,435
- Hello, Tyler.
- Rebekah.

155
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:16,418
Long time, no see.

156
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,370
What Tyler is about to
tell you is that my brother

157
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,245
can use his baby's blood
to sire more hybrids.

158
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,178
What you will all figure out is that

159
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,268
vampires don't stand a chance.

160
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:31,548
So, Tyler, I assume you
were trying to rally this lot

161
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,387
into making sure the baby isn't born.

162
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:34,889
Yeah.

163
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,315
You don't like it,

164
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:37,873
go ahead and take your brother's side,

165
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,287
but you know I'm right.

166
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:41,715
I believe you've mistaken
the lady's intentions.

167
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,491
Diego: All right. What's going on?

168
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:45,681
You're absolutely right, Tyler.

169
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,690
My brother is a crap
enough individual as it is.

170
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,357
The last thing he needs is
to sire a superior species.

171
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,841
Go on. You can tell them.

172
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,150
She's not here to fight us.

173
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,845
She's here to help us.

174
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,148
That's right,

175
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,756
but first... 

176
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:06,940
[Crack]

177
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:07,942
[Thud]

178
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,399
Whew,

179
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,897
that is enough talk
about harming that baby.

180
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,164
Klaus is the one we're putting a stop to.

181
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,172
Klaus: They have all forsaken me.

182
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:30,066
My siblings are as deceitful and diseased

183
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,240
as my parents ever were,

184
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,131
accusing me

185
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,546
of using my baby for my own gain,

186
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:42,389
trusting others before their own blood.

187
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,878
Ohh, would a laptop kill you?

188
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,205
That typewriter was good
enough for Hemingway.

189
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,394
Can see the resemblance... 

190
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:49,296
booze and random acts of violence.

191
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,018
Elijah and Rebekah have cut to the quick

192
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,007
with their vicious lies about me

193
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,240
when all I've done

194
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,525
is tried to win this battle
of wills over Marcel's control

195
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:01,590
of the quarter in order
to reclaim our home.

196
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,048
Type, please.

197
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,231
What's the point?

198
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:07,159
You just repeat the same
thing over and over again.

199
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,485
Rebekah is out to get you.

200
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,024
Elijah is out to get you.

201
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:12,709
Is there anyone who isn't
plotting your downfall?

202
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,505
I doubt you trust your own reflection.

203
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,263
You know, if the daggers weren't missing,

204
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,414
I would put one in each of their hearts,

205
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,917
rid myself of the burden of my siblings

206
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,737
for a couple of centuries.

207
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:23,882
Look at you,

208
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,628
repeating the same destructive cycles

209
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,281
over and over again.

210
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,046
You are the architect
of your own unhappiness.

211
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,961
I don't remember asking for your advice.

212
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:36,438
Oh, really?

213
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,196
So of all the people in New Orleans,

214
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,142
you choose someone with
a master's in psychology

215
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:41,775
to record your life story.

216
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,151
You're over 1,000 years old.

217
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,716
Pretty damn sure you know how to type.

218
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:47,531
The truth is, you compel me to come here

219
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,308
because you have no one else to talk to,

220
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,016
and you want to be understood.

221
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,843
Then you compel me to forget everything

222
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,813
as soon as I leave your presence

223
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,202
because you're too scared to trust.

224
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,080
I am scared of nothing.

225
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,651
What is this?

226
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:09,873
It's an ancient, mystical
plot I'm using to destroy you.

227
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,789
Relax. It's a tattoo design.

228
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,354
Draw on your own time.

229
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,199
This is my time.

230
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,220
You steal it from me.

231
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,417
Where do you want him?

232
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,257
Rebekah: Well, just put him anywhere handy

233
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,059
until Klaus is taken care of.

234
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,175
Where are we gonna put Klaus?

235
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,585
He needs to be away from all the others.

236
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,775
We don't want him fomenting descent.

237
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,502
You know he has a knack with words.

238
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,653
He could talk his way out of hell.

239
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:46,887
Yeah. I got a spot picked
out for him in the back.

240
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,657
Only person he's gonna be talking to

241
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,597
for the next 52 years is himself.

242
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,097
52?

243
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:55,408
One for each year that he
kept you daggered in the 1800s.

244
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,986
You mean, you let him keep me daggered.

245
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,564
And I'll spend every year Klaus is in here

246
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,654
apologizing to you for it.

247
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,343
Well, I'll settle for long enough

248
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,045
to experience just

249
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,784
a little bit of happiness

250
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,723
and ensure that my niece isn't turned

251
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,032
into a hybrid breeding machine.

252
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,610
It's gonna be tough to keep him in here.

253
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:16,830
That little witch of yours

254
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,500
would put the odds in our favor.

255
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,764
I can't risk it.

256
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,172
She's got less and less control

257
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:22,636
over her magic lately.

258
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,526
I can't even get her
out of the church attic,

259
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:27,122
much less rely on her to
go to battle against Klaus.

260
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,074
Then we'll need your very best warriors.

261
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,989
Klaus is strong and crafty,

262
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,323
and betrayal makes him particularly nasty.

263
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,910
What we're doing is

264
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,923
nothing Klaus hasn't done
to both you and your brother

265
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,657
a dozen times over.

266
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,572
You're not getting second
thoughts now, are you?

267
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:48,287
No. These aren't second thoughts.

268
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:51,715
They're feelings of regret.

269
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,544
I should've buried him a hundred years ago.

270
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,189
It's a hundred years we
could've been together.

271
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,129
Uh!

272
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,617
It's ok. It's ok.

273
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,923
Oh, Celeste.

274
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,295
Hayley, I'm sorry.

275
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:47,997
I thought you were someone else.

276
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,836
- Celeste?
- Yes.

277
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:53,108
Whoever she was, she was smoking hot.

278
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,804
How... 

279
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:58,333
Did I let you enter my thoughts?

280
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,762
I'm not well. I should go.

281
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,220
[Coughs]

282
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,654
- This is... 
- This is fine.

283
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:09,589
Elijah, you're sick.
I'm taking care of you.

284
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:14,998
We're being watched.

285
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,499
Hey!

286
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,008
Hey!

287
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,497
Oh, man, I'll never get used to that.

288
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,843
Why do I get the feeling
you studied theater?

289
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:58,462
All the world's a stage, young Joshua,

290
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:01,436
and it just so happens I have
the role of a lifetime for you.

291
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:11,911
What do you got, Josh?

292
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,575
What do I got?

293
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:15,821
Klaus wants me to steal some

294
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,806
dagger from you. It's a test, ok?

295
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:20,408
He knows I'm working
for you. I'm sure of it.

296
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,147
That bastard wants to dagger us again.

297
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,971
He deserves everything he's gonna get.

298
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,713
Relax.

299
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,234
If he knew, he would've
ripped out your spine

300
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:28,679
through your nose by now.

301
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,112
Oh, great.

302
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,864
Now I feel totally at ease.

303
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,766
- What am I supposed to do?
- You tell him

304
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:36,380
you searched high and low but
you couldn't find the dagger.

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,482
Oh, God, I'm so dead.

306
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,821
Then you tell him you saw I had it on me,

307
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,099
that if he wants it, he'll
have to come and get it,

308
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,376
which won't be easy because I'm paranoid

309
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,009
and I beefed up my posse.

310
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:47,599
Josh: All right.

311
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,895
So, not doubting your mad vampire skills

312
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,183
of destruction or anything,

313
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,866
but Marcel is on red alert,

314
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:55,501
surrounded by, like, an army.

315
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:56,820
You're totally boned,

316
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,403
- unless... 
- Unless what?

317
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:01,937
I overheard him arguing with Diego.

318
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:03,709
Apparently, he's clearing out

319
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,704
the compound tonight
for a date or something.

320
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:08,126
That's where Marcel will be.

321
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,165
When I run New Orleans,

322
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:13,394
there will be a permanent daylight
ring in it for you, Joshua,

323
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,390
for services rendered
unto your true king... 

324
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,380
Cool.

325
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:21,502
But... 

326
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:25,018
if you ever betray me,

327
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:29,567
I will make sure you spend
the rest of your eternal life

328
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,394
in exquisite agony

329
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,959
wishing for a merciful death.

330
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,428
Adios, Klaus.

331
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,199
What do you want?

332
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:05,483
It's poitin.

333
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,580
It'd raise the dead,

334
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,382
kill them, and raise them again.

335
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:19,826
I'd like to talk to you
about your niece Camille.

336
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,741
I'm sure you suspect this already

337
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,517
by the gaps in her memory.

338
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,688
I compel her.

339
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,849
At first, it was because
she was a useful spy

340
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,045
but now for her own protection.

341
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,986
I assumed a vampire was
messing with her mind,

342
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,288
though I never anticipated a confession.

343
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,352
She won't leave things be.

344
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,579
Her mind churns with the permutations

345
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:42,836
of what happened in this church

346
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,657
when her twin when on his slaughter spree.

347
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:47,166
Now, if she finds out what really happened,

348
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,743
that the vampires and witch hexes

349
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,976
were involved, she will dig

350
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,604
and dig and dig until she digs too deep

351
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:55,581
and gets herself killed.

352
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,116
New Orleans will be the death of her.

353
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,150
She needs to leave,

354
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,304
and, as ironic as it may seem,

355
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,287
I believe it should be her choice.

356
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,845
Yes.

357
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,016
It is ironic discussing free will

358
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,818
with a mind-controlling vampire.

359
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,017
She's a clever girl.

360
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,839
She gave me a piece of
her mind earlier today.

361
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,667
I would've killed others for less.

362
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,964

some kind is in order.

00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:30,871
I think... 

551
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:34,474
I think I'm losing it like he did.

552
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,026
I found this in my pocket.

553
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,939
The lines,

554
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,035
it's a secret code Sean and I

555
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:45,725
used to use when we were kids.

556
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,809
I have no memory of drawing it.

557
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:50,805
Something is not right.

558
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,638
I just can't figure it out.

559
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,964
Come here.

560
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,629
Oh... 

561
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:02,450
Maybe you should

562
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,615
leave town for a while... 

563
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,395
Give your head some space.

564
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:11,871
I know your Dean.

565
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,868
You could put your thesis on hold.

566
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,232
I can't.

567
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,360
This means something.

568
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,074
I just don't know what.

569
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:21,971
Not everything has meaning.

570
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,209
Sometimes you just have to let go.

571
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,489
You should leave New Orleans.

572
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:29,998
This town isn't for everybody.

573
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,424
Please.

574
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,851
Woman: I'm sure you got questions.

575
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:40,848
Only a thousand of them,

576
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:42,061
like who are you,

577
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,737
why are you following me,

578
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,358
where the hell is everyone,

579
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,250
and if the people in this book

580
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,218
really are my family,
what happened to them?

581
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,085
I'm Eve.

582
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:52,677
I'm following you because you brought

583
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:54,329
an Original to werewolf country,

584
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:56,356
which is pretty much the same reason

585
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,051
why everybody else skedaddled,

586
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,246
and if you want to know what happened

587
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,223
to the people in that family tree,

588
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,726
summing it up nice and quick,

589
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,659
Marcel happened.

590
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,325
What did he do?

591
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:09,369
He killed most of them.

592
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,190
Later, the

593
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,786
descendents of the ones who dodged death,

594
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:17,576
he strong-armed a witch
into putting a curse on them.

595
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,442
What kind of curse?

596
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,608
Swap nature around, inside out,

597
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:26,237
made it so their natural state was wolves.

598
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:28,922
They only turn back human on the full moon.

599
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,313
We get hunted by the marks we carry,

600
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,072
that Crescent moon birthmark.

601
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,743
That's why I got rid of mine.

602
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,014
I didn't want to get found out.

603
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:40,647
Elijah: Good evening.

604
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,128
Think... 

605
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:49,418
I might have something
which belongs to you.

606
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:51,364
Elijah, I've got this.

607
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,667
Are you ok?

608
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,757
The wound had healed, the fever has broken,

609
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:58,754
but for some strange reason,

610
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:03,484
I have this sharpened
lingering sensation in my back.

611
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,893
I have to get him home,

612
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,695
but I'll be back, ok?

613
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,628
I need to know more.

614
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,424
Keep that mark covered up.

615
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,271
What happened?

616
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,209
I just met part of my family.

617
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,788
Looking at what you've wrought?

618
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:11,821
Look. If you're gonna kill me,

619
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,367
let's get this over with.

620
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,026
Why would I kill you?

621
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,266
You picked up the coin.

622
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:19,782
There are rules of
engagement in battle, Marcel.

623
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,828
Without them, you'd have anarchy.

624
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:24,769
I would, however, like to talk

625
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:26,709
about accommodations,

626
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:29,943
your living quarters, for example.

627
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:32,545
I believe they used to be mine.

628
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,375
You want all this? Fine. It's yours.

629
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:37,942
You can put me back on
the street for all I care,

630
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,129
but let's make one thing clear.

631
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,626
You'll never have this... 

632
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:46,698
Loyalty.

633
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,432
You can't buy it. You can't own it.

634
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,790
You can't force it.

635
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:53,261
It comes only out of love and respect

636
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,345
for the people who believe in you.

637
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,863
You taught me many
things, Niklaus Mikaelson,

638
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:02,897
but this I learned myself,

639
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,863
and it is something
that you will never know.

640
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,264
Enjoy your kingdom.

641
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:50,039
So thanks for the ride.

642
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:53,556
Quite the awkward, little
adventure, wouldn't you say?

643
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:55,865
I'm sorry I tried to hurt you.

644
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,554
I would never want that.

645
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:00,381
Elij... 

646
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,577
Tell me what happened to Celeste.

647
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,608
- That's not important.
- It is important.

648
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,281
1,000 years of memories,

649
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,053
and that's what breaks
through your fever brain?

650
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,187
I want to know.

651
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,314
Show me.

652
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:34,119
[Panting]

653
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,294
Aah!

654
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,673
It was a cruel and bloody time

655
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:05,838
to be a witch,

656
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:08,654
courtesy of my wonderful brother.

657
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:12,666
- She died because of Klaus?
- She died because of me,

658
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,664
because I cared too deeply for her.

659
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:19,254
I had allowed my brother

660
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,856
to slip through my grasp.

661
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:22,263
I'd loosened the reins while Celeste

662
00:36:22,288 --> 00:36:24,071
consumed my every moment.

663
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:27,105
I'd abandoned him in the
name of my own happiness.

664
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,602
Celeste paid the price.

665
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:31,815
I don't get it.

666
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,544
Why are we here?

667
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:38,679
Why are you trying to
put together your family

668
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:41,491
when it's so clear that
one part of it is broken?

669
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,727
To me, the very definition
of the word "broken"

670
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:46,386
suggests that something can be fixed.

671
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:47,856
I have all eternity

672
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,953
to accomplish one single
task... my brother's salvation.

673
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,486
If I surrender this, then, tell me,

674
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,038
what value would I be to my family,

675
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,628
to myself, to... 

676
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:00,852
to your child?

677
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,597
Please, no, Hayley.

678
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,749
You've seen what happens.

679
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:34,997
[Footsteps]

680
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:49,621
Elijah is home. There's only one dagger.

681
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:52,103
Which one of us will
you be punishing today?

682
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,117
I contemplated a game

683
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:57,279
of eeny meeny miny... 

684
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,823
moe.

685
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,651
You betrayed me,

686
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:02,779
my own sister.

687
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:04,324
Niklaus, don't you dare.

688
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:07,055
Well, perhaps it should be you, brother,

689
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:09,773
stealing my child away
with every fawning moment

690
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,557
of tenderness you show to Hayley.

691
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,991
This has nothing to do with Hayley.

692
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,955
It has everything to do with her!

693
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,877
She's adored you since she arrived,

694
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:24,162
and now my child, my blood,

695
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:26,565
will grow up to call you father.

696
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,405
Is that what this is?

697
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,832
You are once again

698
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,872
worried that you will be left behind?

699
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,300
Has history taught you nothing?

700
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:37,065
We don't abandon you, Nik.

701
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:38,804
You drive us away.

702
00:38:40,963 --> 00:38:42,764
Is that so?

703
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,088
What have I done lately

704
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,952
other than cooperate?

705
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:51,661
I bowed down to you, brother,

706
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,788
to make up for daggering you

707
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:55,208
for the greater good of our plan

708
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,741
to reclaim our home;

709
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,680
looked the other way, sister,

710
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:01,615
while you repeat the
same cycle with Marcel,

711
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:04,167
falling again for a man
you shouldn't be with

712
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,945
while he controls the empire that we built

713
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:08,798
that he took.

714
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,259
Now, I make no excuses

715
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,380
for past sins,

716
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,145
but in the one moment
when you two could have

717
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:21,842
chosen to stand by me,

718
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,263
to believe in me

719
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:28,910
and believe my intentions
for my own child were pure,

720
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:32,638
you chose to stand against me,

721
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:35,074
to side with my enemies.

722
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,055
I wanted our home back.

723
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,940
Now I have it.

724
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:48,330
So I'm going to live there,

725
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,127
and the two of you,

726
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:54,905
you can stay here together

727
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:57,840
and rot.

728
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,421
You're coming with me, little wolf.

729
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,549
Why would I go anywhere with you?

730
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:29,524
Because, Hayley, that child you carry

731
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:31,971
is the only thing on this
earth that matters to me.

732
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:35,206
Now, you can fight me on
this, but you will lose,

733
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,886
as will anyone else who tries

734
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,778
to stop you getting in this car.

735
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:05,400
I figured it out,

736
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:06,981
the note.

737
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:09,496
I was thinking about it... my lost time,

738
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,966
my foggy brain.

739
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,193
I thought I must be going crazy like Sean,

740
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,477
but then I thought,

741
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:17,379
"what if somewhere in my subconscious,

742
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:20,275
I was trying to send myself a message?"

743
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:24,354
I was.

744
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:34,918
I found this in the "Picayune"
newspaper archives from 1919.

745
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,880
Look at this photo.

746
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:48,519
Cami: Those men, I know them.

747
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,348
I know both of them.
