1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,061
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:08,061
That was 10 blocks from here, and any
women won't walking alone at night.

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,700
I would never do that.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,451
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,862
This is a safe street. This is
a safe building. There's nothing

6
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:18,906
Oh, my God! What are
you doing in here?!

7
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:20,753
Mom, I gotta go! IT gotta go!

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,858
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,175
That's fine, you just read the paper.

10
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,723
I'm gonna get a pot.

11
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,913
It's not for you.

12
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,286
Okay, that's fine.

13
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,096
Read the Family Circus...

14
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,465
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

15
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,801
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God...

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,907
It's open, you guys.

17
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,220
Can I help you?

18
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,461
Does Phoebe still live here?

19
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:12,929
No, she doesn't. But I can get
a message to her.

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,946
Great. Just tell her
her husband stopped by.

21
00:01:16,038 --> 00:01:17,471
Her what?

22
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,251
How did you do that?

23
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:28,085
The One With Phoebe's Husband

24
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:13,325
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

25
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,231
I'm not "married"
married, you know?

26
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,030
He's just a friend, and he's gay...

27
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:19,816
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

28
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,947
I can't believe you married Duncan!

29
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:25,751
How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.

30
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get judgmental...

31
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:30,432
...and wouldn't approve.

32
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,547
Of course I wouldn't approve!

33
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:35,774
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

34
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,628
What the hell were you thinking?

35
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,572
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

36
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,908
I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.

37
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:48,326
When he left town, you
stayed in your pajamas for a month.

38
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,333
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

39
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:54,838
Well, didn't you?

40
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,339
I might have.

41
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,432
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

42
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,987
Like you tell me everything?

43
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:04,113
What have I not told you?

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,865
I don't know.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,958
The fact that the underwear out
on the telephone pole is yours...

46
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,590
...from when you had sex
with Bobby on the terrace!

47
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,834
What?

48
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:15,857
Wait a minute! Who told you?

49
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:21,818
You are dead meat.

50
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,591
I didn't know it was a big secret.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,798
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

52
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,365
IKind of the same as, say...

53
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,980
...I don't know, having
a third nipple!

54
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,093
You have a third nipple?

55
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,822
You bitch!

56
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,424
Whip it out! Whip it out!

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,788
There's nothing to see! It's a
tiny bump. It's totally useless.

58
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,095
As opposed to your other
multi-functional nipples?

59
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:55,479
I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.

60
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,998
Joey, what did you think
a nubbin was?

61
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,775
You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.

62
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,183
- Let me see it again!
- Yes, show us your nubbin!

63
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:09,923
Joey was in a porno movie!

64
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,309
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me!

65
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:18,656
- Oh, my God!
- You were in a porno?!

66
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,678
I was young and I just wanted a job.

67
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,869
But I couldn't go through with it.

68
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,100
They let me be the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,852
...because there's people
having sex on it.

70
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,454
That is wild!

71
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,830
- What's it shaped like?
- Is it hairy?

72
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,931
What happens if you flick it?

73
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:48,538
So does it do anything,
you know, special?

74
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,982
Pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

75
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,264
...to the magical land of Narnia.

76
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:59,813
In some cultures, having a third nipple
is actually a sign of virility.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,529
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

78
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,030
Are any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

79
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:12,024
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

80
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:17,149
Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!

81
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,494
I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

82
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:28,019
But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.

83
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,811
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

84
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:34,439
I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,435
- Sassy lady!
- Where are you going?

86
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,981
I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

87
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,995
He's in the Capades.

88
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:54,142
- The Ice Capades?
- No, the Gravel Capades.

89
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,629
The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

90
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,786
I can't believe
you'd dress up for him.

91
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,203
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

92
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,079
Okay, no.

93
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:11,498
For your information, I'm seeing him
so I can put those feelings behind me.

94
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:15,332
The reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

95
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,862
...to look nice for your gay husband.

96
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,795
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

97
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,077
Chandler, will you fill me up here?

98
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,466
I see, I see. Because of
the third-nipple thing.

99
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:43,476
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

100
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,691
- See you later, Rach.
- Bye-bye, Julie.

101
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,652
Come on, cut it out!

102
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,873
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,777
What?

104
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,768
Come on, talk to me.

105
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:17,654
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

106
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:21,632
...having the sex?

107
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,249
Why? Who's not?
Are you and Julie not?

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,328
Are you and Julie not having sex?

109
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,212
Technically?

110
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:32,685
No.

111
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,862
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

112
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,842
Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

113
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,621
No! She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

114
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:51,990
We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like

115
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,714
No! Don't need to know the details.

116
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,844
No, it's just...

117
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,755
It's me.

118
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,882
I've only been with
one woman my whole life...

119
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:06,055
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

120
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,868
So now I've got myself
all psyched out.

121
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,434
It's become, like, this...

122
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,120
...this thing!

123
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,642
You must just think I'm weird.

124
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,599
No, I don't think it's weird.

125
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:25,127
I think, in fact...

126
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:27,702
- In fact, you know what I think?
- What?

127
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,051
I think it's sexy.

128
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:32,402
Sexy?

129
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,677
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

130
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,880
...there is nothing sexier...

131
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,496
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

132
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:43,418
No kidding?

133
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:44,993
You know what I'd do?

134
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,550
I'd wait.

135
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,209
- You'd wait?
- Absolutely. I would wait...

136
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,387
...and wait...

137
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,914
Then I'd wait some more.

138
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,193
Really?

139
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:03,436
I don't care if she tells you
she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

140
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:07,210
...she tells you she's gonna
have sex with another man

141
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,855
That just means it's working.

142
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,304
Women really want this?

143
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,185
More than jewelry.

144
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,006
Look at you! You look great!

145
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,352
Do I? Thank you.

146
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,307
So do you. Sparkly!

147
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,592
This is pretty wonderful,
Mr. Major Capades Guy!

148
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:59,300
I remember when you were just
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

149
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,316
You always said I'd make it.

150
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,399
Well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way.

151
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,471
Gosh, I missed you!

152
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,853
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Okay.

153
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:17,559
Now.

154
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,247
Oh! Right. Okay.

155
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:23,756
Ole!

156
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,325
What?

157
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:28,210
The Matador...

158
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,318
Ole!

159
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,628
Sweetie, can you
hold this for a second?

160
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:53,281
Sorry, you had a
paleontologist on your face.

161
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,077
But it's gone now.
You're all right.

162
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,798
Hi, everyone.

163
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,894
I wanted to thank you
for our little talk before.

164
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:07,405
No problem! So you're gonna
go with the waiting thing?

165
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,932
I was going to, but after
I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

166
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,222
Good. What did he say?

167
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:20,024
He told me to get over myself
and just do it.

168
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:23,606
I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

169
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:26,927
And his way, I get
to have sex tonight, so...

170
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,652
What is this in my pocket?

171
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:39,342
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

172
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:42,918
Pop it in!

173
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,101
I'm fine, if you're
okay watching a video...

174
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,483
...filled with two-nippled people.

175
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:54,457
People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

176
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,682
What's wrong with people having sex?

177
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,856
Well, you know, these
movies are offensive...

178
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:08,277
...and degrading
to women and females...

179
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:13,257
And the lighting's
always unflattering.

180
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,964
- Monica, help me out here.
- Hell, I wanna see Joey!

181
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:29,442
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right

182
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:31,354
Oh. Never mind.

183
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:35,152
Wait a minute. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

184
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,044
All I say is, she'd
better get the job.

185
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,194
Looks to me like he's
the one getting the job.

186
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,551
Here I come.

187
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:47,444
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

188
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:51,351
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

189
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,272
So I just watch them have sex.

190
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,939
Then I say Here's my line!

191
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,658
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

192
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,400
Nice work, my friend!

193
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,424
Wait, you see me again. Hang on,
the guy's butt's blocking me.

194
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:15,179
There I am. There I am.
There I am...

195
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,987
So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

196
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,701
I kind of need a divorce.

197
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,153
O...

198
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,746
...kay.

199
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:37,203
How come?

200
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:41,066
Actually, I'm getting married again.

201
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,395
What?

202
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,539
I don't know how to tell you this.

203
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,295
I'm straight.

204
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:55,481
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

205
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,952
You're so smart and funny...

206
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,935
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties!

207
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:03,325
That's what I kept telling myself.

208
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,909
But you reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

209
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:10,219
How long have you known?

210
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:15,182
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

211
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,005
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

212
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:22,871
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends
are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

213
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:28,474
And there's actually a woman?

214
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,331
Her name's Debra.

215
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,696
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,220
I've never told you this...

217
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:45,506
...but there were one
or two times back in college when...

218
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,529
...I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

219
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,224
...and wake up with
a woman next to me.

220
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,256
I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

221
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:57,481
Sure.

222
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:01,457
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!

223
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,902
I don't know what to say.

224
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:10,776
You're married to someone for
six years and you think you know him.

225
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,693
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay!"

226
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,881
I'm still me.

227
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:26,252
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

228
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:31,174
You know, it still
smells like monkey in there.

229
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,543
That saves us the conversation.

230
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,962
This has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

231
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,230
Me too. We should get going.

232
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,956
No! Come on, you guys!

233
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:48,467
Come on, it's only 11:30.

234
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:52,686
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

235
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,295
Rachel, that's all we do.

236
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,432
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

237
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:02,146
What about Julie?

238
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:06,331
You have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

239
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,629
...and we don't really know you.

240
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,267
I mean, who is Julie?

241
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,723
What do you like?
What don't you like?

242
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,052
We want to know everything.

243
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,206
Well, that could take awhile.

244
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,819
So?

245
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,735
Who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

246
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:27,200
I got the time to get to know Julie.

247
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,282
I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

248
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:35,223
That's fine.

249
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:39,058
Let's start with your childhood.
What was that like?

250
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,133
In a nutshell

251
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:48,111
So, have you told your parents?

252
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,474
No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.

253
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,892
My brother's straight, so...

254
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,646
Here you go.

255
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:59,368
You know what?
I just have one more question.

256
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:04,609
If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

257
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,331
...do you think I
would have been the one...?

258
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,155
No. Don't tell me.

259
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,298
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

260
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,152
I love you, Phoebe.

261
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,141
So your brother's straight, huh?

262
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,619
Seriously.

263
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:43,352
And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

264
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,947
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

265
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,166
Mrs. Gobb?

266
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:50,945
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

267
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,946
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

268
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,480
I'm going home.

269
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,673
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,874
Good night.

271
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:14,319
It's pretty late. You're
probably not still planning on...

272
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:16,603
No, I am.

273
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,954
Are you nervous?

274
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:24,037
I have done it before.

275
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,686
I mean, how are
you gonna handle it?

276
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:31,832
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

277
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,122
I don't know. I guess
I'm just gonna...

278
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,958
...see what happens.

279
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,932
Good luck!

280
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,201
What?

281
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,028
Nothing...

282
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:51,989
It is your first time with her, and
if the first time doesn't go well...

283
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:55,907
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

284
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:59,776
Okay, now I'm nervous.

285
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,691
Maybe you should put it off.

286
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,594
No, I don't want to put it off!

287
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,956
I spent last year being
so unbelievably miserable.

288
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,931
And now I'm actually happy.

289
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,645
You know, I mean really happy.

290
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:22,824
I just don't wanna...

291
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:26,021
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

292
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,130
I know.

293
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:33,507
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,698
It's not your fault.

295
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,072
Right.

296
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,733
Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

297
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:47,192
Maybe you were on the right track
with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

298
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:50,375
- Women really like that.
- Really?

299
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,342
I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to...

300
00:19:56,764 --> 00:20:00,530
I don't know, catch me off guard
with a really...

301
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,356
...good kiss.

302
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:08,840
Really sort of soft at first.

303
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:14,711
And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

304
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:19,022
And then look far into my eyes...

305
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,722
...in a way that lets me
know something...

306
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:25,048
...amazing is about to happen.

307
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:33,186
And then, I don't know, then...

308
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,255
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

309
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:39,801
...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

310
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,163
And it would get kind of...

311
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:47,317
...sweaty...

312
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:50,909
...and blurry.

313
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:55,941
And then it's just happening.

314
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,381
Thanks, Rach. Good night!

315
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,170
Oh, God!

316
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,132
Good morning!

317
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:30,118
Well, somebody got some last night!

318
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,086
Twice!
