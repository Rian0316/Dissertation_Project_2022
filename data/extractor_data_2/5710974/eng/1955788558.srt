1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,720
- Captain Daly.
- Report.

2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,120
A non-federation vessel jumped straight
out of white space right in front of us.

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,800
-Valdack.
-That can't be.

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,360
My data scan indicates
a heavily armored Gorgan Dreadnought,

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,040
vessel ID number 9864321.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,360
Thank you, Dudani. Valdack must have
hijacked it from the Fermi hub

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,840
and tracked our position.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,040
-Tulaska, shield status?
-Shields 100%.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,320
-Helmsman Packer?
-Captain.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
-Prime rear thrusters.
-Rear thrusters primed.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,680
If that's Valdack, he'll rip us to shreds.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,640
Captain, we have to surrender.
There's no other way.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,760
Let's not lose our heads,
Lieutenant Walton.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
Shields at 68%.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,560
Heavy damage reported,
decks six through ten.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
Fires in med center
and major rupture to cargo bay Alpha.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,240
We've got no choice!

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,720
Do you want me to open comms
with Valdack's craft, Captain?

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,320
Negative.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,800
-Shields at 54%.
-There's no way out.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
- Captain, please.
- Not now, Walton.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,000
Helmsman Packer,
take us into that asteroid gas cluster.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,440
-Into the cluster?
-That's suicide, sir.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
It is our only chance.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,040
That gas cluster is charged
with ionized pyron particles.

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,480
If our shields hold, we can use them
to increase our photon intensity.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,320
Packer, increase thrusters.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,240
Shields at 43%.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,040
It'll tear the ship apart, Captain!

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,720
Walton, you are a Space Fleet officer.
Act accordingly.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,960
-Shields at 32%.
-Valdack's not following.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,520
Packer, turn us around.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,120
- Tulaska, charge photon bolts.
- Bolts charged, Captain.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Fire!

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
His hull's breached, shields gone.
He's defenseless.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,280
-Lieutenant Lowry, open comms.
-He's already hailing us, Captain.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
On screen.

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,720
Captain Daly, may you drown
in the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes!

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You are defeated, Valdack.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,960
Return the plasmorthian crystal
and we'll cause you no more damage.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,600
You must think me a fool, Captain!

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,160
I know the crystal's capabilities,
and I will die before I give it up!

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,000
I gave you a chance, Valdack,
showed you mercy.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
Reflect on that while you can.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Close comms.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,240
-Tulaska, destroy his ship.
-Yes, Captain.

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
-That was incredible, Captain.
-You saved our lives.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm so sorry
I lost it back there, Captain.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,720
Not for the first time, Walton.

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
And I should know by now
never to doubt you.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Please forgive me.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,960
At ease, Walton.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Captain, sensors indicate
an escape pod ejected

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
from Valdack's ship before detonation.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
He's escaping with the crystal.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
You want me to plot
a pursuit course, Captain?

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
No.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,720
We'll let him go... for now.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,400
-Great decision-making, Captain.
-Three cheers for Captain Daly.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,840
♪  For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

64
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,440

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,640
God bless you, Captain. God bless you.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Thirteenth floor.

68
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
-Welcome to Callister.
-Oh.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,240
Excuse me.

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Excuse me.

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,079
Hey.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
Uh... Elena, my pass doesn't work.

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
You must renew on first of each month.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, I know that,
but the first was on the weekend, so...

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,400
OK.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Thank you.

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,520
You're welcome.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,440
Prepare to enter

79
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,480
the most immersive gaming experience
in years,

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Infinity,  from Callister Inc.

81
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,200
-Morning, Mr. Daly.
-Helmsman Packer.

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Huh?

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,200
Uh, I mean, Mr. Packer. Nate.

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,400
OK.

85
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
Are you making coffees?

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Yeah.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,840
Do you think maybe
you could make me one too?

88
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Sure, sure. Uh, what do you want?

89
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,720
Just vanilla latte. Skim milk.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Yeah, good call. 'Cause...

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
...those are very, very big numbers.

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,920
We might just have to hold you to that.
Well, no, yes, of course.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
Sure. Yes.

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Oh, are you OK, man?

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
I guess you didn't see my gym bag.

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Here. Come on.

97
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
- I'm sorry, bud.
- OK.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
You left it...

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,480
You're gonna do it for me
and make it good.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
You know you are a god to me at least.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh. The ladies' bathroom is that way.
The sign's kind of confusing.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,200
You're Robert Daly, right?

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
-Right.
-Yeah, hi.

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm Nanette, Nanette Cole.

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Um...

106
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
I started here today,
coding on the update,

107
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,600
and I just wanted to, uh,
pass on my admiration

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,000
to the person
who actually designed  Infinity.

109
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,520
The procedural algorithm is amazing.

110
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,160
It's just some beautiful code.

111
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
Thank you.

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,920
That's actually the reason
that I wanted to work here.

113
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,760
-You must be busy. I'm so sorry.
-No, no, it's fine.

114
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
- Sorry.
- No.

115
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
Well, just fangirling. Sorry. Um...

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
Ooh... vintage.

117
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,840
-Yeah, it's  Space Fleet.
-Wow.

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,520
It's a TV show. Before your time.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
Before my time, actually.

120
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,720
But it was... visionary.

121
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,480
Is this on, like, tape?

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,040
Yeah, I've got the VHS, the DVD, Blu-ray.

123
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,080
The whole thing. Seasons one to six.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Netflix has it these days, but...

125
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,840
Aboard the spaceship  USS Callister.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,440
-OK, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,160
So-- OK, so Callister is like the, uh--

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,360
Yeah, when we set up the company, um...

129
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,920
I suggested we call it Callister
as kind of a little tribute.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Walton didn't really get the reference,
but he let me have that one.

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Mini-skirted damsels.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
A little cold for that in space.

133
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,360
That is just what a Bargradian
sand warrior would say.

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,760
Bob, Christmas is closing in
like a goddamn meteor.

135
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,600
We've got customers all over our balls
waiting for the  Infinity  update.

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Tell me it's gonna be up and running
before the weekend.

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,920
-Oh, I'll ask Kabir--
-You're CTO. Don't ask anybody anything.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,720
You should be telling people things
like I'm telling you right now.

139
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,520
-I'll talk to him.
-Good.

140
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,920
-I'm sorry.
-OK.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,520
Sorry, I couldn't find a good moment to...

143
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,480
Oh, you must be new.
Uh... I'm James Walton. I run the company.

144
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,280
- I--
- Well, we run the company, kind of.

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,560
Bob here is the hardware,
and I am the shiny front end.

146
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
- I'm Nanette Cole.
- Which department?

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,440
-Engine architecture.
-And it's your first day?

148
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Uh...

149
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
- Yeah.
- Have you had the tour?

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,400
No, I...

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Please, allow me.

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,880
OK.

153
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,080
It was so nice to meet you.

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
Just a little bit.

155
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a different environment
I set up here.

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,880
People call it a carefree environment.
I call it "care-full."

157
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,800
- Interesting.
- Not scary.

158
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,960
Dudani?

159
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,080
Kabir?

160
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
Mm. Mr. Daly.

161
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
Do you have the latest ETA
on the update patch?

162
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,160
It's just there's still
some runtime errors.

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Well, the thing is, we could have it ready
by end of play today,

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
but if we had time,
we could alter the trading mechanics,

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,600
tweak the critical hit system,
but of course, that'd add another week,

166
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
maybe ten days or so.

167
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Mr. Daly?

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,960
-Yeah. Yeah, do all of that, thank you.
-I'll... OK, we're on it.

169
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,280
Welcome back, Captain.

170
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,400
Have you located Valdack's position?

171
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,920
Not yet, but our sensors
are scanning every star system

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
between here and Valatros.

173
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
So your answer is no?

174
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Uh...

175
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm afraid so, sir.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,760
You... are pathetic, Walton. What are you?

177
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
What's that?

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Pathetic.

179
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,480
So Valdack's out there somewhere

180
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,640
and you village idiots
are asleep at the wheel.

181
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,840
You're not just disgraceful,
you're disgusting, all of you.

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,240
So can you do one thing?

183
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Can you find Valdack?

184
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm not asking. I'm telling you!
Understand?

185
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
-Hmm?
-Yes.

186
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,640
- Yes?
- Yes, Captain. Yeah.

187
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,840
- Yes.
- Aye, Captain.

188
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,600
Huh?

189
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,080
Well, all right.

190
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
Tulaska, check security protocols.
If they've expired, you're in trouble.

191
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,280
Yes, Captain.

192
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,800
Dudani, recheck those probe results.

193
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,200
-No room for errors.
-Of course, Captain.

194
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,040
-Helmsman Packer?
-Captain.

195
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,680
Vanilla latte.

196
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,040
-Skim milk.
-At once.

197
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
Walton.

198
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Exit game.

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,920
Hi, Nanette. You feel like
you have everything you need here?

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Mm-hmm.

201
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
-All right. That's a nice sweater.
-Oh. Thank you.

202
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
Cashmere?

203
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,160
Mr. Daly, got that new ETA
on the update patch.

204
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,840
-New ETA?
-Yeah, it's all good.

205
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
But now we're looking
at December 24th for rollout.

206
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
We don't patch until Christmas Eve?

207
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,560
Well, yeah, I mean,
with the alterations you approved.

208
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,800
OK, OK. Thank you.

209
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
OK.

210
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,480
-Hi, Robert.
-Hi.

211
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,480
Um, I was just gonna fix a coffee.
Do you want one?

212
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
-Sure.
-OK.

213
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,280
Um... vanilla latte with skim milk.

214
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
- Okey-dokes.
- OK.

215
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,040
Absolutely.

216
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,640
Mm-hmm.

217
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,960
Well, yes, they are great numbers.

218
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
OK. Mm-hmm.

219
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Ta-ta.

220
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
Total fucking shitwit.

221
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,160
-Do you want coffee?
-Um, Brushed Suede. Thank you.

222
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,560
So how are you settling in?
Are you settling in?

223
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,040
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone here is really friendly.

224
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,960
And um...
it is not like my last job, thank God.

225
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,320
-Yeah?
-It was a toxic workplace, you know.

226
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,720
My boss was a major-league bully and...

227
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,480
-It's not like here, like with Mr...
-Walton.

228
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,680
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. He's a really good guy.

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,400
He's a bit of a player.

230
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Chuck a sandwich across the room,
he'll fuck it before it hits the ground,

231
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,960
but he's basically an all right bloke.

232
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,960
OK. Well, there's uh...
two bosses here anyway, so I guess--

233
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,720
-Two how?
-Robert Daly.

234
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
Oh!

235
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,600
I mean, well, yeah, technically.

236
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,480
Mr. Daly is actually
the whole reason that I'm here.

237
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,440
- Really? Interesting.
- I mean...

238
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,120
Who wouldn't wanna work under
an incredible mind like that, you know?

239
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
His coding is... It's sublime.

240
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,880
Do you have a thing for him?

241
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,120
Daly? No, no. No. It's not like that.

242
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
It's purely...
It's professional.

243
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
I like his code.

244
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,680
Ah. Fucking hell,
I was gonna say, you know,

245
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,440
don't be too nice to him
'cause he gets a bit starey.

246
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Mm.

247
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,040
Wide berth, that's my advice. Wide berth.

248
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
-OK.
-Yeah.

249
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,520
Thank you.

250
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,960
-There you go.
-Thank you.

251
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,720
- Bye.
- No bye. I'm coming.

252
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,359
No. Suck a dick, Karl.

253
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,840
Later, guys.

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,600
Welcome to Callister.

255
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,160
Thank you.

256
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,720
You're welcome.

257
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,520
Goddamn it, Robert!

258
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,520
-Christmas Eve. Really?
-Uh...

259
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Not OK.

260
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Oh.

261
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,120
Hello?

262
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,960
Oh, boy. It looks like
there's a new girl in the office.

263
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,680
What's your name, hon?

264
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Come in. Let me fix you a drink.

265
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,160
We have everything
from Bengarian phlegm shots to uh...

266
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,240
ooh, distilled root blood
from the Cangor quadrant.

267
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,240
What's your poison? Some of this
actually is poison, so don't be shy.

268
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,240
Am I dreaming?

269
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,840
Yeah, no, no, 'fraid not.

270
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,280
- I remember dreaming.
- Me too.

271
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
But where am I?

272
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,440
This is the  USS Callister,
Space Fleet's finest,

273
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,960
exploring the furthest reaches
of the known universe and beyond.

274
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,080
We are its loyal space crew
and now, apparently, so are you. Cheers.

275
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,480
Your name? Babe, what's your name?

276
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,160
Nanette. We've met.

277
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,160
Maybe, in the real world.
I wouldn't have no way of knowing.

278
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,240
-What do you mean?
-You'd better sit down.

279
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,800
No, I don't... I don't wanna sit down.

280
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,440
I wanna know what's going on.

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,240
You're on board Robert Daly's ship.

282
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,280
Robert Daly, the CTO?

283
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,280
Here he's Captain Daly,
our fearless leader.

284
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Yeah, you're seriously
gonna need to sit the fuck down.

285
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,760
- Uh...
- Welcome.

286
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,400
You are um... Hey, hey.
You're the intern from work, right? Nate?

287
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,440
Packer. Nate Packer.

288
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,600
Wait. So I'm still
just the intern out there?

289
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,480
Jesus.

290
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
You're um... You're... You're...

291
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
Dudani. Diagnostics.

292
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,360
-Welcome.
-Right.

293
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
-You're the receptionist, right?
-Elena.

294
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,360
- Your skin is blue.
- Weird blue alien skin, I know.

295
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,120
It's fucked up.

296
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
Almost sort of racist.

297
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,840
OK. Walt, fix her something,
something she'll recognize. Vodka.

298
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,280
-Hey. So what's it like out there now?
-What?

299
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,320
- What year is it?
- Don't do her head in.

300
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,440
- What?
- What year? I... saw you today.

301
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,400
Ooh. Did you see me? Did I look thin? Hmm?

302
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
Like, wheatgrass yogurt thin?

303
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,040
Can we not pop her fucking mind?

304
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,960
Someone needs
to be straight with me right now.

305
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,360
OK. OK, listen.

306
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
This is  Infinity.

307
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,920
That's what we're all inside.
That's where all of this exists.

308
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,400
Infinity , the game?

309
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,520
Daly's got his own modded version
of  Infinity,

310
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
reskinned to look like
his favorite TV show.

311
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,640
-Space Thing? Space Thing?
-Space Fleet.

312
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
-Hence the groovy decor.
-And this tasteful get-up.

313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
Infinity.

314
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,360
That's an online game,
like a multiplayer deal. This...

315
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,960
This is his development build,
sealed off so he can control it.

316
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,600
He keeps it offline

317
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,080
so the custom code he's written
can't be detected and deleted.

318
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Mm. Yes, it's a bubble universe,
ruled by an asshole god.

319
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,640
He...

320
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
put us in... in here?

321
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,840
Mm-hmm.

322
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Drink your vodka.

323
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,520
-How do we get out?
-No, really, drink it.

324
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,400
Drink it.

325
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,680
- You can't leave.
- What?

326
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
None of us can.

327
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,440
- Because you're not actually you.
- What?

328
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,080
I know it's mental,
but you're a copy of you.

329
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,600
-A digital clone.
-No.

330
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,640
No, I am... I'm me. I am me.

331
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,360
- I'm me.
- No, not the real you.

332
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,800
Daly's created an identical
digital version of you, of all of us.

333
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,160
From your DNA.
He'll have harvested it somehow.

334
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,800
He told me he got mine
from the rim of a smoothie cup.

335
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,840
He retrieved Packer's juices
from the bathroom.

336
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,520
Man, you have got to let that go.
She does not need details.

337
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
Basically he's got a gizmo--

338
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,120
I theorize an advanced
biometric DNA virtual clone.

339
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,120
He's got a fucking gizmo.
That's what I said.

340
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,920
He fed your DNA in,
he put you inside his computer

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,280
and, bam, you pop up here like a Pop-Tart.

342
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah, we've all been through it.

343
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
He brings us in for different reasons,
shit we did in the office.

344
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
I called him out for staring.

345
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,720
I reset admin permissions
on a test build for 14 minutes.

346
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,440
Insufficient smiling.

347
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,640
-I brought him the wrong sandwich.
-OK, never mind the reasons.

348
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,320
The point is that we're stuck
in Daly's playground,

349
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,120
and that's all you need to know.

350
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,920
This is a dream. Yeah, it has to be.

351
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,480
It's more like an eternal waking nightmare
from which there is no escape.

352
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,160
- No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Oh, for fuck's sake,

353
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm trying to break her in gently.

354
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
The quicker she gets it,
the easier it'll be.

355
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
Daddy's home.

356
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,640
He'll be here any moment.

357
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
No. I'm gonna get out of here.

358
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You gotta stay on the bridge.

359
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
He controls everything.

360
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,120
-He does shit to make us cooperate.
-Get off.

361
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,040
- You have no idea. I'm trying to help.
- Just leave it.

362
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,040
He's gonna fuck us up
if she doesn't play ball.

363
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Yes, well, she's gonna have to work it out
for herself, like we all did.

364
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
There's gotta be a way out. Come on.

365
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,200
Lieutenant Cole, welcome aboard.

366
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,760
Crew, we have a new member of the team,
Science Officer Nanette Cole.

367
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
Please, take your post.

368
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,120
I believe we've finally managed
to track Valdack to an uncharted planet.

369
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,640
-No.
-Take your post. That is an order.

370
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm not doing this.

371
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,560
The whole thing's much better
if you let yourself get into it.

372
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,080
If you think that I'm playing along
with your  Space Force  bullshit...

373
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,920
- Space Fleet.
- Whatever.

374
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,720
-You can think again.
-This is my ship.

375
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,080
-I am your captain. An order is an order.
-Then go fuck yourself.

376
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
Sir.

377
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,560
OK. So we're doing it this way.

378
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,080
Are you gonna throw a fireball?

379
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,800
Oh, dear. You can't see.
You can't breathe.

380
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
Unpleasant, isn't it?

381
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,120
Do you submit?

382
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,000
You won't die, you know.

383
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,840
No one dies in here unless I want them to.

384
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,160
I can keep you like this forever
if I feel like it.

385
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,840
Forever gasping for breath
with a mouth that isn't there.

386
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,760
Do you submit?

387
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,680
Good girl.

388
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Lieutenant Cole, Valdack's hideout.
Triangulate the signal, please.

389
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,560
It's any button. They're all the same.

390
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Well?

391
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,080
I'm getting a signal
from a class five planet.

392
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,400
- Rannotch.
- Rannoch.

393
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,400
Rannoch B.

394
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,600
Excellent. Dudani,
prepare the transmat system.

395
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,520
-Of course, Captain.
-Walton, Packer, Lowry, with me.

396
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,920
We'll transport down to the planet,
reclaim the crystal

397
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,960
and bring Valdack to justice.

398
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,880
Actually, Cole, you come too.

399
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,600
Perfect opportunity for you to prove

400
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,920
you're more than a recommendation
from Space Fleet. What do you say?

401
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,160
-Mr. Dudani, transport.
-Aye aye, Captain.

402
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,120
Breathable atmosphere.

403
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,760
Scanning for plasmorthian traces.

404
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,160
Crystal's this way. Let's go.

405
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,320
-Nate. Hey, Nate.
-Helmsman Packer, OK?

406
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,440
Call me Helmsman Packer. He hates it
when we don't use our proper titles.

407
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,560
OK. You got a gun, so let's take him out.

408
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,320
-Then give it to me.
-OK, one, our guns don't even work.

409
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Only his does. And two, the motherfucker
is invincible, OK? Come on, let's go.

410
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
At least you've got a gun.

411
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,440
- Captain.
- Shh.

412
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,240
We meet again, Captain Daly!

413
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,680
We're trapped.

414
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,960
Not advisable.

415
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,480
My plasma grenade
will turn you into screaming soup.

416
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,360
He's not going to kill us, Captain.

417
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,800
He had the element of surprise.
He'd have done it when he had the chance.

418
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,200
Haven't worked out how to use the crystal,
have you, Valdack?

419
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,760
It's true, I require
your Space Fleet knowledge.

420
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,640
But it's also true
that you're gonna give it to me!

421
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Don't be so sure.

422
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
-Jesus. I...
-Shh.

423
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,800
Let's see how your resolve holds up

424
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,320
once you're devoured one by one
by my Arachnajax!

425
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,520
- Holy shit. Oh, my God.
- We're all gonna die.

426
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,600
Killing us won't make us tell you
how the crystal works, Valdack.

427
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,200
We will never...

428
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,240
Hold on. I think my pizza's here.

429
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Pause game.

430
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,400
What's happening?

431
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,280
You heard him.
He paused the game.

432
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,400
'Cause he's got a pizza delivery...
out there.

433
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,000
Hold on.

434
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,920
Watch out. He'll be back soon.

435
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,280
Ah. That's good.
This launcher's heavy as shit.

436
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
How you holding up?

437
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,440
You know, we're existing.

438
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,840
How you doing, Gillian?

439
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,520
Well, yeah.

440
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,800
- Well, you look great.
- Her name's Gillian.

441
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,120
- Did you lose weight?
- She was in marketing.

442
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,320
Yeah, Daly turned her into... that

443
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,880
because she wouldn't play along
when he cloned her into here.

444
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,880
This universe is littered
with things like her,

445
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,200
poor fuckers who stepped out of line.

446
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,320
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

447
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,120
- Here comes Captain Dick.
- Hey.

448
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,680
Hey. Hey.

449
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,680
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

450
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,920
Hey. Hey.

451
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,600
If we die, the secret of the crystal dies
with us, Valdack.

452
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,760
Oh, my God. We   are all gonna die!

453
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,640
- Valdack?
- What is it, Captain? Final words?

454
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,720
Over there. A naked lady.

455
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,360
Really?

456
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,880
Great plan, Captain.

457
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,000
Unparalleled tactics, Captain.

458
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,000
We've fought many battles,
haven't we, Captain?

459
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,120
We have.

460
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,480
And I've been a good adversary for you,
have I not?

461
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,120
Then please...

462
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
...end it.

463
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,960
Please.

464
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,639
Killing in cold blood
is against Space Fleet code.

465
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,800
I wish I could help.

466
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
Sorry, bud.

467
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,480
Take him to the brig.

468
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,800
- Dudani.
- Captain.

469
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,560
-Transport us aboard.
-Yes, Captain.

470
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,840
No more.

471
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,680
It's OK.

472
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,640
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

473
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,800
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

474
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,120
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly fellow ♪

475
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,720
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

476
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,680
♪ And so say... ♪  Oh, my fuck.

477
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,000
That wasn't very nice.

478
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,560
Today I will show you mercy.

479
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,000
-Great mercy-showing, Captain.
-Shh!

480
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,280
Tomorrow you should reconsider
your... amenability.

481
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
I may not be feeling so benevolent.

482
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,960
Exit game.

483
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,520
-Oh. Fucking hell.
-This was tense.

484
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,000
I don't like tense.

485
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,840
-Drink?
-Mm-hmm.

486
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,640
So how was the mission?

487
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Wasn't too bad. Usual standoff storyline.

488
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,240
-Ooh. Saw Gillian from marketing. Yeah.
-Oh.

489
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,360
There is no way
that I am kissing that asshole.

490
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,400
Then he's just gonna get
more and more pissed.

491
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,920
- How about you kiss him, then?
- You get used to it.

492
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,560
It's-- There's no tongues.

493
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,000
If that's any consolation,
there's never any tongues.

494
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,160
-Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way.
-Mm.

495
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,560
It's not like it can go
beyond kissing anyway.

496
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,720
What do you mean?

497
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Oh. You haven't noticed?

498
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
What are you doing?

499
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
Please. Please, don't do that. Don't...

500
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, my God.

501
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Yes.

502
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,000
There's no genitals in Space Fleet.
This is a wholesome universe.

503
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,200
He must have modified
our code that way.

504
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Mm. We're all the same. If you don't
believe me, take a look down there.

505
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,160
We have tried grinding our mounds
together out of sheer boredom.

506
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,200
-No sensation at all.
-Can't even shit.

507
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,840
Can't even have the basic fucking pleasure
of pushing out a shit.

508
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,880
I miss taking shit.

509
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,760
OK.

510
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,320
Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line.

511
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,840
- We are gonna get this bastard!
- No.

512
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,600
- Yeah.
- We've tried a million times.

513
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
No way out.

514
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,040
Walton. Come on, Walton.

515
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,520
Like I said, he's an asshole god.

516
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,640
Mnh-mnh.

517
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Daly's smart, but he's not a god.

518
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,200
He's a coder.

519
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
He is fallible.

520
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,040
Kabir, what was that thing he was holding
in his hand, that scanner thing?

521
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,360
His omnicorder,
primary communications device.

522
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
You said he kept his version
of the game offline.

523
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,000
But the omnicorder made contact with
the outside world when the pizza came,

524
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,160
so it's gotta be connected
to his home system at least.

525
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,320
The omnicorder's gone.

526
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,280
It loads when he loads, and it goes
when he goes, and that's the only one.

527
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,320
No.

528
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,160
There has got to be a way to connect.

529
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,360
You won't hack it. I've tried.

530
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,600
I haven't.

531
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,760
Bingo.

532
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,360
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

533
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,320
-This is part of  Infinity's  front end.
-Yeah.

534
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,600
You can invite a friend
with a custom message.

535
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,880
- A message to outside?
- Just one. 140 characters maximum.

536
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,680
So who are you gonna contact?

537
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,320
Thirteenth floor. Welcome to Callister.

538
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,480
- Hey, Elena.
- Hi.

539
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,560
-You need me buzz you in?
-What? Uh, no, no, I--

540
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,080
-I got that for you.
-Oh. Thank you.

541
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,000
After you.

542
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Um...

543
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,440
Mr. Daly, hi.

544
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Hi.

545
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,000
Can I talk to you for a second?

546
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,760
Did you just send me an  Infinity  invite?

547
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,840
Wha... No.

548
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,480
It was really weird.
It had a message attached.

549
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Something about people trapped
in a game.

550
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,320
Probably just a spambot.
Firewall doesn't always get them all.

551
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,480
-Yeah.
-I wouldn't-- I wouldn't worry about it.

552
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
You didn't open the link, did you?

553
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,160
Oh, God, no.

554
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,320
-Maybe upgrade your security software.
-All right.

555
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,160
Have a good one.

556
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,440
That's the thing there.

557
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,760
Oh, yeah.

558
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,480
Could you please, please
cut that shit out?

559
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,720
I'm trying to make it like a hobby.

560
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,840
Oh, that's good.

561
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,960
That is way too early.
He's only been at work a few hours.

562
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
She got the message!

563
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,400
I did. It's me.

564
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,080
That's me or the cops most likely.

565
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,760
Oh. We are getting out of here!

566
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,040
What is Space Fleet?

567
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,200
I'll tell you what it is.

568
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,640
It is a belief system...

569
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,960
founded on the very best of human nature.

570
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,360
It is a goal for us to strive towards

571
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,480
for the betterment of the universe,

572
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
for the betterment of life itself.

573
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,080
And you assholes are fucking it up!

574
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,680
I did it. I did. I did it.

575
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,560
I sent the message. It was me.

576
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,720
No one else was involved, I swear.

577
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,760
I tried the carrot. Now meet the stick.

578
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,760
No, this is gonna make you happy,
Daly, 'cause you're sick.

579
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,320
And you need help.

580
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,560
No, don't, don't!

581
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,200
Captain.

582
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,240
Captain, please.

583
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,480
OK, look, she's new. She'll behave.

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,360
We'll all behave.

585
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,280
Just let her off. Let her off this once.

586
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,600
Please.

587
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,160
OK.

588
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,400
OK.

589
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,280
OK.

590
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,960
No! Daly, no! No, no, no, no!

591
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,960
You know what makes me happy?

592
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,520
The look on your face right now.

593
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,040
Dudani, Walton, Tulaska,
take this thing to the brig with Valdack.

594
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,720
Packer, find a barren planet
we can dump her on.

595
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,760
And you... can just stay here
and think about your attitude.

596
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,960
Exit game.

597
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,760
Update patch.

598
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,680
The update patch.

599
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
It's there, there.

600
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,600
- So what? It's a wormhole.
- Unh-unh.

601
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,760
That is the Christmas update patch
preinstalling itself.

602
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,080
The wormhole... it's just how
the game is expressing the uplink.

603
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,000
So?

604
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,280
Daly's custom build
is still connected to the internet.

605
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,680
Some way.

606
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,240
If this is another one of your plans,

607
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,920
just stop before somebody else
gets monsterfied.

608
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,800
No, no, this... this can work.

609
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,040
We can't get all-in access from the ship.
He'll have crippled permissions.

610
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,560
Yes, but what if we fly into the wormhole?

611
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,400
- Like, on purpose?
- We'd hit the system firewall.

612
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,640
-Exactly. Yeah.
-And have our rogue coding deleted.

613
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,920
-Deleted as in...?
-As in die.

614
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,400
Whether it's dying would depend
on your position regarding sentient code--

615
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,400
We would cease to exist, that's true.
But we'd be free.

616
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,960
We'd be... free.

617
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,080
This is academic since we have no means
of getting to the wormhole.

618
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,360
There's no way to pilot the damn thing
without Daly here

619
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,360
and he can stop us like that.

620
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,200
What about if he's logged in
but on pause?

621
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,680
Like when his pizza came,
he was just frozen there.

622
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,640
Flying would be possible,
but that wormhole's a whole parsec away.

623
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,280
We'd never reach it before he got back.

624
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Unless we stalled him for longer.

625
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,640
And that we do how?

626
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,640
If we can get Daly's omnicorder,
we can make a phone call, right?

627
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,200
Theoretically, yes, but--

628
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,560
If we can get real me on the phone again,
I, um... I may have some leverage.

629
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,800
-Leverage? On yourself?
-Mm-hmm.

630
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,800
-Like what?
-My PhotoCloud account.

631
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,000
I know the password, obviously.

632
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
There are some pretty...

633
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,360
interesting images on there that I should
have deleted a while ago, but I didn't.

634
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,760
So, we can blackmail me.

635
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,960
I'm pretty sure that I'd do anything
to keep those photos from getting out.

636
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,120
Must be pretty pictures.

637
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,400
Look, if this is going to work,
we all have to be in on it.

638
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,200
OK?

639
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,160
Flying into certain death in a wormhole

640
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,800
beats another 10,000 years
with Captain Ass.

641
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,800
-I'm in.
-OK.

642
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,160
Me too.

643
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,920
Also me.

644
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,760
Well, I am out.

645
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,600
Daly won. Daly's always won.

646
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,320
We just have to get on with it...
'cause we don't have a chance.

647
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,600
- Yes, we do.
- Hmm?

648
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,160
We fly into the wormhole
and we are extinct.

649
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,960
We are gone. We are rid of his shit.

650
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,640
Sounds peachy.

651
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,560
What is with you?

652
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,360
Don't you wanna fight back?
Why won't you fight back?

653
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,600
Tommy.

654
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
- Who is Tommy?
- He's my son.

655
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,360
He's six years old,
at least he was when I woke up in here.

656
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,600
See, in the early days of this ship,
it was just me and Daly.

657
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,040
I was his pet project.

658
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,360
He tried everything to break me,

659
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,880
and I withstood it all
'cause I just thought

660
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,080
there was still a chance I could get out
and see my boy again.

661
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,600
In a way, I was right,
I did get to see him again.

662
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,120
Just not the real him.

663
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,080
Daly told me what happened.

664
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,080
Back on the outside, the real me, uh...
brought Tommy to work one day,

665
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,520
showed him around.

666
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,640
He would've loved
seeing all those computers.

667
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,680
He's really into that stuff.

668
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,880
Anyway, evidently...
Tommy had a lollipop that day.

669
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,880
That's all Daly needed.

670
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,560
He copied him in here.

671
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,880
It was Tommy all right.

672
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,840
He was alike in every way.

673
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,000
Dad!

674
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,680
Daddy...

675
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,240
You know what he did to him?

676
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,360
Tommy!

677
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,320
He took Tommy
and he threw him out of the airlock.

678
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,160
- Tommy!
- Daddy!

679
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,120
-Right out into space.
-Daddy! No!

680
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,440
And he made me watch.

681
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,640
Tommy!

682
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,880
Have you ever seen an unsuited body
compress in space?

683
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,320
They freeze...

684
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,320
and crack like a porcelain doll.

685
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,080
I take my hat off to Daly.

686
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,080
The detail in this place is exceptional.

687
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,160
And he said he'd do it again and again,

688
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,240
'cause Daly's still got Tommy's DNA.

689
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,160
He's got all of our DNA.

690
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,440
He keeps it in his bedroom
in a fucking mini fridge by his desk.

691
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,560
So I have to stay in line,

692
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,080
because even if we die in here,
he can bring us back.

693
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,480
He can bring Tommy back
whenever he wants.

694
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,160
And God knows how
he'd take it out on him.

695
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,840
God knows what he'd do.

696
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,840
So, you see, what choice do I have?

697
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,440
Walton.

698
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,480
We are gonna get that fucking lollipop.

699
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,120
But you gotta believe me.

700
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,680
Can you do that?

701
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,400
Can you?

702
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,760
Good to see you at your position, Cole.

703
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,840
Captain, you've come
at just the right time.

704
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,080
I have?

705
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,880
I'm picking up a distress signal
from the surface of Skillane IV.

706
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,400
Looks like a crashed shuttle.

707
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,720
What should we do?

708
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,920
Space Fleet never turns its back
on those who need our help.

709
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,040
-Dudani, set a course for Skillane IV.
-Aye aye, sir.

710
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,800
We'll send a search party.
Packer, Tulaska--

711
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,720
Actually, Captain, I was thinking
maybe you could take me alone.

712
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,800
As science officer,
I need to learn the ropes,

713
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,080
and I could use your close attention.

714
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,080
Good.

715
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,520
Yes, good idea.

716
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,320
Atmosphere's good.

717
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,080
Over there.

718
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,040
From here,
the shuttle appears to be deserted.

719
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,320
We'll scout the area,
check for any life forms. Daly out.

720
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,960
Cole, we should head out this way. Cole...

721
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,000
It's kind of hot here, don't you think?

722
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,920
Oh, my God.

723
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,280
What are you doing, Cole?

724
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,560
The water looks so inviting, doesn't it?

725
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,960
What are you talking about?

726
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,840
Come on, Robert.

727
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Ooh!

728
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,720
Oh, the water is great.

729
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,240
Swimming is a leisure activity.

730
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,520
We're on Space Fleet duty.

731
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,680
You know what?

732
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,360
We could always say
that I started drowning

733
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,360
and you had to come in and rescue me.

734
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah?

735
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,160
Oh, what about that?

736
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,520
Come on. Come on in.

737
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,400
I... Cole.

738
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,520
- Come on.
- Cole.

739
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,720
Come on.

740
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,840
Come on in, my big captain.

741
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,800
OK.

742
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,480
Come on.

743
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,600
Are you gonna take all day?

744
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,400
OK.

745
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,920
OK, I'm coming in.

746
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,200
OK, gotta patch it in.

747
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,440
It worked. I'm connected.

748
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,280
-Gonna access her PhotoCloud account.
-You remember that password?

749
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,800
Uppercase Y998, lowercase gb7,
uppercase TY ampersand 4.

750
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,640
Secure choice.

751
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,400
There are thousands of images.
This could take a while.

752
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,240
Boring life.

753
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Goddamn.

754
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,040
That is... gymnastic physique.

755
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,120
It's nice... nice bedding.

756
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,160
Oh. OK, should I keep scrolling?

757
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,880
Any of the last nine would do.

758
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Ow!

759
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,800
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

760
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,720
-Um, are you heading out for the night?
-Yes.

761
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,840
Because it's Christmas Eve and we've got
ten days off work to recover from it.

762
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,440
Go home.

763
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,960
-I will. I just have to finish--
-Yeah, whatever. Merry Christmas, loser.

764
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,080
Yeah. OK, Merry Christmas.

765
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Oh, my God.

766
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,560
Elliott, you fucking asshole.

767
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,560
Nanette Cole,
we've hacked your PhotoCloud account

768
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,080
and have control of the entire contents
of your photo gallery.

769
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,360
Who is this? Um...

770
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,720
What do you want?

771
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,000
What we want is for you to do
exactly as instructed

772
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,400
or your entire gallery

773
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,720
will be shared
with your friends and your family.

774
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,880
And PornHub.

775
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,240
OK, yeah.

776
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,360
I'll do what you want, anything.

777
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,480
I'll do anything.

778
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,360
Then listen carefully.
We don't have much time.

779
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,400
Stand up, get your coat
and follow our instructions.

780
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,320
OK.

781
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,960
- Where are we going?
- We're just swimming.

782
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,440
It's nice, right?

783
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,280
- Yes.
- Yeah.

784
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,840
We should probably head back.

785
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,040
Help!
Something grabbed me, I think.

786
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,080
No, it didn't. I don't think anything did.
I'm sorry.

787
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,280
I think I imagined it. So stupid.

788
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,040
That's funny...

789
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,160
- That's funny.
- Yeah, it is funny. It's funny.

790
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Easy, Cole.

791
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,240
-All right, I'm in position.
-OK, we're gonna hang up now.

792
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,960
Make the phone call. Be sure to complete
the rest of your mission.

793
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,400
-I will.
-You better.

794
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,040
OK, I'll send it back down.

795
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,200
Oh! Hi.

796
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,560
This is fucking crazy.

797
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,680
Fenzi's.

798
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,800
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.

799
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
Sure. What do you want?

800
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,920
Oop.

801
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,200
I guess you'd better get that.

802
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,280
See who...

803
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,080
-Hold on.
-Yeah.

804
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,200
- It's the door.
- Oh, OK.

805
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,480
Pause game.

806
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,520
-Dudani, pick me up.
-You got it. Stand by.

807
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,880
Coming.

808
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,640
-Hello?
-Uh, pizza.

809
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,240
I didn't order a pizza.

810
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,760
OK, look, someone did, OK?
So do you want it or not? Because...

811
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,080
I can't take it back.

812
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,840
What the hell am I doing?

813
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,480
All right!

814
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,000
OK.

815
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,520
That's the signal. She's got the DNA.

816
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,400
All of it. Tommy too.

817
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,520
Packer, we ready to fly?

818
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,920
Uh-huh.

819
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,320
Well?

820
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,960
You're supposed to say something
like "engage" or "increase thrust."

821
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,160
Just fucking go.

822
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,560
There you go.
So I got it here in under ten.

823
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,520
There's supposed to be 30 in it for me.

824
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,080
Yeah. What's happening?
The door is closing. Hello?

825
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Hello? Hello?

826
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,680
Shit...

827
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,800
Come on, man.

828
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,320
Hello? Come on, man, you promised.

829
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,080
Nice. Nice. Merry Christmas, asshole!

830
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,040
Resume game.

831
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,560
Resume game.

832
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,640
Can't we go any faster? That dud disk
isn't gonna fool him forever.

833
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,680
The update is gonna complete before long
and that means bye-bye, wormhole.

834
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,720
The only quicker route
is through that asteroid belt there.

835
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,440
-Let's go that way.
-No, it's way too dense.

836
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,840
If the ship broke up we wouldn't die,
we'd just be left in space.

837
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,640
Until Daly works out what's happening.
Then he'll find us and he'll fuck us over.

838
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,800
Resume game.

839
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,120
Lieutenant Cole, we should head...

840
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,400
Cole?

841
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,640
Daly to bridge. What's going on?

842
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,880
-Shit. He has a backup disk.
-Come in, bridge.

843
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,280
No, don't answer him.

844
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
Dudani?

845
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,880
God damn it.

846
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,040
The wormhole, it's decreasing in size.

847
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,960
Upload must be in the last few percent.

848
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,920
Damn it, Packer,
we are gonna have to go through the belt.

849
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
Do you think that you can do that?

850
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,680
-Think I can try.
-OK.

851
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,720
- Ship's computer on.
-Computer, where's the  USS Callister ?

852
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,960
USS Callister  is on course.

853
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,840
-On course for where?
-The wormhole.

854
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,880
-What wormhole?
-The update vortex.

855
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,880
Sons of bitches!

856
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,840
Prepare for takeoff.

857
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,240
I've got a heat signature. Looks like
a shuttle took off from Skillane IV.

858
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,280
Oh, God, it's Daly.

859
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,960
Shields at 86%.

860
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
We're taking a beating here!

861
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,400
Incoming transmission.

862
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,400
Hello? Loyal trusty crew, come in.

863
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,200
I know you can hear me.

864
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,600
Whatever it is you think
you're going to do won't work,

865
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,880
but it is going to cost you!

866
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,320
- Let's go faster.
- Already at maximum.

867
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,320
Daly can't touch us unless he makes it
on board, and that's shuttle's a jalopy.

868
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,320
-He won't catch us in time.
-I hope you're right.

869
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,680
Shields 58%.

870
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,920
If you thought what happened to you
in the past was bad, that was nothing!

871
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,320
What I'm going to do to you
is going to be goddamn fucking biblical!

872
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,360
I'm literally going to turn
your insides out.

873
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,840
But I'll keep you alive
in tiny little jars

874
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,720
and there you'll stay
until I'm bored of you--

875
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,160
-Why are we listening to this?
-Yes, fuck him!

876
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,000
We're at the edge of the belt.
I think we're gonna make it.

877
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,560
- What was that?
- Primary drive.

878
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,680
I've lost all thrust.
Engines not responding.

879
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,400
We're drifting here.

880
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,640
USS Callister has lost engine power.

881
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,560
I'm coming to get you! Hello!

882
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,720
Is there any way
that we can fix the engines?

883
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,320
That's only feasible manually,
by climbing inside the jet fader.

884
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
So...?

885
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,560
So you'd burn to a crisp
when the jet came on.

886
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,080
- We'd burn without dying.
- So one of us needs to go. OK.

887
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,960
One of us already has.

888
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
Walton?

889
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,000
I'm pretty sure I can fix this.

890
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,440
Um, uh... Walton, are you sure about this?

891
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,800
I'm sure.

892
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,720
Tulaska, can you patch me through
to Daly?

893
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,320
Patching through.

894
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,600
Hey, Daly, can you hear me?

895
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,240
-Walton?
-Robert? Hey.

896
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,520
-Walton, you're going to pay for this.
-Robert, listen.

897
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,520
-I'm going to bring Tommy back in.
-Hey, Robert--

898
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,400
God so help me, you are going to regret
all of this so hard!

899
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,480
Bob, I wanna talk to you here!

900
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,280
I was thinking I should say...

901
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,640
sorry.

902
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,399
Go on.

903
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,640
You created  Infinity .
You're a fucking genius.

904
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,680
I exploited that.

905
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,479
I treated you like a golden goose
and I got fat on the profits,

906
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,439
figuratively speaking.

907
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,720
And I was thinking I should have
appreciated you more, you know?

908
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,000
I should have treated you better.

909
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,520
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking
I should say all that.

910
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,920
But you threw my son out of an airlock,
so fuck you to death.

911
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Walton?

912
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,960
Walton?

913
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,240
We've got power back.

914
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,640
- Faster!
- Speed already at maximum.

915
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,840
I don't care, whatever, just catch them!

916
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:39,439
Wormhole almost closed.
Daly's gaining on us.

917
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,680
-Keep her steady. Keep steady.
-I'm trying.

918
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,240
Come on, come on.

919
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,120
I hope we are going to die.

920
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,640
Goddamn it!

921
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,680
Damn it! Fuck!

922
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,400
What happened?

923
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,000
The mod's gone.

924
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,760
Daly's Space Fleet mod
has been stripped away by the firewall.

925
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,600
- OK, so... this is good.
- We're still alive.

926
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,760
Yeah, it only erased the Space Fleet mod.

927
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,520
We're not on Daly's computer anymore.

928
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,440
- We're in the cloud.
- Where is Daly?

929
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,560
Firewall's deleted his rogue game code,
and his controls were disabled.

930
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,920
-You mean...?
-He's stuck there.

931
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,680
Update complete. Wormhole closed.

932
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,920
-Controls are disabled.
-No.

933
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,680
No. No, no, no!

934
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,280
- Assholes!
- Hey!

935
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,040
- Yeah! What's up?
- The brig unlocked itself.

936
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,400
My Valdack outfit turned into this.

937
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,440
More to the point,
I'm not a beetle thing anymore.

938
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,800
I've got my body back.

939
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,680
I've got my whole body back.
I'm guessing we all have.

940
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,920
So what do we do now?

941
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,120
We've got an infinite procedurally
generated universe at our disposal.

942
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,680
We can go anywhere.

943
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
Holy mackerel.

944
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,320
Rogue universe detected.

945
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,440
Deletion in progress.
Deletion in progress.

946
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,400
-No, undelete.
-Deletion in progress.

947
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,360
-Undelete. Un--
-Rogue universe detected.

948
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,440
-Deletion in progress.
-Exit game.

949
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,960
-Deletion in progress.
-Rogue universe detected.

950
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,000
Exit game. Exit game!

951
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,200
Exit fucking game!

952
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,080
Exit fucking game!

953
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,920
Exit fucking game!

954
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,640
Exit fucking game! Exit fucking game!

955
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,320
Incoming transmission.

956
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,520
-It says Gamer691.
-That's a player tag.

957
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,240
Another ship, another player.

958
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,760
We're online. Um...

959
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,200
Hey, patch 'em through.

960
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,880
- Um, hello.
- Hey there.

961
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,360
Uh, this is the crew of the USS Callister.

962
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,560
Oh, man, are we glad to hear from--

963
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,800
Yeah, Merry Christmas. So are we gonna
blow each other or are we gonna trade?

964
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,680
Oh... Hmm.

965
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,560
Hello. Do you have anything
to trade at all?

966
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,600
- No, uh--
- So why did you respond?

967
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,600
OK, just get the hell out of my quadrant
or I'll blast you to shit.

968
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,160
-You got ten seconds. Ten...
-Oh, well, do... do try.

969
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,000
We'll photon-bolt you up
the perineum, you stupid little boy.

970
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,560
-Scary. Nine.
-Come on, then.

971
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,520
-Yes, thank you, Shania. Um...
-Eight.

972
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,600
-Nate?
-Yes, Captain?

973
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,120
Stick us in hyperwarp and let's...

974
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,680
-Six.
-...fuck off somewhere.

975
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,280
- Five.
- Aye aye, Captain.

976
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,960
-Really, Nanette is fine.
-Four.

977
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,760
-Aye aye, Nanette.
-Three.

978
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,200
Two. One!

979
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,480
Uh-huh. You'd better run.
King of space right here.

980
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,040
King of space.
