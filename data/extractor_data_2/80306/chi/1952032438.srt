1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:13,013
是, 大臣  第1季第4集

2
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:42,309
专制国家 (老大哥是奥威尔所著1984
中的独裁者象征 已成为专制的代名词)

3
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,113
摄制准备 一分钟后开始录制
Recording in one minute. Studio stand by.

4
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,118
我们会讨论削减政府的铺张浪费 对吗
We'll talk about cuts in government extravagance, aren'twe?

5
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,453
在结束国家资料库的相关问题后
We'll get to that if we've got time

6
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,522
如果还有时间我们就展开这个话题
afterthe National Data Base.

7
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,893
我可不觉得民众对资料库会感兴趣
I don't think people are really interested in the Data Base.

8
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,161
太琐碎了
It's so trivial.

9
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,329
摄像机就位
VTrunning.

10
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,865
这是干吗?      你的脸看上去太红了(pink有左倾之义)
What's the matter? You look a bit too pink.

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,001
脸红可不行 《每日电讯报》会怎么评论?
We can't have that, whatwould the Daily Telegraph say?

12
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,305
铺天盖地的"我们正在迈向极权国家?"
All those questions about "are we creating a police state?"

13
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,074
相信我 这点可以忽略      吉姆 你了解我
We can do without those. Jim, you knowme.

14
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,276
我不会事先透露提问内容
I don't give out my questions in advance.

15
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,078
请都保持安静
Dead silence, please.

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,646
10秒倒数
Ten seconds...

17
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,084
5 4 3 2 …
Five. Four. Three. Two...

18
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,486
晚上好
Good evening.

19
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,656
老大哥正在监视你吗? 更准确来说
Is Big Brotherwatching you? To be more precise,

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,793
你知不知道政府正在建立你的档案库
the Government is building up a dossieron you.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,162
还起了个听上去并无危害的名字
It's called by the harmless name of

22
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,364
"国家综合资料库"
"National Integrated Data Base".

23
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,267
只需轻轻一按 任何公务员都能
At the press of a button any civil servant

24
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,337
查阅你一生中的每个微小环节
can inspect just about every detail of your life

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,874
纳税 病史档案 失业次数
yourtax, yourmedical record, periods of unemployment,

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,076
孩子的成绩 一应俱全
children's school records, and that civil servant

27
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,212
而这个公务员可能恰好是你的邻居
may happen to be yourneighbour.

28
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,415
人们日益关注这一由计算机革命
There's been mounting concern overthis powerful,

29
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,318
为政府带来的强有力的
even totalitarian weapon that the computer revolution

30
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,354
极权主义武器
has put into the Government's hand.

31
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,423
而挥舞这根大棒的人就是
And the man who wields the weapon is the Minister

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,394
行政事务大臣 下院议员詹姆斯・哈克阁下
forAdministrative Affairs, the Right Honourable James Hacker.

33
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,231
大臣 我们正为一个极权国家添砖加瓦吗
Now, Minister, are we laying the foundations of a police state?

34
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:15,269
我很高兴你问了这个问题
You know, I'm glad you asked me that question.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,106
那么 大臣 我们能得到答复吗
Well, Minister, could we have the answer?

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,510
当然可以 我正要回答 如果可以的话
Well, yes of course, I'm about to give it to you, if I may.

37
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,513
正如我所说 我很高兴你询问了这个问题
As I said, I'm glad you asked me that question.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,681
因为
Because...

39
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,184
这个问题
it's a question

40
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,753
许多人在问
a lot of people are asking.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,921
为什么呢?
And why?

42
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,791
因为大家愿闻其详
Because a lot of people want to know the answerto it.

43
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,962
就不转弯抹角了
And let's be quite clearabout this without beating about the bush,

44
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,832
这个问题明摆着的事实就是
the plain fact of the matter is

45
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,602
它的确极其重要
that it's a very important question indeed

46
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,104
民众有权知道
and people have a right to know.

47
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,944
可是大臣 我们还是没能闻其详
But Minister, we haven't yet had the answer.

48
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,147
不好意思 问题是什么?
I'm sorry, whatwas the question?

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,084
好吧 假设我在访谈中激怒了你
Now look, supposing I annoy you in this interview,

50
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,653
我怎么知道你不会回到办公室
how do I know you won't go back to youroffice,

51
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,323
轻轻一按 提出我的纳税记录
press a button and call up my tax records,

52
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,159
医疗记录 违归记录
my hospital records, my police record...

53
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,427
不会 不会
Oh no. No. No.

54
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,296
鲍勃 这不是我们国家的做事方式
Bob, that's not the way we do things in this country.

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,067
如果资料库不是用来核查民众 那是做什么用的呢?
What's the Data Base for if it's not to check up on people?

56
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,638
你看 这是个非常有趣的问题
You know, that's a very interesting question.

57
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,108
是用来保存信息
It's forstoring information

58
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,478
加速政府的运转
so as to speed up government business

59
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,883
我们就无需雇佣庞大数量的文案人员
so thatwe need not take on an enormous influx of clerical staff.

60
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,553
计算机是个大进步 是佳音
Computers are big business and are good news.

61
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,856
可是 大臣 你要是把信息输入机器
But, Minister, if you put information into the machine,

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,792
你有朝一日就会从机器中读出这些信息
you'll eventually take information out of the machine.

63
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,762
这倒未必
Not necessarily.

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,533
这么说 你花了2千5百万英镑
So, you're going to spend 25 million pounds

65
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,868
收集信息却永远不用?
accumulating information and neveruse it?

66
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,005
不是 是的 不是
No. Yes. No.

67
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:01,241
会有安全措施的
Well, there will be safeguards.

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,075
例如?
Such as?

69
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,345
镜头拉近  他在躲闪鲍勃的问题
Close in on him, Two. Bob's got him on the run.

70
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,947
摄制 1分45
One minute 45, studio.

71
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,150
我们会关注所有的可能性
We'll be looking at a whole range of possibilities.

72
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,054
当然 这是件复杂并具有高科技的事情
And of course, it's a complex and highly technical matter.

73
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,089
冰冻三尺非一日之寒啊
Rome wasn't built in a day.

74
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,592
还在审核中
It's underreview.

75
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,094
当然 这需要假以时日
And of course, these things take time.

76
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,665
大臣 我是在与《改革》的前任编辑谈话
Minister, am I talking to the formereditorof Reform

77
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,600
还是在和一个公务员发言人呢?
orto a Civil Service spokesman?

78
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,536
我们还没就我提到的安全措施展开论述
We haven't talked about the safeguards I've introduced.

79
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,873
例如 我新成立的行政监察办
And there's my newbureaucratic watchdog office, for instance.

80
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,411
看似不久我们会需要一大群看门狗了
It doeslook asif we'll needa whole pack of watchdogs before long.

81
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,146
还是十分感谢
But thank you very much.

82
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,549
好啦 请稍等片刻 我们要核对录影
Right, hold it there while we check the tape.

83
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:46,453
如何? 我想第一节进展的非常好
How did it go? Well, I thought... First class Very good indeed.

84
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,121
我似乎扯多了
I thought I waffled a bit.

85
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,191
不 大臣 你"太极"打得好极了
Oh no, you stonewalled superbly, Minister.

86
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,426
去喝一杯?
Time fora drink?

87
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,696
安全措施展开论述
About the safeguards I've introduced.

88
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,465
例如 我新成立的行政监察办
My newbureaucratic watchdog office, for instance.

89
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,035
看似不久我们会需要一大群看门狗了
It sounds as if we'll need a pack of watchdogs before very long.

90
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,604
还是十分感谢
But thank you very much.

91
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,806
下周的话题...
In next week's topic...

92
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,642
我表现如何?     大臣 棒极了
Howwas I?         Splendid, Minister.

93
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,144
非常庄重 非常得体

94
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,347
是的 汉弗莱爵士 祝贺你
Yes, Sir Humphrey, I congratulate you.

95
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,549
吉姆现在训练有素
Jim is nowperfectly house trained.

96
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,451
你告诉他什么他就说什么
He does exactly what you tell him.

97
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,187
打断一下 威瑟尔先生      埃瑟尔
Lf you'll excuse me, Mr. Weasel. Weisel.

98
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,425
你简直就成了公务员的传声筒了
You say everything the Civil Service programmes you to say.

99
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,361
你是人还是喉舌?
What are you a man ora mouth?

100
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,896
很好笑 弗兰克
Very amusing, Frank.

101
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,166
一个政治顾问理解这或许不易
It might be hard fora Political Advisorto understand this,

102
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,234
但我只是个公务员
but I am merely a Civil Servant,

103
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,638
无非是遵照主子的指示
I simply do as I am instructed by my master.

104
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,240
如果部长是个女人你怎么称呼她?
If the Minister's a woman what do you call her?

105
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,242
这的确有趣
Yes, that's rather interesting.

106
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,410
我们想过解决的方法
We sought an answer

107
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,413
1947年我担任首席私人秘书时
when I was Principal Private Secretary and

108
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,548
伊迪丝・萨默基尔博士
Dr. Edith Summerskill,

109
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,717
她于1947年被委任为大臣
as she then was, was appointed Minister in 1947.

110
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,720
我不太愿意称她为我的"主母"
I didn't quite like to refer to heras my Mistress.

111
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,524
怎么解决的?      还没有定论
Whatwas the answer? We're still waiting for it.

112
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,495
还在审核 对吗? "冰冻三尺非一日之寒"
It's underreview, is it? Rome wasn't built in a day.

113
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,864
"这需要假以时日"     我得走了 大臣
These things take time. I must be going.

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,533
我也是      您走之前 我想提醒您
Me too. Before you go Minister may I remind you

115
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,135
别忘了明早8点在帕丁顿饭店见
we meet tomorrowmorning at Paddington at 8?

116
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,771
去哪?     斯旺西(威尔士南部港市) 大臣
Where are we going?      Swansea, Minister.

117
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,708
您将在市财政会议上发表演说
You're addressing the Conference of Municipal Treasurers.

118
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,009
对
Oh, yes.

119
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,346
可是吉姆 你要去纽卡斯尔补缺选举致词
You're due in Newcastle to address the by election meeting.

120
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,281
的确如此     可您无法两个都去
So I am.       You can't do both.

121
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,584
我不能两个都去     吉姆 那不过是公务员的野餐
I can't do both. That's a Civil Service junket.

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,286
补缺选举才重要      补缺选举很重要
The by election's important. It's important.

123
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,890
大臣 会议记录在您的行程表中几周了 他们很期待您的到访
The Conference is in yourdiary. They expect you in Swansea.

124

纽卡斯尔期待您的到访

125
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,628
伯纳 他怎么会有两个约会?     伯纳 我怎么会有两个约会?
How come he's double booked? How come I'm double booked?

126
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,464
主要是纽卡斯尔的事没人告诉我
Well, largely because nobody told me about Newcastle.

127
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,366
你为什么不告诉他?     你为什么不?
Why didn't you tell him? Why didn't you?

128
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,068
我可记不住每件事
I can't remembereverything.

129
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,104
弗兰克 我最好去斯旺西
Frank, I think I'd bettergo to Swansea.

130
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,406
决定了?      是的 最终决定
Is that a decision? Yes, that's final.

131
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,108
首相希望您去纽卡斯尔
The P. M. Expects you to go to Newcastle.

132
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,476
首相?

00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,945
伯纳 我最好去纽卡斯尔
I think I'd bettergo to Newcastle, Bernard.

决定了 吉姆?     是的 最终决定
Is that a decision, Jim? Yes, that's final.

135
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,184
那我回家了     这是最终决定吗?
Now I'm going home. Is that a decision?

136
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,752
不不 说真的
No, quite seriously...

137
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,288
我想您做了错误的决定 大臣
I think you've made the wrong decision.

138
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,757
您到访斯旺西已经对外宣告

140
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,563
找到一个让我从斯旺西到纽卡斯尔的途径
Find a way of getting me from Swansea to Newcastle.

141
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,966

Car, train, helicopter, anything. I'll have to do both.

142
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,536
现在我回家 这是最终决定

取消 我们三个月前就决定了
Cancel them! We booked this three months ago.

你好 伯纳 对 是我

什么真巧? 别傻了

总之 明天我去巴黎 最终决定

是的 我是说过 但这次是最终的
Yes, I said that before, but this time is final!

174
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,308
你要使出全身解数摆平
You'll just have to cope as best as you can.

175
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,477
没错
Yes?

176
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,046
对 很明确
Yes... definitely...

177
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,115
对
Yes...

178
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,550
明白了?
Is that clear?

179
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,251
好的
Right!

180
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,187
我们去巴黎
We're going to Paris.

181
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,856
不 我要去斯旺西和纽卡斯尔
No, I'm going to Swansea and Newcastle.

182
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,996
今晚在电视上看到我了?     我倒是看到有个人像你
See me on TV tonight? I saw somebody who looked like you.

183
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,998
这话的意思是?      什么也不是
What's that meant to mean?     Nothing.

184
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,868
弗兰克说我成了公务员的传声筒
Frank says I've become a Civil Service mouthpiece.

185
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,236
是啊      "是啊"是什么意思?
Yes.          What do you mean, yes?

186
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,238
就是是啊      你是说你同意?
Well... yes.           You mean you agree?

187
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,841
当然      "当然"是什么意思?
Of course.       What do you mean, of course?

188
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,311
你还不如雇人去讲话 没准比你讲的好呢
You could have hired and actor to say it all foryou.

189
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,947
你何不用橡皮图章来签信件
And why not just sign your letters with a rubberstamp?

190
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,516
或者让你的助理代劳
Orget an Assistant Principal to sign them foryou.

191
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,084
反正就是他们写的
They write them anyway.

192
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,187
我的信才不是助理写的呢
Assistant Principals do notwrite my letters!

193
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,790
是副秘书写的
UnderSecretaries do that.

194
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,192
我放弃申辩了 大人
I rest my case, my lord.

195
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,497
你认为我成了傀儡?      是的 我认为是
You think I've become a puppet?      Yes, I do.

196
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,633
也许该让芝麻街的猪小姐做你的工作 她至少比你漂亮
Get Miss Piggy to do yourjob. She's prettier.

197
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,401
我不知如何是好
I don't knowwhat to do.

198
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,704
我被工作困住了
I'm just swamped by the work.

199
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,206
安妮 我真郁闷
Oh, Annie, I'm so depressed.

200
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,310
既然我们不去巴黎
As we're not going to Paris,

201
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,214
至少今晚去街角的饭店吃顿安静的晚餐
let's at least go out fora quiet little dinnertonight.

202
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,049
我不能
No, I can't.

203
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,719
伯纳要我今晚搞定三个红盒子
Bernard's told me to get through three boxes.

204
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,854
什么叫伯纳要求你?
What do you mean, Bernard's told you?

205
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,824
在《改革》做编辑的时候 你可不是这样的
When you edited "Reform" you were quite different.

206
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,226
你走进去 吩咐底下人怎么做
You went in, you told people what to do,

207
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,162
说你要什么 他们就准备什么
and you got what you wanted!

208
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,465
你不先发制人就会被骑在头上
Eitheryou get them by the throat orthey get you by the throat!

209
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,935
那段日子你撕毁多少文章?
Howmany articles did you tearup in those days?

210
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,105
几十篇      那你现在撕毁过多少公文?
Dozens. And howmany official papers?

211
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,108
这是不允许的      不允许?
I'm not allowed to! Not allowed to?

212
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,245
亲爱的 你是大臣 可以为所欲为
Darling, you're the Minister, you can do anything you like.

213
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,585
不 汉弗莱 弗兰克是对的
No, Humphrey, I've decided that Frank was right.

214
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,053
鲍勃・麦肯齐也是
And Bob McKenzie too.

215
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,856
国家数据库必须用其他的方式建立
The National Data Base has got to be organised differently.

216
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:56,990
是的 大臣
Yes, Minister.

217
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,193
确保安全措施到位
We want all possible built in safeguards.

218
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,361
是的 大臣      立刻
Yes, Minister.      Right away.

219
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,431
"立刻"的确切意思是?
What precisely do you mean, right away?

220
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,733
就是马上执行
I mean right away.

221
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,236
懂了 你是指马上执行 大臣?
I see, you mean right away?

222
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,239
汉弗莱 确保到位     好的 大臣
Got it in one, Humphrey. Well, Minister...

223
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,075
或许我该提醒您 我们还尚在内阁成立初期
We are still in the early months of this Government.

224
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,710
还有许多工作...
And there's an awful lot to get...

225
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,946
汉弗莱 资料库的规章必须现在更改
The Data Base rules have got to be changed. Now!

226
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,416
可是您不能 大臣     不 我能 我是大臣
But you can't, Minister. Yes, I can, I'm the Minister.

227
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,318
是的 大臣 您确实是
Yes, indeed you are, Minister.

228
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,154
而且是一位卓越的大臣
And quite an excellent Ministerat that.

229
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,323
汉弗莱 别奉承了
Nevermind the soft soap, Humphrey.

230
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,826
我要让所有公民都有权利查阅自己的档案
I want all citizens to have a right to see theirown files

231
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,663
我要立法惩治未经许可的违规查阅
and I want legislation to make unauthorised access, illegal.

232
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,633
好的 大臣 就这么办     好极了
Very well. It shall be done. Good.

233
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,203
但要立法授权公众采取法律行动
But the legislation necessary to give the public the right

234
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,673
要通过十分繁杂的手续
to take legal action is extremely complicated

235
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,043
还要耗费大量时间来起草
and would take considerable time to draft,

236
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,612
宣传 颁布
promulgate and enact.

237
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,349
公民查阅自己的档案无需立法 对吗
Legislation isn't necessaryfora citizen to see his own files, is it?

238
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,185
是的     那就从这开始
No... Then, we'll startwith that.

239
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,655
好吧 我们会争取快点实施 大臣
I suppose we could manage that slightly quicker,

240
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,125
但还存在许多管理上的难题
but there's an awful lot of administrative problems as well.

241
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,194
汉弗莱 先前对此肯定有过研究
This must have been examined before.

242
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,197
多年前资料库就在筹备中
The Data Base has been in preparation foryears.

243
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,000
肯定就此展开过讨论
There must have been discussions about it.

244
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,069
确实有 大臣      达成的结论是?
Yes, indeed. What conclusions were reached?

245
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,575
汉弗莱 达成的结论是?
Humphrey, what conclusions were reached?

246
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,812
我的前任对此抱何态度?
What did my predecessor want to do about it?

247
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,115
汉弗莱 你能听到我说的吗?
Humphrey, can you hearme?

248
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,285
我必须守口如瓶
My lips are sealed.

249
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,120
再说一遍?
I beg yourpardon?

250
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,256
我不能公开先前的计划 大臣
I am not at liberty to reveal previous plans, Minister.

251
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,424
为什么不能?
Why not?

252
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,228
大臣 您愿意把您在办公室的一言一行
Would you like everything that you have said in this office

253
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,364
都告知随后接任您职务的对手吗?
to be revealed subsequently to one of youropponents?

254
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,466
明白 不
I see. No.

255
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:50,504
我们不能给您对手政治弹药来对付您 反之亦然
We cannot give youropponents political ammunition against you.

256
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,706
可我的前任汤姆・萨金特
But Tom Sargent was my predecessor.

257
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,475
与我是一个党派的 他不会介意的?
It isn't a party political mattersurely?

258
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,245
原则问题 大臣 不能公开
It's a matterof principle. It justwouldn't be...

259
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,316
我明白 我们不能开这种...
I see and we don'twant to do anything thatwouldn't be...

260
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,517
不行
No.

261
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,154
打扰下 大臣     什么事 伯纳?
Oh, excuse me, Minister.      Yes, Bernard?

262
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,889
小问题 大臣
A slight problem, Minister.

263
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,024
由于反对的声浪
Because of the adverse...

264
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,128
就是说 您的访谈并没有获得一致的赞同
not entirelyfavourable press reaction to your interview,

265
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,998
其他频道想让您上他们的节目
the otherChannel wants you fortheirprogramme.

266
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,266
拒绝     不去?
Say no.          No?

267
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,934
是的 不去      好的 不去?
Yes, no.         Yes no?

268
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,905
是的 拒绝 最终决定      要是您这么想
Yes, say no! That's final. Lf that's what you want.

269
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,374
他们说了 就算您不露面 他们还会播出节目
But they would go ahead with the item

270
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,310
那时候可就没人替您维护了
and nobody would be there to state yourcase.

271
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,812
不去? 好吧 去
No? Okay, yes.

272
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,614
不去 好吧 去
No, okay, yes...

273
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,884
我懂您的意思      去
Oh, I see what you mean. Yes.

274
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,385
最后的最终意见?
Finallyfinal?

275
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,487
伯纳 谢谢
Thank you, Bernard.

276
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,825
汉弗莱 安全措施的问题我该怎么说?
What am I going to tell them about safeguards. Humphrey?

277
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,561
您可以提醒他们 大臣
Perhaps you could remind them, Minister,

278
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,930
冰冻三尺非一日之寒
that Rome wasn't built in a day?

279
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,375
汤姆
Tom.

280
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,645
我的朋友     介意我坐下吗?
Oh, my dearfellow.        Mind if I join you?

281
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,113
当然不
No, of course not.

282
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,184
当反对党的滋味如何?
Well, how are you enjoying being in opposition?

283
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,486
执政的感觉如何?
How are you enjoying being in Government?

284
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,824
实际上并非如我期望那般 此刻就不是
Well, not as much as I expected, actually.Well, not at the moment.

285
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,826
汉弗莱把你制服了?
Humphrey got you undercontrol?

286
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,994
想做成点事情真难
It's so hard to get things done.

287
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,964
你办成过什么事吗?      几乎没有
Did you manage to get things done? Oh, almost nothing.

288
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:29,203
我直到选举来临才摸透了他的战术
When I did cotton on to his technique, there was the election.

289
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:32,506
战术?       拖延战术
Technique? Stalling technique.

290
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,676
拖延战术?       有五个阶段
Stalling technique? It comes in five stages.

291
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:40,514
首先 他会跟你说内阁新建 尚有许多事务要处理
First, he'll tell you there's lots of things to be getting on with.

292
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,916
他今早就是这么多我说的      当然了
He told me that this morning.      Quite.

293
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,320
其次 如果你仍然坚持 他会这么说
Then, if you still persist, he'll say something like

294
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,690
"好的 大臣 意图很好
"Ah, yes, Minister, I quite appreciate the intention,

295
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,792
确实应该施行
certainly something ought to be done,

296
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,095
但你肯定这是实施它的正确方式?"
but are you sure this is the rightway to achieve it?".

297
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,663
我应该记下来
I must make a note of this.

298
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,267
如果你还没有被唬住 他会改变立足点
Now, if you are still undeterred, he will shift his ground.

299
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:05,272
从告诉你如何做转向何时做
He will shift from how to do it to when you should do it.

300
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,907
他会这么说
I mean, he'll say,

301
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,911
"大臣 现在不是恰当的时机
"Now, Minister, this is not the right time,

302
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,446
出于各种原因"
forall sorts of reasons".

303
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,349
大臣们就裹足不前了?      多数如此
And Ministers settle forthat?     Well, lots do.

304
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,984
如果你没有放弃
And if you don't,

305
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,386
他会说政策"拟定起来困难重重"
he'll say that the policy"has run into difficulties".

306
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,557
比方说?       技术上 行政上 法律上
Such as?        Technical, political, legal...

307
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,959
法律是最好的托词
Legal are the best sort.

308
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,762
他会使其听起来玄乎其玄
He can make those totally incomprehensible.

309
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,066
走运的话 这个战术会持续三年
And with any luck, this technique will have lasted forthree years

310
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,802
到了最后阶段 他会告诉你
and you'll be at the final stage when he says:

311
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,705
"大臣 下一届大选近在咫尺
"We're getting very close to the next general election.

312
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,874
你能确保这项政策通过?"
Are you sure you can get this policy through?"

313
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,010
三年 怎么能拖了三年?
Howhas it taken three years?

314
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,547
因为你不督促 汉弗莱爵士是绝对什么也不会做的
Sir Humphrey will do absolutely nothing unless you chase him.

315
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,682
而你偏偏还有一堆事情要做
And you've got fartoo much to do.

316
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:52,386
你瞧 他们称之为"创造的惰性"
You see, it's what they call "creative inertia".

317
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,791
你要设法通过什么政策?
What's the policy you're trying to get through anyway?

318
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,928
我试着让国家综合数据库
I'm trying to make this National Integrated Data Base

319
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,763
少些极权主义
a bit less of a Big Brother.

320
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,200
原来是这么回事
Oh, is that what it is?

321
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,169
他告诉你这是新政策 对吧?     是啊
He's told you it's all quite new? Well, yes.

322
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,438
我的朋友 这项法案我们耗了几年
My dearfellow, we spent years on that.

323
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,274
政府白皮书都写好了 可惜大选了
We had a White Paper when they called election.

324
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,843
这些我都做过
I've done it all.

325
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,079
那些行政麻烦呢?      全都解决了
And administrative problems? I've solved them.

326
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,915
他告诉你不能看先前的文件?
And you couldn't see any of the previous papers?

327
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,451
是的      不足为奇 他已经清盘了
yes No wonder. He's wiped the slate clean.

328
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,288
知道他下一步会怎样吗?
D'you knowwhat his next move's gonna be?

329
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,124
不知道      今晚给你几箱文件?
No. Howmany boxes have you got?

330
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,427
3箱? 4箱?       5箱
Three? Four?      Five.

331
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:36,230
他有没有跟你说过不要太担心第5箱?
Did he tell you not to worry about the fifth one?

332
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,465
是的     这就对了 我担保
Yes.           Right. I'll take a bet.

333
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,002
你会在第5个箱子底部找到一个备忘录
You will find at the bottom of the fifth box a memo

334
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,438
详细解释了为何
which explains exactly why

335
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,974
有关资料库的任何新举措必须暂缓
any newmoves on the Data Base

336
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,275
如果你没能发现
must be delayed. If you don't find it,

337
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,645
他将无须盲目行事 但6个月后
he won't do anotherblind thing, but in six month's time

338
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:55,616
他会说他早告诉你了
he'll say that he has told you all about it.

339
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,853
汤姆 你从政多年 对公务员的花招真是无所不晓
Tom you were inoffice foryears.You know allCivil Service tricks.

340
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,656
谈不上无所不晓 老兄 上百种花招而已
Not all, old boy. Just a fewhundred.

341
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:07,728
那么你是如何让他们违心行事的?
And how do you make them do something they don'twant to do?

342
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:12,633
亲爱的朋友 如果我知道就不会在野了
My dearfellow, if I knew that I wouldn't be in Opposition.

343
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,805
可我不理解 汤姆是反对党
But I don't get it. Tom's the opposition.

344
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,607
他为什么告诉你这些?
Why did he tell you all this?

345
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:24,278
反对党并不表示敌对      当然不 我犯糊涂了
The Opposition aren't the opposition. Of course not. Silly of me.

346
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,548
他们只是这么称呼     他们不过是在野的反对党
They are called that. They're the opposition in exile.

347
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,285
那些公务员才是在朝的反对党
The Civil Service are the Opposition in residence.

348
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:35,656
汤姆说在第5个盒子的底部
Now then, bottom of the fifth box, Tom said.

349
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,792
但就算你知道也无能为力
But you can't really do anything.

350
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,093
无能为力?
Oh, can't I?

351
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,763
资料库相关的文件汤姆都给我了
Tom's given me all his papers on the Data Base.

352
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,998
三年的价值
Three year's worth!

353
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:46,533
了不起
Marvellous!

354
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,238
找到了
Found it.

355
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:55,776
竟然被夹在长达80页的福利措施报告里
It had slipped into an 80 page report on Welfare procedures.

356
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,080
"安全措施仍在讨论
"Safeguards still underdiscussion...

357
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:03,016
计划悬而未决
programme not finalised...

358
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,185
"不可草率行动
nothing precipitate...

359
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:09,923
若无相左之指示 建议待发展再定夺"
failing instructions to the contrary, propose await developments".

360
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,091
老一套
Typical!

361
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,795
给汉弗莱打电话 说你不同意    我一早就会见他
Ring Humphrey and tell him. I'll see him first thing.

362
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,798
现在就打给他     现在可是凌晨2点
Ring him now!             It's two o'clock.

363
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,334
他正睡得香呢      要的就是这效果
He'll be fast asleep.            Exactly!

364
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,604
安妮
Annie.

365
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,106
凭什么他安稳入睡你却仍在工作?
Why should he be asleep and you're still working?

366
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,575
他害你白白忙活 现在轮到你整整他
He's had you on the run. Now it's yourturn.

367
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,278
我不能够这么做
I couldn't do that.

368
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,480
他电话多少?
What's his number?

369
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,951
何况材料在第5个盒子里 你根本无法早些看到
Itwas in the fifth box, you couldn't have got to it earlier.

370
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,319
有道理
True.

371
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,871
喂?
Yes?

372
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,841
汉弗莱 这么晚打扰你真不好意思
Humphrey, sorry to ring you so late.

373
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,278
我没破坏你晚餐的兴致吧?
I didn't interrupt you in the middle of dinner, did I?

374
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,015
没有 晚餐早结束了
No, we finished dinner some while ago.

375
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,716
现在几点了?
Oh, good. What's the time?

376
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,351
凌晨两点
Er, two a.m.

377
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,555
我的老天 出了什么大事?      没有 一切正常
Good God, what's the crisis? No. No crisis.

378
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,756
我正在研究盒子
I'm going through my boxes,

379
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,991
而且我知道你肯定也还在鞠躬尽瘁
and I knew you'd still be hard at it.

380
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,195
对的 对的 埋头苦干
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Nose to the grindstone.

381
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,331
那好 我刚看到资料库的文件
Well, I've just come across this Data Base paper.

382
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,466
您发现... 您看过了
Oh, you've found... you've read it!

383
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,870
我得说这让我很不满
Thought I'd bettertell you I'm not happy with it.

384
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,440
你将有幸为此另寻出路
You'll welcome an opportunity to work on something else.

385
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,844
不介意我打电话给你吧     不 大臣 一点也不
You didn't mind my calling you? No. Not at all Minister.

386
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,012
听到您的声音总是非常愉快
Always a pleasure to hearfrom you.

387
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,952
糟了 我忘了告诉他内阁会议前来找我了
I meant to tell him to see me about it before Cabinet.

388
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,386
现在别打给他
Don't ring him now.

389
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,989
是啊 现在是晚了点
You're right, it is a bit late.

390
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,825
让他先睡10分钟
Give him anotherten minutes.

391
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,032
您最好速战速决
If you could be fairly quick.

392
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,835
他10点要参加内阁会议     我可以马上解决
He does have Cabinet at 10.      I can be very quick.

393
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:05,038
伯纳 "不行"是要对大臣说的最简洁的句子
The word "No" is one of the shortest in the language.

394
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:10,077
抱歉来晚了 今早有许多公文要读
Sorry to be so late. Lots of reading to do this morning.

395
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,946
伯纳 早安 谢谢 乔治
Good morning, Bernard. Thank you, George.

396
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,584
汉弗莱 资料库的事
Now, Humphrey, the Data Base.

397
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,287
你起草了安全措施的计划书了吗
Have you drafted yoursafeguards?

398
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,956
大臣 我十分欣赏您的意图
Well, Minister, I quite appreciate your intention

399
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,759
而且非常认同安全措施的必要性
and fully agree that there is need forsafeguards,

400
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:27,427
但是
but is this

401
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,532
这是实施它的正确方式吗?      是我的方式
the rightway to achieve it?        Well, it's my way.

402
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,534
一个对上了
One.

403
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,171
无论如何 我主意已定
That's my decision, anyway.

404
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,208
出于各种因素 现在不是恰当的时机
Well this is not really the time forall sorts of reasons.

405
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,844
两个
Two.

406
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,847
现在正是时候
It's the perfect time.

407
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,516
安全措施应该紧跟系统的步伐
Safeguards should be developed alongside systems,

408
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,084
这是常识
that's common sense.

409
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,355
之前我们已经有过各种尝试 实施起来困难重重
We tried all this before and we ran into all sorts of difficulties.

410
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,757
三个
Three.

411
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,592
比如?
Such as?

412
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,529
例如技术上     不 没问题
Well, technical, for instance. No. No problems.

413
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:05,833
我研究了 我们可以实施与美国国务院
We can use the same basicfile interrogation programme

414
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,969
以及瑞士内政部一样的审核程序
as the U.S. State Dept. And the Swedish Ministry of the Interior.

415
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,704
这个不成问题
No problems there.

416
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,708
好吧 但行政上存在极大的麻烦问题
Yes, but there are also formidable administrative problems.

417
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,513
各部门都会受到影响
And all departments are affected.

418
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:23,484
跨部门委员会...     不不不 汉弗莱
An interdepartmental committee... No. No. No, Humphrey.

419
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:27,721
我想你会发现 现行的安全手续足以胜任
You'll find that the existing security procedures are adequate.

420
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:30,624
只需简单地完善 还有吗?
This is simply an extension. Anything more?

421
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,027
还有 大臣     例如法律问题?
Well, yes, Minister. Legal problems, forexample?

422
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,565
对 大臣      很好 很好
Yes, Minister.      Good, good.

423
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,234
我们有法律权限吗?
Do we have the legal power?

424
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,436
我可以帮你解答 我们有
I'll answer it. We have.

425
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,606
工作人员的职权受到其协议的约束
All personnel affected are bound by theirstaff agreements.

426
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,309
是的 但大臣 这将需要额外配备公务员
Yes, but Minister, there will be a need forextra staffing.

427
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:53,213
你能让其在内阁和议会通过吗
Will you be able to get it through the parliamentary party?

428
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,116
是的 我确定可以 还有其它问题吗?
Yes, I'm quite sure. Anything further?

429
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,152
我看没了 我们可以着手去做了
I don't think so. We can go ahead then.

430
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,558
你不吭声啊 汉弗莱
You're very silent.

431
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,595
大臣 你似乎没意识到荆棘丛丛
You don't seem to realise the amount of work that's involved.

432
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,064
难道你曾调查过安全措施的问题?
Haven't you examined safeguards before?

433
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,733
在其他的内阁里?
Underanothergovernment?

434
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:16,570
我记得在议会上有过类似答辩
I remembersome written answers to parliamentary questions.

435
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,874
首先 我们说好的 这不能...
Well, in the first place as we've agreed that question is not...

436
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:24,344
其次 即便有过调查
In the second place, if there had been investigations,

437
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,814
其实要么没有 要么没必要
which there haven't ornot necessarily,

438
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:29,416
要么我无权透露
orl am not at liberty to say whetherthere have,

439
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,585
那就必然有过一个研究小组
there would have been a project team, which,

440
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,054
其存在过与否 我无可奉告
had it existed, on which I cannot comment,

441
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,623
即便存在过 也已经解散了
which would nowhave disbanded if it had existed

442
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,826
成员已经各自回到曾经的部门
and the members returned to do theirdepartments,

443
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,195
如果真的存在过这些成员的话
if indeed there had been any such members.

444
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,397
或者也可能从没存在过
Ornot as the case may be.

445
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:45,666
正是这样 大臣
Quite so, Minister. I want these safeguards

446
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,635
汉弗莱 我要安全措施立即实施
made available immediately.

447
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,171
大臣 根本不可能      可能
Minister, it is not possible.       It is.

448
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,840
不可能      可能
It isn't.         It is.

449
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,374
不可能      可能
It isn't.           It is.

450
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,144
不可能     可能可能可能可能
It isn't.        'Tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis.

451
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,481
大臣 只是提醒您 内阁会议在10点举行
Just to remind you, you have Cabinet at 10.00,

454
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,554
连个吃饭的空都没有?
Can't you get me out of the lunch?

455
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,756
很抱歉 大臣 已经对外通告过了
I'm afraid not minister.It's been announced.

456
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,358
我想想 我以为我...
I see... I suppose I...

457
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,729
你刚说什么 伯纳?     我们不能更改 大臣
What's that you just said? We can't get out of it.

458
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,065
已经对外通告 已列入日程
It's been announced, it's in the programme.

459
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,334
谢谢 伯纳

468
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,198
大臣
Minister,

469
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,967
如您所知 本周民众对于众所周知的
as you know there's been an outcry this week

470
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,204
公务员官僚部门正在为每个公民
about the dossierthat the Civil Service bureaucracy

471
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:00,707
建立个人档案一事 大声疾呼表示不满
has apparently been building up on every citizen in this country.

472
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,845
现在传言事实并非如此 您个人的政策是
Now, it's rumoured that this is not in fact, yourown policy,

473
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:08,415
您想为公民们实施安全措施
that you'd like to have safeguards forthe individual citizen,

474
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,952
但在玩弄权术的政治舞台上
but that you are being totally frustrated at every stage

475
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,655
您完全彻底地遭到了滑铁卢
of the game by the Civil Service machine.

476
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,025
要知道 戈弗雷
You know, Godfrey,

477
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,595
关于行政部门 颇多微词
there's a lot of nonsence talked about the Civil Service.

478
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,199
其实它是非凡而高效的专业机构
It's a marvellous, efficient, professional organisation,

479
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:28,535
充满活力 高速运转
capable of enormous energy and speed.

480
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,105
它汇集了许多有才干的无私奉献的人们
It's staffed by a lot of talented, dedicated people

481
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:35,676
正尽其所能帮助政府

482
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,511
将政策转化为法律
make it's policies into law.

483
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:41,348
感谢您所做的广告 大臣
Well, thank you forthe commercial, Minister.

484
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:44,318
我们现在可以开始节目了吗?
Perhaps we can start the programme now?

485
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,386
实际上 行政部门和我
The fact of the matter is that the Civil Service and I

486
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:50,157
在整件事上的看法完全一致
are in complete accord overthis whole business

487
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:54,161
我在此高兴地宣布
and I'm happy to announce that we're nowready

488
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:57,531
我们已准备好 将此提议公之于众
to put ourproposals into publication.

489
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:01,735
事实上 今晚我可以说 从9月1日起
In fact, tonight I can say that from Septemberthe first,

490
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,905
英国每位公民都有绝对的权利
every citizen of the U.K. Will have the absolute right

491
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:07,608
查阅自己的私人档案 并核查
to inspect his personal file and check any information

492
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:10,110
任何他曾经向政府提供的信息
that he has eversupplied to the Government.

493
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,645
其次
Secondly,

494
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:16,150
没有大臣的许可 任何公务员将无权
no civil servant will be allowed to examine personal files

495
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,952
查阅其他部门的私人档案
from anotherdepartment, without written authorityfrom a Minister.

496
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,756
我在此宣布 下周将通过一项法案
And I shall be announcing in the House next week legislation

497
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:26,360
授权公民能向任何未经许可
enabling citizens to take legal action against any civil servant

498
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,296
查阅其档案的公务员提出诉讼
who gains unauthorised access to his file.

499
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,533
颇令人鼓舞 大臣
Encouraging, Minister.

500
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,003
您为何不早日宣布 让人民不必为此担心?
Why did you not say so first, and put people's minds at rest?

501
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,174
老实说 我不确信公务员能够按时完成
I didn't believe that the Civil Service could meet ourdeadlines.

502
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,376
但他们让我深信能够做到
But they've convinced me that they can.

503
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,711
而且事实上 我的常务秘书
And, in fact, my Permanent Secretary

504
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,480
以他的名誉向我担保
has staked his reputation on it.

505
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,386
一旦未果 引咎辞职
And if not, heads will roll...

506
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,856
当然 秘书表率
Anyway, Assistant Heads.

507
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,927
大臣 很感谢
Thank you very much, Minister.

508
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,729
不能施行      已经在电视上公布了
It can't be done. It's been announced on TV.

509
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,233
伯纳 你看大臣这是在干什么?
Bernard, what did you make of our Minister's performance?

510
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,770
我 我想这是将了您的军了 汉弗莱爵士
Well, I... I think it's check mate, Sir Humphrey.

511
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,393
汉弗莱 昨晚在电视上看到我了吗?

大臣 经过彻夜的辛苦工作
We have been working very hard all night,

523
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:05,225
你看 我告诉全国你十分杰出 此话非虚
I told the nation how splendid you were and I was right.

524
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,562
我对你非常有信心     的确如此 大臣
I had every confidence in you. Quite so, Minister.

525

你肯定经历了一个难以忘怀的夜晚
You must have had quite a night.

526

也来瞧瞧我的
And here are mine.

529

您也做了详细的建议书?
You have specific proposals too?

530
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,214
我确实做了
Oh, indeed I have.

531
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:30,651
汉弗莱 把你的安全措施念出来
Now, Humphrey, you read out what you've got on safeguards,

532
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:33,854
我同样念出我的 我们来对照下
and I'll read out what I've got and we'll see how they compare.

533
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,960
"个人资料 第一条:
"Personal data 1A:

534

00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:44,798
为准绳
Two criteria.

536
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,768
有无必要与有无权利知道
The need to know and the right to know.

537
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:51,905
第一款 有无必要知道

538

被提供信息的公务员
forwhom the information was submitted may be deemed,

初步视为有必要知道
prime facie, to have a need to know.

541
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:04,084
看来我们英雄所见略同 汉弗莱
We seem to be of the same mind, Humphrey.

542
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,452
的确 大臣

这个提案从哪得来的?
Where did those proposals come from?

544

汉弗莱 我得守口如瓶
Humphrey, my lips are sealed.
