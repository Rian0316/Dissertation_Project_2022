做得不错

276
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,740
Sheldon, we've got to call this off.
Sheldon 我们要赶快取消

277
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,060
No, Leonard.
不要 Leonard

278
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,890
For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies
多少年了 像Kripke一样的无良恶霸
让我的生活悲惨不堪

279
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,580
and humiliating wedgies and the
insensitively named Indian burns.
既被痛打又受尽凌辱 还有印第安刑
(抓住手臂来回扭以产生剧痛)

280
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,990
That stops now.
这些就此打住!

281
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,340
But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance.
可是Sehldon 我们没可能的

282
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,180
The only improvement you were able to make on the
robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
你现在能给这机器人改进的
就是给它遥控器换块新电池

283
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,670
What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:
你没发觉的是Kripke有一个致命伤

284
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,150
overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.
他对机器人大体积超能量的过度自信

285
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,210
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.
那不是过度自信 那叫观察

286
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,590
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.
信我 Kripke很快就会倒在
我的心理战上的 观察吧

287
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,280
Kripke.
Kripke

288
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,600
I would ask if your robot is prepared to
meet its maker, but as you are its maker,
我想问下你的机器人准备好见它制作人没
不过既然你是他的制作人了

289
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,480
clearly the two of you have met.
很明显你们是见过面了

290
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,680
What is his pwoblem?
他脑子怎么鸟?

291
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,150
Way to bust out the
Jedi mind tricks, dude.
学绝地武士心理战还差得远 伙计

292
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,880
I just want to make sure
that we're all clear.
我只是想确认下我们说好了

293
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,850
Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.
按照标准机器人格斗联盟规则

294
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,500
Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight.
你是疯了不成? 这是个街战

295
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,680
The stweet has no rules.
街战哪有什么规则的?

296
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,210
He's right, Leonard. The
paradigm is to the death.
他说得对 Leonard 一直到死为直

297
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,450
I will, however, give you the
opportunity to concede my superiority now
不过我现在给你们个机会承认
我是比你们优越

298
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,880
and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.
然后把你的机器人给我当战利品

299
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,380
Never.
永远都没可能!

300
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,720
I'd rather see Monte
dead than in your hands.
我宁愿Monte死都不要落到你手里

301
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,310
That could be easily arranged.
那真是小菜一碟

302
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,000
Ready, set, go?
各就各位准备开始?

303
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,260
Do it.
来吧

304
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,640
All right then. Weady. Set. Go.
那好吧 预备 开始

305
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,750
Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
来吧 Sheldon 你可以的

306
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,160
Indeed. We are prepared for
anything he can throw at us.
当然 我们做好了万全准备
他怎么对我们都不怕

307
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,690
That's new.
这招是新的

308
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,230
- Run, Monte, run!
- Go, Monte!
- 逃啊 Monte! 逃!
- 闪啊 Mont!

309
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,340
- Monte!
- Go, go, go, go!
- Monte!
- 跑! 跑! 跑! 跑!

310
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,310
Don't hurt us, don't
hurt us, don't hurt us!
别伤害我们! 别伤害我们! 别伤害我们!

311
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Well, so much for making up for
the emotional wounds of childhood.
好了 弥补儿时心灵创伤就到此为止了

312
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,730
I did this.
是我干的

313
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,030
Monte was killed by
my hubris and my pride.
Monte被杀都是因为我的傲慢跟自大

314
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,350
No matter what anybody
says, this is my fault.
不管别人怎么说 这都是我的错

315
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,870
No one's arguing with you, dude.
又没人在跟你争

316
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,310
I got your text. How bad is... Oy.
我收到你短信了 它有多烂... 噢

317
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,970
Forget the robot. What happened to you?
先别管那机器人了 你是怎么了?

318
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,630
He slipped and fell.
他不小心滑倒了

319
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
Yes, I slipped and
fell. In the bathroom.
是 我不小心滑倒了 还是在浴室里

320
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,680
Bounced right off the tub.
被浴缸弹起来了

321
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,850
Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of
doing when you don't treat them with respect.
对 现在他知道了 如果他不尊重浴缸的话
浴缸会给他好看的

322
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,800
Yeah.

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,190
They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.
趁你闭眼时就给你一拳

324
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,320
So what do you think, Howard?

It's not that bad, right?
也不算很烂 对吧?

Oh, no. A little electrical tape,
some solder... Are you insane?
噢 不算 用点电线包布
一些焊剂... 你是疯了还是怎样?!

327
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:14,140
I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.
太空探测器坠毁在沙漠都比这死相好看

You're right. Monte's gone.

A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

Sheldon, honey, aren't you
getting a little carried away?

你是不是有点走火入魔了?

332
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,010
I mean, it's just a toy robot.
我是说 这不就是个机器人嘛

Just a toy robot?
