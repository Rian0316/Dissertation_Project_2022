1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,765
我和我的兄弟姊妹是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
KLAUS: My siblings and I
are the first vampires in all of history.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,974
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,272
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
Three hundred years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,208
现在我们回来
发现这座城市有了新的王
Now we have returned
to find the city has a new king,

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,849
在一个强大女孩的帮助下统治着城市
one who rules with the aid
of a powerful girl.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,611
他们俘掳了我哥哥以利亚
They have taken possession
of my brother Elijah.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,277
女巫们很想要那个女孩
A coven of witches
want this girl for themselves.

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,945
她们力图得到我的帮助
The seek to enlist my help,

9
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,555
利用我未出生的孩子做筹码
using my unborn child
as leverage,

10
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,956
但我怀疑她们别有用心
though I suspect they have
ulterior motives.

11
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,627
所以我制定了自己的计划
So, I've made a plan
of my own.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,365
我将救出我哥哥
并将这座城市重新收回我家族手中
I will free my brother and
reclaim the city for our family.

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,172
那时我将成为王
Then I will be king.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,982
在我的一生当中
KLAUS:
Over the course of my life,

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,713
我遇到的人里
I've encountered no shortage
of those who would presume

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,483
不乏擅自判定善恶的
to speak of good and evil.

17
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,324
这样的说法根本毫无意义
Such terms mean nothing.

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,896
人们会做对自己最有利的事
People do what is
in their best interest,

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,562
不顾会因此受伤的人
regardless of who gets hurt.

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,844
得到自己想要的，满足欲望
Is it evil to take
what one wants,

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,106
即使这么做会让他人蒙受痛苦
to satisfy hunger
even if doing so

22
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,182
这样邪恶吗？
will cause another's suffering?

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,250
人们所说的邪恶
What some would call evil

24
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,512
我认为是对残酷不公的世界
I believe to be
an appropriate response

25
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,021
的合理反应
to a harsh and unfair world.

26
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,682
无意冒犯，但我不确定我知道
No offense,
but I'm not sure I follow

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,090
你为何邀我来这里
why you've
invited me here.

28
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,992
因为我喜欢你的陪伴
Because I enjoy your company,

29
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,826
我感觉你能够理解
and I sense you have
the capacity

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
像我这样复杂的人
for understanding
someone of my complexity.

31
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,098
你知道我回纽奥良
You see, I returned
to New Orleans

32
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,037
是为了调查一个针对我的威胁
to investigate a threat
posed against me.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,201
结果却发现有个年轻女人
What I found was
a young woman,

34
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,812
怀孕了，需要保护
pregnant,
in need of protection.

35
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,380
我哥哥，总是做好事的那个
My brother,
always the do-gooder,

36
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,881
试图操控我帮助她
tried to manipulate me
into helping her.

37
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,485
他觉得这也许能让我得到救赎
He thought it might redeem me.

38
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,382
问题是，我后来得知
Trouble is,
I've since learned

39
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,286
还有个年轻女人
确切说是女孩
of another young women,
a girl really,

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,950
一个拥有巨大潜力的女孩
one with vast potential,

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,461
被一个暴君所囚禁
held in captivity by a tyrant.

42
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,000
我想要帮助这两个女人
I want to help both of these women.

43
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,229
保护一个，解救另一个
Protect one and free the other.

44
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,238
所以告诉我，卡蜜
So tell me, Cami.

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,310
你觉得这邪恶吗？
Does that sound evil to you?

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,879
我不觉得邪恶是绝对的
I don't believe in
evil as a diagnosis.

47
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,983
我觉得你的人际关系非常不稳定
I think you have unstable
personal relationships,

48
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,143
还有受压力影响的妄想症
stress-related paranoia,

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,311
长期的愤怒管理问题，害怕被抛弃
chronic anger issues,
fear of abandonment.

50
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,983
我觉得你和专业人士聊聊也许会有帮助
I think you could benefit from
talking to someone professionally.

51
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,593
我觉得我更喜欢和你聊
I think I prefer to talk to you.

52
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,601
所以我打算提供一份工作给你
So I'm going to offer you a job

53
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,829
做我的速记员
as my stenographer.

54
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,837
好啊，要写什么？
Okay.
What are we writing?

55
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,499
当然是我的回忆录
My memoirs of course.

56
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,668
我的故事应该被人所知
Someone should
know my story,

57
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,279
这也会让我们有时间讨论
and it will give us time
to discuss

58
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,176
其他有趣的话题
other riveting subjects,

59
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,840
比如你师气的追求者马赛尔
Iike your handsome suitor Marcel.

60
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,680
抱歉，我的私生活…
Excuse me.
My private life is--

61
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,015
你的私生活，事实证明
Your private life is,
as it turns out,

62
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,021
对我的计划至关重要
essential to my plans.

63
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,626
马赛尔想要得到你
You see, Marcel wants you,

64
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,421
正因如此，他会信任你
and because of that,
he will trust you,

65
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,461
这点对我很有利
which serves me.

66
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,796
最重要的是，法语区
The thing is
the French Quarter

67
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,799
的战争一触即发
is on the verge of war.

68
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,030
一方是我
On the one side, there's me,

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,640
另一方是马赛尔
and on the other, Marcel,

70
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:33,268
还有那个法力无边的女巫
以及一支吸血鬼部队
along with a very powerful witch
and an army of vampires.

71
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,606
什么？
What?

72
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,713
你害怕了
You're frightened.

73
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,882
别害怕
Don't be.

74
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,189
我不害怕了
I'm not scared anymore.

75
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,754
太神奇了，你是怎么做到…
That's amazing.
How did you--

76
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,399
这叫魅惑
It's called compulsion.

77
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,057
这算是吸血鬼的小手段
It's a neat bit of vampire trickery.

78
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,261
我会全都告诉你的
I'll tell you all about it,

79
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,876
但首先，我们来多聊聊马赛尔吧
but first, let's talk
a little more about Marcel.

80
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,308
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：纽奥良女孩

81
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,576
这泥蛋复原能力还真强
MARCEL: Sucker's resilient.

82
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,811
他就像穿着西装的蟑螂
He's like a cockroach
in a suit.

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,014
没关系
该把老家伙以利亚还给克劳斯了
Doesn't matter. Time to give
old Elijah back to Klaus anyway.

84
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,489
你要我弄清楚怎样才能杀死真祖
主演：约瑟夫摩根
You asked me to figure out
how to kill the Originals.

85
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,918
我还没弄清楚呢
I'm not done.

86
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,586
银匕首能够伤害他们，但仅此而已
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Silver dagger hurts them,
but that's it.

87
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,697
黛维娜，我们讨论过了
Davina, we've been through this.

88
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,391
克劳斯救了我的命，我欠他一个人情
主演：克莱儿荷特
Klaus saved my life.
I owe him one.

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,360
既然他想要回他哥哥…
Since he wants his brother back--

90
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,132
今晚是一年一度的多芬街音乐节
Tonight's the annual
Dauphine Street Music Festival.

91
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,297
我想去
I want to go.

92
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,103
求求你
Please.

93
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,371
你之所以要待在这里
主演：菲比托金
The whole point of you
being up here

94
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,036
就是为了永远不会在外面被人发现
is so you're never spotted out there.

95
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,139
你知道谁在多芬街讨生活
You know who works smack in
the middle of Dauphine street.

96
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,511
苏菲德弗罗
Sophie Deveraux,

97
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,677
最难搞的女巫
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
pain-in-the-ass witch,

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,118
你也知道如果女巫们找到你
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
and you know what the witches
will do to you 

99
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:48,882
会对你做些什么
if they find you.

100
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,386
但你控制着这些女巫
But you control the witches.

101
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,716
让她走开就是了
Make her go away.

102
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,153
马赛尔，就一晚
Marcel, it's one night.

103
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,953
我说了不行
I said no.

104
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,026
我对你言听计从
I do anything you say,

105
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,497
但有时我觉得你忘记我的能耐了
but sometimes,
I think you forget what I'm capable of.

106
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,834
你知道我能让一个人的血沸腾吗？
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
Did you know I can make
someone's blood boil?

107
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,965
我只要集中精神
All I have to do is focus.

108
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,640
主演：莉雅派普斯
(HlSSlNG, FlzzLlNG)

109
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,686
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,153
好吧，我们各让一步，好吗？
Fine.
We compromise, all right?

111
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,265
你一个人出去太危险了
You going out, alone,
too dangerous,

112
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,765
但我会把你介绍给一位
也要去那的朋友
but I'll introduce you to a friend
of mine that's gonna be there.

113
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,527
好吗？很不错的小姐
All right?
Nice lady.

114
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,695
你们俩会很合得来的
You two are really gonna hit it off.

115
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,504
你好，卡蜜
Hello, Cami.

116
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,284
为什么你一接近我
How is it that when
you come up to me now

117
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,682
周围又没人的时候
and no one else is around

118
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,914
我突然就想起来你刚告诉过我
I suddenly remember
that you just told me

119
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,525
你是个吸血鬼，你对我使用精神控制
you're a vampire and
you're mind-controlling me.

120
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,354
而你一离开，我就会只想着
And then you leave,
and I go back to thinking

121
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,462
你是个性感的男人
you're just some hot guy

122
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,756
口音很迷人，而且挥金如土
with a cute accent and money to burn

123
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,627
写什么乱七八糟的回忆录？
on your sprawling memoir?

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,961
魅惑就是这样，亲爱的
制片：兰斯安德森
Well, that's how
compulsion works, love.

125
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,626
是啊，但这是怎么回事？
Yeah, but what's happening?

126
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,068
这是催眠吗？我的神经元被关闭了吗？
Is it hypnosis, are my neurons
being shut down somehow?

127
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,071
你总是个好奇的学者
You're always the curious scholar.

128
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,740
我们来聊聊马赛尔吧
Let's talk about Marcel.

129
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,812
你说你有点消息要告诉我
You said you have
a little information for me.

130
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,451
他今晚要带一个人去音乐节
He's bringing someone
to the music festival tonight,

131
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,916
他指导的一个女孩
a girl he's mentoring.

132
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,554
显然她正在经历艰难的时刻
Apparently she's going
through a hard time,

133
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,212
反抗权威、愤怒管理问题
rebelling against authority,
anger issues,

134
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,551
之类的
that sort of thing.

135
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,817
我猜因为我有心理学学位
I guess with my
psych degree

136
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:34,960
他觉得我能帮助她步入正途
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
he figured I could set her straight,

137
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,653
但我拒绝了
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
but I said no.

138
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,754
我要坚持请你
I'm gonna go ahead
and insist

139
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,455
改变回答，答应他
you change
your answer to yes.

140
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,730
你要强迫我这么做，是吗？
You're gonna force me
to do this, aren't you?

141
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,035
那干嘛还这么客气呢？
Why even bother with politeness?

142
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,839
因为我喜欢你
Because I like you.

143
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,316
我喜欢你的思考方式
I like the way your mind works.

144
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,014
要是换个情况
Under different circumstances,

145
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,586
我想我们也许会成为朋友
I think we might be friends.

146
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,790
然而
However, 

147
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,725
我不能错过
编剧：蜜雪儿佩洛戴斯，麦克纳度奇
I don't have the luxury

148
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,794
今晚的绝佳机会
of passing up
tonight's opportunity.

149
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,133
除了是马赛尔的强大秘密武器之外
导演：杰西瓦恩
You see, in addition to being Marcel's
rather potent secret weapon,

150
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,737
这个女孩黛维娜还俘掳着我哥哥
this girl Davina
is holding my brother captive.

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,006
换句话说
In other words,

152
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,144
这个女孩需要你的帮助
the girl needs your help.

153
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,801
打电话给马赛尔
Call Marcel,

154
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,880
告诉他你很乐意帮忙
tell him you'll be happy to oblige.

155
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,546
我说过了，爱格妮丝，我感觉很好
I told you, Agnes,
I feel great.

156
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,211
你错过了健康检查
You are overdue for a checkup.

157
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,791
那我要怎么做
匆匆跑进法语区做个快速超音波吗？
What am I gonna do, pop into
the Quarter for a quick ultrasound?

158
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,656
一个在女巫陪同下的狼人孕妇？
A pregnant werewolf
escorted by a witch?

159
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,127
绝对没什么可看的
Nothing to see here.

160
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,061
有许多女人非常渴望怀上孩子
A lot of women
would kill to have a child.

161
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,031
我觉得很奇怪
你都没好好照顾你的孩子
Strikes me as odd that
you're not taking better care of yours.

162
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,298
我认识一个在河口偏僻地方的医生
I know a doctor out in the bayou,
off the beaten path.

163
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,637
我擅自做主替你预约了
Now, I took the liberty
of making an appointment

164
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,406
今晚下班后的时间，只有我们
for you tonight.
After hours, just us.

165
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,550
吸血鬼不会得到消息的
Vampires will never
get word of it.

166
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,684
好，就这样吧
Okay. Fine.

167
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,984
就河口的小儿科医生了
Bayou baby doctor it is.

168
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,155
拜托，妹妹
告诉我你不会还在
Please, sister,
tell me you're not still at it

169
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,425
网上搜寻吧
with the lnternet search.

170
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,034
不过这到底要怎么搜
How does one begin anyway,

171
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,931
输入“无名阁楼”吗？
just type in "anonymous attic"?

172
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,196
总得有人找到以利亚
Someone has to find Elijah,

173
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,273
即使我得搜遍纽奥良每一个该死的阁楼
even if I have to search
every bloody attic in New Orleans.

174
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,431
这就像是在
Like looking for a needle

175
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,510
大海捞针啊
in a rather large pile of needles.

176
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,103
我记得马赛尔带我去的那个阁楼的细节
I remember details about
the attic Marcel took me to.

177
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,942
以利亚棺材后面的窗户上
There were shutters
on the windows

178
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,242
有百叶窗
behind Elijah's coffin.

179
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,510
这样范围就缩小很多了
Well, that should
narrow it down immensely.

180
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,881
我个人而言，比起麻木的脑力劳动
Myself, I prefer actual strategy

181
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,046
更喜欢实际的策略
as opposed to mind-numbing labor.

182
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,089
马赛尔迟迟不归还我们的哥哥
Marcel's delay
in returning our brother

183
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,128
让我怀疑他不再掌控着整个局面
makes me suspect he's no longer
in charge of the situation.

184
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,289
如果黛维娜对马赛尔的忠诚紧张起来
If Davina's loyalty to Marcel is strained,

185
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,196
也许这个年轻女巫将会愿意
perhaps the young witch
will be open to 

186
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,803
接受新的盟友
discussing a new alliance.

187
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,132
一如既往，你对权力的争夺比救回
As usual, your power grabs
are more important

188
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,934
你哥哥还要重要
than rescuing your brother.

189
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,806
我倒觉得这是一石二鸟之计
I prefer to think of it as killing
two birds with one stone.

190
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,174
抢走马赛尔的秘密武器
Rob Marcel of his secret weapon...

191
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,876
把我们的哥哥带回家
...bring our brother home.

192
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,521
嘿，迪亚哥
Hey, Diego.

193
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,493
好吧，有没有能得到
Right. So... any way to fast track

194
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,500
日光戒指的捷径呢？
the whole getting a daylight ring thing?

195
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,161
当你被邀请进入亲信圈的时候
就能得到日光戒指
You get a daylight right when you
get invited to the inner circle.

196
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,069
你嘛，大概永远都不可能了
For you, it may never happen.

197
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,834
但还是有机会的，对吧？
Yeah, but there's an opening, right?

198
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,672
既然提艾里已经…你懂的
I mean, now that Thierry's, like,
you know--

199
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,404
不许再提提艾里，明白吗？
You shut up about Thierry,
all right?

200
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,844
他不该得到这样的下场
He didn't deserve what he got.

201
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,416
马赛尔只是在向克劳斯炫耀
Marcel was just showing off for Klaus.

202
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,453
真等不及让这个老不死的滚出这里
(DOOR OPENS)
Can't wait till his
ancient ass is out of here.

203
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,590
你和我想的一样
You and me both.

204
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,746
注意点，各位
这里来了一位
Look alive, boys.
We got ourselves

205
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,621
高贵的吸血鬼真祖
one high-class Original vampire.

206
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,921
小嘴真甜
A real charmer.

207
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,757
要是我告诉你我能帮你解决
What if I told you that
I could help you out

208
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,523
克劳斯的问题
with your Klaus problem in exchange

209
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,964
换取一点点小八卦怎么样？
for the tiniest bit of gossip?

210
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,297
比如？
Like what?

211
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,995
你应该听说过我和马赛尔
You might have heard the rumors
that Marcel and l

212
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,130
过去的风流韵事
were quite the item back in the day.

213
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,365
他似乎移情别恋了
He seems to have moved on,

214
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,534
而我想知道是和谁
and I would like to know with whom.

215
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,373
你看到他和那个酒保了
You've seen him with the bartender.

216
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,015
他调情的那个普通女孩吗？
What, that plain Jane
that he carries on with?

217
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,845
只有瞎了眼的男人才会选她而不选我
Well, only a blind man
would choose her over me.

218
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,010
他的后宫里一定还有另一个女孩
There must be another girl in his harem.

219
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,722
听着，我只想要一个真正的结束
Look. I just need the
tiniest bit of closure,

220
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,155
然后我就可以离开纽奥良
and then I can leave
New Orleans,

221
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,125
我会保证带着克劳斯一起走
and I'll be sure to take Klaus with me,

222
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,630
这样的话，承认吧
这会让你的生活轻松许多
which, let's face it,
would make your life a whole lot easier.

223
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,660
听着，马赛尔事情非常多
Look.
Marcel's got a full plate.

224
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,999
如果他有在跟其他女人约会
If he's seeing some other honey,

225
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,470
她就一定在法语区
she's somewhere in the Quarter.

226
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,667
可能就在附近
She's probably close by.

227
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,976
小姐，我只知道这些
And that, my lady, is all I got.

228
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,910
（第22届多芬街音乐节）

229
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,361
今晚可是大活动，有许多人会喝酒
Big event tonight,
a lot of people drinking,

230
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,587
有许多眼睛看着
a lot of eyes watching.

231
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,924
我不想要有麻烦
I don't want any trouble,

232
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,326
也就是说不能有女巫
which means no witches.

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,592
去跟女巫们传个话
Send word through the Cauldron.

234
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,429
只要有女巫来，我们就杀掉
Any witches come here, we kill them.

235
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,934
说到这里，也不能有真祖
And while we're at it, no Originals.

236
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,029
我不喜欢蕾贝卡到处打探
I don't like how Rebekah's
been snooping around.

237
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,438
我邀请了卡蜜一起来
她还有她的一位朋友
I got my girl Cami coming,
her and a little friend of hers.

238
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,338
我希望随时有人盯着她们
I want eyes on them at all times.

239
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,206
只能盯着，明白吗？
Eyes only, all right?

240
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,143
我不希望有任何人靠近她们
I don't want anybody going
anywhere near either of them.

241
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,944
大家都有各自的岗位，所有人都警觉点
Everybody's got a post,
everybody keeps an eye out.

242
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,882
明白吗？
We cool?

243
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,734
这是你期待的吗？
So is it everything you hoped for?

244
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,142
是啊
Yeah!

245
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,942
那么我们该复习一下规矩了
So we should probably
go over the rules.

246
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,478
我不会和任何人说任何事
I won't talk to anyone about anything.

247
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,784
我不会说任何有关女巫或吸血鬼
I won't say anything
about witches or vampires

248
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,790
或真祖或你的事
or Originals or you.

249
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,928
但你说过你不会黏着我的
But you said you weren't gonna hover.

250
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,004
这是医生的办公室？
This is the doctor's office?

251
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,668
佩吉医生就住这么偏远
Dr. Paige is only this far out

252
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,315
因为马赛尔的手下一直恐吓她的病人
because Marcel's men kept
terrorizing her patients.

253
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,510
去吧，她又不会咬你
Go.
She won't bite.

254
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,930
让他们进去，告诉他们下手快点
Send them in now
and tell them to do it quickly.

255
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,089
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

256
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,094
我还担心在化妆舞会上的表现之后
I was worried you thought
I was some hot head

257
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,492
你会以为我是个性急的人呢
after that display
at the masquerade.

258
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,758
我们都有性急的时候
We all have
our hot-headed moments.

259
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,597
总之，在清理前，我没什么事可做了
Anyway, I'm almost done here
until cleanup,

260
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,100
所以我们两个女孩可以一起玩
so the two of us girls
can hang out

261
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,069
如果你需要去聊天或是什么的
if you need to go
schmooze or whatever.

262
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,404
你知道吗，他十分钟前就该离开这了
You know, he was supposed to stop
hovering, like, ten minutes ago.

263
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,739
你懂我说的话了吧，管不住了
You see what I mean?
Authority issues.

264
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,279
我去和市长聊聊
I'll go talk to the mayor.

265
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,609
他倒是知道要如何表现尊重
He actually knows
how to show some respect.

266
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,520
他叫什么名字？
So, what's his name?

267
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,955
拉小提琴的师哥
Hot guy with the fiddle.

268
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,359
提姆
Tim.

269
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,257
我就知道他会来
I knew he'd be here.

270
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,457
他总是在这样的场合演出
He always performs
at these kind of things.

271
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,001
你们俩认识多久了？
How long have you two
known each other?

272
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,535
十岁时就认识了
Since we were ten.

273
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,097
我不得不退学
I had to leave school,

274
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,037
我没有机会道别
and I didn't get to say good-bye,

275
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,701
我只希望今晚能和他说两句话
so I was just hoping
to talk to him tonight.

276
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,477
很好
That's it!

277
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,555
教堂关门了
Church is closed.

278
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,791
你想要我刺激，去鬼屋吧
You want your horror fix,
go take a ghost tour.

279
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,596
我不太喜欢鬼
I don't much care for ghosts.

280
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,295
不过我对百叶窗很着迷
I am, however,
fascinated by window shutters.

281
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,771
我一整天都在城里观赏百叶窗
I've been on a town tour
of them all day.

282
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,400
我注意到你阁楼的窗户上有百叶窗
I noticed the windows
of your attic have shutters.

283
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,972
你真的是对百叶窗感兴趣吗？
Are you really interested in shutters?

284
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,880
我向你保证这是我现在最着迷的东西
I can assure
it's my current life obsession.

285
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,111
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

286
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,279
基兰神父，你呢？
Father Kieran, and you are?

287
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,948
小好奇小姐
Mildly curious.

288
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,094
这里发生了什么事？
What happened here?

289
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,323
圣安妮教堂曾是这一带的中心
St. Anne's used to be
the heart of the neighborhood.

290
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,163
自从那晚大屠杀之后
It's been abandoned
for a while now.

291
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,497
已经被废弃了一阵子了
Since the night of the massacre.

292
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,343
九名神学生被他们的一个同学杀死
Nine seminary students were killed
by one of their own.

293
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,606
不！
No!

294
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,151
你就站在血迹之上
You're standing on blood.

295
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,256
我没那么容易吐
I'm not squeamish.

296
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,413
阁楼在哪？
Where's the attic?

297
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,493
我刚才说了，教堂关门了
Like I said, the church is closed.

298
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,656
阁楼在哪？
Where is the attic?

299
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,257
圣器室后面的楼梯上面
Past the sacristy.
Up the stairs.

300
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,870
谢谢你
现在忘了我曾经来过这里
Thank you.
Now, forget I was here.

301
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,079
我就知道
I knew it.

302
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,359
搞什么鬼？
What the bloody hell?

303
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,998
蕾贝卡，请注意错辞
Rebekah, language, please.

304
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,827
以利亚
Elijah!

305
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,301
这些是什么？
What is all this?

306
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,532
你不记得了吗？
You don't remember?

307
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,837
你和我一起去了歌剧院
You and l
went to the opera house together.

308
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,139
那是克劳斯拔出你身上的匕首之后
It was your first foray
back into New Orleans society

309
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,748
你回到纽奥良的第一次劫掠
after Klaus removed the dagger from you.

310
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,044
这是只有你我共享的回忆
It's a memory that
only you and I share.

311
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,313
同时我还要让你知道
这不是黛维娜的另一个花招
Also I needed to know
it's not another of Davina's tricks.

312
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,650
你怎么会醒着？
Well, how are you even awake?

313
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,814
黛维娜拔出了匕首
Davina withdrew the dagger,

314
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,257
她不知道这么做哪怕只有一次
也会让它失去作用
unaware that doing so even once
would negate its power.

315
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,558
再过几小时，我就会复原了
In a few hours,
I shall be as good as new.

316
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,892
那让我回阁楼去
So, put me back into the attic,

317
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,226
我们就能想办法把你弄出去
and we can find a way
to get you out.

318
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,766
恐怕我还没有准备好
I'm afraid I'm not quite ready

319
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,563
离开呢，蕾贝卡
to leave yet, Rebekah.

320
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,571
这个女孩黛维娜，她很好奇
This girl, Davina, she's curious.

321
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,504
也很任性
Willful, too.

322
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,099
很快我就能和她聊聊了
Soon I shall be able
to speak to her,

323
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,269
也许还能提议某种形式的休战
perhaps even to propose
a truce of some kind.

324
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,243
如果我们能终止这场
So, if we can end this war

325
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,076
吸血鬼和女巫的战争
between the vampires and the witches,

326
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,547
我们就能清除
we'll be able to eliminate the threat

327
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,345
海莉和她孩子的威胁了
to Hayley and her baby.

328
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,251
也许那时，尼克劳斯和我们家族
Perhaps then Niklaus
and our entire family

329
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,947
终于能够享受安宁了
can finally know peace.

330
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,356
在此期间，我需要你照顾好海莉
In the meantime,
I need you to look after Hayley.

331
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,428
她现在是我们的家人了
She is our family now.

332
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,292
所以我需要她和她未出生的孩子
So, I need her
and her unborn child

333
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,456
能够受到我们的保护
to fall underneath our protection.

334
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,068
对我发誓，蕾贝卡
Swear to me, Rebekah.

335
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,800
我发誓
I swear.

336
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,106
你的宝宝的心率很正常
Your baby's heart rate is perfect.

337
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,408
我就知道，她和她妈妈一样坚强
I knew it.
She's a tough one like her mom.

338
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,622
那是很特别的胎记啊
That's a unique birthmark.

339
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,487
我们差不多可以了吧？
We're pretty much done here, right?

340
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,190
（蕾贝卡：你在哪？）

341
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,720
你的血压有点高
Your blood pressure's a bit high.

342
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,426
我帮你准备了一点药
I've got something for it.

343
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:55,996
（在河口诊所看医生）

344
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,323
那个…其实我不太喜欢吃药
Ah, you know,
I'm actually not that good with pills.

345
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,660
说实话，我也是
Well, me neither, truth be told.

346
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,808
你好，提姆
KLAUS: Hello, Tim.

347
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,205
我相信你和我都认识一个人
I believe you and l
share an acquaintance.

348
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,751
做个好孩子，帮我传话给她
Be a good lad and help me
send her a message.

349
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,488
他不可能走远的
Well, he couldn't have gone far.

350
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,755
他一分钟前才离开舞台
He just got offstage a minute ago.

351
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,057
没关系，反正这是个愚蠢的主意
It doesn't matter.
This was a stupid idea anyway.

352
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,699
不，不是的，黛维娜…
No, it wasn't.
Davina.

353
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,334
算了吧
Just forget it.

354
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,903
告诉她这是一个乐手给的
Tell her this is
from one of the musicians.

355
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,300
她会想离开
She'll want to leave,

356
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,908
她要带她从后门溜走
and you're going to help her
slip out the back exit

357
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,873
这样马赛尔就看不到了
so Marcel doesn't see.

358
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,069
不管你做什么
Whatever you do,

359
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,044
不要让她离开你的视线
don't let her out of your sight.

360
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,552
等一下，黛维娜
Wait, Davina!

361
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,826
我做不到
I can't do this.

362
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,800
你好
Hey.

363
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,267
提姆，我收到你的纸条了
Tim, I got your note.

364
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,775
我收到你的简讯了
I got your text message.

365
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,243
谢谢你来这里见我
Thanks for meeting me here.

366
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,175
能见到你真是太好了
It's so amazing to see you.

367
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,183
真不敢相信我现在居然站在这里
I can't even believe
I'm standing here right now.

368
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,185
我…
I just....

369
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,589
哇
Wow!

370
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,351
你去哪了？
So where have you been,

371
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,189
为什么想在这里见面？
and why did you want to meet here?

372
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,024
这里好阴森
It's so creepy,

373
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,825
发生过很多可怕的事
all the terrible stuff
that happened.

374
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,764
我也说不清，我还蛮喜欢这里的
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

375
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,199
这里很安静
You know, it's quiet.

376
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,770
一个地方不能因为发生了一件糟糕的事
I mean, the place can't
be bad for all time

377
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,635
就一直糟糕下去，对吧？
just because one bad thing
happened, right?

378
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,437
等等，不是，还是从头说起吧
Wait. No. All right.
Back up.

379
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,638
那天你突然就不来学校了
To where one day,
you just stop coming to school,

380
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,215
从此你就像蒸发了一样
and then it's like you just vanished.

381
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,586
是因为突发情况
我得去处理一些事情
There was an emergency,
and I needed to take care
of some things.

382
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,882
那你没事吧？
Are you okay?

383
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,614
你看起来没事
I mean, you look okay.

384
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,452
事实上，你看起来非常好
You look great, actually.

385
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,823
那你打算回学校吗？
So are you coming back to school?

386
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,434
不回去了
No.

387
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,640
但我要你知道，即便我离开了
But I need you to know
that even though I was away...

388
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,104
我依然想念你
...I miss you.

389
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,574
我想念能在学校看见你的日子
I miss seeing you at school

390
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,413
想念看你拉小提琴的日子
and seeing you play your violin.

391
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,518
其实
Well....

392
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,492
这地方音响效果还不错
This place does have good acoustics.

393
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,232
这孩子很有天赋
The boy has a gift.

394
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,499
要拉出这种感觉是魅惑不来的
You can't compel someone
to play like that.

395
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,972
我知道你是干什么的
I know what you are.

396
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,138
虽然我觉得很疯狂，但至少能说得通
It's crazy to me,
but at least it makes sense,

397
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:36,481
但这场杀戮
完全是残忍而没有意义的
but this massacre
was just a pointless, brutal thing.

398
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,748
你一生中，有听说过
In all your life,
have you ever heard

399
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,357
这样的事吗
of anything like that,

400
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,723
一个好人，一个有理想的牧师
a good man,
an aspiring priest,

401
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,863
没有缘由地掀起一场杀戮
just goes on a killing spree
out of nowhere.

402
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,993
我一生中见太多了
I've seen quite a lot in my time.

403
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,833
这个世界非常可怕
The world is a rather awful place.

404
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,271
最好得去适应它的规则
Best to meet it on its own terms.

405
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,904
不，这个世界并不可怕
No.
The world isn't awful.

406
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,571
人也不可怕
People are not awful.

407
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,342
他们是向善的
They want to be good.

408
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,418
是一些事让他们变坏
Something makes them bad.

409
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,350
把他们击倒
Something breaks them down,

410
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,353
让他们突然崩溃
makes them snap.

411
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,585
总会有迹象
There are always signs,

412
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,560
一个人精神崩溃之前一定有征兆
symptoms before someone
has a psychotic break.

413
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,097
但这凶手完全没有出现任何征兆
The guy who did this had none of them.

414
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,098
他不酗酒，不吸毒
He didn't drink,
he didn't do drugs.

415
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,033
你对这件事很了解啊
You're well-informed on the matter.

416
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,601
你认识他，是吗？
You knew him, didn't you?

417
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,144
他叫西恩
His name was Sean.

418
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,784
是我哥哥
He was my brother.

419
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,147
实际上是我的双胞胎哥哥
My twin actually.

420
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,286
我无法入眠
I can't sleep.

421
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,226
不停地梦见发生的一切
I dream about what happened...

422
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,726
我恨这种感觉
...and I hate it.

423
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
我恨自己不能帮他
I hate that I couldn't help him.

424
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,699
我们都要独自面对自己内心的恶魔
We all must stand alone
against our demons.

425
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,003
要是有一天这些恶魔
也在我心中滋生呢？
What if someday his demons
become mine too?

426
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,239
我有些事
I have some business

427
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,746
需要去处理
I should attend to

428
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,851
在我去之前
but before I do...

429
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,480
你该走了
You should go.

430
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,954
去欣赏音乐，别再想这些
Enjoy the music,
put this out of your mind.

431
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,360
马赛尔
Marcel.

432
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,602
基兰神父，欢迎回来
Father Kieran, welcome back.

433
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,036
我没想到你会回来
I wasn't sure when
you'd be coming home.

434
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,198
看得出来
I can tell,

435
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,972
看看我教堂阁楼里
发生了什么事就知道了
judging by what's going on
in my church attic.

436
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,674
我觉得你不会介意的
I didn't think you'd mind.

437
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,181
上帝为证，我帮过你一两个小忙
Lord knows,
I'd done you a favor or two.

438
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,876
我猜你已经知道真祖回来了
I take it you know
the Originals have returned.

439
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,623
那个妹妹蕾贝卡，我刚才看到她
The sister Rebekah,
I saw her earlier,

440
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,556
在教堂四处窥探，打听阁楼的事
snooping around the church,
asking about the attic.

441
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,289
她不知道我体内有马鞭草
She doesn't know I take vervain.

442
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,432
你有问题要处理了
You got a problem on your hands.

443
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,625
我对你和你教堂的哀悼方式
No disrespect for
the grieving process,

444
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,962
并无不敬之意
for you and your church,

445
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,967
但我想知道，你是来帮我的
but just so I know,
are you here to help,

446
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,572
还是专程来批评我的？
or are you just gonna drop in
with criticism?

447
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,975
永远记住，马赛尔
Never forget, Marcel,

448
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,204
你能在这个城市安身都是
that you live
in this city by the grace

449
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,349
拜那些知道你秘密
of those that know your secret

450
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,451
并容忍你的人们所赐
and tolerate you.

451
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,953
这个城市之所以繁荣是因为我
And this city thrives
because of me

452
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,350
和我的手下
and my people.

453
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,718
如果哪天你忘记这点了
Anytime you need a reminder of that,

454
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,223
让我来提醒你
just let me know.

455
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,762
马赛尔，迪亚哥说他跟丢了那两个女孩
Marcel, Diego said
he lost eyes on the girls.

456
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,060
回头接着聊
To be continued.

457
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,373
你们俩真的是太可爱了
You two are absolutely adorable.

458
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,207
我真的很感动，真的
It warms my heart,
it really does,

459
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,042
但我现在要和这位小姐说两句
but I do need a word
with the young lady.

460
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,652
所以，提姆，去一边坐下
So, Tim, go sit down,

461
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,878
数到十万
count to 100,000.

462
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,151
小点声，真乖
Quietly now.
There's a good boy.

463
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,420
我猜你知道我是谁
I assume you know who I am.

464
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,497
那我们就废话少说了，好吗？
Then let's get right to it,
shall we?

465
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,433
你现在的困境在我看来
就是交友不慎的绝佳案例啊
Your current dilemma strikes me
as a case of poor alliances.

466
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,269
你忠于马赛尔
You're loyal to Marcel,

467
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,368
而他却把你藏在阁楼里
and yet he keeps you
tucked away in an attic.

468
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,882
你一定更希望多点自由
Surely you'd prefer
just a little bit more freedom,

469
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,178
而马赛尔却把你关起来
and yet Marcel keeps you prisoner.

470
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,844
马赛尔并不是把我关起来
Marcel doesn't keep me prisoner.

471
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,580
他是在保护我
He keeps me safe.

472
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,713
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

473
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,850
这一点母庸置疑
Well, I have no doubt he is,

474
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,760
但对于一个被卷入
女巫和吸血鬼战争的女孩来说
but for a girl caught in a war
between the witches and the vampires,

475
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,457
我也许可以做个更称职的朋友
I might be a better friend.

476
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,262
我会保护你
I would keep you safe,

477
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,532
同时给你自由
and I'd allow you your freedom.

478
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,270
如果马赛尔能做到这点
If Marcel could do that,

479
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,141
为什么他到现在还不做？
why hasn't he done so already?

480
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,215
而且有个问题你无法回避
And it does beg the question,

481
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,477
如果马赛尔连你都保护不了
if Marcel can't protect you,

482
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,553
那这些你所关心的人又怎么办呢？
then what of those you care about?

483
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,714
如果任何人想要伤害我关心的人
If anyone tries to hurt
anyone I care about,

484
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,880
我会杀了他们
I'll kill them.

485
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,321
好吧
Well, then,

486
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,952
听起来你根本就不需要马赛尔
sounds like you don't need Marcel at all.

487
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,964
也许你早就怀疑了
Perhaps you've suspected it all along.

488
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,796
你的挚友马赛尔骗你
Your dear friend Marcel tricks you

489
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,562
为他做事
into doing his bidding,

490
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,903
一直以来，你独自在阁楼上自生自灭
and all the while,
you rot in an attic alone...

491
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,342
而小提摩西却已开始了新的生活
...while young Timothy
moves on with his life.

492
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,449
你感觉到了吗？
You feel that?
(HlSSlNG, FlzzLlNG)

493
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,408
那是你的血液开始沸腾
That's your blood starting to boil.

494
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,358
真可惜你才与他重聚
Such a shame to lose him

495
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,995
却马上又要失去他
just as you found him again.

496
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,496
我真的很欣赏你的琴艺
And I really did admire
your skill with that violin.

497
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,259
不准伤害他
Don't you dare hurt him!

498
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,097
我也希望不用到那一步，亲爱的
Well, I hope I won't have to, sweetheart,

499
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,761
但这都要看你了
but then that depends on you.

500
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,476
（警戒线 严禁穿越）

501
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,439
马上放开他
Let him go now!

502
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,483
你该知道我最不喜欢人家指使我
You should know
I don't do well with demands.

503
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,615
厉害，但你不会想与我作对的，亲爱的
Impressive,
but you don't want to fight me, love.

504
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,251
无辜的人总是沦为牺牲品
Innocent people have a way
of winding up dead.

505
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,623
求求你放了我
Please let me go.

506
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,526
决定权在你，小女巫
Your choice, little witch.

507
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,963
宣誓只效忠我一人，这男孩就能活下去
Swear allegiance to me alone,
and the boy lives.

508
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,061
如果与我作对…
Stand against me....

509
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,850
不得不说我对你刮目相看了
I have to say I'm impressed.

510
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,319
你怎么找到我的？
How'd you find me?

511
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,925
你的简讯给了我提示
剩下的多亏了吸血鬼听力
Your text got me halfway.
Vamp hearing did the rest.

512
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,082
他们是谁？
Who are they?

513
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,889
女巫，术士，我也不知道
Witches, warlocks,
whatever.

514
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,359
他们还有同伴
There are more of them.

515
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,528
快跑
Run!

516
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,729
我的家人就不能
If I had a dollar for every mess

517
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,067
少给我惹点事吗？
my family's gotten me into.

518
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,405
蕾贝卡
Rebekah!

519
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,549
她在哪？黛维娜在哪？
Where is she?
Where's Davina?

520
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,252
她去圣安妮教堂见一个男孩了
She went to meet a boy
in St. Anne's church.

521
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,920
你在这待着以防她回来
Stay here in case she comes back.

522
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,147
怎么回事？
What the hell?

523
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,377
海莉？
Hayley?

524
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,516
海莉？
Hayley?

525
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,624
提姆
Tim.

526
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,962
什么叫做她不见了？
What do you mean she's missing?

527
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,267
还能有什么意思？
REBEKAH:
What do you think I mean?

528
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,932
到处都是尸体和血
There's blood and bodies everywhere.

529
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,407
有人在这大开杀戒了
Someone's ripped this lot to shreds,

530
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,412
没看见那个自作聪明的孕妇
and there's no smart-aleck pregnant girl.

531
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,017
继续我，我马上过去
Keep looking.
I'm on my way.

532
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,612
求求你不要伤害我
Please don't hurt me.

533
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,588
我本来也不想这样的
KLAUS:
It wasn't my intent to,

534
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,250
但很遗憾，我没时间装好人了
but sadly,
I've run out of time to play nice.

535
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,674
提姆，不要
Tim?
Oh, no!

536
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,572
不要，求求你
No, please.

537
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,349
我很抱歉，真的很抱歉
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

538
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,816
我不想伤害你的
I didn't mean to hurt you.

539
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,217
战争的悲剧性后果之一
KLAUS: One of the tragic
consequences of war,

540
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,380
就是无辜的旁人受伤
innocent bystanders.

541
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,989
如果小提摩西为你而死
What terrible guilt
you'll have to live with,

542
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,891
你得背负着多大的愧疚过完一生
young Timothy's blood
on your hands.

543
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,053
离他远点
Get away from him!

544
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,223
先别这么急着悲伤
Now, now, let's not be hasty.

545
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,632
毕竟，我可以救他
After all, I can heal him.

546
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,566
只要你…
All you have to do...

547
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,308
求我
...is ask.

548
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,945
求求你
Please.

549
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,580
为了你，黛维娜，乐意之至
For you, Davina, with pleasure.

550
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,871
你不会记得演出后发生的任何事
You will forget everything that
happened after the concert,

551
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:32,608
包括你和黛维娜见面
including the fact
that you saw Davina.

552
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,014
什么？不
What? No.

553
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,710
如果他记得曾见过你
If he remembers
seeing you,

554
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,219
他可能会四处找你
he might come looking.

555
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,447
如果女巫们知道了他的存在
If the witches learn of him,

556
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,648
她们知道你有弱点
if they know you have a weakness,

557
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,793
可怜的提姆很可能会再一次
then poor Tim might end up
as leverage

558
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,829
当作用来控制你的筹码
in an awful scheme
to control you again.

559
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,660
好了，来，起来吧
Okay. Come on.
Up you come.

560
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,636
带着你的小提琴盒
Take your violin case
with you.

561
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,399
你会记得演出后在后台丢了你的乐器
You'll remember losing the instrument
backstage after the performance.

562
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,806
你真应该更小心点的
You really should be more careful.

563
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,738
搞定了
All fixed.

564
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,577
现在你欠我一个人情
Now, you owe me a favor.

565
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,762
黛维娜
MARCEL: Davina.

566
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,666
发生什么事了？
What happened?

567
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,000
你为什么会在这里？
What are you doing here?

568
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,132
我住在这里，记得吗？
I live her, remember?

569
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,283
你居然放弃追逐权力
Wow, you abandoned
your quest for power

570
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,121
来帮助你的家人
to help out your family.

571
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,421
今天休假吗？
Having an off day?

572
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,588
一谁抓走了她，蕾贝卡？
一我不知道
-Who took her, Rebekah?
-I don't know.

573
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,030
什么叫做你不知道？
What do you mean you don't know?

574
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,600
那是谁杀了攻击她的人？
Then who killed her attackers?

575
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,738
我不知道，我胸口插了根箭
I don't know.
I had an arrow in my heart.

576
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,364
如果不是海莉杀了他们，那么…
If it wasn't Hayley
who killed them, then....

577
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,771
真好，说不定她的亲戚们知道她在哪
Lovely. Perhaps her cousins
will know where she is.

578
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,047
海莉，发生什么事了？快告诉我
Hayley, what happened?
Tell me what happened.

579
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,992
我不记得了
I can't remember.

580
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,424
你的伤口完全愈合了
You've completely healed.

581
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,792
你身上一点伤痕都没有
There's not a scratch on you.

582
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,059
身为狼人的好处之一记得吗？
One of the perks
of being a werewolf, remember?

583
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,998
不，不会好得这么快
No.
Not that fast.

584
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,729
别烦她了
Leave her alone.

585
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,666
是因为这个孩子
It's the baby,

586
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,837
她有吸血鬼的血
克劳斯的血在你身体里
the vampire blood,
Klaus' blood in your system.

587
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,675
可以治愈任何伤口
It can heal any wound.

588
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,742
你的孩子治愈了你
Your own child healed you.

589
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,981
你是怎么逃出来的？
How did you escape?

590
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,489
你寡不敌众还徒手搏斗
You were outnumbered, unarmed.

591
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,922
那些人都被撕成碎片了
Those men were ripped to shreds.

592
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,324
我想是那只狼
I think it was the wolf.

593
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,125
我想他在试图保护我
I think it's trying to protect me.

594
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,428
那些女巫本应保护你的
The witches were
supposed to protect you.

595
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,595
等我抓到苏菲德弗罗…
When I get my hands
on Sophie Deveraux--

596
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,103
那不是苏菲
It wasn't Sophie.

597
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,262
是爱格妮丝
It was Agnes.

598
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,035
好吧，爱格妮丝，苏菲
对我来说都一样
Fine. Agnes, Sophie.
It's all the same to me.

599
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,200
我会把她们杀个片甲不留
I'll slaughter the lot of them.

600
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,606
如果以利亚先到就不行了
Not if Elijah gets there first.

601
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,940
以利亚？
Elijah?

602
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,841
你我到他了？
Did you find him?

603
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,508
一直有联系，而且他有个计划
He's been in touch,
and he has a plan.

604
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,518
他只要求我们照顾好你
All he asked is
that we take care of you.

605
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,955
那么，我们可以回家了吗？
Hey.
So, can we go home now?

606
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,864
我真想好好睡上几天
I'd really like to sleep
for a few days.

607
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,169
哇
Whoa!

608
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,971
接住你了，亲爱的，有我呢
I've got you, love.
I've got you.

609
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,688
我说得非常清楚
I was crystal clear.

610
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,450
随时都要盯着她们俩
Eyes on my girls
at all times.

611
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,753
怎么，那女孩的朋友从你的派对上溜走
Well.... Girl's little friend
sneaks away from your party,

612
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,327
是我们的错吗？
and that's our fault?

613
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,227
怎么，马赛尔，你也要把我关起来吗？
What, Marcel, you gonna send
me to the garden now, too?

614
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,605
他醒来后
When he wakes up,

615
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,436
告诉他这样的态度
tell him that an apology
would have gotten him

616
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,271
还不如直接道歉
a lot further than his attitude.

617
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,084
教堂发生的事真是太糟了
Awful what happened
at the church.

618
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,948
我听说他们声称是瓦斯漏气
I hear they're
calling it a gas leak.

619
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,453
真遗憾
Such a pity.

620
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,922
我听说你今天可是任务繁重
I heard that you were quite
the woman on a mission today.

621
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,219
我能说什么？我想要以利亚回来而已
What can I say?
I want Elijah back.

622
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,454
仅此而已吗？
Is that all you want?

623
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,858
我会还给你以利亚
You'll get Elijah back.

624
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,763
同时，离开酒吧
In the meantime,
stay out of this bar

625
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,699
并且和我手下保持距离
and stay away from my guys.

626
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,133
怎么，你吃醋了？
What's wrong?
You jealous?

627
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,399
我？我已经找到我的女王了
Me? I've already found
my queen.

628
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,772
那个酒保卡蜜吗？
Cami, the bartender?

629
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,607
别欺骗自己了，马赛尔
Stop fooling yourself, Marcel.

630
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,146
她只是你的慰藉食物
She's comfort food.

631
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,874
是让你分心
Something to distract you

632
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,541
不知道自己到底想要什么的慰藉食物
from what you really want.

633
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,152
即使过了这么多年
Which, after all these years,

634
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,652
也不能否认
is impossible to deny

635
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,655
因为你想要的就站在你面前
because I'm standing
right in front of you.

636
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,073
克劳斯？
Klaus?

637
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,477
你怎么来了？
What are you doing here?

638
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,107
已经大半夜了
I've had quite a night.

639
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,883
我想到你说过你做噩梦还失眠
I recall you mentioned something
about nightmares and insomnia.

640
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,290
我想我能帮忙，可以进来吗？
I believe I can help.
May I come in?

641
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,728
这真是太奇怪了
进来吧
This is super weird.
Come in.

642
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,896
等等
Wait.

643
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,301
没错，我告诉过你
That's right.
I told you what happened.

644
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,465
我从没和别人提起过，但却告诉了你
I never tell anybody,
but I told you...

645
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,743
你说过西恩独自一人
...and you said something
about Sean

646
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,247
对抗着心中的恶魔
standing alone against his demons.

647
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,646
当他杀了那些人
When he killed those men,

648
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,252
我想他一定是精神不正常了
I thought he must be mentally ill,

649
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,755
但如果都是因为恶魔呢？
but what if it was demons?

650
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,825
如果是吸血鬼魅惑了他呢？
What if a vampire compelled him?

651
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,825
如果是这样
你会奋不顾身
And if so,
would you devote yourself

652
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,294
去找到罪魁祸首吗？
to finding the guilty party?

653
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,799
你会牺牲一切去找到真相吗？
Would you sacrifice everything
to find out the truth?

654
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,597
到底是为什么？
To what end?

655
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,296
为什么？
To what end?

656
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,998
这就是我来纽奥良的原因
This is the entire reason
I'm in New Orleans.

657
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,770
卡蜜，这个谜最终的结局
Cami, whatever lies on the
other end of this mystery

658
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,209
只会给你带来痛苦
will only offer you pain.

659
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,441
什么都不能让你哥哥起死回生
Nothing will bring your brother back.

660
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,486
你得到平静的唯一方法就是忘掉这一切
Your only hope for peace
is to forget this.

661
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,623
一不
一并且向前看
-No.
-And move on.

662
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,224
不，别魅惑我忘记这一切
No.
Don't compel me to forget this.

663
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,485
如果我不抹掉你的记忆
And if I allow you to remember,

664
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,561
这一切会侵蚀着你
the knowledge will eat away at you.

665
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,893
你对真相的追寻只会置你于险境
Your quest for truth
will only put you in danger.

666
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,967
你根本不是在关心我
You don't care about me!

667
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,228
你只是想让我忘记
这样我就能把注意集中在马赛尔身上
You just want me to forget this
so I can be focused on Marcel,

668
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,305
我就会乖乖当你的小间谋
so I'll be a good,
little spy for you.

669
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,567
是的，我需要你的忠诚
I need your loyalty, yes,

670
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,142
这对你来说也许很自私
and, though that
may appear selfish to you,

671
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,041
但我的计划远不只是为了我自己
the scope of my plan
goes far beyond myself.

672
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,945
撇开权力，我试图对我哥哥表示尊重
Power aside,
I am trying to honor my brother.

673
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,487
那我哥哥呢？
What about my brother,

674
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,420
我的双胞胎哥哥？
my twin brother?

675
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,585
我们一生都连结在一起
We were bonded our whole lives,

676
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:29,757
我知道，我知道他不是突然就这样
and I know...
I know he didn't just snap,

677
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,663
我要知道是谁干的
and I need to know who did this,

678
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,430
我希望为他平反
and I need to make this right.

679
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,096
不，不要抹掉我的记忆
No.
Don't take this away from me!

680
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,675
你什么都不会做
You will do nothing.

681
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,779
你哥哥病了
Your bother was ill.

682
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,007
他杀了那些人，然后自杀
He killed those people
and himself,

683
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,673
这是个悲剧
and it was a tragedy.

684
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,715
你能做的就是…
All you can do...

685
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,650
向前看
...is move on.

686
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,429
你知道你哥哥安息了
Know that your brother
is at peace

687
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,369
而且你不用担心
and that you needn't worry.

688
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,533
我会弄清真相
I will find out what happened,

689
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,202
到那时候
and when I do,

690
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,009
不论是谁伤害了你哥哥，我都会让他
I will make sure
whoever harmed your brother...

691
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,645
付出代价
...will suffer.

692
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,814
至于你
And as for you,

693
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,960
今晚，你将入眠
tonight, you will sleep,

694
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:34,496
梦中的世界要比现实好得多
and you will dream of a world
far better than this one.

695
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,770
一个没有邪恶，没有恶魔的世界
Aworld where there is no evil,
no demons...

696
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,305
那是所有人都在追求的
...and all people desire...

697
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,375
是做一个善良的人
...only to be good.

698
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,125
别担心，黛维娜
It's all right, Davina.

699
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,620
我不会伤害你
I don't mean you any harm.

700
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,666
我想我们是时候谈谈了
Though I do think it's time
we had a talk.

701
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,503
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
