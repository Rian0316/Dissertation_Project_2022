- Otis, these guys.

- No, miss, he can't be in our group.
- He's a twat.

It's fine, miss.
It's the least I could do.

Do you mean claustrophobic?

57

Arachnophobic means
you're scared of spiders.

Oh! No, I love spiders.

I'm here to see Dr. O'Dern.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Yes.

I'm Hope.

You must be exhausted.

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes, it is a bit full-on at the minute,
but I like to keep busy.

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,240
How are you enjoying
the transition to Moordale?

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,120
A lot of things needed addressing,
as I'm sure you're aware.

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,160
You deal with some of it in your book.

101
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, you've read it.

102
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
I skimmed.

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
It's an interesting take,

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,920
but we have different perspectives
when it comes to teaching children.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes. I've seen your new SRE curriculum.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,600
It looks a lot like
you're advocating abstinence to me.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,920
It isn't so much about abstinence
as it is about restraint,

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,840
which I think is an important attribute,

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,040
particularly for teenagers
who should be focusing on their education.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Unfortunately, restraint doesn't mix
very well with raging hormones.

111
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,240
I think that's giving teenagers
less credit than they're due.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,640
Sorry. I gave you the wrong form.
This one's for the older mummies.

- Yes.

[Jean] If you're open
to discussing this further,

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,640
I'd be very interested
in telling you more about my perspective.

I'm currently with your ex-girlfriend,

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
and, you know,
you stole Rahim's boyfriend.

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,840
That's what I mean by awkward, you know?

122
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,880
I thought if I said it out loud,
it'd make it less tense, but it didn't.

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,280
I dated Aimee as well.
Should we check out these trenches?

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,920
I, uh, I didn't steal your boyfriend.

- [Steve] Oh yeah?

And a total fuck machine.

- That's so inappropriate.

- No, thanks.

- Okay.
- [Steve] Hey, guys! I found a bunker.

at the student forum?

his fantasy is medieval maidens.

- Hm.
- And he calls his dick a sheath.

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes, and my vagina a lady flower.
Gives me the ick.

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,840
But you like fantasy stuff.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,480
I love me some Dungeons and Dragons
when it's a game, not when I'm DTF.

You might be surprised.

We should. Let's go.

- It's completely inappropriate.
- <i>Oy vey.</i>

395
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,880
It's patriarchy in action, in fact.

- And in a hospital!
- Hey, what's happening?

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,920
I just had the most horrible experience
with a doctor,

399
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
and I am making a formal complaint.

400
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
Sorry. We are upset.

- Let me call my supervisor.

Oh! Ha! That is fantastic.
Yes, ignore the pregnant woman,

406

Don't you tell me

I told you,
I was trying to get us some tea.

- It's human poo.

I think I'm gonna vomit.

421
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,720
[in French] One of your students
threw poo at my car!

422
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,040
Yes. Okay.

423
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,600
[in English] Anyone know what he's saying?
Who speaks French properly?

424

Rahim, please.

425
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Um, he says, "At least no one was hurt."

426
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,640
[in French] Yes.

427
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,240
I saw an arm throw it out of the window.

428
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,440
[in English] And he says that
we should carry on driving now.

429

[in French] It was him.
It was him! He has no sock!

It was him who threw the poo at my car!

[laughs]

432
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,560
[in English] He thinks he knows me.
I don't know you, sir. I'm sorry.

433
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,480
No, you wouldn't know us.
We're from Moordale, England.

434
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,360
I think someone threw it from our coach.

and the window's open.

Did someone throw this poo
from that coach?

439
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,840
- [whispers] What if it was me?
- [Colin] Huh?

440
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,000
- It's not you, Jackson.
- I poo all the time.

441
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
- [Colin] Someone own up, please.
- I'm just a tube.

442
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,160
Did they put it in a sock?

443
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
[Colin] Don't touch it.

444
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,320
It could be evidence.
Jesus Christ. Oh my God!

445
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,040
- [phone ringing]
- Oh good. Hope's calling me. Hope.

446
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
Ignore it, Colin.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,920
[ringing stops]

448
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys think this is funny?

449
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,240
Do you?

450
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you have any idea the kind of pressure
Miss Sands and I are under?

451
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Someone is gonna take responsibility
for this flying feces!

452
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,360
Anyone? No?

453
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay. I didn't wanna have to do this,
but, boys, trousers up.

454
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,600
We're checking socks, mate. Trousers up!

Thank you. Not yours, mate.

465
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,280

- It's my poo.

466
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,800
- I blocked the toilet. I was embarrassed...
- I also poo sometimes.

467

Oh God, don't we all?
What is this, Spartacus?

468
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,640
Maybe it was my poo.
Maybe it's Miss Sands' poo.

469
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,160
- [boy] What?
- She's more than capable.

470
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
We don't have time for that now.

471
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,360
Adam, clean this up.
I don't care how. Okay?

472
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you, Adam Groff,

473
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,800
for owning up to doing this huge poo

474
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,240
and undermining my authority.

475
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,680
Thank you. Cheers, buddy.

476
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,680
Cheers, mate. No. No.

477
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,200
- No. Fuck him. Fuck him.
- Okay, let's all relax. Yeah?

If anyone needs to use the toilets,
they're over here.

to understand why it's difficult.

My aunt died last year,
and I thought the sadness would pass,

You used to sleep with this man?

He's so much younger than you.

I used to sleep with a lot of men.
And some of them were younger than me.

Why didn't you talk to me about it?

Because you're pregnant,

tidy up our uniforms,

868
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
and get our general shit together.
