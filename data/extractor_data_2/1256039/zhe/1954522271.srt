1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,060
Oh,look, Saturn 3is on.
看啊 正在放"土星三号"呢

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,500
I don't want to watch Saturn
3. Deep Space Nine is better.
我不想看"土星三号" "深空九号"更好看

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,320
How isDeep Space
Ninebetter thanSaturn 3?
"深空九号"哪有"土星三号"好看

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,590
Simple subtraction will
tell you it's six better.
简单的减法告诉你 好看六个数儿

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,230
Compromise. WatchBabylon 5.
折衷一下 看"巴比伦五号"好了

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,120
In what sense is that a compromise?
这是哪门子折衷啊?

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,760
Well,five is partway between three...
恩 五处在三和九之间...

Never mind.

00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,290
I'll tell you what. How about
we go rock-paper-scissors?
要不这样 我们来用石头剪子布决定

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,190
Ooh,I don't think so.
不行 我不干

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,260
Anecdotal evidence suggests that
in the game of rock-paper-scissors,
数据统计显示 在石头-剪子-布中

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,310
players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80%
of the time due to the limited number of outcomes.
由于出法太少 相熟的玩家
有75%到80%的可能性会打平

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,860
I suggest rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock.
我建议采用石头-剪刀-布-蜥蜴-史波克

Spock smashes scissors.
史波克轰碎剪子

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,230
Scissors decapitates lizard.
剪子腰斩蜥蜴

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240

蜥蜴吃布

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,570
Paper disproves Spock.

00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,190
Spock vaporizes rock.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,990
And as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.
再加上一如既往的规则 石头砸剪子

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,510
Okay,I think I got it.
行啊 我应该会玩了

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,870
Rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock!
石头-剪刀-布-蜥蜴-史波克

28
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,960
Hello,boys.
嗨 伙计们

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,680
Ahoy,matey.
啊嗬 朋友

30
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,520
Noticed the eye patch,did you?
看见这个眼罩了 对吧

31
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,260
It's all part of a technique I've
been studying for picking up women.
这是我泡妞宝典中的一种技巧

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,510
You employ a visual display designed to
make yourself distinctive and memorable.
给别人视觉上的冲击力
让你显的与众不同

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,710
Oh,yes,like the male peacock with brilliant plumage
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
就像雄孔雀有漂亮的羽毛
或者发情的狒狒有隆起的臀部一样

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,850
Or in this case,the bar
mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
或者可以这么说
像一个得红眼病的犹太男

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,080
Mock me if you will, but it works.
尽管嘲笑我吧 不过这招确实有用

36
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,450
You show up at a club in something distinctive,
scope out your target and toss out some negs.
你穿成这样去泡吧
寻找你的目标 然后抛出几句"反话"

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,340
What are negs?
啥叫"反话"?

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,910
A neg is a negative compliment that
throws a pretty woman off her game,
就是反向的恭维
让漂亮女性忘了她们的小缺陷

39
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,600
like "Normally,I'm not turned on
by big teeth, but on you,they work."
好比这样 "通常情况 牙有些大的女士
不会让我动心 但你就不一样了"

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,630
I got a whole list of 'em.
Who wants to be my wingman?
我有一大堆招数呢

You're not gonna need a wingman.
你用不着找个泡妞搭档

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,040
You're gonna need a paramedic.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,490
Howard,your scooter's blocking my car.
Howard 你的摩托挡住我的车了

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,910
Aw,did you get pinkeye again?
喔 你又得红眼病了?

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,750
Step one: she notices the eye patch.
第一步 她注意到了我的眼罩

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,780
May I say,Penny, not a lot of women could
look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?
这么说吧 Penny 不是所有女人
都和你一样 头发油油的还这么性感

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,430
Yeah,just move your stupid scooter before
I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
赶紧把你那破摩托车开走
不然我马上扔进垃圾堆

对不起 我现在不看克隆人战争的电视剧
我得先看电影版

52
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,660
I prefer to let George Lucas
disappoint me in the order he intended.
乔治卢卡斯肯定会让我失望
就顺着他的顺序来吧

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,640
Well,I want to watch it now.
我现在就要看

rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
那又到了石头-剪子-布-蜥蜴-史波克
的经典一刻了

55
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,430
Watch whatever you want.
你爱看什么看什么吧

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,140
I saw what you did there.
我看到你的魄力了

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,530
What'd I do?
我的魄力?

58
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,820
Hello. Hey,Howard. What's wrong?
嗨 Howard 什么事

59
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,780
Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
好 好 我们这就过去

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,750
What happened?

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,430
Defcon 5 means "no danger."

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,490
Defcon 1 is a cris.
一级战备状态才是危机来临

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,560
How can 5 not be worse than 1?
五级怎么会还不如一级?

68
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,850
Yeah,Star Trek V worse thanI.
就是啊  星际迷航第五部比第一部难看

69
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,660
Okay,first of all, that's a
comparison of quality, not intensity.
首先来说 我们比较的是影片的品质
而不是激烈程度

70
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,490
Secondly,Star Trek I is
orders-of-magnitude worse thanStar Trek V.
再说 星战迷航第一部差第五部
不止一个数量级

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,610
Are you joking?
你开什么玩笑

72
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,920
Star Trek Vis the standard against
which all badness is measured.
星际迷航5简直就是
"没有最烂只有更烂"的最好诠释

73
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,800
No,no.
不对 不对

74
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,740
Star Trek V has specific
failures in writing and direction,
星际迷航5只是剧本失败 导演很烂

75
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,830
whileStar Trek Ifails across the board: art
direction,costuming, music,sound editing.
但星际迷航1 所有部分都很烂
艺术执导 服装 配乐 音效剪辑

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,530
Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
表再纠结战备状态了 赶快走吧

77
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,580
Star Trek V.
星际迷航5

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,800
All right,will you at least stipulate thatStar
Trek IV: The Voyage Homeis inarguably the best?
至少你得承认 "星际迷航4:重回地球"
是最好看的 这毫无争议

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,050
I have three words
for you: Wrath of Khan.
送你五个字 凯恩的愤怒 (星际迷航2)

80
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,140
- Oh,thank God, you're here.
- What's the emergency?

I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
我把火星探测器卡在一条裂沟里了

On a dusty highway just
outside Bakersfield.

Where do you think? On Mars!

Yeah,baby,I'll be right in.

You brought a girl to the
Mars Rover control room?

the bar. She's a doctor.
是啊 我在酒吧搭上她的 她是个医生

mother won't care she's not Jewish.
送一次免费的钡餐灌肠
我妈肯定再不介意她不是犹太人了

90
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,620
Wait a minute. So the eye
patch and the insults worked?
等一下 这么说眼罩和反向恭维奏效了

91
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,070
No,there were three other
guys with eye patches.
没有 那里还有三个带眼罩的

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,880
It was a fiasco.
简直一败涂地

93
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,950
What did work was, "How'd you like to
visit a secret government facility?"
奏效的是这招:
"你想不想参观一处秘密政府设施?"

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
So what exactly do you want us to do?
那你到底要我们做些什么?

95
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,860
I need you and Raj to help me
get the Rover out of the ditch
我要你和Raj
帮我把火星探测器从沟里拖出来

before somebody notices she's here.

She doesn't exactly have clearance.
她进来都没开证明

98
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,400
Really? They don't let
strange women from honky-tonks
真的吗? 这儿不许泡廉价酒馆的女人进来

99
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,590
come in and play with $200 million
government projects on distant planets?
拿遥远星球上价值2亿的政府装备

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
Yes,I was bad.

My mother is so gonna love her.

真甜蜜阿

Out of curiosity, did he
ever have a shot with you?

135
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,770
I believe the appropriate metaphor
here involves a river of excrement
此刻最恰当的比喻应该包括
一条臭水沟

136
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,020
and a Native American water vessel
without any means of propulsion.
还有一艘没有推动器的土著船

137
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,450
Hang on. There's got
to be other options.
等等 总归有别的办法吧

138
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,340
You could try calling Triple-A.
也可以试试给独立宇航员联盟打电话

139
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,100
But based on NASA's latest timetable,
they won't get there for 35 years.
不过根据航空航天局最新时间表
他们35年后才能到那儿

140
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,440
Plus I understand you have to be standing next
to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
而且就算到了 你也得排号

141
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh,snap.
牛叉叉的 (snap有"折断一意")

142
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,890
Snap what?
什么断了?

143
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,760
Okay,I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
好吧 那我们得改B计划了

144
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,540
What's Plan B?
B计划是啥?

145
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,570
Erase all the hard drives,
scrap the surveillance tapes,
洗白硬盘 销毁监视录像带

146
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,510
wipe our fingerprints
off every surface and run.
擦干净我们的指纹 开溜

147
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,950
Why wasn't that Plan A?
这咋不是A计划呢?

148
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,010
A NASA spokesman states
that due to the loss of data,
航空航天局发言人称
由于数据丢失

149
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,960
they will most likely be unable to determine
the cause of the Mars Rover's malfunction.
很难确定火星探测器的故障原因

150
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,210
This is not the first time an exploratory
mission to Mars has ended in disappointment.
这已不是火星探险计划第一次
如此失望而终了

151
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,370
Thank God for Plan B.
还好我们有B计划

152
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,350
Howard,didn't you say you
worked on the Mars Rover?
Howard 你不是说过
你在做火星探测器的工作吗?

153
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,150
No,you're mistaken.
没 你记错了

154
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,570
Yeah,when we first met, you said that if I
went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
没 我们第一次见面 你就说
如果和你约会 我就可以在火星上开车玩

155
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,490
I don't know what you're talking about.
搞不懂你在说什么

156
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,230
Will you all excuse me?
抱歉离开下

157
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,440
Leonard is subtly signaling that
he'd like to talk to me in private.
Leonard微妙的暗示了
他想和我单独谈谈

158
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,700
No. Yeah,I remember specifically.
不 我很清楚地记得

159
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,040
You started by asking if I was from Mars
because my ass was out of this world.
你一张嘴就问我 是否来自火星
因为我的翘臀地球罕见

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,920
Well,that does sound like me, but no.
很有我风格 但不是我啦

161
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,240
- Is there some problem?
- Yeah.
- 出什么状况了吗?
- 是的

162
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,750
Listen,I have to kinda
sneak out for a while.
我得溜出去一会儿

163
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,070
All right,good-bye.
好的 拜拜

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,870
No,wait!
不 等下!

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,740
If anyone asks you where
I went, you don't know.
要是有人问我去哪儿了 你就说不知道

166
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,170
Whereareyou going?

167
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,350

Who would ask me?
谁会问我呢?

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,180
I can't tell you that,either.
也不能告诉你这个

170
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,450
So you brought me in here to
inform me that you can't tell me
你带我进来就是要告诉我
你不能告诉我

171
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,500
where you're going and you
can't tell me who might ask?
你要去哪儿
也不能告诉我谁会问起?

172
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,050
Yeah,I really didn't think this through.
对呀 是我欠考虑

173
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,180
- Leonard,a moment.
- What?
- Leonard 先别走
- 啥?

174
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,800
If someone-- and of course,we
don't know who this would be--
要是有人... 当然不知到底是谁了...

175
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,520
does ask where you've
gone, what should I say?
问起你去哪儿 我该说什么呢?

- Are you going to the office?

- 不是

178
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,980
Then how can I say it convincingly?
那我怎么能说得自然啊?!

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,220
Just say,"Leonard went totheoffice."

180
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,150
All right. Leonard went tothe office.

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,100
What is... No,not like that!

182
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,560
Just,"Leonard went to the office."
就说 "Leonard到办公室去了"

183
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,770
This would have worked out a lot better if
you'd just told me you were going to the office.
如果你直接说你要去办公室
就好办多了嘛

184
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,690

279
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,860
*******

280
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,610

lizard-Spock.
石头-剪子-布-蜥蜴-史波克

284
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,210
Howard is employing a schoolyard
paradigm in which you are,
Howard决定使用操场模型
在这个模型里

285
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,910
for all intents and purposes,deceased.
无论从哪一点看 你都是死的

286
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,780
He intends to act on this
by not speaking to you,

所以不和你说话

287
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,340
feigning an inability to
hear you when you speak

and otherwise refusing to
acknowledge your existence.

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,860
Why are you cooperating with him?

I believe this is an extension
of the death metaphor.

The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic

just gonna eat the dumpling.

one on the horizon,so...

alive! It's a miracle!
Leonard Stephanie 你们活过来了!
神啊 奇迹出现了!

It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into
the crevice, but one thing's certain:
目前还不知道 火星探测器是怎么
