1
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:44,879
So, Kathy, the Prime Minister saw fit
to invite one into the Cabinet

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,274
and, well, here one is.

3
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,435
Isn't it a terrific responsibility?

4
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,438
I suppose, if one chooses to dedicate
one's life to public service,

5
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,039
responsibility is something one accepts.

6
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:00,993
- But all this power!
- I know, I know!

7
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:05,158
Frightening sometimes.
But it also makes one very humble.

8
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:10,318
There one sits at the Cabinet table,
Number 10 Downing Street, and one realises...

9
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,475
Bernard rang, O humble one.

10
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:16,193
Central House want you to watch
a programme on BBC2.

11
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:19,959
Maureen Watkins, MP.
One of the backbench MPs.

12
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:25,518
Not my favourite lady. A rampaging feminist.
I don't think I'll bother. Don't write that down.

13
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:31,077
I like Maureen Watkins. Don't you think
that women are still the exploited sex?

14
00:01:31,244 --> 00:01:36,000
All of us in 5B think that women
are exploited at work and at home

15
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:41,158
and still it's a world designed by men
and run by men for men's convenience.

16
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,956
- Like SHE says.
- Not any longer, surely?

17
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,402
- She doesn't carry any weight in the House.
- No, it's full of men.

18
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:56,841
- Thank you. Anything else you'd like to ask?
- Just one last question.

19
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:01,521
As a minister with all this power,
what have you personally achieved?

20
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:04,403
Achieved? Oh, well, all sorts of things.

21
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:08,274
Membership of the Privy Council,
the Party Policy Committee...

22
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:12,153
No, things you've done
that makes life better for other people.

23
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,723
- Makes life better?
- Yes.

24
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:19,593
For other people?
There must be a number of things.

25
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:24,316
That's what one's job is all about.
18 hours a day, 7 days a week.

26
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,596
Could you give me examples?

27
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:30,757
- Makes it a bit boring otherwise.
- Examples.

28
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:35,918
Difficult to know where to start. So much
of government is collective decisions.

29
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:40,919
All of us together, best minds in the country,
hammering it out.

30
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:45,236
But what will you look back on
afterwards and say "I did that."

31
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:49,192
You know, like a writer can look at his books.

32
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:54,199
Government is a complex business.
So many people have to have their say.

33
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:59,961
These things take time. Rome wasn't built
in a day... Good heavens, is that the time?

34
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,594
I really must be getting my boxes. Excuse me.

35
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,757
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

36
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:12,123
Such fun, having this little talk. And you'll
let me approve the article, as we agreed?

37
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:14,275
- Bye.
- Bye.

38
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,076
Bright kid.

39
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:27,034
Last interview I give for a school magazine.
She asked some difficult questions.

40
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:31,995
Just innocent. She assumed there was
some moral basis to your activities.

41
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,918
- Well, there is.
- Oh, Jim, don't be silly!

42
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,873
- (SIGHS)
- What are you sighing for?

43
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,635
I'm not sighing.

44
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,276
(SIGHS)

45
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:52,040
- Out with it.
- Well, what have I achieved? She's right.

46
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:55,913
- It really does make you humble!
- I can't get any bills through.

47
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,282
- The time's taken up for the next two years.
- Reform the Civil Service.

48
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,639
- Impossible. Catch 22.
- Why?

49
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:07,719
Supposing I suggested 50 terrific reforms,
who would have to implement them?

50
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,876
(BOTH) The Civil Service.

51
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:12,353
All right, I tell you what.

52
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,118
Not 50 reforms, just one.

53
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,284
Huh! What?

54
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:20,835
If you achieve one import reform,
that'd be something.

55
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:23,997
Get me in the record books!
What do you suggest?

56
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,838
Make them put more women into top jobs.

57
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:31,203
Women are half the population,
they should be half the Permanent Secretaries.

58
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:35,358
- How many women are there at the top?
- Not many.

59
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,992
Equal opportunities.

60
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:42,795
I'll have a go.
After all, there's a principle at stake.

61
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:46,037
You're going to do something
out of pure principle?

62
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:48,082
- Yes.
- Oh, Jim.

63
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,600
Principles are excellent vote winners.

64
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:58,444
- We don't have to do anything?
- No. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are wrong.

65
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:01,324
And all the other points are covered.

66
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:05,478
I don't have to make a decision.
I don't even have to apologise.

67
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:08,364
- Can you do a reply for me?
- Done it.

68
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,915
Fantastic. Why don't they make more
Under-Secretaries like you?

69
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:15,360
- Anything else, Minister?
- No.

70
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:20,804
Tell me, Sarah, how many women
are there at the top of the Civil Service?

71
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:24,799
No Permanent Secretaries.
Four out of 150 Deputy Secretaries.

72
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:28,560
- What about your grade? Under-Secretary?
- There are 27 of us.

73
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,523
- Doesn't sound too bad. Out of how many?
- 578.

74
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:38,638
- But that's appalling! Aren't you appalled?
- Not really. I find it comic.

75
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:44,562
But then I find most of the Civil Service comic.
It's run by men, after all.

76
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,405
What can you? What can I do?

77
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,556
- Are you serious, Minister?
- Yes.

78
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:56,083
It's easy. Bring top women from the professions,
commerce, industry, straight into the top grades.

79
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:02,400
The pay is good for women. Long holidays,
pensions. You'd get high-quality applicants.

80
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:05,398
- And they could do the job?
- Of course.

81
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:09,399
With respect, if you can make
a journalist MP into a minister,

82
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:14,559
why can't you make a senior partner
from a legal firm into an Under-Secretary?

83
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,923
Most of the work here only needs
about two O-levels, anyway.

84
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:24,073
- Good point. Sarah, thank you very much.
- Thank you, Minister.

85
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:32,157
- You rang, Minister?
- Bernard, Sarah told...

86
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,715
- Yes, Minister?
- I wish you'd call me Jim when we're alone.

87
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,683
Oh, I'll try to remember that, Minister.

88
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,917
Sarah tells me this complaint is nonsense.

89
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:46,044
- Oh, fine. So we can CGSM it.
- CGSM?

90
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,960
Civil service code. It stands for
Consignment of Geriatric Shoe Manufacturers.

91
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:55,359
Load of old cobblers, Minister.

92
00:06:56,685 --> 00:07:02,715
I'm not a civil servant. I shall use my own code.
I shall write "round objects".

93
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:09,843
Ah, Minister, you wanted a word about staffing?

94
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:12,997
- Yes, Humphrey.
- Morning, Bernard.

95
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,156
I've made a policy decision.

96
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:19,841
I'm going to do something about the number
of women in the Civil Service.

97
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,599
Surely there aren't all that many.

98
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:27,161
- That's my point.
- The Minister thinks we need more.

99
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,122
- Many more.
- More?

100
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:35,599
We're quite well up to establishment on typists,
cleaners and tea ladies. Any ideas, Bernard?

101
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:41,362
- We are a bit short on temporary secretaries.
- I'm talking about Permanent Secretaries.

102
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,478
- Permanent...
- We need female mandarins.

103
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,636
Sort of satsumas, Minister.

104
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,514
Sit down, will you, Bernard.

105
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,722
- How many Permanent Secretaries are there?
- 41, I believe.

106
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:59,878
- And how many of those are women?
- Well, broadly speaking...

107
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,718
Not having the figures to hand, I'm not sure.

108
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,353
- Approximately.
- Approximately... none.

109
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:11,799
None. And I understand there are about 150
Deputy Secretaries. How many are women?

110
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:14,195
- Well, it's difficult to say.
- Why?

111
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:17,277
There's a lot of old women among the men.

112
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,561
- Four.
- Are there really?

113
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:27,719
I'm going to announce a quota of 25% women
Deputy Secretaries and Permanent Secretaries

114
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,875
to be achieved in four years.

115
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:34,641
Wait a minute, Minister. I'm obviously
in total sympathy with your objectives.

116
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,763
- Obviously.
- Of course we must have more women.

117
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:42,282
Of course! All of us are deeply concerned
by this apparent imbalance,

118
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,436
but these things take time.

119
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,802
- I want to make a start straight away.
- I agree.

120
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:52,436
I propose we make a start by setting up
an inter-departmental committee...

121
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:56,153
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant and you know it.

122
00:08:56,325 --> 00:09:00,682
No delays. This needs a sledgehammer.
We must cut through the red tape.

123
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:05,759
- You can't cut tape with a sledgehammer...
- You know what I mean.

124
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:09,964
Minister, you do me an injustice.
I was not about to suggest delays.

125
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,593
- Oh, sorry.
- That's all right.

126
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:15,757
I suggest that, if we are to have 25% quota,

127
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:21,760
we need a larger intake at the recruitment stage
so eventually there'll be 25% in the top jobs.

128
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:24,200
- When?
- (BOTH) In 25 years.

129
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:28,153
No, Humphrey, you haven't quite
got my drift. I mean NOW.

130
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,600
- Oh... you mean, NOW?
- Got it in one, Humphrey.

131
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,033
It takes time to do things NOW.

132
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:43,998
The three articles of Civil Service faith:
It takes longer to do things quickly;

133
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:48,920
it's more expensive to do them cheaply
and more democratic to do them in secret.

134
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,997
I have suggested four years. Masses of time.

135
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,361
Oh, dear me, no!

136
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't mean political time, I mean real time.

137
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:04,917
Civil servants are grown like...
like oak trees, not mustard and cress.

138
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,882
They bloom and ripen
with the seasons, they mature like...

139
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:16,234
- Like yourself.
- Well, I was about to say like an old port.

140
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,997
Like Grimsby, perhaps.

141
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:25,716
- Yes, I was being serious, Minister.
- I foresaw this problem.

142
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:30,480
I propose we solve it by bringing in
top women from outside the service

143
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,715
to fill vacancies in the top jobs.

144
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,283
I...

145
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:39,603
- I don't think I quite understood.
- Watch my mouth, Humphrey.

146
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,882
We will bring in women from outside.

147
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:48,038
But the strength of the system is that it is
pure and unsullied by outside influences.

148
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,197
People move jobs.
Why should the Civil Service be different?

149
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,959
It IS different. It demands subtlety.

150
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,922
- Discretion.
- Devotion to duty.

151
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,394
- Soundness.
- Soundness! Well said, Bernard!

152
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:04,195
Civil servants require endless patience
and boundless understanding.

153
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,754
They need to be able
to change horses mid-stream,

154
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:11,156
as politicians change what they call their minds.

155
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:15,398
- You have these talents?
- Well, it is just that one's been properly...

156
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,715
- Matured. Like Grimsby.
- Trained.

157
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:22,601
Ask yourself if there isn't
something wrong with the system.

158
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:27,156
- Why are there so few women deputies?
- They keep leaving to have babies.

159
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:31,317
- At nearly 50? Surely not.
- I don't know. I'm on your side.

160
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,478
- We do need more women at the top.
- I'm not waiting 25 years.

161
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,638
- There's a vacancy for Deputy Secretary here.
- Ye-es.

162
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:44,082
- I shall appoint a woman. Sarah Harrison.
- Sarah Harrison?!

163
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,363
- I think she's very able, don't you?
- Very. For a woman, for a person.

164
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,754
And she is an original thinker.

165
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:55,123
Yes, that's true, but she doesn't
let it interfere with her work.

166
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,834
- What have you got against her?
- Nothing. She's excellent.

167
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,802
I'm a supporter of hers.

168
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:05,277
I advocated her promotion
to Under-Secretary at a very early age.

169
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:08,642
- Would you agree that she is outstanding?
- Yes.

170
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:13,276
- So, on balance, it is a good idea?
- On balance... yes and no.

171
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:18,034
- That's not a very clear answer.
- It's a balanced answer.

172
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,595
The point is she's too young and it's not her turn.

173
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:26,964
I knew you'd say that! This is exactly what's
wrong with the Civil Service - Buggins' turn!

174
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:31,721
- The best people should be promoted!
- Exactly! As soon as it's their turn!

175
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,276
Oh, nonsense! Napoleon ruled Europe
when he was in his 30s!

176
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:40,961
- Alexander conquered the world in his 20s.
- They'd have made poor Deputy Secretaries.

177
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,673
- They didn't wait their turn!
- And look what happened to them.

178
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,836
And look what's happened to us!

179
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:51,236
Instead of being run
by a lot of young, able, energetic men,

180
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:56,399
this country's being run by tired, cynical
55-year-olds who just want a quiet life!

181
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:00,557
Had you anyone specific in mind?

182
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,995
Yes and no, Humphrey.

183
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:12,240
Oh, Minister, Sarah Harrison is an excellent
civil servant and a bright hope for the future,

184
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:17,524
but she is our most junior Under-Secretary
and I will not recommend her promotion.

185
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:21,836
- I think you're a sexist.
- Minister, how could you say such a thing?

186
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:25,553
I'm very pro-women. Wonderful people, women.

187
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:30,279
Sarah is a dear lady.
I'm one of her greatest admirers.

188
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:36,553
But, if the cause of women is to be advanced,
it must be done with care, tact and discretion.

189
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:42,721
She is our only woman contender for a top job.
We mustn't push her too fast.

190
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:46,764
- Women find top jobs very difficult.
- Can you hear yourself?

191
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:52,921
If women could be good Permanent Secretaries,
there would be more of them. Stands to reason.

192
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:56,316
- No...
- I'm not anti-feminist! I love women!

193
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:59,682
Some of my best friends are women!

194
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,721
Er... my wife, indeed.

195
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:10,119
But Sarah is as yet very inexperienced
and her children are still of school age.

196
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,118
- They might get mumps!
- You might get shingles!

197
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:18,836
I might indeed if you continue in this vein.
What if her children caused her to miss work?

198
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:23,795
Would she have reached Under-Secretary
in that case? She is the best person!

199
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,162
If you promote women
just because they're the best person,

200
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,238
you will create a lot of resentment
throughout the Civil Service!

201
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,398
- Not from the women in it.
- Well, that hardly matters, does it?

202
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,283
Hardly matters?

203
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:42,284
There are so few of them.

204
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:50,000
I've told him women are different,
but he can't grasp it.

205
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:52,553
They put such strains on a team.

206
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,764
They react differently. They're so emotional.
Not rational like us.

207
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:02,601
No. It's hopeless when you tell them off. Either
they get into a frightful bate or start blubbing.

208
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:06,997
And if they're not the sort who blub,
they become frightfully hard and butch.

209
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,156
Not the least bit attractive.

210
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,522
- They're full of prejudices.
- Make silly generalisations.

211
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:18,843
- They think in stereotypes.
- (BOTH) Mmm.

212
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,724
Arnold, what do you think I should do?

213
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:25,878
Lecture him at such length
on the matter that he becomes bored

214
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:28,081
and loses interest in the idea.

215
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:32,238
Yes, might work.
Mind you, he doesn't get bored easily.

216
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,601
- He even finds himself interesting.
- They all do.

217
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:40,555
- All the ones who listen to what we're saying.
- Not many of those.

218
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:44,718
The standard second ploy is to tell him
the unions won't wear it.

219
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:47,604
- They'd like it.
- That's beside the point.

220
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:52,281
- Oh, yes, sorry.
- What does his wife think about all this?

221
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:57,041
I gather she's in favour of promoting Harrison.
In fact, she may be behind it.

222
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:02,643
I see. Does she know that Sarah Harrison
is rather attractive?

223
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,634
No, I don't think they've ever met...

224
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,196
Good idea.

225
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,675
We must mobilise the Cabinet
against this quota nonsense.

226
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:19,043
- They'll be in favour of it.
- We can get them to change their minds.

227
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:23,437
- They change their minds fairly easily.
- Just like a lot of women!

228
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:25,754
Thank God they don't blub!

229
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:32,119
Minister, I have come
to the conclusion that you were right.

230
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:37,479
- Are you being serious?
- Yes, indeed.

231
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:43,675
I have taken your ideas on board and I am now
positively against discrimination against women

232
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:48,634
and in favour of positive discrimination -
discriminating discrimination, of course.

233
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,115
Yes... I think I've got that.

234
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:56,038
The view is, at the very highest level,
that this should happen.

235
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,673
- Good.
- However...

236
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:04,678
There is a problem about the quota.
Mind if I sit down? The unions won't wear it.

237
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,317
- Really? Let's have 'em in. We'll talk about it.
- Er... no, Minister.

238
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:13,443
- That would... just stir up a hornets' nest.
- Why?

239
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:20,155
Well, if I might suggest...
that we be realistic about this.

240
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:24,875
- By realistic, you mean drop the whole scheme.
- Oh, dear me, no!

241
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,763
But, perhaps, a pause to re-group.

242
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:32,361
A lull in which to reassess the situation
and discuss alternative strategies.

243
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:35,278
A space of time for reflection and deliberation.

244
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,878
You mean drop the whole scheme.

245
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,639
No, I've set my hand to the plough,
I've made the decision.

246
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:46,798
We shall have a 25% quota of women
within the next four years

247
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,956
and, to make a start,
I shall appoint Sarah Harrison.

248
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:54,322
- I promise you, that is the wrong decision.
- Principle, Humphrey, principle.

249
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:59,433
I'm sure my Cabinet colleagues will support me.
There's a lot of votes in women's rights.

250
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:03,392
Votes? I thought you said
it was a matter of principle.

251
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,918
For ME. I was talking about them.

252
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,961
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Yes?

253
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,115
- Mrs Hacker's here.
- Send her in.

254
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:17,675
Could she come in? Could you sign
the letters before you go, Minister?

255
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:21,076
- Hello. Get Humphrey to give you a drink.
- Sherry?

256
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:25,682
Remember that letter you wrote
"round objects" on?

257
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:28,438
Sir Humphrey has commented on it.

258
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:32,995
- What's he say?
- "Who is Round and to what does he object?"

259
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:38,683
Here you are. Your very good health.

260
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:42,439
Yes, it's a slow business changing
the Civil Service.

261
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,596
What about promoting
this woman Jim was talking about?

262
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:51,361
Oh, yes, well... your husband certainly has
an eye for talent and Sarah's very talented.

263
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,516
- Quite delightful, real charmer. Cheers.
- Really?

264
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:58,836
I very much admire this new generation
of women civil servants

265
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,802
compared to the old battle-axes I remember!

266
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:09,359
Of course, they're not all as beautiful as Sarah,
but... they do manage to keep their femininity.

267
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:14,996
- Jim never discussed what she looks like.
- Oh, well, perhaps he hasn't noticed.

268
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:19,760
I find that hard to believe.
He does spend a lot of time with her.

269
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:23,360
And even more... if she's promoted.
Shall we sit down?

270
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:31,442
And so, gentlemen, my minister
is set on creating a quota of 25% women,

271
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,799
leading to an eventual 50%.

272
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,717
- Parity, I see.
- Yes. Mm.

273
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,913
It seems right and proper to me that men
and women be treated fairly and equally.

274
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:45,634
I speak for all of us
when I say that, in principle,

275
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:48,682
there should be
such targets set and goals achieved.

276
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,641
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)

277
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:54,923
- Bill?
- Well, I'm fully in favour of this idea.

278
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:58,679
We must have positive discrimination
in favour of women.

279
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,438
It wouldn't work with the Foreign Office.

280
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:05,392
We couldn't post women ambassadors
to Iran or Muslim nations.

281
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:10,763
- No, quite, quite.
- The Third World is not so advanced as us.

282
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:15,520
And as we have to send diplomats
to new postings every three years,

283
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:19,757
this idea is obviously not for us,
but I do approve the principle.

284
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,875
- Neil?
- I'm in favour of it.

285
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:26,433
I think we need the feminine touch.

286
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:30,995
Women are better at handling
some problems than men. No doubt about it.

287
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:34,952
We would have to make
an exception in the Home Office.

288
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,913
Women are not the right people
to run prisons or the police.

289
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:42,121
Quite probably,
they wouldn't want to do it, anyway.

290
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,482
- But you do agree with the principle?
- Oh, yes, without question.

291
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:50,603
- Peter?
- Yes, the same applies to Defence... alas.

292
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:52,755
All those admirals and generals.

293
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:57,315
It wouldn't be possible
to appoint a woman as Head of Security.

294
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:00,044
M would have to become F.

295
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:06,955
Yes, Defence is clearly a man's world,
like Industry and Employment.

296
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,843
All those trade union leaders!

297
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,199
But what about the DHSS? John?

298
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:16,562
I'm happy to say woman are well represented
near the top of the DHSS.

299
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:20,842
After all, we have two of the four
Deputy Secretaries in Whitehall.

300
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:26,834
Not eligible for Permanent Secretary
because they're Deputy Chief Medical Officers.

301
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:31,156
I'm not sure they're really suitable.
No, that's unfair.

302
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:36,318
Of course, women are 80% of our clerical staff
and 99% of the typing grades.

303
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:41,558
We're not doing too badly. In principle,
I'm in favour of them going to the top.

304
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,123
Good, good.

305
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:47,516
The feeling of the meeting is,
in principle, that we're all in favour

306
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,879
of equal rights for the ladies,

307
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:53,639
but there are special problems
in individual departments.

308
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:57,513
- (ALL) Hear hear!
- What about this question of the quota?

309
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:01,199
- Frankly, I'm against it.
- (ALL) Oh, yes, not on!

310
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:06,358
We must, in my view, have the right
to promote the best man for the job,

311
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,084
regardless of sex.

312
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:13,038
Speaking as an ardent feminist myself,

313
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:17,403
I think the problem lies
in recruiting the right sort of women.

314
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,953
Married women with families drop out

315
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:24,117
because they cannot give their work
their full, single-minded attention.

316
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,275
Unmarried women with no children

317
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,961
are not fully-rounded people
with a thorough understanding of life.

318
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:36,355
So, in practice, it's rarely possible to find
a fully-rounded married woman,

319
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:42,793
with a happy home and three children, prepared
to devote virtually her whole life to a department.

320
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:48,197
It's Catch 22, really.
Well, Catch 22, sub-paragraph A!

321
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:55,117
I think we must ensure that our respective
ministers oppose this quota idea in Cabinet

322
00:22:55,284 --> 00:23:00,278
by drawing our own minister's attention
to each department's special problems.

323
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:04,915
But we will recommend the principle
of equal opportunities at every level.

324
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,076
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)

325
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:09,474
May I suggest one more thing?

326
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:15,640
My minister sees the promotion of women
as a means of creating greater diversity

327
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,795
at the top of the service.

328
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:24,233
We should stress to our ministers that, frankly,
you couldn't find a more diverse lot than us.

329
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:29,478
- (ALL) Absolutely!
- A real cross-section of the nation.

330
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:37,198
Ah, Minister, how was Cabinet?

331
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:41,712
- Bit odd, actually.
- Why?

332
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:45,274
We were talking about
the top jobs quota for women.

333
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:48,163
- Was it agreed?
- That's what's so odd.

334
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:53,921
They all agreed in principle, but then said
it wouldn't work in their own departments.

335
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,917
- They didn't support me at all.
- Extraordinary.

336
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:59,917
And I'm not getting support from Annie.

337
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:03,997
- Really? What, about this quota?
- Well, about promoting Sarah.

338
00:24:04,164 --> 00:24:06,962
- You'd think she'd be 100% behind it.
- Indeed.

339
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,241
She goes sort of distant when I mention it.

340
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:13,875
- Dead against it now.
- Even more extraordinary.

341
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:16,638
Oh, well, seems the only thing left.

342
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:19,637
- Something I can achieve.
- Yes, indeed.

343
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:24,400
Shall I ask Mrs Harrison to come in?
Bernard, would you be kind enough?

344
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:28,474
At least this is something I can say I have done.

345
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:30,475
- Indeed.
- Lighting a spark.

346
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,839
Carrying a torch, even.

347
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,713
Ah, Sarah, do sit down.

348
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:39,875
- Thank you.
- Humphrey.

349
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:45,958
Sarah, as you know, there is a vacancy
for a Deputy Secretary in this department.

350
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,116
In spite of you being
the most junior Under-Secretary,

351
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,878
but because you are the outstanding person,

352
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:57,243
Sir Humphrey and I will recommend you for
promotion to the grade of Deputy Secretary.

353
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:02,194
I... I don't know what to say.

354
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:06,676
- No need to say anything.
- A single thank you should suffice.

355
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,116
No... Well... I mean...

356
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:15,278
Oh, gosh. Look, this is
awfully embarrassing. I mean...

357
00:25:15,444 --> 00:25:20,472
Well, I was going to tell you this week.
I'm resigning from the Civil Service.

358
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:23,555
- What?
- Resigning?

359
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:27,435
Yes, so... thank you, but no, thank you.

360
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:33,395
- Some problem at home with your children?
- Mumps?

361
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:38,201
No, I'm joining a merchant bank... as a director.

362
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:43,442
Sarah... I won't conceal from you
the fact that this is a blow.

363
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:46,721
The reason Humphrey and I
decided to recommend you

364
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:52,278
is that I've been fighting a losing battle
to improve promotion prospects for women.

365
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:55,675
You were to be my, so to speak, Trojan horse.

366
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:01,836
Quite honestly, Minister, I want a job
where I don't spend endless hours

367
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:07,601
circulating information about subjects that
don't matter to people who aren't interested.

368
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:15,401
I want a job where there's achievement rather
than merely activity. I'm tired of pushing paper.

369
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:19,079
I want to point to something and say "I did that."

370
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,838
I don't understand.

371
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,795
I know. That's why I'm leaving.

372
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,833
You're not saying the government is unimportant?

373
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,282
No, it's very important. It's just that
I haven't met anyone who's doing it.

374
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,001
Also I've had enough of the pointless intrigue.

375
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:43,361
- Intrigue?
- You know the sort of thing.

376
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:48,519
Like this women's rights nonsense.
Your using me as a Trojan horse, for instance.

377
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:52,677
They probably said the unions
wouldn't wear it if you promoted me.

378
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:57,474
- How did you know that?
- I didn't. I just know how things are done.

379
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:01,796
You don't realise
I've fought quite a battle for you.

380
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:06,003
Oh, have you? I didn't ask you
to fight a battle for me.

381
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:09,236
I'm not pleased at being part of a 25% quota.

382
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:13,920
Women are not inferior beings
and I don't enjoy being patronised.

383
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:19,721
I'm afraid you're just as paternalist
and chauvinist as the rest of them.

384
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm going somewhere where I shall
be accepted an equal, as a person.

385
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:28,194
You can't win, can you?

386
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:32,594
- May I go now?
- Hm? Yes, of course.

387
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:38,713
I'm sorry I offended you,
though I can't remember how I did.

388
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:40,283
No.

389
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:44,676
And thank you. I know you both mean well.

390
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:56,962
Women!

391
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,842
Yes, Minister.

392
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:09,321
