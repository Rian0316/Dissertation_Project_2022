1
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,892
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,311
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,022
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

4
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,275
All right, Joey, be nice.

5
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,737
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

6
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,156
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

7
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,618
I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

8
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,453
Okay, everybody relax.

9
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,581
Relax. This is not even a date.

10
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:25,586
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

11
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,922
Sounds like a date to me.

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,093
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,680
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,724
I've had that dream.

15
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:43,520
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

16
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,815
...there.

17
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,568
- Instead of...
- That's right!

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,195
That one, I've never had.

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,741
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,994
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

21
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,706
They weren't looking at you before?

22
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,543
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

23
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,506
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:16,220
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

25
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,940
This guy says, "Hello",
I wanna kill myself.

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,067
You okay, sweetie?

27
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,988
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

28
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,576
...and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,454
Carol moved out today.

30
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,458
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

31
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,882
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,510
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,137
Fine. Be murky.

34
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,558
I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

35
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,809
No, you don't.

36
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,020
To hell with her. She left me!

37
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,275
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

38
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,950
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,204
She didn't know.
How should I know?

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,792
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

41
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,754
Did I say that out loud?

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,259
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.

43
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,889
Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. ...

44
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,474
..."I'll never have grandchildren!"

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,311
Was, what? A wrong number?

46
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,229
Sorry.

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,524
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

48
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,194
You're angry. You're hurting.

49
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,738
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

50
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,782
Strip joints!

51
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,786
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

52
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,247
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

53
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,960
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,759
And I just want a million dollars!

55
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,555
Rachel?

56
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,308
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

57
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,561
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

58
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,189
...that you might be here and you are.

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,443
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

60
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,239
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

61
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,158
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe...

62
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,702
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

63
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,455
Sure!

64
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,511
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

65
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:07,558
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

66
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,394
I was in this room with
all the presents...

67
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,729
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,483
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,403
When all of a sudden I realize...
Sweet 'N Low?

70
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,864
I realized...

71
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,826
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,871
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

73
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,374
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

74
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:37,045
I always knew he looked
familiar, but...

75
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,717
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering...

76
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,596
..."Why am I doing this?"
and "Who am I doing this for?"

77
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,225
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart...

78
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,187
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

79
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,230
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,985
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

81
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,502
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ...

82
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,839
...and she's really not
happy about it.

83
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,965
"Tuna or egg salad?"

84
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,927
"Decide!"

85
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:29,681
"I'll have whatever
Christine is having."

86
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,393
Daddy, I just...
I can't marry him.

87
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,187
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,524
I just don't love him.

89
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,486
Well, it matters to me!

90
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:50,160
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

91
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,331
She should not be
wearing those pants.

92
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,667
I say push her down the stairs!

93
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,171
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

94
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,969
Come on, Daddy, listen!

95
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,390
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

96
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,017
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

97
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,312
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?"

98
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:21,108
"What if I want to be a purse?"

99
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,485
"Or a hat?"

100
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,154
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I...

101
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:30,075
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

102
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,246
You can see where he'd have trouble.

103
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,876
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

104
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,630
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

105
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,051
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

106
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,513
Well, maybe that's my decision.

107
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,932
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

108
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,603
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

109
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,362
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

110
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,240
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,119
<i>Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens</i>

112
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,999
<i>Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens</i>

113
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,794
<i>La la la something
And noodles with string</i>

114
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,798
<i>- These are a...
- I'm all better now.</i>

115
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,344
I helped.

116
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,931
This is probably for
the best, you know?

117
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,850
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

118
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,727
The whole "hat" thing.

119
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:43,315
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

120
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:48,403
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

121
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,323
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

122
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,786
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

123
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,373
I got it.

124
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,001
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

125
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,878
<i>It's Paul.</i>

126
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,549
Oh, God. Is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

127
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,301
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?

128
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,386
Maybe.

129
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,889
Your "not a real date",
is with Paul, the wine guy?

130
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,058
He finally asked you out?

131
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,395
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.

132
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,896
Rach, I can cancel.

133
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,607
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

134
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,736
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

135
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,115
That'd be good.

136
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:38,287
- Really?
- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

137
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:43,834
Does he sell it, drink it,
or he just complains a lot?

138
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,129
Hi, come in! Paul, this is...

139
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,383
...everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

140
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:56,930
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul?

141
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,267
I'll be right back.
I've just got to go a...

142
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,895
A-wandering?

143
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:08,358
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

144
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:15,866
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

145
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,330
Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip.

146
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,666
She likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot...

147
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:29,171
...over and over again, till
it starts to get a little red.

148
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,966
Shut up, Joey!

149
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,844
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

150
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,015
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

151
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,393
...so, nothing.

152
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,855
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

153
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:52,694
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your...

154
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,948
...big lizards.

155
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,537
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

156
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,748
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

157
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,126
And we're very excited about it.

158
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,296
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

159
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,924
- It's been a long day.
- Okay. Sure.

160
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,259
Pheebs, wanna help?

161
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,346
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

162
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,566
<i>Love is sweet as summer showers</i>

163
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,652
<i>Love is a wondrous work of art</i>

164
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:39,700
<i>But your love, oh, your love
Your love</i>

165
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,288
<i>Is like a giant pigeon</i>

166
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,542
<i>Crapping on my heart</i>

167
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,630
Thank you!

168
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:05,267
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

169
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,313
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

170
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:14,193
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

171
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,989
...and I cannot feel my legs.

172
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,950
We got a bookcase here.

173
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,870
It's a beautiful thing.

174
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,413
What's this?

175
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:31,752
I would have to say that is
an L-shaped bracket.

176
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:37,633
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.

177
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,970
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

178
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:48,352
This was Carol's favorite beer.

179
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:53,273
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

180
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,986
If you start with that,
we're out of here.

181
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:01,156
Please don't spoil all this fun.

182
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,741
Let me ask you a question.

183
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,329
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

184
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,289
What did you get?

185
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,457
You guys.

186
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,626
- You got screwed.
- Oh, my God.

187
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:17,548
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I'm such an idiot.

188
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:22,219
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

189
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,596
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

190
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,140
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

191
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,892
How did you get through it?

192
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,646
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

193
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,189
- Say her...
- Leg?

194
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,900
That's one way of going through it.

195
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,027
Me, I went for the watch.

196
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,740
You actually broke her watch?
The worst thing I ever did was...

197
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,994
...I shredded my old boyfriend's
favorite bath towel.

198
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,372
- Steer clear of you!
- That's right.

199
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,709
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

200
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,131
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

201
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,552
It's about me.
And I just...

202
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:13,312
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

203
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:21,653
I know that some girl is going to be
lucky to become Mr. Barry Finkel.

204
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:25,199
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

205
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:32,122
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but give me a chance to...

206
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,208
I'm divorced!

207
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,460
I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.

208
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,255
Shut up.

209
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,430
That only took me an hour.

210
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,062
Between us, we haven't had a
relationship last longer than a Mento.

211
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,942
You, however, have had the love
of a woman for four years.

212
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,487
Four years of closeness and sharing.

213
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,531
After which,
she ripped your heart out...

214
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,284
...and that is why we don't do it.

215
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,955
I don't think that was my point.

216
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,292
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

217
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,796
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

218
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:27,469
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

219
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,598
What are you talking about?
One woman.

220
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,269
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

221
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,398
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

222
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:44,319
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

223
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,116
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

224
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,910
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

225
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:56,498
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

226
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,878
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

227
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,964
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

228
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,634
Then stay out of my freezer.

229
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,098
Ever since she
walked out on me, I...

230
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,309
What? What?

231
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,895
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

232
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:22,774
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

233
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:27,237
So there's going to be a fifth date?

234
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,198
Isn't there?

235
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,367
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

236
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,205
What were you going to say?

237
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,337
Ever since she left me...

238
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,715
...I haven't been able to perform...

239
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,968
...sexually.

240
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,679
Oh, God! Oh, God!

241
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,056
I'm so sorry.

242
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:59,353
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

243
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,563
How long?

244
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,191
Two years.

245
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

246
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,202
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

247
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,999
Yeah, I do.

248
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,502
<i>We are gathered here
to join together...</i>

249
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,088
<i>... Joanie Louise Cunningham...</i>

250
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:32,177
<i>... and Charles Chachi,
Chachi, Chachi...</i>

251
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,180
<i>... in the bonds of holy matrimony.</i>

252
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,850
<i>- Marriage is the most sacred...
- See!</i>

253
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,398
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

254
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,650
"Grab a spoon."

255
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,279
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

256
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,450
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero",
mean anything to you?

257
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,582
Great story. But I gotta go.

258
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,250
I got a date with Andrea.

259
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,628
Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

260
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,257
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

261
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:15,179
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

262
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:21,226
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough...

263
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,979
...to ask a woman out...

264
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,983
...who am I going to ask?

265
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,215
Isn't this amazing?

266
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,800
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

267
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,553
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

268
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,766
I figure if I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

269
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:06,104
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."

270
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:12,194
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something...

271
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,075
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

272
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:22,287
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

273
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,083
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

274
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,418
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

275
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,048
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

276
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,888
Thank you.

277
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,598
- Thank you so much.
- Stop!

278
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,934
Last night was like...

279
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:50,607
...all my birthdays, graduations, plus
the barn-raising scene in "Witness".

280
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,324
We'll talk later.

281
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,746
Thank you.

282
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,755
That wasn't a real date.

283
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:18,093
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

284
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,722
Shut up and put my table back.

285
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,765
I've got to get to work.

286
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:30,606
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

287
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,069
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

288
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,071
Yeah, we all have jobs.

289
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:42,451
That's how we buy stuff.

290
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,703
Yeah, I'm an actor.

291
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,206
Have I seen you in anything?

292
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,750
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

293
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,754
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of "Pinocchio"...

294
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,423
...at the Little Theater in the Park.

295
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,300
It was a job, all right?

296
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,555
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

297
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,807
I will not take this abuse.

298
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,018
You're right. I'm sorry.

299
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,940
<i>Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy</i>

300
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,069
You should both know that
he's a dead man.

301
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,656
Oh, Chandler!

302
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,201
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

303
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,330
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

304
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,585
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

305
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,717
I know. He's just so...

306
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,388
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

307
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,809
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

308
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,062
- Are you in trouble!
- Big time!

309
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,607
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

310
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:59,319
We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

311
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,825
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

312
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,911
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

313
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,872
- Wish me luck!
- What for?

314
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

315
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,139
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

316
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,891
How was Florida?

317
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,352
You had sex, didn't you?

318
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:33,437
How do you do that?

319
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,481
I hate you. I'm pushing my
aunt through Parrot Jungle...

320
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,817
...and you're having sex.

321
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,487
So, who?

322
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,156
You know Paul?

323
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,241
Paul, the wine guy?

324
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,328
Yeah, I know Paul.

325
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,873
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

326
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,375
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

327
00:22:55,626 --> 00:23:01,173
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

328
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,594
Of course it was a line.

329
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,555
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

330
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,892
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than...

331
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,103
..."To get you into bed."

332
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,606
I hate men. I hate men!

333
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:22,110
Don't hate. Don't put that out
in the universe.

334
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,654
Is it me?

335
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,574
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

336
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,327
...and men with emotional
problems can hear?

337
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,997
Come here.
Give me your feet.

338
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:43,841
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

339
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,431
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

340
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,643
Guess what?

341
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,728
- You got a job?
- Are you kidding?

342
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,274
I'm trained for nothing.

343
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,568
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

344
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,319
You're surprisingly upbeat.

345
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,031
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

346
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,992
...50% percent off.

347
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:13,579
How well you know me.

348
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,832
They're my, "I don't need
a job or my parents.

349
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,711
I've got great boots", boots.

350
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,088
- How did you pay for them?
- Credit card.

351
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,382
And who pays for that?

352
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:29,261
My father.

353
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,223
Come on, is this necessary?

354
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,392
I can stop charging any time I want.

355
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,686
You can't live off your parents.

356
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:41,648
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

357
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,777
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

358
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,404
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

359
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,365
When I first came to
this city, I was 14.

360
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,535
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

361
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,787
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

362
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,626
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

363
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,544
And then he killed himself.

364
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:08,884
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

365
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,764
The word you're looking for is:

366
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,767
"Anyway..."

367
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,688
You ready?

368
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,233
No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?

369
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:27,194
"You ready to jump out of
the plane without a chute?"

370
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,487
I can't do this.

371
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,822
- I know you can.
- I don't think so.

372
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:35,285
You made coffee.
You can do anything.

373
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,957
Cut, cut, cut.

374
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,212
You know what?

375
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:49,258
We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.

376
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,928
That was a library card.

377
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:04,481
If you listen very closely, you can
hear a thousand retailers scream.

378
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,776
Welcome to the real world!

379
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:12,197
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

380
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,081
That's it.

381
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,749
You gonna crash on the couch?

382
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,463
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

383
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,884
Look what I just
found on the floor.

384
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,052
What?

385
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,013
That's Paul's watch.

386
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,474
You can just put it back
where you found it.

387
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,269
Oh, boy! All right.

388
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,398
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

389
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:56,783
- I'm sorry.
- No!

390
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:01,205
- No, have it, really.
- Split it?

391
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,795
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

392
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,424
...a major crush on you.

393
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,009
I knew.

394
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,262
You did?

395
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,974
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

396
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:24,144
I did.

397
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,525
Listen, do you think...

398
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:35,072
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

399
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:40,828
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

400
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,541
Maybe.

401
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,217
Okay, maybe I will.

402
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:01,473
- Good night.
- Good night.

403
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,322
See you.

404
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,032
Wait, wait.

405
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,952
What's with you?

406
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:26,915
I just grabbed a spoon.

407
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,883
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

408
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,759
<i>I can't believe
What I'm hearing</i>

409
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,888
<i>- What? I said you had...
- What? I said you had...</i>

410
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,472
Would you stop?

411
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:46,101
Was I doing it again?

412
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:51,064
I said that you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

413
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,026
You wouldn't know a great
butt if it bit you.

414
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:57,362
There's an image.

415
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:01,742
Would anybody like more coffee?

416
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,411
Did you make it?

417
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:08,165
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

418
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,750
Kids, new dream.

419
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,168
I'm in Las Vegas.

420
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,213
Miss, more coffee?

421
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:18,509
Excuse me? Could you give this
to that guy over there?

422
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,135
Go ahead.

423
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,512
Thank you.

424
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,972
Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

425
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:27,559
So I'm in Las Vegas.

426
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,938
I'm Liza Minnelli.
