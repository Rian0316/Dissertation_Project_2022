突然发现自己全身赤裸

- 对，没错 - 我做过那样的梦
- Oh, yeah. - I've had that dream.

我低头一看，看见有一个电话…
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...

在那里
...there.

I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

Just leave my aura alone, okay?

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,650
我会没事的，好吗？真的 我希望她开心
I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy.

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,150
- 不，你并不希望 - 是的，我不希望！

叫她去死，是她离开了我！
To hell with her. She left me!

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,160
你从来都不知道她是女同性恋
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,370
不知道！行了吧！
No! Okay?

58
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,330
为什么每个人老是要提出来？
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,750
她都不知道，我又怎么会知道？
She didn't know. How should I know?

72
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,510
我刚到你那里去，而你不在 那个拿着大锤子的家伙说
I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,880
你可能在这里 你真在这里！
...that you might be here, and you are.

...and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,650
- 当然，嘿！ - 嘿
- Sure! - Hey.

79
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,730
- 嗨 - 天啊
- Hi. - Oh, God.

80
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,120
那你现在可以告诉我们了吗 还是说我们在等着四位湿漉的伴娘?
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,340
好吧，大概在婚礼前半个小时
Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,920
我在礼物间里
I was in this room with all the presents...

83
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,920
看着那个肉汁壶
...and I was looking at this gravy boat.

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,550
那是个非常好看的肉汁壶
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,550
然后，突然…　有代糖吗？
When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,850
我发现…
- I realized...

87
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,940
我对这个肉汁壶 比对巴瑞更有冲动！
...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,150
然后我吓呆了 然后这个想法突然出现在脑中：
Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,110
巴瑞看起来多像洋芋头先生啊
How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

90
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,780
我总是觉得他眼熟，但是…
You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,290
总之 我必须离开那里，我在想：
Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,120
〝我为什么这样做，我为谁这样做？〞
"Why am I doing this?" And "Who am I doing this for?"

93
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,670
我不知道该去哪里 而且我知道我和你有点疏远了
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...

94
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,710
但你是我这个城市里唯一认识的人
...but you're the only person I know in the city.

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,590
而且没有受邀参加你的婚礼
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

96
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,880
噢，我希望你不会把它当一回事…
Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

97
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,570
我猜他给她买了个管风琴
I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...

98
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,200
而她很不喜欢那个
...and she's really not happy about it.

99
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,490
老爸，我就是无法和他结婚
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

100
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,330
对不起
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,370
我只是不爱他了
I just don't love him.

102
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,500
这对我很有关系！
Well, it matters to me.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,380
她真不应该穿那条裤子
CHANDLER: She should not be wearing those pants.

104
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,550
我觉得应该把她推下楼
I say push her down the stairs.

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,970
把她推下楼…
ALL: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,230
爸爸，听我说！
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,980
这就好像在我一生中 所有人都告诉我：〝你是鞋子！〞
It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!

108
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,230
〝你是鞋子…〞
You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!"

109
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,610
然后今天，我停下来对自己说： 〝如果我不想成为鞋子呢？
Then today I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

110
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,990
如果我想成为一个包包？
What if I wanna be a purse? You know?

111
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,950
或一顶帽子？〞
Or a hat?"

112
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,410
不，我不是要你给我买帽子 我是说我是帽子
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.

113
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,790
这是个比喻，爸爸！
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,380
你看得出他哪里听不懂
You can see where he'd have trouble.

115
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,510
爸爸，这是我的生活
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,300
也许我可以和摩妮卡住在一起
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,810
我猜我们已经确定 她要和摩妮卡住在一起了…
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.

118
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,690
也许那是我的决定
Well, maybe that's my decision.

119
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,520
也许我不需要你的钱
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

120
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,940
等等！我说也许！
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

121
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,120
呼吸，呼吸 好，就这样
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

122
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,790
试着想一些让你镇定的事…
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,870
玫瑰上的雨滴，还有猫的胡须
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens

124
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,210
门铃和雪橇铃，还有手套…
Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,340
啦啦啦，还有一些条状物…
La la la something With string

126
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,390
我现在好多了
I'm all better now.

127
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
我帮上忙啦
I helped.

128
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,180
瞧，这也许对你来讲是最好的 知道吗？
MONICA: Look, this is probably for the best, you know?

129
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,060
独立了，把握自己的生活
Independence. Taking control of your life.

130
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,610
还有，你还需要什么 你可以随时来找乔伊
And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.

131
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,200
我和钱德就住在对面 而且他经常不在
Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.

132
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,620
乔伊，不要再对她放电了 今天是她结婚的日子！
Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.

133
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,790
怎么啦，难道这还有什么规定吗？
What? Like there's a rule or something?

134
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,880
请不要再按了 那是很恐怖的声音
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,460
- 我是保罗 - 让他进来！
PAUL: Uh, it's Paul. - Buzz him in.

136
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,050
- 谁是保罗？ - 保罗，红酒达人，保罗？
- Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

Maybe.

138
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,800
等等，你今晚的〝不是真正约会〞 是和红酒达人保罗？
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?

139
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,800
- 他终于约你出去啦？ - 是的！
- He finally asked you out? - Yes.

140

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,730
罗斯，你没事吧？ 你希望我留下来吗？
Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

144
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,730
能留下就太好了…
That'd be good.

145
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,860
- 真的？ - 不，去吧！那可是红酒达人保罗耶！
- Really? - No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

146
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,120
进来，保罗，这是…
MONICA: Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,540
大家 各位，这是保罗
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,040
保罗！红酒达人！
JOEY: Paul, the wine guy.

149
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,090
- 红酒达人！ - 我没听清楚你的名字，是保罗吗？
- Wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

150
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,050
- 请坐，两秒钟就好 - 好
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds. - Okay.

151
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,310
我刚拔掉四根睫毛不是个好兆头
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

152
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,730
那么瑞秋，你今晚…打算做什么？
So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?

153
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,110
我本来应该到阿鲁巴度蜜月
Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...

154
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,320
所以，没事做！
...so, nothing.

155
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,950
对呀，你连蜜月都无法去
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.

156
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,200
不过，阿鲁巴，这个时候？
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.

157
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,950
你可以谈论一下…
Talk about your...

158
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
大蜥蜴
...big lizards.

159
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,670
总之 如果今晚你不想自己一个人的话
Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight...

160
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,710
乔伊和钱德要过来 帮我组装我的新家具
...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

161
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,050
对，而且我们为此感到兴奋
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

162
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,550
谢谢了，不过我想今晚 还是留在这里吧
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,760
- 今天真是漫长的一天 - 是呀，好吧
- It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

164
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,270
菲比，你要来帮忙吗？
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

165
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
噢，我希望我能，但是我不想
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

166
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,280
我应该把支架固定在侧面
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things...

167
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,240
用螺纹蜗轮
...using a bunch of these little worm guys.

168
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,160
我没有支架，没有看到螺纹蜗轮
I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever...

169
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,420
而且我的腿麻了
...and I cannot feel my legs.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,050
这是什么？
What's this?

171
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,260
我不知道
I have no idea.

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,550
- 搞定书架了！ - 完工了！
- Done with the bookcase. - All finished.

173
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,930
这是卡萝最喜欢的啤酒
This was Carol's favorite beer.

174
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,690
她总是直接从罐子喝，我该知道的
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

175
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,070
罗斯，我来问你一个问题
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

176
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,450
她得到家具、音响、超赞的电视…
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.

177
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,660
那你得到了什么？
What did you get?

178
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,030
你们啊
You guys.

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,280
- 天呀 - 你被耍了
- Oh, God. Oh, my God. - You got screwed.

180
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,790
- 我的老天！ - 我知道，我真是个笨蛋
- Oh, my God. - I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

181
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,880
当她一个礼拜见四、五次牙医 我就该知道了
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.

182
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,250
谁的牙齿需要这么干净？
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

183
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,840
我哥哥正在克服这种事呢 他真是一团糟
My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.

184
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,680
你是怎么克服的？
How did you get through it?

185
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,390
他可以试着砸烂她的一些贵重的东西
He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,140
- 比如她的… - 腿？
- Say her... - Leg?

187
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,220
那样也可以！
Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.

188
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,310
我则是砸了她的手表
Me, I went for the watch.

189
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,650
你真的砸了她的手表？
- You actually broke her watch? - Mm.

190
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,360
巴瑞，对不起，对不起
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

191
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,530
我知道你可能认为和那天我对你说 跟你穿袜子做爱有关，但不是的
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.

192
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,530
这和我有关，我只是…
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

193
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,630
嘿，机器又把电话挂断了 不管怎样…
Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...

194
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,510
知道什么最吓人的吗？ 如果每个人只有一个女人适合他呢？
You know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?

195
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,050
我是说 如果你得到一个女人，就这样
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?

196
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,100
不幸的是，以我的例子来讲 是她…得到一个女人
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.

197
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,810
你在说什么？ 〝一个女人〞？
What are you talking about? One woman.

198
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,020
那就好像你只吃一种口味的冰淇淋
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.

199
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,940
让我告诉你，罗斯 还有很多种口味
Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.

200
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,570
有碎糖口味、饼干口味 然后还有香草口味
There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,700
还可以加糖条、果仁 或者鲜奶油一起吃！
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

202
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,620
这是你一生中最棒的时刻了！
This is the best thing that ever happened to you.

203
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,670
你难道是八岁结婚的？
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

204
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,630
欢迎回到现实里！拿起汤匙！
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,340
我真不知道我是饿了 还是饥渴
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

206
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,180
离我的冰箱远点！
Then stay out of my freezer.

207
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,350
从她离开我之后，我…
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

208
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,650
怎么啦？
What? What?

209
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,650
你想边吃面条边讲出来？
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

210
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,440
不，这本该在和你 第五次约会时才能说出来的
No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.

211
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,280
噢，所以会有第五次约会罗？
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,490
会有吗？
Isn't there?

213
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,870
我觉得会有
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

214
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,420
你要说什么？
What were you gonna say?

215
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,170
好吧
Well... Er, uh...

216
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,550
自从她离开我之后…
Ever since she left me, um...

217
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,970
我就一直…
...I haven't been able to perform...

218
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,430
无法行房
...sexually.

219
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,810
天啊，对不起
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...

220
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,230
- 对不起… - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

221
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,850
被人吐水应该不是你现在需要的
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

222
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,730
唔…
Um...

223
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,190
多久了？
How long?

224
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,820
两年
Two years.

225
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,280
哇！
Wow!

226
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,410
我真高兴你砸了她的手表！
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

227
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,790
那你还希望有第五次约会吗？
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

228
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,330
是的
Yeah.

229
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,340
是的，我希望
Yeah, I do.

230
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,880
我乔安妮接受查理斯为我的合法丈夫
I, Joanie, take you, Charles, as my lawful husband.

231
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,470
- 你是否接受乔安妮… - 看吧
MINISTER: Do you take Joanie...? - Oh! See.

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,850
可是乔安妮爱佳奇！就是这里不同！
But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.

233
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,770
〝拿起汤匙〞
"Grab a spoon."

234
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,600
你知道我多久没拿汤匙了吗？
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

235
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,940
〝比利，别逞英雄〞 这句话对你有没有意义？
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?

236
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,700
是这样的，就算我想…
You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...

237
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,410
约一个女人出来
...to ask a woman out...

238
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,290
我该约谁？
...who am I gonna ask?

239
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,980
是不是很不可思议？
Isn't this amazing?

240
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,480
我以前从来没泡过咖啡
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.

241
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,150
- 是很不可思议 - 恭喜你
- That is amazing. - Congratulations.

242
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,070
你现在刚好有心情 有没有想做个蛋饼之类的东西…
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...

243
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,450
不过我还不太饿…
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.

244
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,700
- 早安 - 早安
- Good morning. MONICA: Good morning.

245
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,500
- 早安  - 早安
- Morning.  - JOEY: Morning.

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,580
- 早安 - 早安，保罗
- Morning. JOEY: Morning, Paul.

247
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,960
- 你好，保罗 - 嘿，是保罗，对吗？
- Hello, Paul. - Hi. Paul, is it?

248
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,840
我昨晚很开心
MONICA: I had a really great time last night.

249
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,890
谢谢你!太感谢你了!
PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much.

250
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,470
- 再聊 - 好的
- We'll talk later, okay? - Yeah.

251
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,980
谢谢
Thank you.

252
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,610
那不是真正的约会！
That wasn't a real date.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
那你真正的约会都在干什么？
What the hell do you do on a real date?

254
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,500
- 闭嘴，把我的桌子搬回去 - 好的！
- Shut up and put my table back. JOEY: Okay.

255
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,540
好啦，孩子们，我要去工作啦
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

256
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,250
不过如果我不把那些数字输入 也不会有什么差别
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.

257
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,430
你们都有工作吗？
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

258
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,890
对，我们都有
Yeah, we all have jobs.

259
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,720
这样我们才有钱买东西
See, that's how we buy stuff.

260
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,640
对，我是演员
Yeah, I'm an actor.

261
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,060
哇，我有见过你的作品吗？
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

262
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,610
哦，应该没有，大部分是地方性节目
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

263
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,400
等等，除非你看过 翻拍的《木偶奇遇记》
Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

264
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,200
〝瞧，老木匠，我是个真正的小男孩〞
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

265
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,740
别这样羞辱我
I will not take this abuse.

266
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,910
没错，对不起
You're right. I'm sorry.

267
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,040
我曾经是个小木偶…
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy

268
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,460
你今天怎么样？睡得好吗？
MONICA: So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?

269
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,010
和巴瑞谈过吗?我无法停止微笑
Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

270
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,680
看得出来，就好像你睡觉时 有个衣架在你嘴里
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

271
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,400
我知道，他只是太…
I know. He's just so...

272
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,110
你还记得你和托尼多马哥吗？
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
- 是的，记得 - 就好像那样，但有感觉
- Oh, yeah. - Well, it's like that. With feelings.

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,860
哇，你有麻烦了
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

275
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,330
好，我要醒过来，去工作
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up, go to work...

276
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,200
而且不要整天想着他
...and not think about him all day.

277
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,330
或者只是站起来去工作
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

278
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,130
- 喔，祝我好运！ - 为什么？
- Oh, wish me luck! - What for?

279
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,630
我要去找工作之类的事
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

280
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,220
嘿，摩妮卡！ 嘿，弗兰妮，欢迎回来！
- Hey, Monica. - Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

281
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,890
佛罗里达怎么样？
How was Florida?

282
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,390
你跟人上床了，对吧？
You had sex, didn't you?

283
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
你怎么知道的
How do you do that?

284
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,230
- 那么，是和谁？ - 你认识保罗吗？
- So, who? - You know Paul?

285
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,360
保罗，红酒达人？
Paul, the wine guy?

286
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,110
是的，我认识保罗
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

287
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,160
你认识他就好像我认识他一样？
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?

288
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,660
你开玩笑吧？保罗还欠我人情呢
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

289
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,960
在我之前，他两年都无法行房
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

290
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,760
那当然是谎言！
Of course it was a line.

291
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,840
为什么？为什么有人会做这样的事情？
Why? Why would anybody do something like that?

292
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,300
我想更精确的答案是
We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:

293
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,390
〝为了和你上床〞
"To get you into bed."

294
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,020
是因为我吗？
Is it me?

295
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,730
是因为我会散发某种信号吗？
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...

296
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,520
只有狗和有感情问题的男人 才会成应到？
...and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

297
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,650
好啦，过来这里，把你的脚给我
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

298
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,990
我只是以为他是个好人
I just thought he was nice, you know?

299
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,330
我真不敢相信 你不知道那是谎言！
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

300
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,250
猜猜怎么样？
Guess what.

301
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,210
- 你找到工作啦？ - 开玩笑吗？
- You got a job? - Are you kidding?

302
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,050
我一点经验都没有！
I'm trained for nothing.

303
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,930
我今天被十二个面试员嘲笑
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

304
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,640
而且你还这么高兴
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

305
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,350
你也会高兴的 如果你发现名牌皮靴特价…
Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale...

306
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,270
打五折！
...50 percent off.

307
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,270
是呀，你真了解我…
Oh, how well you know me.

308
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,360
这双是 〝我不需要工作，我不需要父母
They're my new "I don't need a job or my parents.

309
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,780
我买了新皮靴〞的皮靴！
I've got great boots" boots.

310
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,360
- 你用什么付帐的？ - 信用卡
- How'd you pay for them? - Uh, credit card.

311
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,570
那谁付帐单呢？
And who pays for that?

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,330
我爸爸
Um, my father.

313
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,080
你不能靠你爸爸过一辈子
You can't live off your parents your whole life.

314
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,960
我知道，这就是为什么我要结婚
I know that. That's why I was getting married.

315
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
别逼她，第一次独立生活是很困难的
Give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time.

316
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,010
- 谢谢你 - 别客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

317
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,890
记得我第一次来这个城市 我才十四岁
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.

318
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,930
我妈妈刚自杀 我的继父又进了监狱
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.

319
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,140
然后在这里我不认识任何人
And I got here, and I didn't know anybody.

320
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,690
然后我和一个在港务局 给人擦车窗的…
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields...

321
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,650
白化病人住在一起 最后他也自杀了
...outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself.

322
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,240
然后我找到按摩这份工作 所以相信我，我完全了解你的感受
And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

323
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,120
你想说的话是：
The word you're looking for is:

324
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,950
〝总之…〞
"Anyway..."

325
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,250
好了，准备好了吗？
All right. You ready?

It sucks. You're gonna love it.

332
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,780
好啦，够啦 你要在沙发上睡？

那是保罗的手表
That's Paul's watch.

338
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,670
你就把它放回原处吧
You can just put it back where you found it.

339

我曾暗恋过你

没错
ALL: Yes.

369
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
有人要咖啡吗？
WOMAN: Would anybody like more coffee?

370
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,180
你泡的，还是你只是端过来？
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

- 只是端过来 - 好吧，我要杯咖啡
