 I saw the man in your freezer .
 You can never tell anyone .
 You bet me in a game of poker ?
 Get out . 
 There will be no kissing , and there will be no wedding .
 You ever wear your hair down ?
 Sometimes .
 Looks really good .
 Thanks .
 Are you embarrassed to be dating me ?
 If Gaby finds out , she 's gonna hit the ceiling .
 Oh , my God . You 're still in love with her .
 In a few months , I will be Mrs. Victor Lang .
 I don 't know my own strength ...
 Thank you .
 - So have you told Bree about your engagement ?
 - Yep .
 She 's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins .
 - You 're kidding .
 - No .
 Damn things traveled 5, 000 miles , and they were still moist .
 I don 't know how she does it .
 Hey , it 's getting late .
 Let 's break out the champagne .
 Wait , wait .
 You 're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast , are you ?
 I 'm not , but Susan 's written a poem .
 A poem ?
 She 's reworked the lyrics to .
 Testing .
 One , two , three , testing .
 What are you waiting for ?
 Get the champagne .
 Okay .
 Thank you .
 Hey , Gaby .
 Hi , Edie !
 So I finally met Victor .
 He is so charming .
 Isn 't he great ?
 I know it 's been quick , but he 's just so amazing .
 So you really love him ?
 He is , and I 've never been happier .
 I am so thrilled for you .
 Edie , are you okay ?
 Oh , yes . Yes , I 'm -- I 'm fine .
 Oh , sweetie .
 Don 't worry . You 're gonna find someone soon .
 I just know it . What ?
 Well , actually , I have found someone .
 And I am ... crazy about him .
 Well , who is it ? 
 Oh , no . No , no .
 Tonight is about you .
 Oh , no , no , Edie .
 Come on .
 It would make me happy to know who 's making you happy .
 - Really ?
 - Yeah !
 I wanna know who 's putting that dopey grin on your face .
 Well , actually , it 'S ... Carlos .
 Who ?
 Carlos .
 I 've been seeing Carlos .
 And this is how Gabrielle Solis came to be injured the night of her engagement party .
 And though she seemed to laugh it off ,
 Gabrielle had been cut much , much deeper than anyone could see .
 Greg is definitely off the wagon . Last week ...
 That mailman was in sarah 's house over an hour .
 Packages weren 't all he 's delivering .
 I could smell the whiskey on Amy 's breath . 
 It wasn 't even noon yet . 
 Joanne may say that she was off on a religious retreat , but since when does praying make your boobs bigger ?
 What kind of woman would keep her husband 's body in the freezer ?
 For ten years ? It 's crazy .
 Has anybody talked to her ?
 I 've knocked twice .
 She 's not answering .
 Oh , I saw the curtain move .
 I think I saw a hand .
 Oh , great . Now we know she 's watching us .
 Why should we be embarrassed ?
 We 're not the ones who kept a corpsicle in the basement .
 Oh , that 's right .
 She babysat your kids .
 Oh , please , I don 't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement .
 I mean , jeez , if you want to keep your husband on ice , at least have a dedicated freezer .
 Do you think she actually killed him ?
 Uh , yeah .
 Why else would she have hid the body ?
 Well , so far , she 's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse .
 But once they defrost the body and do an autopsy , I guarantee you they 're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic .
 What 's arsenic ?
 It 's just -- it 's something yucky , honey .
 Go play with your balls . Go on .
 We 're trying so hard to protect them from this .
 There are just some things that kids don 't need to know about .
 Hell , there 's some things we don 't need to know about .

 Would you guys excuse me ?

 Hey , Edie ! Oh , hi , Gaby !
 What 's up ?
 I 've been doing some thinking , and you know how ... how do I put this ?
 You know how you feel like sometimes people hate you ?
 I don 't feel like that .
 We , you should , 'cause they do . Since when ? Since you started doing things to piss people off .
 About what ? Oh , I don 't know .
 Off the top of my head ... dating your friends ' exes .
 Oh .
 Oh , so that big smile on your face the other night was all an act .
 You 're not fine with me seeing Carlos .
 Edie , there are a thousand single men in Fairview . Why do you have to date my ex- husband ? You 're engaged to somebody else !
 What do you care ? It 's awkward !
 It 's -- it 's like if I donated a dress to charity , and I went to a party , and you showed up wearing it .
 Again , if you gave it away in the first place , then what the hell are you bitching about ?
 Look , Edie , just find your own men and stop snapping up other people 's castoffs !
 And what if I don 't ?

 Then be prepared to suffer the consequences .
 Oh , please .
 You are as tall as my legs .
 What are you gonna do ?
 You 're about to find out .


 Who is it this time ?
 Um ... it 's Ian .
 You gonna talk to him ? No .
 Uh , he 's got flowers . I don 't care .
 Looks like it 's two dozen roses .
 Oh , good . I hope the thorns rip him to shreds .
 Okay , Mom , I know what Mike and Ian did was wrong , but --
 They bet me in a game of poker . They made decisions about my life over a hand of 5- card stud . " Wrong " does not even begin to cover it .


 Okay , okay , but there are only two guys in this world who know all of your flaws and have still found a way to love you .
 You 're just gonna toss 'em both away ? Yes . I don 't need a man .
 I don 't even need sex .
 I went without it the first 16 years ...
 22 years of my life , and I can go a few more .


 This should be interesting . What ?
 Mike just walked up .

 Give it up .
 She didn 't answer the first ten times . She 's not gonna answer it now .


 Oh , this is getting sad .
 Take it like a brit -- stiff upper lip . You know what ?
 I 've just about bloody had it with you .
 I preferred you when you were comatose and pooping in a bag !
 Well , lucky for you , I don 't have that bag right now .

 All right , that does it .

 Uh , excuse me ?
 Guys ? Hi . Um , my mom would really like for both of you to leave .

 Don 't soft- pedal it . Let 'em know I mean business .
 Uh , 'cause if you -- if you don 't , she 'll be very , very disappointed . Rip 'em !
 So just , um ... go home and think about what you 've done .
 If you want something bitchier , do it yourself !
 Here we are -- ravioli stuffed with duck confit in a porcini cream sauce .
 What do you think ?
 I think it 's a shame you didn 't make any for yourself .


 Hi , honey .
 Hey , I just wanted to say I love you .
 Aren 't you sweet ?

 What 's that noise in the background ?
 Are the boys still up ? Yeah , they don 't want to go to bed .
 Well , of course they don 'T . They 're kids . You 're the dad .
 Make 'em . Well , I tried , honey , but they wanna wait up for you .
 They ... they miss their mom .
 Ah , is this your way of guilting me into coming back home ?
 Lynette , the -- the restaurant did close a half- hour ago .
 Preston , don 't throw pudding ! Oh , Tom ...
 I 'm sorry .
 I can 't come home .
 We 're , um ... doing inventory , so ... it could be a while .
 Well , okay . - Try to hurry ?
 - I will . I love you . Bye .
 Inventory ?
 I know . I 'm a horrible person .
 I just chose ravioli over motherhood .

 I should -- I should go home . Lynette , you got nothing to feel guilty about .
 You bust your ass in this restaurant every day to keep it going , and if anybody deserves a little downtime , it 's you .
 Those are shameless rationalizations .
 Keep them coming .

 Those , too .

 There you are .
 What are you doing outside ?
 Some big kids threw eggs at Mrs. McCluskey 's house .
 Oh , jeez .
 They shouldn 't have done that .
 We should go talk to her .

 No .
 It 's late .
 Uh , she probably doesn 't want us to bother her .
 Come on , bud .
 Bedtime .



 So here 's what 's gonna happen -- we 're not talking to Edie anymore .
 What do you mean , " we " ?
 I mean , " we " as in she betrayed me , and you 're my best friends , so you 're gonna support me because that 's what friends do .
 And " support you " means ... acting like we 're in junior high ?
 I can 't believe you 're not furious at this .
 Before she sank her fangs into Carlos , she was dating your ex- husband and Mike .
 Yes , and do you know who I blame ?
 I blame Karl and Mike .
 Why isn 't anybody mad at them ? I mean , let 's face it . The men -- they get away with murder .

 They 're scum ! Okay . Back to Edie ...
 I 'm not sure I 'm comfortable ganging up on her .
 Really ?
 Because I wasn 't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with Patty Monroe over the backyard fence line , but I did .
 Oh , Gaby , that 's not fair .
 Nobody really liked Patty to begin with .
 Don 't even get me started about what I 've done for you , okay ?
 I 'm still boycotting Madame Kim 's day spa because of your botched bikini wax .
 Oh , my God .
 How do you botch a bikini wax ? She will show you later !
 The point is , good friends share more than just gossip and brunch . They share enemies , too .
 So are you with me or not ?

 Of course we 're with you .
 We will give Edie the cold shoulder .
 No , no !
 Not cold , frozen !
 I want icicles hanging from that bitch 's ears !

 Hello ?
 Hi .
 Hey , do you still want me to look at that book report ?
 Daddy helped me yesterday .
 You weren 't home .
 Oh .
 Okay . Daddy does everything lately .
 How come you always come home so late ?
 Well , I 'm really busy at the restaurant .
 Believe me , I come home to daddy just as soon as I can .
 You 're lying .
 What ?
 You always laugh like that when you 're telling a lie .

 why would you say that ?
 Because ... it 's true .
 I stay late because there 's a lot of work to do , and right now I 'm the only person who can do it , and now I have to go to the grocery store because I am the only person who can do that , mm- hmm .
 So why don 't you go upstairs and finish your homework ?
 Okay .
 But it is what you do .




 Excuse me !
 Uh , hey ! Excuse me . That 's my space !
 Yeah , well , I 'm parked in it , so that kind of makes it my space .
 Hey , uh , I waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth .
 You can 't just steal it .
 It 's a parking space ! Keep a lid on your hormones , honey .


 God !
 You did that on purpose !
 Yeah , and I 'm about to do this on purpose , too .
 Crazy bitch !
 What do you think you 're doing ? !
 What are you doing ?
 What are you doing ? ! I 'm taking my damn space !
 Get out of my car . Get out of my car . Hey , hey .
 Say you 're sorry . - Let me go ! - Say it !
 Okay , okay . I 'm sorry .
 Say , " I 'm a rude , arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect ! "
 I 'm a rude , arrogant ... how does the rest of it go ?
 Freeze !
 Was this man trying to steal your car ? It 's my car !
 She -- she tripped me and grabbed my keys .
 Is this true , Ma 'am ?
 Oh , all right , take his side !



 Hey , who you spying on ?
 Lynette . She hasn 't returned my last two phone calls .
 I think something 's up .
 She 's probably just busy .
 Yeah , we 'll see about that .
 I am calling her right ... now .


 Oh , my God !
 What ? She just screened me !
 I have been screened !
 Maybe she 's in a hurry .
 No , no , no .
 This has Gabrielle Solis written all over it .
 She is turning people against me . And you 're surprised ?
 I told you how she 'd react if she found out about us .
 Yeah ?
 Well , if she wants to play these schoolgirl games , fine .
 ' Cause I invented 'em .






 Lynette !
 Hi ! Hey , hey ! I just tried calling you .
 Oh , really ? My ringer must 've been off .
 Oh , no prob .
 I wanted to invite you and the boys to Travers ' birthday party on saturday .
 Yeah , I 'm having this reptile guy , and he 's got all these cool snakes and lizards .
 The boys would love that , but unfortunately , I gotta work . Oh ! Well , that 's a shame , because I was hoping you could cater .

 Cater ?
 Yeah , I 'm gonna need pastas and salads for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids .
 Wow , that many ?
 Yeah , and ... well , you know kids . If one has a pizza party , they 're all gonna want a pizza party .
 Hmm , could be good for business .

 Well , yeah , I guess I could work somethin ' out .
 Oh , I knew I could count on you ! Mm !
 Love ya !

 Look , whatever that court report says ,
 I do not have " anger issues . "
 I was just having a bad day . You threatened to decapitate a man over a parking space .
 A very bad day .
 Susan , when someone loses it like you did , there 's usually a reason .
 Are things going okay at work ?
 Work is great .
 You could just sign that paper and tell the judge I 'm fine .
 What about your family ?
 Family 's terrific .
 Seriously , you 're just wasting your time here .
 How 's your love life ?


 Cancel my lunch .
 I 'm gonna be here for a while .


 Will you stop ringing that damn ...
 I 'm sorry , Parker .
 I thought you were one of those little pissants who keep ringing the bell and running away .
 So what 's on your mind ? I want you to come back and babysit us .
 The new sitter stinks . Your folks hired a new sitter ?
 Yeah , and she thinks carrot sticks are snacks .
 Well , that 's rough , but ... life 's like that sometimes .
 It doesn 't have to be .
 If you just told people what happened with your husband , everything could go back to the way it was .
 Parker , you see those women over there ?
 Nothing I could say would stop those tongues from wagging .
 I 'm sorry , kid , but ...
 I just have to wait this one out .


 Can you imagine ? !
 I mean , finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game .
 I mean , how demeaning is that ? ! Well , it depends on how you look at it .
 Men have been waging contests over women for centuries .
 I grant you , poker isn 't as romantic as , say , jousting , but it shows how they felt about you . the real question is how did you feel about them ?
 I told you -- hurt and betrayed . No , how did you feel about them before this poker business ?
 Well ...
 I was engaged to Ian , so ... obviously I loved him .
 And Mike ?
 Were you in love with him , too ? - How are we doing on time ?
 - Susan . Okay , fine , I loved him .
 I still love him , and I love Ian .
 So I am totally , hopelessly in love with two men . Now we 're getting somewhere .
 This is good . No , this is horrible !
 This wasn 't supposed to happen !
 I only let myself fall for Ian 'cause I thought Mike was lost to me . And then bang !
 Suddenly he wants me back , and now I have this choice that I can 't possibly make . - I agree . It 's tough - - It 's devastating !
 If I go with Mike , Ian 's heart will be broken , and Ian does not deserve that .
 But how can I reject Mike after all he 's been through ?
 So you 're just gonna walk away from both of them ? You have to make a choice , sweetie .
 You 've got two great guys , both of them crazy about you .
 To let one go -- well , that 's life . It happens .
 To let them both go ... that 's just ...
 - Stupid ?
 - Yes . That would be the clinical term .
 Sounds great . Thanks .

 Hey , how would you like to eat something that 's neither pasta nor pizza ?
 Such food exists ? Don 't tease me .
 No , my -- my friend Al , he 's opening a soul food place ...
 And Sunday night , he wants to test the menu with some of his chef buddies .
 He said I could bring someone . And -- and -- and you want me to go with you ?
 It 'll be after we close .
 And don 't tell me that you hate southern food , 'cause then we can 't be friends .
 No , I love it .
 It 's ... it 's just that 's a little late for me , and ...
 Oh , oh , oh . Okay . I- I just thought it 'd be fun .
 No , it would be , but Sunday nights are kind of crazy .
 I 'm packing lunches and checking homework ...
 Right , right .
 No worries .
 I get it . You 're just , uh , first person I thought of .

 You know , maybe I should go .
 Um ... it 's part of the job to check out the competition , right ?
 Yeah , absolutely .
 It never hurts to see what else is out there .
 I agree .




 Hey , guys , go check out the snakes .
 I 'll give you some pizza later , okay ? - See you later .
 - All right , I 'll see you later . - Hey , you want some pizza ? - Yeah .
 There you go .
 Lynette ! What are you doing here ?
 Edie asked me to cater .
 I know , I 'm a total whore , but please don 't rat me out to Gaby .
 Hi , Susan !
 I have 30 copies of your book . The kids can 't wait for you to sign it .
 Come on , let 's go ! Come on , come on !
 Looks like we 're working the same corner .
 Yeah , only I didn 't know Edie was gonna have the party in a park . - What if Gaby see us ?
 - Trust me , we can both relax .
 I talked to her this morning , and she 's out with Victor all day .
 Oh .
 Well , that 's a relief .

 Go ahead .
 I dare ya .




 Hey ! what 's going on ?
 " Witch "
 - Hey , don 't do that ! - Why not ?
 - Because she 's not a witch . - How do you know ? ' Cause she isn 'T .
 Don 't be a jerk .
 What is she , your girlfriend ? Parker 's in love !
 Shut up !
 Hey , you boys ! Knock it off !
 Parker , I 'm so sorry .
 Are you all right ?
 You know , everything would be okay if you 'd tell people what you told me .
 You can make 'em stop .


 Hey , Lynette , it 's Gaby .
 Victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter . So I 'm free for lunch . You wanna go with ?
 I tried Susan but she 's not home , which is weird because her car 's in the driveway and ... so is yours .
 Where is everybody ?




 Down ! Down ! Down !
 Aah !
 Lynette , what is wrong with you ? !
 - Gaby 's coming .
 - What ? ! I thought you said she was with Victor . I was wrong .
 I was wrong . Come on . Follow me .
 Follow me .
 Mommy , can I play ? No !
 Go ride the python !
 Come on . " Rent A Reptile "

 Okay , okay , she 's circling the park .
 Ugh . I wish she 'd hurry . I 'm terrified of snakes .
 Oh , yeah , I 'm more terrified of Gaby .
 Okay , good , good .
 - We 're almost home free ...
 - What ?
 Don 't turn around .





 Lynette ! Susan ! - Hey , Gab .
 - Hi . What are you two doing here ? Uh , what are we doing here ?
 Well , Edie hired me to cater , so it 's just business .
 I don 't know what her excuse is .
 You are so dead . I don 't believe it .
 This is an absolute betrayal of our friendship .
 Gaby , she asked me to make 20 pizzas . I couldn 't turn it down .
 Oh , this is so delicious .
 Is that what our friendship is worth to you -- 20 pizzas ?
 - We had a pact ! - Oh , come on , Gaby , be fair .
 You put us in a really awkward position .
 - Me ? ! You two owe me an apology .
 - No , Gaby , be reasonable .
 I am leaving this party right now , and if you two don 't come with me , - our friendship is over .
 - Gaby !
 Oh , come on ! - What ? ! - Oh !
 No , I mean it .
 Carlos , stop !
 Put me down ! What are you doing ? !
 Stop it !
 Carlos , put me down !
 How dare you maul me like that ! You were ruining Travers ' birthday party .
 What the hell is wrong with you ? !
 I 'm sorry . Betrayal makes me a little cranky .
 Come on , Gaby , you can 't tell Susan and Lynette who they 're allowed to be friends with .
 - I 'll tell you what 's ridiculous : you not having the guts to tell me you were dating Edie .
 - It 's ridiculous .
 Oh , here it is .
 Yeah .
 I had to find out from her at my damn engagement party .
 Well , I had to hear that you were engaged to that Victor guy on the news .
 I didn 't plan it that way .
 It was spur of the moment .
 Oh , so you just said , hey , what the heck ?
 - You even in love with this guy ? - Yes , deeply .


 Must be nice . Well , aren 't you in love with Edie ?
 We 're having fun together , but it 'll never be serious .
 So ... if I 'm just dating , and you 're in love and getting married ... remind me again why it is that you get to be the angry one .
 I 'm sorry , Carlos . You should be .


 Hey ! Hey .

 Feel free to take home as much cake as you want . I do not want to be tempted . I might take a little for Tom and ...

 Hi , Mrs. McCluskey .
 Would you like some cake ? I didn 't come for sweets .
 I know you people have been talking about me , and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean .
 So ... who would like to hear the gruesome details ? - I would .
 - Um ... yeah . If -- if you feel like it . Well ... first off -- and I know this will disappoint some of you -- but I didn 't kill Gilbert .

 I came home from a weekend in Laughlin and found him in front of the TV -- dead .
 He still had the remote in his hand . Good Lord .
 It was 2 : 00 a . m . , so I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home .
 And I went to his desk to make sure everything was in order .
 I found his pension plan ... and guess what ?
 In the event of his death , I was not the beneficiary .
 - Who was ? - His first wife .
 They were married when he started the job -- for two years .
 We were together for 34 years , and that idiot didn 't change the paperwork .
 I not only lost my Gilbert , but I was about to lose everything .
 So I , um ...
 I , um ... you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks .
 Well , what else was I gonna do ?
 Besides , after a while , it was kind of nice having him around .
 Anyway ... that 's the truth .
 You ladies have my permission to pass it along ... not that some of you ladies need it .


 Probably weren 't expecting to see me , huh ?
 Well , after 20 unanswered calls ... no , not really .
 About that , uh , obviously , have been very confused .
 I finally saw a therapist .
 Actually , it was sort of a court- ordered thing . Anyway ...
 Well , I need to talk to you .

 You sound ... sure .
 I am .
 I 'm gonna marry Ian .
 Believe me , this wasn 't easy , especially when you started to remember how it was between us .
 Maybe if the timing had been different ... it wasn 't .
 I 'm sorry , Mike .
 Well , at least I have my memories .



 - You ready to go ?
 - Yeah .
 Um , I told Kim that we 'd be out the rest of the evening , and she 's gonna lock up .
 - Great .
 I 'll , uh , just get my jacket . - Okay .

 Hey !
 You got a table for seven ? - Hey ! - Hi !
 What are you doing here ?
 Well , the kids wanted to surprise you , and it 's been forever since we 've all had dinner together , so ... what -- well , how did you get here ?
 I mean , you 're not supposed to ... drive .
 I took a cab , a double- dose of the painkillers , and voilà .
 - You surprised ?
 - Yeah , a little .
 We missed you .
 Oh , I missed you , too . Hey , why don 't you guys go grab that big table , and I will have Rick whip something up for us ?

 Hi . Wow , you smell good .
 Oh . It must be the basil .
 It has a kind of sweet smell .
 Hey , Kayla , can you get a ... high chair for your sister , please ?
 - Yeah . - All right , who wants pizza ? Oh , hi .
 Uh , change of plans . Yeah .
 Yeah , I see .
 But ...
 I 'm sorry .
 You could still go .
 Oh , no .
 No , no .
 I 'll stay .
 I 'll cook for your family .
 Thanks . Thank you .


 Thanks , sweetie .
 You are taking such good care of me .
 When 's Lynette getting home ?
 Oh , as soon as she closes up the pizzeria . Mm .
 Is that guy Rick helping her ? He better be , for as much as we 're paying him .
 I think Lynette likes him .
 Sure .
 He 's a nice guy , hard worker .
 No , I mean , she likes him , likes him .

 What makes you say that ?
 Just something I noticed .
 Well , good night , Daddy .

 Mrs. Susan Hainsworth -- God , I love the sound of that .
 Or did you want to keep your name ?
 Because I love the sound of that , too . As long as I get to call you my wife .
 Deal .
 You do realize we 're gonna be blissfully happy , don 't you ?
 I mean , it could actually get a bit disgusting .
 People might throw fruit .
 Oh , I 'm gonna lock up down here .
 Why don 't you go upstairs and warm up the bed ?
 You do realize we 're gonna be great together , don 't you ?
 I know .

 Hey , Susan .
 Um , I don 't mean to bug you . There 's just so much I didn 't get to say .
 Um , I ... God , I 'm lousy at good- byes .
 Anyway , you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me , and , well , I hope you find the happiness you deserve .
 Bye .
 Oh , this is Mike .

 Hey , Susan . Um , I don 't mean to bug you . There 's just so much I didn 't get to say .
 Um , I ... God , I 'm lousy at good- byes .
 Anyway , you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me , and , well ,
 I hope you find the happiness you deserve .
 Bye .
 Oh , this is Mike .

 Where are you going ?
 Home ... to England .
 To England ?
 What 's wrong ? Well , it 's just , um ...
 I don 't think this is going to work . What ?
 But just ten minutes ago , we were making plans , and you were saying how great we were gonna be together .
 I , uh , saw you listening to that message from Mike .


 Well , Ian , I made my choice .
 But not for the right reasons .
 You 're just trying to honor a promise you made to me .
 That 's not true .
 I will get over him .
 You 've been trying to get over him for as long as I 've known you .
 Haven 't had much luck , have you ?
 Ian , I love you .
 I know you do .
 But you love him a little bit more , don 't you ?

 I can 't live a life where every time I see you with a faraway look ,
 I 'll wonder if you 're thinking of him .
 I 'm so sorry .
 You deserve to be happy .
 And so do I.
 Good- bye , Susan .



 Hey , Mrs. McCluskey .
 Lynette . Well , it turns out our new babysitter isn 't working out too well .
 Feel up to another tour of duty ?
 Are you sure you want the Wisteria witch looking after your kids ? My kids know you 're not a witch .
 Too bad .
 I could use the leverage .
 We missed you .
 Same here .
 I 'm gonna need a raise , though .
 I 'm kinda strapped . Okay .

 I just talked to Mrs. McCluskey , and she is gonna start looking after our kids again .
 - That 's great ! - Yeah .
 ' Cause actually , I have been thinking , and ... it is time that I got back to work .
 - What ?
 - Yep . I 'm feeling good . I 'm gettin ' around better .
 But ... but the doctor said your recovery would take months , and it 's only been six weeks .
 Well , it 's not like I 'm gonna , you know , dead- lift a bag of ice , but I can sprinkle cheese on a pizza .
 Mm .
 Besides ... I hate making you run that place by yourself .
 - I don 't mind . - Really ?
 Because before , you said it was killing you .
 Yeah , well , you know , it is , but I just don 't want you to come back before you 're ready .
 You might reinjure yourselF . I 'll be careful . The best part is we can finally get Rick off the books .
 Rick ? Why would we want to let him go ?
 Well , I know he 's been great , but , um , his salary is cutting into our profits .
 Actually , he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary .
 I mean , with all those new dishes he 's been cooking , he 's got a lot of fans out there .
 Does he really ? Yeah .
 I think firing him would be a huge mistake .
 Well , it 's just a thought .
 Well , don 't think so much . Just rest and get better . That 's what you need to do .
 You gonna be late tonight ?
 Probably .
 We got a big party coming in at 10 : 00 .
 So ... mm- hmm .
 I 'll just see you in the morning . - I 'll be here .
 - Okay .

 Hi , Ida .
 What 's up ?
 That idiot postman mixed up our mail again . Oh , poor Mr. Henley . He does seem to be getting worse .
 Thanks for stopping by . Hey , have you heard about Mike ? No .
