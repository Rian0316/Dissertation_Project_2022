 00 : 00 : 38, 880 -- > 00 : 00 : 40, 920 - Coach .
 - Yes , Frank ?
 - Where do I go ? - Proceed to the hub .
 Got ya .
 - How will I know who he is ? - This is him .
 Hi .
 Oh , oh .
 Sorry . Fork .
 - Amy . - No , no , my name 's not fork .
 - I guessed . It was just -- - It 's Frank .
 - Do you wanna sit ?
 Shall we sit ? - I think it 's that or stand .
 Come sit , yeah ?
 Oh , oh ! That 's , um ... I was on that side .
 - Oh . Shall I ... ? - No , no , it doesn 't matter .
 Why bring it up ?
 Sorry . I 'm so bloody nervous .
 It 's my first time on the , you know , the system .
 - Me too . - Oh , really ?
 Yeah , I 'm shitting it , mate .
 - Come to mention it , you look terrified . - Do I ?
 - Yeah , quaking with fear .
 - Or maybe shaking with revulsion ?
 At least you stopped ... shitting .
 Oh !
 Are you sure about that ?
 - Shall we stop talking about shitting ?
 - Maybe order some food ? Good plan .
 Yeah . OK .
 - Do you know how we order ? - I think we use these .
 - Oh !
 - Menu choice already established .
 - Oh . Ta . - Here you are , sir .
 And for you , madam .
 Well , evidently I 'm a pasta girl .
 Yeah , I 'm a , uh ... ... fishcake ...
 - Hmm .
 - Mmm .
 - It 's good . - Can I try some ?
 Are we ... allowed to do that ?
 Fuck it .
 Yeah , fuck it .
 - Mm .
 That is good . - Mm- hmm .
 So ... we 're both first- timers .
 Hmm .
 - Shall we check our expiry date ?
 - Yeah , good plan . Yeah ?
 All right , um , so I think it 's under " info . "
 Yeah , uh , " tap to reveal . "
 We have to tap to reveal at the same time .
 OK . So , on three , two , one .
 Go .
 - Twelve hours . - Yeah , 12 hours .
 - OK . - Bit , um ... - Yeah .
 - Bit short .
 - It is a bit short , isn 't it ?
 - Hmm .
 Oh . And getting shorter .
 I didn 't realize it would ... sort of count down like that .
 It 's sort of sad .
 Maybe we should eat quickly .
 - Yeah . Yeah , maybe we should . - The race is on .
 Come on , hurry up .
 I guess this is us .
 And this takes us to the place ?
 Yeah , suppose so .
 - After you .
 - Thank you .
 It 's massive .
 - Here we are . - Yep .
 Huh .
 - Do you wanna open it or shall I ?
 - You go ahead .
 - All right .
 - Ha ! Too slow .
 You 're a knob .
 Oh , God . It 's a shithole .
 - You 're kidding . - I am , yeah .
 Ooh !
 It 's nice . I , uh , like that lamp .
 - Yeah , it 's incredible , that lamp . - Fuck off .
 Hmm .
 Right .
 That 's , uh ...
 There 's an en suite .
 - Shower or bath ? - Both .
 Ah .
 That 's good .
 Uh .
 Well , I 'm ... I 'm just gonna use the loo .
 Yeah , I 've got to , uh ... over here , so ...
 Yeah .
 OK , seriously , what are we meant to do ?
 Query too broad . Please narrow .
 Well , I mean , are we just meant to ...
 I don 't know , like , just go at it ?
 Define " go at it . "
 Fucking hell .
 So , are we meant to just have sex with each other ?
 Participants are not required to take any specific action .
 Yeah , but I mean we can , right ?
 I mean , people do if it 's just a short time ?
 If that 's your decision .
 - It 's up to us ? - It 's up to you .
 I could just sleep here .
 Don 't be daft . You 'll be scrunched up in a ball .
 It 's not awful .
 The bed 's pretty big . I 'm sure we could both fit in it .
 Yeah , OK .
 Must have been mental before the system .
 How do you mean ?
 Well , people had to do the whole relationship thing themselves , work out who they wanna be with .
 Hmm .
 Option paralysis .
 So many choices , you end up not knowing which one you want .
 Yeah , exactly , and if things seem shitty , they 'd have to figure out whether they wanted to break up with someone .
 How to break up with someone . Fuckin ' hell .
 - Just a nightmare . - It 's not like when it 's all mapped out .
 God , no . It 's so much simpler when it 's all mapped out .
 Hmm .
 - This is weird , though .
 - It really is .
 Hmm .
 - Well , then .
 - So ...
 Thanks for being my first .
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 Bloody time .
 It was great , you know . You were nice .
 So were you .
 If we had this time again , you would totally get it , by the way .
 - Oh , you ... You bastard . - Sorry .
 - You 'd get it , too . - Fucked that one up , didn 't we ?
 Yeah , totally .
 I guess I just don 't see the point in something that short .
 Twelve hours .
 Even your reaction to a brief encounter provides the system with valuable information .
 Yeah , well , I didn 't even do anything .
 The system thinks I 'm a prude .
 The system makes no moral judgments .
 Yeah , but how do I know she wasn 't the perfect match for me ?
 She was ...
 Your ultimate compatible other has not yet been selected .
 Yeah , I know , but it 's --
 The system gains insight as each participant progresses through numerous relationships and uses the gathered data to eventually select an ultimate compatible other .

 On your pairing day , I know , and it always finds your perfect match .
 In 99 . 8 % of cases .
 But I have to go through loads of relationships to find it .
 - That is correct . - Great .
 What was that ?
 - Another relationship . - What , already ?
 What 's this , another one ?
 That is correct .
 I 'd best go get changed , then .
 Holy fuck . Tell me that 's him .
 I cannot confirm identity until a personal introduction is made .
 - Hi .
 - Hi .
 Identity confirmed .
 - I like your hair . - Yours is good too .
 It 's all my own .
 It 's just funny .
 Hi .
 I 'm Frank .
 Hmm .
 Nicola .
 I 've been here a while .
 Aye , sorry . I was getting changed .
 - Really ? - You started already ?
 - I was hungry . - Yeah , course , yeah .
 Sorry .
 Come on , let 's get it over with . Checking the expiry .
 Oh !
 Yeah , yeah .
 One year .
 We 've got each other for one year ? Could be a mistake .
 - Coach , is this a mistake ? - This is not a mistake .
 Jesus fucking Christ .
 There 'll be a reason .
 Thanks .
 Look on the bright side . Chicken tikka masala .
 What ?
 Chicken tikka mas -- It 's a joke .
 Right .
 So you 're the sort of person that makes jokes .
 - OK , so on three . - Two , one .
 Oh .
 Interesting .
 Nine months .
 Well ... cheers .
 Cheers .
 Pretty much the same as my last one .
 - How many of these have you had ?
 - Relationships ? So far ?
 Five .
 - Oh . - I 'm an old hand , I suppose .
 Listen , I 'm just gonna jump in the shower .
 - OK . - Won 't be long .
 Hey .
 Hi .
 So , listen , if you 're OK with it , this is relationship five for me , and I 've found it 's best to have sex straight away upfront .
 Right , yeah .
 Kind of breaks the ice , gives an early overview of compatibility and so on .
 Yep .
 So I 'm consenting to everything now .
 Whenever you feel comfortable doing the same --
 Tikka masala .
 Just ...
 - What ? - It 's a bit tikka masala .
 - Oh .
 I 'm sorry . - Talking makes it worse .
 Sorry .
 No , no , you 're gonna have to do it from behind .
 - You what ? - From behind .
 Bit faster ?
 More motion .
 Not like that . More motion . You 're all in out , in out ,
 like you 're trying to shut a drawer into a filing cabinet .
 - Sorry . - It 's just boring .
 Want a bit more side to side .
 Like this ?
 No , not really .
 What was that ?
 - Nothing .
 - Hmm .

 Fucking hell .
 So I can 't just walk away ?
 That is correct .
 One day it will provide you with the ultimate match .
 One day . One day .
 So I 'd just like to say , do have faith in the system , because it does deliver .
 It did for us .
 You have so many experiences , and then one day it pairs you up with your ultimate match , the best in show , as it were .
 Ha .
 So if you 're having doubts , just hang on in there .
 Because it really does work .
 Garlic dip . Thanks for that .
 - Hi .
 Hi .
 - Mm !
 Was that , uh , your ... ?
 - Yeah . Nicola . - Oh .
 Nicola .
 - Hmm .
 - Ha .
 You OK ?
 No , you 're not being ... ? Are you being serious ?
 Oh , my God . OK , this is happening . OK , um , just ...
 Oh .
 Thanks .
 - You look well . - Thanks .
 I 'd return the compliment , but you 've just spat food on my shoe , so ...
 To be fair , it is a revolting shoe , so ...
 All the better to kick you with .
 Was that really hard ?
 - Ouch . - I 'm so sorry . Fuck .
 Shit .
 Oh .
 Oh !
 Um ...
 Uh ...
 Lenny , this is , um , Frank . Frank , this is Lenny .
 - Hi , Lenny . You all right ?
 - Hi .
 We were together for a bit .
 - A small ... small bit . - Yeah , just before we ...
 So you two ... ? Oh . That 's ... that 's great .
 So , I mean ... it looks like you two make a great team .
 Yeah .
 - Yeah . - Um , I 'll see you .
 Yeah .
 - You know that noise you make ? - What noise ?
 - Do I do that ?
 - Yeah , you do , quite often .
 Does it bother you ?
 A bit , yeah .
 - I 'll try not to . - OK .




 So it 's been great , really .
 - Shame it has to end . - But end it must .
 Anyway ...
 OK , bye .
 Another partner already ?
 That is correct .
 So , three , two , one , go .
 Thirty- six hours ?
 Well , uh ... bye .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 Three , two , one .


 - I just wanna say -- - Don 't .
 Well , I learned what it 's like to cohabit with someone I despise .
 - Is that useful for the system ?
 - Everything happens for a reason .
 That 's sooner than I expected .
 - Hello , you .
 - Hi .
 Hi .
 Is this right ?
 - Yeah . - I mean ...
 Yeah , I didn 't think the system would hook us up again .
 No , me neither .
 I mean , I hope it 's right , obviously , but ...
 - Coach , are we sat at the right table ?
 - Yes , that is correct .
 OK , well ...
 Wait , um ... Can we not check the expiry date ?
 - Uh ...
 Why ? - Just sick of it .
 The system 's just bounced me from bloke to bloke , short fling after short fling .
 I know they 're short flings , they 're just meaningless , and I get really detached .
 It 's like I 'm not really there .
 So the other week , I was with this guy , God knows who , basically just a haircut .
 And I literally had this out- of- body experience .
 I wandered out of my body , and I sat in this chair across the room and I watched myself fucking this guy .
 And I was , like , what is that all about ?
 That is literally just a dick going in and out of a hole .
 Yeah , that 's pretty detached .
 When it 's a long- term thing , it 's just as bad , watching the clock like you 're a prisoner , counting the hours , the minutes .
 - Oh , God , I 've been there . - Yeah .
 - Yeah , let 's not check the expiry , then . - Yeah .
 - It 's a deal . - Deal .
 - OK .
 - Bring on les fishcake .
 I don 't know .
 - So ? - So ...
 - Might as well . - I suppose we have to .
 - Don 't know how much time we 've got .
 - Yeah , it could be ten minutes .
 - Think you could last ten minutes ? - Fuck off .
 All right . OK , then .
 Wait . One of us should get undressed first .
 - Why only one of us ? - It 'll be funny .
 Go on then . Get your kit off .
 No . No , it was my idea .
 All right .
 This is kind of emasculating .
 Well , then , you 'd better make up for it in a minute .
 ♪ I 'm gonna see your dick ♪
 Sorry .
 - ♪ I 'm gonna fucking see it ♪ - Yeah , OK .
 Yeah --
 What if there is no scrutiny , it 's just putting us together in any old order , and we all go along with it 'cause they 're always telling us how clever it is ?

 Yeah , but it does put people with the one .
 It 's got a 99 . 8 % success rate .
 But how do you know they 're perfect matches ?
 I mean , what if all it 's actually doing is gradually wearing us down , putting us in one relationship after another for random durations in a random sequence ?
 Each time you get a little bit more pliable , a little bit more broken , until eventually it coughs up the final offering and says that 's the one .

 And by that point you are so defeated and so exhausted that you just accept it , you settle .
 And then you have to live the rest of your life convincing yourself you didn 't .
 Well done . That 's one of the bleakest things I 've ever heard .
 Thank you .
 Right . Do you wanna know my theory ?
 Let 's assume the system isn 't random .
 - It 's as sophisticated as they say it is . - OK .
 Right , so using these , it slurps up all your reactions , yeah ?
 - It builds up a complex profile .
 - Mm- hmm .
 Every crazy thought you 've ever had , all your dreams and your weaknesses and --
 - And your mad theories . - Yeah , like , everything in your head .
 - Right . - So if it 's everything in your head ...
 - does it have thoughts ? - All right , so now you 're gonna say :
 " What if that 's us and we 're stuck in a simulation ? "
 Well , how would we know ?
 I think that settles it .
 I might have been programmed to go " Ow . "
 OK .
 - Hey , come here .
 - No .
 - Coach ? - Hello , Frank .
 - I 've gotta know . - What would you like to know ?
 The expiry date for me and Amy . I need to know how long .
 You 're not gonna talk me out of it ?
 Would you like me to talk you out of it ?
 Yeah . Uh ... No .
 I ...
 Don 't know .

 No , I 'm not gonna do it . I said I wouldn 't .
 We shook on it .
 Fuck it .

 Recalibrating .
 Coach ?
 - Coach . - Recalibrating .
 What 's happening ? Coach , it 's getting shorter .
 One- sided observation has destabilized the expiry date . - What ?

 - One- sided observation has destabilized the expiry date .
 Recalibrating .
 ' Cause I looked at it on my own , it made it shorter ?
 - That is correct . - Why ?
 Everything happens for a reason .
 All right , well , undo it , then . Make it go back .
 I cannot do that . Recalibrating .
 What if she looks at it ?
 Once shortened , the expiry date cannot be extended .
 Why ?
 Everything happens for a reason .
 - Come on . Come on . - Recalibrating .
 - When will it stop ?
 - It will stabilize once recalibration has completed .
 Recalibrating .
 Stop it . Stop it . Just ...

 You OK ?
 Yeah , I 'm fine .
 - All right .
 - I 'm good .
 Have you ever had more than four or less than four ?
 What you thinking about ?
 Nothing .
 All right , seriously , what 's up ?
 - I looked .
 - Looked at what ?
 We promised we wouldn 't . We shook on it .
 - Don 't you wanna know what it said ?
 - No . That was the point .
 - It 's almost done anyway . - How almost done ?
 We 've got , like , an hour .
 Why didn 't you tell me this before ?
 - Didn 't wanna spoil today . - And this hasn 't spoilt it ?
 It was supposed to be five years , but now ...
 I looked at it , something happened , it started going down .
 - I don 't know what it was . - So you broke it ?
 No , no , no , no , no . I mean , I don 't ... I don 't know .
 Why did you have to look at it ?
 Look , I was thinking maybe we could overcome it somehow .
 Why did you have to look at it ?
 Because I like you .
 Like properly , really , I like you .
 - For fuck 's sake . And that wasn 't enough ?
 - That 's not the point .
 - I looked , but that 's not the issue here .
 - Are you sure about that ?
 You 're more wound up about that than how short the time is .
 Yes , because we had agreed .
 Listen . Listen . Listen .
 - What if we just ignore it ? - We can 't .
 Listen , we 'll just fuck the system . We 'll fuck it --
 - And do what ? - We 'll jump out , over the wall , get out .
 - There is nothing out there .
 - How d 'you know ? How d 'you know ?
 - Amy ... - You 've ruined this .
 You 've ruined it .
 Hey , it 's nothing .
 - Amy . - Don 't follow me .
 Amy , I 'm sorry .
 Amy .
 - Everything happens for a reason . - What reason ?
 The system will be assessing your reaction to the painful premature termination of a treasured relationship and will adjust and improve its profile of your eventual chosen one accordingly .
 - You 're a great comfort .
 - Thank you .
 I swear to God , I feel like scaling the wall out there and jumping in the fucking wilderness .
 That would contravene the rules of the system .
 Oh , the fucking system .
 Failure to comply with the system may result in banishment .
 All right , I know .
 Christ , will you let me be angry at least ? Will you give me that ?
 You must vacate your current living quarters when the time expires .
 Like I didn 't know .
 And if I hadn 't have looked , we 'd have been together years .
 She was ...
 You know when you meet someone and you just know ?
 You just know that ...
 Reckon you could pop this in me now ? I 've sort of got jaw ache .
 Yeah , come on .
 And after all that , he never even apologized , not once .
 That 's too bad .
 Do you mind if I think about her ?
 If I can think about him ?
 Yeah , sound .
 One , two , three , four .
 One , two , three , four .
 Congratulations , Amy .
 Your ultimate match has been identified .
 Your pairing day is tomorrow .
 - Ultimate as in " the one " ? - That is correct .
 - And we meet tomorrow ? - That is correct .
 Tomorrow you 'll be coupled with your ultimate match and together you will leave this place forever .
 OK .
 Are you allowed to tell me anything about them ?
 - Do I know them already ? - Negative .
 - Right . - There is one more thing .
 Yeah , and what 's that ?
 Prior to pairing day , you have been allocated a short farewell period with an individual of your choosing .
 A farewell period ? Like , I get to say goodbye to someone ?
 That is correct .
 Data shows this can help provide psychological closure .
 Frank , I choose Frank .
 Your choice has been registered .
 Wait . Where are we meeting ?
 Usual booth , 7 : 30 p . m .
 Right .
 - Coach ? - Yes , Amy ?
 Count to four .
 One , two , three , four .
 Wait , wait . How long have we got ?
 Look , the system 's set my pairing day for tomorrow .
 - Yeah , me too . - Right .
 I don 't want whoever the system reckons the one is , OK ?
 - I want you . - I want you .
 Failure to comply with the system
 - may result in banishment . - You can fuck off .
 Can you remember where you were before you came here ?
 You can 't , can you ?
 - No . - Me neither .
 - Why can 't I think of that ? - It 's a test .
 Do you remember the first night that we were together ?
 How did you feel ?
 I felt safe , happy , comfortable .
 It felt right .
 It felt like something locked into place , like we 'd met before .
 Like it had happened before and it 'll happen again ,
 like it 's happened a thousand times over and over again .
 - Do you know what I mean ? - Yeah . Yeah , I do .
 Ever since we 've met , this world has been toying with us .
 It 's trying to keep us apart .
 It 's ...
 It 's a test , I swear it is , and the two of us rebelling together is something to do with passing it .
 We 've gotta fuck it all off .
 Exactly . We 've just gotta fuck the whole thing off and go .
 - Yeah , over the wall . - Right over it .
 - No matter what 's out there .
 - OK .
 So let 's go .
 Yeah , let 's go .
 Come on .
