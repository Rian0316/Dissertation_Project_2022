 He 's a man . Some of them cheat . Not Rob .
 Not after what happened to our daughter .
 I am in love with you . ROB :
 You knew the rules . I will never
 leave my wife .
 Why would he even be with me if he was so happy with her ?
 Maybe she did something to hurt him and he needs time to forgive her .
 I moved my lover into our home .
 The three of us are officially a throuple .
 My agent 's gonna drop me if I don 't get him my script by tomorrow morning .
 Give me the 50 pages . Skip to what sucks .
 That would be your lead character .
 What 's wrong with Eva ? She waits around for 15 pages hoping a man will save her .
 She 's a victim . I hate victims .
 Hey , how did you come up with that stuff anyway ?
 Maybe there 's more to me than meets the eye . The man 's a drug addict .
 Half your savings went up his nose .
 Eli has changed .
 Hold on , I have something .
 Take this .
 What happens when he likes her more than you ?
 He said it 's the best thing I 've ever written .
 God , I am so happy for you .

 Are you having an affair ?
 Karl , I believe you 're jealous .
 Tell me who it is .
 Is it one of our friends from the country club ? SlMONE :

 Wasn 't that lucky , dear .
 Seems Tommy was right there in the bedroom , ready to be useful .
 Don 't you see ?
 We don 't need to get a divorce .
 We have stumbled into the perfect arrangement .
 Everything is not a joke , Karl .
 I want a man who loves me so much , that he would kill another man if I slept with someone else .
 And I 'm never gonna get that from you , am I ? No .

 Simone and I used to be very close , back when I was her hairdresser .
 Taylor and I were forced to socialize ,
 ' cause I was her husband 's agent .
 I didn 't know Beth Ann at all , even though she was a neighbor .
 I used to gossip with her for hours .
 She adored me .
 I tried to talk to her at parties .
 She never got my jokes .
 I used to watch her at the market .
 She seemed nice .
 It 's funny about people .
 They come into our lives every day ... ... and you never know who will play the most important part .
 A total stranger might be the one to save you or destroy you .
 To be honest ... I feel responsible for his death .
 I 'm not sure anyone would 've died if it wasn 't for me .
 I knew she was going to kill him .
 And I am so glad she did .
 Oh , Simone .
 What are you doing here ? What a silly question .
 You know how much I adore our little gallery .
 Oh , please . You haven 't stopped by in months .
 Once we begin negotiating our settlement , I know you 'll fight for this place .
 You 'll tell the judge it should go to you because I never helped out .
 Well , here I am helping out .
 WOMAN :
 Excuse me . Yes ?
 Hello . Do you have any Lichtenstein prints ?
 We 're talking .
 Do you mind ?
 And with charm like that on our sales staff , these paintings should just fly off the walls .
 No Tommy today ?
 We spoke this morning .
 Was that on the phone or did you roll over and tap him on the shoulder ? Oh , yes ?

 I suggested we take a break .
 My divorce lawyer feels an ongoing affair with a teenager could make me seem unsympathetic .
 You 've hired a lawyer ?
 He did my first two divorces , so he knows what I like . Bernie Morton .


 We- we agreed we weren 't gonna get divorced until after Amy 's wedding . No , no , no .


 We agreed not to announce it till then .
 That doesn 't mean we can 't get the ball rolling . B- But there 's so much coming at us in the next few weeks .
 I mean , Amy 's Oklahoma in- laws are turning up tomorrow en masse .
 Oh , God .
 I 'm dreading that dinner .
 I spoke to Brad 's mother for two minutes on the phone .
 I already can 't stand her . Exactly .
 If we 're fighting each other , how will we have the energy to properly hate them ?
 After what you 've put me through , I have more than enough rage to go around .
 All right .
 Clearly , we need counseling .
 I mean , can we at least wait until after we 've seen a therapist ?
 It 's over . No more waiting .
 Accept it .

 Well . I guess I 've helped enough for one day .
 See you at home .

 Hey .
 Hey . Did you see Taylor 's text ?
 Uh , no .
 I 've been writing .
 She got on an early flight . She 's gonna be here in a couple minutes .
 Oh , okay . So , um , I was wondering , when you want to tell her ?
 Tell her ... ?
 About last night ?
 And how- how we fucked ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Oh . You- you want to mention that .
 Well , it happened , so we have to be honest about it , right ?
 Sure .
 Yeah . Great .
 Awesome . Yeah .
 I do wonder , though , um , what- what do you think
 Taylor 's reaction will be when we tell her ?
 I- I think she 'll be cool with it .
 I mean , we 're in a throuple , she 's seen us have sex before .
 I- It 's -- it won 't be a big deal .
 Mm . Interesting .
 That 's interesting .
 What ? You think , you think she might get jealous ?
 Maybe .
 Maybe jealous , maybe furious .
 I mean , likely furious .
 Yeah , but don 't you think she 'll be angrier if we don 't tell her and then she finds out anyway ?
 It -- well , see ?
 See , that 's where the ever- popular
 " take it to our graves " philosophy would come into play .
 You want to keep it a secret ?
 I 'll be honest , it 's not my first inclination , but hearing you say it out loud , I like it . Eli .
 No .
 I ... [ exhales ]
 We can 't .
 That- that feels wrong .
 That 's wrong .
 All right , all right , all right .
 You 're right .
 You 're right . [ car approaching ]
 Anything less than full honesty is a betrayal .
 Okay . [ car door closes ]
 Here she is . Make me proud . Shit .

 Hi .
 Hey , babe .
 How was the flight ?
 Crying babies , bitchy flight attendants , they lost my suitcase and I hate Uber !
 [ door closes ] What have you guys been up to ?
 Uh ... nothing much .
 [ chuckles ] :
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Just happy to have this one home .
 TAYLOR :
 Oh , oh ...
 Mm . [ exhales ] What do you say we put you in a bath , huh ?
 TAYLOR :
 Oh , my God . You deserve it .
 Salt , no salt ?
 So much salt . Salt it up .

 Whatcha doing ?
 I was just trying to think of a place to store all of Nana 's linens .
 If there 's ever a worldwide doily shortage , we 'll be sitting pretty .
 It is done .
 We are now officially unpacked .
 I thought you finished weeks ago .
 You said you hated seeing all of the unpacked boxes lying around , so I put them all in the attic .
 Every day , I would bring one down and empty it .
 You lugged all these boxes to the attic ?
 Just so I wouldn 't have to look at 'em ?
 It was nothing .
 You do so many things each day to please me .
 Things I don 't even notice .
 And I want to notice them , so I can thank you .
 I don 't need to be thanked .
 You know ,
 I 've been working a lot of late nights the past few months .
 This project I 've been involved with , it 's almost over .
 It is ?
 Yeah .
 Once I 'm done , we 'll get back to a normal schedule .
 I 'll be home in time for dinner , every night .
 That would make me very happy .
 So , we 're finally moved in .
 How should we celebrate ?
 Hey .
 Why not throw a party ?
 Like a housewarming thing ? Yes , we can invite all the neighbors .
 There 's so many I haven 't met yet .
 Oh . Let 's do it next Saturday .
 That would be wonderful . Fantastic .
 You want me to throw this box away for you ? Oh , not just yet .
 There 's still some photos in there .
 I was going to put those in the cupboard upstairs .
 [ stammers ]
 Maybe we should leave this one out .
 Really ?
 You said it upset you .
 Eh , that was a while ago .
 [ sets picture down ]
 It hurts to remember , but it 'd be worse to forget .
 You 're absolutely right .
 Simone , we 're going to be late .
 I 'm coming .
 Hold your horses .
 Amy .
 Are you coming with us to the dinner ?
 We assumed you 'd be going with Brad and his family .
 I was with them all day .
 I need a break .
 Oh , are they really that bad ?
 Do you know much about tractors ?
 Um , no .
 You will by dessert . I think you deserve a drink .
 I 'm sure Brad is very pleased that you 're making such an effort .
 Trust me , I 'm sucking up like crazy .
 And if I make a good impression , his parents might buy us a house .
 Ooh . A house ?
 As a wedding gift ?
 Darling , we really need to rethink those fondue forks .
 Their farm sits on millions of gallons of oil .
 So whatever you think of them , be nice .
 I 'm always nice . Really nice .
 Not bitchy nice .
 You 're tying my hands , but fine .
 [ phone ringing ]
 Don 't pick up .
 We 're late . Uh , don 't worry , we 've got one of those newfangled machines that takes a message .
 You know , I don 't know how we lived without it . [ machine beeps ]
 BERNlE [ over phone ] :
 Simone , Bernie Morton here .
 I 'm working on your divorce paperwork , but I still need some financial forms , so ... Bernie , it 's not a good time .
 I 'll talk to you tomorrow .
 You 're getting divorced again ?
 Now , Amy ... Right before my wedding ?
 It won 't affect you .
 Brad 's parents are not going to buy me a house if they think I was raised by a woman who 's never had a marriage
 last longer than a breath mint .
 You 're blaming me ?
 After three husbands , yes .
 What 's your excuse this time ?
 It 's a charming story .
 Y- Yes , well , we- we both have charming stories , but I don 't want to bore you with a lot of what we Brits call , um , tommyrot .
 Fine .
 Let 's just go .

 I 'm Beth Ann Stanton , your new neighbor . Good morning .


 My husband and I just moved in down the street .
 I- I know who you are .
 Well , I hear your name is Mary .
 Mary Vlasin . It 's nice to officially meet you .
 MAN [ calling out ] :
 Mary !
 That your husband ? Uh , yes .
 Now 's not a good time .
 I 'll be quick . I have something for the two of you .
 It 's the reason I dropped by .
 It 's an invitation . Rob and I are throwing a housewarming party on Saturday ; nothing fancy .

 Just finger food and beer .
 We 'll be having some old friends , and hopefully some new ones .
 [ chuckles ] I can 't remember the last time I went to a party .
 MAN :
 Mary ! Uh , do you think you might be able to make it ?
 I 'm just doing a head count .
 I don 't know , um ...
 I was just , uh , talking to our new neighbor .
 I was coming .
 Oh , hello there . I didn 't realize we had company .
 I 'm Beth Ann Stanton .
 I 've just moved in down the street .
 Ah . She invited us to , uh , a party .
 Oh . Just a little housewarming thing on Saturday .
 Mary said she wasn 't sure you 'd be able to ... No , we 'd love to come .
 Really ? Sure .
 You want us to bring anything , or ...
 No .
 No . Just your lovely selves .
 Well , all righty , then .
 We 'll see you soon .
 Wonderful .
 I 'll check with the maître d ' , see if Brad 's family 's arrived .
 Oh , my God . It 's Hector . AMY :
 Hector ?
 He was the best hairdresser I ever had .
 I mean , until he dropped me .
 Why did he drop you ?
 Who knows ?
 One day , he just stopped scheduling appointments .
 Well , I 'm sure you did something to offend him .
 Why would you assume that ?
 Oh , right , I 'm horrible .
 PATTY :
 Amy ! Patty .
 Mom , this is Brad 's sister Patty .
 Oh , it 's lovely to meet you .
 Thank you . Oh , they 've seated us in a private dining room .
 Did you arrange that ?
 I wanted to do something special for my new family . I did .

 Now we can get as loud and crazy as we want . Ah ! It 's a great idea .

 I don 't know if Amy told you , but I know how to yodel .
 No .
 I think I would have remembered that .
 Great , let 's get the party started .
 Karl , everyone 's here . Oh , good .
 Hello .
 Hi .

 Hey , guys .
 Patty . Oh , here they are .
 What a pleasure it is to finally meet you .
 I 'm Ruby and this is Dwight .
 Charmed . DWlGHT :
 Well , hello , there . Hi .
 Sorry we 're late .
 Well , if you were busy making yourself beautiful , may I just say , mission accomplished .
 Heel , Dwight . [ laughter ] I see I 'm gonna have to watch my step around you .
 [ laughs ] I can 't tell you how thrilled we are that Amy 's marrying a young man as admirable as your son .

 That voice .
 He 's like someone on PBS .
 Now , who wants champagne ? I 'm sure we could all be persuaded .
 [ chuckles ]
 I could just listen to him talk all day long .
 If you were married to him , you would .
 Well , Ruby and I are just as crazy about your daughter .
 The whole family is .
 Patty hasn 't shut up about her .
 ' Cause I 'm happy , okay ?
 I 'm finally getting a sister .
 Well , I 'm thrilled to finally be a part of a big family .
 I 've always dreamed of hosting large family gatherings .
 RUBY : You know what I dream about ?
 Grandkids .
 Oh , I 've had that dream .
 I always wake up screaming .
 Now , why don 't you want grandkids ?
 Well , I 'd have to tell people that I 'm a grandmother .
 And let 's face it , who 's gonna believe me ?
 Does anyone need more champagne ?
 Oh , God , yes .
 Yes , absolutely .
 Uh , I 'm terribly sorry .
 Will you excuse me ?
 I , uh , I desperately need to use the facilities .
 Listen to him .
 He even makes taking a piss sound fancy .
 [ Dwight and Ruby laugh ]
 It is done !
 I just wrote the words
 " fade to black . "
 My script is complete !
 Eli !
 Aw ! Oh , my God .
 Oh . [ Eli chuckling ]
 Honey , that 's amazing . Yeah , it is .
 You know what 's amazing ?
 Somehow it all works .
 I mean , the characters , the plot , all of it .
 I mean , I probably used the word " fuck " about 60 times too many , but that 's fixable .
 I mean , the point is :
 I may actually be a good writer .
 [ laughs ] Oh , I 'm so proud of you .
 Oh , thank you .
 Thank you .
 JADE :
 Oh ...
 Mm .
 ELl : Mm .
 Oh , so I called Lamar , and he wants to take us all out to dinner tonight to celebrate .
 Oh , that 'd be great .
 We should go to La Serata .
 Ooh , molto bene .
 Yeah .
 Hmm . Not to change the subject , but I 'm curious about something .
 What 's up ?
 While I was away , did you two fuck ?
 I don 't know why , I just have a feeling .
 Am I crazy ?
 [ laughs ]
 We absolutely fucked .
 Yeah . Shit .
 Wow .
 Hmm .
 Are you upset ?
 Um ... I 'm not sure .
 It 's not like you and I have never done it without Eli .
 [ chuckles ]
 That 's true .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 Okay ?
 I mean , obviously I have some feelings that I need to work through , but this was ... this was bound to happen , right ?
 At some point , since we 're all together now .
 And I love you both , so why ... why would I not want you guys to get closer ?
 Yes , exactly , and I- I knew that if we were just open and honest about the whole thing , that it wouldn 't be a big deal .
 Yeah .
 Well , thank you for telling me the truth .
 It feels good to know . Of course .
 Of course . Mm- hmm .
 Oh , you know what , you should tell Lamar that I know the manager at La Serata , so she can get us a good table .


 Oh , yeah , yeah .
 Totally .
 Great call . [ phone chimes ]
 I will , um ...
 I- I will , I will text Lamar right now .
 Okay .
 [ phone chimes ]

 So I can tell Rob is still mad about the other night .
 He hasn 't called in days .
 I thought about calling him , but I don 't want to seem desperate , although I am a little bit , but he doesn 't need to know that .

 Anyway ... [ chuckles ]
 what do you think I should do ? Hmm .
 What ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Listen to me . I must be boring you to tears always talking about Rob .
 No , I 'm sorry .
 I was thinking about this woman I met today .
 I can 't get her out of my mind .
 Why ?
 I was at her door dropping something off , and , just , something wasn 't quite right .
 How do you mean ?
 She was worried about her husband .
 I could hear him calling for her . There was just something about his tone .
 It scared me .
 Then he came to the door , and he was charming .
 This woman , was she wearing a lot of makeup ?
 She was . How did you know that ?
 He hits her .
 You think ?
 No , he isn 't the type .
 He 's very successful .
 My father was a doctor .
 I used to watch my mother apply makeup to cover up her black eyes .
 Oh , no .
 She would smear green concealer to cover the bruise , and then she would apply a second layer of concealer that matched her skin tone .
 And then she would do the same thing to the other side so that people wouldn 't notice the difference .
 That 's awful .
 No , here 's the awful part .
 My whole family knew what was going on .
 Aunts , uncles , cousins -- they all knew what he was doing , and they just looked the other way .
 I hate people that look the other way .
 And he told the owner he was willing to match any offer the Gibson twins could come up with .
 [ laughs ] And that 's how
 Dwight cornered the Tulsa County market for earth- moving machinery .
 [ laughter ]
 The next thing that happened ... Please stop !
 Until I find Karl .
 [ laughs ] He would hate to miss this amazing story .
 DWlGHT : He has been in the gents ' room quite a while .
 Uh , you want me to check on him ?
 [ laughs ] :
 No . I- I 've got this .
 Ma 'am , that 's the men 's room . Oh , I know .
 My husband isn 't hiding out in the ladies ' room .
 [ gasps ]
 So nice to finally meet you , Lamar .
 I 've heard so much about you .
 Heard a lot about you , too , pretty lady .
 And I have so many questions .
 Please don 't ask them . [ laughs ] Come on .
 I 'm paying for this meal .
 All I want in exchange is a few juicy details about your new lifestyle .
 All right , dude , don 't embarrass me .
 I wouldn 't ask if I didn 't need to know .
 Why do you need to know ?
 Truth is , I 've been thinking about bringing another woman into my relationship with Delores .
 And she 's open to the idea ?
 Absolutely not . [ laughter ]
 All right , okay , all right .
 Let 's talk about my script . Mm- hmm .
 Eli said that you think it 's good . No .
 I think it 's brilliant .
 Okay , just tell me it 'll sell . Oh , yes .
 I already got four different producers interested .
 I 'm expecting offers in the high six- figure range .
 [ exhales ]
 Are you serious ?
 I joke about sex , not money .
 Wow .
 I- I 've never had a script get that kind of reaction before .
 You 've never written a script this commercial before .
 And I guess we have you to thank for that . [ laughs ] :
 Stop .
 What ?
 It just --
 Eli was having some problems with his story , so I read the first 50 pages , and I- I gave him a few ideas .
 More than a few .
 I mean , she saved my ass is what she did .
 That part at the end , where- where Eva , she burns the place down and goes ,
 like , full- blown arsonist on everybody ?
 Mm- hmm . Jade 's idea .
 Cool . ELl :
 Mm .
 So , you let her read the script before it was finished ?
 W- Well , yeah .
 ' Cause you never let me do that .
 [ chuckles softly ]
 No -- h- honey , my back was up against the wall on this .
 I mean ...
 Huh . I- I also ,
 I- I gave him some thoughts on the lead character .
 You know , I have insight into the millennial female brain . And it shows .
 Eva is the- the best character he 's ever created .
 Ah , I- I don 't know about that . I do .
 Trust me , Eli .
 Be good to Jade .
 She 's your muse .
 ELl :
 You might be right . Oh , that 's ridiculous .
 LAMAR :
 So , Jade , you ever think about doing any writing yourself ?
 Um , yeah . I- I have ,
 I actually have a couple script ideas , yeah .
 LAMAR :
 Well , I would love to hear about them . Really ?
 Yeah .
 Um , excuse me for just one moment . Yeah .
 Are you sure ?
 He 's always looking for my replacement , so please . [ Lamar laughs ]
 What in God 's name ?
 Shit .
 We ...
 We got a bit carried away .
 We haven 't seen each other in years . Oh , my God .
 Is that why you dropped me as a client ?
 Because you were screwing my husband !
 I couldn 't look you in the eye anymore .
 It was impossible to trim your bangs .
 I think you should leave now .
 For what it 's worth ,
 I love the layers . Go .

 How could you ?
 You can 't be completely shocked .
 You knew perfectly well I slept with men .
 But with Hector ?
 You 're surprised that the man I slept with was your hairdresser ?
 That is the gay sex equivalent of " the butler did it . "
 What the hell is going on ?
 Nothing . We 're fine .
 We are not fine .
 You would not believe how Karl betrayed me .
 I don 't care .
 I 've spent six months sucking up to the Clampetts , and you 're not gonna blow it for me in one night .
 Now move it !
 Come on .
 Let 's not ruin her chances with unnecessary drama .
 Fine .
 I 'll wait till we 're in divorce court .
 And what I do to you then will be very necessary .

 Amy helps me buy something chic and I ruin it first time out .
 We 'll just go shopping again tomorrow .
 For grease on silk , you want talcum powder .
 There 's a travel size in the rental car .
 Okay .
 Excuse me .
 Brad tells us you two run an art gallery together .
 What 's that like ?
 Fun . Challenging .
 It 's a challenge , but a fun one .
 Unlike our marriage , which is purely a challenge .
 RUBY : Speaking of marriage ,
 I 'm just curious , Simone , how many times have you been married ?
 Just three .
 Why ?
 It 's just an innocent question , my love .
 I wasn 't talking to you . I know .
 Why are you so cross with him ?
 I wasn 't cross .
 Was I cross ?
 You were definitely cross .
 RUBY :
 Um , not that it 's any of my business , but ... if I were twice divorced , then hooked a man
 like Karl , I 'd treat him a little nicer .
 Now I 'm curious about something , Ruby .
 How would you treat Karl if you walked into the bathroom and found him kissing another man ?
 Mm .
 Bravo , Simone .
 That 's right , sugar .
 Karl is gay .
 Still have a crush on him ?
 Your stepdad is gay ?
 I thought he was just English .
 That 's why we 're getting divorced .
 Dear God . Another divorce ?
 Not really the headline , Dwight .
 Oh , you poor , tragic woman .
 I have suffered .
 It 's true .
 I- I 'm sorry , do not shed tears for Simone .
 She is receiving ample comfort in the arms of her lover
 Tommy Harte .
 What the fuck ?
 Shut up , Karl .
 You 're sleeping with Tommy ? Who , for the newcomers , is all of 18 years of age .
 Oh , sweet suffering Jesus .
 British homos , teen lovers ?
 DWlGHT :
 What kind of spangled hell pit are you marrying into ?
 PATTY :
 Hey . Found the talcum powder .
 [ chuckles softly ]
 Why is everyone so serious ?
 I never thought I 'd see the day our family would have a homosexual in it .
 Brad , you swore you wouldn 't tell .
 No , Patty , Patty , I- I ...
 Oh , I- I don 't know what Brad told you , but my feelings for you are sisterly , not sexual .
 Oh , sweet suffering Jesus .
 [ crying ]
 [ stammers ] Patty !
 Oh , come back !
 DWlGHT : Sweet baby , please say it 's not true .
 Oh .
 She 's a lesbian . Mmm .
 How did I miss that ?
 Anybody want an after- dinner cocktail ?
 Uh , not me .
 I have the worst headache .
 Why don 't you go on upstairs and lie down ?
 We can give you a little space tonight .
 That 'd be nice . Thank you .

 I 'm gonna have me a scotch . You want one ?

 [ drink pouring ]
 Jade ?
 How could you not tell me ?
 [ chuckles ] :
 I 'm not sure I know what you 're talking ...
 The pills , Eli .
 You 're an addict and you let me give you pills .
 [ sighs ]
 Shit .
 How did you ... Taylor told me .
 At dinner , in the bathroom .
 Shit .
 She d -- she doesn 't know that I took anything , though , right ?
 No .
 Oh , thank Christ . Not yet .
 No .
 No .
 No , no , no , no , no .
 What do you mean , " No " ?
 I have to .
 This is too big .
 Fuck .
 [ exhales ] : What am I gonna do ?
 I mean , she 's already questioning our living arrangement .
 If she finds out about this , it doesn 't matter how she feels about me .
 I am out on the street .
 I don 't have anywhere to go , Eli .
 And Willow and Mischa are gone and Duke is still out there . Listen .
 And I ... Jade , Jade , listen- listen to me .
 That 's not gonna happen . Okay ?
 I 'm not gonna let that happen .
 I need you here . Why ?
 Because I 'm your muse or am I , am I just your dealer ?
 [ stammers ]
 I 'm- I 'm done with the pills . Okay ?
 Done .
 So she doesn 't need to know .
 In that case , give them to me .
 What ? If you 're done with them , then there 's no reason that you can 't give them back .
 So ?
 Look , the thing is , one of the producers who 's interested wants a rewrite . I knew it .
 [ stammers ]
 She 's got some really great ideas .
 Lamar says if I can turn out a draft by Friday ... Eli . [ whispers ] :
 J -- All right , fine .
 Jesus , just take them ....
 [ sighs ]
 Just , I 'm- I 'm- I 'm so , I 'm so , so close to getting my career back .
 You can handle a few rewrites without them .
 [ chuckles ]
 Yeah , all I know is that I used to be a writer and an addict , and then I got clean , and all of a sudden , I wasn 't a writer anymore .
 But if I can do this , if I can , if I can finish this thing and if I can get it to them on time , then , you know , I 'm ... [ claps hands ] [ grunts ]
 I 'm back .
 I will be legit again , they will trust me again and the money that will follow , Jade ... ... I can take care of you .

 Please .
 I need them .
 And you promise you 'll take care of me ?
 I promise .
 [ exhales ]
 Let 's get to work on your movie .
 Christ , what an evening .
 I 'm exhausted .
 Oh , you 're not staying here tonight .
 Is that so ?
 I want you to pack your things and leave , now .
 Oh , knock it off , Simone .
 I 'm angry enough as it is . You 're angry ?
 My daughter may never speak to me again .
 Oh , and whose fault is that ?
 If you 'd just kept your mouth shut instead of humiliating me .
 I was provoked .
 Oh , so there was no possible way you could suppress the impulse to blow up the entire evening ?
 Says the man who couldn 't stop himself from sneaking off to the men 's room for a quickie .
 Oh , fuck you !
 I 've spent my whole damn life controlling myself , hiding the central fact of my existence so I wouldn 't disappoint my family , my friends or my wife .
 Hector was the only person who ever saw me for the man I truly am , not the one I was pretending to be .
 You have no idea what he meant to me .
 Stop romanticizing your grubby little fling .
 I loved him !
 He asked me to run away with him .
 Um , but I- I had made a commitment to you , so I chose to stay .
 I am your wife .
 Am I supposed to be grateful that you didn 't walk out ?
 I just want you to see it from my perspective for once .
 Just think about what it may have cost me to honor the vow I made to you .
 So no , Simone , I do not expect you to be grateful for the sacrifice I made , but for fuck 's sake , at least acknowledge it .
 I am going to bed .
 Not in the guest room .
 In our room , in our bed .
 You sleep where you like .
 The Thompsons just left .
 Said to thank you for a lovely time .
 So , you 're not talking to me .
 What am I supposed to say ?
 It was a party .
 I wasn 't gonna cause a scene .
 He hurt her , right in front of you , and you did nothing .
 What was I supposed to do ?
 Hit him ? I mean , I 'm sure our guests would have loved that .
 You could have at least confronted him .
 Reminded him that kind of behavior is unacceptable .
 The guy had been drinking .
 I- I 'm sure he didn 't mean to hurt her .
 This is not the first time he 's gotten rough with her .
 How do you know that ?
 She had several bruises on her arm .
 That 's why she 's wearing long sleeves on such a hot day .
 If it 's that bad , why doesn 't she leave him ?
 And where would she go , Rob ?
 Here ?
 Will you let her sleep on our sofa ?
 Jesus , Beth Ann , I don 't know .
 And what if Ralph comes banging on our door in the middle of the night to try to drag her back ?
 Would you have the balls to stand up to him then ?
 Don 't use that kind of language .
 Of course you wouldn 't .
 You would just slink away like the coward you are !
 Okay !
 He 's not the perfect husband .
 It 's not my job to judge him !
 Would you like the neighbors coming in here and judging you for not being the perfect mother ?
 Huh ? !
 I 'm just saying , leave it alone .
 [ exhales ]
 I didn 't know you were still here .
 I was just upstairs .
 Just ... picking up some trash .
 So you heard everything ?
 Yeah .
 What was that all about ?
 Honey .
 It 's okay .
 You can talk to me .
 Whatever it is , I don 't judge .
 Our daughter died because of me .
 I 'm the one who 's responsible .
 [ doorbell rings ]
 Simone .
 What are you doing here ?
 I need to know .
 Do you love him ?
 I do .
 Okay , then invite me in .
 We have a lot to talk about .
