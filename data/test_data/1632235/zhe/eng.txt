 Whatcha doin ' there ? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner ?
 The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote ?
 Yes .
 And this is a schematic for a bird- trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury ?
 Yes .

 What I 'm doing here is trying to determine when I 'm going to die .
 A lot of people are working on that research .
 So what is all this ?
 My family history factoring in longevity , propensity for disease , et cetera .
 Interesting . Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB .
 What 's " KBB " ?
 " Killed by badger . "
 How 's that ?
 It was Thanksgiving .
 Uncle Carl said , " I think
 " there 's a badger living in our chimney . Hand me that flashlight . "
 Those were the last words he ever spoke to us .
 I don 't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary .
 Not true .
 The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically .
 Instead of fleeing , he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family .
 Who 's to say that I don 't share that flawed DNA ?
 You can always get a badger and find out .

 But seriously , even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor , at best I have 60 years left .
 That long , huh ?
 60 only takes me to here .
 I need to get to here .
 What 's there ?
 The earliest estimate of the singularity , when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality .
 So , you 're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self- aware robot ?
 By this much .
 Tough break .
 You want eggs ?
 You don 't get it , Leonard .
 I 'm going to miss so much -- the unified field theory , cold fusion , the dogapus .
 What 's a dogapus ?
 The hybrid dog and octopus .
 Man 's underwater best friend .
 Is somebody working on that ?
 I was going to .
 I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday .
 Wait a minute . You hate dogs .
 A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls .
 No one can hate that .

 What do we owe you ?
 It came to $28 . 17 .
 Let 's say six bucks apiece . Here you go .
 Thank you .

 What ?
 Never mind .
 I got it . Oh , you wanted me to pay . It 's no big deal .
 No , no , no , no .
 You 're right .
 We 're not going out anymore ; I should pay for myself .


 What ?
 He said , " If he had woman parts , he 'd eat for free the rest of his life "
 Yeah , but you wouldn 't be able to talk to yourself .
 I 'm a little low on cash .
 How much you got ?
 Nothing . How can you walk around with no money ?
 I 'm cute . I get by .
 It 's okay , you can owe me .
 Thank you . Sheldon , six bucks .
 No , thank you .
 I 'm not eating pizza tonight .
 But it 's Thursday .
 Thursday 's pizza night . Not for me .
 Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night .
 Tonight 's selection :
 Brussels sprouts .
 Really ?
 You 're changing the Sheldonian calendar ?
 It 's a small price to pay .
 For what ? No , no , don 't ask .
 Sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry .
 In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics , I need to change my diet .
 Wait .
 Cybernetics is robot stuff , right ? Correct .
 So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot ?
 Essentially , yes .
 Okay , here 's my question .
 Didn 't you already do that ? No .

 Flattering , but sadly , no .
 I 'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system .
 AKA jogging . Wait . Honey , have you ever run before ?
 Certainly .
 I 've run from bullies , dogs , angry chickens ... and one particularly persistent P. E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test .


 You 're right .
 Penny jogs .
 Maybe you guys can run together .
 That 's an excellent idea .

 Yeah , if we chat , it will create the illusion of time going faster .
 No , it won 't . Um , how does he know I jog ?
 Oh , he watches you from his car with high- powered binoculars .
 Oh , my God , that is so creepy ! I know !

 And he says he 's not gonna stop .
 Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women .

 What the hell ?
 What 's the matter ?
 I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen .
 I 'm nauseated and feverish .
 I believe I may have cholera .
 There 's no cholera in Pasadena .
 Just like last summer , when there was no malaria in Pasadena .
 Well , if it 's not cholera , then based on a quick Internet search , the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung 's Disease , botulism , a 30- foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms .


 When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms ?
 It 's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24- hour flower mart with a less- than - vigilant proprietor .
 Oh , Lord , my belly !
 Ever had your appendix out ?
 I haven 't .
 I 've been meaning to , but who has the time ?
 Let 's get you to the hospital .
 So this is how it ends ... with cruel irony .
 Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body ,
 I am betrayed by my appendix , a vestigial organ .
 Do you know the original purpose of the appendix , Leonard ?
 No . I do . And yet I 'm doomed while you live on .


 Funny how things work out , isn 't it ?
 Oh , Lord , I think it 's about to burst !
 On the other hand , it might have been the Brussels sprouts .
 Good night .
 Good night .
 Appendicitis .
 What a nervous Nelly .

 Penny !
 Penny !
 Penny !
 Coming , coming .
 Hey , nice knees .
 Thank you . They 're my mother 's .
 Oh . And the Flash shirt is what ?
 Because , what , you 're gonna run really fast ?
 No , the Flash shirt is because it 's Friday , but it 's nice when things work out .
 Where 's your heart rate monitor ? I don 't have one . What about your pedometer ?
 Don 't have one .
 Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod ?
 Uh , no .
 What do you do , you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny ?
 No .
 I just run till I 'm hungry , then I stop for a bear claw .
 Why are you doing that ?
 It 's good to stretch your muscles before you run . All right . All right ,
 let 's start with a toe touch .


 Okay , you do it .
 I doing it . Oh . Wow .
 Good job .
 Okay , um , can you do this ?

 We 'll never know .
 Okay , let 's just warm up on the run . Okay . Okay , let 's go .
 I 've been reading up on biomechanics .
 I think you 'll be surprised at my ...

 Oh , my God , are you okay ?
 I think so .
 Oh , let me help you up . Thank you .

 Oh , Sheldon !
 If it makes you feel any better , Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night .

 Here 's my chicken curry .
 Howard , your shrimp biryani . Thank you , sir . Palak paneer , that 's Penny .
 Thanks .
 And for Rajesh Koothrappali , from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate , one large order of chicken McNuggets .


 Hey , what 's my share ?
 Uh ... 12 bucks .
 Okay , can I get you after Friday when I get paid ? Sure .
 What am I up to now ?
 Well , okay , with the Indian food , the pizza , the Thai food , the tank of gas , the frozen yogurt and your rent , uh ... a little over $1, 400 .




 What now ?
 He 's just expressing his admiration that you don 't even have to put out to get free stuff .
 It 's not free -- I 'm gonna pay him back .
 Shut up !
 Sheldon , are you gonna join us ? Coming !


 Greetings , friends .
 Greetings , whatever the hell you are .
 I am a mobile virtual presence device .
 Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world .
 Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness ,
 I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner .
 That 's your question -- when did he put a ramp in ?
 Really ?


 You 're in my spot .

 This may seem a little odd at first , but over time , you 'll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration .
 Yeah , to be honest , I don 't see much difference .
 Thank you . That 's what I was going for .
 Now , Leonard , tomorrow , when we go to work , you 'll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs .
 For your convenience , I disassemble into four pieces .
 This is ridiculous .
 I 'm coming to talk to you . You don 't know where I am .
 My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure , undisclosed location .
 You 're in your bedroom . No , I 'm not .
 I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom .

 No , you can 't .
 Wait .
 Come back . Halt .
 Authorized personnel only !
 So , either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear ?
 Only 1, 400 bucks .

 Sheldon , this is ridiculous .
 I 'm behind you .
 Please look at me when you 're talking to me . I am looking at you .
 No , you 're not .
 Pay no attention to that man in the bed .
 You cannot exist as a virtual presence .
 Not here and certainly not at work . Oh , good God .
 At my age , do you know how I 'm statistically most likely to die ?
 At the hands of your roommate ?
 An accident . That 's how I 'm going to make it look .
 Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container , my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed .
 Fine , but don 't expect my help .
 You have to help -- it 's in the roommate agreement .
 No , it 's not .
 Section 74 . C.
 The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot .
 I 'll be damned .


 This is delightful .
 Uh- huh .
 It 's much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death .
 Refresh my memory . Why didn 't I just put you in the trunk ?
 Because I called shotgun .
 Remember ?
 Right .


 You seem tense .
 Perhaps this will relax you .


 I don 't want to listen to music , Sheldon .
 Very well .
 I don 't understand why you 're not enjoying this .
 Together , in this car , with my enhanced capabilities , we 're like
 Except in the car isn 't a yammering sphincter .
 You mock the sphincter , but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn 't survive .
 There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body .
 How many can you name ?
 I was wrong -- this is exactly like
 Perhaps you 'd be interested in a different game .
 No . This is a photograph of the 1911
 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta .
 Using Photoshop , I 've introduced a few anachronisms .
 See if you can spot all 24 . I 'll give you the first one .
 Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch .
 And go .
 That 's it . Bye- bye .
 Bazinga .
 Whoa !

 I have an override switch .
 I almost died !
 And I 'm safe and sound in bed . Who 's crazy now ?
 I 'm still going to go with you .

 Hello , Professor Hoskins .
 Nice to see you , Mindy .
 And
 Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory .



 Leonard , my door .
 What about it ?
 Be a lamb and open it for me . Why ? What 's the problem ?



 You think you have me stymied , don 't you ?
 No , I think a doorknob has you stymied . Oh , look , it 's Leonard and R2- D- Bag .

 That 's my joke .
 I told it last night . You can 't just use it .
 Raj , be a lamb and open the door for me .
 Oh , sure .
 He 's a lamb .
 You 're not .
 I 'm a lamb .

 Isn 't this nice ?
 The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin .
 I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas .
 That 's two , dude .
 Write your own jokes .
 Oh , great .

 Hi , I 'm Penny , I 'll be your waitress .
 Why are you introducing yourself ?
 I 'd rather people not know
 I have any prior connection to you whatsoever .
 Can you tell me the specials this evening ?
 Sheldon , I 'm not waiting on you . Obviously .
 I don 't even have water yet . Because you 're not here .
 That 's discrimination against the otherwise located .
 I 'm going to have to go over your head .
 Manager ... manager .
 Oh , Lord , look who it is . Is that Steve Wozniak ?
 I think it is . The Great and Powerful Woz .
 Penny , Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer .
 He and Steve Jobs started it ... Yeah , I know who he is .
 I watch
 I must speak to him .
 Of course you must .

 You know , there 's an Olive Garden down the street .
 You guys should try it sometime .
 Excuse me , Mr. Wozniak ?
 Oh , hey . Nice virtual presence device .
 Thank you .
 I just want to say I 'm a big fan .
 You 're my 15th favorite technological visionary .
 Only 15th ?
 It 's still six spots above Steve Jobs .
 I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship .
 Yeah , I never got that turtleneck thing . One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two .
 Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3 . 3 , it was a pretty nifty little achievement .
 Thanks , we were shooting for " nifty . " You know , if you had it here ,
 I 'd autograph it for you .
 Don 't move for 15 to 30 minutes , depending on how the buses are running .
 Nerds .

 I 'm coming , Woz , I 'm coming . Ow !
 Oh !
 Aw .
 Penny ...
 Penny ...
 Penny .
 What up , Shel- Bot ?
 I can 't get out of bed . I hurt my ankle .
 What do you want me to do ?
 Sing me " Soft Kitty . "
 Really , you want me to sing " Soft Kitty " to a computer monitor ?
 Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person ? ♪ Soft kitty , warm kitty ♪ ♪ Little ball of fur ... ♪
 Closer to the microphone . ♪ Happy kitty , sleepy ... ♪
 No .
 You have to start over . ♪ Soft kitty , warm kitty ♪ ♪ Little ball of fur ♪ ♪ Happy kitty , sleepy kitty ♪ ♪ Purr , purr , purr . ♪
