 00 : 00 : 03, 003 -- > 00 : 00 : 07, 094 Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married ?
 He can 't believe it .
 And neither can I.
 Hi , Dad .
 How you doing ?
 Then by the power vested in me ... by EvenYouCanPerformWeddings . com ...
 I now pronounce you husband and wife .
 You may kiss the bride .

 Good morning , wife .
 Good morning , husband .
 I can 't believe we 're actually married .
 It 's official .
 According to tradition , we should hang the bedsheets outside so the villagers can see that we consummated .
 I don 't think that that 's appropriate , considering where we 're starting our honeymoon .
 Well , I suppose you 're right .
 Although , when you think about it ,
 Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress .
 Two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap .
 That 'sthe sound you were making .
 I almost forgot . While you were sleeping , I ordered room service .

 Really ?
 Voil√† !
 You thought it was going to be food , didn 't you ?











 Is it nice having Sheldon and Amy away on their honeymoon ?
 Yeah , because now Leonard and I get all this alone time .
 But you 're not alone .
 We 're here . Yes . Yes , you are .
 Would you like us to leave so you and Leonard can talk about all the things you have in common ?
 Ha , ha , she called your bluff .
 So , something pretty cool happened .
 Channel 3 asked me to be on the news tomorrow night to talk about the meteor shower .
 That 's great . Hey !
 Congratulations .
 You know , that 's how Neil deGrasse Tyson got his start .
 He went from the Hayden Planetarium to guesting on the local news to ruining everyone 's favorite movies on the Internet .


 Now it 's happening to me .
 Ooh , I should probably make a list of all the scientific inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2 .
 You 're gonna go on live TV and admit you 've seen that movie ? Hey , your husband 's the one who took me .

 Meryl Streep andCher ?
 Yeah , I saw it .
 Sounds like someone 's in there .
 My God , what if Sheldon and Amy are getting robbed ?
 Or worse , what if they 're back early ?
 They 're not ; They just posted a picture in front of the Statue of Liberty .
 Real or Lego ?
 Lego .
 So , what should we do ? Should someone go check it out ?
 I would , but I got to be on TV tomorrow .
 Got to protect the money .


 Yeah , someone 's definitely in there .
 Okay , let 's go into our apartment .
 We 'll lock the door , we 'll call the pol ...
 Hello ? ! Anyone in there ? !


 Yes ? Mr. Fowler .
 Sorry , we didn 't know you were here .
 We- we actually thought someone was breaking in . And we were ready to take them down .

 Amy asked me to water her plants . She doesn 't have any plants .

 Well , you caught me in a lie .
 Have a good day .


 That was weird , right ?
 Was it ?
 I- I honestly can 't tell anymore .
 Hey , did you even see Mamma Mia 1 ?
 Didn 't need to .
 The sequel stands on its own .

 Here you go .
 If you need any recommendations while visiting New York , please don 't hesitate to contact me .
 Well , it is our honeymoon .
 So we are going to be quite busy .
 Got it .
 Harry Potterplay , parts one and two .
 And tomorrow , a tour of the sites where Nikola Tesla lived , worked and slowly went crazy .
 And , of course , coitus .

 Well , enjoy New York .
 And , I guess , coitus .

 Really , Sheldon ?
 You want to do it again ?
 Don 't act surprised .
 It 's clearly marked on the schedule .
 Now , shall we steam the wrinkles out of our wizard robes , or make vigorous , socially sanctioned love ?
 Either way , I can check something off my to- do list .
 Socially sanc ...
 Wow .
 Yeah , there it is right there .


 Hurry .
 Raj is on next .
 I can 't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries but they 'll show this .
 All right .
 This is the news .
 And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires .
 What is your point ?
 Larry ?
 I know you 're in there !
 Is that Amy 's mom ?
 Let me in .
 Let me in !
 Either that or the Big Bad Wolf .


 Larry ?
 Mrs. Fowler , are you okay ?
 I 'm okay .
 It 's my husband you should worry about .
 We do .
 Larry , come on .
 I don 't think he 's in there .

 I mean , he came by to water the imaginary plants , but then he left .
 You are so naive .
 Blondie here is gonna chew you up and spit you out .
 Well , don 't tell him .
 Come on , you have an extra key .
 Open it up .
 All right , but I 'm telling you he 's not in there .

 There . See ?
 He 's in here .
 I can smell his Axe body spray .
 He wears Axe body spray .
 You happy ?
 You smell like Amy 's dad .

 Larry ? Ooh , come on .
 Shouldn 't we mind our own business ?
 Wow , sometimes it 's like you don 't know me at all .

 See , he 's not here .
 You don 't know him like I do .
 To be fair , we don 't know either of you .
 Satisfied ?

 Yeah , now I smell him .
 Man , that is one hot weather girl .
 How come if I say that I get in trouble ?
 You want to say it ?
 You can say it .


 Nice try .
 You 're gonna have to find some other way to not have sex with me tonight .
 And it 's not weather girl , it 's weather woman .
 And with us today to talk about the upcoming meteor shower and the best places to view it ,
 Caltech astrophysicist Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali .
 Thank you for being here .
 Thank you for having me .
 I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson was unavailable .
 Yeah .

 What do you mean , " yeah " ?
 Not important . So , what can we expect to see from this meteor shower ?

 Well , I think you can count on a lot of flaming gas , which is what you would have gotten from your first choice , Neil deGrasse Tyson .
 Pull up , Raj , pull up !
 Sounds like there 's no love lost between you and Dr. Tyson .
 No , I love Neil .
 I mean , not as much as Neil loves Neil , but who does , right ?
 I want to look away , but I can 't .
 You know , I 'm told we are out of time , having learned nothing about meteor showers and too much about Dr. Koothrappali .

 Thank you .

 Do you know what I love about Broadway theater ?
 It 's so interactive .

 You 're so close to the actors .
 It 's like you 're in the play .
 I mean , you yell , " Harry , watch out , " he looks right at you .
 And not just Harry , everyone onstage .
 At the risk of sounding redundant ,
 All right , well , it 's a bit late , but I did block out the rest of the evening for conjugal relations .
 Should we shower ?
 I mean before , not during .
 That 's how you fall and break a hip .
 You know , I 'm a little jet- laggy .
 Maybe we can revisit this in the morning .
 No can do .
 If we miss tonight , it 's not scheduled until Thursday at 600 .
 And that 'll have to be " no frills , " ' cause we 've got a 630 reservation at Benihana .
 Sheldon , do we really have to do this on a schedule ?
 Are you suggesting spontaneity ?
 I- I guess , yeah .
 So , now that we 're married , sex can occur at any time ?
 Like , we can be brushing our teeth , and suddenly your minty- fresh tongue is in my mouth ?
 No , thank you .
 Really ?
 Would it be so bad to mix it up a little ? Mix it up ?
 Who are you , Betty Crocker ?
 Where are you going ?
 To take a shower . Now that sex can happen at any time ,
 I always have to be ready .
 Should probably live under a waterfall . Well , you don 't have to worry about sex happening tonight .
 Well , thanks , but I 'm still gonna rinse off .
 I touched a lot of stuff in the gift shop .


 No message , no note .
 Who would do that ? What kind of husband would ...
 If you let him talk , maybe you 'll find out .
 Fine .
 Larry ?


 Well , there you go . What more can he say ?
 Let 's go home . I think I 'll stay .
 Well , if you 're going to stay , then I 'll stay .
 All right , well , you know who doesn 't need to stay ?
 Us .
 Come on .

 Penny , come on .
 Aw .

 I don 't think those two are gonna make it .





 Poor Mr. Fowler , I really feel sorry for the little guy . I know .
 After they had Amy , she should 've just eaten him and been done with it .
 Look at you retaining facts from a nature show .
 I know , really , what did he ever see in her ?
 He 's so , so sweet , and she 's such a ballbuster .
 Some guys think strong women are sexy .
 Yeah , but they seem to have nothing in common .
 Yeah , well , sometimes opposites attract .
 Wait , are- are you saying we are like them ?
 I don 't know , maybe a little .
 So you 're the sweet , quiet one and I 'm Amy 's mom ?
 Is that what you 're saying ?



 Hey , check out what Neil deGrasse Tyson just tweeted .
 " I 've been informed that some random , " attention- seeking nobody
 " took a cheap shot at me on the local news . "
 That 's me .
 Guys , he 's talking about me ! You know , I cut you a lot of slack
 ' cause you come from another country , but you 've been here a long time .

 Raj , you need to apologize to Dr. Tyson . Why ?

 This could be good for me .
 Everybody loves a good Twitter feud .
 Neil and I could be like the new , Katy Perry and Taylor Swift .
 Come on , Raj , you 're better than this .
 Leave room for dessert
 ' cause I 'm gonna make you eat those words .
 " Dear Dr. Tyson ,
 " much like epithelial tissue , it appears I 've gotten under your skin . " iPhone drop , but I won 't ' cause I don 't have AppleCare .
 What 'd he say ?
 " Nice try , genius .
 The skin isepithelial tissue . "
 It 's on .
 He 's Katy , I 'm T- Swift .
 What are you gonna do ?
 He 's from another country .

 And here we have the former hotel where Tesla perfected the three- phase alternating current motor .
 That 's wrong .
 I 'm gonna say something . Don 't .
 Well , then how will everyone know I 'm the smartest boy here ?
 Just let it go .
 Is everything all right ?
 You seem testy this morning . I 'm not testy .
 I 'll have to take your word for it .
 There 's no test for testy .
 Is it possible that you 're sexually frustrated ?
 Okay , now I 'm testy .
 If you had adhered to my coital schedule , your brain would be floating on a sea of oxytocin right now .
 Don 't talk to me about my brain .
 I 'm a neurobiologist .
 Then you should know the benefits of the special hug that grown- ups give each other .
 Sheldon , everybody 's listening .
 Of course they 're listening ; We 're interesting .
 Unlike that guy .
 I- I 'm walking away from you .



 I 'm only recently married .
 Do I stay here ?
 Do I follow ?
 Say something useful .


 Morning , sunshine .
 So I see you 're making espresso .
 Yup .
 Just need that extra jolt for a successful day of ballbusting .
 Really ? I don 't , I don 't think you do .
 You know , you compared us to the strangest couple we know , and we know Amy and Sheldon ,
 Howard and Bernadette , Raj and his twitchy little dog .
 I- I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have said that .
 Because it wasn 't nice or because it wasn 't true ?
 It 's not true .
 Mrs. Fowler is an angry , vindictive woman , whereas you are warm and- and loving , quick to forgive .
 Please .
 I- I 'm serious .
 And I 'm nothing like Amy 's dad .
 He 's a mousy little man who can 't stand up for himself .
 My point is you 're not like her , so we 're not like them .
 Well , 30 years from now , are you gonna hide from me because I 'm so scary ?
 Hey , I- I don 't think you 're scary .
 Yes , I flinch when you make sudden moves , but ... that says more about my childhood than you .
 Aw .



 Your turn .
 Hang on , I 'm checking to see if Neil replied to my latest smackdown .
 Really ?
 Don 't you think this Twitter feud is a little silly ? Absolutely not .

 It 's- it 's two respected scientists debating opposing views in a public forum .
 You called him Mike Tyson 's little sister .
 Yeah , and now Mike Tyson 's mad at me , too .
 Raj , you 're not going to impress anyone by attacking him .
 Bernadette , you sound so old right now .


 He said he needs a break , and I 'm too much for him .
 I 'm sure he didn 't mean that .
 He said I 'm overbearing !
 Please , you 're just the right amount of bearing .
 Look , I know he loves you .
 If you just give him some space , I 'm sure he 'll come back .
 You really think so ? Yeah , I do .
 You 're a good person , Penny .
 I hope we get to spend lots of time together .

 Me , too .

 Yes ?
 Hit the road .
 But ...
 Now !
 Can I get my stuff ?
 Be quick about it !



 Hello . Hello .
 I brought you two hot dogs .
 A- Aren 't you gonna eat one ?
 From a street cart ? Are you crazy ? I 'm amazed that I 'm holding them .
 I 'm not really hungry .
 You realize that I 'm not a particularly physical person .
 I know .
 When I was little , and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up ,
 I 'd always say , " A brain in a jar . "
 Sure .
 Yeah , but I want to be a good husband to you , and intimacy is a part of that .
 Please put those down .
 I 'm just worried that if I don 't schedule our bedroom endeavors , then I may not think about them , and you 'll grow cold and distant and seek solace in the arms of a heavily- muscled longshoreman .

 Where would I find a longshoreman ? Along the shore . It 's in the name .


 Sheldon , I could never be with anybody but you .
 That 's good to know .
 I wouldn 't want to fight a man who 's brave enough to touch a fish .
 How 's this for a compromise ?
 Make all the schedules you want , just don 't tell me about them .
 Excellent . I 'll create an algorithm that 'll generate a pseudo- random schedule .
 Yeah , and do you know why it won 't be a true random schedule ?
 Because the generation of true random numbers remains an unsolved problem in computer science .
 Come with me .
 Where are we going ?
 To the hotel room .
 And when we get there , I 'm gonna need you to say that again , except naked .






 Go for Dr. K.
 NElL deGRASSE TYSON Is this Rajesh Koothrappali ?
 Yes .
 Who is this ?
 Neil deGrasse Tyson .



 W- wow .
 How fun is this Twitter thing ?
 You think you 're funny ?
 I 'm- I 'm not Seinfeld funny , but I did an open mic night once .
 You 're not funny .
 Yeah , that 's what they said at the Chuckle Hut .
 How about this I 've got a book signing at Vroman 's in Pasadena next week .
 Why don 't you come by and say some of those things to my face .
 No , but thanks for the invite .
 Smart move , and the next time you pick up your phone , remember , I 'm the guy who kicked Pluto out of the solar system .
 And it deserved it , sir .
 Thank you .
 Bye- bye .
 Well , that was fun .
 Let 's see who else needs a deGrasse kickin ' .
 Bill Nye the Science Guy .
 Hey , Bill , Neil Tyson .
 We 've got to talk .
