 I have a special treat for y 'all today . My dear friend and former college roommate is here from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to talk to us about our space program .

 And yeah , I know what you 're thinking .
 These guys were roomies .
 How does one go on to be a ... a fancy scientist at NASA , and the other 's teaching freshman science at a public high school ?

 Yeah , Sheldon .
 I was thinking that .
 Thank you .
 All right , let 's give a warm welcome to my good buddy , Dr. Ronald Hodges .
 Hey , kids .
 Hey . Glad to be here .

 And , Hubert , the answer to your question is , one of those roomies was busy studying while the other was out chasing high school girls .

 Yeah .
 To be clear , they were all over 18 . Yeah . Well ...
 Now , what I thought would be fun to talk about today is what NASA 's planning on doing beyond the space shuttle .

 Things like the first manned mission to Mars .
 Yeah .
 Did you see the movie I did .
 Did you think it was cool ?

 Sure , I enjoyed it . Me , too .
 Football player , right ?
 Yes , sir . Yeah .
 Now , of course , before we can set out to explore the solar system , we 've got a few minor problems to overcome .
 Not the least of which is , every time we launch , it costs the U. S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars .
 No , no , no .
 Yes .
 If you want to save money , why don 't you land the booster rockets instead of letting them drop in the ocean ?

 That 's a cute idea , but , it 's not technically possible .
 Why not ?
 Well , it 's hard to explain . The math is pretty complicated .
 Perhaps I could help you with it .
 Well ,
 I bet you could .
 I 'll bet you could .
 I 'll tell you what .
 Here is a NASA patch .
 Why don 't you have your mom sew that on your book bag ?
 Now , who here wants to know how astronauts go to the bathroom ? - Me . I do .
 - Right .
 See , now , during liftoff , all the astronauts wear diapers .



 Yeah , perhaps when .
 Captain Kirk said , " To boldly go , " he meant in one of those ?

 Yeah , that 's right . Beam me up , Potty !









 Why ?
 I 'm putting together my last will and testament .
 We 're gonna miss ya . George .
 Don 't worry .
 I ain 't leaving him squat .
 Are you dyin ' ?
 We 're all dyin ' , honey .
 From the second we 're born , it 's just a slip and slide into the darkness .
 Unless you get bit by a vampire .
 Well , now that goes without saying .
 I don 't want to die . I 've only kissed one boy so far .
 What ?
 Relax .
 It was a long time ago .
 Are you relaxed ?
 Shelly , you haven 't touched your dinner .
 You feel okay ? Yes .
 I was just thinking .
 About what , baby ?
 The optimal heighttowidth ratio for a reusable rocket .
 I was just thinking the exact same thing . Really ?
 Moonpie , I love you so much .

 It 's late .
 What are you doing up ?
 I 'm working on the hyperbolic calculations for a rocket return .
 Need any help ? What ?
 I 'm kiddin ' .
 Now , turn out the light and go to bed .
 But ...
 Now .
 Dad , can we afford a computer ? You do my taxes .
 What do you think ?
 Never mind .
 Good night .
 Meemaw ?
 Mr. Moonpie , how might I help you ?
 How much money are you planning to leave me when you die ?
 Nice talkin ' to you .
 Meemaw ?
 Want to try that again ?
 I need to buy a computer so I can solve the NavierStokes equation .
 How much is a computer ?
 Apple has a nice one for $2, 000 , but the kind I need costs three million .
 Let me see what I got in the vault .
 Nine bucks and ...
 Look at that ... a peso .
 It 's warm .
 Hello , First National Bank .
 I 'd like to speak with a loan officer .
 It 's regarding a second mortgage on my home .
 My name is Sheldon Lee Cooper . Sure , I 'll hold .
 I hate hold music .
 Hello .
 Yes , you can help me , Dorothy Fitzpatrick .
 I 'm interested in taking out a second mortgage . I 'm nine years old .
 Why do you ask ?
 That 's called age discrimination , Dorothy , but I 'm willing to let it slide .
 I 'm glad you find me cute , but I 'm deadly serious .
 I need funds to buy a computer .
 No , the house isn 't in my name . I 'm nine .
 We 've established this .
 I do prepare the taxes for my parents , and if we tighten our belts , we 'll have sufficient equity for the loan .
 Sheldon , who are you talking to ?
 Dorothy Fitzpatrick .
 Who 's Dorothy Fitzpatrick ?
 Is she a new buddy from school ?
 She 's the loan officer at The First National Bank of Medford . Why are you talking to her ?
 Mom , can this wait ?
 I 'm trying to negotiate favorable terms . Hello .
 Dorothy ?

 Hey , how come you weren 't in math class ?
 That guy from NASA treated me like a child , and I need to prove him wrong .
 You a child .
 Tread lightly , my friend .
 Was Ms. Ingram upset I wasn 't in class ?
 Actually , she was happy .
 She even did a little dance .
 Do you know anybody with a modem ?
 I think Radio Shack has one . Why ?
 I need to access thrusttoweight ratios from the FTP server at the Johnson Space Center .
 Then what ?
 Then I show that guy from NASA my work and laugh as he begs for mercy .
 You know , sometimes you sound like a super villain . Silence !
 That 'll be more effective after your voice changes .
 Silence .
 Mom , can you take me to Radio Shack ? Not today , baby .
 I have to go food shopping and get dinner started .
 But it 's important . Sorry .
 Maybe over the weekend .
 But it won 't take that long .
 Sheldon , I said no .
 But , Mom ... Not another word . What ?
 Can 't I just be happy ?

 Mom , please ! Sheldon Lee , I said no .
 I 'm still happy .

 Please , Mom !
 You 're being unfair !
 No .
 But I really need those thrusttoweight ratios .
 Do you see I 'm cookin ' ?
 Well , take me dinner . Enough !
 I 'm not takin ' you anywhere tonight .

 Cheese and crackers !


 All right , I finally got him calmed down . How 'd you manage that ?
 Easy .
 Gave him a hug and a little cough syrup .
 Mom !
 It 's not like he 's operating heavy machinery .
 We can 't keep putting up with this behavior .
 We need to ground him .
 How ?
 If you say " No playing outside , " he says , " Thank you . "
 Well , we need to do something .
 It 's just a tantrum .
 It 's what kids do .
 You used to punish me all the time .
 That was different .
 You were a pain in the ass .
 I say no Radio Shack for at least a month .
 Sounds fair .
 I 'll go tell him .
 I 'd wait and tell him tomorrow .
 He 's a little loopy right now .

 Good night .
 She drugged our son .


 Mom .
 What 's going on ?
 Something 's wrong with Sheldon .

 What 's the matter , baby ? Have a tummy ache ?
 I think it 's an ulcer .
 Don 't be silly .
 You must have eaten something .
 No .
 My symptoms are consistent with an ulcer .
 Shelly , remember when you thought you had leprosy , and it was just a patch of dry skin ?
 And when you thought you had gout ?
 Or an enlarged prostate ?
 Or mad cow ?
 That was my favorite .
 Well , this is different .
 Maybe we should take him to the doctor .
 Listen to your wife ...
 Ulcers are serious .
 Well , I 've never seen this in someone so young , but , your son has an ulcer .
 Thank you .
 How could this happen ?
 There are a number of factors .
 Has he been under some unusual stress lately ?
 Yes .
 She won 't take me to Radio Shack .
 Go wait outside .
 I 've heard some interesting research about treating ulcers with antimicrobials .
 Go .
 And you 're surprised I have an ulcer .
 I 'm surprised don 't have one .
 Um , Radio Shack ?
 He 's trying to figure out how to help NASA land rockets . Well , that 's a nice thing .

 He 's just doing it out of spite .
 Okay .
 Well , keep him off spicy foods for the time being , and I 'll write you a prescription for Zantac .
 Does he smoke ?
 ' Course not .
 He 's nine .
 I started at his age .
 But only when I drank .
 What the ... ?

 Sheldon !
 What are you doing ?
 I just need a minute .
 These things are so slow .
 Is this your family ?
 They 're lovely .

 Mom .
 What ? There 's something wrong with Sheldon again .


 I figured it out !
 One night .
 I want to sleep one night .
 Hi , Mom .













 Something 's wrong with Sheldon again .
 Now what ?
 Those people at NASA never responded to his science stuff .
 Damn it .
 I 've had enough of this .
 Sheldon , get up .
 What 's the point ?
 We 're going to Houston .
 Really ?
 Yeah .
 You and me are gonna give those space monkeys a little talkin ' to .


 I don 't see why I couldn 't stay home . ' Cause we 're having a fun family outin ' .
 Can I at least drive ?
 She said fun , not tragic .
 Let 's go to the ostrich farm .
 Cool . We can ride 'em , and then we can eat 'em .

 We 're not stopping anywhere .
 We 're going to Houston to straighten this thing out for your brother , then we 're going home .
 Shelly , you doing okay ? Yes .
 I just hope I don 't get carsick .
 You want Daddy to pull over ?
 I 'll be okay .



 Yeah , I don 't mean to be rude , but we 've been waitin ' for an hour to see your boss .
 I 'm sorry , sir , but you didn 't have an appointment .
 We didn 't have an appointment 'cause every time I called , you put me on hold .
 I 'm sure Dr. Hodges 'll see you as soon as he can .
 So , what do you want to do ?
 I don 't know .
 I guess we just got to be patient and wait ...
 Aw , screw it !
 Excuse me , sir , you can 't just ...
 All right , here 's the deal .
 My kid 's got a damn ulcer 'cause of you , so either you take him seriously , or you 're gonna be taking seriously .

 Yes , sir ?
 Janice , why don 't you send the little boy in ?
 Right away .
 He 'll see you now .
 You 're up , Moonpie .

 And here ... near apogee , we gimbal the engine to exert a torque that executes a pitchover maneuver to flip the rocket by 180 degrees .

 Well , that 's very impressive .
 Thank you very much for taking the time ...
 I 'm not done .

 Sorry .
 Needless to say , we use a P. I. D. controller to minimize the dispersions to the landing site .
 Anything else ?
 Yes .
 I 'd like a glass of water .
 It 's time to take my Zantac .

 He 's been in there quite a while .
 Well , if the topic is science , he can be a really Chatty Patty .
 I 'm bored . Me , too .
 Hey .
 Someday somebody 's gonna write a book about Sheldon .
 Don 't you want there to be a chapter about how loving and supportive you two were ?
 Doesn 't matter . I ain 't reading it .


 This is groundbreaking work .
 Thank you . And ... ?
 And ... ?
 I thought you might want to apologize .
 Well ... why ?
 You tried to shut me up with a patch .
 Well ... II give those to everyone .
 AAnd you have to understand , Sheldon , that while your math isis theoretically correct , we don 't have the technical capability to execute it .

 So I 'm ahead of my time ?
 Well ... it would appear so .
 All right , call me when you catch up .
 W ...
 We can go now .



 Dad ? Yeah ?
 Thank you .
 You 're welcome .
 We 're real proud of you , honey .
 Are you proud of me and Georgie ?
 Of course . You bet .
 For what ?
 Don 't go pokin ' at it .







 Elon , the CNN reporter 's here to talk to you .
 Hang on .
 Send him in .
