 - Are you sure Hacker 's the man for this ?
 - Yes . He 's the best choice to bring in an integrated transport policy ? !

 - Yes . - But he knows nothing about it !

 No .
 - You 've sounded out the Transport Secretary ?
 - He won 't touch it .
 - Yes .
 This could turn out to be a bed of nails .
 - A crown of thorns .
 - A booby trap .
 - It has to look like something 's going to be done .
 It calls for a particular combination of talents , lots of activity but no actual achievement .
 I see .
 Then Hacker IS the man !
 So how do we go about him ?
 Well , you 're the PM 's Chief Special Advisor .
 You know the form .
 We make it seem like a special honour .
 A promotion .
 A present .
 But Sir Humphrey will tell Hacker he 'd be crazy to do it .
 Yes .
 " Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes , " I can hear him say .
 " Beware of Greeks bearing gifts , " roughly translated .
 Humphrey would have put it in English for Hacker 's benefit .
 Hacker went to the LSE .
 - So did I. - Oh , I AM sorry .
 We must get an immediate commitment from Hacker before he talks to Humphrey .
 - Today ? Now ?
 - Don 't you think it 'll work ?
 Flattering a politician ?
 When 's it ever failed ?
 We 'll offer to call him Transport Supremo , shall we ?
 Yes , much more attractive than Transport Muggins !
 Ah , Jim !
 Hello , Mark .
 - Arnold .
 - Drink ?
 Yes , thank you .
 - Everything all right ?
 - Everything 's fine .
 We wanted ...
 Er , that is , the Prime Minister wanted the Cabinet Secretary and me to sound you out about something ... ... something of an honour , I may say .

 - Honour ?
 You don 't mean ... kicked up there ?
 - No , no .
 A real honour .
 A significant increase of responsibility .
 Now , what are your views on the Integrated National Transport Policy ?
 Er ...
 I ...
 I ...
 Well , er ...
 I ...
 Go on .
 The PM has decided we need a national transport policy .
 Yes . Well .
 Why not ?
 You 're in favour ?
 Unfortunately , public dissatisfaction with the nationalised transport industries is now at a high enough level to worry the government , as you know .
 Can you go on ?
 - No , we can 't go on , not like this .
 - We need a policy .
 Not just blame the management if there 's an R in the month and the unions the rest of the time .
 Unfortunately , they 've got together .
 Their line is it 's the government 's fault .
 Everything that goes wrong is the result of not having an integrated policy .
 - We did have a policy before .
 - Did we ?
 Yes , it was our policy not to have a policy .
 Well , now the PM wants a positive policy .
 Oh , the PM .
 Yes , well , er ...
 - I couldn 't agree more .
 I 've always thought so .
 - Good .
 Surely it 's a Ministry of Transport matter ?
 No .
 Obviously the Transport Secretary would love the job , but he 's too close to it all .
 - Can 't see the wood for the trees . - It needs an open mind , uncluttered .
 So the PM has decided to appoint a supremo to develop and implement a national transport policy .
 - Supremo ?
 - A supremo .
 And ...
 Exactly .
 - It was agreed you had the most open mind .
 - And the most uncluttered .
 Of course it 's a great honour and a responsibility .
 Er , but what ... What sort of ...
 Er ...
 I mean ...
 You mean what is required of an integrated transport policy minister ?
 - It 's to help the consumer . - Very popular with the public .

 - Not that that would ... - No , of course not .
 It 's my duty .
 For example , the motorways were planned without reference to the railways , so there are great stretches of motorway running alongside already existing railways .
 - While other areas aren 't served at all . - Quite . We knew you 'd understand .

 - It 's really quite simple .
 - Yes .
 - Then there 's through tickets .
 - Through tickets ... ?
 If you want to commute from Henley to the City , you need one British Rail ticket to Paddington and then an Underground ticket to the Bank .
 Have you ever seen a combined bus and railway timetable ?
 Or ever seen a bus timetable in a railway station ?
 Has a bus driver ever seen a bus timetable ?
 There 's a British Rail Western Region line running less than a mile north of Heathrow , but no link line .
 Bus and train services don 't connect , all over London .
 - And outside London there are problems .
 - Probably . But we don 't know about them .

 It 's full of possibilities .
 I suppose you 'd like me to discuss it with Humphrey and come back ?
 There is much to discuss with Sir Humphrey , but we need an indication of your response now .
 The PM 's car leaves for the airport in 30 minutes .
 The Ottowa conference .
 - Then the United Nations speech in New York .
 - Then Washington .
 Gosh , what a long trip .
 Who 's going to run the country ?
 Sorry , Arnold . Silly question .

 - So we can give the PM the good news ? - There 's a lot to put in hand .

 - Oh , yes . I 'm on . - Splendid !
 Have another drink .
 - Ah , Minister . - Sorry I 'm late .

 - Got some splendid news .
 - Indeed , Minister ?
 - I have a new job . - The department will be sorry to lose you .

 No , I mean an extra job .
 I 've been asked to develop an integrated national transport policy by the Prime Minister .
 I see .
 And what was the good news ?
 That WAS the good news .
 Oh .
 Then how , if I may be so bold as to enquire ,
 - would you describe bad news ?
 - What ?
 Do you realise what this job would mean if you accept it ?
 - I have accepted it .
 - You 've what ?
 - I HAVE accepted it . - Minister , you 're not serious !
 Yes , it 's an honour .
 We need a transport policy .
 If by " we " you mean Britain , that 's quite true .
 But if by " we " you mean this department , we need a transport policy like an aperture in the cranial cavity !
 It is a bed of nails !
 - I know it may cause extra administrative duties .
 - Minister , that is not the point .
 The reason there 's no integrated transport policy is that it 's in everybody 's interest except the minister who creates it .
 Why ?
 How can I put it in a manner which is close to your heart ?
 - It is the ultimate vote loser .
 - Vote loser ?
 Why do you think the Transport Secretary isn 't doing it ?
 Why did he suggest the Lord Privy Seal ?
 Why did the Lord Privy Seal suggest the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster ,
 - who suggested the President of the Council ?
 - I didn 't know this .
 And why did they invite you to No .
 10 behind my back ?
 Minister , this hideous appointment has been hurtling round Whitehall for three weeks
 like a grenade with the pin taken out !
 If I pull it off , it 'll be a feather in my cap .
 If you pull it off , Minister , it won 't be in your cap any more .
 Thank you , Bernard .
 If you pull it off , no one will feel the benefits for ten years .
 - Long before that , you and I will have moved on .
 - Or up .
 - Or out . - Out ?


 In the meantime , formulating policy means making choices .
 Once you do that , you please the people that you favour , but infuriate everybody else .
 One vote gained , ten lost .
 If you give the job to the road services , the rail board and unions will scream .
 Give it to the railways , the road lobby will massacre you .
 Cut British Airways investment plans , they 'll hold a devastating press conference that same day .
 But I 'm going to be Transport Supremo !
 I believe the Civil Service vernacular is Transport Muggins !
 No , the Prime Minister has asked me to undertake this task , this necessary duty .
 After all , we must all endeavour to do our duty .
 Furthermore , Sir Mark thinks there may be votes in it .
 - I won 't look a gift horse in the mouth .
 - You 're looking a Trojan horse in the mouth !
 If we look closely at this gift horse we 'll find it full of Trojans ?
 If you 'd looked a Trojan horse in the mouth , you 'd have found Greeks inside .
 It was the Greeks who gave the Trojan horse to the Trojans .
 Technically , it wasn 't a Trojan horse but a Greek horse .
 Hence the tag " Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes , " which , you 'll recall , is usually and somewhat inaccurately translated , " Beware Greeks bearing gifts , " or doubtless you would have recalled had you not attended the LSE .


 Greek tags are all very well , but can we stick to the point ?
 - Yes ...
 - Sorry , Greek tags ?
 " Beware Greeks bearing gifts . "
 The EEC equivalent would be , " Beware Greeks bearing an olive oil surplus " !
 - Excellent .
 - No , the point is , Minister , just as the Trojan horse was Greek , what you call a Greek tag is , in fact , Latin .
 The Greeks wouldn 't suggest bewaring of themselves , if one can use such a participle , and it 's clearly Latin not because " Timeo " ends in " o " , as the Greek first person also ends in " o " .

 No , there is a Greek word " Timao " meaning " I honour " , but the " os " ending is a nominative singular termination of a second declension in Greek and an accusative plural in Latin , though actually Danaos is not only the Greek for Greek , it 's also the Latin for Greek .


 Yes , I take your point , Humphrey , but is it really as bad as that ?
 Minister , perhaps ...
 Perhaps you will allow me to prove it to you .
 I will arrange a preliminary conference for you with three Under- Secretaries from the Department of Transport ,
 - from the roads , rail and air transport divisions .
 - What will that prove ?
 It may illustrate some problems you will encounter .
 You may be right , Humphrey .
 But if I succeed , this could be my Falkland Islands .
 Yes .
 And you could be General Galtieri !
 With respect , Minister , I feel constrained to point out the proposal is deeply misguided .
 - So what do you suggest ?
 - I suggest it should be government policy to designate road haulage as its principal means of freight transport .
 If I might crave your indulgence for a moment ,
 I think such a policy would be , not to put too fine a point on it , unacceptably short- sighted .
 Rail transport must surely be the favoured carrier under any sane national policy .
 With the greatest respect , both those proposals are formulae for disaster .
 Long- term considerations mandate the increase of air freight .
 If the minister wants a massive budget increase ...
 If the minister accepts a long , bitter rail strike ...
 If the minister can tolerate a massive rise in public discontent ...
 Hold on !
 - We are the government , aren 't we ? - Indeed you are , Minister .

 - So we 're all on the same side . - Indeed , no question .

 Doing what 's best for Britain .
 Is the end of the air freight business best for Britain ?
 How is Britain served by the destruction of the railways ?
 How does Britain benefit from a deterioration of the road network ?
 I want to examine policy options for the government 's freight transport needs .
 I thought a preliminary discussion , a few friends around the table , a few positive suggestions ...
 - An expansion of rail transport ...
 - An expansion of motorway construction ...
 - An expansion of air freight capacity . - I need to achieve a reduction in costs .

 - Then there is only one possible course .
 - Indeed there is .
 And there 's no doubt what it is .
 Good .
 I always like to end on a note of agreement .
 Thank you , gentlemen .
 Minister .
 Perhaps we could discuss a date for our next meeting . This way , please .
 That was a very frank meeting .
 More than frank , Minister . Frank bordering on direct .
 - The cleaners will mop up the blood tomorrow .
 - Bernard , can you help me ?
 - How , Minister ? - Under- Secretaries are civil servants .
 But they behave like counsel briefed by the transport interests to defeat the government .
 - That 's right . - No , Bernard , that 's wrong .

 That 's how it works .
 Each department is controlled by the people it 's supposed to control .
 - How do you mean ?
 - Why do we have comprehensive education ?
 - Who wanted it ? Pupils , parents ?
 - Not really .
 The National Union of Teachers , the chief client of the Department of Education , so the DES went comprehensive .
 Departments act for the powerful interest with whom they have a permanent relationship .
 The Department of Employment lobbies for the TUC .
 The Department of Industry lobbies for the employers . It 's a nice balance .
 Energy lobbies for oil companies , Defence for the armed forces , the Home Office for the police .
 So the system aims to stop the Cabinet carrying out its policies ?
 Well , somebody 's got to !
 So formulating a national transport policy means fighting not just the transport industry but the entire Civil Service as well ?
 Shouldn 't the Civil Service help the government carry out its wishes ?
 Well , as long as the government 's wishes are practicable .
 - Meaning ?
 - As long as the Civil Service agrees with them !
 Useful meeting , Minister .
 All right , Humphrey .
 You win .
 - What do I win ? - We must get out of our commitments .

 Clearly the title Transport Supremo is not worth having .
 - We must change the Prime Minister 's mind .
 - Is that " we " plural , or do supremos now use the royal pronoun ?
 I mean both of us , Humphrey , unless you want the DAA saddled with this .
 - So , what are you suggesting ?
 - Bernard , find a map of the PM 's constituency .
 - Humphrey , I need some advice .
 - Yes , Minister ?
 Could the formulation of a national transport policy have unwanted local repercussions ?
 Er , yes , indeed , Minister .
 Even in a constituency represented by a very senior member of the government ,
 - the MOST senior member of the government ?
 - Deeply embarrassing !
 - Here 's the street map and the directory .
 - Splendid .
 This is the Prime Minister 's constituency , isn 't it ?
 Oh , look , a park !
 Near the station .
 One requirement of a transport policy is to bring bus stations nearer to railway stations .
 - But that would mean building on the park .
 - Alas , yes .
 Somebody has to suffer in the national interest .
 Take a note , Bernard .
 Bus station to be moved into Queen Charlotte 's Park .
 Oh , Minister , there 's a big bus repair shop .
 Isn 't it economic to amalgamate the bus and train repairs ?
 - Absolutely .
 Big saving .
 - Bus repair shop to be closed , Bernard .
 - This is commuter country , what about that ?
 - Commuter trains run at a loss .
 They 're only really used at rush hours .
 So commuters are , in effect , subsidised .
 - Isn 't that unfair on the others ? - It 's a great injustice .
 Commuters to pay full economic fares , Bernard .
 - Mind , that 'll double the price of tickets .
 - Can 't make an omelette without breaking eggs !
 There are quite a few railway stations in this area .
 British Rail and Underground .
 Yes ?
 One view is that areas with reasonable rail services don 't need an evening bus service too .
 A very persuasive view , to my mind .
 All bus services to cease after 6 . 30pm .
 What about this space when the bus station 's moved to the park ?
 Well , the area 's very short of parking space for container lorries ... ... especially at night .
 Container lorry park on bus station site , Bernard .
 - Won 't that mean widening this access road ?
 - Yes , indeed .
 We 'll have to take away the western half of the swimming baths .
 I 'm afraid so .
 Of course , these are just the local implications of a broad national policy .
 Exactly , Minister .
 Even so , I ought to write a paper to the Prime Minister personally .
 He 'd like to know the constituency implications .
 As a loyal Cabinet member , I owe that to the PM ... amongst other things !
 Mind you , it would be awful if the press got hold of this .
 With so many other boroughs threatened , there 'd be a national outcry .
 - Is there a danger of them getting hold of it ?
 - They 're very clever at getting hold of things .
 - Especially if there are lots of copies . - Oh , dear !

 I shall have to make copies for my Cabinet colleagues .
 Their own constituencies will be affected in due course .
 And if it were leaked , with so many copies , no one would ever discover who leaked it .
 It so happens I 'm having lunch today with Peter Maxwell of The Times .
 Excellent !
 Em , don 't do anything I wouldn 't do .
 You can trust me , Minister !
 I 'm sure you 've heard rumours , Peter , of this integrated transport policy .
 - That old chestnut coming up again ? - Yes , but in an interesting form .

 - The policy may have unwelcome side effects .
 - Such as ?
 Job loss from integration of bus and rail terminals , job loss from joint repair shops , job loss from streamlining of buses and trains , and reduction of services , causing job loss .

 That 's just for starters .
 If this is being seriously proposed , it 's quite a story .
 - Even more interesting than you think .
 - How 's that ?
 One of the areas to suffer most is the Prime Minister 's own constituency .
 Have you any hard facts ?
 Dear Peter , what a question !
 Newspapers aren 't like the government .
 If we make statements , we have to prove them .
 Got something in writing ? There always is in the Civil Service .

 Only a confidential note from my minister to the Prime Minister and a similar note from my minister to all 22 of his Cabinet colleagues .
 Oh , that 's all right , then .
 Will you show it to me or shall I get it from one of the others ?
 Peter , it 's a confidential document .
 It would be grossly improper of me to betray it to anyone
 - let alone a journalist . - Of course .

 The only way you 'd get hold of a copy is if someone were to leave it lying around by mistake .
 I see .
 Oh , well , back to the grindstone .
 Well , nice to talk , Peter . Thank you for the lunch .

 - Thank you .
 - Goodbye .
 Oh , Humphrey , you are SO careless !
 Hmm ?
 Ah , Jim . Thanks for dropping in .

 I thought I ought to tell you that the PM isn 't very pleased .
 - Oh , not pleased ? - Not pleased .

 - This story in last Tuesday 's Times . - Yes , terrible .
 I 'm not pleased either .
 - There 's obviously been a leak . - Obviously .

 - Can 't even trust Cabinet colleagues .
 - What are you suggesting ?
 Well , it might not have been one of them .
 I sent a copy of my paper here to No . 10 .
 You don 't think there 's a leak here , do you ?
 - The PM 's office does not leak ! - Of course not .
 Perish the thought !
 It wasn 't just the leak that was disturbing .
 It was the misleading implications of the proposals .
 - No , not misleading .
 Have you read my paper ?
 - Have you read mine ?
 - This is the paper from the PM 's constituency .
 - I believe it is .
 " PM steps in to stop transport reorganisation proposals .
 " Rumours that services and jobs were threatened in this constituency were scotched today .
 " Apparently the PM has given a firm direction to Transport Supremo designate Jim Hacker . "
 - I haven 't heard from the Prime Minister .
 - You have now !
 I 'm afraid this leak , wherever it comes from , is a verbatim report of a confidential minute dictated by the PM in Ottowa .
 So , the national transport policy will need some re- thinking !
 It will be difficult .
 The PM feels it 's the difficult jobs that the ministers are there for ,
 - assuming they wish to remain as ministers .
 - Yes , well , of course .
 - If it needs , er ...
 - Rethinking . ... rethinking , then of course I shall rethink .
 Good .
 But how did this get into the PM 's own local paper ?
 I don 't know . But the PM 's office does not leak .

 Shocking , though , isn 't it ? You can 't trust anyone nowadays .

 Back to square one .
 Well , that 's all right .
 It is NOT all right .
 It means I 'm still stuck with this ghastly job .
 No , Minister , it is excellent news .
 We now present our other kind of non- proposal .
 - What other kind ? - The high cost , high staff kind .

 We now propose a British National Transport Authority with a full structure , regional board , area council , local office , liaison committee , the lot .
 80, 000 staff , billion- a- year budget .
 The Treasury will have a fit !
 The whole thing will go back to the Department of Transport .
 Great .
 Could you do me a paper on this , Humphrey , with full staff and costing details and a specimen annual budget ?
 There 's a one- page summary on the front .
 - Humphrey , you 're marvellous . - It 's nothing , really .
 I say , what if the press should get hold of this !
 - They 'd have to have another leak enquiry .
 - Will they really set up an enquiry ?
 - Bound to . - Won 't that be embarrassing ?


 No , no , no . That 's what leak enquiries are for .

 Setting up . They don 't actually conduct them .

 Members may be appointed , but they 'll never meet , and certainly never report .
 How many leak enquiries can you recall that named the culprit ?
 - In round figures . - If you want it in round figures ... ... none .
 - They never report .

 If the culprit is a civil servant , it 'd be unfair to publish .
 Politicians take the rap .
 If it 's a politician , you can 't publish or he 'll disclose other leaks by his colleagues .
 But chiefly they can 't publish because most leaks come from No .
 10 .
 The ship of state , Bernard , is the only ship that leaks from the top .
 So , if the problem is a leaky PM , as in this case , the facts are difficult to get at and impossible to publish if you do !
 May I remind you , a gentleman from the press is waiting .
 - Ah , yes . - I 'll leave you , Minister .

 - Oh , er , Humphrey ...
 - Minister ? ... have you got another copy of these new proposals ?

 Of course !
 - There . - Because I 'm awfully absent- minded .

 I 'm always leaving documents lying around ... ... forgetting where I 've put them .
 I do understand , Minister !
 - Another leak . This is extremely serious .

 - Yes , indeed .
 This is almost approaching a disciplinary level .
 - I so agree , don 't you , Humphrey ? - Indeed , Minister .

 If only we could find the culprits .
 It would be a most serious matter .
 Perhaps I can help there .
 I think that if I were to use my influence ,
 I could achieve a disclosure from The Times of how they got hold of your original plan .
 - Oh ?
 - Really ?
 - I might be able to help there , too .
 - Indeed ?
 - Are you sure , Minister ? - Oh , yes .

 I 'm confident I can find out where the press got the leak about the PM 's opposition to our plan .
 If it transpired the leak came from the Prime Minister 's own office that 'd be even more serious than a leak from a Cabinet Minister 's office .
 I mean , the security implications alone ...
 - Perhaps we should call in the police or Ml5 .
 - Ml5 , good idea , Minister .
 A leak from the Prime Minister 's office is VERY serious .
 Nevertheless , our first priority must be to investigate the original leak .
 Surely we should first investigate a possible leak from No . 10 .

 In all events , the inevitable public outcry after all these leaks will make it awfully difficult for us to formulate an integrated national transport policy in the DAA .
 The time is unripe , the climate is unsuitable .
 The atmosphere is unfavourable .
 Our only avenues of approach are now blocked .
 - I wonder ...
 - Hmm ? ... if it might not be wiser to take the whole matter back to the Department of Transport ?
 - That , Arnold , is a brilliant idea . - I wish I 'd thought of that .

 - There remains the question of the leaks . - Indeed .

 I feel we ought to treat this with the utmost gravity .
 - I think I have a solution .
 - Indeed ?
 Will we recommend to the Prime Minister that we set up an immediate leak enquiry ?
 Yes , Minister !
