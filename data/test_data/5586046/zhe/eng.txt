 It 's nice to get back to nature .
 Why don 't I do this more often ?
 What a beautiful forest .
 ( gasps delightedly )
 Hello , little butterfly .
 What 's your Na ... ( screams )
 Whatcha doing ?
 I was enjoying some virtual reality , until you ruined it with your actual face .
 What am I smelling ?
 Oh , it 's car air freshener .
 I was simulating the smell of the forest .
 That 's not what the forest smells like .
 Well , how would I know ?
 Why are you pretending to be outdoors ?
 You hate it .
 Hmm ?
 Oh .
 Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness .
 Buddy , I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there .
 Well , make your jokes , but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a 50 % gain in reasoning skills upon their return .
 Okay , if that 's true , why aren 't there more genius squirrels ?
 You may need this more than I do .

 Original Air Date on April 7 , 2016



 Here 's your tea .
 Oh !
 Do not sneak up on a guy when he 's sitting on a log .
 You know , if you really want to be in nature , why don 't we rent a cabin ?
 Look , I 'm sorry , when did you even get here ?
 I ...
 You know , there 's a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me .
 Because he 's hitting on you ?
 She .
 Oh , good .
 But I could get her .
 We could all go for the weekend .
 It 'll be fun .
 Yeah ... ( clears throat ) Excuse me .
 Here , look up " fun , " get back to me .
 You and I could still go and have a nice weekend .
 Sure .
 Come on , Sheldon , let 's go with them .
 I hardly think so .
 You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes , bees , bears , snakes , possums , poison oak , oh , and last , but not least , teenagers with guitars .

 I 'll see if it 's available .
 You know , if that study 's real ,
 Leonard might come back smarter than you .
 Are you trying to manipulate me ?
 Yes .
 Well done , it worked , we 're going .
 Yay !
 ( bags rustling ) BERNADETTE :
 Come on , Raj , give me a bag .
 No , no , you 're pregnant .
 The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow .
 Hey , where you been ?
 Uh , Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store .
 ( tires screeching on game ) Did you get graham crackers ?
 I mean , are ... what ... is the baby okay ?
 Yes and yes .
 ( sighs )
 I didn 't know you needed help running errands today .
 I didn 't , but Raj volunteered .
 Really ?
 Yeah , ever since you told him I was pregnant , he 's really been making a fuss over me .
 Oh .
 Well , I guess that 's kind of sweet .
 Bernie , I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles .
 I know my favorite , but I 'd love to hear what you think .
 And it just got weird .
 Hey .
 Amy 's downstairs .
 Okay , one sec .
 Uh , what- what you got goin ' on here ?
 I bought a baseball cap .
 I can see that .
 What team did you get ?
 Uh , Hufflepuff , from
 Well , we 'll be in the woods .
 I 'm ready to go .
 Anything you 'd like to say to
 Nice hat , Sheldon .
 Thanks .
 Why are you so mean to me ?
 ( woman screaming in pain )
 ( screaming continues )
 What the hell are you watching ?
 Raj found all these childbirth videos online .
 This one is of a woman giving birth in a river .
 Okay , that is the least Jewish thing
 I 've ever seen in my life .
 You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff ?
 I don 't think so .
 He just wants to be part of the experience .
 All right , if you say so .
 What 's in the box ?
 Oh , it 's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby 's heartbeat .
 Oh .
 That 's cool .
 Can we try it ?
 Actually , Raj ordered it .
 He made me promise to wait till he was here .
 So he can be ... part of the experience ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm surprised he let us conceive without him .
 It 's a sore spot -- don 't bring it up .
 It 's so cute and rustic up here .
 I know .
 Did you see they still have a video rental place ? it 's like Colonial Williamsburg .
 Well ... cell service is down to one bar , so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid , now 's the time .



 Have you ever been off the grid before ?
 Once .
 The battery ran out on my phone .
 I had to wait for my iPad to turn on .
 I was afraid he was gonna eat me .
 Raj just pulled up .
 I 'm gonna say something to him .
 Leave it alone .
 He means well .
 So you don 't think he needs to rein it in a little ?
 No , not really .
 And you 're not concerned he 's acting like somehow this is his kid , too ?
 He 's just trying to be supportive .
 Just supportive .
 Not over- the- top in any way ?
 No .
 KOOTHRAPPALl : Hello !
 You saw him carrying that .
 Astronauts saw him carrying that .
 ( gasps )
 This place is great !
 So nice of that doctor to just let you use it .
 Well , she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert , so hold that thought .
 Okay .
 Well , should we check each other for ticks ?
 Sheldon , all we did was walk in from the car .
 Oh .
 Well , suit yourself .
 Who wants to check me ?
 On the other hand , safety first .
 ( rain falling loudly )
 Wow , it 's really coming down .
 This sucks .
 And there goes our hike .
 Oh , not our hike !
 Now we have to stay safe and warm .
 You know , we could still go .
 A little rain isn 't gonna kill us .
 Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon ?
 No .
 You 'll wish it would kill you .
 So what do we do now ?
 They have some board games .
 Eh , most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles , so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word " SHNERPF " next to it , move on .

 Hey , let 's light a fire .
 Ooh , that sounds cozy .
 I don 't think I 've lit a real fire before .
 Ah , it 's basic thermodynamics .
 I 'm sure we can figure that out .
 I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow .
 That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion .
 ( fire whooshes ) Right .
 So all we need is to ...
 Got it .
 A scientist made that .
 Look , Raj , you 're my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby .
 Please , my pleasure .
 And , of course , Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this .
 But we have to set some boundaries .
 I don 't understand .
 The three of us aren 't having this baby .
 Just the two of us .
 Oh ...
 Okay .
 Yeah , I get it .
 I 'll back off .
 Thanks for understanding .
 Of course .
 I 'll give you guys some space .
 Let me just get this out of your way .
 You need some help ?
 No , I got it .
 ( clattering ) ( grunts )
 Raj ...
 Raj , wait .
 Please , Bernadette .
 Let me leave with my dignity .
 ( thumps )
 Hey , you guys want to play a drinking game ?
 Oh , well now , well now , we 'll never win .
 You always play the drinking game .
 Not drinking game , drinking game .
 To be fair , good at both .
 What 's the game ?
 All right , it 's called Never Have I Ever .
 The rules are simple .
 Someone says something they 've never done , but if you have done it , you take a drink .
 I 've never played that before .
 ( stammers ) Hey , now , wait .
 Have we started ?
 Do I drink ?
 What is happening ?
 Okay .
 Calm down .
 I 'll go first .
 All right , let 's see .
 Never have I ever ...
 She 's trying to think of something she 's never done before .
 This could take a while .
 Very funny .
 Okay , never have I ever ...
 Yeah , you know what ?
 Let 's just circle back .
 Okay , I 'll go .
 Never have I ever been arrested .
 So I drink .
 No , it 's only if you 've done it .
 Got it .
 I can 't believe you 've been arrested .
 I can 't believe Penny hasn 't .
 Sheldon , what did you do ?
 Well , I 'm not proud of it , but ...
 I jaywalked .
 Oh , no , it 's like a horror movie .
 We 're trapped in a cabin with a maniac .
 I 'm surprised you would do that .
 No , I crossed in the middle of the street .
 And normally , I wouldn 't , but I saw an aggressive- looking Girl Scout , and it was the heart of cookie season .
 Anyway , there was a police officer , and he witnessed the whole thing .
 What -- he arrested you for that ?
 ( stammers ) No , he didn 't do anything .
 So I said , " You just saw me jaywalk .
 Why aren 't you doing your job ? "
 You know ?
 " M- Maybe I should arrest you for- for impersonating a police officer . "
 And then you got arrested .
 Oh , and how .
 I feel like I just made a horrible mistake .
 Yeah .
 But on the other hand ,
 I didn 't kick him out of our lives .
 I just asked him to back off a little .
 Yeah .
 What ?
 Are you gonna cry ?
 ( crying ) :
 Yeah !
 Is it baby hormones or actually sad ?
 I can 't tell anymore !
 I 'll go get him .
 And bring back the bear !
 This game 's dangerous .
 I could get you in trouble .
 How ?
 Well , never have I ever used Sheldon 's toothbrush to clean the sink .
 Fine , is that how you want to play this ?
 All right , never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals .
 Never should 've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks .
 AMY : Okay .
 My turn .
 Um ...
 Never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend 's world in bed .
 ( stammers ) Amy ...
 You know the rules .
 Drink .
 ( clears throat )
 Yeah , go ahead .
 That 's right .
 All right , my turn .
 Mm ...
 Oh , I know .
 Never have I ever kept a secret bank account , because I think my wife can 't handle money .
 Did I win ?
 I feel like I won .
 I can 't believe this .
 You realize I make more money than you ?
 I don 't , I know , but this isn 't a big deal .
 It 's just a little savings I put aside .
 We 're married .
 We 're supposed to share everything .
 What -- you mean , like , your massive credit card debt ?
 ( door slams )
 I 'm calling it .
 I won .
 I appreciate the apology , but it 's really not necessary .
 I overstepped my bounds .
 No , Raj , you 've been great .
 I just , I need to start doing my part around here .
 BERNADETTE : I hear that .
 Well , if that 's the case , is there anything I can do to help ?
 Well , not right now .
 But we could try out that microphone you got us , and listen to the baby 's heartbeat .
 Really ?
 It 's okay if I listen with you ? !
 Of course .
 Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach ?
 Hey , look at that .
 It 's weird again .
 ( door opens )
 Okay , you have every right to be mad .
 And what you said is true .
 You do make more money than me .
 So I had no right to do what I did .
 And I 'm so sorry .
 I hope you can forgive me .
 How long have you had this secret account ?
 A couple years , but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies .
 Well , how much you got in there ? $6, 427 . $47 once my nana 's birthday check gets here .

 My God , Leonard , do you know what I could do with that kind of money ?
 No , I do , and that 's why I hid it .
 What good is it if you don 't use it ?
 Uh , uh , you have shoes you love , but never wear .
 I have money I love , but never spend .
 We 're kind of a cute couple that way .
 Again ,
 I 'm sorry .
 I shouldn 't have kept it a secret .
 Well , I have a secret I 've been keeping from you , too .
 Is it a secret bank account ?
 Because that would be awesome .
 I hate my job .
 Really ?
 Why ?
 Because I don 't feel good flirting with doctors for sales .
 I mean , I know I make a lot of money .
 But I haven 't been happy for a while .
 Why didn 't you tell me ?
 Because I know how important it is to you that I 'm having some success .
 That 's not true .
 Okay , really ?
 So you 'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again ?
 If that 's what you want to do , yes .
 Well , it 's not what I want to do .
 Oh , yes .
 Doesn 't matter what I want .
 Look , this job is gonna get me out of debt .
 So I 'm gonna do the grown- up thing and see it through .
 Well , that is the grown- up thing .
 I guess .
 I love you .
 I love you , too .
 You know , never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining .
 Well , guess I gotta drink .
 All right , here we go .
 ( microphone droning )
 I 'm not hearing anything .
 Well , give me a second .
 Are you sure you can do this ?
 Hey , who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector ?
 I buried it there , so we could go home .
 ( heartbeat echoing , gasps )
 Wait , that 's it .
 Wow .
 Isn 't that the best ?
 You guys made a person .
 We did .
 And I like to think I helped .
 ( whispering ) : You didn 't .
 SHELDON : Oh , let me see .
 Oh , um , never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date .
 Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment .
 Oh , uh , never have I ever put my foot in the ocean .
 Never have I ever honked if I liked anything .
 Oh !
 Uh ... never have I ever thrown , caught or touched a Frisbee .
 Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first .
 Yeah ...
 Oh !
 Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator .
 ( gasps )
 Well , we all have a past .
