 A man was working for me .
 On the legitimate side of my business .
 He was supervising a construction project .
 A German engineer .
 I think you know his name .
 Werner Ziegler .
 Through an oversight ,
 Ziegler became aware of our other activities .
 The temptation was too great for him to resist , and he stole two keys of product .
 I believe you know the rest of the story .
 You know of Ziegler 's escape .
 You know that my man tracked him down .
 My shame ...
 Is not simply that I allowed this to happen .
 It 's that I hid the truth .
 When I discovered what Ziegler had done ,
 I replaced the stolen product with methamphetamine I purchased locally .
 Some of this inferior product went to your organization .

 And for that ...
 I must apologize .

 What construction project ?

 Wow .

 Yeah , uh ...
 I just ... I just don 't know .
 Five months .
 With overcrowding , you 'll probably do less than two .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Considering your priors , sentencing guidelines would have you looking at two to four years in custody .
 So ...
 Five months is really good , Bobby .



 Are you worried about being there when Lois delivers ?
 Delivers ? Oh , right .
 Yeah , yeah , so , um ...
 So , if I go to trial , you 'll be my lawyer , right ?
 Bobby , you do not want to go to trial .
 But you 'll be my lawyer .
 Yes , but going to trial would be a mistake .
 Trials are always unpredictable . At trial , the D. A. will throw everything at us .
 You 'd just be rolling the dice .
 I mean , I don 't mean to tell you your business , Miss Wexler , but you put me up there , Yeah . Roll the dice .
 Yeah .
 I give the people the big eyes , they see Lois here and the kid , y 'know , they gonna believe me .
 I 'd believe you . Bobby , there are a million reasons not to go to trial .

 But it 's up to me , right ?
 Yes , it is , but I 'm advising you not to .
 Odds are you would end up going away for more time , not less .
 And I am talking about years of your life .



 But I might not , right ?

 You don 't want to take that risk .
 Maybe I do . Lois ...
 Whatever Bobby says .

 ( DOOR OPENS ) Excuse me a moment .

 Please ... Think this over carefully .
 Both of you .
 You ready for lunch ?
 There 's a new sandwich vending machine down by family court .
 I 've heard good things .
 Sorry , I 'm stuck here .
 Really ? What 's up ?
 He 's not taking the deal .
 Who ? That guy ? ( SlGHS )
 Isn 't he the punk who tried to sell a flatbed of hot mini- fridges to an undercover cop ? What 'd you get him ? Five months .
 Five months ?
 With his priors ?
 Well , he should be on his knees thanking you .
 I 'm trying to talk him out of going to trial . No !
 Seriously ?
 Seriously .
 ( SCOFFS ) You know what ?
 ( SlGHS ) No .
 No .
 We can fix this .
 I 'm from the D. A. ' s office , okay ?
 I 'm giving you what for .
 You 're giving me what for .
 We 'll be loud .
 We will go over there . We will make a scene , okay ?
 Uh ...
 New evidence has come to light , and I 'm pulling his deal with extreme prejudice .
 I ... I 'm pissed .
 I wanna put him away permanently .
 ( VlDEO GAME BEEPlNG ) ( SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY )
 JlMMY : ... third- degree felony ... ( SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY )
 But you fight me , I will push back hard .
 We 'll have that punk on his knees begging for the five months .
 ( SlGHS )


 I don 't think so .
 Yeah , come on , Kim .
 We can do this .
 Lead- pipe cinch . He 's the client .
 It 's his decision .
 What good is it gonna do to put that dweeb away in Los Lunas , huh ?
 You think he 's a jackass now ?
 Wait till he gets back from that clown college .
 Jimmy , it ...
 No .
 Yeah , but what about his wife and kid ? That 's them , right ? What about them ?
 If this isn 't using our powers for good , I don 't know what is . We 're not doing that . But , Kim , we can do it .
 It 'll work . I am not scamming my client .
 But it worked for Mesa Verde ...
 Jimmy , back off .
 Well , y ...
 ( CHUCKLlNG ) Okay .


 ( EXHALES SHARPLY )
 Um ... Yeah , I 'll see you at home .

 ( FOOTSTEPS DEPART )











 So , who was that ?

 Is everything all right ?
 ( SlGHS )

 He 's from the district attorney 's office .
 They 're taking the deal off the table .
 Uh , so what ?
 I mean , we weren 't gonna take it anyway , so ...
 Miss Wexler , why are they taking it off the table ?
 I ... don 't know for sure .
 It 's possible they have new evidence .
 Like ...
 Like ...
 Like ..
 Like what ?
 Like cameras or ... Or witnesses or ... I really couldn 't say .
 We 'll find out soon enough .
 Bobby , I 'm sorry .
 It looks like they want to make an example out of you .
 Uh ...
 All right , well , we better go tell the judge that we 're taking this to trial .
 Yeah , yeah , you know what ?
 Um ...
 Are you sure we still can 't get the five months ?


 The D. A. took that off the table .
 You mean if you ...
 Even if you asked real nice ?
 I could try .
 Are you sure that 's what you want ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I thought about it , just like you said , and ...
 I could do the five months .
 Miss Wexler , please ?
 ( SlGHS )

 Wait here .
 I can 't promise anything , but ...
 I 'll look into it .
 Sure , sure .
 You do that . We 'll ...
 We 'll be right here .
