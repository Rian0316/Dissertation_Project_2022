 Mike :
 Why me ?
 Because you understand .
 Understand what ?
 Revenge .
 I 'm not gonna let some low- life shyster bully me off my land .
 Kevin :
 No offense , Kim .
 That call center 's not movin ' one goddamn inch !
 There 's no reason to take this any further .
 It gets nasty .
 It gets personal .
 It gets dangerous .

 Where were you ? I 'm sorry , hon . I got held up down at the Clover .
 Guess I kind of lost track of time .
 You were drinking ? Kimmy . It was one beer .
 Doesn 't smell like one beer .
 Welp , that 's what it was .
 So let 's go . ¶ ¶ Get in . ¶ ¶
 Kim , I 'm not doin ' this . Come on .
 It 's cold out .
 Let 's -- Let 's go get some food , go home , split a box of McNuggets , see what 's on TV .
 I 'm just gonna walk .
 [ Sighs ] Really ? You 're gonna walk three miles with a cello .

 Don 't be stupid .
 I 'll -- I 'll let you choose the radio station .

 [ Button clicks ] Jimmy : So , can you do it ?
 The Media Lab has a- a vision mixer .
 I think we can get the effect that you 're goin ' for . And with makeup and costumes , we can make it look like the same time period .
 Jimmy : [ Chuckles ] That 's great .
 I love it .
 [ Laughs ]
 It 's gonna sing .
 I 'm sensing that Schleprock here is gonna puke on my parade .
 You want it when ? Uh , as soon as possible .
 Tomorrow would be optimal .
 Let me break it down for you , chief . You got 10 spots . I count 12 , 13 locations .
 Then there 's post , graphics , this video- effects thing you 're talking .
 That 's , uh , a week , maybe more .
 Probably more .
 We have midterms . And plus we have to lug all our stuff around .
 And actors , craft service ...
 You scout these locations ? Do I got a place to plug in ? Oh , and bathrooms .
 People need bathrooms .
 They literally need them all the time . Whoa , whoa . Just --
 There 's got to be a way , right ?
 'Cause we 're smart , so we can figure out a way , right ?
 Cut the number of spots . No . It 's --
 Shock and awe is what I 'm going for here .
 Anything less , no .
 Wh- What if you use voiceovers instead of actors ?
 Or if we did it all in one location ?
 So , no actors , no scope , no impact .
 No .
 Just ...
 I just feel like if we just get out there and this -- we hustle , we can do it .
 We can . Dude . Can 't be done .
 [ Sighs ]
 We -- Dude .
 We can 't .
 I mean , I don 't know .
 What if we did the Superman thing ?
 Uh , a -- a what ?
 You know , like Superman .
 Like , um -- Well , like a weatherman .
 Blue screen , I think .
 [ Laughs ]
 You mean a green screen ?
 Whatever .
 Blue , green .
 Just -- Can we do that ? [ Scoffs ] You got a green screen ?

 Everyone , a lot to do , no time to do it . Who knows their lines ? Yes , I believe I have it .
 Ah , I love a man of confidence .
 I played Prospero on the Plaza a month after prostate surgery .
 One has to have confidence . That 's wonderful . Uh -- God bless .
 Now bring that confidence right over here to this marker on the floor . That 's your spot .
 Do not move from it , okay ?
 Um , but also don 't be rigid , okay ?
 Try to be natural . And speak to me , you know , conversational , everyday , like a friend , but , uh -- [ Clears throat ]

 [ Sighs ]
 There 's fear here . There 's emotion .
 You 're searching for a hero .
 You know , will no one save you ? [ Chuckles ]
 But don 't hit it too hard .
 Just throw it away , but with feeling , okay ?
 Good . How we doin ' ? Shoot this mother .
 Alright .
 Oh , [ Clears throat ] there 's cue cards if you need 'em . But don 't look at them .
 Look at me , okay ? But , you know , they 're there .
 So , roll sound . Rolling . Camera .
 Man :
 Speeding .
 And ... action . [ Music stars ]
 This is great . Stand right there . You look great .
 Eyes open . Yeah , good , good .
 Can I drop your jaw ? Sideways a little .
 Perfect . That 's it . Press " record . "
 I can 't --
 And five , four , three , two ...
 Magic . ... magic . Delicious .
 You can 't have the pizza while we do the thing . Because we 're trying to shoot the commercial .
 That 's why . I 'm gonna keep it right here . Doing something with that thing ?
 Look up this way . Right ? And then stay right like that .
 Alright , show it to me . Just -- Really , okay ? ¶¶ Boom .
 You 're a cool guy , okay , but not too cool .
 I need you to be relatable . Give me that Fonz . Alright , good .
 Put it down . Nobody 's buying it . Okay , the cane , I think , is a little too much .
 Can I have it ?
 And five , four , three , two , magic .
 What ? ... need it .
 Let go .

 You look very , very officious , okay ?
 Alright , can you smile warmly ? No ?
 I 'm trying to direct .
 That 's good . Get out of the way . Okay .
 Get out of the way .
 And ... acting . Cool , alright ? Do that .
 Ready ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , like this . Too much , uh -- Put your hand right -- Yeah , yeah . ¶¶
 Stand on the X. This is great . Smile .
 [ Crunches food ]
 Turn sideways . Take your Coke out of her hand .
 And now look sad , glum . Mnh .
 And then when I say " action , " you look here .
 No .
 Faster .
 Make it a whip -- Whip your head .
 Up here , and then -- go ! -- action .
 Like this . ¶¶ Look back . Okay .
 Anyone else ?
 So that they don 't reflect , okay ? That looks normal .
 Look right in .
 Look at me .
 Point .
 Make it look real . ¶¶
 No .
 More , more . ¶¶
 Good .
 And ... cut !

 I 'm good .
 You sure ?
 'Cause it 's , um , cold pizza fondled by community theater actors . You gonna pass on that . [ Chuckles ]
 Yeah , I think I will pass . I just -- I just wanted to talk .
 Talk ? Yeah , sure .
 Of course . Uh , five . [ Clears throat ]
 Good news -- I tracked down Olivia Bitsui .
 She is 92 years young .
 She 's part of the Navajo Nation . She lives out by Window Rock .
 I 'm gonna call her first thing in the morning , hopefully have a face- to- face . Jimmy --
 Think I 'm gonna bring a floral arrangement or maybe a cake assortment from Brother 's Bakery .
 Good idea .
 Jimmy , d- do you think ... Will Acker settle for $75, 000 ? $75, 000 ?

 Yeah . Will he go for it ?
 Are you saying that Kevin is willing to go up to $75, 000 on this ?
 I -- [ Stammers ]
 Look , we 'll negotiate as far up as we can , and then I 'll make up the difference .
 Wait . Hold on .
 Y- You 'll make up the difference as in " out of your own pocket " make up the difference ?
 I -- Yes .
 I just need to end this now and move on .
 But why ? No , hey , we have him .
 Rich is suspicious .
 He said some things .
 He 's second- guessing how you got to be Acker 's lawyer and questioning my intentions , enough to want me off the case . We move forward with this ,
 Rich is gonna figure out what 's happening .
 Here 's the truth .
 Rich knows nothing . Well , not yet , no .
 Not ever .
 He has nothing . There 's no way to prove anything .
 [ Sighs ]
 You may be right .
 But it 's just not worth it .
 But ... what about the play here ? The play is beautiful .
 [ Sighs ]
 God , this is like watching a walk- off home run just drift foul .
 Ugh . [ Inhales sharply ] It 's your play .
 If you want to walk , we 'll walk .

 So , I got to -- I got to break it to the kids .
 [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ]
 Well , there 's a lot to clean up before Mrs. Ngyuen can open in the morning , so ...
 I 'll help .
 No .
 You 've been all day at work .
 Jimmy , you 're out here doing all this because of me .
 I 'm helping .

 I don 't know what to tell you .
 I warned you . What ?
 I warned you when you started going after Hector Salamanca there 'd be others to worry about . You made a choice .
 You got in with both eyes open .
 My father didn 't .
 He 's got a gun to my father 's head .

 I don 't do what he says ...

 Fantastic . Kevin will be over the moon .
 When is it official ? There 's a meeting on the books with Mr. Goodman for Wednesday at 3 : 00 .
 Paige : Music to my ears .
 Kevin 's gonna wanna be there to close this out and celebrate .
 I can 't wait . Congrats , Paige . Paige :
 Congrats to you guys . Kim , this was another tough one , but you did it again .
 A team effort .
 We 'll e- mail you the details . Great . Talk soon .
 [ Receiver clatters ]
 Okay . [ Chuckles ] Well , now that that 's behind us and I have you here ,
 I want to talk to Jason in Charlotte , walk us through these Fannie and Freddie changes .
 Dorothy , can you set up that North Carolina call ?
 Actually , before we do that , c -- Sorry . Marcie , would you give us a minute ? Oh .
 Sure , absolutely .
 Dorothy , hold off on that call , please .
 Thanks .
 [ Door opens ] I , uh ... [ Door closes ]
 [ Sighs ]
 I wanted to talk about yesterday .
 Rich , you 've been nothing but generous to me .
 And you don 't deserve to be yelled at .
 It was unprofessional .
 I believe me staying on the case was the right thing , but that was the wrong way to react .
 [ Chuckles ]
 That 's it .
 Just that I 'm sorry .
 Hmm .
 Kim ... you have a bone to pick with me , pick away .
 In fact , you want to lose your shit , that 's alright , too . I 'm not perfect . I 've broken plenty of times .
 But never in front of the troops .
 I don 't have to spell out what it does for morale , confidence .
 Never again .
 Hi .
 Yeah , no , let 's punt the call to Charlotte to another time .
 Also , cancel my 12 : 30 , but keep the reservation .
 Yeah , that 's right .

 Hi . Excuse me .
 Are these really only a quarter each ?
 That 's right .
 Why so cheap ?
 Is there some kind of damage I 'm not seeing ? No .
 We get lots of donations , books we already have , and there 's just not enough room on the shelves , so we sell what we can to pay for newer releases .

 That 's $2 .
 Yes , ma 'am .

 Thank you .
 Do you need a bag ? No . I 'm fine .
 Thank you .
 May I ask -- is there a Lillian Simmons working here ?
 Yes .
 I 'm Lily . Lily . Great .
 My name 's Dave Clark .
 I 'm a private investigator . Oh . Is this about Travel Wire ?
 That 's right .
 I already told the police everything I saw , which wasn 't much .
 You saw a man with a mustache , dark hair , kind of tall .
 I 'm not even sure anymore . It was through two sets of glass , and he was leaning over a desk .
 Uh- huh . Are you free to sit and talk somewhere , see if you remember any other details ?
 As I said , I told the police everything I could remember .
 Oh , I know .
 And the police are doing their best with that information .
 But I 've been hired by the family .
 And I am trying to help them find ...
 [ Chuckles ]
 They 're looking for closure , Lily . Anything to bring them peace .
 I send money back to my parents back in Taiwan .
 I- I do it every month . Fred was always there .
 We didn 't really talk much , but he was efficient .
 So , you see that man inside on the day in question .
 That 's right . The door sign was flipped " closed , " which it never was .
 And then the man pointed at the sign and waved me off .
 I don 't know . I thought they were having Internet problems or something .
 I came back 20 minutes later .
 Oh , it was horrible . Thick black smoke and flames .
 And the man with the mustache -- you didn 't seem him when you returned .
 No . I got there just as the fire engines were arriving .
 Well , let 's talk about when you first got there . You drove , I assume . Yes .
 Where 'd you park ?
 Right out front , just to the right of the entrance .
 Where there any other cars parked there ?
 Um , a few .
 The normal amount .
 Mm- hmm . Any unusual or unique cars ?
 Unusual ?
 Older cars , classic cars , something you might not see every day .
 Actually , I think there was .
 You remember what kind ?
 Oh , I don 't really know cars .
 It had four wheels .
 [ Both laugh ]
 Okay .
 That look familiar ?
 Is this the car ?
 Um ... that 's not for me to say .




 Um ... yes , now that I look at it , yes , that was the type of car it was .
 Uh- huh . A customized 1970 Monte Carlo ?
 Okay . [ Chuckles ] And that is a huge help , Lily .
 Thank you very much . Oh , good .
 Anything for that poor family . Uh , there is something else . Yes ?
 Uh , if you were able to call the detectives who interviewed you and pass this along firsthand , tell them that you remember that detail ?
 That was so long ago . I don 't think I can remember who I spoke to .
 Well , I have that right here .
 Detective Tim Roberts .
 That 's his number . Probably catch him at his desk right now .
 Oh , okay .
 A gray 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo .
 Gray ?
 Mm- hmm .
 And if you don 't mind , don 't mention my name .
 Police get a little funny about private investigators horning in on their business .
 They can have all the credit .
 I only want justice .
 Oh , absolutely .
 I understand . [ Dialing ]
 Thank you , Lillian .

 Count your lucky stars we got Judge Papadoumian . She likes my flair .
 Baby , you went the extra mile for us today .
 Don 't think I didn 't notice .
 Hey , you want a quick rub- n- tug ? Just to say " thanks " ? Uh ...
 We won 't mess up your suit or nothin ' .
 We 'll clean you up nice with a warm towel . A warm towel . I appreciate the offer , but I 'm gonna --
 I 'm gonna politely decline , if that 's okay . Rain check .
 Well , we gotta get back to it anyway .
 Almost lunchtime .
 Oh .
 Oh , um ... hey , do you two think that maybe -- maybe you should take a break ?
 You don 't see restaurants closin ' doors at noon , do ya ?
 Lunch is peak traffic .
 Just be careful , alright ? And try not to get picked up again , okay ?

 Really ?

 Uh , today .
 Today .
 And where 's it supposed to be today ?
 Uh , Detective Roberts . And don 't you think that Detective Roberts should get it sometime today ?
 Uh , yes , absolutely .
 Sorry , sir .
 Hmm .
 If the smell is coming from under your porch , it is most likely a possum .
 That 's right , a possum .
 If it 's a human body , yes , I 'll investigate .
 But you need to call animal control first . Yes , I 'm sure .
 [ Indistinct conversations ]
 You can also shine a flashlight under the porch and see what 's under there yourself .
 Well ... if the porch isn 't big enough for you to get under , then there 's probably not a dead body , okay ?

 What are the odds ? Who sent this ? Officer McFloss ?
 I can 't even read that .

 Hello , folks .
 [ Door closes ]
 Nice to see lots and lots of happy faces .
 And you , too , Rich . Kiddin ' . Jimmy .
 Always a pleasure . Saul . Saul Goodman during business hours ,
 " s 'all " the time .
 This is Paige Novick , Mesa Verde 's in- house counsel .
 Very nice to meet you . Paige .
 I know you 're the one who brought Kim Wexler onto the team , so I consider you the brains of the operation .
 I actually think you 're right about that .
 And this is Kevin Wachtell , CEO of Mesa Verde . Oh . You know what ?
 I could tell from the impressive belt buckle . Really looking forward to settling this .
 Me too . Let 's do this .
 [ Inhales sharply , clears throat ] Hey , Viola .
 How 's it hangin ' ? I , uh ... Good ?
 Jimmy :
 Cool .
 Kim :
 Just to jump into it -- Jump away . [ Clears throat ]
 [ Chuckles ]
 As discussed , considering we 're only contractually obligated to pay $5, 000 on top of fair market value for Mr. Acker 's home , we believe $45, 000 is more than generous .
 I hear that , but , um , you and I have a different definition of the word " generous . "
 Because that 's not how I would describe it .
 And here we go .
 We 're not prepared to offer more than what 's on the table .
 No , no , I- I knew there would be dickering , so let 's -- let 's just hear the number you 're looking for so we can all move forward with our lives .
 We 'd like nothing more . What amount are you asking ? $4 million .
 Rich : [ Laughs ] $4 million .
 Very funny . Very funny .
 Mr. Acker would like to be paid $4 million for his pain and suffering .
 It 's what 's fair . What in the world are you talking about ? Jimmy :
 It 's a four with six zeroes , and it 's preceded by a dollar sign .
 We had an agreement .
 We had a discussion .
 We had a verbal agreement on a number that both sides would be happy with .
 And I discussed the offer with my client , and he really , really doesn 't want to leave his house , his home . $4 million is the only number he 'll be happy with .
 [ Sighs ]
 I apologize .
 We need to end this meeting now so Rich and I can have a conversation with Mr ... Goodman .
 Just ... incredible nerve . [ Door opens ] Ridiculous .
 What 's your endgame here ?
 Because you know you 're never gonna get that money . Wait . Wait .
 Don 't leave .
 You 're not wasting any more of their time . [ Clears throat ] Jimmy :
 No , I --
 Kevin , meeting 's over .
 Not while the gang 's all here .
 I would love to bring up a completely unrelated matter .
 Kevin , we can handle this . No . This is really good .
 You 're gonna want to see this .
 Kevin , you wanna stick around .
 Your dad 's in this . What ? Kevin , I insist .
 This is a waste of your time . There 's only one way to find out .
 Kevin , I 'm advising you to please just keep walking .

 Are you kidding me ? Paige : None of that is true .
 Rich : You can 't air this . It 's libel .
 It 's defamation !
 It 's libel , and we will sue you . That 's my father you 're making a fool of .
 Kim : Jimmy , turn it off .
 You know you can 't do this . Shh . This is a good one .



 Don :


 There 's no way in hell you can legally run these .
 Mm . Maybe .
 But , you know , we 'll fight it out after they run in New Mexico , Arizona , Utah , Tex --
 No , no , no , we will stop it before it ever gets that far .
 Some might call that prior restraint .
 You know what ? You can stop us . Some news outlet will pick it up .
 They 'll run for free .


 My dad never , ever did anything like that .
 None of this is true . This is all fantasy . It doesn 't matter .
 This trash airs , our reputation is in the toilet .
 It 'll never , ever get that far .
 Shh . Jimmy :




 Kevin : Stop .
 Stop it !

 I 've seen enough of this horseshit .
 Jesus . There 's lots more .
 You know what ? I can leave you this one because I 've got plenty of copies . Paige :
 What do you hope to gain with all this ?
 We agree to Acker 's ridiculous demands and you don 't run this garbage ?
 It 's illegal to do that .
 No lawyer can play one case off another . It is unethical , and it is blackmail .
 She 's right .
 One has absolutely nothing to do with the other , which leads me to my next topic .
 This is Olivia Bitsui . She 's a photographer . In fact , she took this self- portrait .
 It 's really lovely . Here 's another picture she took 54 years ago . Kevin , say nothing .
 Kevin :
 No , Kim , I got this -- Kevin , I 'm strongly advising you -- I know this picture . Kevin !
 My dad bought it fair and square .
 I have a copy of it hanging in my office at home .
 I think we all just heard Mr. Wachtell admit that he owns a copy of Olivia Bitsui 's photo , a photo that looks remarkably like the official Mesa Verde logo .
 That 's right . We own it ! You own a copy of the photo .
 You don 't own the rights to it . That 's copyright infringement .
 You 'll never be able to prove that . Well , you know what ?
 [ Exhales sharply ] Wow .
 Looks like a mirror image there .
 So I think I can convince a judge and probably a jury that Mesa Verde misappropriated
 Ms. Bitsui 's intellectual property .
 It 's not your fault .
 Sins of the father .
 But , um , we filed an injunction , so you 're gonna have to take down all your horsey logos or throw a big tarp over 'em till we can get this thing settled .
 Shouldn 't take more than --
 I don 't know -- a couple years ?
 We 'll be seein ' a lot of each other . Till next time .
 [ Whistling ]
 [ Indistinct conversations ]

 Yeah , the problem we 're facing is that none of the so- called victims said , " Mesa Verde did this , " or , " Mesa Verde did that . "
 No . Everybody said " my bank . " They never used the words " Mesa Verde . "
 Exactly .
 But it 's in front of our images , our logo . Yes , Paige , it 's all heavily inferred , but it 's done in a way to keep us wrangling in the courts .
 We 'll be there forever , going 'round and 'round . So , how do we keep them off the air ?
 We 're -- [ Sighs ]
 We 're gonna have to get ahead of him .
 How ?
 We notify the stations that -- that -- that they 're susceptible to a libel suit if they air .
 Rich :
 It might an extended game of whack- a- mole . Rich , any way you slice this , it 's a long- haul battle .
 We have to take things one at a time .
 Meanwhile , we have to counter the copyright injunction . Paige :
 I mean , do we need to discuss libel ?
 We can start with that . That 's straightforward . Do we need to discuss terrorism ?
 [ Overlapping arguing ]
 Kim :
 Kevin . Rich : Kevin !
 Kevin , Kevin , I know you 're upset , but please don 't do anything rash .
 Let your lawyers take care of it .
 We 'll fix this .
 Kim , can I just go to the men 's room ?
 Of course . Yeah .
 Okay , now , with the copyright infringement , I think we ...

 Where are you ?
 Man : ... pretty well ironed out ... Stay there .
 [ Horn honking ]
 [ Metal screeching ]
 [ Sighs ] What 'll it take ?
 Oh , you 're gonna have to be more specific .
 I let Acker stay in his shitty little house and I move my call center and all the rest of it goes away ?
 Is that the game ? Ahp . As your counselor , Ms. Wexler informed you
 I 'm not allowed to do that .
 Gimme a break . You 're a third- rate huckster who 'd sell your own mother 's organs to get what you want .
 What will it take ?
 Mind you , again , I 'm not actually allowed to do any of this , not intentionally .
 Cut to the chase , jackass .
 Well , Kevin , would you -- would you close your eyes and imagine a world with me ? Just if you ...
 It 's a world where Mr. Acker gets to keep his house , plus the $45, 000 you were gonna pay him for his pain and suffering .
 And in this world , you throw in a public apology .
 And imagine a world where a Native American photographer -- Olive Bitsui -- is compensated $200, 000 for the use of her photo , in addition to receiving future credit for the inspiration and use of the logo from Mesa Verde .
 Also -- you know what ? -- throw in a public apology for Ms. Bitsui while you 're at it .
 And then -- then I can imagine a world where the injunction disappears .
 And those commercials -- oh , they 'll never see the light of day .
 And , poof , away they go into a vault , never to be seen by mortal eyes again .
 What do you think of that world , huh , Kevin ? ! You can open your eyes now .
 Can you imagine a world where we shake hands on that , man to man ?

 Yeah , he just dropped me off .

 How 'd it go ?

 That was pretty perfect , right ?
 [ Sighs ]


 Kim , uh ...
 [ Inhales sharply ] Kim .
 Look , apologies , alright ?
 I 'm -- I 'm sorry for sandbagging you with the ol ' switcheroo .
 I- I should have warned you . But you know what ? You being angry at me -- that worked .
 You were concerned that Rich was suspicious .
 Did he say anything ?
 No .
 Great .
 See ?
 That anger , real anger -- it worked like a protective immunity shield , you know ?
 I mean , hey , emotion like that -- you can 't fake it . No . You can 't .
 Yeah , right ? So , what 'd Kevin say ?
 Uh ... he said he was tired of lawyers .
 Wait . Wait . Do the voice .
 You got to do the voice .
 Kevin is sick of lawyers , wants to be done with all of it .
 We explained that your agreement is non- binding , but he doesn 't care .
 He 's sticking with the handshake . Boom ! There ya go .
 That 's a plan cooked and served to juicy perfection .
 We -- We should celebrate .
 Really .
 We 'll go to a steakhouse , get a couple bottles of red wine , some Tiramisu , the whole nine yards .
 [ Sighs ]
 Okay , Kim , look , I said I was sorry . And , again , it worked .
 No way that Rich or Paige could believe that we were in cahoots
 ' cause -- guess what -- we weren 't . [ Clears throat ]
 Acker gets to keep his home , plus a nice chunk of change .
 Olivia Bitsui gets reparations for being cheated .
 And Kevin still gets his call center . Everybody wins . You win , Jimmy .
 What ?
 You win . Uh , yeah .
 But , I mean , well , we win .
 Us . No . I didn 't .
 What didn 't you get that you wanted ?
 I don 't trust you .
 Why ?
 You played me .
 You made me the sucker ... again . Again ?
 What -- Wait . How can you be the sucker ?
 It was your plan .
 Oh , fuck you , Jimmy . God .
 I -- Uh , you know what ? I can 't do this anymore .
 Kim , I was just --
 No , you -- you turned you and me versus the bank into you versus me .
 And it is not just this . It 's the same thing over and over again .
 No , I kept things from you to protect you .
 Look , if I got caught and -- God forbid -- you 're questioned under oath , you have plausible deniability .
 Jesus , Jimmy . You can excuse stabbing me in the back by making it about protecting me ?
 Is that -- Is that really supposed to justify everything ?
 Okay , Kim , I 'm sorry .
 [ Scoffs ] I 'm sorry , alright ?
 It -- It will never happen again . That 's a lie .
 Well , I swear . I swear it won 't .
 Look me in the eye and tell me it 'll never happen again .
 [ Breathing sharply ]
 You can 't .
 I don 't believe you .
 You don 't believe yourself .
 It is a lie . You lie . I lie .
 This has to end .
 I- I- I cannot keep living like this .
 No , no . No , no , Kim , we can fix this . Jimmy , no , shut up .
 Jimmy , Jimmy , you know this has to change .
 If you don 't see it , I don 't know what to say because we are at a breaking point .
 Oh , God !
 Either we end this now --
 No !
 Either we end this now and [ Voice breaking ] enjoy the time we had and go our separate ways , or we 're ...
 [ Exhales sharply ]
 Or what ?
 Or we 're -- we 're -- I mean ...
 [ Inhales deeply ]
 Or maybe ...
 Maybe we get married .
