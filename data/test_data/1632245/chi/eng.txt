 How does an archeology professor get that good with a whip ?
 Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore .
 That 's how I learned .
 I can 't believe you 've never seen
 And I can 't believe you 've never read

 When she comes out with I 'll read it .
 I don 't care if changed your life , I 'm not reading it .
 You know , I could totally rock a hat like that .
 That 's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman .
 She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson 's video , which I 've never viewed in its entirety , as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible .
 And also , it 's really scary .
 Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track ?
 There 's no switch . Just listen and learn .
 Penny , if you think this is good , you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial .
 Well , I 'm watching it now . Why would I want to see it again on Friday ?
 Because the print they 're showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage .
 21 seconds ? That 'll be like seeing a whole new movie !
 Exactly . They say it finally solves the submarine controversy .
 Did -- Leonard ?
 I 'm no expert , but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm .
 Oh ! Good .
 I 'm eight for 26 this month .
 Yeah , I think I 'll pass . But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds .
 Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing , we 'd still be together .
 Mm , yeah , no , we wouldn 't .
 Uh- huh . I 'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that , too .

 Original Air Date on November 11 , 2010 May I point out to you all that the screening is " first come , first served " ?
 Relax , it 's 5 : 00 . The movie doesn 't start till midnight .
 Another way of saying that is
 " the movie starts at midnight , and it 's already 5 : 00 . "
 Let 's go . You know , if we miss it , we 'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives .
 See ?
 Howard 's on my side .
 Actually , I 'm not . I 'm using sarcasm to mock you .
 Drat . Now I 'm 8 for 27 .
 Don 't worry , Sheldon .
 We 'll be fine . What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of

 Oh .
 Well , he waited in line for 14 hours , while you napped in a lawn chair , he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn 't wake up to vouch for him , and worst of all , he saw

 But how were our seats ?
 Excellent . I rest my case .
 Amy , don 't you agree we should leave now and get in line ?
 Actually , as the newest member of your social group ,
 I believe I 'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time .
 Shrewd .
 Leonard , you 're right .
 We should enjoy our meal , arrive late , and risk winding up with terrible seats , assuming we get in at all .
 Thank you , Amy .
 See ? It 's working .
 Knock- knock .
 Who 's there ? Olive .
 Olive you , too . Guys , that 's really starting to get old .
 Knock- knock .
 Who 's there ? I have a girlfriend and you don 't .
 Hysterical !
 Wait , now , we don 't know that yet . He isn 't finished . I have a girlfriend and you don 't
 So . Are you sure you don 't want to come with us to
 Oh , no . That movie has melting faces .
 It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh- eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab .
 Besides , Penny and I are having a girls ' night tonight .
 Girls ' night ? What does that entail ?
 Oh , you know , girls get together , hang out , share girl talk .
 I 'm a girl .
 Oh .
 Well , maybe you can join us . I 'll ask Penny .
 No need . Penny and I are very close .
 You are ?
 Yes . In fact , our menses are synchronized .
 Penny . Bernadette tells me you 're planning a girls ' night .
 Yeah ? I 'm a girl .
 Oh . Um , it was -- it was just going to be me and Bernadette .
 Besides , I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys .
 Yes , but they 're not girls . I 'm a girl .
 Yeah , no , no , I- I- I got that .
 What 's the dress code ? Uh , just wear something comfortable .
 All right . I 'll have to go shopping .
 Knock- knock .
 Who is there ? Hugh .
 Hugh who ? Hugh people need to listen to me .

 It 's time to get in line for the movie .
 And that 's how you tell a knock- knock joke .
 Under normal circumstances I 'd say , " I told you so . "
 But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already , the phrase has lost all meaning .
 Therefore , I will be replacing it with the phrase :
 " I informed you thusly . "
 Ooh . Can 't wait for that to start .
 I informed you thusly .
 Eight for 28 .
 This is where we could have been if we hadn 't stopped for dinner .
 This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn 't ordered dessert .
 Well I earned it , dude , I ate all my broccoli .
 And here 's where we are .
 The runts in a large litter . unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones .
 So I guess it 's a good thing we stopped for dinner .
 You know , guys , when facing disappointment ,
 teaches us --
 Oh , shut up .
 ... so anyway , to make a long story short , turns out I have an unusually firm cervix .
 You -- Amy , when we say " girl talk , " it doesn 't just have to be about our lady parts .
 Shame . 'Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus .
 Penny , your nails look great .
 Oh , thanks . I found this place in Alhambra .
 It 's in a woman 's basement .
 I think it 's a front for human trafficking , but they do a really good job .
 A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements .
 Well don 't tell me that 's not " girl talk . "
 So where should we go tonight ?
 A bar ? A club ?
 A movie ?
 Or we could just stay here . Yes , and continue to bond .
 I have a feeling that after tonight , one of you will become my best friend forever .
 Or " BFF , " if you prefer .
 Which I don 't .
 All right , time to open Bachelor Number Two .
 Gee , I don 't know if I should drink more .
 I have to drive home , and I 've got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is .
 That 's okay . You can just sleep here .
 Oh , good , a slumber party !
 We 'll do makeovers , initiate phony phone calls , and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties !
 Oh , gosh , Amy . I don 't know if I would call this an actual slumber party .
 Well , that 's disappointing . I 've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party .
 Oh , you never were ? Not even when you were a kid ?
 Well , there was the time I had my tonsils out , and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl .
 She didn 't make it through the night , but up till then , it was kind of fun .
 Okay . Well , I guess we 're having a slumber party .
 Oh !
 Pillow fight !
 Oh , I hope they let us in soon .
 I 'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom .
 The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time .
 It 's a vicious circle .
 Too bad you don 't have a stadium pal like me .
 What 's a stadium pal ?
 Let me put it this way : takes care of the bathroom problem , and it keeps your calf warm .
 Hey , guys , bad news . I just did a quick calculation .
 Given the size of the theater and the length of this line , we might not get seats .
 What did he say ?
 Nice going , Raj . Just got him down for his nap .
 We might not get seats ? !
 It 's fine , it 's fine . Go back to sleep . Oh , I informed you thusly !
 I so informed you thusly . Howard , you talk to him .
 Howard ?
 You 're peeing , aren 't you ?
 Hey , look who 's here !
 Hey , buddies !
 Well , if it isn 't Wil Wheaton , the Jar Jar Binks of the universe .
 Mee- sa think that very funny !
 Well , you- sa can go think that at the back of the line .
 No cuts , no buts , no coconuts .
 Wil Wheaton .
 Yeah . I 'm a big fan . Of what ?
 Poorly executed beards ? Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie ?
 We got here a little late .
 No problem . Come on , I 'll hook you up . Awesome .
 We- sa gonna go into the movie now ! Bye- bye !
 This is Jones , not
 There should be no value to his pseudo- celebrity here !
 And even at Star Trek conventions , they only let him in if he helps set up !
 Calm down , Sheldon .
 I will not calm down . This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered .
 As Captain Jean- Luc Picard once said ,
 " The line must be drawn here !
 " This far , no farther ! "
 Had to wake him up from his nap , didn 't you ?
 You know what I really love about Howard ?
 His chest hair .
 Howard has a hairy chest ? No , just the one .
 But it 's really long .
 Okay , there you go -- Sultry Sunrise Red .
 What do you think ? My nails have never looked so pretty before .
 Get it off .
 Oh , oh , uh , looks like they 're getting ready to let people in .
 Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting .
 " Best seats in house for screening .
 Suck on that , Sheldon Cooper . "
 Why do you read his Twitter feed ? You know it 's only going to upset you .
 I believe in knowing my enemy , Leonard .
 Had Twitter existed at the time , would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull ?
 Would not Lee have followed Grant ?
 Would not Spy have followed Spy ?
 I have more examples , but excuse me .
 Hello .
 Well , this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality , but go on .
 Test phrases ? All right .
 Imatote .
 Ulba .
 Twad .
 All together ?
 I 'm a total buttwad .
 Why are you laughing ?
 Hello ?
 And that , girls , is how you make a phony phone call .
 I 'm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value , but all right .
 Next on Wikipedia 's list of slumber party activities :
 " Truth or Dare . " Okay , it 's your game .
 You go first . Hang on . I 'm familiarizing myself with the rules .
 Seems fairly straightforward .
 Bernadette , truth or dare ?
 Truth . All right .
 To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy ?
 Um ... Remember , you have to answer honestly .
 Wait . No , Amy , you 're supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing .
 Oh .
 All right . What is the circumference of your areolas ?
 " Munching on complimentary popcorn .
 Woot , woot . " Oh , the gall .
 I hope his next tweet is " Popcorn lodged in trachea .
 " Choking to death .
 Woot , woot . "
 Guys , I am sorry .
 We are full up . No !
 We 're full up . We really want to see this .
 Isn 't there anything you can do ? Sorry . Fire regulations .
 Should 've gotten here earlier . This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary .
 Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don 't .
 ' Cause I 'm the petty functionary with a clipboard , bitch .
 I guess that 's that .
 Let 's go home .
 You know what ? I 'm going back to " I told you so . "
 I told you so .
 We can still see something .
 Oh , the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away .
 You know Sandy B. always brings it .
 Look -- a side door .
 Come on , Short Round .
 I guess we 'd better go after him .
 Short Round ? Indy 's young sidekick from
 Yeah , I know who it is , but why is it me ?
 You 're right .
 It should be a cuddly Asian boy . Like me .
 " And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye ,
 " and Nicholas is scalded in the towte .
 This tale is doon , and God save al the rowte . "
 What the hell was that ?
 Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story .
 " The Miller 's Tale " by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know .
 It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks .
 I thought it was pretty spicy . Especially the part where he kisses her nether ye .
 You might not like it as much if you knew what " nether ye " meant . if one cares about hygiene , one ought not be kissing it .
 Okay , my turn .
 Penny , truth or dare ? Truth .
 Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him ?
 Oh , that 's an excellent question .
 For two people who claim to be no longer pair- bonded , you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other 's company .
 Yeah .
 Dare .
 I don 't believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change .
 Yeah .
 Okay , look , just because we 're not seeing each other anymore doesn 't mean we can 't be friends .
 I mean , Leonard 's a great guy .
 Then , why did you terminate your relationship with him ?
 I don 't know . He got really serious , and I wasn 't ready for it .
 Interesting .
 How will you react if , in the future , you become ready for it , and Leonard is unavailable , because another woman has realized that he is -- to use your words -- " a great guy " ?
 You can only ask one question .
 That one .
 You know what , I don 't want to play anymore .
 Well , I 'm not sure how this is scored , but I believe we may have won .
 Sheldon ?
 Sheldon ?
 Where did he go ?
 We 're looking for Sheldon , not Marmaduke .
 You whistled ?
 What is that ? with 21 additional seconds .
 If I can 't see it , no one else can see it .
 Sheldon , this is crazy . No . Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended .
 Listen to me . You are over- tired .
 You 're not thinking right . Put the movie back before we get into trouble .
 Trouble is my middle name , Leonard .
 Actually , it 's Lee , but I prefer Trouble .
 Oh , look who they let in .
 Don 't worry , Wil Wheaton . I was just leaving .
 Come on , Short Round .
 Yeah .
 Come on , guys ! Hurry up !
 Hurry up ! Let 's see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg .
 He 's got the movie ! Get him !
 Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one ?
 She 's been in there a long time .
 Clearly , losing Truth or Dare upset her .
 Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity .
 Ooh , like what ?
 Well , the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism .
 Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking ?
 Penny ?
 Oh , hey , Amy .
 Look , I 'm sorry I got so upset .
 I just ...
 Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 What are you doing ? Don 't worry .
 I 'll avoid the nether ye .
 I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough .
