 My electronic monitoring device .
 I 'm on house arrest . It 's a condition on my bail .

 I need you to check into someone else 's background .
 There is this plumber I know .
 Bree , you are not going to regret taking this journey with me !
 Peterson called me into his office today .
 He 's going to hold that promotion for Duggan .
 He changed his mind .
 I 'm pregnant , and it might be yours .





 Miss Britt , you look extra beautiful today .
 Oh Cyrus , you 're so sweet .
 So anyhow , I -- I was wondering if -- maybe --
 I could -- take you out to dinner sometime ?
 Oh honey .
 You are so far out of your league that you 're playing a completely different sport .
 Hey there .
 Hi Edie , what 's up ?
 Nice ensemble .
 You busy ? I bought a bunch of fresh donuts from my construction workers , and as you can see , bought a few too many . No , not really .
 Oh , good .


 So I thought maybe you and I could --
 Susan !
 Hey there , Edie .
 Wha -- what are you -- ?
 Mike and I are back together .
 Uh . Super !
 I knew you 'd be happy for us . So what 's going on ?
 Uh , Edie was just about to --
 Free donuts ! Want 'em or not ?
 Sweet , thanks !
 Why don 't you go put these on a plate ? Oh , and save me one with sprinkles !

 I cannot believe you are still coming on to him .
 You said you two were finished .
 You thought he was a murderer .
 And was your cue to come over and flirt ?
 You wasted your time . And your donuts .
 Not if you choke on them .
 Thanks Edie , the donuts were great .
 A pleasure .
 See ya .
 I 'll run home and get some milk to go with those donuts .
 Hey .
 It 's a shame you gotta keep running back and forth .
 Well , I can 't have donuts and juice . It 's unnatural .
 No .
 I mean , we should move in together .
 C 'mon , what do you say ?
 Uh , um -- I say , um , oh !
 Hold that thought !
 Edie , Edie ! Stop !

 What now ?
 I was just rude back there , gloating and everything , and I apologize .
 Thank you , Susan . Very big of you .
 And on a completely unrelated topic , Mike and I are moving in together .
 See ya !

 Hey Cyrus !
 You have lunch plans ?
 No .

 Elsborough hotel .
 Half an hour . Welcome to the majors !







 Hey .
 I thought you might be thirsty .
 No , I 'm good .
 So how 's your roommate doing ?
 He 's hanging in there .
 Yeah , well -- I had to tell him some news that was a little bit upsetting for him .
 No kidding .
 Excuse me ?
 What do you get off telling John he 's not good enough to raise a child ?
 That kid could be his ! It is a complicated situation .
 Seems pretty simple to me .
 You 're an unfeeling bitch .
 Why did you hit the lawn boy ?
 Well , if you saw what he did to our begonias , you 'd slap him too .
 I can 't tell from -- from this .
 I can 't tell anything with any --
 Hey !
 Hey Lynette , what are you doing here ? What 's this ?
 You told me Duggan 's coming back to work today .
 I thought I 'd do something special for him .
 Aha . And this won 't have anything to do with you checking up on me and Annabelle ?
 What ? Yesterday , you brought pictures of the kids .
 The day before that , you brought me soup .
 Lynette , honey -- it 's gotta stop .
 Tom .
 I don 't care about you working with Annabelle . I told you that .
 This is for Duggan . He had a heart attack .
 I don 't care about Annabelle .
 Hey , Lynette !
 Ah ! Speak of the devil !
 And I mean that .
 Well . You 're becoming a regular fixture around here , aren 't ya ?
 Oh , yeah , I wanted to do something nice for Duggan .
 I suppose filling his bloodstream with butter fat might be considered nice .
 Actually , it 's fruit- juice sweetened .
 Can I cut you ? ... a piece ?
 Everyone , I need to see you right now .
 OK , listen up .
 I just spoke with Tim Duggan 's wife , and it looks like he 's not going to be returning to work after all .
 Seems that he had a relapse last night , which unfortunately puts us in a very tight spot .
 We 'll work together as a team and do what we need to do .
 So Jerry , you 're taking the Hollister account .
 Susanne , you 're covering Faraday Springs , and Annabelle , I want you to take the lead on the Travellers ' Hotel chain .
 You 're leaving for Hawaii in three days .
 I can 't handle Travellers ' by myself .
 Especially not if they 're moving into print .
 Well , choose someone to take with you .
 Oh , OK , um --
 I choose --
 Tom !
 Let 's see .
 I 've beaten you at Bridge and Mah- jongg and Hearts .
 This is your last chance to redeem yourself this time .
 Stop it , you 're going to make me laugh .
 OK . OK , I 'll be good !
 Miss it ! Miss it ! Miss it !
 Bree -- - Come on , I want to psyche you out !
 OK , time 's up , take your best shot !
 I 'm not ready yet .
 Hurry up , there are people waiting .
 - One more minute .
 Come on , take your best --
 Don 't do that !
 George -- Do you have an erection ?
 I 'm sorry .
 What on earth -- - You were blowing on my ear !
 I was teasing you !
 - Exactly ! You have got to get rid of it . There are children present !
 How ?
 I don 't know , um -- Think of something unpleasant !
 Like what ? Like famine or disease or -- hobos !
 Whatever , just hurry !
 You can 't be mad about it !
 It 's not something men can control !
 I kept this friendship going because I thought Rex 's dislike of you was paranoid , but you had feelings for me all along !
 God , this is such a betrayal !
 Come on , Bree !
 The only thing I am guilty of is loving you in silence .
 Well , you shouldn 't be doing that .
 In case you 've forgotten , I 'm married .
 To a selfish two- faced liar who betrayed you with a hooker !
 I told you that in confidence .
 How dare you throw it back in my face ?
 So -- you 're ending our friendship ?
 After everything I 've done for you ?
 What is that supposed to mean ?
 Nothing .
 It didn 't mean anything .
 George , I do love you -- as a friend .
 I wish you could love me the same way back , but since you can 't --
 Goodbye .


 So is Susan coming ?
 She said she might be a little late .
 They 've already started moving a few of Mike 's things over to her house .
 Already ? Wow ! Good for her .
 Yeah , it 's nice to see Susan so happy again .
 Yeah , I 'm happy for Susan .
 But don 't you think she and Mike are moving a little fast ?
 Two days ago , she was thinking he was a murderer , and now she 's moving in with him ?
 Hnn . - She found that was in self- defense .
 I think they 've cleared everything up .
 - Yeah , good point . Mike 's a decent guy .
 Yeah , that 's true .
 Of course , though -- with the gunshot wound --
 That 's right . Did he ever explain that ?
 No .
 And I know guns , and that wound was not self- inflicted . Mmm .
 And then , what about Mrs Huber 's blood- stained jewelry ?
 Yeah , that didn 't walk into Mike 's garage by itself .
 Maybe this is a mistake .
 There 's one thing I 've learned :
 Men can 't be trusted . Hold it .
 Are you saying that we should put a stop to this ?
 Well , I guess it wouldn 't hurt to sit her down and share our concerns .
 Yeah , we could do that .
 Tyah --
 Edie , do you want to be a part of it ?
 Well , normally I prefer not to get involved .
 But -- if there 's any way that I can help Susan ...
 We need to talk .
 OK .
 When I was packing up your stuff in your bedroom , I found a box of bullets .
 Oh .
 Look , I feel really bad about Deirdre , and I know you must want to find out who killed her .
 But if we 're moving in together , we can 't have this stuff hanging over us .
 You 've got to get rid of it .
 All of it . The file , the map , the gun ...
 Especially the gun . And leave this to the police .
 They 're the professionals .
 What can I say ?
 Seems like a reasonable request . Oh . Really ?
 That was easy .
 Maybe after lunch we could talk about your leather bean bag chair .
 " I realize now that I 've treated you badly .
 " I 'm the one who needs to get help , not you .
 " So I have to go away for a while .
 In the meantime , Mrs Tilman will look out for you .
 I don 't consider it a burden . You know you 're welcome here .
 " I left you some things .
 I hope you can take comfort in them .
 " I got you a new mitt .
 Work on your curveball while I 'm gone .
 " I love you .
 Dad . " I don 't understand ! Why wouldn 't he come see me ?
 Why just run away ?
 Your father 's been very troubled , dear .
 I 'm sure he did what he felt was best for you .
 And he wants me to take comfort in this junk ?
 I hate baseball ! You 'd think he would know that !
 Zach --
 Susan 's coming !
 - OK . OK , guys . Interventions are never pretty .
 So stay strong , ' cause she 's probably going to cry .
 Bon jour ! Oh , hi !
 I didn 't know the cooking lesson would be a group activity .
 Well , the more the merrier , right ?
 As long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crÃªpes .
 How come I 'm the only one wearing an apron ?
 I know it seems like we 're ganging up on you , but --
 You were moving so fast , we thought a sort of -- intervention was necessary .
 I know it 's tough to hear .
 And none of us wanted to do this .
 I appreciate what you guys are trying to do . I really do .
 Um -- I 'm not going to change my mind .
 In my life , I 've been hurt a lot .
 Karl , and , uh --
 Well , it just taught me to be cynical and expect the absolute worst from people .
 And I don 't want to live like that anymore .
 And when Mike asked me to move in with him ,
 I was just happy .
 Just ridiculously happy .
 I still am .
 I want to go with that feeling . I 'd love him , and I 'd love him !
 So I 'll expect the best from Mike , and I know he 'll deliver that in return .
 OK ?
 - Honey !
 - OK ! - That was so good --
 This is the worst intervention I 've ever been to .
 This is fun ! It 's forever since we had lunch .

 Well , as happy as I am to see you , I actually have an agenda .

 I ran into someone last week who said you guys were looking to hire .

 Is that true ?

 Yeah .
 Are you thinking of coming back ?

 Because , say the word , then I --

 No , not me .
 I was actually thinking more about Tom .
 Oh ! Tom .


 Yeah , he 's been thinking about making a move for a while .
 He kind of feels like he 's done everything he can where he is now .


 Well , Tom 's certainly -- solid .
 He 's more than solid .
 Tom 's ideas are spectacular .

 He 's passionate about his work .
 His visual instincts are off the chart .

 Is he as good as you ?
 He 's -- apples , I 'm oranges .
 We excel in different areas .

 Trust me , you should give Tom a look .
 I don 't need apples .
 I need someone like you .
 Cut- throat .
 Ruthless .

 Jeez , Nat !
 You make me sound like some kind of shark .
 Ah !
 OK !
 You know , actually , if that 's the kind of exec you 're looking for --

 You got a shark for me ?
 Yes .

 A very pretty shark .

 So , here 's what I 'm thinking .
 I 'll see if Dr Morrisson at the Lipstone Clinic can come in and consult .

 You want to bring someone else in ?
 Your body isn 't responding to the medication the way it should .

 And the tests we 've run have all come back negative , so I --

 I just want to be on the safe side .

 Excuse me .

 I need to take this .

 I don 't know why , but I have this overwhelming feeling that you 'll be fine .

 I really do .
 Lee Craig has the biggest ego of any doctor I know .
 If he wants to consult with someone , that means he 's stomped .

 Which means I 'm screwed .
 Don 't say that .
 - Damn it , Bree ! Do you understand what 's going on here ?

 I could die !

 So could I.
 What ?

 I could walk across the street tomorrow and be hit by a car .
 What in God 's name is your point ?
 All I 'm saying is that we 're both going to die eventually .

 And that the time we have left , whether it 's two days or two decades ,

 I think that we should be nice to each other .

 You 're right .

 Um , Ms Tilman --
 Paul Young 's been missing the last couple of days .
 Have you seen him ? Why ask me ?
 I saw him leave a box on your doorstep , and I 've also seen Zach over here .
 If I did know where Mr Young was , why would I tell you ?
 Look , um --
 The police think I killed your sister , and I 'm sure you do , too .
 But I swear to you , I had nothing to do with it .
 And you think Paul Young did ?
 Well -- no , that 's not what I 'm saying .
 You 've got to admit , it 's a neat theory .
 Care for a snack ?
 ... and so , it 's not such a stretch .
 I wonder if Paul avenged his wife 's death by killing Martha for blackmailing them .
 But perhaps I 'm alone in there .
 You 're not .
 Aren 't you sweet .
 Tea ?
 - Thanks .
 Do these journals say anything about why your sister was blackmailing the Youngs ?
 But I 'd gotten a definite impression that it involved a murder , and now here you are saying your friend was murdered ... Not specifically .



 Any reason you haven 't shown these to the police ?
 Are you in favor of the death penalty ?
 Um -- yeah .
 So am I. We had it in Utah .
 Not in this state though .
 A shame .
 Don 't you agree ?
 Yeah , I do .
 I like you so much , Mr Delfino .
 You know where Paul Young is ?
 I 'm afraid not .
 But I know where he 'll be on Thursday night .



 Hey babe . Wanna go online and check out schools ?
 What 's going on ?
 I just want to say goodbye , because I 'm leaving you .
 What ?
 Your health insurance sent us a letter because someone ordered a year 's worth of my birth control pills .
 And apparently our policy doesn 't cover drugs bought by the kilo .
 I told you it was MamÃ¡ !
 The prescription was dated , Carlos .
 And Juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed !
 You did this , not your mother !
 At least be man enough to own up to it .
 She would have been .

 Stop ! - Uh- uh ! I 'm pregnant , Caveman , remember ?
 Where are you going ?
 Away !
 I 'm going to jail !
 I 'll be gone tomorrow !
 I know . That 's why I only packed one bag .
 What about the baby , Gabrielle ?
 Huh ? What about my baby ?
 Oh , your baby ?
 Fine , baby !
 Hey , we 're a family now !
 This baby needs its mother its father !
 Oh Carlos .
 Whoever said you were the father ?
 Hey !
 Hey .
 Hey !
 What the hell are you doing ?
 Damn felon !
 All units , code D- 16- 30 .
 Suspect is in violation of house arrest .
 Currently heading west on Parker Blvd .
 This is unit 14 , we 're on our way .
 They say the Feds have a runner .
 - Let 's go .
 Is John here ?
 If I say no , are you going to slap me again ?
 He 's working . Why ?
 I just left my husband .
 Hang on !
 You think just because you mow my lawn you could bang my wife ?
 Whoa !
 - Hey , hey , hey !

 Hey .
 What 's going on ?
 Oh Tom , I have had the craziest day .
 This morning , the guy of Spermetual Incurrence called me , and -- they offer me a job !
 Are you going to take it ?
 I told Peterson about it .
 He just upped their offer ! He just made me vice president !
 O -- of what ?
 Tom ! The firm !
 He gave me Duggan 's old job ! Isn 't that wild ?
 I gotta go tell Scottie .
 I 'll see you later !
 Oh Tom , I was just coming to find you .
 What the hell , Dan ?
 I mean , what the hell ? !
 You promoted Annabelle over me ?
 She got a little job offer .
 I couldn 't afford to lose her .
 Not now . Well guess what , you lose me !
 ' Cause I quit !
 Tom , don 't overreact .
 No . The first time you passed me by , I took it like a good soldier .

 But since Duggan 's heart attack , I have already been doing the job !
 I have been doing it ! And then you just hand it to Annabelle ?
 OK . You made your point .
 Wha -- ? You make crappy decisions on a daily basis , Dan , I gotta tell you .
 But this one , this is the stupidest .
 Hey , watch yourself .
 You have been running this company into the ground since you got here .
 The way I see it , I 'm getting out easy .
 All right , Scavo . You want to know why I gave that promotion to Annabelle ?
 Why she got the nod instead of you ?
 It was Lynette .
 What ?
 She went to my wife and begged her to get me to kill your promotion .
 She said that if you start travelling more , it 'll hurt your family .
 She did that ?
 Now I feel like a chum for trying to help you guys out .
 I guess that was another one of my " crappy decisions " .
 Have your desk cleaned up by tonight .
 You wouldn 't tell us what you got against this kid ?
 It 's between him and me . And my wife .
 Is that what this is about ? You doin ' his wife ?
 No .
 I 'm gay .
 You 're gay ? - What ?
 I 'm gay .
 Ahh , this is not happening again ...
 What do you mean , again ?
 I want a lawyer .
 George !
 Hi !
 What are you doing here ? I 'm shopping , obviously .
 Why are you shopping here ?
 You live on the other side of town .
 My friend had an operation , I 'm buying her some things .
 Oh .
 Well , that 's very nice of you .
 Wait , Bree .
 I have to tell you something .
 Well ?
 You need to tell Rex to be more discreet when it comes to discussing your love life .
 I 'm sorry ?
 I don 't want to say anything more .
 You just really need to tell him that .
 Wait a minute !
 What in the world are you talking about ?
 I was at the hospital , to see my friend who had had this operation , and I overheard two doctors talking about Rex 's fondness for --
 S& M.
 You heard that ?
 Apparently , he told them he has a -- box of toys , and he -- gets you to do -- very inappropriate things .

 I see .
 Bree , this is clearly none of my business , and I would have never brought this up , but hear these two men laughing about you ...
 I just thought you should know .
 Thank you for telling me , but I think I 'm --
 I gotta go .
 Hey , got some more boxes .
 That 's your answer to everything these days .
 So what do you think we should do for dinner ?
 Oh , I -- I can 't .
 I just got an emergency phone call .
 A busted water main .
 - OK . I 'll keep it warm for you .
 You know , I 'm -- afraid I 'll be too late for dinner .
 I wasn 't talking about dinner .
 Need some help ?
 - Uh , no .
 No , I got it .

 So if you have a plumbing emergency , shouldn 't you get going ?
 Um , they 've already got somebody on it .
 I 'm just part of the relief crew .
 Oh . Well , I 'll just get back to work .
 Mom -- stalking ?
 Are you really doing this ?
 You just made such a huge deal to your friends about how much you trust him now .
 That was before I found Mrs Huber 's journal in his truck .
 So -- what 's in it ?
 It 's not about what 's in it .
 It 's about the fact that he had it at all .
 I would bet you anything he 's not going on a plumbing job , and we 're going to find out .
 Mom --
 If you don 't trust him , why are you moving in with him ?
 I don 't have time to explain adult relationships to you .
 Duck down !
 I think you lost him .
 - He 's six cars up .
 We have to stay this far back , or he 'll see us .
 OK , great , but we can 't see him either .
 I gotta tell you , Mom , you 're not great at this .
 Oh yeah ?
 When your father was cheating on me , I used to follow him all the time .
 I know my stuff .
 Here he is .
 What 's Mike doing ?
 Who 's that he 's pulling up to ?
 I don 't know , but I 'm going to find out .
 What are you -- ?
 Unlock the doors .
 All right , what the hell are you up to ? Oh my God . Wow .
 Um --
 OK .
 Oh !
 Wow .
 Uh -- Goodbye !
 Was that your wife ?
 If that was my wife , do you think I 'd be here with you ?
 It wasn 't Mike , was it ?
 No .
 No , it wasn 't .
 They 're charging you with a hate crime ?
 You remember when our cable guy was beaten up ?
 That was me .
 I thought you were cheating with him !
 With our gay cable guy ?
 I didn 't know he was gay !
 I didn 't know Justin was either !
 Now the cops think I 'm some kind of serial gaybasher .
 Well , you sort of are .
 You provoked me !
 You were pretending to have an affair just to punish me !
 Well , obviously !
 So now I need you to lie again .
 I need you to tell the cops you having an affair , and that I just beat up the wrong guy .
 Guys .
 I am not lying for you , Carlos .
 Gabby , if this charge sticks , I get sent away for eight years .
 Am I supposed to be impressed ?
 Because of your little stunt with my birth control pills , I 've lost my freedom for the next years !
 Gabby , please don 't do this .
 Gabby !
 Don 't walk away !
 Gabby !
 OK , next time I won 't bring my daughter to stalk my boyfriend .
 It was a slight error in judgement .
 Honey , please don 't give me the silent treatment .
 I 'm not .
 Did you say you read this ?
 Yeah , part of it . Why ?
 Mrs Huber was blackmailing Zach 's mom .
 Zach ?
 What are you doing up ?
 Couldn 't sleep , so I was just -- sitting here .
 Thinking .
 About what ?
 Do you really want to know ?
 Bree --
 I 'm not feeling too hot right now .
 So just tell me . What 's up ?
 I was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire life was agreeing to marry you .
 Let me guess .
 I 've done something wrong .
 Forcing me into sharing your depraved pastime wasn 't bad enough ?
 You had to share my humiliation with your co- workers ?
 What ?
 Rex , everybody is talking about our sex life .
 Every sordid little detail , right down to that box of perversions you keep in the closet !
 Bree , I never said anything to anyone , I swear to God !
 You 're a liar . Who told you this ?
 Doesn 't matter .
 It does matter , because I never said anything !
 Then how do people know ?
 Because we both know that I wouldn 't say anything !
 Why would I tell people about what we do in bed ?
 [ --- ]
 Maybe you were bragging .
 Or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me .
 Congratulations , you did it !
 I am officially destroyed !
 I didn 't say anything ! - I don 't believe you . Oh .
 Oh .
 Rex ?
 What ?
 What is it ? I think I 'm having a heart attack .
 No , you 're not .
 Bree , you 're going to have to take me to the hospital . Um --
 All right , you -- go downstairs and , um ,
 I will be -- I 'll be right there .
 Daddy ?
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm waiting for your mother to take me to the Emergency Room .
 What 's wrong ?
 - I 'm having a heart attack .
 Oh my God , where is she ?
 That 's a good question .
 Daddy says he 's having a heart attack .
 I know . I 'm going to take him to the hospital .
 Well , when ?
 When I finish making the bed .
 What ?
 I never leave the house with an unmade bed .
 You know that .
 But Daddy needs to go the hospital .
 There . Now we can go .
