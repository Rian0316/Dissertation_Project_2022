 NAOMl :
 I was picking up my dry cleaning , and there was his car , parked across the street at some seedy motel .
 You still want to make love to me ?
 - Yeah .
 - I 'm free today at 4 : 00 .
 Where should we go ?
 You 're a man now ; figure it out .
 There 's no way I 'm getting into your mobile sex den .
 You seem , uh ... energized .
 Do I ?
 Have you embarked on a new exercise regimen ?
 I plan on working out as often as I can .

 ELl :
 You know what ?
 We 've already got an open marriage ...
 I 'll ask her for a three- way .
 If she says no ...
 She says yes .
 Oh , my God .

 TAYLOR :
 - because of your career .
 - Are you in love with her ?
 No .
 BETH ANN :
 why he feels the need to cheat ?
 He was bored with his wife .
 SHElLA : It 's a manual .
 For married couples .
 These are dirty pictures .

 It begins quite slowly .
 With a look .
 Or a gesture .
 And once the invitation is accepted ...
 The tango begins .
 It is a dance of anticipation .
 - Seduction .
 - Desire .
 And love .
 You know , some say it takes two to tango .
 But sometimes , lurking in the dark ...
 Is a third .
 Now , if you choose to dance with him , be prepared to deal with the consequences .
 For passion can turn to jealousy .
 Love can become violent .
 Yes .
 The tango exists to remind us the greatest love stories ...
 End in death .
 ( gasping )
 Just a reminder ,
 I 've got that project due tomorrow .
 So you 'll be working late again ?
 Afraid so .
 Sorry , honey .
 What are your big plans for the day ?
 Oh , nothing interesting .
 Need to drop by the dry cleaners .
 After that , I 'll go to the market for some shopping .
 And then I might have lunch with a new friend .

 This is your phone number .
 Oh , I thought you should have it , now that we 're getting to be chums .
 This way , if you ever need someone to go with you to the movies ...
 I can call you up . Got it .
 Now , I rent a room from a lovely couple .
 The wife 's name is also Sheila . - Oh .
 - So , if you call and she answers ...
 Then I 'll ask for the other Sheila .
 Exactly . Busy this week ?
 Uh , my schedule is pretty open , except for tonight .
 I have a date .
 ( laughs )
 With your married man ?
 He finished some big project at work .
 To celebrate , he got us reservations at this really fancy night club .
 He 's taking you out ?
 In public ?
 For the first time .
 It 's like an actual boyfriend .
 ( laughs )
 Isn 't that nice ?
 ( kissing , moaning ) ( laughs ) ( chuckles )
 What are you smiling about ?
 Oh , the absurdity of it all .
 I 'm having the best sex of my life in the back of a catering van .
 Well , maybe when Mr. Grove moves out , we could start doing this in your bed .
 Yes ...
 So , about that ...
 Karl may be staying in my home longer than we discussed .
 How much longer ? A week ?
 Longer .
 Two weeks ?
 He won 't be leaving until after my daughter 's wedding .
 ( stammers ) Whoa , whoa , whoa .
 ( chuckles )
 That 's two months away .
 Well , I don 't mind the van .
 No , that 's- that 's not the point .
 Simone , he cheated on you with men .
 Why would you let him stay for five more seconds ?
 Well , I tried to throw him out .
 - And he wouldn 't go ?
 - He said that if I made him leave , he would tell all my friends he was gay and embarrass me before the wedding .
 So he 's threatening you ?
 No , it 's just a little light blackmail .
 All right .
 I 'll take care of this .
 What does that mean ?
 Nothing .
 I 'm just gonna convince him that he 's making a mistake .
 ( gasps ) That 's adorable .
 Hey , I 'm serious .
 Please , let me help .
 Absolutely not .
 I 'm not gonna break any bones .
 I 'm just gonna bend some stuff .
 Tommy , how do you expect our secret affair to remain secret once you 've been arrested by the police for beating up my husband ?
 I was just spitballing .
 Well , I appreciate the passion , but save it for the van .
 I 'd still love to meet Karl alone in a dark alley some night .
 Careful .
 He might enjoy that .
 Yes .
 Um , no , I understand , it 's just that I 've been through the deposition twice and I couldn 't find anything useful .

 I forgot all about it .
 Simone , you 're in charge of the decorations . It 's fine .
 I ordered everything weeks ago .
 My mind 's been elsewhere because of recent events .
 Are you still up for your number ?
 Simone promised the two of you would reprise your dance .

 Oh , did she ?
 I 'm not sure I 'm up for it now , given recent events .
 Well , if you don 't do something ,

 Yes .

 I 'm the one who should be miffed .
 Why didn 't you tell me Naomi saw my car at a motel ?
 We 're lucky that 's all she saw .

 It was never anonymous .
 And only a few of them were strange .

 I am not the audience for that joke .
 - What you doing ?
 - Benefit 's in two days .
 We need to rehearse .
 Ugh , what was I thinking ?
 I can 't dance with you , I 'm still furious .
 You 'll forget all about that when we 're the center of attention , drowning in applause .
 Stop trying to charm your way back into my heart .
 It won 't work .

 I 'd get rid of the dress .
 If I 'm to convince April it 's not in her best interest to date a married man , first I must become her confidant .

 Eli , get off .
 No , you 're gonna get out and you 're gonna talk to me right now ,
 Taylor .
 Really ?
 Just talk to me , Taylor .
 What 's going on ?
 Come on .
 I asked you before if you were in love with her .
 I- I know , I know .
 - You lied to me .
 - Not exactly .
 Then what the hell are we doing in the driveway ?
 Eli , come on , please .
 This is , this is too hard !
 - What ?
 - I- I don 't know . - What ?
 - My life , my I ... my life is so hard !
 I- I ...
 The hours I work , the cases I take .
 And then I come home to this house .
 This big , fucking house that we can 't afford !
 And I have to pay for it because you haven 't sold a script in two years .
 But I can 't bring that up because then I 'm a bitch .
 So I say nothing .
 And Jade is the only thing in my life that is easy .
 ' Cause she doesn 't take .
 She only gives .
 If she leaves , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do .
 Why didn 't you tell me any of this before ?
 Come on .
 I don 't want to hurt you .
 Oh , well , great call .
 ' Cause it hurts .
 So , I mean ...
 Do you want me to go ?
 No .
 Eli , I love you .
 But you want her to stay .
 I mean ...
 How does that even work ?
 I don 't know .
 I don 't .
 But it has to .
 Because otherwise , it 's just too hard to be married to me .
 No .
 Eli ...
 ( door opens ) ( sighs ) ( door closes ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( lively music playing )
 I got fired .
 I 'm not surprised .
 What you did was childish .
 - He was grabbing you .
 - He was holding my hand .
 - Why do you keep defending him ?
 - I 'm not .
 He 's lied to you , he 's cheated on you and he won 't leave your home .
 The situation is complicated .
 Well , yeah , it must be , because it makes no sense .
 - You should hate him . - I know , I know , it 's just ...
 He 's my husband .
 He puts up with my extravagance and my nonsense .
 He tells me I 'm beautiful when I need to hear it the most and ... he makes me laugh in a way that no one else can .
 Simone ...
 One day , I will divorce Karl , but I will never hate him , because I can 't .
 Where does that leave me ?
 In the back of a van having a marvelous time .
 Yeah , well , van came with the job , so ...
 Don 't worry .
 We 'll figure it out .
 Mrs. Grove .
 Mrs. Harte says it 's time for your number .
 Thank you .
 I have to go .
 ( door opens )
 Hi .
 ( whispers ) :
 Hey .
 Listen , about tonight , I 'm so sorry .
 - You don 't have to apologize .
 - No , I do .
 I really do .
 Thank you .
 So , I decided to go to Venice with Mischa and Willow .
 Oh .
 JADE :
 It 's time .
 Being here with you and Eli , it 's ... ... starting to feel like a home .
 I 'm getting attached .
 Which always leads to me getting hurt .
 When it ends .
 So ...
 I should go .
 ELl :
 What if it doesn 't have to end ?
 What if you stayed ?
 What if this was your home ?
 Here with us .
 ( Jade stammers )
 What are you saying ?
 Live with us .
 Be with us .
 Yeah .
 There 's no reason to leave .
 You just got home .
 ( door opens )
 Hi .
 Oh , you 're still up .
 Of course .
 Did you get your work finished ?
 Yep .
 I redid the whole project .
 It took forever .
 I 'm gonna make myself a martini , take a shower and go to bed . I could fix you a snack if you like . No .



 All right .
 Would it bother you if I played the piano for a bit ?
 It 's after midnight . I know .
 If you 'd rather I didn 't ...
 Nah .
 Whatever you want .

 They weren 't there .
 Check again .
 - Honey ! - ( piano stops )
 It 's not really a martini without an olive .

 Thanks .
 You know , it is so late .
 We should turn in .
