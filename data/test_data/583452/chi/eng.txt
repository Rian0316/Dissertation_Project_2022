 Guys , Iook ! Ugly Naked Guy 's putting stuff in boxes .
 I 'd say our naked buddy is moving .
 IronicaIly , most of the boxes seem to be Iabeled " Clothes . "
 I 'm going to miss that big old squishy butt .
 And we 're done with the chicken fried rice .
 If he 's moving , maybe I should try to get his place ! It would be so cooI to Iive across from you guys .
 We could do that telephone thing . . . . . . where you have a can , we have a can . . . . . . and it 's connected by a string .
 Or we could do the actuaI telephone thing .

 Oh , my God .
 I love this apartment !
 Isn 't it perfect ? I can 't believe I never realized how great it is !
 Because your eye goes to the big naked man .
 It 's amazing ! Hurry up with an application , or I 'II beat you to it .

 WeIl , I 'm going to use Ugly Naked Guy 's bathroom .
 Look ! There 's Monica and Chandler .
 Hey , you guys !


 Chandler and Monica !
 Oh , my God !
 Oh , my eyes !
 My eyes ! It 's okay !
 - They 're doing it ! - I know !
 - I know ! - You know ? Yes , I know it .
 Joey knows , but Ross doesn 't , so stop screaming !
 What 's going on ?
 - What ? - Nothing !
 We are so excited that you 'II get this apartment ! Looks reaIly good .
 Looks pretty good !
 Get in here ! Come on !


 You mean whenever Monica and Chandler . . . . . . were doing Iaundry or going grocery shopping ?
 The time Monica spent on the phone with Linda from camp ?
 Doing it , doing it , phone , doing it . I can 't believe it !
 I think it 's great . For him .
 She could do better . Hey , you guys .
 Come here !
 Phoebe found out about Monica and Chandler .
 You mean how they 're friends and nothing more ?

 Joey , she knows .
 We saw them doing it through the window .
 ActuaIly , we saw them doing it up against the window .
 So they know you know , and they don 't know RacheI knows ?
 Yes , but it doesn 't matter who knows what . Now enough of us know that we could just teII them we know .
 AII the Iying and the secrets wiII finaIly be over .
 Or , we could not teII them we know , and have a Iittle fun .
 What do you mean ?
 If they say they are doing Iaundry , we 'II give them Iaundry to do .
 I would enjoy that .
 You know what would be even more fun ?
 TeIling them . No , I want to do Phoebe 's thing . I can 't take --
 You don 't have to do anything . Just don 't teII them we know .
 I can 't take anymore secrets . I got your secrets , their secrets , secrets of my own .

 You don 't have any secrets .
 WeIl , you don 't know about Hugsy , my bedtime penguin pal .

 How are we going to mess with them ?
 You could use your position as the roommate .
 And I would use the strongest tooI at my disposal .
 My sexuality .
 HeIlo , children . Watch .
 Learn . And don 't eat my cookie .

 That jacket Iooks great on you .
 - ReaIly ? - The materiaI is so soft .
 HeIlo , Mr. Bicep . You 're working out ?
 I try to squeeze things .

 Are you okay ? If you reaIly want to know --
 I can 't teII you this .
 You can teII me anything .
 ActuaIly , you are the one person I can 't teII this to .
 And the one person I want to the most .
 What 's going on ?
 I just haven 't been with a guy in so Iong . . . . . . and sometimes you 're Iooking for something . . . . . . and it 's right there in front of you , sipping coffee . . . .
 Oh , no .
 Have I said too much ?
 Just something to think about . I know I wiIl .



 You are so cute . How did you get to be so cute ?
 My grandfather was Swedish .
 And my grandmother was a tiny Iittle bunny .
 Now you 're even cuter .
 You know , that is a popular opinion today , I must say .
 The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse .
 Phoebe was hitting on me .
 What are you talking about ? I think Phoebe thinks I 'm foxy .

 It 's not possible .
 I 'm sorry , Phoebe 's just always thought you were charming . . . . . . in a sexless kind of way .
 You know , I can 't hear that enough .
 I just think you misunderstood her . I didn 't , okay ? She was aII over me .
 She touched my bicep , for crying out Ioud .
 This bicep ? WeIl , it 's not flexed right now .


 Mon , you want to come see a movie with us ?
 ActuaIly , I was going to do some Iaundry .
 Want to do it with me ?
 Sure , I 'II do it with you . Okay , great .
 Hold on a second .
 Here you go . That would reaIly help me out a Iot .
 Thanks . You know what ?
 I don 't have enough quarters .
 I have quarters !

 Hey , any word on the apartment yet ?
 I caIled there , and it turns out Naked Guy is subletting it .
 He 's already had 1 00 applicants . No , I 've got the edge .
 It 's not exactly ethical , but I sent him a bribe . . . . . . to tip the scales in my direction .
 You can see it from the window .
 Is it that pinbaII machine with the big bow on it ?
 That new mountain bike ?

 What did you send ?
 A basket of mini muffins .
 There 's a whole table of them .
 Which one did you send ?
 The smaII one . You actuaIly thought that basket was going to get you the apartment ?
 Someone sent us a basket at work , and people went crazy over those muffins .
 It was the best day . Your work makes me sad .
 Oh , man , I want that place so much !
 And I was so sure that was going to work .
 There 's 1 2 bucks I 'II never see again . We 'd better go if we want to catch that movie .
 Bye . Bye , Chandler .
 I miss you already .

 Did you see that ? The inappropriate , and the pinching ?
 ActuaIly , I did . So do you believe that she 's attracted to me ?
 Oh , my God !
 She knows about us ! Are you serious ?
 She knows , and she 's trying to freak us out !
 That 's the only explanation !
 But what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps ? She knows !




 Phoebe knows about us . I didn 't teII them !
 Them ? Who 's " them " ?
 Phoebe and Joey . And Rachel .
 I would have told you , but I promised not to teIl .
 I 'm sorry .
 But it 's over now , right ?
 You can teII them you know they know , and I can go back to knowing nothing ! Unless --
 Not " unless " !
 This must end now ! They think they are so slick messing with us .
 But they don 't know that we know that they know .
 So --
 The messers become the messees !


 Honey , you got to stop torturing yourself . Why don 't you find another apartment ?
 I 've already Iooked at 1 000 apartments this month .
 None of them even compares to that one .
 You know what ?
 You should find out his hobbies and use that to bond with him .
 Like if I wanted something from Joey . . . . . . I would strike up a conversation about sandwiches . . .
 . . . or my underwear .
 I 'm Iistening .
 That is a great idea !
 And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we 've been watching him for five years .
 So that gives me back my edge !
 Let 's see now . He had the trampoline .
 He broke that .
 - He had gravity boots . - He broke those too . So he Iikes to break stuff .
 I 've got to go pick up Ben .
 But I wiII figure something out .
 Didn 't he used to have a cat ? I wouldn 't bring that up .
 It would bum him out . Poor cat never saw that big butt coming .

 Hold on a second , she 's right here .
 It 's Chandler . HeIlo , you .
 Phoebe , I 've been thinking about you aII day .
 You know that thing you said before ?
 I was intrigued .
 ReaIly ? Joey won 't be here tonight .
 Why don 't you come over ? I 'II Iet you feeI my bicep .
 Or maybe more .
 I 'II have to get back to you on that .
 He wants me to come over and feeI his bicep and more !
 Are you kidding ? I cannot believe he would do that to Mon --

 Joey ?
 Do they know that we know ?
 They know you know .
 I knew it ! I cannot believe those two !
 They thought they could mess with us ? Trying to mess with us ?
 They don 't know that we know they know we know .

 Joey , you can 't say anything . Couldn 't if I wanted to .
 Good evening , sir . I 'm Ross GeIler . I 'm one of the applicants .
 I realize that the competition is fierce but . . . .
 I 'm sorry , I can 't help but notice that you 're naked .
 I applaud you . Man , I wish I was naked .
 I mean , this Iooks so great .
 That is how God intended it .
 Look .
 They 're panicked !
 They 'II totaIly back down . If he wants a date , he 's going to get a date .
 I 'm going to go in . Be sexy . Please .


 I 'd love to come by tonight .

 ReaIly ? Absolutely . Say , around seven ?

 I 'm reaIly Iooking forward to you and me having sexuaI intercourse .

 Hey , check it out !
 Naked Guy 's got a naked friend .
 Oh , my God !
 That 's our friend ! It 's Naked Ross !

 Showtime !
 Rachel , get me perfume .
 Joey , can you get me a bottle of wine and glasses ?
 Make her think you want to have sex with her and it wiII freak her out .
 How far would I have to go with her ?
 She 'II give in way before you do .
 How do you know ?
 Because you 're on my team . My team always wins . At this ?
 Just go get some ! Go !
 Now , I 'm going to try to Iisten from right here . Oh , wait .
 Good idea .
 Don 't give away the farm .
 Come on in . I was going to .
 I brought some wine .
 Would you Iike some ?
 Sure .


 So here we are . Nervous ? Me ?
 No .
 You ? I want this to happen .
 So do I.

 I 'm going to put on some music .
 Maybe I 'II dance for you .




 You Iook good .
 Thanks .
 You know , when you say things Iike that , it makes me . . . . . . want to rip that sweater vest right off .
 Why don 't we move into the bedroom ?
 ReaIly ?
 Do you not want to ?
 First I want to take off aII my clothes . . . . . . and have you rub Iotion on me .
 That would be nice .
 I 'II go get the Iotion .
 It 's way out of hand .
 She wants me to put Iotion on her !
 - She 's bluffing !
 - She 's not backing down . She went Iike this --

 He 's not backing down . He went to get Iotion .
 Aren 't you guys done yet ? I want to sit in my chair !
 The sooner Phoebe breaks him , the sooner it 's over and out in the open .
 I Iike that .
 Show him your bra .
 He 's afraid of bras . Can 't work them .

 You didn 't rip off any buttons . It 's not my first time .
 Go back there and seduce her tiII she cracks !
 Give me a second . - Did you clean up in here ?
 - Of course !
 You 're going ?
 Not without you , Iover .

 So , this is my bra .
 It 's very , very nice .
 WeIl , come here .
 I 'm very happy we 're going to have aII the sex .
 You should be . I 'm very bendy .

 I 'II kiss you now . Not if I kiss you first .




 I guess there 's nothing Ieft for us to do but kiss . Here it comes .
 Our first kiss .

 You win !
 I can 't have sex with you ! - And why not ? - I 'm in love with Monica !
 You 're what ?
 Love her !
 I love her ! I love her !
 I love you , Monica .
 I love you too , Chandler .
 I thought you were doing it .
 I didn 't know you were in Iove !
 Dude !
 Hats off to Phoebe .
 Quite a competitor .
 May I say your breasts are stiII showing ?
 God .
 AII right !
 So that 's it ?
 It 's over .
 Everybody knows !
 ActuaIly , Ross doesn 't .
 We 'd appreciate it if no one told him yet .



 A new place for a new Ross .
 I 'II have you and the guys from work over , once it 's furnished .
 It 's nice to see you back on your feet .
 I am that , and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me .
 I wonder if it 's time for you to rejoin our museum team ?
 That would be great .
 I am totaIly ready to come back to work .
 What are you doing ?
 Get off my sister !
