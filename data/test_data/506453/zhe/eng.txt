 Thank you , George .
 From the point of view of the criminal expert ,
 London has become a singularly odd , interesting city .
 Well , I hardly think you 'll find ... ... many decent citizens to agree with you .
 Well , well , well , one must not be selfish .
 The community 's the gain , and no one the loser say the poor , unfortunate specialist whose occupation was got .

 You must have been totally ...
 There 's the case of the papers of ex- President ... ... and shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Treesman , which very nearly cost us both our lives .

 Both of them great successes .
 I 'm sorry , Mr. Holmes is not at home .
 If I fail to see him now , it will be too late .
 But I 'm sorry , I cannot help you .
 But it is a matter of the utmost urgency .
 I have already told you , young man , Mr. Holmes ... Mr. Holmes .
 Well , I must see you .
 I told the young man you weren 't here , but he wouldn 't listen .
 I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , but I 'm nearly out of my mind .
 I am the unhappy John Hector McFarland .


 Now , tell us quietly and slowly who you are ... ... and what it is that you want .
 You mentioned your name just now ... ... as if I should recognize it , but I can assure you , beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor , a solicitor and a free mason and an asthmatic ,
 I know nothing about you whatever .

 Your untidy clothes , sheaf of legal papers , watch chain and your somewhat irregular breathing .
 Why , yes , Mr. Holmes , I am all these things .
 And in addition , I am at this moment , the most unfortunate man in London .
 I mean , I 've read your newspaper ...
 Not yet . Then , if you would allow me .



 ' At about 12 o 'clock last night , an instance occurred at Lower Norwood which points , it is feared , to a serious crime .
 A small timber yard caught fire at the back of a house ... ... belonging to Mr. Jonas Oldacre , a builder .
 Surprise was expressed at Mr. Oldacre 's absence , and it became apparent he had disappeared .
 An examination of his room ... ... revealed a safe which was open , signs of a murderous struggle , and a heavy walking stick ... ... with stains of blood upon the handle .



 As we ... ' All I ask is that you don 't abandon me .
 A man has followed me from London Bridge Station .
 If they arrest me before I finish my story , make them give me time ... ... so that I may tell you the whole truth .

 I could go to jail happy ... ... if I knew that you were outside working for me .
 Arrest you ? This is really most gratifying .
 On what charge do you expect to be arrested ?
 Upon the charge of murdering
 Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood .
 Dear me .



 ' As we go to press , sensational developments have been reported .
 Charred remains have been found ... ... among the ashes of the fire , and the police theory is that the victim ... ... was clubbed to death and the body ignited .
 It is known that Mr. Oldacre ... ... received a visitor last night , and the stick has been identified ... ... as belonging to that person , a young London solicitor , by the name of John Hector McFarland . '





 May I ask why you are still at liberty , Mr. McFarland , as there seems to be enough evidence ... ... to justify your arrest ?

 I live with my mother , at Torrington Lodge in Blackheath , but last night , having late business with Mr. Oldacre ,
 I stayed at a hotel in Norwood .

 Mr. Holmes , I knew nothing of this affair ... ... until I was on the train to my office this morning ... ... and read what you have just heard .



 I saw at once the terrible danger of my position ... ... and hurried to put the case in your hands .





 Ah , Inspector Le Strade , we have been expecting you .
 Mr. Holmes ?
 Dr. Watson ?
 Mr. John Hector McFarland ?
 Yes .
 I arrest you for the willful murder ... ... of Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood .
 Hold up , just one moment .
 A half an hour more or less ... ... could make little difference to you , and this young gentleman was about to give us an account ... ... of this very interesting affair , which might aid us in clearing it up .



 There will be no difficulty in clearing it up , thank you , Mr. Holmes .

 Nevertheless , I think with your permission ,
 I would be much interested in hearing his account .
 Well , Mr. Holmes , there 's no denying that you have been ... ... of use to the force ... ... once or twice in the past , but I must insist ...



 All I ask is that you should hear ... ... and recognize the absolute truth .


 I 'll give you half an hour .
 Sit down , McFarland .


 Thank you , Le Strade .
 We must warn you with what you say now ... ... will appear in evidence against you .
 Pray continue .
 I must first explain that I knew nothing ... ... of Mr. Jonas Oldacre , although his name was familiar to me .
 Many years ago , my parents were acquainted with him , but ... well , they drifted apart .
 And so it came as a complete surprise ... ... when yesterday afternoon , at about 3 o 'clock , he walked into my office in the city .

 ' Mr. Oldacre , good afternoon , I 'm Mr. McFarland .
 Would you care to come through ?

 Please , won 't you sit down ?


 How can I help you ?




 This is a draft of my Will .
 I want you , Mr. McFarland , to cast it into proper legal shape .
 I shall sit here while you do so .


 You can understand my astonishment , Mr. Holmes , when I found that , with some minor reservations , his entire estate had been left to me .
 ' But I ... I simply don 't understand .
 Well , then , let me explain .
 I 'm a bachelor , Mr. McFarland , with few relatives , and none who deserve my consideration .
 Well , that may well be so ...
 Let me ... let me finish . I beg your pardon .
 For many years now , I 've withdrawn from my business .
 I was a builder , and though I say it myself , an extremely successful one .
 Successful enough to have gained considerable wealth ... ... and thus live out my life in complete , if solitary , comfort .




 Many years ago , I knew your mother .
 Knew her , and hoped to marry her .
 Then she met and married your father .
 I had no idea .
 Well , and why should you ?
 Three months ago , why ,
 I read of your father 's death ... ... in The Daily Telegraph , and my mind was turned to your mother ... ... and to the son who might very well have been my own .
 This is my way of securing your future .
 I know that whatever I leave ... ... will be in worthy hands .
 What can I say , but thank you ?
 There are a few documents I think you should see ... ... building leases , title deeds , mortgages and so on .

 Well , now my mind 's made up ,
 I shan 't rest easy until the whole thing 's settled . Yes , of course . I beg you to come to my house tonight .
 What shall we say , 9 o 'clock ? Why , yes .
 You 'll of course bring the finalized Will , and then we can settle the matter once and for all .
 Yes , of course . Thank you , my boy .
 Oh , one last thing .
 Not a word of this to your dear mother ... ... until everything is settled .
 I want it to be a little surprised for her .
 Little , I ...
 You ... you promise ? You have my word .











 I left in good time for my appointment , but had difficulty in finding the house , so that it was nearly half- past before I reached it .




 Good evening .
 I have an appointment with Mr. Oldacre .
 Mr. McFarland ?
 Yes , that 's right .
 It was not the warmest of receptions .
 And the house itself had a peculiar , unloved feeling .

 Sorry to keep you waiting , my boy . Not at all , sir .
 I 'm a little late , I 'm afraid .
 Now , you brought the papers ? Yes , indeed .
 Excellent .


 The bedroom was on the ground floor ... ... where there was a large safe .

 ' Bring the rest of those papers , my boy .







 Now , to business .

 All done ?
 Yes , sir , all done .
 Just seen the time , my boy .
 You must get home .
 Oh , thank you .
 I had a stick with me .
 Ah , I wonder where she put it ?
 A rather heavy walking stick .
 It belonged to my father .
 Ah , never mind , I 'll take good care of it until we meet again .
 After all , I shall be seeing a great deal of you now , I hope .
 Indeed you shall , sir .
 I left him there .
 The safe was open , and the documents were on his desk .
 It was too late to go back to Blackheath , and so I spent the night at a hotel in Norwood .
 I knew nothing more of this horrible affair ... ... until this morning .





 Do you have the original draft of the Will ... ... that Oldacre brought to you ?

 Why , yes , I ... I have it here .

 May I retain this for 24 hours , Inspector ?
 It would amuse you .
 Well , anything more you 'd like to ask , Mr. Holmes ?
 Not until I 've been to Blackheath .
 You mean Norwood ?
 No doubt , that is what I must have meant .
 Now , Mr. McFarland , my Constable 's at the door , there 's a four- wheeler waiting .


 Morning , gentlemen .
 Morning .
















 There are certain points about this document , are there not Watson ?
 Well , I can read the first two lines ... ... and these in the middle of the second page ... ... and one or two at the end ,
 I mean , they 're as clear as print .
 But the writing in between is very bad , and there 's several places where I can 't read it at all .
 What do make of that ?
 What do you make of it ?
 That it was written on the train .
 The good writing represents stations , the bad writing movement , and the very bad writing ...
 Passing over the points ?
 A scientific expert would pronounce at once ... ... that it was drawn up on a suburban line .
 Since nowhere , save in the immediate vicinity of a great city , could there be so quick a succession of points .
 Granting that his whole journey ... ... was occupied in drawing up the Will , then the train must have been an express , stopping only once between Norwood and London Bridge .






 Yes , but it 's curious , is it not , that a man should draw up so important a document ... ... in so haphazard a fashion ?
 And it suggests that he thought ... ... it was going to be of no practical importance .
 Well , he drew up his death warrant at the same time .


 This case is not clear to me .
 Come , Watson .

 Where are we going , Norwood ?
 No , Blackheath . Come .






 My son 's the gentlest creature on God 's earth .
 It 's inconceivable he could even contemplate ... ... such a terrible crime .
 He didn 't even know the man , Mr. Holmes .
 But you did , Mrs. McFarland .





 Years ago .
 I 'd forgotten that he ever existed .
 I tried to forget .
 It 's impossible to quite forget ... ... a man like Jonas Oldacre .
 Yes , I knew him well .
 At one time , we were engaged to be married .

 Thank heaven I had the sense to turn away from him ... ... and marry a better , if poorer , man .

 Oh , please .
 Your husband died recently ?
 He was a kind man , gentle man .
 He was everything Jonas Oldacre was not .
 And yet , at one time , you were prepared to marry him ?
 I said that I knew him well , but the more I knew of him , the more I came to realize
 I knew him not at all .
 He would change suddenly , would also frighten me .
 There was a dark side to his character , Mr. Holmes .
 A desire to cause pain .




 My own photograph .
 It was my first present to him . Good heavens .

 That was how it was returned to me ... ... on my wedding day , together with a vile note ... ... urging a curse upon my house ... ... and saying he 'd never forgive me .
 And yet , he does seem to have forgiven you ... ... after all , to leave his entire estate to your son .
 Neither my son nor I want anything ... ... from that wicked man , dead or alive .
 Mrs. McFarland , the fact remains ... ... that the Will was made .
 I simply can 't understand it .
 Why ?
 Had you ever spoken of Oldacre to your son ?
 I mean , perhaps told him what you 've just told me now ?
 No , never .
 Never ?


 He found the photograph .


 My husband tried to make light of it , but he insisted .
 My husband told him something of the truth , that 's all .
 And the boy was disturbed ?
 He was upset , naturally .
 You see , Mrs. McFarland , what the police might say is , that he had heard of Oldacre 's behavior toward you .
 It would pre- dispose him toward hatred and violence .
 And so that case against him would be ... ... considerably strengthened .
 No .
 There is a God in heaven , Mr. Holmes , and that same God who 's punished that wicked man ... ... will show in his own good time , my son 's hands are guiltless of his blood .


 Wait here , please .


 Mr. Holmes , Dr. Watson .
 We 're just clearing up . The Will as promised .
 Look , buttons .
 Trouser buttons .
 No doubt , you 've brought your glass with you ?
 The name is Hiams .
 According to Mrs. Lexington , the housekeeper , Hiams , is the name of Mr. Oldacre 's tailor .
 Presumably , the organic remains ... ... have been removed to the laboratory ?
 They have , Doctor , though they 'll be of little use , I suspect .
 The poor devil was no more than bone and cinder .
 How very convenient for the murderer .
 Not , I might venture , for Mr. Oldacre .
 Nevertheless , Inspector , bones cinder .
 Thank heavens , he was wearing his trousers .
 This stick belongs to the accused , and he 's never denied it .
 He says that he could not find it ... ... when he came to leave the house .
 Says , Mr. Holmes , says .
 My experts made out footmarks ... ... of both men on the carpet .



 And too much subsequent traffic ... ... to make any examination on my part worthwhile .
 Two sets of footmarks , Mr. Holmes .
 None of any third person .
 Another trick for your side .
 I suppose all these papers are from the safe ?
 Correct .
 And nothing , absolutely nothing , has been removed ?
 Nothing whatsoever .
 We have opened one or two , as you can see , to check the contents .
 May I check them ?
 By all means .
 I , myself , have business at The Yard .
 Oh , and I would like to see the housekeeper ... ... what is her name ?
 Mrs. Lexington .
 She 'll add nothing more to what you already know . Nevertheless .
 I 'll send her in .



 Could it be that for once
 Le Strade is on the right track ?
 All my instincts are one way , and all the facts are the other .

 You wish to see me , sir ?
 Yes .
 Mrs. Lexington , this is my friend and colleague , Dr. Watson .
 Do sit down .
 I 'll stand , if I may .
 This room has no comfort for me .



 You let young Mr. McFarland into this house at 9 : 30 ?
 Yes . I wish that my hand had withered before I 'd done so .
 And you retired to bed at ?
 20 minutes past 11 : 00 .
 20 minutes past 11 : 00 .
 And you heard nothing ?
 My room is at the far end of the house .
 I heard nothing until the fire alarm sounded .
 It was then , only then , that I realized my poor master had been murdered .
 Mrs. Lexington , to your knowledge , did your master have any enemies ?
 Every man has his enemies .
 And a businessman like Mr. Oldacre , more than most , perhaps ?
 He was a well- respected gentleman ... ... who kept himself very much to himself .



 Do you know anything about these papers ?
 I know nothing ... ... of Mr. Oldacre 's private affairs .
 The buttons that the police found in the fire ?
 My master had three suits made by Mr. Hiams ... ... two are still in that wardrobe there , and the third he was wearing that night .
 Thank you , Mrs. Lexington , you have been most cooperative .



 What do you make of her ?
 Tight as wax , if you ask me , but then , perhaps that 's her usual manner ?
 It 's all wrong , I feel it in my bones , something ... something has not come out , and that woman knows it .



 Holmes , would you like me to have a look at these papers ?
 Well , a man 's bank account can tell us ... ... as much as his diary .
 Correct .
 Thank you , Watson .









 It 's all right Constable ,
 I 'm just stretching my legs .
 I 'll watch them .
















 Ah , Constable .
 Are you a local man ?
 Born on Bridge , sir , not a half- mile from here .
 Excellent .
 Then perhaps you can offer me some local knowledge ?
 I 'll do my best , sir ,
 I 'll most certainly do my best .
 Holmes .
 Le Strade did say that no documents had been removed ?
 Yes .
 That 's what I thought .
 You 've found something ?
 No , it 's what I haven 't found that interests me .
 There are certain cross- references ... ... to various deeds , valuable deeds , none of which I can find .
 But one thing is clear :
 Oldacre was hardly ... ... in the affluent circumstances ... ... we have been led to believe .
 His bank account was practically empty ,
 largely because he had made several large payments ... ... in the past year to a certain Mr. Cornelius .
 Young McFarland would have inherited nothing .
 This is of interest .
 Why should a retired builder ... ... have such large transactions with a Mr. Cornelius ?
 Well , let 's take our cab , and see what we can find out from his city bank .
 You coming ?
 I 'll stay here for awhile .

 Norwood Station .
 So , you 're not going back to London ... ... with your friend , then ?
 No , not yet , anyway .
 I do hope my presence doesn 't inconvenience you . By the way , I should warn you ,
 I found an undesirable lurking about by the gates .
 I saw him on ...
 An undesirable ?
 A tramp , Mrs. Lexington , a gentlemen of the road .
 He will get nothing here .
 Ah , you don 't believe in ... ... supporting our less fortunate brethren ?
 I work , so can they .
 Quite so .


















 I 'm on my way to Croxton .

 I 've done enough walking , I have ...
 To all kinds of places .
 I 'll stay put .

 I used to meet a friend of mine here .
 Oh , you might know him , he 's a seafaring man .
 Aha , I know him .
 Shared my billet for the last four nights , he does .
 And off he goes , without even a word .
 You take my tip .
 Stay clear of him .
 He 's a liar .
 He didn 't strike me as such .
 He goes up to that big house , he does .
 He comes back here and tells some yarn ... ... about him putting out with old mans , and telling him to come back tomorrow ... ... and they 'll give him some grub ... ... and some cast- offs for him .
 Well , how is that lying ?
 Because , my friend ,
 I already paid my call .
 I nearly got my lord on my back ... ... for my insolence ... ... insolence .

 Perhaps he told you a pleasing tale .
 Are you saying , that a drunken sailor has more to offer ... ... than a Sergeant in the 22nd ?
 No , no .
 He 's a liar .
 He says , 'Whatever I get , ' he says ,
 ' I 'll share with you , shipmate , ' he says .
 Off he goes .
 Not a sight of him since .





















 Holmes ,

 you must permit yourself some food .
 You must eat .
 A present , I cannot afford energy ... ... and nerve force for digestion .
 Well , you must if you intend to pursue this case .
 I feel , my dear fellow , that our case will end ingloriously ... ... by Le Strade hanging our client , which will certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard .
 There 's a telegram .
 ' Important fresh evidence at hand ,
 McFarland 's guilt definitely established , advise you to abandon case , Le Strade . '
 It is Le Strade 's little cockle- doodle of victory .

 Let 's have some breakfast ,
 and then go out together and see what we can do .
 I feel as if I shall need your company ... ... and moral support today .




 Ah , Mr. Holmes , Dr. Watson .
 I think you will acknowledge ... ... that we 're just a little in front of you this time .
 Step this way , if you please , gentlemen , and I 'm sure I can convince you ... ... that it was John McFarland ... ... who committed this crime .
 I don 't like being wrong any more than the rest of us do .
 Still , a man can 't always ... ... expect to have it his own way , can he Dr. Watson ?

 This is where the housekeeper left
 McFarland 's hat and stick , and this is also where he would have come ... ... to collect his hat after the crime was committed .
 Now , look at this .
 A thumb mark .
 So I observe .
 A thumb mark in blood .
 You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike ?
 I have heard something of the kind .


 Identical .
 And that was taken from McFarland this morning .
 Definitely the same thumb mark .
 And that is final .
 Quite final .
 Who made this discovery ?
 It was Mrs. Lexington here ... ... who drew my Constable 's attention to it .
 And , I suppose , there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday ?
 Well , of course McFarland could have crept out ... ... of jail in the middle of the night ... ... just to strengthen the evidence against himself . Ha- ha .
 Have you any objection if I take a stroll upstairs ?
 No , none at all .
 There 's nothing up there , though .


















 So many things look so bad , Holmes .
 But there is a serious flaw in this new evidence .

 What 's that ?
 That thumb print was not there ... ... when I examined the hall yesterday .






 Inspector Le Strade ,
 I cannot help thinking your evidence is incomplete .
 What do you mean , Mr. Holmes ?
 Merely that there is an important witness ... ... that you have not yet seen .
 You can produce this witness , can you ?
 I think I can .
 Well then , do so .
 I 'll do my best .
 How many Constables have you ?
 Three within call .
 Excellent .
 I assume that they are able- bodied ,
 large men with powerful voices ?
 No doubt that they are , yeah .
 In the outhouse , there is a quantity of straw .
 I would like two bundles brought in .
 Straw ?
 And two buckets of water .
 Water ?
 Ask them to bring it to the top landing .
 Straw , into the fireplace , a little bit in front .
 Two buckets of water to that side , Constable .
 Mr. Holmes .
 I don 't know whether you 're playing a game with us , but surely tell us without all this tom- foolery . I can assure you , Le Strade ,
 I have an excellent reason for everything that I do .
 Watson , would you put a match to that straw ?
 And Constable , will you sprinkle it with water ?


 Now , we must see ... ... if we can find this witness for you , Le Strade .
 Gentlemen , would you please join me and we 'll call a fire ... ... one , two three ... FlRE .







 Fire .
 We can do better than that .
 Full voice , and together .
 FlRE .




 Good heavens ,
 Constable , a bucket of water on that straw .
 Le Strade , allow me to present you ... ... with your missing principal witness , Mr. Jonas Oldacre .
 What 's this then ?
 What have you been doing all this time ?
 I 've done no harm .
 NO harm .
 You 've only done your best ... ... to get an innocent man hanged .
 If it wasn 't for this gentleman standing here , I 'm not sure you wouldn 't have succeeded .
 Take him .
 Let us see where this rat has been lurking .



 Now you see the advantage of being a builder , he was able to fix up his own little hiding place ... ... without any confederate , save for that precious housekeeper of his , whom I should lose no time in adding to your bag , Inspector .


 And these are the missing papers , no doubt ?
 No doubt whatsoever .
 Constable , find the housekeeper .
 How did you know about that place , Mr. Holmes ?
 When I compared the proportions of this room ... ... with those of the room below ,
 I deduced that this fireplace wall was false .
 Oldacre clearly had a great deal of nerve , but little enough , I 've found , to like quiet before an alarm of fire .

 How in the world did you know ... ... that he was in the house at all ? The thumb mark , Le Strade .
 When I examined the hall yesterday , it was clear .
 Therefore , it must have been put there during the night .
 But how ?
 After McFarland had examined the papers that night , he resealed them .
 To do so , he used his thumb upon the wax .
 Brooding in that den of his , it suddenly struck Oldacre ... ... what use he could make of that thumbprint .
 Smearing the wax with a little blood , he made what appeared to be absolutely ... ... damning evidence against McFarland .
 But what was the object of his deception ?
 Ah , well , you see Inspector , in order to swindle his creditors , who were pressing him ,
 Oldacre emptied his bank account by paying out ... ... several large sums to a certain Mr. Cornelius .
 Now , I have no doubt that Messers Oldacre ... ... and Cornelius are one and the same person , the object being to change his name , draw on the money , and then vanish .



 We see before us a very deep , malicious and vindictive man .
 Did you know that he was once refused ... ... by McFarland 's mother ?
 All his life , he has longed for vengeance .
 If he could give the impression ... ... that he was murdered ... ... by the only child of his former sweetheart , what more better revenge ?
 I would never have allowed any real harm ... ... to befall poor Mr. McFarland ,
 I assure you . That 's for the jury to decide .
 You 're charging me ?
 For a joke ? It 's nothing more than a practical joke .
 It 's nothing less than murder ... ... the body in the fire .
 But whose body was it ?
 And old sailor , Le Strade , who had fallen upon hard times .
 When I examined the ashes of that fire ,
 I discovered that your experts had missed this .
 It is a tooth of the great white shark , and you see that it has been lightly carved .
 It is typical of the work carried out by seamen .
 Well , this isn 't evidence enough ... ... to show who died in the fire .

 I know for certain that on Monday , the day before the murder , a tramp called at this house .
 Yet , when I questioned the housekeeper , she assured me ... ... that no such tramp would ever be welcome .
 Not only was his reception welcoming , but the man received some of Oldacre 's clothing .
 Yesterday , near the front gate ,
 I found the calling card that he left , a coded sign advising his fellow travelers ... ... of a charitable welcome .

 And last night , with the help of your local Constable ,
 I talked to one of these fellow travelers , who said that the unfortunate seaman ... ... had been asked to call back the following day ... ... with the assurance of further hospitality .


 And so , the next morning , wearing his new clothes , or at least his new trousers , he returned ... ... and was never seen again .


 You 've saved an innocent man 's life , Mr. Holmes .
 You 've also saved me some embarrassment .
 Ah , my good chap .
 You will find that your reputation ... ... has been enormously enhanced .
 Just make a few alterations to that report ... ... which you are writing , and they will understand how hard it is ... ... to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Le Strade .



 You don 't want your name to appear ?
 Not at all .

 His work is its own reward .
 I 'll see you hang for this .
 That privilege must surely be mine .
