 [ Sighs ]

 Really ?
 He called me . For obvious reasons .
 Look , I 'm not here to rip him off .
 He has the stuff , right ?
 I need to know what you 're planning .
 What 's it matter to you ? I know they 're for Salamanca .
 Nitro pills .
 Your boss has heart problems .
 You already got it all figured out , why 're you asking ?
 How you gonna make the switch ?
 [ Sighs ]
 Hector keeps the pills in his coat pocket . When he hangs up his coat , I 'll make the switch .
 Mm .
 He goes down . Then what ?
 His heart goes out .
 That 's it .
 A lot of eyes on Salamanca .
 You do this , how are you gonna stop them from finding out it was you ?
 Are you tryin ' to tell me not to do this ?
 I 'm not tellin ' you anything .
 Just want to make sure you know what you 're getting into .
 I 'm not getting into anything . I 'm in it .
 I 've got no choice .
 [ Sighs ]
 Hector wants to use my dad 's business .
 My dad is a straight arrow .
 He won 't stand for it , which means he goes to the police , which means he 's a dead man .
 And that 's not happening .
 You get caught , it could get worse .
 You don 't think I know who I 'm dealing with ?
 No .
 I don 't .

 [ Gas cap rattling ]
 What are you doing ?
 [ Gas cap rattling ]
 [ Gas- cap door closes ]

 There are more people than the Salamancas to worry about here .
 Now , if you manage to pull this off without a bullet in your head and switch those pills , then switch 'em back .
 Switch them back ?
 Why ?
 Anyone gets an itch about the medicine not working , they 're gonna look at those pills .
 You do this ... switch 'em back .

 So ... you gonna let us make this deal ?
 You got the money ?
 Good .
 [ Sniffles ]
 Now , before we do this ...
 I 'm gonna need one more thing from you .

 - [ Indistinct conversations ] - _
 [ Intercom beeps ] Yes ?
 Okay .
 Miss Valco will see you now .
 - Oh .
 - Second door .

 [ Breathes sharply ]
 Hi there .
 Come on in . Yeah . Hi .
 I 've ... called quite a few times about an issue I 'm trying to address .
 Do you have your policy number ?
 No .
 [ Sighs ] Can you just look up my name ? McGill ?


 Charles McGill of Hamlin , Hamlin , McGill ?
 No , that 's my brother . Um ... [ Clears throat ]
 I 'm Jimmy . James McGill .
 Solo practitioner .
 Oh . There you are .
 Looks like you 're all paid up through the year .
 That 's sort of the issue .
 Long story short , through a series of unfortunate events , my license has been suspended .
 Yes , I see that here .
 Right . Well ...
 I was hoping I could get a refund for the time that I won 't be a lawyer .
 Now , that 's only fair , right ?
 I 'm sorry , Mr. McGill . It doesn 't work like that .
 We don 't refund for unused malpractice insurance .
 [ Sighs ]
 But it 's a ... it 's a lot of money for nothing .
 I understand it seems that way , but if one of your clients decides they want to bring a suit against you , this continues your coverage .

 [ Snaps fingers ] That 's the thing . My clients ?
 They love me .
 And they would never bring a suit against me .
 I 'm [ Chuckling ] extremely lovable . I can see that .
 But it 's company policy .
 [ Snaps fingers ]
 What about we put the insurance on hold ?
 And then , if someone were to try to sue me ... which they won 't ... then we just , uh , [ Clicks tongue ] kick that ol ' policy back into gear ?
 I understand your situation .
 I do .
 But there are rules preventing us from stopping and starting coverage .
 And I regret to inform you that ... when your license is reinstated next year , because of the suspension , your premiums are going to ... go up .
 Considerably .
 How considerably ? Um ... [ Drawer opens ]
 Looks like roughly ... 150 % .
 [ Breathing sharply ]
 [ Chuckling ]
 God .
 [ Sniffling ]
 [ Drawer closes ]
 Mr. McGill ?
 [ Sighs ]
 [ Sniffles ]
 Oh .
 I ...
 Mr. McGill , I 'm sorry .
 I wish we could help you , but we just can 't .
 [ Sniffles ]
 I 'm sorry . It 's hard .
 Very , very hard .
 [ Sniffles ]
 I 'm just having a rough time . I just need a break . [ Voice breaking ]
 Just one break .
 And I know you ...
 I know you can 't do anything , but ... [ Crying ]
 I 'm getting run out on this community service and ... getting ripped off left and right , and ... my car won 't start .
 [ Chuckles ]
 My gal is disappointed in me , and ... my brother ...
 [ Sniffles ]
 [ Crying ] My brother is sick !
 And he 's alone .

 I spent years caring for him , and ... now he hates me .
 He 's the only family I got left , and he hates me .
 He hates my guts . Is this your brother , Charles ?
 - Oh . - [ Sniffles ]
 And I pretend not to care , but he 's my brother .
 How can I not ?
 He 's mentally ill .
 He 's ... he 's holed up in a house with no electricity .
 He 's working by the light of gas lanterns .
 Wha ...
 He 's making mistakes with his clients .
 He 's ... mixin ' up numbers on important documents .
 He ... he ...
 He had a complete mental breakdown at the bar hearing .
 Your brother ... he had a breakdown in court ?
 It 's in the transcripts .
 [ Sobbing ]
 And I 'm worried , I 'm just ... if he screws up with one more big client ... it 's just gonna destroy him !
 God .
 [ Sniffles ]
 Oh , don 't ... don 't write ...
 What are you writing ?
 No , don 't write . I- I didn 't mean to say that .
 I don 't want him to get in trouble with you guys - 'cause of me .
 I ... - Right . I 'm sorry .
 I 'm gonna go .
 You 're not gonna do anything , are you ?
 I- I wouldn 't worry about it , Mr. McGill .
 Uh , please feel better .
 I 'm sorry .
 Just for ... uh , forget .
