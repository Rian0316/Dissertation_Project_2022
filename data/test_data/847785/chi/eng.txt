 A reporter just did a story on homeless teens -- my son is one of them .
 - Oh my God !

 Have I done stuff for ney that I 'm not proud of ?
 Yeah , sure .

 What could be more romantic ?
 - Could think of -- of something .


 Mike ?
 Aah !
 Aah !

 Code red !
 Code red !
 My friend just woke up from his coma .











 So you 're just gonna lie to people ?
 Oh , I 'm not talking about a lie -- just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where you 've been .
 I mean , we can 't possibly tell them that you 've been living on skid row , sleeping in a cardboard box .
 So why do I have to go to this history fair anyway ?
 I mean , it 's just some dumb school contest .
 We all know Danielle 's not gonna win .
 She never wins anything .
 - ( sighs ) is it weird eating off plates ?
 ' Cause if you were more comfortable , you could just Eat straight out of the garbage .
 - This is a family event , And we 're all gonna enjoy it together .
 Now , Danielle , stop sniping and start thinking of an alibi
 For your brother .
 - I know . We could say he joined a cult , And we had to kidnap and deprogram him .
 - Well , that would certainly Spare the family some embarrassment .
 Why not throw in a killing spree , too ?
 Well , here 's a thought -- We say he was at drama camp .
 It reflects Andrew 's interest in the performing arts , while giving us a private joke to savor about the drama of his estrangement .

 Uh , guys , why can 't we just tell the truth ?
 Uh , I got out of line , you kicked me out , I lived on the street , and I came back home .
 We 'll need a name for this drama camp .
 We got ties here , people !
 Designer ties , two for a dollar !
 Ooh , do you like those barbells ?
 Make me an offer . - I 'm feeling generous .
 Here 's the customer I 've been waiting for .
 ( man ) I 'll give you $5 for this .
 Carlos , I see you got my flier .
 - You 're having a garage sale featuring menswear and sporting equipment .
 I need cash , and you don 't expect me to sell stuff , do you ?
 Those are my good cuff links !
 Those are my CDs !
 Oh , my God , This is my baby blanket .
 My mam√° knitted this !
 And it pains me to sell it .
 It 's just that my lawyer told me What you 're offering for spousal support , And I can 't get by on that .
 Hey , I am doing the best that I can .
 I 've got a few deals in the pipeline , But I 'm not making near as much as I used to .
 - So I should be punished ?
 Attention , shoppers , for the next 20 minutes , free golf club with every purchase !
 Gaby , I 'm trying to be civil , But if you don 't knock it off right now , I swear , the gloves are coming off .
 Oh , honey , the gloves aren 't just off ...
 They 're 70 % off !
 Get your cashmere gloves !
 Hey , Parker , where 's your uniform ?
 You got your game in an hour .
 No , I don 't . I quit .
 What ?
 I hate baseball .
 Daddy said I don 't have to play it anymore .
 Well , Daddy should have checked with mommy , So she could have a chance to tell him why he 's wrong .
 Hey , you 're playing .
 - But , Mom , I suck !
 Everybody says so .
 That 's why they made up a fake position for me .
 - It is not fake .
 There is not a team I know that could get along Without their backup far right fielder .
 Okay , come on , Let 's go practice .
 All right , let 's try it again .
 Nice and easy .
 Watch the ball hit the bat . You ready ?
 You can do it . Here we go .
 Okay , Parker , I keep telling you , You gotta keep your eyes open .
 How are you gonna hit the ball when you 're doing this ?
 You threw it too fast .
 Throw slower .
 If I threw any slower , we would be bowling . Hey .
 Hey , whatcha guys doing ?
 I 'll tell you what we 're not doing -- quitting .
 Oh , hey , buddy , did you change your mind ?

 Lynette , I told him that he didn 't have to play anymore .
 He 's got five more games in the season .
 He made a commitment . he 's gonna see it through .
 - But , Lynette , he doesn 't like it , And if you haven 't noticed , he kind of sucks .
 - Yeah , well , that 's not the point .
 What kind of message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the going gets rough ?
 - Honey , it is kids ' baseball .
 It 's a way to kill three hours before they eat pizza .
 Why you being such a hard- ass ?
 - Well , it 's called parenting , Tom .
 Watch and learn .
 Okay , P- dog , This is a curveball .
 Again , opening the eyes -- can 't stress it enough .
 Are you sure it 's okay if we stay another day ?
 Well , let 's see .
 What excuse did we use when we had this conversation yesterday ?
 That we work hard , And we deserve to relax .
 No , I believe that was last Thursday 's rationale .
 Uh , fresh air is good for us ?
 - Ah , Tuesday .
 Okay , here 's one -- Julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father .
 Brilliant ! ( laughs )
 If we keep this up , We could stay here till Christmas . ( laughs )
 You know , some -- sometimes when you smile like that , That -- that -- that really makes me think that -- that ... What ?
 What were you gonna say ?
 Well , it makes me think that I could love you .
 I ... Don 't mean " love " In the swooning schoolboy sense --
 You know , fireworks exploding , Bells ringing .
 ( chuckles ) To me , it 's -- it 's about this -- A mundane task that -- that 's suddenly a joy because of who you 're doing it with .
 That 's love to me -- someone to fluff while you fold , someone to whisper to at a boring party , someone to -- to -- Shh .
 Do you mind ?
 You 're kind of drowning out the bells .
 So I am .
 I think I can feed myself now .
 Mm , you said that yesterday , And I wound up with a cleavage full of pudding .
 You heard the therapist .
 It 's gonna be weeks before you 're up and running .
 I just wanna get home , unpack .
 You just let home come to you , okay ?
 The whole street 's dying to see you .
 ( southern accent ) Bree is even bakin ' ya a peach pie .
 She 's the redhead , right ? ( normal voice ) right .

 Husband 's a doctor ...
 Rex .
 Rex is dead .
 Really ?
 When did that happen ?
 About a year and a half ago . What ?
 Yeah .
 You were at his funeral .
 What are you talking about ? That 's not possible .
 I just met him right before my accident .
 Mike ...
 What year is it ?
 2004 .
 Why ?
 It 's called retrograde memory loss .
 It 's caused by the swelling and frontal lobe damage .
 You say he 's lost two whole years ? Yeah .
 Is that unusual ?
 Ah , patients more typically lose several weeks .
 The damage may be more severe than we thought .
 Well , do you think he 'll get his memory back ?
 He might , At least partially .
 You could be of some assistance with that .
 How ?
 Bring him some personal belongings , Photos , letters .
 He 's gonna need some help to remember what he can 't .
 Oh , I 'm sure I could fill in a few blanks .
 Hey , did I tell you that , uh , Burnham fox is looking for a new creative director ? PR ?
 What makes you think I wanna work for a PR firm ?
 Easy hours , big paycheck , access to great parties ... Yeah , what was I thinking ?
 Honey , we agreed that I would chase my dreams ,
 And that ain 't it . Look , I was just making conversation .
 Batter up !
 - ( boy ) Is he up ?
 - ( boy ) Oh , come on !
 ( Lynette ) Come on , Parker ! Keep your eye on the ball !

 Strike one !
 Hey , people , he 's just a kid , okay ?
 Come on .

 Strike two !
 Hey , hey , That is not helpful .
 It only takes one , Parker ! Only takes one !
 - ( boy ) come on , Parker ! It 's not your son 's fault .
 He 's just up against the best pitcher in the league .
 Yeah , guy 's a machine . Who is that kid ? Nicky Abbott .
 He 's a neighbor of mine .
 The kid 's got an arm like a 13 year old .

 ( umpire ) Strike three !
 You 're out !
 I 'm gonna go buy him an ice cream .

 It 's okay , P- dog .
 You 're gonna get 'em the next inning !
 So tell me , what else do you know about this Nicky kid ? You 're short 50 cents .
 Please , that 's all I got .
 Hey , give the kid what he wants .

 Thanks .
 Hey , aren 't you , uh , Parker Scavo 's mom ?
 That 's right .
 Come .
 Walk with me .

 So ...
 Money 's a little tight , huh ?
 A little .
 Yeah , I heard your old man 's out of work .
 That 's gotta be tough . Yeah , they , uh , cut my allowance .
 No !
 A kid 's gotta have an allowance .
 How else you gonna buy the things you want , right ?
 Like that cotton candy .
 That 's a little piece of heaven , huh ?
 ( chuckles )
 Hey , I got an idea . Maybe we could help each other out .
 My son 's having a little trouble hitting the ball .
 Yeah , I saw that .
 Yeah .
 Ever seen one of these ?

 Carlos , What are you doing here ? I mean , besides lowering my property value .
 I had a little news ,
 And I wanted to see your face when I delivered it . - Oh .
 I 'm tired of fighting , so I called my lawyer and told him to give in to your demands for spousal support . Really ?
 Wow .
 Well , thank you .
 Okay , you 've seen my face .
 Now you can beat it . Wait . There 's more .
 Since I 'm gonna be giving you all that money ,
 I have to cut back on some stuff , like the rent on my apartment . But the good news is , according to my lawyer ,
 I 'm completely within my rights to do this ...
 Honey , I 'm home . Wait !
 You can 't stay here ! Now there 's the face that I was looking for .

 ( umpire ) Batter up !
 Strike one !
 Wow , that was kind of slow .
 His arm must be getting tired .
 Yeah , well , After all those fastballs ...
 Come on , Parker ! You can do it !

 Strike two !
 ( gasps ) Oh , my God !
 Yes !
 Mr. Faladi .
 Yes ?
 - I cannot thank you enough for getting Danielle interested in history .
 She has never worked so hard on a project before .
 ( chuckles ) Well , don 't tell anyone , but she is my favorite student .
 Oh , and it 's so good to see that Andrew 's back . Where 's he been all this time ?
 Drama camp -- a very prestigious drama camp .
 Do I know you ?
 Yeah , uh , you gave me a ride in your black sedan once .
 You know , the one with the reclining seats ? Excuse me .
 - Yeah .
 Wasn 't that Dr. Keck ? - You know him ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , we , uh ... ( chuckles ) Met at drama camp .
 Oh , good lord .
 You mean ... - Yeah .

 I , uh -- " performed " for him once .
 Are you all right ?
 - I 'll be all right .
 I 'm fine .
 Howard Keck ?
 You sure ?
 I mean , he 's a very respected member of the community .
 Yeah , well , they all were .
 What were you and Andrew talking about today at the fair ? Uh , nothing .

 I was gonna make some cocoa . Would you like some ?
 Orson , I saw the two of you whispering right after Dr. Keck ran off .
 What happened ?

 Look , Andrew asked me not to say anything , But I don 't want there to be any secrets between us ,
 So please don 't let him know I told you . Well , of course not .
 What is it ?
 How to put this ?
 Uh ...
 When Andrew was on the street , he , uh , he didn 't just beg for money . At times , he ...
 Well , he did things to earn it .
 Oh , good .
 I mean , I 'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all .
 Uh , what I mean is ... men hired him , uh , to ... uh , do things -- things he wasn 't very proud of .
 Yard work ?
 Afraid not .
 Orson , you 're scaring me .
 Did he do something awful ?
 No ! No .
 Not awful .
 I mean , people do it all the time .
 I do it with you . I just don 't pay you for it .

 I think someone could use a cocoa .
 Look , We mustn 't judge Andrew . He was desperate .
 I 'll never forgive myself .
 It 's all my fault for pushing him away .
 - Bree , don 't do that toourself .
 The important thing now is that he 's home and he 's safe .
 How does this Dr. Keck fit into all of this ?
 I mean , is he treating Andrew for some awful disease ? Actually , I think he was one of Andrew 's ...
 Clients . Howard Keck ? !
 Oh , that 's ridiculous .
 He 's got a wife and a daughter .
 He plays on Tom Scavo 's bowling team .
 - Well , that 's clearly not the only team he plays for .
 This is a nightmare , an absolute nightmare .
 Please don 't cut into that pie .
 I made it for Mike . Mike ?
 Delfino ? Yes .
 I left you two messages .
 Didn 't you check your voice mail ?
 He woke up from his coma .
 ( sighs )
 Who is it ?
 It is Sharla Banning ? I 'm not telling who it is .
 I 'm just asking the question .
 If you know a husband has been unfaithful , do you tell the wife ?
 - Absolutely .
 If he 's cheating , he could bring home a disease . - Okay , that 's what I was thinking .
 I mean , that 's how Bunny Connors got chlamydia .
 - ( gasps ) She told me she got it from wearing someone else 's bathing suit .
 - No , that 's how she got crabs .

 Poor bunny .
 It 's always something .
 If it 's not the clap , It 's a botched face- lift .
 ( laughs ) Be that as it may ,
 Do we all agree that I should tell this man 's wife ? - I wouldn 't .
 Women always say they wanna know if their husband 's cheating , and they always resent the person who tells them .
 So if Tom was cheating , you wouldn 't tell me ? - No !
 But I would hire someone to beat the crap out of him .
 Aw , you 're sweet . ( chuckles )

 Bree , I 'm sorry .
 I think you gotta follow your heart on this one , even if it isn 't the easiest thing to do .
 Gaby ...
 Are you and Carlos getting back together ?
 Why ?

 Uh ...
 Would you excuse me ? What are you doing ?
 I told you I was having friends over !
 I 'm thirsty !
 And this is my kitchen , too .
 Hey , ladies !
 Oh , for God sakes , put some pants on !
 - Well , I wanted to ,
 But somebody threw my laundry out of the dryer While it was still wet . - Don 't act like you didn 't deserve that .
 What are you talking about ?
 You peed in my shampoo .
 Admit it ! What ? ! Yeah , the cap was loose ,
 And I know how your sick mind works . - Oh , really ? Well , in that case , You should know that
 If I was gonna do something like that ,
 I wouldn 't do it to your shampoo .
 I would do it to your mouthwash , soup and decaffeinated coffee . Ladies .

 To answer your question --
 No , we are not getting back together .
 I love this music .
 What 's it about ?
 Making love , regret , cigarettes .
 Cigarettes ?
 That 's what I assume . It 's French .
 They write what they know .
 ( chuckles ) I 'd love to go to France someday .

 Would you like to go next month ?
 ( laughs ) are you serious ?
 Yeah , I 'm going on business . Come with me .
 Oh , Ian , I just took a week off .
 I couldn 't possibly justify taking another .
 Oh , you 'll manage .
 We 've already proven ourselves masters of the flimsy rationalization .
 Well ...
 Okay .
 You gotta promise me we 'll actually leave the hotel room .
 It 's Paris , dear .
 You can pretty much make love anywhere .
 Mmm .
 ( groans ) I thought you said you didn 't get reception up here . We , the occasional signal gets through .
 Please don 't answer .
 Oh , it 's Julie .
 I have to . Hello ? What 's up ?
 Hey .
 ( loudly ) Uh , I can 't --
 No , can you say that again ? The signal 's really bad .
 What ?
 Oh , my God .
 Is something wrong ?
 Mike woke up .
 Um , Julie , when -- when did he ...
 Julie ? Julie !
 ( cell phone beeps ) Oh , damn it !
 Oh , my God .
 Oh !
 Oh , my God !
 Um ... Uh , I- I ...
 I have to go .
 Um , I gotta get out of here .
 Yes , of course .
 Uh , I- I think that you 're sitting on my bra .

 What 'd the coach say ?
 What do you think he said ?
 Parker 's off the team .
 That 's not fair ! It 's not his fault !
 It doesn 't matter ,
 Because his mother bribed an 8- year- old pitcher , Who also , by the way , Was kicked off of his team .
 Not Nicky , too !
 What were you thinking ?
 I was trying to repair my son 's shattered self- esteem .
 With a $50 ?
 Yeah . Honey , everything would 've been fine
 If you had just let Parker quit . Well , excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter .
 Yeah , 'cause I guess having two in the family would be a bit much .
 Whoa . Where 'd that come from ?
 You say that you support my decision to leave advertising and follow my dream , but it is obvious to me that you resent it .
 - That is not true !
 Why do you keep dropping all these hints about the job at Burnham Fox then , huh ?
 - I just figured , since you 're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is , you might wanna make a few bucks in the meantime .
 I have a dream , too .
 It includes keeping this house .
 Oh , like I don 't --
 Are you fighting ?
 - No ! No .
 It was excitement , because we have just decided you don 't have to play baseball anymore .
 Ha !
 Isn 't that great ?
 But I can 't stop now .
 Huh ? - Not when I 'm finally getting good .

 You were right , Mom .
 I just needed a little more practice .
 So come on , come on ! Let 's go practice !
 See you outside .

 So what 's on the next page of your parenting handbook ?
 Ian , can you please hurry ?
 I am hurrying !
 - We should 've been on the road ten minutes ago . It 's not like checking out of a hotel .
 There 's doors to secure .
 I have to turn the gas valve off . - Can 't you do that stuff later ? When ?
 After the place is overrun by raccoons ?
 Of course , the joke would be on them when it blows up .
 Mike is awake !
 He 's lying there and he 's wondering where I am .
 Yes , I get it . You 're in a hurry .
 Just please give me a minute .
 I bet you 'd move faster If Jane were awake .

 Ah , here 's the picture that you took of me In my bikini at that pool party . You could 've warned me I was showing a little nip .
 Oh , Susan Mayer .
 Remember her ? Yeah .

 She 's pretty .
 Yeah , she is , sorta , In this picture .
 Is there a date on this thing ?
 The nurses said that she visited me a lot .
 We were close , huh ?
 You have just come out of a coma .
 Can we not talk about Susan till you start to regain your strength ?
 Why ?
 Oh , God .
 I hate to be the one telling you this ...
 Well , If you don 't want to --
 That tramp treated you like dirt .
 She strung you along .
 She slept with other guys . You broke up with her twice .
 Well , why did she keep visiting me when I was out of it ?
 Well , She 's a bit of a stalker .
 I was worried that she was gonna come in here and disconnect one of the tubes or something .
 But don 't worry .
 She 's glommed on to some new guy ,
 And she 's up in the mountains at his place with him right now . Wow .
 She told the nurses that she really loved me .
 That 's the one thing about Susan that you must never forget -- She is a liar .

 You waiting to see Mike Delfino ?
 Uh , yes . I 'm a ...
 I 'm a neighbor .
 But , uh , he already has a visitor , so I 'll come back later .
 Well , don 't be surprised if he doesn 't recognize you .
 He 's suffered significant memory loss .
 Really ?
 Oh , that 's too bad .
 You sure you don 't want to go in ?
 Ms. Britt 's here all the time . She won 't mind .
 No . I 've waited this long .
 I can wait a bit longer .
 Gaby !

 Hey , Carlos .
 What 's up ?
 My key won 't work .
 That 's probably because I had the locks changed .
 Gaby ! - Can 't be too safe .
 You never know when someone might move in on you when you 're not looking .

 Hello , 9- 1- 1 ?
 There 's an intruder breaking into my home .
 Can you tell them to come armed ?
 ( whispers ) I think he 's Mexican . I 'm telling you , I 'm her husband .
 I bought her this house . My name is on the deed
 Ma 'am , if you 're married , It 's a matter of public record .
 I can find out very quickly .

 All right , but we 're going through a very messy divorce , And he moved back in on me . And everyone knows the wife keeps the house ,
 And the husband gets the crappy apartment . It 's the American way . Call my lawyer .
 This is all totally legal , and s knows it .
 She 's just trying to get back at me .
 I hear that .
 You wouldn 't believe the stuff my wife pulled when we split .
 Whoa !
 Whoa , whoa , whoa , you can 't take sides !
 Police officers aren 't allowed to take sides .

 Ted , did you see that ? This lady just assaulted me .
 Oh .
 ( scoffs ) It was a swat . Ted , does this hurt ?


 Get your hands off me !
 Police brutality !

 This is all my fault .
 Why punish Parker ? Sorry , Mr ..
 Scavo . Rules are rules .
 I can 't put him back on the team .
 - Just one more game .
 He 'll suck , the other kids will taunt him , and he 'll wanna quit again .
 - See , everybody wins . I wish I could help , but ...
 Please ?
 You can 't bend the rules just once ?
 Did you know the team could use some new batting helmets ?
 Are you asking for a bribe ?
 You pretending you 're above that ?
 I 'll get my checkbook .
 Hello , Vera .
 I made you some of those , uh , Shortbread biscuits that you like so much .
 How sweet ! Can you stay for some tea ?
 It 's been so long .
 We have some catching up to do .
 Yes .
 Yes , we do .


 I know how painful this must be for you .
 It isn 't easy for me either ,
 Considering Andrew 's role in it . And why have you told me this ?
 Because I thought you 'd want to know .
 Why ?
 So you could do something .

 Do you think I 'm an idiot ?
 That I know nothing about the man I 've lived with for 27 years ?
 I 've always assumed Howard had some ... outlet ,
 A friend tucked away somewhere . I didn 't know . I didn 't care to know .

 But thank you for painting so vivid ,
 So indelible a picture of my husband 's activities . I 'm sorry . I just felt that if it were me , I --
 You 'd want to know .
 Yes , absolutely .
 Then I owe you an apology ,

 Because I 've been sitting on a little secret about your family . Oh ? Actually , it 's not much of a secret .
 My daughter tells me it 's common knowledge among the cheerleaders .
 - What is ?
 The fact that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher .

 But where are my manners ?
 I should have brought some biscuits with that .

 Well , aren 't we just the parents of the year ?
 Sitting in the stands , Waiting for our son to fail So we can weasel out of a bribery scandal .
 bribery scandals . Gotta count the batting helmets .

 Strike one !
 You know , for what it 's worth , I don 't think you 're a quitter . Good .
 And you don 't resent me ? No .
 ( umpire ) Ball one !
 Okay , well , maybe a little .
 Why ?
 You get to chase your dream while I get to spend the rest of my life in advertising .
 Strike two ! Maybe I 'd like to write a book Or , you know , start my own magazine .
 And then I think , " No , I can 't .
 I have a family to support , " And I am okay with that ... ( umpire ) Ball two ! - ... most of the time .
 You know what ?
 I 'm gonna look into that job at Burnham Fox .
 Don 't you dare !
 You are gonna chase your dream ,
 And I am gonna support you 99 % of the time .
 It 's all I could really ask for .

 How the hell did he do that ? !
 ( boy ) Yeah !
 Come on , come on !
 Crap , they 're cheering for him .
 Oh , he 's never gonna quit now !
 What are we gonna say to him ? ( boy ) Go , go , go , go !

 Ow ! Ow !
 I don 't know , buddy .
 Looks like a pretty bad sprain .
 Probably gonna be out the rest of the season .
 Damn . Hey , but you know what ?
 That was one heck of a hit .
 Sure was .

 I posted your bail .
 We can go .



 Oh , lighten up .
 You were in there for maybe an hour .
 The whole thing is funny , And you know it .

 Come on , Gaby !
 We 've been going at each other for months now .
 Can we just stop ?
 You know as well as I do we 're gonna end up back together .

 No , what 's crazy is throwing away the past three years .
 I mean , Why can 't we just say
 What we really feel for a change ?
 Fine , I 'll get the ball rolling .
 I still love you .
 That 's too bad , because I don 't love you . ( laughs ) yeah , right .

 I don 't ...
 And I haven 't for a very long time .
 That 's a lie .
 You 're just saying that to hurt me . No , if I wanted hurt you ,
 I would tell you about last weekend ...

 When I slept with John Rowland .

 ( Gabrielle ) Carlos , what are you doing ?
 Carlos !
 What are you doing ? !
 Carlos !
 You can 't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere !
 Ah
 Carlos !

 Danielle , he is your history teacher , and he is 35 years old !
 ( Bree ) Danielle !
 Robert says age is just a number . - Don 't you dare leave this house ! You can 't break us up !
 I love him , and he loves me !


 Come on , Mom .
 I am so tired of feeling like the worst mother who ever lived .
 You 're not . There 's Grandma .

 I 've done the best I could to teach you kids right from wrong .
 I just -- I 've tried so hard to set a good example .
 Why isn 't it taking ? It took .
 I mean , we know the difference between right and wrong .
 We just chose " wrong . "
 Why ?
 Sometimes when you push a kid really hard to go one way , the other way starts to look more entertaining .
 You 're awful . Yeah , I know . I blame shoddy parenting .



 You know , we never discussed
 What it was like for you while you were ... away . I just want you to know , if you ever wanna talk about it , there 's nothing you can 't tell me .

 Um ... thanks .
 Not right now . Okay ?


 I 'll pick up my bags later .
 It 's not my fault you weren 't there . What ?
 - It 's not .
 I know what you 're feeling , but --
 How could you possibly know what I was feeling ?
 For six months , I have prayed every day
 For that man to wake up , And you made me give up on him .
 I did not make you . - Okay , not on purpose , but you did . You were sweet and charming and English ,
 And that 's why when my prayers were answered ,
 I was a hundred miles away , naked in someone else 's arms .
 should never have happened .
 You can say what you want about this , say that you feel guilty , say that it was bad timing , but -- but don 't you say that this should never have happened !
 Because you 're the -- you 're the best thing that 's happened to me in years .
 Ian , I 'm -- I 'm sorry .
 I know how you feel . It 's Mike .
 It 's my Mike .


 Well , then -- Then you should go .

 Thank you .

 Oh , my God .
 You awake .
 Hi , Susan . Oh , God !
 It 's so wonderful to hear your voice again .
 They say you 've been here a lot .
 Yes ! Yes , I have . Almost every day .
 I can 't tell you how much I 'm kicking myself for not being here when you woke up .
 Where were you ? I was in the country .

 But I 'm back now .
 ( chuckles )
 Okay .

 Is something wrong ? You ...
 You don 't seem happy to see me .

 To be honest , I don 't remember you .
 What ? I remember moving to Fairview and meeting people ,
 But after that , nothing .
 The doctors say it 's the head trauma . Oh .
 But you 're gonna be all right . ( chuckles )
 And I 'm gonna help you remember .
 And if you don 't mind , I 'm kind of tired now .
 Oh . Okay .
 ( laughs )
 Right , you -- you , um , you sleep .
 I 'll come back tomorrow .
 I 'd rather you didn 't .

 Well , I 've got therapy .
 Maybe next week .


 Okay .



 Drama camp was awesome . Uh , we 're talking zero supervision .

 So you can tell Carlos that he can have the photo albums . She says that they hold no sentimental value for her .

 I don 't know how these rumors get started . No , Parker only quit the team ' cause he hurt his ankle .


 And poor Howard has to work late again tonight . Of course , He does it all for the family .


 You say I dated Susan for a long time .
 Do you think I was in love with her ?

 I don 't . I really ...
 Really don 't .
