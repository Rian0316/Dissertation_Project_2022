 JlMMY : What 's so funny ?
 Eh . Ah , you wouldn 't get it .
 - Okay . - Okay .
 Here 's what you 're gonna do .
 You 're gonna take , uh , 25 South to Las Cruces . You can pick up 10 West from there .
 Hey , write this down , man ... Uh , 10 West at Las Cruces .
 A little past Deming , there 's a state road . It 's 146 .
 Uh , follow the signs to Antelope Wells until Mile Marker 223 .
 Turn off at the dirt road and take it 30 miles south . 30 miles down a dirt road ?
 Fewer eyes out in the desert , you know ? [ CLlCKS TONGUE ]
 Actually , it 's 31 . 6 , so make sure that you use the little , uh , you know , trip- meter thing on the odometer or whatever .
 Anyway , once you get there , you 're gonna see a well .
 It 's really old , you know , broken down . Uh , what does this well look like ?
 It looks like a well .
 It 's the only one out there .
 And can you see it from the road ? [ CHUCKLlNG ] Yeah , you 'll see it ... don 't worry about it .
 My cousins are gonna meet you there with the money , 9 : 00 a . m .
 You 'll like them . They 're good boys . [ SlGHS ]
 I 'll bet . Um . [ CLlCKS TONGUE ]
 Hey , I have an idea ... why not have these cousins of yours bring the money just all the way here ?
 Cut out the middle man .
 Yeah , see , the thing is , this whole thing has to be very , uh , low profile , you know ? [ BREATHES SHARPLY ]
 There are people ... let 's say competitors of mine ... people who want to keep me in here .
 And so , you know , my cousins come into town ... those people will notice .
 What about Nacho Varga , right ? Would your " competitors " notice him ?
 He seems like he 's got a pretty good head on his shoulders .
 Ignacio ?
 Yeah , sure , I mean , he 's good for a lot of things .
 But with $7 million ? [ SCOFFS ]

 You 're a friend of the cartel .
 Is that it ?
 Not exactly .

 You got him bail ?
 Some evidence fell into my lap . I was kind of obligated to use it , you know , for my client .
 [ SlGHS ] When you said you couldn 't do it ,
 I knew you 'd find a way . [ CLlCKS TONGUE , BREATHES SHARPLY ]
 There 's a complication .
 Remember that time you had a P. D. case with the kid whose parents kicked him out because he got caught with a joint ?
 Yeah .
 And you ... you had to drive all the way out to the uncle 's house ... I think it was in Moriarty ... to pick up the bail ?
 - Well ... - Wait , what ? So , what ... you 're saying
 - you 're gonna pick up Salamanca 's bail ?
 - Yeah . Only it 's a little further than Moriarty and a little more money .
 How much ? Seven .
 - Seven thousand ? - Million . $7 million ?
 [ CHUCKLlNG ] Yeah .
 You 're going to pick up $7 million of cartel money ?
 I know what you 're thinking , but it 's safe .
 Completely . And it 's just a quick drive down by the border .
 - I 'll be right back . - The border ?
 Jimmy , you are an attorney , not a bagman .
 There 's no amount of money that is worth this .
 - Can 't his people do it ? - He trusts me .
 I 'm his attorney . That 's it .
 You 're making a bigger deal out of this - than you need to . - What ? !
 - You 're gonna ... - I will pick it up in the morning , I will be done , and I 'll be home before you will .
 Okay . Then I 'm going with you .
 [ SCOFFS ] Well , they 're only expecting me .
 You know , one guy . I mean , that 's kind of the whole point ... you know , security through obscurity .
 - Jimmy , this is insane . - I don 't e ...
 No , listen , it 's just little ol ' me in my little ol ' Suzuki Esteem .
 And there has never been more than 50 bucks in an Esteem in the history of Esteems .
 - So , no one 's gonna look at me twice . - [ SlGHS ] You sound like you are talking yourself into this .
 I will be okay . I swear .
 If I smell even the faintest whiff of anything wrong ,
 I 'll be out of there like a shot .
 I don 't like this .
 I don 't want you to do it .
