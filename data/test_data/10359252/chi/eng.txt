 00 : 00 : 08, 036 -- > 00 : 00 : 09, 984 Previously on Why Women Kill ... I have a date . With your married man .
 It 's at this really fancy nightclub .
 He 's taking you out .
 In public .
 I thought Rob was taking her to the club tonight .
 Do you honestly think I 'm going to let that happen ?
 Listen , when you were in my office earlier , did you happen to move any papers ?
 I know better than to touch your things .
 I 'll have to stay late and redo it .

 Rob canceled on me .
 I love music .
 - I used to play the piano . - Do you still play ?
 My husband ... didn 't care for my playing .
 Oh , honey . Your husband 's dead .
 Don 't you think it 's time you stopped listening to him ?
 Honey !
 Maybe when Mr. Grove moves out , we could start doing this in your bed .
 He won 't be leaving until after my daughter 's wedding .
 Well , it ... Whoa , whoa , whoa .
 That 's two months away .
 She gave me her hand in marriage .
 - Karl ... - And I 'm never going to let it go .
 Oh !
 Bloody hell !
 I got fired .
 I 'm not surprised .
 - Simone ...
 - One day , I will divorce Karl , but I will never hate him .
 Where does that leave me ?
 In the back of a van , having a marvelous time .
 Van came with the job , so ...
 We 'll figure it out .
 I 'm not worried about Duke anymore .
 He stopped texting me .
 So what 's his deal ?
 - Is he crazy ? - A little .
 He was always accusing me of cheating on him .
 Come with us to Venice tomorrow .
 - Oh , my God ! - Tomorrow ? Really ?
 Are you going to Venice ? I don 't know yet .
 I asked you , before , if you were in love with her .
 Jade is the only thing in my life that is easy .
 Live with us .
 Be with us .
 You just got home .

 The purpose of an autopsy is to provide clarity .
 How did the victim die ?
 Was death the result of a gunshot ?
 Stabbing ?
 Poison ?
 How someone is killed is easy to understand .
 Why it happened , that 's never so simple .
 But it always begins with a choice .
 It might be a decision to conduct a tawdry affair .
 A plan to keep secrets from a loved one .
 Or an agreement to bring a stranger into your bed .
 Yes . People make all sorts of questionable choices .
 Of course , that 's what keeps me in business .
 Our waitress is giving me odd looks .
 You 're wearing sunglasses indoors , at night .
 I think she recognizes me .
 I don 't even recognize you and we 've had sex ten times .
 - Lower your voice . - Relax .
 Nobody here recognizes you .
 Let me see your eyes .
 So , I got you a present .
 Jewelry ?
 You shouldn 't have .
 It 's called a Swatch .
 And ... it 's waterproof .
 Oh , so it 's safe from my tears of joy .
 I wanted to do something special .
 It 's our first date .
 I mean , outside of the van .
 I 'm not sure I 'd call it a date .
 Why not ? We 're at a table , and there 's food .
 I wouldn 't call it food , either .
 You don 't make it very easy to be your boyfriend .
 Boyfriend ?
 Ah , another word you don 't like .
 It 's just not how I would describe you .
 What would you call me , then ?
 Your ... lover ? Why do you need a job title ?
 What 's wrong with " Tommy " ?
 Are you gonna put it on ?
 Why would I do that ?
 Because it 's a gift , and I 'm asking you to .
 Oh , for God 's sake .
 What 's wrong ?
 Am I embarrassing you ?
 Shh .
 Shush . Sit down .
 Oh , I 'm sorry .
 Next time , I 'll buy you a gift that you 'll actually wear on a date with me ,
 like a ski mask .
 Tommy .
 Uh , what did I do now ?
 Can I get you anything else to eat ?
 Oh , God , no . The food is dreadful here .
 And he 's too young for you , while we 're offering unsolicited opinions .
 Sheila . What can I do for you ?
 I have no food in my house , and my kids are starting to make some real ugly threats .
 Maybe I can find a jar of peanut butter .
 That 's more than they deserve .
 What 's with the skates ?
 They 're cute , huh ?
 Rob bought them for me on our first date .
 He took me to Happytime Roller Rink .
 So why are you digging them up now ?
 I 'm going skating later today , with April .
 - The waitress ? - Oh , yes .
 Last week , we went to an Andy Warhol exhibit .
 Next week , she 's going to teach me to surf .
 Can you imagine ? Me , surfing ?
 I thought the plan was to gain the girl 's trust and convince her to end the affair .
 That 's what I 'm doing .
 You sure ?
 ' Cause it sounds like the two of you are becoming close .
 Well , maybe a little .
 April is very sweet .
 She 's so free- spirited .
 You wouldn 't believe the fun we have together .
 Mm- hmm . She sounds nice .
 For a girl who 's sleeping with your husband .
 I know it 's odd , but I like her .
 I can 't help it .
 What 's wrong with her being a friend ?
 Nothing .
 As long as you don 't forget she 's also the enemy .
 Well , how about , uh , you know , classic " she 's our lover " ?
 Okay .
 Oof . That is too sexual .
 Yeah ? All right . Um , our " special friend " ?
 That makes me sound slow .
 All right . Uh , she 's the third prong of our throuple .
 Ugh . Barf .
 Well , now that Jade 's gonna live with us , we got to have some way to introduce her .
 Well , why don 't we just say she 's family ?
 - Aww . I love that . - Yeah .
 That 's nice .
 Wait .
 Jade , does that look like Duke 's truck to you ?
 Oh , shit .
 Wait , like , like , scary ex Duke ?
 Did you tell him you were staying here ?
 No . I didn 't tell anyone .
 Oh , God . He 's getting out the car .
 - Oh , fuck , fuck , fuck , fuck , fuck ...
 - Okay , it 's okay , it 's okay .
 Okay , all right , all right .
 Look . Don 't worry . It 's gonna be okay .
 - I got this . - Wait , what do you mean , you got this ?
 I 'm gonna talk to him . You know ?
 - Man to man . - No .
 Eli ... No ... don 't ...
 E ...
 Oh , that 's not good . Okay .
 Can I help you ?
 Yeah , I 'm looking for my girlfriend .
 A guy told me that she 's staying here . Oh .
 Uh , who 's your girlfriend ?
 Jade .
 Jade .
 Jade , Jade , Jade , Jade , Jade , Jade , Jade ... - No ... Jade who ?
 - She 's in that window , man .
 - Oh , Jade . Right . Yeah .
 - Yeah . - I need to talk to her . - Oh , okay .
 Well , uh , the thing is , she 's not really available right now , so ...
 - Yeah , I think she is .
 - Yep .
 Oh , shit .
 All right , look ... look , man .
 I don 't want to get physical with you , okay ?
 You 're right . You don 't .
 What do you think you 're doing ?
 You must be the fuck buddy .
 And you must be Duke , the two- time felon .
 Those were both felonies , right ?
 So if I were to call the cops and they came here to see you committing a third assault , that sounds like three strikes to me .
 This is the part where you walk away to avoid going to prison .
 Tell Jade I 'll be in touch .
 You know , that was unnecessary .
 I had it under control .
 - Honey , it was a team effort . - I know .
 Thank you so much .
 I was so freaked out .
 Aww .
 Oh ...
 You 're my hero .
 Jade , I 'm not your hero .
 I just , I 'm ... want to make sure you 're okay .
 Ooh , we should invite the Prescotts to the wedding .
 Must we ?
 Well , I can 't stand them , either , but they spent $10, 000 at the gallery last year .
 Just put them on the maybe list .
 Another maybe ? Amy will be here in an hour .
 We promised we 'd have the guest list done .
 What about the ... Randalls ?
 Absolutely not . I despise them .
 Since when ?
 We went to their son 's wedding a month ago .
 And never got a thank you note for the candy dish .
 - That 's awfully petty . - I agree .
 How hard is it to write a simple note ?
 I meant you .
 What is going on ?
 What do you mean , " going on " ?
 You 've been in a foul mood ever since you came home last night .
 What could it be ?
 I broke a nail ? No , that 's not it .
 My husband sleeps with men ?
 No , couldn 't be that .
 Fine . Don 't tell me .
 Look , we have prepaid the caterer for 400 guests .
 If we don 't finish our list , then Brad 's family will invite more rubes from Oklahoma , and the entire wedding will turn into a hoedown .
 Do they have hoedowns in Oklahoma ?
 Oh , well , they do in the musical .
 First number of act two .

 How did I not know what I was getting with you ?
 What ?
 Oh , Amy , you 're early .
 We haven 't quite finished the guest list yet .
 Brad slept with his ex- girlfriend .
 The wedding 's off . I require wine .
 Watch out , watch ou ... watch out !
 That was a blast .
 Can I just say , every day I spend with you feels like an adventure .
 We do have fun together , don 't we ?
 To be honest ,
 I 've been feeling a little lonely in L. A.
 I know how you feel .
 It 's nice to have a real girlfriend out here .
 Well , it 's getting late . I should go .
 Wait , do you think you have time for one more adventure tonight ?
 - I suppose . - Okay .
 April ?
 What are you up to ?
 Go ahead . Try one .
 Brownies ? How are they an adventure ?
 My recipe calls for a special ingredient .
 Like what ? Grass .
 From your lawn ?
 No , I 'm talking about pot .
 You know , marijuana ?
 You mean reefer ?
 Oh .
 Look , it 's not a big deal .
 Lots of people do it .
 Criminals . Musicians .
 - Please don 't be angry .
 - You are a good girl . How could you do such a thing ?
 Rob wanted to .
 Your married man ?
 Yeah .
 That stuns me .
 Given how you 've described him .
 He can be such a square .
 I think he was just looking for a way to cut loose .
 Oh .
 Look , I really didn 't mean to offend you .
 I 'm fine . It 's just something I ... wasn 't expecting .
 So are we friends again ?
 Great . I 'll go put these away .
 - Wait . - Hmm ?
 Oh , what the heck .
 But how did you find out ?
 I 've had my suspicions for a while , and then Brad finally admitted that he 's been lying to me about Cindy the whole time we 've been engaged .
 I know so many whores named Cindy .
 And did I mention she 's fat ? 140 pounds if she 's an ounce .
 Oh , 140 , where did he find her , a carnival ?
 You know , darling , it 's not even noon yet .
 My fianc√© fucked a beluga whale .
 Can I please get some support here ?
 I 'm sorry .
 Uh ... So he 's been sleeping with Cindy this whole time ?
 No , I didn 't say that .
 I 'm confused .
 He 's been lying the whole time .
 They hooked up that weekend you took me to Hawaii .
 Hang on , that was two years ago .
 Were you and Brad even engaged yet ?
 No , but we were together .
 Mm , off and on .
 Okay , Brad hadn 't proposed yet , but we both knew he was going to .
 Exactly .
 Yeah , or at least I knew .
 Well , maybe you should 've told him .
 I can 't believe you 're taking Brad 's side .
 I 'm just saying the situation is not quite so cut and dried .
 Brad is a good man . You might consider forgiveness .
 Forgiveness ?
 Boy , did you marry into the wrong family .
 I 'm going to my room .
 Darling , I know you 're upset , but when you drink without a glass , Brad wins .
 Mmm .
 I don 't think it 's working .
 Takes a while to kick in .
 I hope I recognize the sensation .
 I 'd hate to be high and miss it .
 Trust me , you 'll know .
 Hey , want to order in Chinese food and listen to records ?
 Aren 't you having dinner with your married man tonight ?
 That 's tomorrow . Tonight , Rob has plans with his wife .
 What ?
 I don 't know . It 's been planned for weeks .
 Some dinner party with his boss .
 Wednesday !
 Today is Wednesday .
 Yeah . Why ?
 I was supposed to feed my neighbor 's cat on Monday .
 Oh !
 Poor Mittens .
 I should go .
 Damn it ! Where 's my other skate ?
 - It 's under your armpit . - Oh , yes .
 Well , thank you for the reefer .
 Yeah .
 Where have you been ?
 We need to leave in five minutes .
 I know , I know .
 Were you roller skating ?
 Whoa .
 Come on . We have to go now .
 Let 's go over a few things .
 When he 's out of the office , my boss likes to be called Hal .
 His wife is Vivian .
 Vivian .
 Dale and Gretchen Clark will be there .
 He 's tall . She 's brunette .
 Pamela and Joe , they 'll be the old ones .
 And Myron Paul is coming , he 'll be the short one .
 Myron is short .
 The guest of honor is Mr. Tashiro from Japan .
 Should be obvious who he is .
 Why ?
 Is that a joke ?
 Sure .
 Duke , please , I 've apologized , like , 20 times .
 What ? Please , I 'm begging you , please , don 't hurt her .

 Duke ! Duke , please .
 What is wrong with you ?
 She 's just a baby !
 Duke !
 Hello ?
 Oh , my God . Jade , what 's going on ?
 Duke is gonna kill Teacup .
 - Teacup ?
 - Our dog .
 He says if I don 't meet with him , he 's gonna put her down .
 Holy shit .
 He can 't do that , right ? Legally ?
 I 'm honestly not sure .
 You don 't think he 'd hurt his own dog , do you ?
 He went to prison for choking his accountant .
 My dad 's an accountant .
 I have to go over there .
 I love that dog .
 Jade , it 's too dangerous .
 I don 't care . I have to save Teacup .
 Fine , fine , but you 're not going alone .
 I will go with you , okay ?
 - Okay .
 Thank you . - Okay . - Thank you .
 - Yes , of course .
 Whoa , whoa .
 What about me ?
 I- I 'm just saying , you know , two 's good , three 's better , right ?
 Yeah . Okay .
 All right .
 Oh .
 If that 's Brad , I 'm not here .
 Hello ? Ah , good morning , Brad .
 I 'm not here !
 Yes , actually , Amy 's ...
 Okay , yes , you heard that .
 Good !
 Look , I- I really couldn 't say , Brad .
 I mean , you know women .
 Oh , I know .
 Tell me about it .
 Stop talking to him .
 Oh , no , if anything , worse .
 - No , I know it 's ridiculous , but ...
 - Give me that .
 Right , well , uh , I 'm off to the gallery .
 I 'd love to start the day with a kiss .
 Mm .
 Ask the gardener .
 - Oh , I won 't make that mistake twice .
 - Hmm .
 - Tommy !
 - I was up all night , thinking about our date , and I- I was super upset , but I should not have walked out , and I am sorry .
 Are you crazy ?
 You can 't come to my house with flowers .
 I waited for Karl to leave .
 Well , he 's not the only one who could see you .
 - You have to go now . - But , wait , at least take the flowers .
 - No ! - If you won 't accept a simple gift , then what does that say about our future ?

 We have no future . - Are you breaking up with me ?
 - Yes , it 's over .
 Now go .
 Tommy Harte ?
 Amy ?
 I haven 't seen you since last Christmas .
 Yes , it 's been a while .
 Hi . So who are the flowers for ?
 They 're for you , of course .
 For me ? How did you know I was here ?
 What a good question .
 Well , I called Naomi to tell her the wedding was off , and she shared the bad news with Tommy , and then he brought you this lovely bouquet .

 That 's so sweet .
 You 're welcome .
 Tommy , you should really go .
 Amy and I have million things to do today .
 I 'll just put these in your room .
 Well , it was very nice to see you , Amy .
 Tommy , are you free tonight ?
 I don 't know if you 're seeing anyone these days , but I could really use some cheering up .
 Well , I was seeing someone , but , uh , she recently broke up with me .
 Amy ! You can 't go out tonight .
 We have to let people know the wedding 's off .
 So there are calls to make .
 I 'll make them tomorrow .
 So I 'll see you at Herberto 's , 7 : 00 ?
 We can console each other .
 That 'll be nice .
 Goodbye , Mrs. Grove .
 Amy , what could you possibly be thinking ?
 Well , I 'm thinking I 'm going to have revenge sex with Tommy Harte .
 Well , uh ... you can 't do that .
 He 's not even your type .
 I know he 's a little young , but he 's gotta learn from someone .
 So you 're- you 're telling me that this took four hours ?
 Well , yes .
 - That 's very impressive .
 - That was the quick version .
 Oh , there they are . Hey .
 We were just about to send out a search party .
 So sorry . It takes Beth Ann a while to get dressed . Yes .
 So I recall .
 This is my wife , Vivian .
 It is so lovely to meet you , Beth Ann .
 And I want to introduce you to Gretchen and Dale Clarkson ,
 - and Pamela and Joe Kensington . - Hi .
 Where 's Myron ?
 - Oh , Myron had to cancel - Oh .
 Oh , here 's our guest of honor .
 This is the young executive I was telling you about .
 - Robert Stanton . - Sir , it 's an honor .
 I 've heard a lot of wonderful things about your work .
 I hope I live up to your expectation .
 So Myron 's not here ?
 Uh , no .
 Dinner is served .
 - Shall we ? - Thank goodness . Yes .
 Thank you . I 'm starving .
 What is your name ?
 Beth Ann .
 You must be Tashiro .
 I am .
 You were right .
 It was obvious .
 I made place cards for everyone .
 Uh , Mr. Tashiro , you 'll be right here in the center .
 Thank you .
 Um , Beth Ann , did you find your place card ?
 Honey ?
 Sorry , I was looking at the swan .
 Do you like it ?
 It 's the most amazing thing I 've ever seen .
 That is so sweet of you to notice .
 Most don 't .
 Rob , do you see this ?
 It 's very pretty .
 Now put it on your lap .
 Oh , I don 't want to unfold it , it took too much work .
 It 's fine , Beth Ann , I 'm , uh ...
 I 'm sure it 's not that difficult .
 How would you know ?
 Sweetie , don 't you , uh , do this at all our dinner parties ?
 Well , do you think that makes it easy ?
 I 'm sure I could do it if I tried .
 I bet you couldn 't !
 That sounds like a challenge .
 No , no , she 's not challenging you .
 Make a swan . I dare you .
 Well ...
 She 's feisty . You 're on .
 Oh , well , this should be very interesting .
 Oh , piece of cake . Come on . How would I begin ?
 I think you 've got to lay it flat to start .
 Brilliant .
 The- the- the trick is in the first fold , am- am I right ?
 - Well , I 'm not helping you . - Great .
 Wait , wait , wait . Almost ...
 Got it .
 Keep your day job .
 Not so easy , is it ?
 All right , I 'm gonna get it this time .
 Honey , I dropped my fork on the floor .
 Would you get it for me ?
 Sure .
 What is wrong with you ? Huh ?
 You 're acting like you 're drunk .
 Am I ?
 That might be the pot .
 Pot ?
 That means marijuana .
 I had some before dinner .
 Where in God 's name did you get marijuana ?
 What 's wrong ?
 Am I not allowed to cut loose ?
 We will talk about this later . Good .
 Then you can tell me where you get your marijuana .
 What ?
 That 's right .
 I know what you 've been up to .
 All right .
 - It 's impossible .
 I give up . - Oh .
 Here , here . Let me help you .
 Thank you , my dear .
 It 's more like a duck .
 This is it .
 Duke 's place is just down the pathway .
 Okay ...
 let 's do this .
 Okay , why are you talking like that ?
 Like what ?
 Like the star of a low- budget action film .
 What ? I 'm not doing that .
 All right , let 's stay close , people .
 Here we are .
 - What 's the plan ?
 - Okay , so I 'm gonna knock on the door .
 When Duke answers , I 'll confront him ...
 No confronting . Duke is a violent felon .
 Are you crazy ?
 You brought a hammer ?
 I prefer to call this " Plan B. "
 That 's your plan B , aggravated assault ?
 It 's not assault if he hits me first .
 Oh , he will definitely hit you first .
 Great , great , anyway , so while we 're struggling , Jade 's gonna rush in , she 's gonna grab the dog , and then we run .
 Honey , that is a stupid plan .
 That 's a bit harsh , but , okay , fine , you go .
 Here 's my plan :
 Duke opens the door and I write him a massive check for the dog .
 Oh , that 's good . Duke is always broke .
 I mean , if you want to be the kind of person that just solves all of her problems with money .
 Fine .
 I very much do .
 Jade , go ahead .
 Duke !
 Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God , it 's Teacup .
 Honey , honey , it 's okay .
 Mommy 's here .
 I guess Duke 's not home .
 No , no , no . No , no , no .
 He 's definitely , definitely home .
 He doesn 't go to work till 5 : 00 .
 Alright . Come on , Duke , open up .
 Okay .
 He 's clearly not home . You know what ?
 We 'll just write him a note and we 'll say that you came by and you are willing to make him a generous offer to buy the dog .
 W- What , w- we 're just gonna leave her here ?
 For now , yeah .
 Okay , I left my pen in the car . Hold on .
 I don 't like this .
 I know , but , I mean , what else can we do ?
 You don 't understand , if something happens to my dog ,
 I will fucking lose my mind .
 - Okay , okay , okay , okay , okay . - Please , please , please .
 Start the car !
 What ? Oh , shit .
 Start the car now .
 Jade !
 You bitch !
 You 're fucking dead !
 Mom , have you seen my car keys ?
 I 'm gonna be late to meet Tommy .
 Sorry .
 I could 've sworn they were in my jacket .
 What the hell ?
 I 'm going on a date and you 're inviting Aunt Kay to the wedding ?
 That makes no sense .
 I know she 's dull , but she 's good for a gravy boat at least .
 I 'm not getting married .
 Okay ? I 'm going to meet Tommy Harte for sex , if I ever find my damn keys .

 Yes , dear . If .
 Did you hide my keys ?
 Yes .
 And once you 've calmed down , you 'll thank me . Sit .
 No ! Where are my keys ?
 They 're not in my purse .
 I told you they weren 't in there .
 Fine , keep the keys . I 'll walk .
 In those heels , you won 't make it past the driveway .
 I know you 're upset , but if you sleep with Tommy , you 're slamming the door on Brad forever .
 I know . That 's the point .
 But you love him , and he loves you .
 The hall 's booked , the caterer 's been paid , your dress is gorgeous .
 Why are you on Brad 's side ? What 's changed ?
 Who got to you ?
 Hello . Was it him ?
 It was you . This is all your fault .
 Yes , I 'm sure it is . Sorry , what are we talking about ?
 Amy 's decided to pay Brad back by seducing Tommy Harte .
 Tommy ? Isn 't he a little young for you ?
 What is he , 17 ?
 He 's 18 and mature for his age .
 But that 's beside the point .
 You made a promise , young lady , to Brad , to us , and to the Biltmore Hotel .
 Oh , you 're one to talk about promises .
 You divorced Daddy , the guy after him , and now with Karl sleeping in the guest room , I 'm assuming he 's on his way out as well .
 Look .
 I love Brad , but I don 't know if I can trust him , and I don 't want to be another you .
 With three husbands by 40 .
 Your keys are in the freezer .
 Go .
 A- Amy , Amy . You 're right .
 Your mother and I are sorting through some issues , and I 'm not a perfect husband , and maybe Brad won 't be either , but love is always a risk , and I know it 's easy to think this is never going to last , so why don 't I end it now , but ... the chance for love doesn 't come around every day .




 One must think long and hard before one casts it aside .
 Mm .
 Tommy 's waiting .
 Oh , go , go . I ...
 I hope you have a nice dinner .
 Do you , uh ... think my pretty speech helped ?
 More than you know .
 I need to make a phone call .
 My baby .
 I 'm gonna take Teacup upstairs . It 's nice and quiet up there .
 Yeah . She 's had a stressful day .
 What you did today , that was the nicest thing that anyone 's ever done for me .
 - Oh . No big deal . - No .
 It absolutely was .
 - Ow !
 - Oh ...
 Son of a bitch .
 Please hide this . Somewhere he can 't find it .
 Okay . Thanks .
 Come on , Teacup .
 Oh , that 's a good girl .
 It 's a good day , huh ?
 Is it ?
 I mean , we got the dog back , didn 't we ?
 All right . I know we might 've broken the law a little bit .
 You broke the law , a lot .
 And you made me an accomplice .
 All right , yeah , but you saw how happy it made Jade , right ?
 - I think it was worth it . - Absolutely , you 're right .
 The smile on Jade 's face more than makes up for the fact that I could be disbarred .
 I 'm sorry . I mean , I had to do something .
 No , you didn 't . I had a plan .
 Yeah ? So did I.
 Mine actually worked .
 That 's not the point .
 Oh , no , no , no , no . The point is that I finally do something right and you can 't even be happy about it .

 What am I supposed to be happy about ?
 For the last two years , I 've been pathetic Eli who- who can 't finish a screenplay , who can 't help pay the bills .
 I- I get it .
 You 're frustrated with me . Well , guess what ?
 I 'm frustrated with me , too .
 - Eli , you 're not pathetic . - No ?
 ' Cause this morning , I couldn 't even defend my own home .
 My wife had to come save me .
 ' Cause I thought he was gonna beat you to a pulp .
 He probably would have .
 But the fact that you had to step in , that makes it hurt even worse .
 - I was just trying to be helpful . - I know .
 But sometimes , honey ,
 I just need a fucking win .
 Okay ?
 I just want to feel like a man and save a dog and have that be good enough .
 You 're right .
 - It was a good day .
 - Thank you .
 I didn 't lock the door .
 Okay , all right . Call the police .
 Hey .
 Look , hey , man , l- let me just start by offering my ...
 No !
 Get off me , you bitch !
 Jade ! Jade !
 Jade !
 Where the fuck is she ?
 You broke my leg , you crazy bitch !
 Fuck with my family again , and I 'll break the other one .
 - How 's your food ? - Excellent .
 - Yours ? - Yeah , it 's- it 's really good .
 Good .
 So you 're going to college in the fall ?
 - Art school . - Oh , that 's right .
 You like to draw .
 That 's cute .
 Yeah .
 Oh , what the hell ?
 Sorry to interrupt your evening . Hello , Tommy .
 Mrs. Grove .
 What are you doing here , Mom ?
 I need a moment .
 For what ?
 I brought someone .
 Brad would like to talk to you .
 I 'm in the middle of dinner .
 Well , Tommy doesn 't mind . Do you ?
 No .
 - Simone ... - Don 't look at me .
 People will see .
 Okay .
 There 's something I want to say .
 Look , I only went out with Amy to make you jealous .
 It was a , it was dumb thing to do . I was just hurt , you know ?
 Because I like you so much .
 But I was thinking that if we put a name to what we 've been doing , then I would know how you felt about me , but you 're not into it , so I 'll ...
 I will back off . You can look at me now .
 I must really like you a lot to wear this god- awful thing .
 Well . I guess the wedding 's back on , then . Oh .
 Apparently so .
 Back to us . Are you free Friday ?
 Yes , ma 'am .
 Don 't call me ma 'am .
 Yes , lover .
 Ma 'am will be fine .
 Thank you again for inviting us . Everything was lovely .
 We are so glad you came .
 I can 't remember the last time we laughed so hard .
 You 're an absolute delight .
 I hope we see you again very soon .
 Robert , you 're a lucky man , son .
 Hope you know that .
 Yes , sir .
 - Good night . - Good night .
 So how did you figure it out ?
 Oh , crap . I left a joint in my pocket , didn 't I ?
 You did .
 You absolutely did .
 I knew something was up .
 You 've been acting strangely for weeks .
 So why did you smoke it ?
 To get back at me ?
 Well ...
 I don 't blame you .
 I 'm sorry .
 My walk on the wild side is over .
 Won 't happen again .
 I have one question . What 's that ?
 Why did you want to try marijuana ?
 I thought it would be fun to break the rules .
 Does that sound ... stupid ?
 Not at all .
 My life feels like one of those stupid swan napkins .
 It 's rigid , it 's all tight folds and sharp edges .
 And people admire it , but it takes so much work .
 And it 's goddamned exhausting .
 Course it is .
 We 've forgotten to find time in our life for joy .
 Joy ?
 Hell , I 'd settle for a few laughs now and then .
 I would love to hear you laugh again .
 I 'd break every rule in the book for that .
 I 'm starting to realize you 're not the good little girl I thought you were .
 No , sir .
 I 'm a rebel .
 Okay . Okay .
 We 've got to do something , tonight .
 Something ... crazy !
 Crazy and hilarious .
 But what ? I mean ... what can we do ? What ?
 I 'm actually getting excited .
 Rob ...
 We 're being too loud .
 I thought you were a rebel .
 You 're right .
 If you visit your local morgue , you 'll find the bodies of good people who made bad choices .

 Some engaged in reckless love affairs .
 Some invited violent strangers into their home .
 And some kept dark secrets from those they loved .
 Yes , it 's choices like these that lead to death .
 And more importantly , murder .
