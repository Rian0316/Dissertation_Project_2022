 Excuse me .
 - May I help you ?
 - Oh , I really hope so .
 What can I do for you ?
 My firm submitted plans for Mesa Verde Bank ... ... we 're building a branch here .
 Sure , I think I saw that come through .
 As I was cleaning up , refiling all our plans internally ... ... I realized I was missing one of the old versions .
 We had some late changes to the conference room dimensions ... ... so different versions floated around .
 Things got complicated , sorry .
 [ SlGHS ]
 So long story short , I think it 's possible the wrong version ... ... ended up in our proposal .
 - Oh , dear .
 - Yeah .
 So I have the correct plans here ... ... and I was hoping to just take a look at the approved plans to compare them ?

 - Just to make sure . - Okay . But if they 're wrong , you have to ...
 Refile . Yeah , I know .
 Heh .
 I just wanna make sure they 're the wrong ones ... ... before I , uh , get into it with my bosses .
 No problem .
 - Mesa Verde ? - Yes .
 - Do you have the address ?
 - 8783 Baylor Street .
 - I 'll be right back .
 - Thank you .



 Here we go .
 - Oh , I 'll come around to you .
 - Oh , good , thanks .
 Heh .

 Okay .
 Yup .
 Dates match .
 That 's a good start . Ha .
 Uh , all right , conference room is on sheet A 1 . 1 .

 Room dimensions should be 15- foot- 6 by 12- foot- 6 . Fifteen- foot- six by 12- foot- six . Great .
 Break or sprain ? - Huh ?
 - Your foot . Oh .
 A sprain .
 I started trail running a couple months ago .
 Went for a run last week , wasn 't paying attention ... ... got my foot snagged in one of the roots .
 Just twisted my ankle .
 Oof .
 Do you have a setback for that conference room wall ... ... at 2 feet , 10 inches ?
 Yes , the wall is set back 2 feet , 10 inches . So far so good .
 It hasn 't been that bad except I have an 8- month- old , so ...
 Oh , congratulations . Thanks .
 Been , you know , kind of doing it on my own .
 My brother 's been helping since I 'm a little limited .
 - Driving me around and whatnot . - It 's nice to have family around .
 Yeah , for the most part .
 Heh . He tries .
 That 's the important thing , right ? - Oh . Yeah .
 - Okay .
 I think these are the same .
 Am I missing anything ?


 - They look the same to me .
 Ha- ha .
 - Great .
 - Yes .
 - No refiling . Thank you .
 Thank you , Shirley .
 God .
 - You 're welcome . - You saved my life .
 I am telling you , my bosses would 've murdered me .
 I understand .
 You 're the only person in charge of organization ... ... and suddenly everything 's your fault , right ?
 - Mm- hm . - I assume you would know all about that .
 Yo , Lizzie .

 Hey , lady .
 He 's fine . But he 's very hungry .

 - And he 's like a little eating machine . - Bill .

 - Bill . Where is Aidan ? He 's fine .

 - You left my child in your Jeep ?

 - Give me the keys . I 'm not gonna check .
 - Where are you going ?
 - To get Aidan .

 - I 'm so sorry .

 For saving Don Hector 's life . I just visited him .
 You know , seeing a man like that , can 't speak , can barely move ...
 I wanted to weep .
 But it could have been worse .
 Varga tells me that while everyone else was picking their asses ... ... you rushed to him , struck him on the chest and brought him back .
 It was a simple instinct .

 [ EXHALES ]
 Mr. McGill ?
 We 're ready for you now .
 Great .
 CHAlRMAN :
 It looks like you 've completed the Pre- Prosecution Diversion Program ?
 That 's right .
 Three and a half weeks ago .
 I believe if you look at the supplemental materials ... ... there 's a letter from my supervisor , Brad Markham .
 Ah .
 Good .
 He says he was impressed with your commitment .
 And for most of last year you 've been employed at CC Mobile ?
 It 's a cell phone store .
 And , again , there 's a letter from my manager , Mr. Robert Finn .
 It 's also in the supplemental materials .

 Says here you were part of something called the Silver Circle ?
 - Three months in a row ? - It 's a sales award .
 Mr. Finn and the people at CC Mobile have been very generous .
 You don 't have to sell many phones to get in the Silver , believe me .
 What made you choose that particular field ?
 Honestly ?
 Just to put bread on the table . But I would say it 's given me a new outlook on client relations .
 After dealing with cell phone contracts , explaining statutes to my clients ... ... should be a cakewalk .
 As the saying goes , " The law is constantly changing . "
 Have you been keeping yourself apprised of the latest developments ?
 I 've been reading the You know , what caught my eye recently was
 Any of you follow that ?
 It has to do with the admissibility of ex parte examinations .
 - That was a Supreme Court case ? - That 's right .
 How did it go ?
 " The only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy ... ... constitutional demands is the one the Constitution ... ... actually prescribes : confrontation . "


 It 's classic Scalia .
 I can 't help but think about victims forced to confront their assailants in open court .
 But on the other hand , the Sixth Amendment is pretty controlling ...
 Ahem . I 'm sorry . I just ...
 I get rolling on constitutional questions . Short answer , I 've been doing my level best .
 Heh .

 Mr. McGill , is there anything you 'd like to tell us about the reasons ... ... you were suspended in the first place ?
 This past year , that 's pretty much been the only thing on my mind .
 And I 'm humbled by the sheer stupidity of my actions .
 Remorse doesn 't begin to cover it . I 'm not gonna make excuses , because there 's no excuse for what I did .
 But as I sit here , I can assure you ... ... nothing like that will ever happen again .
 Never . Well , all right .
 That would seem to be satisfactory .
 Uh ...
 Meg ? You have something ?
 Mr. McGill , what does the law mean to you ?


 The law ?

 Uh ...
 Yeah .
 Okay .

 Um ...
 Listen , growing up ... ... becoming a lawyer was the last thing on my mind .
 Even if I wanted to , I didn 't have the smarts or the skills ... ... or the " stick- to- it- iveness . "
 But I happened to get a job with some attorneys ... ... and I couldn 't help but think " Maybe I could do that ? "
 Something inside me made me wanna try .
 Now , listen :
 My diploma says the University of American Samoa Law School .
 And that 's exactly what it sounds like , that 's a correspondence school .
 I wish it said Georgetown , heh ... ... or Northwestern .
 But UAS was the only one that would take me .
 Because , let me tell you , I wasn 't a natural .
 I mean , the classes , the studying , trying to pass the bar ?
 Practically killed me .
 I must have quit 10 or 12 times ... ... but I kept coming back to it .
 And I 'm really glad I did .
 Because when I got to work with actual clients ... ... there was nothing else like it .
 Our legal system is complicated , and sometimes it could feel capricious ... ... but it 's the closest thing to real justice that we 've got .
 And for it to work , it needs vigorous , passionate advocates .
 Helping my clients , you know ... ... arguing on their behalf ... ... that 's the best thing I 've ever done .
 And this past year ... ... I 've missed the hell out of it .

 That was very eloquent .
 Was there any particular influence on your views ?
 Um ... Credit where credit is due .
 The University of American Samoa .
 Go , Land Crabs .

 Anything else ? - No . Thank you .
