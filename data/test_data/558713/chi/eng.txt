 AT AN ELABORATE WEDDlNG
 THE SCAVOS WOULDN 'T HAVE TO PAY FOR .

 CAN YOU BELlEVE THAT ?
 I 'M SURE SHE DlDN 'T MEAN TO HURT YOUR FEELlNGS ,
 BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KNOW PARADlSE
 IS BY REPENTlNG YOUR SlNS .
 WHEN SHE SAlD THAT TO ME ,
 SUDDENLY IT HlT ME HOW I WAS GOlNG TO GET BACK AT HER .
 FROM NOW ON ,
 I 'M GOlNG TO BE SO GOOD .
 I 'M GOlNG TO EAT MY VEGETABLES ,
 I- I 'M GOlNG TO GET GOOD GRADES ,
 I 'M GOlNG TO SAY " YES , MA 'AM" AND " NO , MA 'AM . "
 I 'M GOlNG TO MAKE HER BELlEVE
 THAT GOD HAS DELlVERED HER THlS LlTTLE MlRACLE .
 UNTlL ONE DAY ,
 WHEN SHE LEAST EXPECTS IT ,
 I 'M GOlNG TO DO SOMETHlNG SO AWFUL
 IT IS GOlNG TO ROCK HER WORLD .
 I MEAN , IT IS REALLY GOlNG TO DESTROY HER .
 AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES ...
 I 'LL KNOW PARADlSE .
 Mary Alice : YES, LlFE IS A JOURNEY ,
 ONE THAT IS MUCH BETTER TRAVELED WlTH A COMPANlON BY OUR SlDE .

 A NElGHBOR ON THE OTHER SlDE OF THE STREET ...
 I 'M COMlNG . JEEZ , HOLD YOUR WATER .
 THERE YOU GO .
 NO MORE POST- NUP .
 OR THE MAN ON THE OTHER SlDE OF THE BED .
 THE COMPANlON CAN BE A MOTHER WlTH GOOD INTENTlONS ...
 THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL SERVlCE , REVEREND .
 THANK YOU SO MUCH , BREE .
 OR A CHlLD WHO 'S UP TO NO GOOD .
 VERY INSPlRATlONAL .
 STlLL , DESPlTE OUR BEST INTENTlONS ,
 SOME OF US WlLL LOSE OUR COMPANlONS ALONG THE WAY .
 AND THEN THE JOURNEY BECOMES UNBEARABLE .
 YOU SEE ,
 HUMAN BElNGS ARE DESlGNED FOR MANY THlNGS ,
 BUT LONELlNESS ISN 'T ONE OF THEM .
