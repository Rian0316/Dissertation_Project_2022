 So , Kathy , the Prime Minister saw fit to invite one into the Cabinet and , well , here one is .
 Isn 't it a terrific responsibility ?

 I suppose , if one chooses to dedicate one 's life to public service , responsibility is something one accepts .
 - But all this power !
 - I know , I know ! Frightening sometimes .
 But it also makes one very humble .
 There one sits at the Cabinet table , Number 10 Downing Street , and one realises ...
 Bernard rang , O humble one .
 Central House want you to watch a programme on BBC2 .
 Maureen Watkins , MP .
 One of the backbench MPs . Not my favourite lady .
 A rampaging feminist .
 I don 't think I 'll bother . Don 't write that down .
 I like Maureen Watkins .
 Don 't you think that women are still the exploited sex ?
 All of us in 5B think that women are exploited at work and at home and still it 's a world designed by men and run by men for men 's convenience .
 - Like SHE says .
 - Not any longer , surely ?
 - She doesn 't carry any weight in the House .
 - No , it 's full of men . - Thank you .
 Anything else you 'd like to ask ?
 - Just one last question .
 As a minister with all this power , what have you personally achieved ?
 Achieved ? Oh , well , all sorts of things .
 Membership of the Privy Council , the Party Policy Committee ...
 No , things you 've done that makes life better for other people .
 - Makes life better ?
 - Yes . For other people ?
 There must be a number of things .
 That 's what one 's job is all about .
 18 hours a day , 7 days a week .
 Could you give me examples ?
 - Makes it a bit boring otherwise .
 - Examples . Difficult to know where to start .
 So much of government is collective decisions .
 All of us together , best minds in the country , hammering it out .
 But what will you look back on afterwards and say " I did that . " You know , like a writer can look at his books .
 Government is a complex business .
 So many people have to have their say . These things take time .
 Rome wasn 't built in a day ...
 Good heavens , is that the time ?
 I really must be getting my boxes .
 Excuse me . - Oh , thank you .
 - Thank you so much .
 Such fun , having this little talk .
 And you 'll let me approve the article , as we agreed ?
 - Bye . - Bye .


 Bright kid .
 Last interview I give for a school magazine .
 She asked some difficult questions .
 Just innocent .
 She assumed there was some moral basis to your activities . - Well , there is . - Oh , Jim , don 't be silly !



 - ( SlGHS ) - What are you sighing for ?
 I 'm not sighing .
 ( SlGHS )
 - Out with it .
 - Well , what have I achieved ? She 's right .
 - It really does make you humble !
 - I can 't get any bills through .
 - The time 's taken up for the next two years .
 - Reform the Civil Service . - Impossible .
 Catch 22 . - Why ?
 Supposing I suggested 50 terrific reforms , who would have to implement them ?

 ( BOTH ) The Civil Service .
 All right , I tell you what .
 Not 50 reforms , just one .
 Huh ! What ?
 If you achieve one import reform , that 'd be something .
 Get me in the record books !
 What do you suggest ?
 Make them put more women into top jobs .
 Women are half the population , they should be half the Permanent Secretaries .
 - How many women are there at the top ?
 - Not many . Equal opportunities .

 I 'll have a go .
 After all , there 's a principle at stake .
 You 're going to do something out of pure principle ?
 - Yes . - Oh , Jim .
 Principles are excellent vote winners .

 - We don 't have to do anything ?
 - No .
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 are wrong .
 And all the other points are covered .
 I don 't have to make a decision .
 I don 't even have to apologise .
 - Can you do a reply for me ?
 - Done it . Fantastic .
 Why don 't they make more Under- Secretaries like you ?
 - Anything else , Minister ? - No .
 Tell me , Sarah , how many women are there at the top of the Civil Service ?
 No Permanent Secretaries .
 Four out of 150 Deputy Secretaries .
 - What about your grade ? Under- Secretary ?
 - There are 27 of us .
 - Doesn 't sound too bad .
 Out of how many ?
 - 578 .

 - But that 's appalling !
 Aren 't you appalled ? - Not really . I find it comic .
 But then I find most of the Civil Service comic .
 It 's run by men , after all .
 What can you ?
 What can I do ?
 - Are you serious , Minister ?
 - Yes .
 It 's easy .
 Bring top women from the professions , commerce , industry , straight into the top grades .
 The pay is good for women .
 Long holidays , pensions . You 'd get high- quality applicants .
 - And they could do the job ?
 - Of course .
 With respect , if you can make a journalist MP into a minister , why can 't you make a senior partner from a legal firm into an Under- Secretary ?
 Most of the work here only needs about two O- levels , anyway . - Good point .
 Sarah , thank you very much . - Thank you , Minister .


 - You rang , Minister ?
 - Bernard , Sarah told ...
 - Yes , Minister ?
 - I wish you 'd call me Jim when we 're alone .
 Oh , I 'll try to remember that , Minister .
 Sarah tells me this complaint is nonsense .
 - Oh , fine .
 So we can CGSM it . - CGSM ?
 Civil service code .
 It stands for Consignment of Geriatric Shoe Manufacturers .
 Load of old cobblers , Minister .
 I 'm not a civil servant .
 I shall use my own code . I shall write " round objects " .

 Ah , Minister , you wanted a word about staffing ?
 - Yes , Humphrey .
 - Morning , Bernard .
 I 've made a policy decision .
 I 'm going to do something about the number of women in the Civil Service .
 Surely there aren 't all that many . - That 's my point .
 - The Minister thinks we need more .
 - Many more . - More ?
 We 're quite well up to establishment on typists , cleaners and tea ladies .

 Any ideas , Bernard ?
 - We are a bit short on temporary secretaries .
 - I 'm talking about Permanent Secretaries .
 - Permanent ...
 - We need female mandarins .
 Sort of satsumas , Minister .

 Sit down , will you , Bernard . - How many Permanent Secretaries are there ?
 - 41 , I believe .
 - And how many of those are women ?
 - Well , broadly speaking ...
 Not having the figures to hand , I 'm not sure .
 - Approximately . - Approximately ... none .

 None .
 And I understand there are about 150 Deputy Secretaries .
 How many are women ?
 - Well , it 's difficult to say . - Why ?
 There 's a lot of old women among the men .
 - Four .
 - Are there really ?
 I 'm going to announce a quota of 25 % women Deputy Secretaries and Permanent Secretaries to be achieved in four years .
 Wait a minute , Minister .
 I 'm obviously in total sympathy with your objectives .
 - Obviously . - Of course we must have more women .
 All of us are deeply concerned by this apparent imbalance , but these things take time . Of course !



 - I want to make a start straight away .
 - I agree .
 I propose we make a start by setting up an inter- departmental committee ...
 No , no , no .
 That 's not what I meant and you know it .
 No delays . This needs a sledgehammer .
 We must cut through the red tape .
 - You can 't cut tape with a sledgehammer ...
 - You know what I mean .
 Minister , you do me an injustice .
 I was not about to suggest delays .
 - Oh , sorry . - That 's all right .
 I suggest that , if we are to have 25 % quota , we need a larger intake at the recruitment stage so eventually there 'll be 25 % in the top jobs .
 - When ? - ( BOTH ) In 25 years .
 No , Humphrey , you haven 't quite got my drift .
 I mean NOW .

 - Oh ... you mean , NOW ?
 - Got it in one , Humphrey .
 It takes time to do things NOW .
 The three articles of Civil Service faith :
 It takes longer to do things quickly ; it 's more expensive to do them cheaply and more democratic to do them in secret .
 I have suggested four years .
 Masses of time .
 Oh , dear me , no !
 I don 't mean political time , I mean real time .
 Civil servants are grown like ...
 like oak trees , not mustard and cress .
 They bloom and ripen with the seasons , they mature like ...
 - Like yourself .
 - Well , I was about to say like an old port .
 Like Grimsby , perhaps .
 - Yes , I was being serious , Minister .
 - I foresaw this problem .
 I propose we solve it by bringing in top women from outside the service to fill vacancies in the top jobs .
 I ...
 - I don 't think I quite understood .
 - Watch my mouth , Humphrey .
 We will bring in women from outside .
 But the strength of the system is that it is pure and unsullied by outside influences .
 People move jobs .
 Why should the Civil Service be different ?
 It IS different .
 It demands subtlety .
 - Discretion .
 - Devotion to duty .
 - Soundness .
 - Soundness !
 Well said , Bernard !
 Civil servants require endless patience and boundless understanding .
 They need to be able to change horses mid- stream , as politicians change what they call their minds .
 - You have these talents ?
 - Well , it is just that one 's been properly ...
 - Matured . Like Grimsby . - Trained .
 Ask yourself if there isn 't something wrong with the system .
 - Why are there so few women deputies ?
 - They keep leaving to have babies .
 - At nearly 50 ? Surely not .
 - I don 't know . I 'm on your side .
 - We do need more women at the top .
 - I 'm not waiting 25 years .
 - There 's a vacancy for Deputy Secretary here .
 - Ye- es . - I shall appoint a woman .
 Sarah Harrison .
 - Sarah Harrison ? !
 - I think she 's very able , don 't you ?
 - Very . For a woman , for a person .
 And she is an original thinker .
 Yes , that 's true , but she doesn 't let it interfere with her work .
 - What have you got against her ?
 - Nothing . She 's excellent . I 'm a supporter of hers .

 I advocated her promotion to Under- Secretary at a very early age .
 - Would you agree that she is outstanding ?
 - Yes . - So , on balance , it is a good idea ?

 - On balance ... yes and no .
 - That 's not a very clear answer .
 - It 's a balanced answer .
 The point is she 's too young and it 's not her turn .
 I knew you 'd say that !
 This is exactly what 's wrong with the Civil Service - Buggins ' turn ! - The best people should be promoted !
 - Exactly ! As soon as it 's their turn ! Oh , nonsense !
 Napoleon ruled Europe when he was in his 30s !
 - Alexander conquered the world in his 20s .
 - They 'd have made poor Deputy Secretaries . - They didn 't wait their turn !
 - And look what happened to them .
 And look what 's happened to us !
 Instead of being run by a lot of young , able , energetic men , this country 's being run by tired , cynical 55- year- olds who just want a quiet life !
 Had you anyone specific in mind ?

 Yes and no , Humphrey .
 Oh , Minister , Sarah Harrison is an excellent civil servant and a bright hope for the future , but she is our most junior Under- Secretary and I will not recommend her promotion .
 - I think you 're a sexist .
 - Minister , how could you say such a thing ?
 I 'm very pro- women .
 Wonderful people , women .
 Sarah is a dear lady .
 I 'm one of her greatest admirers .
 But , if the cause of women is to be advanced , it must be done with care , tact and discretion .
 She is our only woman contender for a top job . We mustn 't push her too fast .
 - Women find top jobs very difficult .
 - Can you hear yourself ?
 If women could be good Permanent Secretaries , there would be more of them .
 Stands to reason . - No ... - I 'm not anti- feminist !
 I love women !
 Some of my best friends are women !
 Er ... my wife , indeed .

 But Sarah is as yet very inexperienced and her children are still of school age . - They might get mumps ! - You might get shingles !
 I might indeed if you continue in this vein .
 What if her children caused her to miss work ?
 Would she have reached Under- Secretary in that case ?
 She is the best person !
 If you promote women just because they 're the best person , you will create a lot of resentment throughout the Civil Service !
 - Not from the women in it .
 - Well , that hardly matters , does it ?
 Hardly matters ?

 There are so few of them .

 I 've told him women are different , but he can 't grasp it . They put such strains on a team .
 They react differently .
 They 're so emotional . Not rational like us . No .
 It 's hopeless when you tell them off .
 Either they get into a frightful bate or start blubbing .
 And if they 're not the sort who blub , they become frightfully hard and butch .
 Not the least bit attractive .
 - They 're full of prejudices .
 - Make silly generalisations .
 - They think in stereotypes .
 - ( BOTH ) Mmm .
 Arnold , what do you think I should do ?
 Lecture him at such length on the matter that he becomes bored and loses interest in the idea .
 Yes , might work .
 Mind you , he doesn 't get bored easily .
 - He even finds himself interesting .
 - They all do .
 - All the ones who listen to what we 're saying .
 - Not many of those .
 The standard second ploy is to tell him the unions won 't wear it .
 - They 'd like it . - That 's beside the point .
 - Oh , yes , sorry .
 - What does his wife think about all this ?
 I gather she 's in favour of promoting Harrison .
 In fact , she may be behind it . I see .
 Does she know that Sarah Harrison is rather attractive ?
 No , I don 't think they 've ever met ...

 Good idea .
 We must mobilise the Cabinet against this quota nonsense .
 - They 'll be in favour of it .
 - We can get them to change their minds .
 - They change their minds fairly easily .
 - Just like a lot of women !
 Thank God they don 't blub !

 Minister , I have come to the conclusion that you were right . - Are you being serious ?
 - Yes , indeed .
 I have taken your ideas on board and I am now positively against discrimination against women and in favour of positive discrimination - discriminating discrimination , of course .
 Yes ...
 I think I 've got that .
 The view is , at the very highest level , that this should happen .
 - Good . - However ...

 There is a problem about the quota .
 Mind if I sit down ? The unions won 't wear it .
 - Really ? Let 's have 'em in .
 We 'll talk about it . - Er ... no , Minister .
 - That would ... just stir up a hornets ' nest .

 - Why ?
 Well , if I might suggest ... that we be realistic about this .
 - By realistic , you mean drop the whole scheme . - Oh , dear me , no !
 But , perhaps , a pause to re- group .
 A lull in which to reassess the situation and discuss alternative strategies .
 A space of time for reflection and deliberation . You mean drop the whole scheme .
 No , I 've set my hand to the plough , I 've made the decision .
 We shall have a 25 % quota of women within the next four years and , to make a start , I shall appoint Sarah Harrison .
 - I promise you , that is the wrong decision .
 - Principle , Humphrey , principle .
 I 'm sure my Cabinet colleagues will support me .
 There 's a lot of votes in women 's rights .
 Votes ?
 I thought you said it was a matter of principle .

 For ME .
 I was talking about them .
 - ( PHONE RlNGS ) - Yes ?
 - Mrs Hacker 's here . - Send her in .
 Could she come in ?
 Could you sign the letters before you go , Minister ?
 - Hello . Get Humphrey to give you a drink .
 - Sherry ?

 Remember that letter you wrote " round objects " on ?
 Sir Humphrey has commented on it .
 - What 's he say ?
 - " Who is Round and to what does he object ? "

 Here you are .
 Your very good health .
 Yes , it 's a slow business changing the Civil Service .
 What about promoting this woman Jim was talking about ?
 Oh , yes , well ... your husband certainly has an eye for talent and Sarah 's very talented .
 - Quite delightful , real charmer .
 Cheers . - Really ?
 I very much admire this new generation of women civil servants compared to the old battle- axes I remember !

 Of course , they 're not all as beautiful as Sarah , but ... they do manage to keep their femininity .
 - Jim never discussed what she looks like . - Oh , well , perhaps he hasn 't noticed .
 I find that hard to believe .
 He does spend a lot of time with her .
 And even more ... if she 's promoted .
 Shall we sit down ?


 And so , gentlemen , my minister is set on creating a quota of 25 % women , leading to an eventual 50 % .
 - Parity , I see . - Yes .
 Mm .
 It seems right and proper to me that men and women be treated fairly and equally .
 I speak for all of us when I say that , in principle , there should be such targets set and goals achieved .
 ( MURMURS OF AGREEMENT )
 - Bill ?
 - Well , I 'm fully in favour of this idea .
 We must have positive discrimination in favour of women .
 It wouldn 't work with the Foreign Office .
 We couldn 't post women ambassadors to Iran or Muslim nations .
 - No , quite , quite .
 - The Third World is not so advanced as us .
 And as we have to send diplomats to new postings every three years , this idea is obviously not for us , but I do approve the principle .
 - Neil ?
 - I 'm in favour of it .
 I think we need the feminine touch .
 Women are better at handling some problems than men .
 No doubt about it . We would have to make an exception in the Home Office .
 Women are not the right people to run prisons or the police .
 Quite probably , they wouldn 't want to do it , anyway .
 - But you do agree with the principle ?
 - Oh , yes , without question . - Peter ?
 - Yes , the same applies to Defence ... alas .
 All those admirals and generals .
 It wouldn 't be possible to appoint a woman as Head of Security .
 M would have to become F.

 Yes , Defence is clearly a man 's world , like Industry and Employment . All those trade union leaders !
 But what about the DHSS ? John ?
 I 'm happy to say woman are well represented near the top of the DHSS .
 After all , we have two of the four Deputy Secretaries in Whitehall .
 Not eligible for Permanent Secretary because they 're Deputy Chief Medical Officers .
 I 'm not sure they 're really suitable .
 No , that 's unfair .
 Of course , women are 80 % of our clerical staff and 99 % of the typing grades .
 We 're not doing too badly .
 In principle , I 'm in favour of them going to the top .
 Good , good .
 The feeling of the meeting is , in principle , that we 're all in favour of equal rights for the ladies , but there are special problems in individual departments .
 - ( ALL ) Hear hear !
 - What about this question of the quota ?
 - Frankly , I 'm against it .
 - ( ALL ) Oh , yes , not on !
 We must , in my view , have the right to promote the best man for the job , regardless of sex .
 Speaking as an ardent feminist myself ,
 I think the problem lies in recruiting the right sort of women .
 Married women with families drop out because they cannot give their work their full , single- minded attention .
 Unmarried women with no children are not fully- rounded people with a thorough understanding of life .
 So , in practice , it 's rarely possible to find a fully- rounded married woman , with a happy home and three children , prepared to devote virtually her whole life to a department .
 It 's Catch 22 , really .
 Well , Catch 22 , sub- paragraph A !
 I think we must ensure that our respective ministers oppose this quota idea in Cabinet by drawing our own minister 's attention to each department 's special problems .
 But we will recommend the principle of equal opportunities at every level . ( MURMURS OF AGREEMENT )
 May I suggest one more thing ?
 My minister sees the promotion of women as a means of creating greater diversity at the top of the service .
 We should stress to our ministers that , frankly , you couldn 't find a more diverse lot than us .
 - ( ALL ) Absolutely !
 - A real cross- section of the nation .

 Ah , Minister , how was Cabinet ?
 - Bit odd , actually .
 - Why ?
 We were talking about the top jobs quota for women .
 - Was it agreed ? - That 's what 's so odd .
 They all agreed in principle , but then said it wouldn 't work in their own departments .
 - They didn 't support me at all .
 - Extraordinary . And I 'm not getting support from Annie .

 - Really ? What , about this quota ?
 - Well , about promoting Sarah .
 - You 'd think she 'd be 100 % behind it .
 - Indeed . She goes sort of distant when I mention it .

 - Dead against it now .
 - Even more extraordinary .
 Oh , well , seems the only thing left .
 - Something I can achieve .
 - Yes , indeed . Shall I ask Mrs Harrison to come in ?

 Bernard , would you be kind enough ?
 At least this is something I can say I have done .
 - Indeed . - Lighting a spark .
 Carrying a torch , even .

 Ah , Sarah , do sit down . - Thank you . - Humphrey .
 Sarah , as you know , there is a vacancy for a Deputy Secretary in this department .
 In spite of you being the most junior Under- Secretary , but because you are the outstanding person ,
 Sir Humphrey and I will recommend you for promotion to the grade of Deputy Secretary .
 I ...
 I don 't know what to say .
 - No need to say anything .
 - A single thank you should suffice .
 No ...
 Well ...
 I mean ... Oh , gosh .

 Look , this is awfully embarrassing .
 I mean ... Well , I was going to tell you this week .

 I 'm resigning from the Civil Service .
 - What ?
 - Resigning ?
 Yes , so ... thank you , but no , thank you .
 - Some problem at home with your children ?
 - Mumps ?
 No , I 'm joining a merchant bank ... as a director .
 Sarah ...
 I won 't conceal from you the fact that this is a blow .
 The reason Humphrey and I decided to recommend you is that I 've been fighting a losing battle to improve promotion prospects for women .
 You were to be my , so to speak , Trojan horse .
 Quite honestly , Minister , I want a job where I don 't spend endless hours circulating information about subjects that don 't matter to people who aren 't interested .
 I want a job where there 's achievement rather than merely activity . I 'm tired of pushing paper . I want to point to something and say " I did that . "
 I don 't understand .
 I know . That 's why I 'm leaving .

 You 're not saying the government is unimportant ?
 No , it 's very important .
 It 's just that I haven 't met anyone who 's doing it .
 Also I 've had enough of the pointless intrigue . - Intrigue ? - You know the sort of thing .
 Like this women 's rights nonsense .
 Your using me as a Trojan horse , for instance .
 They probably said the unions wouldn 't wear it if you promoted me .
 - How did you know that ? - I didn 't .
 I just know how things are done .

 You don 't realise I 've fought quite a battle for you .
 Oh , have you ?
 I didn 't ask you to fight a battle for me .
 I 'm not pleased at being part of a 25 % quota .
 Women are not inferior beings and I don 't enjoy being patronised .
 I 'm afraid you 're just as paternalist and chauvinist as the rest of them .
 I 'm going somewhere where I shall be accepted an equal , as a person . You can 't win , can you ?

 - May I go now ?
 - Hm ?
 Yes , of course .


 I 'm sorry I offended you , though I can 't remember how I did . No .
 And thank you .
 I know you both mean well .

 Women ! Yes , Minister .
