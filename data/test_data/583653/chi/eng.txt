 - Hi , guys . - Hey , Phoebe .
 How did it go ?
 Not so good .
 He walked me home and said , " We should do this again . "
 He said , " We should do it again . " That 's good , right ?
 Loosely translated , " We should do this again , " means :
 " You wiII never see me naked . "
 Since when ?
 Since always . It 's , Iike , " dating " Ianguage .
 Like , " It 's not you , " means , " It is you . "
 " You 're nice , " means , " I 'II be dating Ieather- clad alcoholics . . . . . . and complaining about them to you . "
 " I think we should see other people , " means :
 " Ha , ha , I already am ! "
 Everybody knows this ?
 Cushions the blow .
 Like your parents putting the dog to sleep . . . . . . and saying it went to Iive on a farm .
 Because our parents actuaIly did . . . . . . send our dog off to Iive on a farm .
 That 's funny .
 Ross . . . ? HeIlo !
 The Milner 's farm in Connecticut ?
 The Milners had this unbelievable farm .
 They had horses and rabbits to chase .
 And it was . . . .
 Oh , my God ! Chi- Chi !
 The One With the Thumb
 English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .
 " How does it feeI knowing you 're about to die ? "
 Warden , in five minutes my pain wiII be over .
 But you 'II Iive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die .
 That was reaIly good !
 Thanks . Let 's keep going .
 " So , what do you want from me , Dimon ? Huh ? "
 I just wanna go back to my ceIl , because in my ceII I can smoke .
 " Smoke away ! "
 I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his ceII alone . - What ?
 - Relax your hand .
 Let your wrist go .
 Not so much . AII right .
 Now try taking a puff .
 Right . Give it to me .

 I 'm not giving you a cigarette .
 It 's fine .
 Do you want to get this part or not ?
 AII right .
 Now , don 't think of it as a cigarette .
 Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand .
 When you 're holding it , you feeI right .
 You feeI complete .
 You miss it ?
 No , not so much . AII right .
 Now we smoke .
 Oh , my God !

 It 's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy 's thumb . . . . . . to the tip of his index finger .
 That 's ridiculous .
 Can I use either thumb ? AII right .
 Don 't teII me .
 Decaf cappuccino for Joey .
 Coffee , black .
 Latte .
 And an iced tea .
 I 'm getting good at this .
 ExceIlent !
 Good for me !
 You okay , Phoebe ?
 It 's not even worth --
 It 's my bank .
 What did they do ?
 I 'm going through my mail , and I open up their monthly " statement . "
 Easy !
 And there 's $500 extra in my account .
 Satan 's minions at work again !
 Now I have to go down there and deaI with them --
 What are you talking about ? Keep it !
 It 's not mine .
 If I kept it , it would be Iike stealing .
 Yeah , but if you spent it , it would be Iike shopping .
 Say I bought a great pair of shoes .
 Know what I 'd hear with every step I took ?
 " Not mine . Not mine . Not mine . "
 And even if I was happy and skipping . . . . . . I 'd hear , " Not- not mine .
 Not- not mine . "
 We 're with you . We got it .
 I 'd never be able to enjoy it . It 'd be Iike this giant karmic debt .
 Chandler , what are you doing ?
 What are you doing ?
 Oh , gross !
 What is this ?
 I 'm smoking ! I 'm smoking !
 You 've been so good for three years !
 And this is my reward .
 Just think about what you went through the Iast time you quit .
 So this time I won 't quit .
 AII right !
 I 'm putting it out !
 Oh , no !
 I can 't drink this now .
 I 'm gonna go change . I 've got a date .
 Is this Alan again ? How 's it going ?
 It 's going pretty good . It 's nice and we 're having fun .
 When do we get to meet the guy ?
 Let 's see , today 's Monday . . . .
 Never !
 Not after what happened with Steve .
 What do you mean ?
 We love Steve . Steve was sexy !
 Sorry .
 I don 't know how I feeI about him . Let me figure it out .
 Then can we meet him ?
 Sorry .
 Why should they meet him ?
 I bring a guy home and they 're aII over him Iike . . . . . . coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd .
 Listen , as someone who 's seen more than her share of bad beef . . . . . . I 'II teII you , that is not such a terrible thing .
 Your friends are just Iooking out after you .
 I wish that once I 'd bring a guy home they actuaIly Iiked .
 You realize the odds of that happening are a Iittle slimmer . . . . . . if they never get to meet the guy .
 Let it go , Ross .
 You didn 't know Chi- Chi .
 Do you aII promise ?
 Yeah , we promise . We 'II be good .
 Chandler , do you promise to be good ?
 You can come in , but your filter tip Iittle buddy stays outside !
 " Dear Ms. Buffay :
 Thank you for caIling .
 We have credited your account $500 .
 We 're sorry for the inconvenience . . . . . . and hope you 'II accept this footbaII phone . . .
 . . . as our gift . " Do you believe it ?
 Now I have $ 1 000 and a footbaII phone .
 What bank is this ?
 Okay , it 's him . - Who is it ?
 - Alan .
 Chandler !
 He 's here !
 Please be good . Please ?

 Just remember how much you aII Iike me .
 Alan , this is everybody .
 Everybody , this is Alan .
 I 've heard so much about aII you guys .
 I 'II caII you tomorrow .
 Let 's Iet the Alan- bashing begin .
 Who 's gonna take the first shot ?
 Come on !
 I 'II go .
 Let 's start with the way he kept picking at --
 I 'm sorry , I can 't do this .
 Can 't do it . We loved him .
 We loved him !
 Wait a minute !
 We 're talking about someone I 'm going out with ?

 And did you notice ?

 Know what was great ? The way his smile was crooked .
 Yes ! Like the man in the shoe !
 What shoe ?
 From the nursery rhyme .
 " There was a crooked man with a crooked smile . . . . . . who Iived in a shoe for a while . . . . "
 So I think Alan . . . . . . is the yardstick against which aII future boyfriends wiII be measured .
 What future boyfriends ?
 - I think this could be , you know , " it . " - ReaIly ?
 I 'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone .
 You know I 'II be doing that at parties , right ?
 - Know what I Iike most about him ? - What ?
 The way he makes me feeI about myself .
 How was the game ?
 WeIl . . . .
 We won ! Fantastic !
 One question :
 How is that possible ? - Alan .
 - He was unbelievable !
 He was Iike a Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs plays every position .
 But instead of Bugs , it was 1 st base , Alan . 2nd base , Alan . . . .
 It was Iike he made us into a team .
 We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softbaIl .
 Can I ask you guys a question ?
 Do you think Alan is maybe sometimes --
 What ?
 I don 't know . A Iittle too " Alan " ?
 Oh , no . That 's not possible . You can never be too " Alan . "
 It 's his innate " Alan- ness " that we adore .
 I , personaIly , could have a gaIlon of Alan .
 Hey , Lizzy .
 Hey , Weird Girl .
 - I bought alphabet soup . - Did you pick out the vowels ?
 I Ieft in the Y 's . Because " -- sometimes Y. "
 And something else .
 Saltines ?
 Would you Iike $ 1 000 and a footbaII phone ?
 What ?
 Oh , my God !
 - There 's reaIly money in here . - I know .
 What are you doing ?
 I want you to have it . I don 't want it .
 I have to give you something .
 No , it 's fine . You don 't --
 Do you want my tinfoiI hat ?
 No , you need that . It 's okay . Thanks .
 Please . Let me do something .
 I 'II teII you what .
 You buy me a soda and we 're even . Okay ?
 Keep the change .
 Thanks , Lizzy .
 Want a pretzel ?
 - No , I 'm fine . Thanks . - See you .
 A thumb ? I know .
 I opened it and there it was . . . . . . floating in there , Iike this tiny Iittle hitchhiker .
 Maybe it 's a contest ? Like " CoIlect aII five . "
 Does anyone wanna see ?
 No , thanks ! Don 't do that .
 Come on !
 It 's worse than the thumb .
 This is so unfair .
 Why is it unfair ?
 So I have a flaw !
 Big deal !
 Joey 's constant knuckle - cracking isn 't annoying ?
 And Ross , over- pronouncing every word .
 And Monica , who snorts when she Iaughs .
 I mean , what the heII is that thing ? I accept those flaws .
 Why can 't you accept me for this ?
 Does the knuckle- cracking bother everybody , or just him ?
 I could Iive without it .
 Is it Iike , a Iittle annoying ? Or is it Iike when Phoebe chews her hair ?
 Don 't Iisten to him , Pheebs . I think it 's endearing .
 Oh , you do , do you ?
 There 's nothing wrong with speaking correctly .
 Indeed there isn 't .
 I should get back to work .
 Otherwise someone might get what they actuaIly ordered .
 The hair comes out and the gloves come off .
 Did you ever go out with a guy your friends aII reaIly Iike ?
 No .
 WeIl , I 'm going out with a guy my friends aII reaIly Iike .
 Are we talking about the coyotes here ?
 AII right ! A cow got through .
 Can you believe it ?
 It 's just , you know what ?
 I just don 't feeI the " thing . "
 They feeI the thing . I don 't feeI the thing .
 Honey , you should always . . . . . . feeI the thing .
 If that 's how you feeI about the guy , dump him .
 It 's gonna be reaIly hard .
 He 's a big boy . He 'II get over it .
 No , he 'II be fine . It 's the other five I 'm worried about .
 Don 't you respect your body ?
 Don 't you see what you 're doing ?
 I 've had it with you and your cancer . . . . . . emphysema and heart disease .
 The bottom Iine is smoking is cool , and you know it .
 Alan wants to speak to you .
 ReaIly ? He does ? Hey , buddy !
 What 's up ?
 She told you about that , huh ?
 WeIl , yeah . I have one now and then . WeIl , yeah , now .
 It 's not that bad --
 WeIl , that 's true .
 Gee , no one 's ever put it Iike that before .
 WeIl , okay . Thanks .
 God , he 's good .

 If only he were a woman .
 Oh , Lamb Chop !
 How old is that sock ?
 If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years , it 'd be talking too .
 I think it 's time to change somebody 's nicotine patch .
 Where 's Joey ?
 Joey ate my Iast stick of gum , so I kiIled him .
 Do you think that was wrong ? I think he 's across the haIl .

 There you go .
 Ooh , I 'm alive with pleasure now .
 Pheebs , do you want the rest of that Pop Tart ?
 Does anyone want the rest of this Pop Tart ?
 Hey , I might .
 I 'm sorry .
 Those stupid soda people gave me $ 7000 for the thumb .
 And on my way over here I stepped in gum .
 What is up with the universe ?
 What 's going on ?
 Nothing .
 I think it 's nice when we 're together .
 It 's even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear .
 Please , guys , we have to talk .
 Wait , wait !
 I 'm getting a deja vu .
 No , I 'm not .

 We have to talk .
 There it is !
 It 's about Alan .
 There 's something you should know .
 There 's reaIly no easy way to say this .
 I 've decided to break up with Alan .
 Is there somebody else ?
 It 's just . . . . . . you know , things change .
 People change .
 We didn 't change .
 So that 's it ? It 's over ? Just Iike that ?

 You Iet your guard down . You start to care about someone , and I just --
 - I can go on pretending -- - Okay !
 That wouldn 't be fair to me , to Alan , or to you .
 WeIl , who wants fair ?
 I just want things back , you know , the way they were . I 'm sorry .

 Oh , she 's sorry . I feeI better .
 I just can 't believe this !
 With the holidays coming up . I wanted him to meet my family .
 I 'II meet someone else . There 'II be other Alans .
 Yeah , right !

 Are you guys gonna be okay ?
 We 'II be fine .
 We 're just gonna need a Iittle time .
 I understand .
 I 'm reaIly sorry .
 I mean , I 'm sorry too .
 But I 'm a Iittle relieved .
 Relieved ?
 WeIl , I mean , I had a great time with you .
 I just can 't stand your friends .
 Remember when we went to CentraI Park and rented boats ?
 That was fun .
 He could row Iike a Viking .
 So how 'd it go ? You know .

 Did he mention us ?
 He says he 's reaIly gonna miss you guys .
 Rough day , huh ?
 You have no idea .
 Come here .
 That 's it . I 'm getting cigarettes .
 I don 't care !
 I 'm weak ! I 've gotta smoke ! I 've gotta have the smoke !
 If you never smoke again , I 'II give you $ 7000 .
 Yeah , aII right .
