 It 's absolutely intolerable .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Quite so , Minister .
 Each separate department about to order different word- processing equipment , and I persuaded them to place one big central order for everyone - big enough for UK manufacturers to invest in systems development .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - I don 't have to tell you .
 No , Minister .
 Months of negotiation and we were on the eve of a press announcement :
 " Hacker 's massive investment in modern technology . "
 " Jim 's vote of confidence in British industry . " " ' Britain can make it , ' says Jim . "
 Quite so .
 And now this directive from Brussels saying all EEC members must conform to some niggling European word- processing standards ; that we have to agree to the plans of committees at the forthcoming European Word- Processing Conference in Brussels .

 Well , say something !
 - Yes , Minister . - Quite so .

 Is that all ?
 I 'm afraid that 's the penalty we pay for pretending we 're Europeans .
 I fully understand your hostility to Europe .
 I 'm not like you , Humphrey .
 I 'm pro- Europe , just anti- Brussels .
 I sometimes think you 're anti- Europe and pro- Brussels .
 I 'm neither pro - nor anti - anything .
 I 'm merely a humble vessel for the fruits of your deliberations .
 It could be argued that given the absurdity of the European idea , that Brussels does its best to defend the indefensible
 - and make the unworkable work .
 - That 's not true , Humphrey !
 Without sounding pompous , we must avoid narrow national self- interest .
 - It doesn 't sound pompous ... - Good .
 Merely inaccurate .
 Listen , humble vessel ,
 Europe is a community of nations dedicated towards one goal .
 May we share the joke ?
 Minister , let 's look at this objectively .
 It 's a game played for national interests .
 Why did we go into it ?
 To strengthen the free Western nations .
 We went in to screw the French by splitting them from the Germans .
 - Why did the French go in ?
 - To protect their farmers from competition .
 - And the Germans ?
 - To cleanse themselves of genocide and apply for re- admission to the human race .
 I 've never heard such cynicism !
 The small nations didn 't join for selfish reasons .
 Really ?
 Luxembourg is in it for the perks .
 The EEC capital , all that foreign money pouring in .
 A sensible central location .
 With the administration in Brussels and the Parliament in Strasbourg ?
 Minister !
 It 's like having the Commons in Swindon and the Civil Service in Kettering !
 Why do other nations try to get in ?
 Take the Greeks ...
 I find it difficult to take the Greeks , open- minded as I am about foreigners .
 They 'll want an olive mountain and a retsina lake .
 I don 't accept this !
 I 'm sorry .
 I suppose some of your best friends are Greeks ?
 ( MlNISTER ) Very droll .
 The problem isn 't internationalism but too much bureaucracy .
 The bureaucracy is a consequence of the internationalism .
 Why else is there an English Commissioner , a French Director- General below him , an Italian Chef- du- Division and so on ?
 - It 's like the Tower of Babel . - I agree .
 - Like the United Nations .
 - I agree .
 If I may interject ?
 You are in fact in agreement .
 ( BOTH ) No , we 're not .
 They say the average Common Market official has the organising ability of the Italians , the flexibility of the Germans , the modesty of the French , the imagination of the Belgians , the generosity of the Dutch and the intelligence of the Irish !
 - It 's all a gravy train !
 - How do you mean ?
 They live on champagne and caviar . Chauffer- driven Mercedes , private aeroplanes .
 Every official has his snout in the trough , and most of them their trotters as well !
 Oh , I beg to differ . Brussels is full of hard- working public servants enduring exhausting travel and tedious entertainment .
 Working their way through smoked salmon , forcing back all that champagne !
 - You 're blaming the wrong people .
 - What do you mean ?
 One of your Cabinet colleagues warned Brussels of your plan for bulk buying , which is why the directive appeared so quickly .
 Cabinet colleagues ? Don 't tell me !
 Bloody Corbett again !
 When I think of Corbett , I warm to Judas Iscariot !
 Yes , it was the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry .
 Treacherous , disloyal , arrogant , self- opinionated , publicity- seeking creep !
 I 'm sorry if that sounds harsh .
 Compared to what his Permanent Secretary says , that 's a generous tribute .
 - How did he do it ?
 - Who knows ?
 The evening paper , Minister .
 Whenever Corbett comes near me , I feel stabbing pains in the back .
 Why did you give me this , Bernard ?
 - Just there . - Oh , yes .
 Good God !
 Cabinet reshuffle !
 " It 's rumoured that the PM will announce important Cabinet changes
 " before the end of the present session . "
 Why didn 't I know about this ?
 How do they know ?
 Is this true ?
 I 'm only a humble civil servant , I do not move in such exalted circles as Cabinet Ministers and journalists .
 - But is it true ? - Yes .

 How do you know ?
 I mean , it 's true that it 's rumoured .
 A Cabinet reshuffle !
 I 've hardly started to do the things that I ... we ...
 Perhaps you won 't be moved , Minister . Ah ...
 If I 'm not , it means my career isn 't moving forward as it should .
 At least it 's not moving backwards .
 Backwards ?
 You don 't mean ... ?
 Good God !
 But I ...
 It 's not ...
 I mean , it 's ...
 I 've been doing all right , haven 't I ?
 - We 've done all right ?
 - You 've done all right .
 - We 've done all right ? - Yes , Minister .
 I may not be the outstanding success of this administration , but I 'm not a failure .
 - You 've done all right .
 - I 've been quite successful .
 If Martin were moved to the Treasury , I could get the Foreign Office !
 Perhaps you might .
 - You don 't sound very certain . - I 'm not .
 - What have you heard ?
 - Nothing , it 's why I 'm not certain .
 - Why does Bob Carver know ?
 - Perhaps he has the PM 's ear .
 - He 's in the PM 's pocket .
 - Then the PM must have a large ear .
 Right , well ...
 Let 's not worry about it any more .
 - We 'll say no more about it . - Yes , Minister .
 I mean , no , Minister .
 There 's no point worrying about it , is there ?
 - Nothing to worry about , is there ? - No , Minister .
 Shall we attend the Brussels conference ?
 We should .
 But if the PM should move Fred ... ?
 Shall we attend the conference in Brussels ?
 - What ?
 - Word- processing . Ah !
 Well , does it take place before or after the reshuffle ?
 - Who can say ? - Well , no .
 I 've known this happen before .
 One day you 're out of your office , the next you 're out of office .
 This is no time for an idiotic foreign junket !
 Minister , you mustn 't allow the reshuffle to prey on your mind .
 It 's not preying on my mind .
 - I 'm not thinking any more about it . - Splendid .
 Meet me at 6 o 'clock in the House of shuffles ... cards ...
 Commons .
 - Good evening , Sir Humphrey . - Good evening , Major .

 Arnold , when will we know about the reshuffle ?
 A little while yet .
 Any news yet about my department ?
 I 'm only Cabinet Secretary , not political correspondent of the New Standard .
 But how does my Minister stand ?
 I think the PM feels he 's done all right .
 But there 's been an interesting development .
 - Mmm ?
 - Mmm .
 Aahh !
 What ?
 Brussels have asked if he 'd be available for the next commissionership , if he wanted it .
 After all , he 's a good European .
 In strict confidence , of course .
 Is he being gently eased out ?
 Sir Humphrey , Sir Arnold .
 There you are , Bernard . Right .
 Would you like a coffee , Bernard ?
 - Thank you .
 - Pull up a chair .
 Well , Bernard , how do you feel about having a new Minister ?
 - You mean , he 's ...
 - No , Sir Humphrey is conjecturing .
 Ah , of course , I 'd be very sorry .
 Er ... Why ?
 Wouldn 't you ?
 Of course not !
 - But he 's getting a grip on the job . - Exactly !
 Ministers with a grip on the job are a nuisance .
 - They argue .
 - All Ministers argue .
 If they have a grip on the job , there 's a real danger they 'll be right .
 One tells them something is impossible and they dig out an old paper in which one had said it was easy - very tedious .
 Once they 've gone , one can wipe the slate clean and start with a new boy .
 Wonderful things , reshuffles .
 And Prime Ministers like them too .
 Fresh , decisive , keeps everyone on the hop .
 Only Ministers panic about them .
 Wouldn 't it be interesting if Ministers were fixed and Permanent Secretaries were shuffled around .
 That , Bernard , would strike at the very heart of the system that has made Britain what she is today .
 Power goes with permanence .
 - Impermanence is impotence .
 - Rotation is castration .
 It 's time they all had a little spin .
 Yes , but surely in a democracy ...
 Thank you , Bernard , that 'll be all .
 - Yes , but I 've only ...
 - Thank you , Bernard .
 Yes , thank you , Sir Humphrey .
 Good night , Sir Arnold .
 If your Minister does take Brussels , I wouldn 't get out the champagne too soon .
 - What do you mean ?
 - There is talk of his possible successor .
 Who ?
 I don 't know how to put this , but , well ... ... Basil Corbett .
 What 's the matter , darling ?
 Jim ?
 - Jim !
 - I 'm sorry .
 - Something wrong ?
 - No , nothing , really .
 Something is .
 The papers are full of a reshuffle .
 - Are they true ? - I don 't know .
 - You 're in the Cabinet .
 - We 're the last to find out .
 - Can 't you ask the PM ? - Of course not .
 - Why not ?
 - Well ...
 I just can 't .
 - It would look as if I were insecure . - I see .
 I don 't know whether it 's good or bad news , whether I 'm up or down .
 Or round and round .
 I don 't know whether I 'm a success or failure .
 - What do you think ?
 - I think you 've done all right .
 - Is that good enough ?
 - I don 't know .
 - I don 't know , is it ?
 - I don 't know .
 It 's difficult to tell . The PM might think I 've been too successful .
 You know , a challenge to the leadership .
 You ? !
 No , not me , but Martin with my support .
 If the PM is standing by to repel boarders , and Martin can 't be got rid of safely , which he can 't as Foreign Secretary , I 'm the obvious one for demotion .
 - Isolate Martin .
 - Where would you be sent ?
 There 's no shortage of useless non- jobs .
 Lord President , Lord Privy Seal ...
 Minister of Sport ... ... with special responsibility for droughts and floods .
 Maybe you 'll get promotion , darling .
 Maybe ...
 Don 't forget there 's Basil Corbett .
 - He 's out to get me . - To get everyone .
 He 's a smooth- tongued , hard- nosed , cold- eyed , two- faced creep .
 Why 's he so successful ?
 Because he 's a smooth- tongued , hard- nosed , cold- eyed , two- faced creep .
 - Apart from that ?
 - He looks OK on TV .
 - So do you !
 - Do I ?
 - Yes !
 - Really mean that ?
 - Yes .
 - What a nice thing to say !
 I 've got to elbow Corbett or he 'll elbow me .
 Elbows , the most important weapon in a politician 's armoury .
 - Other than integrity .
 - Integrity ? !
 ( TELEPHONE RlNGS )
 Yes ?
 Who 's speaking ? Hold on .
 It 's Gaston Larousse from Brussels .
 From Brussels ?
 Bonsoir , Commissionaire ... Commissar ...

 Si ...
 That 's very interesting .
 I shall need a little time to think about it .
 I 'm very honoured .
 Does Numero Dix know you 're talking to me about this ?
 Number 10 .
 Downing Street .
 I see ...
 Tell you what , give me your home telephone number .
 Yes ...
 I 'll give you a ring very soon .
 Thank you very much , goodbye .
 What was that ?
 - I don 't know .
 - What do you mean ?
 They want my name put forward as one of Britain 's commissioners for the EEC .
 - What does it mean ?
 - Living in Brussels .
 No , I mean , what does it mean ?
 Number 10 knows , so is it a plot to ease me out ?
 Is it just a coincidence ?
 What does it mean ?
 Is it a hint ?
 Is the PM giving me a face- saving exit ?
 Or was the post coming up anyway ?
 It 's a great honour ... in a way .
 - Is it a good job ? - Terrible .

 It 's curtains as far as British politics is concerned .
 It 's worse than a peerage .
 Absolute failure , total failure .
 You 're reduced to forming a new party if ever you want to get back .
 What does the job involve ?
 You 're at the heart of that ghastly Brussels bureaucracy , the gravy train .
 50, 000 a year salary , 20, 000 a year expenses .
 Champagne , lobsters , foreign travel , luxury hotel ... ... private limousines , private aircraft ... ... siestas in the afternoon ... ... long weekends at Knocke- le- Zoute ...

 - We should go over and have a look . - Why not ?
 Sometimes we deserve a bit of failure .
 Going to be a reshuffle , sir ?
 Yes , I suppose you saw that in the Standard .
 - Yes , sir .
 - So did I , actually .
 I first heard it a couple of weeks ago , sir .
 - Did you ? - Yes , sir .
 So did I , really .
 Where did you hear it ?
 - All the drivers knew .
 - How ?
 From the PM 's driver .
 - The Cabinet Secretary 's driver . - Oh , yes .

 - What else did they hear ?
 - Just the usual .
 Corbett 's in line for promotion , PM can 't overlook him .
 Apparently , old Fred - the Employment Secretary , sorry , sir - he 's going to get kicked upstairs .
 - How do they know ?
 - His driver 's been re- assigned .
 What 's the gossip about me ?
 Well , nothing really , sir .
 - Nothing ? - No .
 We don 't know what to make of that .
 - You 'll know , won 't you , sir ?
 - Yes , of course .
 Sometimes it 's difficult to know about oneself .
 You , know , just how successful ...
 What do your mates say ... about ... ?
 They all think you 've done all right , sir .
 - I 'm in a bit of a quandary .
 - Can I help , Minister ?
 It 's this reshuffle that 's on the cards .
 That 's very witty , Minister !
 I 'm sorry , I thought you were making a ...
 Do please carry on .
 To complicate matters , I 've been asked to be an EEC Commissioner .
 - Very nice .
 - Is it nice , Bernard ?
 Bernard , tell me , quite frankly ... ... as Minister here , do you think I 've done all right ?
 You 've done all right .
 Humphrey 's blocked me on so many issues .
 He 's never really been on my side .
 To be honest , " all right " isn 't really good enough , is it ?
 Well , it 's ... all right .
 Have you ... er ... heard anything ... on the grapevine ?
 About you ?
 Nothing really , Minister , no .
 Only that the British Commissioner in Europe sent a telegram to the FCO and the Cabinet Committee on Europe .
 The idea for you to be a Commissioner came from Brussels , but it is a Prime Ministerial appointment .
 The PM discussed it with the Foreign Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary and cleared the way for you to be sounded out .
 As it 's believed at Number 10 and Number 11 that you might accept , a colleague has been sounded outabout becoming Minister here .
 I 'm afraid that 's all I know .
 No more than that ?
 Which colleague has been sounded out to take my place ?
 Bernard , if I were not to go to Europe ...
 No , if I were not to go to Europe , would I go up or down ?
 No , if I did go ...
 ( BUZZER )
 Time for your meeting with Sir Humphrey , Minister .
 - Yes , fine .
 - What 's it about ?
 The visit to the word- processing conference .
 The word- processing conference ?
 Humphrey , you 'll be pleased to hear that I 've changed my mind ,
 I shall be going to Brussels after all .
 You 're resigning from the Department ? !
 No , I 'm talking about this word- processing conference .
 - I see .
 - I would like to see Brussels .
 - Why ? - Why not ?
 Why not , indeed , but why ?
 - I 'm a curious person .
 - You certainly are .
 I 've been a little hasty .
 Your arguments on behalf of Brussels were thoroughly convincing .
 Minister , I 've been reflecting on your views , and I find wisdom in your criticism of Brussels .
 - You implied it is corrupt and ...
 - No , no , no .
 - Minister , please ... - No , Humphrey .
 It is you who have convinced me .
 I 'm now convinced that Brussels is full of dedicated men , all bearing a heavy burden of travel and entertainment .
 They need all that luxury .
 The odd drinky !
 Caviar and champagne , private planes , air- conditioned Mercedes ?
 It oils the diplomatic wheels .
 Snouts in the trough .
 - That 's not an attractive phrase . - I 'm sorry . I can 't think where I picked it up !
 We 'll all go to this conference , agreed ?
 - Is your change of heart due to my arguments ? - Of course .
 It 's nothing to do with the rumour of you being offered a post in Brussels ?
 That thought is not worthy of you .
 There is such a thing as integrity .
 Oh , yes , thank you .
 Corbett !
 You can 't let someone like Corbett ...
 ( You simply can 't let Corbett loose on the department . ) ( It 'd be disastrous .
 Everything one says to Corbett ) ( appears in the Sun the next morning . )
 Glad to know you read the Sun .
 You must stop it , Arnold , I implore you .
 I 'm not the Prime Minister .
 It is really you who arranges the reshuffles .
 No , if there 's an appointment the PM is set on , the Cabinet Secretary must reluctantly acquiesce .
 You do keep your hand on the tiller .
 If Hacker decides to turn down Brussels , it would be easier to keep Corbett away from your department .
 This is the trouble , he 'll take Brussels .
 - Oh . - Yes , I know .
 He says he believes in the European ideal .
 Yes , I know , I know .
 Politicians get taken in by their own speeches .
 This is partly your fault .
 You 've blocked Hacker time and again .
 Only in the interests of good government , Arnold . Quite .
 But what you need is for Hacker to have a big success in the next few days .
 - A big success ? - Yes .
 The next few days ?
 That would give me , give the PM , a good case for keeping him here .
 Then , we might be able to move Corbett to Employment .
 Is Fred definitely going ?
 Yes , he keeps falling asleep in Cabinet .
 I thought they all did .
 Yes , but not while they 're actually talking .
 - Ah , Humphrey !
 Any news ?
 - Of what , Minister ?
 - The Cabinet reshuffle . - No .
 Didn 't you have lunch with the Cabinet Secretary ?
 - Yes .
 - What came up ?
 Nothing as yet !
 All I know is the reshuffle will be announced on Monday .
 - Have you any news ?
 - Of what ?

 The Commissionship .
 Are you going to Brussels ?
 Well ...
 Speaking with my Parliamentary hat on , I don 't think it would be a good idea .
 With my Cabinet hat on , it would be a good idea .
 Again , with my party hat on , there could be arguments on both sides .
 Which hat are you talking through now ?
 - Have you decided about going to Brussels ?
 - Yes and no .
 - What are the pros and cons , Minister ?
 - I don 't know .
 I haven 't said this before , but it depends on whether I 've done all right .
 What do you think ?
 ( BOTH ) You 've done all right .
 If I 've done all right , that 's all right ,
 I shall stay because I 'll be all right .
 But if I 've only done all right , to stay would be wrong , right ?
 Minister , to be on the safe side , you need a big success .
 - Yes .
 - A triumph , in fact .
 You need some personal publicity for some great political achievement .
 - What have you in mind ?
 - I 'm trying to think of something .
 Thank you , that 's a great help .
 What 's the purpose ?
 Something did come up at lunch .
 Sir Arnold feels that with this triumph , the PM couldn 't move you downwards , and Bernard and I might have the good fortune of you staying on with us .
 So there 's no chance of moving up ?
 Ooh ...
 Sadly , Minister , alas .
 - One must be a realist . - Oh , well .

 That 's it , it 's got to be Brussels .
 No , wait a minute .
 I 've got an idea .
 Supposing you ignore the EEC .
 Publish your own plans for word- processing machines ... ... with big orders for British manufacturers ... ... starting immediately .
 Tomorrow .
 Certainly before Monday .
 Involving more jobs , more investment .
 - More export orders . - More votes .
 Yes , when the time comes .
 - We can 't defy an EEC directive .
 - It isn 't a directive .
 It hasn 't been ratified , it 's merely a request .
 We can 't stab our partners in the back and spit in their face .
 You can 't stab anyone in the back while spitting in their face .
 On the other hand , defying Brussels would be ...
 Very popular !
 And prove I had elbows .
 What ?
 Elbows , elbows !
 - But ...
 - But what ?
 I 'd have to give up all that ...
 - Trough .
 - Right .
 When it comes down to it , one 's own country must come first .
 How true .
 And , although , strictly , this isn 't a Government matter ,
 I , personally , would be deeply sorry to lose you .
 Really , Humphrey , is that true ?
 Yes , I mean that , Minister , most sincerely .
 I suppose we have got fond of one another .
 - In a way . - In a way , yes .
 Like a terrorist and his hostage .
 Which is the terrorist ?
 ( BOTH ) He is !
 Right , OK , Bernard , that 's the decision .
 Inform the press !
 Tell me , Humphrey , who would have got my position if I 'd gone to Brussels ?
 I don 't know ...
 Didn 't you tell me it was Basil Corbett ?
 Basil Corbett ? !
 I see , Basil Corbett .
 Yes , Minister .
