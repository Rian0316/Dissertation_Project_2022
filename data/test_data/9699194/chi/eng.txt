 Can I kiss you ?
 Kiss me harder .

 Where 's Otis ?
 I think I might have killed him .

 [ alarm clock buzzing ]

 Hey , Dad .
 Oh , hey ! Great hat .
 Good morning , Jeanie .
 All right , let 's get out of here , huh ?
 - [ Otis ] Yeah .
 - [ trunk opens ]
 So , uh , where 's your mate ?
 [ Otis ]
 Uh , he should be here .
 - You know , on time is ... - Late .
 - Right . - [ Eric ] Hey !
 - [ Otis ] Hey , dude . - Sorry , packing disaster .
 - All right . - Hey , Jean .
 - Hi , Eric . - What are you wearing ?
 What are you wearing , bruv ?
 And you 've got ... Why have you got a laptop charger ?
 - We 're just going to a campsite , right ? - No , we 're in a forest .
 We 're hiking , I told you .
 So , I shouldn 't have worn espadrilles then ?
 Eric , you 're gonna go into the woods a boy and you 're gonna come out a man of nature .
 Mark my words .
 - [ laughs ] Come on , let 's go ! - Come on , let 's hit it .
 - You will take care of them , won 't you ? - [ Remi ] Oh , relax , Jeanie .
 He is perfectly safe in my hands .
 Trust me .
 Now , let 's burn some rubber .
 Should we play some tunes ?
 - Yeah . - Yeah ?
 Come on , DJ Remi on the decks and that . What you saying ?
 [ Remi ] How about this ?
 - [ " Dance Hall Days " by Wang Chung playing ] - Awesome .
 [ laughs ]

 Have you told Maeve you can 't see her anymore yet ?
 Ola won 't speak to me until I do .
 - I don 't want to hurt her .
 - [ Remi ]
 So , who 's Maeve ?
 Hmm ?
 - No one . - Well , I mean ...
 She 's ... she 's a friend .
 Uh- huh .

 - Ready ? Give me your cheeks again . - [ door opens ]
 Do that .
 Do it to me .
 [ Erin sighs ]
 I love a makeover .
 - You want me to paint your nails , Froggy ?
 - No , thanks .
 Look what I ordered .
 Ta da !
 [ laughs ]
 It 's for Jonathan .
 To say thank you for all the babysitting Cynthia has yet to agree to .
 - She 's gonna love me .
 - That 's emotional manipulation . I know .
 I 'm an evil genius .
 Do that .
 [ Erin ] I 've got an NA meeting today .
 - It 's a friends- and- family session .
 - That 's really good .
 I was hoping you could come .
 I 've got work to do .
 Please come .
 I want you to see how well I 'm doing .

 - [ Viv ] Nice house . - Hello .
 - You 're studying on the weekend , that 's ... dedicated .
 - Hi .
 - We 're actually rehearsing his lines for ... - Shakespeare .
 Uh , Viv is helping me with my Shakespeare essay for English .
 So , um , yeah . Cool .
 We 're gonna go study now .
 - You 've met , right ? - We 've literally just said hello .
 She 's nice . She 's really smart .
 What was that about ?
 Yeah , I haven 't told them about the play yet .
 My mum wouldn 't get it .
 Anyway , talk to me about Dex .
 [ both chuckle ]
 - What do your friends think of him ?
 - I don 't have time for friends , but I can be more social once I get in to university .
 [ chuckles ]
 You do know a boyfriend is like a friend , right ?
 Yeah , but Dex is busy too .
 Our schedules are very compatible .
 - Okay , all right . Tell me about him .
 - Well , he 's the 34th fastest Rubik 's Cuber in the world .
 He likes BBQ flavored Doritos .
 He bites his bottom lip when he thinks about something really difficult .
 And he 's spoken to me exactly 26 times , using a total of 556 words .
 Right , okay .

 I meant , what does he like to do in his spare time ?
 Oh , he works at Pegasus Hobbies and Games at the weekend . Why ?

 Oh , yeah . All the time . My wife Delilah and I , we ...

 Wow .
 That 's , like , so pretty .
 - [ Remi ] Yeah . - Uh ...
 I think ... it 's a crow .
 Well , this looks like an all right place to camp .
 Yeah , it 's got good ley lines , you know .
 What ?

 [ Remi ]
 Mmm .
 Here . Get your laughing gear around this baby .
 - Keep yourself warm .
 - Okay , I don 't think we should drink , - whilst we hike , Dad .
 It 's stupid . - [ Eric coughs ]
 Is he always like this ?
 Do try and relax , Otis .
 - I think we should get our first hike in right now .
 - Try and relax , dude .
 - I 'm relaxed , shut up .
 - I 'm relaxed .
 Well , I mean , we should set up the tents first .
 No , I think it 's time we try to access our inner wild man .

 - Yeah ? - Yeah .
 Good lad .
 I think we should get drunk with your dad .

 Oh , hi . Front door was open .
 I 'm making you a new pan shelf .

 Think you could keep it down ?
 Yeah , sure .
 I 'll just use my silencer .

 Okay .

 Okay , too much . Too much . Reign it in .

 - be calm , be confident . - Bev .
 - Hi . - Whoa .

 Honestly , don 't worry about it , Bev .
 It 's fine . It happens all the time .
 You keep calling her " Bev . "

 I 'm so sorry .
 I did know that . I 'm just terrible with names .

 Well , uh ... what can I help you with , Viv ?

 Oh , I love that game , but we 've just sold our last one .
 - [ inhales ]
 Shit . - [ Dex ]
 Tell you what , maybe I could take your number down , and I can let you know when it comes back in stock .
 Yeah .
 That 's me .

 Staring at me .

 That 's my biggest regret .
 Well , thank you for sharing , Nathan .
 That was ... very touching .
 I 'd like to share .
 [ clears throat ]
 - I 'm Erin and I 'm an addict . - [ man ] Hello .
 [ Erin ] I 've been clean for 13 months now .
 And , you know , every day is a struggle .
 This is my daughter , Maeve , here too .
 She 's very angry with me , but I understand her anger , and I want her to know it 's okay to blame me because so much of her pain is my fault .

 But I also want her to know that life hasn 't been easy for me either .
 I have ended up in many bad situations in my life , but I was just doing the best that I could with the tools I had at the time .
 Maeve ...
 I will never forgive myself for abandoning you and your brother .
 And I just hope ... you 'll be able to find it in yourself to forgive me .
 You 're unbelievable .
 - What 's wrong ? - It 's all about you , isn 't it , Erin ?
 That wasn 't an apology .
 That was just another excuse .
 [ sighs ]
 You don 't end up in bad situations .
 You make bad choices .
 [ man ] Hey , body slammer . What you doing here ?
 - [ thud ] - Oh , dear .
 - Can you give me a hand , please ? - Why would I do that ... sucker ?
 Come on . It was pretty funny .
 You don 't laugh much , do you ?
 Always so serious in the face department .
 Is that your
 What 's this for ?
 Well , come and have a look if you like .
 I 'm not interested .
 Except you kind of are .
 I 'm not .
 - [ thud ]
 - [ Isaac ] Oops .
 Yeah , it might be easier if you just carry them inside for me .

 [ Isaac ] My brother and I , we teach this class once a week .
 - Where did you guys learn how to dance ? - Yeah , you know , around and about .
 Happened in the army . Second tour of Afghanistan .
 My tank was attacked by a pack of wild dogs .
 - I am lucky to be alive . - I didn 't ask .
 But you really , really want to .
 I don 't feel sorry for you .
 - I need a partner . - Perfect .
 Jerry , meet Maeve .
 No , I can 't dance .
 Right . Hands the hips now , Jerry . It 's not the 1960s anymore .
 This week 's focus is on the pleasure points inside the vagina .
 Now , the primary pleasure point , if you want to refer to your leaflets , yes , is the clitoris , which can be found at the crest of the labia majora .
 Behold , the clitoris .
 [ laughs ]
 Well , it doesn 't actually come out , but , um ...
 - Yes .
 - Oh , yes , I was wondering ... if your bike has been sitting in the garden for six years , it 's probably going to be quite rusty , isn 't it ?
 Is the bike in question your vagina ?
 Yes .
 What I 'm asking is , if you haven 't been touched in a long time , are you still going to feel anything ?
 I can assure you , vaginal pleasure does not diminish with age or lack of contact .
 [ exhales ]
 In fact , there are many ways that we ... [ drill whirring ]

 Come and see me afterwards .
 Guys , do you think maybe we should head back ?
 No , Otis . It 's your go .
 - I don 't want to play .
 - Okay . Never have I ever had to choose between my girlfriend and the girl I 'm secretly in love with .

 Oh !
 Oh .
 Oh , is this about the mysterious Maeve , huh ?
 Oh , come on , Otis . Open up to your old man .
 - [ Otis ] We 're friends .
 - [ Remi ] Mm- hmm . I used to like her more than that .
 Um ...
 She didn 't feel the same way , but now she told me she has feelings for me .
 And my girlfriend kind of found out .
 - Uh- oh .
 - So , uh ... now I have to choose between ... cutting Maeve out my life or losing my girlfriend .
 [ Remi ] Yeah , I was in a similar situation once .
 It 's a difficult decision , but the heart ... wants what it wants .
 Is that what happened with Mum ?
 Yeah , and sometimes you ... you 're just with the wrong person , Otis .
 Uh ...
 - Yeah , um ... - Everything all right , Dad ?
 Yeah , just , uh , you know , just getting my ... my bearings .
 This is faulty . Have you got a map ?
 Mm- hmm .
 Um , do you want to use my phone ?
 No , a map is just fine .
 Yeah .
 Uh ...
 This way .
 Yeah , it is definitely this way .
 Maybe the drinking was a bad idea .
 [ thunder rumbling in the distance ]

 Have you ever had a weird dream ?
 [ cash register beeping , tray opens ]
 Oi !
 - I 'm talking to you . - I don 't dream .
 - Everyone dreams . - No , I 've smoked too much weed .
 What about a sex dream ?
 - About another guy ? - Look , I said I don 't dream . Okay ?
 I had a sex dream last night about a girl .
 Even though we didn 't actually have sex , we just kissed .
 - I just can 't stop thinking about it .
 - Dreams aren 't real .
 That 's why they 're called dreams .
 Do you think it means something if I 'm having sex dreams about girls ?
 I don 't know .
 Go and ask Google like everyone else .
 You didn 't answer my question before .
 Where 'd you learn to dance ?
 Well , we lived with this lady for a bit , ex- ballroom champion .
 She was horrible , but she had rhythm , so ...
 What do you mean " for a bit " ?
 Foster families never keep the disabled kid around too long .
 Make a sad face and I will ram you .
 [ chuckles ]
 I keep seeing your mum coming in and out of NA .
 She looks like a character .
 [ chuckles ]
 Yeah , well , that 's none of your business .
 Cynthia said that she pissed off a few years ago .
 - Junkies are the worst . - She 's been clean for two years .
 Yeah , we 've all heard that one before .
 You don 't know me ... or my mum , okay ?
 Oh , I thought we we 're going to bond .
 Orphan to orphan .
 Well , you were wrong .
 Hey , I didn 't mean to cross a line . I 'm sorry .
 Maybe your mum 's different . I mean ...
 Nothing changes , if nothing changes , right ?
 Did you just make that up ?
 No . That 's the quote they use on their poster .
 I think it should say , " Once an addict ... " always an addict . "
 You 're a real dick , you know ?

 Who do you notice more when you walk down the street ?
 Men or women ?
 Both .
 - I thought everyone did .
 - Well , I only notice girls .
 They 're everywhere .
 Um ...
 I 'm a pansexual , apparently .
 What , like ... fucking pots and pans ?
 I knew a guy who ... used to like to stick his dick in the suction pipe of a vacuum cleaner .
 It 's normal .
 Pansexual means that you 're attracted to the person , not the sex or gender .
 Uh , it 's about the connection you have with the human being , not with their genitalia .
 Huh .
 Kind of makes sense , actually .
 It doesn 't make sense to me .
 [ knocking at door ]
 [ exhales ]
 You were supposed to be here three hours ago .
 Yeah , I walked .
 I 'm really enjoying walking at the moment .
 It 's so evaporating .
 - Invigorating ?
 - Yeah . That 's what I said .
 [ exhales ]
 [ seductive music playing on stereo ]
 Oh , sorry .
 That was an accident .
 [ chuckles ]
 Okay .
 Ah ...
 Do you not want me to ?
 What makes you think I don 't ?
 - You keep slapping me in the head .
 - Maybe we can watch a film or something ?
 Yeah .
 Are you sure everything 's okay ?
 I feel like you 've been acting a bit strange since what happened with the bus .
 - Do you want to talk about it ?
 - I 'm fine , Steve .
 I 'm just tired from my walk .
 Go and get the laptop .
 [ shower running ]
 [ buzzing ]
 Ah ...
 [ breathing deeply ]
 [ Jackson ] ... there 's something to be jealous of .
 - So , when he texts you ... - He won 't text me .
 He will definitely text you .
 And you will definitely make him wait at least two and a half hours for a response .
 - Why so much game playing ?
 - Only at the start .
 Eventually , you will just like each other for your personalities .
 When have you ever liked anyone for their personality ?
 I did .
 I liked someone quite a lot .
 Yeah , I 'm sure that you 're pining over Maeve Wiley 's love of feminist literature .
 It had nothing to do with the size of her boobs .
 Why are you so chippy ?
 Because guys like you never see girls like me .
 All your conquests look like they 've been made in lab .
 It 's transparent .
 I really liked Maeve , you know .
 What was it about her that you liked so much ?
 It 's just the feeling , isn 't it ?
 I can 't really explain it .
 " Love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind , and therefore , is winged Cupid painted blind . "
 - - Yeah , you know .
 So , I 've been reading his other plays .
 Not sure about all the pixie stuff , but he 's all right .
 I think you should tell your mum that you 're in a school play .
 She 'll be really proud .
 Sorry , did you just give me a compliment just then ? Or ...
 If you stop being so lazy and learn your lines .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever .
 Thank you for today .
 It 's all right .
 Bye .
 Hey , Viv ?
 Yeah ?
 I see you , by the way .
 I see a girl that gave Dex her number .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ Jackson laughs ] [ Viv ]
 See you later .
 Two and a half hours .
 [ Viv ] Okay .
 [ thunder rumbling ]
 Dad , we 're lost , all right ?
 We are not lost .
 What does the flipping map say ?
 It says it 's a cheap piece of shit .
 It is okay to admit we 're lost .
 I 'm not going to admit anything because we are not lost .
 [ Eric ] Guys !
 Guys !
 - Guys , I think I can see our stuff . - Ah , you see !
 I told you we were not lost .
 Oh , my God !
 My hat !
 All right , let 's just get these tents up .
 They are pop- up , right ?
 Yeah , you just gotta open the bag , and then , you just ...
 And then it just pops up .
 You need to take the ... strap .

 No , we 're not getting a fucking hotel .

 I haven 't got all night , though , so ...
 [ phone vibrating ]
 - Why 'd you keep ignoring Rahim ?
 - 'Cause I 'm hanging with you .
 I don 't want to be one of these people that 're suddenly obsessed - with who they 're dating .
 - Well , that 's very sweet , Eric , but why are you ignoring him ?
 Didn 't he ask you to be his boyfriend ?
 Okay .
 [ laughs ]
 I have to tell you something .
 Okay ? But you can 't be mad I didn 't say anything before .
 Do you remember I got detention last term with Adam ?
 Well ... he gave me a blowjob .
 [ laughs ]
 And since he 's been back , we 've been going on all these late- night walks where we go and smash stuff and then we kiss ... a lot and ... and it 's amazing .
 Why is your face not moving ?
 Because he ... he bullied you ...
 - for years , Eric . He 's a horrible person . - No , but people can change .
 If he 's changed , then why is he making you sneak around at night ?
 Well , it 's romantic .
 Something you wouldn 't know about because you 're too busy pretending to have feelings for your girlfriend , when everyone knows that you 're actually in love with Maeve .
 - No , take that back . - You take back what you said .
 - What about Rahim ? - Oh , my God .
 He 's not ashamed to be with you .
 - Don 't pretend to be all " Team Rahim " now . - What 's that supposed to mean ?
 I think that that is what this is really about .
 You don 't like being the one left behind for a change .
 No , Eric .
 This is about you being so self- hating that you 'd let yourself fall for someone who literally treats you like shit .
 Don 't therapize me , Otis .
 You don 't know what my reality is .
 Okay .
 Do what you want .
 Okay ?
 But ... ask yourself ... why have you really been hiding it ?
 [ Remi , shouting ] Why , Delilah ? Don 't !
 Don 't hang up !
 - [ thud ]
 - Argh !
 - I 've gotta go check on my dad .
 - Yeah , we 'll talk later .
 [ door opens ]
 [ door closes ]
 [ sighs ] Fuck .
 [ knock at door ]
 Yeah ?
 You all right , Dad ?
 Yeah , Delilah has , uh ... has left me ... for someone else .
 Oh , shit .
 I 'm sorry .
 Are you upset by that ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , um ...
 I 'm upset for you .
 ' Cause it 's ... it 's okay ... if you want to cry , Otis .
 I mean ...
 - Yeah , you know , it 's ... it 's all right ... for men to cry .
 - Yeah , I will .
 I 'm good .
 - I know . - Yeah .
 [ crying ] Oh , God .
 [ sobbing ]
 It 's ...
 [ sobbing continues ]
 What 's wrong ?
 I 'm going to kiss you .
 [ thunder rumbling ]
 Why are we at school ?
 We 're always at school .
 Where 's Otis ?
 Don 't worry ... he 's with Maeve .
 You 're safe .

 Go .

 And you came here ' cause you had nowhere else to go .

 Come here , Otis , Remi !
 Come , man !

 Good thing for insurance , eh ? [ chuckles ]
 You did get insurance , didn 't you ?
 - I don 't think he got insurance . - [ door closes ]

 [ groaning loudly ]
 No !
 [ dog whimpers ]
 [ dog whimpering ]
 [ Maureen ] Adam , could you come downstairs , please ?
 I 'm divorcing your father .
 Would you like some mango ?
 [ Otis ] I 'm sorry about what I said last night .
 I just wish you 'd told me .
 [ Eric ] I thought you 'd be judgmental .
 Yeah , you were right .
 - I just don 't want you to get hurt . - Oh .
 But if you think he 's changed , I believe you .
 I didn 't mean what I said about Ola .
 Okay , if you 're happy , then I 'm happy .
 I really thought he came back to see me this time .
 Idiot .
 Come on .
 [ Eric ] Oh , my God .
 Oh , Jesus is the Lord .
 Jesus is the Lord .
 God . Please never leave us again , Jean .
 [ Jean ]
 Oh .
 [ exhales ]
 - How was it ? - [ Otis ] Great .
 Great . We saw a nightingale .
 Oh .
 And it rained , and we got lost .
 Dad fought a tent like it was a person .
 And the nightingale was a crow .
 Yeah .
 Remi ...
 How was the trip ?
 Shit .

 - [ Ola ] Hi . - Hi .
 Shall we go inside ? Yeah .
 Uh- huh .
 Delilah called .
 You know I 'm a sex addict , Jean .
 I 'm going to get help this time .
 I want to be a good father .
 Mmm .
 To which children ?
 [ Otis ]
 Um ...
 I might take your hand , actually .
 No , wait . No . That feels weird .
 Sorry .
 Okay . Here goes .
 [ sighs ]
 [ exhales ]
 I love you .
 [ chuckles ]
 Uh ...
 I said ...
 I love you .
 Why are you laughing ?
 Because ... [ sighs ]
 ... you don 't love me .
 And I 've just realized that I definitely don 't love you .
 [ exhales ]
 I think we got it wrong .
 I think we 're supposed to be friends .
 What ?
 We 're so different , you know .
 I like to be in the moment and you 're so ... uptight .
 You said you had to think about it , and it was difficult .
 It shouldn 't be difficult , Otis . We 're 16 .
 Are you breaking up with me ?
 Yeah .
 I am .
 Ah , ah ...
 Okay , um , actually , just ... please go .
 Okay .
 I 'm really sorry , Otis .

 So , have you decided not to ignore me anymore ?
 Sorry .
 I had some stuff that I needed to think about .
 This is all new for me .

 Yes . [ laughs ]
