 00 : 00 : 01, 931 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 198 Hey , you guys ready to order ? Uh , sure . Okay , Priya ?
 Uh , I 'll have the shepherd 's pie .
 You want to split that with me ?
 Oh , no , no , no , he doesn 't .
 Why not ?
 Well , you have milk in the taters , milk in the gravy , parmesan crust .
 Your lactose- intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas- filled Macy 's Day balloon .
 ( all laugh )
 Not quite accurate .
 The Macy 's balloons are filled with helium , whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane .
 ( all laugh ) ( goofy snicker )
 So , no , on the shepherd 's pie .
 Can we move on ? Yeah , a little tip : he says he can eat frozen yogurt .
 Do not believe it .
 Sea bass !
 I 'll have the sea bass !
 You gotta like this , the girlfriend and the ex- girlfriend bonding over your rooty- tooty stinky booty .
 ( all laugh ) Kill me .
 It wouldn 't help .
 The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death .
 ( snickers )
 Guys , sorry I 'm late .
 I have amazing news .
 Bernadette , before you change the subject , does anyone have any final comments on
 Leonard 's faulty digestive system ?
 So , what 's your news , Bernadette ?
 The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation .
 I 'm getting my PhD ! Wow !
 Oh , congratulations .

 Wow , so that means you 're a doctor , you 're a doctor , you 're a doctor , you 're a doctor , and Howard , you know a lot of doctors .
 ( chuckling )
 Congratulations , honey .
 Thank you .
 So , Howard , tell us , how 's it feel knowing that when you two get married , you 'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz ?
 Unless he takes Bernadette 's last name .
 And considering her advanced status , that could open some doors for him .
 Please , this isn 't about me .
 I 'm proud of you .
 Well , you 'll be really be proud of this .
 I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company .
 They 're gonna pay me a buttload of money !
 What ? Bernadette , that 's great .
 Howard , do you make a buttload ?
 Better than what you 've got a buttload of .

 Hey , if I roll down the windows in the car , everything 's peachy . If you do it , you 're still not a doctor .
 Yeah , just a heads- up on the car window deal .
 It helps , but everything is not " peachy . "

 PRlYA :
 Oh , God , I feel ridiculous in this dress . LEONARD : You look beautiful , Lieutenant Uhura .
 ( a la Capt. Kirk ) :
 Now prepare for ... inspection . PRlYA :
 Shh , my brother 's going to hear you . LEONARD : Relax , he 's got headphones on .
 And we 're ten miles above Earth in a starship .
 Really , ten miles ?
 You 're orbiting inside the atmosphere ? Moron . PRlYA :
 I can 't believe I 'm wearing my brother 's Halloween costume .
 LEONARD :
 I can 't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween . Open the landing bay doors , shuttle craft approaching .
 Okay , gotta go .

 Hey , what 's up ?
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Is that my future daughter- in- law , the doctor ? ! No , Ma !
 It 's Raj !
 He 's a doctor too , right ? !
 Yes !
 Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo !
 Sheldon , yes !
 Everybody 's a doctor but me !
 Well , whose fault is that ? !
 What 's up ?
 Leonard 's putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress .
 Can I stay here tonight ?
 Sure , but I 'm going out with Bernadette .
 It 'll just be you and my mother . I guess that 's okay .
 Ma , can Rajesh sleep over ? !
 Of course , he and I can play doctor !

 She 's kidding , right ?
 I don 't know , she 's pretty feisty since they put her on hormone- replacement therapy .
 Paging Dr. Cutie Pie !
 I must say , Amy , I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD .
 It 's indeed admirable .
 Although , it is ... microbiology .
 Your doctorate is in neurobiology .
 I fail to see the distinction .
 I 'll make it simple for you .
 I study the brain , the organ responsible for Beethoven 's
 Bernadette studies yeast , the organism responsible for Michelob Lite .
 Is there something wrong with your neck ?
 It 's a little stiff .
 What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload .
 Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick .
 Have you considered massage ?
 I 'd like to respond to that sarcastically :
 Yes , I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it .
 I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands .
 Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching .
 Trust me .
 With your right hand , locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process .
 All right .
 Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade , making a small rotation as you do so .
 Rotating .
 You should feel a small node- like object rolling back and forth along the bone .
 You mean the myofascial point ?
 Obviously .
 Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well .
 Oh , dear Lord , yes , yes , oh , yes !
 Amy , I 've never been touched like this before !
 Oh !
 My hands are magic !
 Don 't flatter yourself .
 Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system .
 I could just as easily have paralyzed you .
 ( knocking )
 There 's someone at my door .
 That doesn 't interest me . Good- bye .


 - Can I sleep here tonight ?
 - Why ?
 Leonard 's having astronomically inaccurate
 sex with my sister .
 I can see how that would be upsetting .
 Come in . I 'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch .

 Oh , don 't bother . I 'll just sleep in Leonard 's room .
 No , I can 't authorize that .
 Well , he 's in my bed . Why can 't I be in his ?
 The Hammurabic Code is " an eye for an eye , " not " a bed for a bed . "
 Come on , dude , I 'm exhausted , and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night 's sleep .


 All right .
 This is a form indemnifying me from your use of " Leonard 's bedroom . "
 Sign here , indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression .
 Good night , Sheldon .
 Wait .
 Not yet .
 We still have to go over safety procedures .
 Now , the apartment has three emergency exits located here , here , and here .
 In the event of a power outage ,
 luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit .
 You 're kidding .

 I never kid about safety .
 ( both gasp )
 What are you doing here ?
 I was sleeping . In my bed ?
 Well , I would 've slept in my own bed , but it was being used to bring shame to my family .
 And the memory of Gene Roddenberry .
 Oh , you heard ?
 " Scotty , I need more power . "
 Sorry .
 Does Sheldon know you 're sleeping in here ?
 Are you kidding ?
 He made me sign a waiver , participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR .
 Thank God he had a dummy .
 Oh , yeah .
 Mouth- to- Mouth Mona .
 You know , she used to date Howard ?
 Oh , my God , she 's Mona ?
 Why can 't you and my sister spend your nights here ?
 We tried . She doesn 't get along with Sheldon .
 Sheldon doesn 't get along with Sheldon .
 It 's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night .
 Okay , well , how about this : until Priya gets her own place , you stay here and I 'll stay at your apartment .
 Can I bring girls here ?
 You ? Sure .
 Bring as many as you want .
 Okay , deal .
 Just not against their will .

 You really think you should be eating that cake ? Why ?
 If you 're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife , you might want to watch your waistline .
 He 's right .
 A minute on the lips , a lifetime on the hips .
 Yeah , ha- ha .
 First of all , I 'm not threatened by my fiancée 's success .
 I 'm proud of her .
 And secondly , I have my own career .
 Until you have kids .
 Good news , Raj .
 I got the blood work back from the lab .
 You 're okay to stay for a while .
 When did you take my blood ?
 Not important .
 Your sugar was a little high .
 I 'd follow up with your regular physician .
 In the meantime , I have some paperwork here for you to go over .
 What the hell is this ?
 Boilerplate stuff .
 A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest .
 And a living will and durable power of attorney .
 This says you can make nd o of li " decisions for me . As your friend , let 's hope it doesn 't come to that .
 Please sign . Did you sign this ?
 There 's a reciprocity clause .
 You get to pull the plug on him , too .
 Well , that seems fair .
 Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard .
 Here 's your I. D. card , your key and your lapel pin .
 Which Leonard was too cool to wear .
 FYl , part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work , the comic book store , the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air .
 Bring a ball or a Frisbee , you know , something he can chase .
 Also , you 're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners .
 Tonight is Thai food .
 You 'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server .
 If you have any questions , here 's the FAQ sheet , or if you prefer the human touch ,
 I do a live web chat called " Apartment Talk " on Tuesday nights .
 No backsies .
 ( romantic jazz playing )
 Sheldon , dinner !
 What is this ?
 This is the difference between eating and dining .

 Remarkable .
 I 'm just realizing how much
 Leonard 's been skating by all these years .
 It 's not a big thing .
 Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart . ( knock on door )

 Hey , Sheldon , did you change your Wi- Fi password again ?
 Yes , it 's " Penny , get your own Wi- Fi . " No spaces .
 Thanks .
 Wow !
 What 's with the fancy spread ?
 My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me .
 Uh , nice touch , by the way .
 What do you mean " new roommate " ?
 What happened to Leonard ?
 The same thing that happened to Homo erectus .
 He was replaced by a superior species .
 I 'm the new Homo in town .

 That came out wrong .
 All right , let me try this again . Where 's Leonard ?
 He 's living at my place , so I 'm living here .
 You 're living here provisionally .
 But I must say it 's looking good .
 Oh Leonard and Priya are living together ?
 That 's big . No .
 Origami napkin swans ... that 's the headline .
 It 's a good thing .
 So do you know what kind of research you 'll be doing at this pharmaceutical company ?
 Well , there are a couple of opportunities available , but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project .
 I mean , it 's not like either one of us has heart disease .
 Oh , I almost forgot .
 I got you a little present . Oh , Bernie , no .
 You didn 't have to .
 I wanted to . Come on , open it .


 You bought me a Rolex ? How much did this cost ?
 Oh , you let me worry about the money .
 I just want my baby to have pretty things .

 More wine ?
 Oh , no , no , no .
 I 've had way too much already .
 Here 's an interesting fact about alcohol ...
 Hit me . ( clears throat )

 Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated .
 Can you guess what the other is ?
 Hint : sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks .
 Monkeys .

 When does a monkey have a trunk ? When a suitcase just won 't do .

 Mmm , all right .
 It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep- away with your intelligence .
 Good night .
 Please note , it is now past 10 : 00 p . m .
 Per our roommate agreement , kindly refrain from raucous laughter , clinking of glasses , and celebratory gunfire .

 Okay ... ( clears throat ) explain something to me .
 You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years .
 What has to break inside your brain for you to think , ( with Indian accent ) :
 " Oh , Krishna , I 've got to get me some of that " ?
 Well , it 's a lot better than having to wear noise- cancelling headphones in my own apartment .
 What ? Oh , God , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Leonard 's a noisy little dude in the sack .
 Every night .
 Really ?
 Even during allergy season , when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing ?

 It 's my sister .
 Can we not talk about this anymore ?
 Yeah .
 Sorry , sorry .
 Can I tell you a secret ?
 Yeah .
 I screwed up .
 Leonard 's a great guy .
 Never should have broken up with him .
 Well , uh , to paraphrase Shakespeare : " It 's better to have loved and lost
 " than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography . "
 Ohh ... you poor baby . What 's wrong with me , Penny ?
 Nothing , nothing .
 You know , if we weren 't friends , and you hadn 't brought up that creepy pornography story ,
 I 'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy .
 Hey , you totally got that right !
 " E=mc2 . "
 I listen .
 I have no idea what it means , but I listen .
 To friendship .
 To friendship .
 ( laughs ) ( glasses clink )
 SHELDON :
 Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking ? !
 And the answer was elephant !
 ( slurping ) :
 Mmm .
 Mmm .
 Leonard , sweetheart , we 're kissing , not eating hot soup .
 Sorry .

 ( computer ringing )
 That 's my parents on video chat .
 Go hide in the bedroom . Oh , come on !
 Why don 't we just tell them that we 're dating ?
 Oh , we 've been through this . It 's not the time .
 When is the time ?
 I 've got five brothers and sisters .
 One of them is bound to screw up real big , and then I 'll tell my parents about you .
 Now , shoo .
 Fine .
 Hello , Mummy .
 Hello , Daddy .
 We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City .
 Is that close to you ?
 No .
 Where is your brother ?
 Out with friends .
 I don 't like it , a young girl alone in an apartment .
 I 'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month .
 You 're moving back to India ? !
 DR. KOOTHRAPPALl : Who 's that ? Oh , my God !
 There 's someone in your apartment .
 Call the police in America !
 When were you going to tell about this ?
 Oh , hello , Leonard .
 What a pleasant surprise !
 Mummy , Daddy , you remember Rajesh 's friend Leonard .
 I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends .
 He has many friends .
 Rajesh has many friends ?
 Why are you lying to us ?
 She 's lying because she doesn 't want you to know we 're dating .
 Leonard !
 Well , what difference does it make ?
 If you 're moving back to India , we 're obviously breaking up .
 You know what ?
 I don 't want to deal with this right now .
 ( door slams )
 So ...
 Hot in India ?
 Of course it is .
 It always is . It 's India .


 Now , what do you have to say for yourself ? Uh ...
 That is a beautiful tapestry .
 Oh , God .
 ( clears throat )
 Oh , God ! Oh .
 Okay , look . This never happened .
 Do you understand me ?

 Really ? !
 Still can 't talk to me ?

 What are you doing here ? What ?
 I said , what are you doing here ?
 I live here .
 I have paperwork that says differently .
 ( knocking on door )
 Priya 's going back to India . Irrelevant .
 Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you 're not going to ruin it .
 What are you doing here ? I 've been up all night .
 - I had a fight with Bernadette .
 - Why ?
 She gave me a beautiful watch .

 Leonard , do you understand this ? Yes .
 Talk to him .

 Damn .
 What 's going on ? Oh ... ( laughs )
 It 's- it 's not what it looks like .
 What does it look like ?
