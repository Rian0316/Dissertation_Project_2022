 - You 've read it ?
 - I 've read it .
 - Have you read this ?
 - He 's read it .
 - Let me read it to you ! - We 've read it .
 " Let 's get rid fo Jim Hacker " , by John Pilgrim .
 The Right Honourable Jim Jacker , promised to slim down the Civil Service , and to wipe out the interference from the Whitehall and Town Hall busybodies .


 But howmany people realise that more people serve in the Inland Revenue than the Royal Navy ?

 - Is it true ?
 - I believe it is , Minister .
 - " Perhaps a tax is the best defence " .
 - Oh , that 's ratherwitty .
 - And have you read this bit ?
 - I have read it .
 " No less than fourministries check the supply of the same army uniforms .
 Defence checks to see they get what they ordered .
 Industry checks to see they are manufactured as perregulations .
 The Treasury checks the bills .
 And Jim Hacker 's mob checks up on everyone else .
 Jim Hacker is the most obvious case of overmanning in Whitehall .
 Let 's get rid ofhim and save at least one salary " .
 Frank , why did you read me that ?
 I told you I 'd read it . Because I 'm yourpolitical advisor .

 This is politically damaging foryou .
 Good morning , Minister .
 - Have you read this ?
 - Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
 I have read it !
 You have read it , he has read it !
 We have all bloody read it , do I make myself clear ?
 Abundantly , Minister .
 I 'm sorry .
 Sit down .
 Humphrey , we have got to slim down the Civil Service .
 Howmany people have we got in this department ?
 This department ?
 Oh , we 're very small .
 Small ? How small ?
 I don 't know ... 2 . 000 ?

 3 . 000 ? Um ... about 23 . 000 , I think , Minister .

 23 . 000 ?
 In Administrative Affairs ?
 23 . 000 people just administering otheradministrators ?
 We 'll have to do a study to see who we can get rid of .
 - We did one of those last year .
 - And ?
 It transpired we needed another500 people .
 However , we could always close your Bureaucratic Watchdog Office .
 No .
 It 's the one thing I 've done since I got here .
 But it has been criticised as a trouble maker 's letterbox .
 I know .
 It 's very popularwith the voters .
 They help us find ways to stop wasting government money .
 We are the experts about wasting government money ...
 That 's not what I meant .
 Well , the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office stays .
 Well , offhand I can 't think of what else to suggest .
 Are you seriously telling me there is no way we can cut down ?
 I suppose we could lose one ortwo of the tea ladies .
 Oh , Humphrey , I do wish you 'd take this seriously .
 Tea ladies !
 I want the facts .
 I want to knowwho works here , what they do , what buildings we have , what goes on in them .
 Then we 'll knowwhere to cut costs , cut staff , cut procedures ...
 The Civil Service , Minister , exists to implement
 legislation enacted by Parliament .
 As long as Parliament continues to legislate , the Civil Service ...
 However , I am fully seized of yourrequirements , and I 'll go and set the wheels in motion .
 Thank you .
 - Good morning , Mr. Weasel .
 - Weisel .
 Did you know that a Regional Controller has achieved cuts of 32 million in his region alone ?
 And that the Civil Service is suppressing the story ?
 - Is it true ?
 - If it is , I 'm aghast !
 - Why ? - Lfhe can save , everyone else can .
 Why don 't you look into it , have a bit of a ferret around ?


 Do you think I could ?
 I think that 's a very good idea , Mr. Ferret erWeasel .

 - He told you 32 million pounds ?
 - Yes , Sir Humphrey .
 - I 'm aghast ! - So I was .
 It 's incredible we didn 't know about it .
 - I knew about it .
 - Then why are you aghast ?
 I 'm aghast that it got out . We 'll get less money from the Treasury next year .

 Oh , it 's afterhalf past five .
 Sherry ?
 Oh , er , yes . Thank you .
 - You still look worried , Bernard .
 - Well ... yes . I mean , surely we want to save money .
 You knowperfectly well there has to be some way to measure success in the Civil Service .
 British Leyland measure theirsuccess by the size of theirprofits , or , to be more accurate , they measure theirfailure by the size of their losses .

 We don 't have profits and losses .
 We have to measure oursuccess by the size of ourstaff and ourbudget .
 By definition , Bernard , a big department is more successful .
 Are you saying that the Regional Controller boobed by saving so much money ?
 Well , of course .
 Nobody asked him to .
 Suppose everybody did it !
 Suppose everyone went around saving money irresponsibly all overthe place .
 That 's what the Ministerwants , isn 't it ?
 Do sit down , Bernard .
 Ministers come and Ministers go .
 The average Minister lasts less than 11 months in any department .
 You see , Bernard , it is ourduty to assist the Minister to fight forthe Department 's money despite his own panic reactions .
 You mean help him overcome his panic .
 No .
 No . No .
 No , we must let him panic .
 Politicians like to panic .
 They need activity .
 It 's theirsubstitute forachievement .
 We must just ensure that it doesn 't change anything .
 But they are the people 's representatives , democratically chosen .
 MP 's aren 't chosen by the people , but by their local party .
 35 men in grubby raincoats or35 women in silly hats .
 But the government are selected from the best of them .
 Bernard , there are only 630 MP 's .
 If one partyhas just over300 it forms a government .
 Of that 300 , one hundred are too old and too silly , one hundred too young and too callow which leaves just about a hundred MP 's to fill one hundred gobernmental posts .

 There 's no choice al all .
 They 've had no selection , no training .
 We have to do the job forthem .
 But how can we explain saving 32 million to the Minister ?
 We can explain they 've changed theiraccounting systems .
 Orthat they 've redrawn the regional boundaries so that the current figures aren 't operable .
 There are all sorts of possibilities .
 I see .
 Useful chat , Bernard , good job it nevertook place .


 Yes .
 Yes .
 Of course .
 So what else is ourfriend Weasel up to ?
 Oh , he 's ferretting .
 Ferretting ?
 Where ?
 It 's a roving brief .
 Then we shall have to provide Rover with a government car .
 So thatwe 'll know where he 's digging .


 How ... how are you getting on with your Minister , Humpy ?
 Got this economising nosense undercontrol ?
 Yes , I think so , Jumbo ... more o less .
 - What do you mean more or less ?
 - Well ... yes and no .
 Presumably it 's like all the other government economy drives ?
 Three days of press releases , three weeks of memos , a crisis in the Middle East and back to normal ?
 This one 's slightly different .
 He 's beginning to see slimming down the Service as his main task .
 Dammit , we don 't need slimming !
 I think you might have to conduct anotherOperation HairShirt .
 Operation HairShirt .
 What a good idea . Guide him towards painful personal economies .
 Yes , you know .
 " Economy begins at home , Minister " .
 " Set an example , Minister " . " Can 't expect others to do what we can 't do ourselves , Minister " .
 Yes , yes .
 Just what he needs , self denial .

 Splendid .

 Right .
 Item 3 .
 The economy drive .
 Frank has come up with some startling indications of wastage in ourvery midst .
 - Has he really ?
 - You 'll be surprised .
 These facts are a frightening indictment ofbureaucratic sloppiness and self indulgence .
 Dear , dear .
 But as you 'll see , they do give us enormous scope forsome really dramatic economies .
 Good show ! Now , I have here two files : One on manpower , one on buildings .
 Let 's startwith the buildings .
 Chadwick House , West Audley Street .
 - A handful of people working there .
 - Yes , 20 ...
 I do happen to know about Chadwick House .
 - What do you know ?
 - It 's underused , but it is the office forthe new Commission forthe Environment .
 We 're wondering if it 's going to be big enough forall the staff .

 O. K. What about Ladysmith Buildings , Walthamstow .
 - Apparently that 's empty .
 - Of course .
 - What do you mean , of course ?
 - Security , I can say no more .

 Do you mean Ml6 ?


 What 's that supposed to mean ?
 We do not admit that Ml6 exists .
 - Everybody knows it exists .
 - Nevertheless , we do not admit it . Not everyone round this table has been vetted .
 I thought thatwas something you do cats .
 Yes , indeed .
 But not ferrets , Minister .
 Ladysmith House is top secret .
 How can a seven storey building in Walthamstowbe top secret ?
 Where there 's a will there 's a way .
 What about Wellington House and WestminsterOld Hall ?
 Wellington House , Hyde Park Road , estimated value 7 . 5 million pounds .
 WestminsterOld Hall , Sackville Square , estimated value 11 million pounds .
 Each building with a tiny staff , and both filled entirely with filing cabinets .
 - The source of these valuations ?
 - Going rate forproperty . But neitherof them would fetch the going rate .


 Wellington House has no fire escape orfire doors and the building wouldn 't stand the alteration .
 - It can 't be used as offices .
 - How are you able to use them ? Government buildings do not require fire safety clearance .


 Why not ?
 Well , perhaps because Her Majesty 's Civil Servants are not easily inflamed .


 What about WestminsterOld Hall ?
 Class one Registered Building .
 Can 't change current userdesignation .


 I see .
 3 to 17 Beaconsfield Street ?
 Ah , yes .
 Now , that has a three level reinforced concrete basement .
 So ?
 It is there in case .

 In case ?
 Well , you know , Minister . Emergency Government Headquarters , if and when .


 If and when what ? If and when ... you knowwhat .


 - What ?
 - If and when you knowwhat .
 I don 't knowwhat .
 What ?
 What do you mean , if and when you knowwhat ?
 When the chips are down , the balloon goes up and the lights go out ...
 There has to be somewhere to carry on government , even if everything else stops .

 Why ?
 Government doesn 't stop just because the whole country 's been destroyed .
 Annihilation 's bad enough , without anarchy to make things even worse .
 You mean you 'd have a lot of rebellions cinders ?


 Who would be there foryou to govern ?
 Well , there 're bound to be some ordinary people around .
 - What about Central Registry ?
 - No planning permission .
 How does he know all this ?
 You knewwhere I 'd been .
 Obviously we knew where he 'd been .
 Was he supposed to be spying ?
 We do believe in open enquiries , don 'twe ?
 Let us turn to manpower .
 Yes , let 's !
 Aparently there are 90 Civil Servants in Sunderland duplicating the work of 90 more here in Whitehall .
 That stems from a Cabinet decision . - Job creation in the North East .
 - Let 's get rid of them .
 We 'd get rid of 90 Civil Servants at a stroke .
 Yes , or indeed , at a strike .
 Yes . ¿ What ?
 I would be wholeheartedly in favourof such a move .
 Itwould be a splendid economy .
 And show great political courage to sack staff in depressed marginal constituencies .

 There is nowhere we can cut down .
 - I see waste everywhere .
 - I agree with you , Minister .
 - There is scope foreconomy ...
 - Well , where ? Well .
 I sometimes feel that the very way we do things is on too lavish a scale .
 You know , cars , furnishings ... entertainments , private office staff ...
 - Duplicating machines ...


 - Yes . Yes . Yes .
 Fine .
 Yes .
 That 's where we 'll start .
 - Unfortunately there is a difficulty .
 - I knew it !
 It does cause profound resentment if those at the top continue to enjoy the comforts they withdraw from those below them , not to mention the deeply damaging publicity ...


 You mean you and I should ...
 Set a personal example ?
 Economy begins at home ?
 We can 't expect others to do whatwe don 't do ourselves , can we ?
 - Would it really save all that much ?
 - Well , not directly , no . But , as an example to the whole public service ... incalculable .


 Well , I don 't know ... Jim , there 'd be a lot of great publicity in it :
 " The Ministershows the way " .
 " Slimline Government " .
 " Hackersets an example " .
 " Save it " says Jim .
 Yes .
 Yes , that 's it .
 Great , where do we start ?
 - Oh !
 Turn the ...
 - Sorry . Were you asleep ?
 Yes .

 I missed my train .
 Had to walk all the way to Euston .
 - And the chauffeurdriven car ?
 - Got rid of it .
 Got rid of the chauffeurtoo , and all that office furniture , drinks cabinet , half the staff in my private office .

 - You 've been sacked .
 - No , no ...
 - Then why ?
 - It 's an economy drive .
 I 'm setting an example . No luxuries , no frills , no privileges ...

 You 're mad ... For 20 years you 've complained you had no facilities .
 - Now you 're throwing them away .
 - But , darling ... 20 years you 've wanted to be a success .
 Why , if it brings no greater comfort than failure ?
 You don 't really understand politics .
 This way it 's going to bring me much more power in the end .
 And how are you going to travel when you are Prime Minister .

 Hitch hike ?
 - Bernard , ourdiary session .
 - As soon as I 've done this typing .
 - Can 't you get ... ?
 - Not really , it 's ratherurgent .
 And since the cutbacks there 's just the two of us .
 Well , I must talk to you .
 - Mandy !
 Mandy !
 - Yes ?
 Where 's W ?
 Top left .
 Bernard !
 Come in here !

 Now !
 I was double booked this morning .
 I was late forthat thing .
 - What thing ?
 - The Business Efficiency Exhibition !
 I do apologise , but whatwith the ... staff economies in yourprivate office , it is awfully difficult to keep track .



 - What 's happening this afternoon ?
 - I 'll get the diary .

 Not now , dear !
 Not now !
 - Morning , duck .
 - Do you have to do that now ?
 Yes . Yes .
 They 've cancelled the night shift . Some idiot 's started another of those economy drives .


 - I 'm Nellie .
 - Good .
 Well , the point is ...
 Who are you ?
 I 'm the Minister .
 Oh , really ?
 Oh , I 'm everso pleased to meet you .
 I voted foryou .
 Oh , good .
 Thank you .
 You can call me Nellie .
 Thank you .
 - What do I call you ?
 - Er ... Jim .
 Here 's the diary , Minister .
 Right .
 Turn that off , would you , dear ?
 Turn it ...
 Nellie !

 What ?
 Would you excuse us ?
 This is confidential .
 I 've got to get on you know , Jim .
 So have I.


 Jim ? Well , I won 't use the hoover .
 I 'll tiptoe , you 'll nevernotice me .
 - Go please .
 - I 'm light as a feather . Go !
 Now !
 All right , Jim .
 I can take a hint .
 It 's just Mr. Brough this morning , our Directorof Manpower Planning .
 - Brough ?
 - Yes , staff reductions .
 - Oh , yes .
 - And then straight to the House .
 At 8 o 'clock the French Prime Minister 's reception at his Embassy .
 I must take the schedules down to the Whips Office .


 - Bernard ...
 - Yes , Minister ?
 It is worth it , you know ...
 Centre page spread and three pictures .
 Yes , I have read it , Minister .

 See this one of me , with a cheese roll on a cardboard plate ?
 " No luxury lunches in Hacker 's new austerity regime " .
 " Economy begins at home " said Jim Hackertoday , as he set an example to Britain 's pampered army ofbowlerhatted bureaucrats " .


 - Terrific , isn 't it ?
 - You have read it to me already .
 - Great , isn 't it ?
 - Yes , Minister .
 Economise on the beaches ...


 - Excuse me .
 - Yes ? Yes ?
 - I 'd like to see the Minister .
 - Do you have an appointment ?
 Ron Watson , General Secretary of the Union of Civil Service Transport Workers .
 - Yes , Mr. Watson .
 - We 're disturbed about rumours of redundancies affecting ourmembers ...
 I 'm sorry , you must have an appointment .
 - Phone me tomorrow .
 - Why can 't I arrange it now ?
 - I 'm sorry .
 - Oh , really !
 Mandy , make an appointment for Mr. Watson fornextweek .

 Nextweek ?
 Hello ...
 Mr. Brough .
 Yes , we 're expecting Mr. Brough now .
 When 's it due in at Euston ?
 We 'll just have to cancel it fortoday then .
 Yes , yes , I 'll tell him .
 Goodbye .
 Sorry to keep you .
 Now , about yourappointment .
 When would be convenient ...
 - The meeting 's cancelled then ?
 - Yes .
 - So I can see him now ?
 - I 'm afraid not , you see ...
 Would you excuse me just a moment ?

 Yes ? No .
 He 's not here .
 He 's gone overto the Whips Office .
 Would you like the extension ?
 Ah , Mr ...

 Brough ?
 Mr. Brough 's had to cancel the meeting .
 My name 's Ron Watson .
 I 'm ...
 I 'm glad you could get here instead .
 - Do sit down , won 't you .
 - Oh , thank you .
 Now , Mr. Er ...
 Watson .
 Before we start there 's one thing I must make absolutely clear .
 This must not get out .
 If the unions were to get to hearof this all hell would be let loose .
 Oh , yes .
 Of course there 'll be redundancies .
 You simply ...
 You simply can 't slim down a giant bureaucracy like this without getting rid of people .
 Ultimately , a lot of people .
 Won 't you be holding discussions with the Unions first ?
 We 'll go through the charade of discussions , but you know what Trade Unionists are like ; thick as two short planks and bloody minded .

 All of them ?
 Pretty well .
 Good lord , you should know .
 They 're interested in poaching each other 's members and they can 't keep theirbig mouths shut .
 What about drivers and transport service staff ?
 First to go . We waste a fortuna on cars and drivers .
 - And they 're all on the fiddle .
 - Oh , I see .
 Because , as I was trying to explain , I 'm not Mr. Brough 's deputy .
 I 'm the General Secretary of the Union of Civil Service Transport and Associated Government Workers .


 Ah . I ...
 I came here to check there was no truth in the rumours of redundancies formy members .
 Well ...
 I ...
 I ...


 All I meantwas ...
 Oh , God .

 He quotes me , word forword :
 " Of course there will be redundancies .
 Lots ! "
 I 'm most terribly sorry .
 - Are all the drivers on strike ?
 - 100 % response .
 How could you allow this to happen ?
 C. B. E. , Minister .


 C. B. E ?
 Can 't be everywhere .

 Of course , in normal circumstances ...
 Yes .
 Yes .
 I know , I know .
 You and Mrs. Hackerare due at the French Embassy at 8 .


 Oh , yes .
 Get me the car , will you ?
 Oh ...
 Betterring Mrs. Hacker , ask herto bring ourcar into town .
 Mrs. Hackersays she has to drop it off at the garage .
 She 'll have to do that tomorrow .
 It 'll get us as faras Kensington .
 At least there are no problems about that .

 Annie , it 's no good .
 We 'll have to walk .
 - Have you got the umbrella ?
 - No , haven 't you ?
 Terrific .

 - You 're going the wrong way .
 - I 'm not , I 'm going home .
 Annie !
 I think I 've found what 's wrong .
 I know I have !



 Oui , Monsieur ?
 Her Majesty 's Minister forAdministrative Affairs .
 My carbroke down .

 Mr. Hacker , you look as if you need some champagne .
 I do .
 Lots !



 Mr. Hacker ?
 Hello .

 Thanks , mate .

 Gutterpress !

 All right , what do they say ?
 " Mr. Economyfalls down in gutter afterchampagne party " .
 - Oh , my God ! - This one is better . " Hackertired and emotional after Embassy reception " .
 - Is that better ?
 - It 's different .
 Do any of them say anything other than " tired and emotional " ?
 William Hickey said you were overwrought , Minister .
 - Nothing about being drunk ?
 - Just " overwrought " .
 " Overwrought as a newt " , actually .

 It couldn 't really be any worse .
 I don 'twant to depress you ... but there is just this lead story in The Times .
 It is worse !
 " Hackerrecruit 400 new Civil Servants in , quote , " economy drive " !
 - 400 more Civil Servants ?
 - You asked forthem . You demanded a complete study , facts and figures .
 These measures cannot be taken with non people .
 If you create more jobs , more people have to be employed .
 It 's common sense .
 If you persistwith the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office , there 'll be another400 new jobs there as well .

 - What are we going to do ?
 - Well , Minister ...
 If we were to end the economy drive and close the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office , we could issue a press announcement that you 'd axed 800 jobs .
 Now , if you 'd care to glance at this draft proposal ...
 But nobody 's doing those jobs .
 An even greatereconomy , we 've saved 800 redundancy payments .
 But that 's phoney , it 's cheating it 's dishonest , it 's just ... pulling the wool overpeople 's eyes .
 A Government Press release , in fact .
 But what are we actually going to do slim down the Civil Service ?
 Perhaps you 'd care to glance at this entirely fresh proposal .

 " Proposal for the Reduction of the Number of
 Tea Ladies " .
