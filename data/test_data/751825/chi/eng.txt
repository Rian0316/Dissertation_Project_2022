 Item 7 .
 What is item 7 ?
 Well , if I may just recapitulate ...
 - Ahem . - Sorry , Minister .
 You can 't actually recapitulate an item if you haven 't started it yet .
 Thank you .
 Where would we be without you ? May I continue ?
 Recapitulating on our last meeting and the minutes , which you doubtless received ...

 Doubtless , yes , yes .
 Er ... what minutes , Humphrey ?
 Disciplinary action against the South Derbyshire local authority .
 Ah , yes ...
 Will you remind me , Bernard ?
 They failed to complete their statutory returns and supply us with statistical information .
 - What 'll we do ?
 - The action we can take ?
 A rebuke from the minister , press statement about their incompetence , the withholding of grants or ultimately , as you are fully aware ...

 Yes , of course .
 Good .
 I 'm fully aware of what ?
 - What ?
 - What am I fully aware of ?
 - Um ...
 I can 't think of anything . I mean ... - You said , ultimately , as I am fully ...
 Ultimately , taking the local authority to court .
 Sorry . Is it that serious ?

 - Serious ?
 It 's catastrophic !
 - Why ?
 If local authorities don 't send us statistics , government figures will be a nonsense .
 - They 'll be incomplete .
 - Government figures are a nonsense , anyway .
 I think Sir Humphrey wants to ensure they 're a complete nonsense .
 I mean ... er ...
 Why should we make an example of South Derbyshire ?
 Do you object because the council 's controlled by your party ?
 Oh , no , no , no .
 No , no , no .
 But couldn 't we just ... pick on an opposition council ?
 - Oh , Minister !
 - Is South Derbyshire all that bad ?
 Terrible !
 They won 't return their blue forms !
 They haven 't completed last year 's employment trends questionnaire !
 They replied to our ethnic personnel breakdown request in longhand on the back of a departmental circular !
 We haven 't had their social worker revised analysis for the last two quarters or their data- processing appropriation tables !
 They 're unbelievable !
 Really evil !
 What , because they won 't return their forms in triplicate ?
 I don 't see how life can go on in Derbyshire !
 Exactly , Minister .
 They really are in a class of their own for incompetence .
 - Have they no redeeming features ? - It is fascinating ...
 If that 's all right , we can take coercive action .
 - The minister might like to know ... - You approve ?
 - Yes , it 's a difficult one .
 They 're friends .
 - They are no friends of good administration .
 Well , give me 24 hours .
 I 'll have to square the party organisation .
 Get the chairman invited to one of those drinky- do 's at Number 10 .
 - Soften the blow .
 Right , anything else ?
 - No , I think that seems to be all .

 Richard , I need your advice , if you can spare a moment .
 Bernard , I 'm not happy about ... - ( DOOR CLOSES ) ... disciplining South Derbyshire .
 - Why not , Minister ?
 - Instinct .
 Dr Cartwright seemed to be trying to tell me something .
 I think I 'll drop in on him .
 - I wouldn 't do that . - Why not ?
 If ministers want to know anything , it will be brought to their notice .
 If they go out looking for information , they might ...
 - Find it ?
 - Yes .
 Sir Humphrey does not take kindly to ministers dropping in on people .
 - Going walkabout , he calls it . - The Queen does it .
 She doesn 't drop in on Under- Secretaries , not in Sir Humphrey 's department .
 - What 's his room number ?
 - I must advise you against this . - Advice noted .
 - Room 4017 .

 Down one flight , second corridor on the left .
 If I 'm not back in 48 hours , send out a search party !
 Hello , Graham , it 's Bernard .
 Tell Sir Humphrey that the Minister 's just gone walkabout .
 Yes , yes , AWOL .
 Well , of course I told him , yes . I know .
 I think you 'd better let him know right away .

 One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine ...
 TEN .
 What 's all this about ?
 The minister 's just left the office , that 's all .
 That 's all ?
 Do you mean he 's loose in the building ?

 - Why didn 't you warn me ?
 - I did advise him , but he is the minister .
 There 's no prohibition against ministers talking to their staff .
 - Who 's he talking to ?
 - Perhaps he was just restless .
 If the minister 's restless , he can feed the ducks in St James 's Park !
 - Yes , Sir Humphrey .
 - Tell me who the minister 's talking to .
 Well , surely the minister can talk to anyone .
 Bernard ...
 I 'm in the middle of writing your annual report .

 Now , it is not a responsibility that either of us would wish me to discharge whilst I am in a bad temper .
 Who 's the minister talking to ?
 Perhaps you could help me .
 I can see that you should know if he calls on an outsider .
 I fail to see why you should be informed if he just wants to , to take a hypothetical example , to ... check a point with ...
 Dr Cartwright ...
 Thank you , Bernard .
 Must fly . - Room 4017 .
 - I know .


 Are those things about South Derbyshire true ?
 - They may be .
 - What are you saying ?
 I 'm saying that South Derbyshire is the most efficient local authority in the UK .
 - I 'm meant to tick them off for being the least .
 - Look at the figures .
 - I thought they didn 't send us any .
 - No .
 But they keep their own records perfectly well .
 I 'm going on those .

 They 've got the lowest truancy record in the Midlands . The lowest admin cost per council house .
 The lowest ratio of council workers to rate income .
 The lowest number of environmental health officers .
 - What are environmental health officers ? - Rat- catchers .

 Virtually all children can read and write , even though they 've had a progressive education .
 They 've got the smallest establishment of social workers in the UK .
 - Is that supposed to be a good thing ?
 - Oh , yes . Sign of efficiency .
 Parkinson 's Law of Social Work , you see .
 Social problems increase to occupy the number of social workers available to deal with them .
 - And all these figures are OK ? - Yes , I assure you .
 Richard , I wonder if I ...

 Good heavens , Minister .
 - Humphrey , what a coincidence .
 - Yes , indeed , what a surprise ! - Yes .
 - Yes .
 I was just ... passing .
 - Passing ?
 - Yes , passing . - Oh , passing .
 And where were you going ?
 - I was just going ... past .

 Past the door .
 Cartwright 's ... Richard 's door .
 And I thought ... " Hello ... "
 Did you think anything further ?
 Yes , I thought , " Why should I pass the door ?
 Why not open it ? "
 - Good thinking , that 's what doors are for .
 - Right .
 - There were some points I wanted to clear up .
 - Oh , good , good . What points ?
 - Just a couple of odd points .
 - Couple of odd points .

 - How odd ?
 - Oh ... not all that odd .
 - We just had a meeting .
 - Could I have a word with you ?
 - Yes , of course , as soon as ...
 - No , I mean now . - All right , carry on .
 - No , upstairs in your office .
 - I 'm sure Richard doesn 't mind .
 - No , upstairs .
 I 'm sure that Dr Cartwright can spare you for a few moments .
 Thank you , Richard .
 Minister .

 ( LlFT PlNGS )
 You may go , Bernard .
 - Minister , what was all that in aid of ?
 - I have learnt some interesting facts .
 - I hope it does not happen again .
 - I beg your pardon ?
 - You cannot speak to people in the department .
 - Why not ?
 How can I advise you if I don 't know what 's said ?
 I must know what is going on .
 You cannot have private conversations !
 - You may be told things that are not true !
 - You can put me right .
 But they may be true !

 Not entirely false , but misleading , open to misinterpretation .
 - You 're trying to keep things from me . - Absolutely not , Minister .
 Minutes must be taken , records must be kept .
 You won 't be here for ever , nor will we . In years to come ...
 If Cartwright were moved tomorrow , how could we check information ?
 - Cartwright won 't be moved tomorrow .
 - Oh , really ?


 - Alex Andrews from the Mail to see you . - Ah , hang on .
 I 'd like you to minute this .
 Everything must be minuted , you know .
 Sit down , won 't you , Humphrey ?
 - Now ...
 South Derbyshire Council ...
 - Just a minute . Yes , that 's what I said .

 South Derbyshire .
 Dr Cartwright said it is the most efficient council in Britain .
 - Inefficient , I think he means .
 - Efficient , Humphrey . Economical , effective .
 Just not interested in sending bits of blue paper to Whitehall .
 - But they have to send them . - Why ?
 - It is a statutory requirement .
 - And if they don 't , Britain carries on .
 - South Derbyshire carries on .
 - But if they don 't send us the information , the plans and the requests for permission , well , what are we here for ?
 Good question .
 What ARE we here for ?
 To collate information , inspects plans , and withhold or grant permission .
 - And if we didn 't ?
 - I 'm sorry , Minister , I don 't understand .
 If we weren 't here and we didn 't do it , what then ?
 - I 'm sorry , you 've lost me .
 - You 're concerned more with means than ends .
 There are no ends in administration , Minister , except loose ends . Administration is eternal !
 - For ever and ever .
 - ( HUMPHREY AND BERNARD ) Amen !
 Because there are no ends , they talk about government circles .
 Exactly , Bernard , which is what we 're going round in ! I won 't discipline South Derbyshire .
 I 'd look a complete idiot .
 I 'm sorry , Minister , but it 's your job .

 To discipline South Derbyshire .
 You have no alternative .
 - The Treasury and the Cabinet Office insist .
 - I cannot agree to this .
 Not today , anyhow . - Tomorrow , then .
 - No !
 I 'm sorry , you don 't seem to understand .
 It is not up to you or to me .
 It is the law .
 - Minister , I think you ought to talk to the Mail .
 - Very well .
 - Thank you , Humphrey .
 - Thank you , Minister .

 - Bernard .
 Bernard . - Yes , Minister ?



 How did Sir Humphrey know I was with Dr Cartwright ?
 God moves in a mysterious way .
 Let me make one thing perfectly clear . Humphrey is not God , OK ?


 Will you tell him or shall I ?

 Now , tell me how he knew where I was .
 Confidentially , everything you tell me is in complete confidence so equally , and I 'm sure you appreciate this , and , by appreciate , I don 't mean appreciate ,
 I mean understand , that everything Sir Humphrey tells me is also in confidence , as indeed everything I tell you and everything I tell Sir Humphrey is in complete confidence .


 So ?
 So , in confidence , I am confident you understand that for me to keep Sir Humphrey 's confidence , conversations between him and me must be confidential , as confidential as conversations between you and me are completely confidential .



 - Mr Andrews , Minister . - Thank you , Bernard . - Ah , Alex .
 - Hello , Jim .
 - Sit down .
 - Thank you .
 - What can I do for you ?
 - I need your help . I 've come across a fascinating story .

 Do you realise that your government is about to hand over £40 million- worth of housing , building , harbour installations and an airstrip to a private developer for nothing ? - £40 million ? !

 You 're having me on !
 - No , Scout 's honour .


 - Why tell me ?
 I didn 't do it , did I ? - No .


 It goes back a long way .
 30 years ago , the Ministry of Defence took out a lease on a Scottish island .
 They put up billets , married quarters , HQ block , the harbour , the airstrip .
 And now the lease has expired , it reverts to the original owner . He 's opening up a holiday camp .
 Yachting marinas , chalets , staff quarters .
 It 's all there . He 'll make a fortune .
 - He can 't do that .
 The law ...
 - No , you 're talking about English law .
 This contract was made under Scottish law .
 Some idiot didn 't realise the difference . - We 're in the clear .
 - Ah , yes .
 Even the Mail can 't blame you for a cock- up in the early '50s .
 Makes a change . What do you want from me ?
 You 've got your story . 30 years late .
 As quick with the news as ever !
 Still , not bad for Fleet Street !
 We 're running it tomorrow , but my editor wants me to do a feature , find out how it happened , go through the files .
 - Why ? - There could be lessons for today .
 We might find out who is responsible .
 Does it matter ?
 It would 've been handled by quite a junior official .
 30 years ago .
 Today he could be in an important position .
 He could be a Permanent Secretary running a great department , responsible for spending billions of pounds of public money .
 - Pretty unlikely .
 - Yes . But can I see the papers ?
 Of course , I can 't just hand files over .
 Didn 't you say it was a 30- year lease ?
 You can get them from the Public Records Office under the 30- year rule .
 Yes , I thought you 'd say that , but I want a guarantee that I will get ALL of them .
 - Well , Defence papers ... - Come on , this is not top security .
 You made a manifesto commitment saying you 'd tell voters the facts .
 This is a test case .
 I want your guarantee that no papers will be removed from the file before it 's opened .
 I don 't see why not .
 No skin off my nose . Is that a promise ?
 A REAL promise , not the sort you put in your manifesto !
 You know , the problem with you , Alex , is you won 't take yes for an answer !
 Otherwise we do the feature about ministers ratting on manifestos .

 Is that the lot , Humphrey ?

 Oh , I 'm sorry .
 That seems to be all , Minister , thank you .
 Incidentally , Humphrey , did you see that story in the Mail this morning ?
 - About the Scottish island scandal .
 - I 'm not sure .
 About some cock- up somebody made 30 years ago about the terms of the lease .
 I believe I did glance at it . £40 million down the tube !
 Somebody really boobed there !

 - It didn 't happen in your department ? - Absolutely not . - I wonder who it was .
 - That is something we shall never know .
 It 'll be on the files .
 Everything must be put in writing , as you 're always telling me .
 Well ... somewhere , no doubt , but it would take ages to search .
 Not worth anyone 's time .
 You may be wrong .
 The Mail want to do a big feature .
 As soon as the papers are released under the 30- year rule in a few weeks ,
 I promised them a free run of all the files .
 - Minister !
 - It 's all right , isn 't it ? All right ?
 It most certainly is NOT all right !
 - Why on earth not ?
 - It 's impossible , it 's unthinkable ! - Why ? - It 's top security !
 - A few barracks ?
 - Secret naval installations !
 Anti- submarine systems !
 Low- level radar towers !
 - You don 't know that .
 - That 's the sort of thing those bases have .
 - But they 'd have been dismantled .
 - The papers will have references ! - Ancient history .
 - We need to get clearances .
 Who from ?
 Security implications !
 Ml5 ! Ml6 ! Foreign powers !


 National interests ! Consult our allies !

 Top brass ! ClA , NATO , SEATO , Moscow !


 - Moscow ?
 Are you all right , Humphrey ? - Er , no , not Moscow .
 I didn 't mean Moscow .
 But this information could seriously damage people still alive .
 The people who drew up this contract ought to be damaged ! Oh , absolutely !
 No question of protecting officials ! Of course not !
 But ... responsible ministers ...
 It 's 30 years ago .
 In any case , weren 't the other lot in office then ? - Well , yes ...
 - Why are you so concerned ?


 Oh , I 'm not , no , no .
 Not me , personally , but it 's the principle , the precedent , the policy ...
 The policy is up to me , Humphrey , and I 've said yes , so it 's done .
 OK ?


 What 's the matter with Humphrey ?
 I haven 't done anything wrong , have I ?
 There aren 't any security implications , are there ?
 What 's the problem ?


 - Am I talking to myself ? - No , I 'm listening . - Why don 't you answer ?
 - I thought your questions were purely rhetorical .
 - I see no reason for him to be so anxious .
 - Unless ...

 - Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? - I don 't think so , Minister .
 I 'm not thinking anything , really .
 - I begin to smell a rat .
 - Shall I get an environmental health officer ?


 How long has Sir Humphrey been here at Administrative Affairs ?
 - Since it was founded .
 - When was that ? 1964 .
 The same time they started the Department for Economic ...

 - Now I think I 'm thinking what you 're thinking . - And what are you thinking ?
 You 're thinking , where was he before 1964 ?
 It 'll be in " Who 's Who " .
 He must 've been in another department and trawled for the DAA .
 - What ?
 - Trawled .
 You know , fished , caught in the net .

 - Ah , here we are .
 Oh , my God ! - What ?



 From 1950 to 1956 , he was Assistant Principal at the Scottish Office .
 On secondment from the War Office . Ah .
 Regional Contracts Officer . 30 years ago .

 So the official ... ... who chucked away £40 million ... ... of taxpayers ' money was ...

 How frightful !
 - It 's awful , Minister . - Dreadful .
 And all the papers due for release in a few weeks ' time .
 - Get Humphrey to come back here at once . - Yes , Minister .

 The Minister wonders if Sir Humphrey could spare time for a meeting sometime in the next few days .
 - At once .
 - In fact , sometime today is really ... - At once !
 - Sometime during the next 60 seconds .

 - He 's coming round now . - Why ? Did he faint ?



 - No , he 's just , you know ... - This is serious , Bernard .
 Yes , I know .

 - This is no laughing matter . - No , certainly not .

 The question is ... ... how am I going to deal with it ?
 - In my opinion ...
 - The question was rhetorical .

 - You wanted a word , Minister ? - Humphrey , come in , come in .

 Sorry , Bernard .
 ( BERNARD CHUCKLES )
 I 've been thinking about this Scottish island scandal . - Very worrying .
 - Well , I don 't know ...
 You probably don 't realise this , but that official could still be in the Civil Service .
 - Very unlikely .
 - But why ?
 He could 've been in his mid- 20s then , he 'd be in his mid- 50s now .
 Might even be a Permanent Secretary ! - I hardly think ...
 - No , of course , you 're right .
 Nobody who made a blunder like that could become a Permanent Secretary .
 - Anyway , I want a full investigation . - We can 't find out that sort of thing .
 I mean , you said yourself that minutes are always made , records kept in the Civil Service .
 But surely we can .
 And legal documents concerning a current contract wouldn 't have been thrown away .
 Minister ... aren 't we making a little too much of this ?
 Possibly blighting a brilliant career because of a ... tiny slip 30 years ago ?
 - After all , it 's not such a lot of money wasted . - £40 million ?

 Well , not compared with Blue Streak ,
 TSR . 2 , Trident , Concorde , high- rise council flats ,
 British Rail ,
 British Leyland , British Steel ,
 Upper Clyde Shipbuilders , the atomic power station programme , comprehensive schools , the University of Essex .

 I take your point , but it 's still more , a hundred times more , than this official could ever have earned in his entire career .
 So I want you to look into it and find out who it was . OK ?


 - Yes , Humphrey ?
 - There is something you ought to know .
 Yes , Humphrey ?
 The identity of the official whose alleged responsibility for this hypothetical oversight , as being the subject of recent discussion , is not shrouded in quite such impenetrable obscurity as previous disclosures led you to assume .


 But not to put too fine a point on it ... ... the individual in question is , it may surprise you to learn , one whom your present interlocutor ... ... is in the habit of defining ... ... by means of the perpendicular pronoun .



 I beg your pardon ?

 It was ... I.
 Humphrey !

 - No ?
 - I was under pressure !

 We were overworked , there was panic ! Parliamentary questions tabled .
 Obviously I 'm not a trained lawyer or I wouldn 't have been in charge of the Legal Unit !
 - 30 years ago !
 Everybody makes mistakes !
 - Well , Humphrey ...
 I forgive you .

 Oh , thank you , Minister . Why didn 't you tell me about this before ?
 We have no secrets from each other , have we ?

 - That is for you to say , Minister . - Well , not entirely .
 Anyhow , what are we going to do ?
 I 'm going to be roasted if I don 't release all those papers to the Mail .
 I might be able to do something about it ... if I hadn 't got this other worry on my plate .
 What other worry ?

 Being roasted by the press for disciplining the most efficient council in Great Britain .
 I 've been thinking about South Derbyshire . - Oh , good .
 - Obviously we can 't change the law .
 Perhaps we might show them leniency - a private word with the Chief Executive .
 - Give them a chance to mend their ways .
 - That might help considerably .
 How will I explain the missing documents to the Mail ?
 Well , this is what we normally do in ... ... circumstances like these .

 " This file contains the complete set of papers , except for a number of secret documents ,
 " a few others which are part of still- active files ,
 " some correspondence lost in the floods of 1967 ... "
 Was 1967 a particularly bad winter ?
 No , a marvellous winter .
 We lost no end of embarrassing files . " ... records lost in the move to London , or when the War Office joined the Ministry of Defence ,
 " and the withdrawal of papers that could give grounds for an action
 " for libel or breach of confidence or cause embarrassment to friendly governments . "
 Well , that 's pretty comprehensive .
 How many does that normally leave for them to look at ?
 How many does it actually leave ?
 About a hundred ?
 Fifty ?


 Ten ?
 Five ?

 Four ?
 Three ? Two ?



 One ?

 Zero ?
 Yes , Minister .
