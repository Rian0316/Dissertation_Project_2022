 Whatever you wanna do , I 'm in your corner .

 Mr. Faladi ...
 - I love him , and he loves me ! Aah !
 -
 He suffered significant memory loss .
 - Susan Mayer . - We were close , huh ?
 That tramp treated you like dirt .






 Good afternoon . I 'm , uh , Bree Hodge , and you are ? Name 's Gus , and we 're all booked up .
 - Actually , Gus , um ,
 I 'm here to see one of your guests -- a gentleman named Faladi .
 Oh , yeah , came in about an hour ago .
 You want me to call him for you ? - No , no , no , no . I 'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so I can walk in unannounced .
 ( laughs ) Lady , I can 't do that .
 Besides , he has a girl in there . She 's my daughter -- my 17- year- old daughter .
 Yes , I know .
 ( chuckles ) Yeah .
 Uh , that would be , uh , room , uh , 17 .
 Now there 's irony for you . ( laughs ) You don 't have a gun in there , do you ?
 Because I just put down new carpet . Oh , Gus , I don 't plan anything unpleasant .
 I 'm simply going to inform Mr. Faladi what repercussions he faces if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason .


 - ( Mr. Faladi ) What the hell ? ! - ( Danielle ) Mom ! What are you doing here ? !
 You just can 't walk right in here .
 - How can you do this to me ? !
 What makes you think that you can walk in here ...

 ( Mr. Faladi ) I told you , it 's over !
 ( Danielle crying ) But I love you ! - Okay , didn 't you hear her ? ! So how 'd it go ?
 Quite well , I think .


 Oh , and , Gus , the carpet is beautiful .




 I don 't know when I 've tasted such tender spring lamb .
 THank you , dear . Danielle , you haven 't touched your dinner .
 She doesn 't like spring lamb . She prefers old goat . ( stifles laugh )


 Your mother was right to end that relationship .

 He 's getting a divorce . Well , that hardly bolsters his suitability .
 Danielle , please , eat something .
 - Don 't worry , dear . Hunger strikes demand self- control , and as we 've seen , that 's hardly her strong suit .
 When are you gonna take me seriously ?
 - When you start acting like an adult .
 Well , she sleeps with them . That 's a start . I hate you !
 I hate all of you !



 Remind me to buy paper plates .
 We 'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again .

 Aah !
 Wow , you 're pretty good at that .
 Hey , you are home early .
 Hi .
 Mwah .
 Yes ...
 I am .
 What is all this ?
 We are having a celebration .
 Sit .
 ( chuckles ) What are we celebrating ?
 You being the greatest wife in the world .
 ( laughs ) THanks .
 No , seriously , though .
 I mean it .
 How many wives would tell their husbands to follow his dreams , and then have the patience to wait while he figures out what the hell it is ?
 Oh , my God ! You know what you wanna do ! That 's fantastic !
 What is it ? Wait for it , wait for it ...
 Okay , I knew I needed to spend my days doing something I was passionate about , something creative -- yeah , have at it -- ** um , something where I interacted with the public but I was still my own boss , and then this morning , it just like -- bam , it hit me !

 Okay , okay , I 'm dying here . What 's the dream ?
 You 're eating it . Excuse me ?
 I 'm gonna open up a pizza parlor !

 I bet you didn 't see that one coming .
 No , that was a real frisbee to the head , that one .
 But -- but when you think about it , doesn 't it make perfect sense ?
 I mean , marinara 's in my blood .
 You remember uncle Vito ? He came to this country with nothing . He turned that trattoria into a gold mine .
 Isn 't he the one that ... asked us for a loan last Christmas ?
 He has a gambling problem , but don 't blame the pizza .
 Trust me . I 've got this thing all mapped out .
 It 's gonna have , like , a real family feel , with , like , big portions but small prices , crayons for the kids .
 Oh , God , I feel good about this .
 Hmm . So what do you think ?
 I think ...
 I 'm gonna open another bottle of wine . But we haven 't finished this one .
 Well , hey , we 're celebrating , right ?



 Carlos , what are you doing in my room ?
 Oh , hey , Gaby , you 're home early .
 God , Carlos !
 Strawberries and champagne ? Did you really think you 're gonna seduce me ? Never entered my mind .
 - Oh , right , right .
 You know , I may be living with you until the divorce is final , but it doesn 't mean
 I have to put up with your cheesy come- ons .
 Gaby , can I just say one thing ?
 What , you 've been doing some thinking , and you realize that I 'm your soul mate , and there 's a vacancy in your heart only I can fill ?
 Gaby , listen -- it 's over between us .
 Just move on already .
 Forget me .



 As I was trying to say , I have company over .
 This is Trishelle .
 Trishelle , this is ... what was your name again ?
 I seem to have forgotten .


 So the doctor said
 I should use as many things as I can to jog your memory .
 And not just pictures .
 He said I could use tastes and smells and sounds , so tonight is ... " sounds of the seventies . "
 Okay , uh ... Well , you know , let me set the scene .
 Um , we were at this funky little fish joint that you 'd been dying to take me to -- Cappy 's .
 Do you remember Cappy 's ?
 Okay , well , we were there , and , uh , we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever --
 How long till the music part ?
 Oh , it 's coming . Um , and -- and this ' 70s cover band , well , they started to play , and ... that 's how we got our song .


 Our song was " Car Wash " ? Yeah ! See how much fun we were ?
 ( laughs ) So I dragged you out onto the dance floor , and , well , you were giving me this look -- sort of like the look you 're giving me right now -- and , um , I started to do this ... and then you did this ...

 I 'm -- look , I 'm sorry , this -- this isn 't working .
 Oh , Mike . Come on , you 're not even trying to remember !
 It was fun !
 Oh , I know .
 Okay , sing with me . * car wash
 * talkin ' about the car wash * * whoo , car wash , yeah

 You know , I 'm really beat . Okay , Mike , I- I am not doing this to upset you .
 I 'm doing this to help .
 I get that . it 's just ... the music is giving me a headache .
 Okay , well ...
 I 'll go , but I am not giving up on you .
 You know , you are going to remember the night that We danced to " Car Wash , " and not just because it was fun , but because later that night , we did some things that , trust me , are worth remembering .




 That Jane Doe from the golf course ...
 I think I missed something at the autopsy .
 Check it out .
 - You always gotta come at lunch , don 't you ?
 Those blue marks on the back of her hand ? First I thought they were veins .
 Now I think it 's ink .
 You mean , like some kind of writing ? I need to run some more tests , see if I can get a clearer image . Yeah .

 I could be wrong , but ...
 But what ?
 I think it 's a phone number .


 The oddest thing happened at the club today .
 Tish Atherton --
 ( sighs ) Andrew , would you be a dear and make sure your sister 's just breaking her own things ?

 Anyway ... Hmm .
 Tish Atherton ...
 Danielle ?


 Yeah , I 'll tell 'em .
 I 'm telling you , it was a deliberate snub .
 I waved to her , and she looked right through me .
 True , I never bought her eldest daughter a gift -- - Uh , Mom ?
 Andrew , please don 't interrupt me while I 'm speaking .
 True , I never bought her eldest daughter a gift , but you know my policy -- no husband , no baby gift .
 Now what is it , dear ?
 Well , um , Danielle 's upstairs trying to commit suicide .




 How can you sit there playing that ridiculous game ? ! Your sister tried to kill herself .
 That doesn 't upset you ?
 She tried to slit her wrists with a spoon . How upset do you want me to be ? Mrs. Hodge ?
 - Is my daughter all right ? She 's a little groggy , but she 'll be fine .
 The wounds are fairly superficial .
 ( scoffs ) So 's the patient .
 We 'll release her tonight , but you understand that in cases like this , counseling is mandatory .
 - Of course . We 'll get her all the help she needs .
 She is resisting our efforts to pump her stomach .
 She says she only took three sedatives . She 's disoriented .
 Pump her . Andrew !

 Pump her .


 They 're sticking a tube down her throat .
 Do you still think this is funny ?
 Mom , this was a half- assed bid for attention .
 This was a cry for help , and if we don 't listen , the next time she could do something even more dangerous .
 Yeah , next time she might jump off the porch .
 Stop it ! Suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family ! I will not have it made light of !
 ( exhales deeply )



 Orson 's right .
 We need to support each other as a family .
 In fact ,
 I say we all ... go for counseling .


 ( Gabrielle ) Tom actually said he 's opening up a pizza parlor ?
 ( Susan ) Lynette , you 're not serious .
 Mm- hmm .
 - Well , might as well stand in a vat of tomato sauce and tear up $100 bills .
 - I know , but I said that I would support him and help him follow his dream .
 Well , he can 't hold you to that , not if the dream is pizza .
 She promised to stand by him , and once you make that commitment you have to see it through . - yeah ...
 How 's that divorce going ?
 I 'm done talking . - Hey , Parker , be careful up there .
 I just keep thinking he 's gonna come to his senses and realize it 's a bad idea .
 That 's never gonna happen .
 - Why ?
 Because men are genetically incapable of realizing that their dreams are stupid . Care to elaborate , Dr. McCluskey ?
 My husband sold insurance for 36 years , and one day , he woke up and decided he wanted to move to paris and paint naked ladies .
 I told him , " Gilbert , you can barely paint the garage .
 What makes you think you can commit art ? "
 And for the rest of his life , he despised me .
 He despised you for saying " no " ?
 Well , he also thought I was sleeping with his brother , and I 'm sure that was mixed in there , too .

 Okay , so I got Kayla all unpacked . Oh , great .
 So , uh , Tom will drop her off at your house on friday .
 Sounds good .
 Lynette , can I talk to you for a second ?
 Mm- hmm . Yeah .


 Okay , pardon me for having really big ears , but I heard about Tom and this pizza place .
 Do you wanna know what I think ?
 - No , not really .
 It sucks . It 's a sucky idea , and your friends back there -- they 're just too nice to come right out and say it .

 Luckily , I 'm not your friend , so you can trust me .
 Nip it ... in ... the bud .
 And make Tom resent me for the rest of his life . I don 't think so .
 Well , you better do somethin ' , ' cause if you don 't , you me will wind up working a pole to pay for braces .


 Hey , Julie .
 I bought you some flowers .
 they don 't still have the roots on them .
 Okay , uh , I was hoping you could help me with my English Lit paper .
 Hi , I 'm Sarah .
 - Hey . So what do you say ?
 - Actually , I 'm sort of busy right now . Oh , come on .
 Look , aunt Edie 's gonna give me the boot if I flunk out .
 Wouldn 't you miss me ?
 - Oh , absolutely ! Whose motorcycle would wake us all up at 2 : 00 in the morning ?

 You drive a motorcycle ? - Hmm . ( sighs ) Please ?
 Look , I could really use some help here .

 Normally , I charge 12 bucks an hour for tutoring , but seeing as it 's you ... $15 .
 Great .
 See you friday .
 Oh , and just so you know ,
 I charge $15 an hour to make out , so I 'll probably break even .
 Ugh .
 Hi .
 You 're new .
 Where 's Marcy ?
 She 's in Honolulu on vacation .
 Can I help you ?
 Oh , I 'm just going to see Mike Delfino .
 What 's that smell ?
 - Uh , that 's my macaroni and cheese .
 I- I was hoping it would trigger Mike 's memory .
 I made it the first time we met two years ago . - You should 've refrigerated it .


 Edie ?
 Oh , you know Ms. Britt ?
 Uh , yeah .
 What is she doing here ?
 Visiting Mr. Delfino .
 You know , she was with him when he came out of his coma .
 And she 's been here every day since .
 You !

 Hello , Susan .
 Long time no see . I 've been wondering why Mike 's been so cold to me .
 Now it all makes sense .
 - I 'm sure I have no idea what you 're talking about . Whew ! for God 's sakes , take a bath .
 Oh , that 's my mac and cheese .
 Don 't change the subject . What have you been telling him about me ?
 - Why would I say anything about you ?
 Mike has no idea who you are .
 I envy him .
 Ladies , is there a problem ?
 I want this woman banned from the hospital .
 She 's been like this ever since Mike dumped her .
 Imagine " Fatal Attraction " ... with a much older woman .
 Ma 'am , Mr. Delfino already has a visitor .
 I think you should go . Me ? But why doesn 't she leave ?
 I- I 'm the one who 's been here every day for the last six months . Well , I don 't know you , but I do know his girlfriend .



 Girlfriend ? ! Okay , you know what ?
 I want Marcy 's number in Honolulu , and I want it right now . You need to leave . - What ? !
 You 're disturbing the other patients . - No , what are you -- Oh , this is ridiculous !
 I mean , who am I disturbing ? It 's a coma ward ! Don 't you want them to wake up ? !

 I didn 't call you that - yes , you did !
 I have never in my life used the word " retard . " - It 's what you think .
 You think I 'm that immature moron who can 't be trusted to decide what 's best for her .
 - Well , you did try to off yourself .
 I don 't think you get to pull the " I know what 's best for me " card .
 - Andrew ! ( lowered voice ) Not in front of the therapist . Actually , I think we 're making great progress .
 You feel Danielle refuses to see you 're acting in her best interest .
 And you think your mother cares more about her image than your feelings .
 - Danielle , how can you think I don 't care about your feelings ?
 Don 't you know how much your mother loves you ? When I saw you in that tub , it was the worst moment of my life .
 The thought of losing you is more than I can bear .
 How does that make you feel ?

 Actually ... kind of powerful .

 Powerful ?
 You don 't wanna lose me ? - of course not .
 I already went through thinking I 'd lost Andrew .
 I can 't go through that again .
 Well , then , here 's what 's going to happen --
 I 'm going to start dating Robert again , and if you try to break us up or get him fired , then I 'm going to leave , and you will see me again .
 - Danielle .
 If that can survive on its own , so can I. You don 't believe me ? Call my bluff .
 See what happens .

 So ... what do we owe you for all this ?

 Come on , Austin . Concentrate . Okay , why did Iago betray Othello ?
 ( sighs ) Uh ... because the play would suck if he didn 't ?
 What do you think you 're doing ? Mmm .
 Sorry .
 No ! No , no , no , no ! No , no , we 're here to work .
 And if my mom came home , she 'd flip . Now put that away .
 Ahh .
 You said , " put it away . "
 Look , if -- if you think
 I 'm gonna sit here and write your paper for you while you 're getting drunk -- - No , just help me get it started , okay ? This is hard for me , all right ?
 I didn 't read a lot of Shakespeare in juvie . I kind of majored in not getting stabbed .
 Ugh , fine .
 I 'll write your intro , but -- but then you 're on your own .
 THank you very much . ( sighs )
 So ... why did they send you to juvie anyway ?
 " They " didn 't .
 My mom did .
 Why ?
 She had this boyfriend -- no job , big drunk , catch .
 One night , he pops her one , so I break a chair over his head , and , uh ... and she calls the cops ... on .
 But you were protecting her . Yeah , that 's what I thought .
 But the guy said he 'd leave if she didn 't press charges , and ... well , my mom doesn 't really like to be alone .
 You know what ?
 You 're tired . Um , why don 't you lay down for a couple minutes , and I 'll just do a page or two ?

 You 're a rock star , Mayer .


 Carlos ... no Trishelle tonight ?
 Ah , no .
 About her -- I have a confession to make .
 Does her pimp want the rest of the money ? You know , there is some cash in my purse .
 Look , I know I crossed a line bringing her here , all right ?
 But I was trying to make you jealous ,
 like the way you made me feel when you said you slept with John Rowland again .
 Well , I think it 's more than that .
 That 's not true . - Oh , I think it is .
 You know , introducing your spouse to someone you 're about to have sex with ?
 There 's only one reason to do that -- pure hatred .
 You don 't know what you 're talking about .

 Oh , I think I do .
 Phil , come meet my basically ex- husband -- tHank you -- Carlos . Carlos , this is my new friend Phil Lopez .
 We 've met , Gaby .
 Really ? Well , that 's weird . When ?
 Fairview Chamber of Commerce -- the annual dinner . Oh , my God ! That 's right !
 That 's right ! ( laughs )
 You were up for the latino businessman of the year award that Phil won .
 Well , actually , I beat him out twice .
 No !
 Ooh , I remember . Carlos was so annoyed . What did you say , hon ?
 " He may have that trophy , but I 've got you . "

 Ain 't life funny ? ( laughs )
 Gaby , can we talk for a sec ?
 Mnh- mnh , not right now . Phil and I are getting in the hot tub . Ooh , Phil , did you bring your suit ?
 - You said I didn 't have to .

 Go outside . I 'll meet you there .


 Phil Lopez ? You brought home Phil Lopez ? !
 I had no idea you hated me that much !
 Well , now you know .

 Aah !

 Hey , good news .
 My realtor found me some sweet locations .
 That 's ... great .
 ( chuckles )
 Hey , can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second ?
 Yeah . What 's up ?
 I don 't know if you noticed , but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept ... ( chuckles ) I was a wee bit skeptical .
 Yeah , I sensed that .
 Of course you did , ' Cause you 're a smart guy , which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea I have to make the whole thing work .
 Okay , so you 're not bailing on me ? No . No , no , no , I am totally on board .
 ( laughs ) Oh , good !
 You had me scared there for a second .
 Okay , so , well , what is this great idea ?
 I 'm thinking ... catering company .
 Huh ?
 Start small , have an Italian theme , create some cash flow , and then later on , expand into the pizza thing .
 But that 's not my dream . Well , think about it . You 're gonna do all these fun parties .
 People will start talking -- " Hey , this is great food . This guy should open a restaurant . "
 " Yeah , yeah , I 'd eat there , " and then wham !
 Five short years later , you have a built- in customer base .
 But I said it 's not my dream .
 Pizza is my dream . I know , I know .
 Catering 's how you get there . - So why can 't I just skip the catering and go straight to the pizza ? - Because you 'll fail !
 I 'm sorry !
 God .
 ( groans ) I shouldn 't have said that .
 But you 're gambling with our life savings , and you have no experience .
 You said that you 'd support me .

 I 'm trying to . I am trying to .
 But are you aware that 90 % of restaurants tank in their first year ?
 Which means that 10 % of them make it ! Why don 't you ever think that I would be one of them ? No !
 No , do me a favor .
 Don 't answer that .


 Yoo- hoo !
 Carlos !
 I 'm making a snack for Phil .
 Do you want something to eat ?
 Some sour grapes , perhaps ?
 Maybe a little crow ?



 Okay , we need to move this over there .
 Why ?
 Uh , Feng Shui .




 ( banging ) ( Gabrielle ) Yes !
 Yes !
 ( laughs ) Hey , don 't start without me .
 ( lowered voice ) Oh , no , no , let 's get something straight -- you and I are not gonna have sex tonight .
 What ? I 'm sorry .
 No offense , you 're a nice guy .
 I 'm just not into you that way . Oh , God , Phil !
 Yes , yes , give it to me ! Okay .
 Oh , okay . No , no , I 'm not talking to you . Back off !
 What -- but I thought -- I mean ...
 You know , the hot tub ... We were ...
 - Yes , you saw my boobs , and you 're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life ... but that is you 're getting !

 Wait , wait , so you 're just using me ? You 're unbelievable .
 I 'm what ? ! ( Phil ) You are unbelievable !
 Really ?
 Oh , so are you , big boy ! Yes !




 No wonder you 're divorcing her .
 She 's a straight- up loon .
 Oh , crap .
 She 's blocking my car !
 Always happy to help a brother out . Hold on .

 ( Gabrielle ) Oh , God , yes !
 Oh , ride 'em , cowboy !
 Oh , yes , God !
 Take me home , Philly !
 You should wear a saddle ! Yes ! Yes !
 Stop it , Phil . - I told you to beat it .
 No means no !
 I need your car keys .
 You 're blocking the stallion 's hatchback .

 " Oh , yes , yes , Phil !
 Fill me with Phil ! "
 I never said that .
 - ( chuckles ) And you moved the bed . What were you thinking ? - You know , if you were trying to hurt me , that 's not the way to do it .
 Shut up .
 - Well , then enlighten me .
 How can I hit you so hard that you will never recover ?

 You can 't .
 Oh , I have to , Carlos .
 I need you to give up on us . We 're not good for each other , and I can 't keep doing this .
 But I can .
 You proved something tonight -- you had a rich , good- looking guy in your bed , and you couldn 't pull the trigger .
 That means you still care , and as long as I know that ,
 I can take anything that you can dish out . You know what ?
 I 'm tired . Can we talk about this in the morning ? Sure .
 But you 're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal .
 It 's a date .



 Sarah ?
 What are you -- oh !
 Oh , Julie !
 THank God it 's you .
 We totally thought you were the cops .
 ( grunts ) Oh , hey , Julie .
 What are you , on buzz kill patrol tonight ?

 is why you couldn 't go to the movies with me ?
 Well , sorry , I thought you weren 't that into him .
 But , you know , if you are -- I 'm not !
 I 'm just -- I 'm mad that you blew me off .
 Well , I would totally understand if you wanted to blow me off for a date .

 ( scoffs ) You call this a date -- getting mauled in a car ?
 Hey , you wanna talk about this later ?
 I 'm losing altitude here .



 Julie , there you are . I think I found a way to get through to Mike .
 Let it go !
 He 's not into you !

 Gaby , rise and shine .
 I made you some waffles .
 I got a second wind last night , so I went to a bar .
 That 's where I met Jason .
 We spent the whole night -- how did you put it ?
 Pulling the trigger .

 So did I hurt you , or should I keep trying ?


 You kicked ass in rehab today .
 Yeah , I raised my arm over my head .
 Sign me up for the olympics .
 Oh , be patient . It takes time . Ms. Britt ? hmm ?
 Phone call for you at the nurses ' station . For me ? Huh .
 I 'll be right back .



 There 's a phone call for me ? Susan ?
 What are you --
 Shh !
 I thought you could use some fresh air .
 Hello ?
 Hello ? It 's Edie .



 What the hell is this ? Who 's he ?
 Oh , this is Hank , and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today ... for 60 bucks an hour .
 Where are you taking me ?
 Uh , just a little jaunt down Memory Lane . Oh , God , you 're not taking me to that fish and disco place , are you ?
 ( laughs ) No , no .
 What we 're doing today is a little more low- key . Don 't worry . You 're totally safe .
 We 're not doing anything wrong . Punch it !




 Hello .
 - Look , Mrs. Hodge , uh , I 've only seen your daughter once since the motel .
 She told me that you backed off .
 Oh , Mr. Faladi , I 'm not here to threaten you .
 I 've come to give you my blessing .
 - Your blessing ?
 Yes , Danielle made it quite clear that I 'm powerless to stop this relationship , and since she assures me that you love her --
 You do love her , don 't you ?
 Uh , yes , of course . Good . Then we 're all set .
 Here are some of her clothes .
 I 'll bring her CDs and her stuffed animals over tomorrow .
 You want her to stay here ?
 This place is kind of small .
 Well , that hotel room was small , and you seemed happy enough there .
 Oh , and I trust you to be discreet .
 You wouldn 't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce .
 Whoa , whoa , Mrs. Hodge ?
 Things are getting a little bit complicated .
 Could you please tell Danielle that this is not gonna work out and that we --
 Mr. Faladi , if you want to break my daughter 's heart ,
 I can 't stop you , but I will not be an accomplice .
 You 'll tell her yourself . Right .
 - And don 't even think about blaming me , ' cause if you so much as mention that we spoke , I 'll phone the police .

 Fine , I will leave you out of it .
 Oh , and one more thing ... - Yes ?
 Danielle is applying to colleges .
 I do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation . Sure .


 And when I locked myself out of the house , that 's where the bush was that you found me in ... naked .
 Surely you remember that .
 Nope .
 Ouch , that hurts . Um , okay , remember this spot ?
 This is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss .
 Were you naked then , too ?

 ( sighs ) Mike , why are you being this way ? Because this is pointless .
 I ... I 'm sorry . I can 't -- I don 't remember being with you .
 Okay , I know it 's hard , but you gotta make an effort , and , you know , if your head is a little foggy , then don 't look there .
 Look in your heart , because I 'm in there , just like you 're inside mine .
 Okay , um , this is Mary Alice 's house , and this is where we first met .
 I was setting out my macaroni and cheese , and you were invited -- - Oh ! ow ! ( grunts ) I 'm good .
 Finally , a smile . You do that a lot , don 't you ? Well , yeah , I 've been known to take a spill or two , but , you know , my doctor says it 's an inner ear ...

 Wait , you remember that ?
 Yeah , I think I ... do .
 Yes ! That 's progress ! See ?
 Oh , it 's all gonna come back .
 We 're gonna be us again !
 But ... what about the British guy ?


 Mike ...
 I don 't know what Edie 's been telling you , but Ian and I -- we 're just friends .
 Just friends ?
 Yeah ... now .

 Look , you gotta understand .
 The doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up , and I just needed somebody to talk to .
 And that 's what you were doing in the country -- talking ? ( nurse ) Mr. Delfino ?
 Are you okay ? I 'm fine .
 You can 't just discharge a patient without permission !
 Oh , but you -- I was just trying to help him remember .
 Tell her , Mike .
 We were -- we were making progress .

 Take me back to the hospital .


 Oh , uh ... Mike !
 Well , at the risk of stating the obvious , it 's over .
 He 's mine now .
 No , no , no , no !
 No , no , this -- this is not how this ends .
 No , evil does not triumph over good . how you see me ? Damn straight !
 You lie , you cheat , you scheme !
 You ruin people 's relationships !
 I mean , how do you sleep at night ?
 Soon with Mike on top of me , if you know what I mean .
 See ? Evil !
 Evil ! has it ever occurred to you that maybe Mike and I are meant to end up together ?
 No ! You -- you -- Mike ?
 You don 't even want him ! You 're just doing this to hurt me . Wow .
 How self- absorbed can you be ?
 I have had a thing for Mike since the day he moved in here , and I even backed off when he fell for your little Miss Adorable act .
 But he 's over that .
 It 's my turn now , and I will be better for him than you ever were . and if you do get hurt ,
 Well ... ( chuckles ) that 's just gravy .

 All right , maybe was a little evil .

 Finally .
 Sorry it took so long .
 That last digit was barely legible .
 I thought you 'd like to do the honors .








 Whoa , a D- minus .
 That blows .
 - Yeah , it does , especially since it 's not the one we did together .
 You e- mailed me the wrong paper .
 You didn 't even read it before you turned it in ?
 I didn 't think I had to !
 The one you wrote that night was great . - Well , after you left ,
 I decided I really should put it in your words .

 Is this some weird chick thing you did 'cause you 're into me ?
 Oh , please . No , no .
 No , it is .
 You 're , uh , pissed 'cause I hooked up with your friend .
 No , I 'm pissed because you told me some sob story so I 'd write your paper for you .

 Now you owe me 15 bucks .

 You know what ?
 Here . Oh , and , uh , I learn something .

 Iago betrayed Othello because he was jealous .



 Oh , Danielle , I thought you 'd be with Mr. Faladi tonight .
 Oh , you 'll be happy to know he dumped me . he dumped you ?
 - Said it was getting too messy , that I was gonna complicate his divorce . Don 't pretend you 're sorry .
 I don 't plan to .
 Well , I hope this doesn 't make history class too awkward . Oh , you don 't have to worry about that .
 I went to the principal and got his ass fired , and then when he called to yell at me for squealing on him ,
 I recorded the call and sent a tape of it to his wife .
 Thanks to me , he 'll be getting nothing in this divorce .
 Well , I must say that was rather underhanded .
 Yes . I wonder where she gets it .
 ( Kayla ) Bye , Daddy .
 Bye , my chipmunk . I 'll see you guys next Friday , okay ?
 Kayla said that you 're opening a pizza place .
 Well , maybe . I mean , it 's not a done deal yet .
 Ah ...
 Lynette put the kibosh on it , huh ?
 What makes you say that ? ( chuckles ) Well , you know ...
 Lynette .
 Well , she 's probably right .
 I mean , there 's a bunch of dumb schmucks out there trying to open a restaurant , so ...
 - You know , Tom , I 've tasted your pizza , and I have to be perfectly honest with you .
 It was like I died and went to italy .
 Really ? Oh , my God .
 You are born to do this , and I just hate to see you give it up , because , well ...
 man , this is none of my business , but Lynette does ... bully you sometimes .
 Well , she doesn 't mean to . Then don 't let her ! You go to the mat on this one .
 She will respect you a lot more if you grow a pair .
 I 'm not trying to insult you .

 all I 'm saying is that ...
 I know what you 're capable of , and I believe in you .
 I really needed to hear that . ( chuckles ) Thanks .
