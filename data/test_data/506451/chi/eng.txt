 Mr. Cretites ?
 ... Paul Cretites .
 My name is Latimer .
 I 've come to meet you , Mr. Cretites .
 Just come this way , Mr. Cretites .
 We have a carriage waiting .

 During my long and intimate acquaintance ... ... with Sherlock Holmes ,
 I 'd never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life .
 Because of this reticence , I sometimes found myself ... ... regarding him as an isolated phenomenon ... ... as deficient in human sympathy ... ... as he was pre- eminent in intelligence .

 I 'd come to believe that he was an orphan ... ... with no relatives living .
 But one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his family .
 My singular gift of observation introduction ... ... may have come from my grandmother , who was a sister of Bernais , the French artist .
 The art in the blood ... ... is liable to take the strangest forms .
 For example , my brother , Mycroft .
 Your brother ?
 I didn 't know you had a brother ?
 Oh , yes .
 And I can assure you , he possesses a far greater faculty ... ... of observation and deduction than I do .
 Holmes , I know that you are a modest man
 Ha- ha . My dear Watson ,
 I cannot agree with those ... ... that rank modesty among the virtues .
 To the legation , everything should be seen exactly as it is .
 And to underestimate one 's self ... ... is as much a departure from the truth ... ... as to exaggerate one 's own ability .
 What I have just told you about my brother ... ... is the exact and literal truth .
 Well , naturally , I don 't doubt your word .
 But if there is another man in England ... ... with such singular powers , how is it that neither the police nor the public ... ... have ever heard of him , let alone myself ?

 He 's very well known in his own circles .
 Where then ?
 The Diagones Club .
 It is the oddest club in London , and my brother one of the oddest men .


 I suppose you wish to meet him ?
 Well , of course I do , even if it 's just to prove that he exists .

 Then you shall , this afternoon .
 He has come across the most singular problem , which he thinks might interest me . But why does Mycroft not use ... ... his great powers for detective work ?
 If the art of the detective began ... ... and ended in reasoning from an arm chair , my brother would be the greatest criminal agent ... ... that ever lived .
 What is to me a means of livelihood ... ... is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante .
 But he has no ambition and no energy .

 What is his profession , then ?
 He has an extraordinary faculty for figures .
 He audits the books ... ... for some of the government departments .
 But what are the qualifications ... ... for the Diogenes Club ?
 Shyness and misanthropy ... ... my brother is one of the founding members .
 It contains the most unsociable ... ... and clubful men in time who speak not a word ... ... and shun even the merest glance .
 Now , let us enter .
 Yes , but ... Not a word .





 Holmes , have you ...

 We can talk in here .
 Well , thank goodness .


 Look at those two men , Sherlock .
 What do you make of them ?
 The brilliant marker of the other .
 Precisely .
 What do you make of the other ?
 An old soldier , I perceive .
 And very recently distraught ? Served in India , I see .
 And a non- commissioned officer .
 Relativity , I fancy .
 And a widower ?
 With a child .
 Children , my dear boy , children .
 Ha- ha .
 Mycroft Holmes .
 Glad to meet you , Dr. Watson .
 I hear of Sherlock everywhere ... ... since you became his ...
 Well , thank you .
 For anyone who wishes to study mankind , this is the spot .
 But surely you were taking things ... ... a little too far just now ?
 It is not hard to say , Watson , that a man of that bearing , and especially of authority ... ... and some big skin as a soldier ... ... is more than a private , and is not long for India .

 That is not long since left the service ... ... shown by his still wearing his ammunition boots , as they 're called .
 He has not the cavalry stride , but he wore his hat on one side ... ... as is shown by the lighter skin ... ... on one side of his brow .


 His weight is against him being a sapper .
 He is in the artillery .
 There goes his complete mourning shows ... ... that he has lost someone very dear .
 The fact that he 's doing his own shopping ... ... looks as though it was his wife .
 He 's been buying things for children , as you can see .
 There is a wrap , which shows that one of them ... ... is very , very young .
 And the fact that he has a picture book under his arm ... ... shows there is another child .
 Aha , Mr. Merlas .
 Come in , sir .


 These are my friends .
 This is Dr. Watson , and this is my younger brother , Sherlock .
 You 're Mr. Sherlock Holmes ?
 I 've asked Mr. Merlas to step across .
 He lodges on the first floor above me , and I thought you 'd be interested in his story .
 He 's the reason why I asked you to call today .
 Mr. Merlas , he came to me , well ...
 But I think I shall ask Mr. Merlas to tell ... ... his own very remarkable experiences ... ... in his own fashion .
 Thank you , Mr. Holmes .
 For many years ,
 I have been the chief
 Greek interpreter in London .
 I do not think that the police believe my story . On my word , I do not .
 Just because they have never heard of it before , they think that such a thing cannot be .
 But I know that I shall never be easy in my mind ... ... until I know what has become of my poor man ... ... with a sticking plastered up on his face .
 Sticky ... Mr. Merlas , please sit down .
 Thank you , Mr. Holmes , I prefer to stand .
 Watson .
 I am all attention .

 All this happened only two days ago , on Monday night .
 I am Greek by instruction .
 And earn my living as an interpreter .
 It often happens that I 'm sent for at strange hours ... ... by foreigners who would get into difficulties ... ... or by travelers who would arrive late ... ... and wish my services .








 Mr. Merlas ?
 Yes ?
 I apologize for this intrusion , but I need the services ... ... of an interpreter immediately .
 My name is Latimer .
 Immediately ?
 I wouldn 't insist unless it were urgent , but a Greek friend of mine has just arrived ... ... in this country on business matter .
 Unfortunately , he speaks nothing ... ... but his own tongue .
 I likewise so .
 Mr. Merlas , please .
 My carriage is waiting outside .

 How far away ?
 Only to Kensington .








 I 'm sorry to have to cut off your view , Mr. Merlas , but the fact is , I have no intention that you ... ... should see the place to which we are driving .
 It might possibly be inconvenient to me ... ... if you were able to find your way back again .
 This is very extraordinary conduct , Mr. Latimer .
 You must be aware that what you 're doing ... ... is quite illegal .
 It is somewhat of a liberty , no doubt , but we 'll make it up to you .


 For nearly two hours , we drove , without my having the least idea as to where I was .
 Did you not notice any change ... ... of sound under the wheels ?
 I listened , Mr. Holmes .
 Sometimes we seemed to be on a paved causeway , sometimes on asphalt , but there was nothing to tell me where I was .
 And no other sounds ... ... a ship 's siren or church bell ?
 I 'm sorry , nothing like that .
 At what time ... ... did you finally reach your destination ?
 Ten minutes to 9 : 00 , exactly .











 Is this Mr. Merlas , Harold .
 Yes .
 Well done , Ha Ha Ha , well done .
 No ill will , Mr. Merlas , I trust , but we could not get on without you .
 If you deal fair with us , you 'll not regret it , but if you try any tricks , God help you .
 What do you want of me ?
 Only to ask a few questions ... ... of a Greek gentleman who 's visiting us , and to let us have the answers .
 But , you say no more than you are told , or it were better you had never been born .


 Mr. Merlas , pray continue .
 Well then , this man , this evil man , showed me to a room which appeared to be ... ... very curiously furnished .

 But again , the only light was afforded by a single lamp , half turned down .






 The slate , Harold .
 Are his hands loose ?
 Take this .
 You will ask the questions , Mr. Merlas , and he will write the answers .
 Ask him , first of all , whether he 's prepared to sign the papers ?





 ' Never . '
 On no conditions ?
 He writes , ' only if I see her married ... ... in my presence by a Greek priest , whom I know . '
 Ha Ha .
 You know what awaits you , then ?

 He says , 'I care nothing for myself . '
 And so it went on , again and again
 I had to ask him whether he would give in ... ... and sign the document .
 Again and again , I had the same indignant reply .
 But soon , a thought came to me .
 I took to adding on little sentences of my own ... ... to each question , innocent ones at first , to test whether either of our companions ... ... knew anything of the matter .
 And then , as I found that they showed no sign ,
 I played a more dangerous game .
 This obstinacy is doing you no good .




 He says , ' I care not . '


 In fact , he had also told me ... ... he was a stranger in London .
 He then told me he had been here three weeks , and was being forcibly starved . Starved ?
 Did you manage to find out his name ?
 Cretites .
 He was from Athens .
 But that was all I could discover , unfortunately .
 Another five minutes , and I should have wormed out ... ... the whole story under their very noses .
 Ask him again , Mr. Merlas .
 But at that instant , the door opened , and a woman stepped into the room .
 He says , 'never . '
 Well , ask him again .
 Harold , I could not stay away any longer .
 Sophia , Sophia , Sophia .




 That will do , Mr. Merlas .

 As you perceive , we have taken you into our confidence ... ... over some very private business .

 Here are five sovereigns , which will , I hope , be a sufficient fee .
 But remember , if you speak to anyone about this , one human soul , mind , well , may God have mercy on your soul .



 As before , I was taken in a closed carriage ... ... for almost two hours .
 There I was abandoned , as I was later to discover , near Wentsworth Common .


 I did not know where I had been , nor whom I had spoken with nor anything , saving what I have told you .
 But I know there is foul play going on , and I want to help that unhappy man ... ... before God , I do .







 Mycroft .
 Mycroft .
 Huh ? What steps have you taken so far ?
 Well , this was in all the daily papers :
 ' Anyone having information as to the whereabouts ... ... of a Greek gentleman named Paul Cretites , who cannot speak English , will be rewarded .
 As ever a reward will be paid to anyone ... ... having information about a Greek lady , whose first name is Sophia , ' but no answer as yet .
 What about the Greek Legation ?
 I have tried .
 They know nothing .
 The head of the Athens police , then .
 Sherlock has all the energy in the family .
 When you take up a case , by all means ,
 let me know if you do any good .
 Certainly .
 Mr. Merlas , sir .
 I should be extremely careful , if I were you , but of course , through these advertisements , they 'll know that you 've betrayed them .















 Whoops .
 On your way .
 It seems to me obvious that this Greek girl has been ... ... carried off by the young Englishman ,
 Harold Latimer .
 Carried off from where ? Athens , perhaps ?
 No , no , no ... this Harold Latimer ... ... cannot speak a word in Greek .
 The girl speaks English fairly well , inference that she has been in England some little time , and he has not been in Greece .
 Thank you Miss Jackson .
 Then , let 's presume that the girl ... ... was visiting in England and that this Harold ... ... persuaded her to fly with him .
 That is more probable .
 Then the brother , that must be the relationship , comes over from Greece in order to intervene , they see him , use violence to force him to sign some documents , making over the girl 's fortune to them .
 He 's probably the trustee .
 This , as we have heard , he refuses to do .
 So far .
 But these men will not stop now .
 Whatever happens , Watson , we must find them . How can we ?
 Well , if our conjecture is correct , and the girl 's name is ... or was ...
 Sophia Cretites , we should have no difficulty in tracing her .
 That must be our main hope .
 The brother , of course , is a complete stranger .




 Come in , Sherlock .
 Come in , sir .
 You don 't expect such energy from me , do you , Sherlock ... ... hmm ?
 Now , How did you get here ?
 I passed you while you were in the telegraph office .
 I had an answer to my advertisement .
 It came within a few minutes of your leaving .
 And what effect ?
 It is written with a Jay pen on royal cream paper ... ... by a middle- aged man with a weak constitution .
 ' Sir , in answer to your advertisement of today 's date ,
 I beg to inform you that I know the young lady ... ... in question very well .
 If you should care to call upon me ,
 I could give you some particulars ... ... as to her painful history .
 She 's at present at Memerkle 's Beckinum .
 Yours faithfully , Jay Davenport . '
 He writes from Lower Brigestone .
 Do you not think we should drive there now ... ... and learn these particulars ?
 My dear Mycroft .
 Her brother 's life is more important ... ... than the sister 's story .
 But we should call at Scotland Yard ... ... for Inspector Gregson ... ... and then go straight out to Beckinum , where we know that a man is being done to death ,
 Every hour maybe vital .
 Better pick up Mr. Merlas on the way ?
 Why ?
 Because we may need a Greek interpreter .
 Excellent , Watson .
 I should say from what we have heard , that we are dealing with ... ... a particularly dangerous guy .




 Mr. Merlas ?
 Yes .
 There 's a gentleman downstairs to see you , sir .
 What gentleman ?
 Well , he said he met you today at the Diogenes Club .

 Mr. Holmes . Thank you .






 Good evening , Mr. Merlas .













 Good evening , Mrs. Sterd ,
 Would you tell Mr. Merlas I need to see him urgently .
 Well , Mr. Merlas is not here , sir .
 A gentleman just called for him , and he left .
 Can you tell me where ?
 Oh , I don 't know , sir .
 All I know is , he drove off with a gentleman in a carriage .
 Did the gentleman give a name ?
 No , sir .
 He wasn 't a tall , handsome , dark , young man ? Oh , no , sir .
 He was a little gentleman , with glasses , thin in the face , but very pleasant in his ways .
 He was laughing all the time he was talking .
 Thank you .
 Scotland Yard , and hurry .
 It cannot be done without a warrant .
 We are not disputing that , Inspector .
 Even if they are criminals , it is a private house and the law demands ...
 The law demands that we act quickly .
 Can you not find a Magistrate ... ... to sign this warrant for us ?
 A this hour ?
 At this very minute ... ... our kidnapping could become murder .
 I can but try .
 Please do .








 Tell him , I have ceased being reasonable .
 If he does not sign the papers now ,
 I will kill him .
 Tell him I have no more patience .
 No .
 No .

 No .
 No .
 Please , Inspector ... ... will you not come without a warrant ?
 I am sorry , gentlemen ...
 We have wasted nearly an hour . The law cannot be hurried , Mr. Holmes .
 The life of Mr. Merlas is in your hands , Inspector .

 Tell him ... hmm ... tell him if I kill him ... ... I have no use anymore ... ... for his sister , and she will die , also . But you wouldn 't ...
 TELL HlM .



 Here it is , gentlemen ... it 's signed .
 Now get someone to drive us ... ... to London Bridge Station .
 I pray we 're not too late .








 A carriage heavily loaded with luggage ... ... has passed that within the last half- hour .
 Wait for us here .



 The nest is empty and the birds are flown .




 It 's sulfur .
 Mycroft , get the lamp .
 Come , help me with the bodies .
 Right .



 Quick .
 The poor wretch must be Paul Cretites .
 No more , I 'm afraid .
 His life is over .
 We should have been here sooner , Inspector .
 He must have been dead about four hours .
 The gas made of sulfur , am I not right , Dr. Watson ?
 Beaten to death .
 But Mr. Merlas still lives .
 Quick .
 Let 's get him out of here as fast as possible . Inspector , brandy . Relax , Mr. Merlas , you 're in safe hands .
 Get the ropes off him .
 From a brief look at her room , the lady left in haste , but without a struggle .
 That man Latimer must still have some power over her .
 One wonders , with how much remorse she abandoned her brother ... ... for Harold Latimer ?
 You still retain your low opinion of women ?
 In this instance , I cannot maybe justify .
 Holmes , they appear to have consulted a Bradshaw .
 Look at this page .

 The boat train .
 The murderers won 't get far .
 Have man at every port in England , if need be .
 The boat train makes one stop between London and Dover .
 At Hurn Hill in 23 minutes , precisely .
 Exactly .
 Stay with your chief witness , Inspector . You may need a statement from him .
 And he will need your help .
 A little brandy , and ammonia at frequent intervals .
 Mycroft , I 'm not built for running so hard .








 Tickets , please .
 Will you kindly have your tickets ready , please ?

 My name is Sherlock Holmes .
 Mr. Sherlock Holmes ?
 Well , I 've read about your cases , sir . Are we the last passengers ... ... from whom you have collected tickets ? Indeed , sir .
 I always work at the engine , start there , and work my way back to the garden .
 Then you can help me .
 There are three passengers , two men and a woman , traveling together .
 They may not appear to be companions , but they will be in a compartment alone .
 The elder man wears thick- lensed glasses , and the younger one is quite handsome .
 They will have a great deal of luggage marked ... ... for the Continent .
 Have you seen such a party ?
 Yes , indeed , I can help you , Mr. Holmes .
 I never doubted it .
 There are two parties ... ... who fit that description , Mr. Holmes .
 Two ?
 Ticket , please .
 In Compartment B4 ...
 B4 . ... and D8 . Thank you , Inspector .
 How do you know which two are the murderers ?
 It couldn 't be simpler .
 No , don 't wake him .
 There 's danger enough for the two of us .
 A left- handed printer from Detford .
 His older brother drinks too much ... ... and is pained by his liver . Can 't harm mine then .
 Whatever .

 And the girl ?
 She knows neither of them , she 's a machinist from Bradford ... ... who 's going on a Holiday ... ... to find romance .
 Which means , undoubtedly , the murderers aren 't in Compartment B4 .

















 Thank you , Miss Cretites .
 Do sit still , Mr. Latimer .
 Do come in , Watson .
 Who the hell are you ?
 The third member of the party is absent , but I 'm sure he will return .







 Miss Cretites , may I ask ... ... if you are this man 's prisoner or companion ?
 Don 't say anything .
 They have no right to ask you anything at all .
 If they were the police , they would have said so .
 Why the police , Mr. Latimer ?
 Were you expecting to meet them ?
 Look , I don 't know who you are , nor do I know how you know my name , but I 'm traveling with my fiancèe ... ... to the Continent to get married .
 So , would you please leave us alone ?
 Otherwise , I shall be obliged to call a guard .
 Please do .
 I 'm sure Dr. Watson would do it for you .
 Ah , I see you know who I am ?
 Then may I be permitted to ask ... ... your fiancèe the question again ?
 It 's true what he said . We are going to be married ?
 Where ? In Athens . I fear not .
 And who is going to stop us ?
 If not the police , then I will .
 Miss Cretites , do you seriously want me to believe ... ... that you are leaving England willingly ?
 Yes .
 To marry the man who has just murdered your brother ?
 That 's not true .
 No . Murdered ?
 It isn 't true , is it ?
 He 's going to meet us in Greece as soon as he 's well .
 That 's what you said to me .
 And he will Sophia , he will .
 Your brother is dead , Miss Cretites .
 Don 't listen to him .
 I found his body myself in the house in Beckinum .
 He had been murdered . tortured to death .
 No , it can 't be .
 Harold , tell me what 's happened .
 As for you , Mr. Latimer ,
 Mr. Merlas is alive as a witness to see you hanged .






 Help me , Sophia , help me .
 Help me .
 Help me .














 ... went very well , very well indeed .
 I have friends dead .
 Yes , but I need not elaborate , as I see you are a man of the world , sir ?
 On the contrary ...
 I 've never left England in my life .
 Haven 't you ?
 No .
 Then sir , if you must choose one country , it must be Greece ... ... the land of Gods , olives and intrigue .
 It is my destination , Greece .
 Do you speak Greek , sir ?
 No , but one can always find a good interpreter .
 Thank you .
 An excellent meal . well , good bye , sir .
 It was a pleasure meeting you .
 Well , good bye .
 It was an interesting conversation .
 I do apologize .
 Sometimes , I forget my size .

 Goodbye again .
 Is it true about Paul ?
 I 'm afraid so .
 I hated Harold Latimer .
 I hated him , and I loved him .
 I would have done anything he said .
 I would have gone anywhere with him .
 Even though he murdered your brother ?
 Yes , even then .

 Mr. Cana , we were expecting you .


 I believe this is your revolver , sir ?








 Well , brother of mine ... ... we seem to be heading down the path of crime .
 The only path I intend to take ... ... is the door to the Diogenes Club , which I will close behind me .
 What will become of her ?
 After questioning , nothing .
 There 's not a crime to her cold heart , and not a single shred of compassion .
