 Bruce Lee , he knows the anatomy .

 Without power , the opening doesn 't mean squat .

 MAN 2 :
 Ali was the heavyweight champ .
 He 's got a hundred pounds on Lee . MAN 1 :
 Bruce feints for Ali 's head .
 But he goes low and sweeps him to the deck .
 Ali goes down hard .

 I think I owe you the truth about Chuck .
 Those lanterns .
 He was living in that house without electricity for two years .
 He knew how to use those lanterns .
 He was careful .
 I saw it .
 I know you did too .
 There was never a problem .
 I know it 's a terrible thing to ...


 I don 't think what happened was an accident .

 You probably heard Chuck was retiring from HHM .
 But that 's not the truth .
 The truth is that we had a disagreement ... ... and I pushed him out .
 I made him go .
 Chuck was sick for years . And after the bar hearing ...
 The bar hearing had nothing to do with it .
 Okay .
 The fact is , he started getting better after that .
 He took more of an interest in the firm .
 He came to work .
 We left the lights on .
 He was improving until the thing with the insurance , it wasn 't the bar hearing .
 The insurance ?
 It was a ridiculous thing .

 I should 've just let it go .
 I mean , God knows he 's done enough for me .
 But he kept pushing and I , um ...
 I got my back up .
 What about the insurance ?
 HOWARD :
 It was , uh , our malpractice insurance . They found out about Chuck 's condition , raised our rates .
 Chuck went ballistic .
 He wanted to go to war .
 I drew a line .
 He wouldn 't back down .
 So I forced him out .


 It never occurred to me that I could hurt him .
 He always seemed so strong .
 But he wasn 't .
 I think he did what he did because of me .


 Well , Howard , I guess that 's your cross to bear .

 Look at her go .
 So I 'm gonna make coffee .
 Anybody want some ?
