 00 : 00 : 00, 001 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 657 - Previously , on The Originals ... - You 're a wolf . Why aren 't you healing ?
 A monster is still a biological organism . - So , I devised a treatment .
 - If you found a way to weaken yourself , maybe you can help me find a way to kill Marcel Gerard .
 Maxine . It 's Adam . He never came home .
 Adam Folsom was your only case . We got three additional reports of missing kids .
 Eight years ago , you were running this city with an iron fist .
 I start looking for forms of magic that you can 't defend against .
 Sacrificial magic .
 You freed it , Vincent . And now , it must be fed .
 I 'm so cold .
 That witch , he used their personal items to bind them to the spell .
 Hope Mikaelson is linked to that spell . We got to cast a cleansing spell on New Orleans soil . She 's gonna die .

 Paramedics took the kids to the hospital to get checked out .
 NOLA PD will notify the parents .
 Hell of a sight . Powerful man overlooking his city .
 I wonder if I could convince you to change your view ?
 Oh , not that you aren 't stunning , 'cause you are , I 'm just , um ...
 I 'm having trouble shaking off the day that I had .
 So ... you 're saying you could use a distraction ?
 Allow me to distract .
 Mm .
 Just ignore it . No , just one second .
 Yeah . All right .
 Come in ...
 Marcel , we got a problem .
 Those kids . They never made it home . What are you talking about ?
 I loaded those kids into the ambulance myself . The ambulance is missing too .
 The children are sedated . I 've already prepared them . For the rich 'll .
 A token of our master 's power . You 'll need it for what 's to come .
 Just one last thing . Your friend . Vincent Griffith .
 I won 't let anything stop us .
 Our home . Once the pride of our family , now a flophouse .
 Indeed , the mighty have fallen . Where 's Vincent ?
 Right here .
 Kept my word .
 Now the only question is whether or not you guys are gonna keep yours .
 As soon as I 'm finished healing your kid , you got to leave the city .
 Well , we 're not gonna stay , are we ? Your city has lost its charm .
 What he means to say is that we 're very grateful , just ... help her and we 'll leave .
 Just give us what we need , and we will do so , happily .
 Excuse me .
 Okay ...
 Nettoyer timoun sa a .
 Nettoyer timoun .
 Nettoyer timoun sa a .
 Nettoyer ...
 Oh ...
 Mom ?
 - That 's it . - Oh ! - Your little girl 's purified .
 - Thank you .
 Now look , the only gratitude I need from any of you is seeing you leave the city .
 Go see your daddy .
 What is this ? I don 't know .
 Mom ? Can you hear that ?
 It 's ... whispers . Saying a name . Over and over .
 Kre Nah Han ... Kre Nah Han ...
 Vincent , what ... what is that ?
 It 's a nearly forgotten dialect .
 It 's Creole . It means the Hollow .
 The Hollow is coming .
 How is she ? Uh , the fever 's back . But she 's not in any pain .
 - She 's asking for you . - Well , make an excuse .
 I 'd rather my daughter not know I 've gone off to murder witches .
 - We can not be reckless , Niklaus . - And how would you have me respond ?
 Should I delegate my child 's safety to someone else ? Let me see what I can do .
 And I will handle Marcel .
 Out of the three of us , I win Most Likely Not to Get Killed on Arrival .
 Whatever we 're up against , it 's as much his problem as is it ours .
 Leaving me to do what , exactly ? Stay here and protect our daughter .
 Do not let anything or anyone near her .
 A word of warning . The Marcel that you knew is gone .
 So , whatever he is now , he 's no ally .
 Mm .
 Oh , I guess I feel asleep working .
 Did you get any ? I just woke up from a five- year nap .
 You going somewhere ?
 New Orleans . Hope is still sick . Klaus asked me to see what I can do .
 Great , um ...
 So long as you 're stepping into a war zone , see if you can 't get your hands on Marcel 's venom .
 Klaus did say that Marcel would be occupied .
 We can enter his home , steal whatever we need , - and leave before anyone notices .
 - Okay . You want me to help you rob the most deadly vampire on the planet ?
 I will pass .
 If you 're worried about a fight ... allow me to even the odds .
 The stone is kyanite .
 It 's been spelled to grant you total control of your werewolf nature , even during a full moon .
 This is a cure . It 's everything I 've ever wanted .
 What 's the catch ? Not a catch . Insurance .
 Yeah . More like a leash , spelled so that I can 't take it off .
 Like you said . It 's everything you ever wanted .
 Provided you help me .
 How are you feeling ? I 'm still so cold .
 Are the birds gone ? Yeah . They 're gone , sweetheart .
 And when you 're better , which will be soon , you and I are going to share the biggest plate of beignets you 've ever seen .
 And you can tell me where in this big , wide world you 'd like me to take you next .
 Mom said you loved New Orleans most of all .
 I did , once .
 But putting your love in a place is a mistake .
 Being here in our home , seeing these walls ,
 I am reminded that it is people who are best suited to fill our hearts .
 Dad . I don 't feel so good .
 Look , guys . I know what we 're up against . There 's a faction of our own people , witches .
 They 've started to make human sacrifices to a spirit called the Hollow .
 Now , this thing is dark , it 's angry , it 's very powerful .
 It is a force my family and I are here to erase .
 - Does not ! - Now , kindly excuse us , please .
 Mr. Griffith and I have much to discuss .
 Okay , uh ... Give me a minute .
 So , now that we 've dispensed with the needless hysteria ...
 I got a lot on my plate , Elijah , without whatever trouble you 're trying to bring my way .
 You need me .
 And fortunately , I have a long history of removing anything undesirable from New Orleans .
 I 'm probably one of the things that 's on your list .
 So I reckon it 's best for me work alone .
 Oh , it 's not an offer . Children 's lives are at risk .
 You care about children 's lives at risk ? What about Davina Claire , Elijah ?
 So , you can only see me as some kind - of merciless butcher . - Yes .
 - I do .
 - I 'll be whatever you want me to be , Vincent Griffith .
 I 'll be the very devil himself , but make no mistake ,
 I would violate everything sacred under the sun in the name of rescuing my niece .
 And right now , according to you ... you are facing two evils .
 Wouldn 't it be nice to have one of those by your side ?
 We 're gonna do this my way . Beautiful . Your way it is .
 Listen up . Listen up .
 For five years now , we 've had a truce .
 Stayed out of each other 's business . Tended to our own .
 But now , your problems are becoming mine .
 Someone is taking children .
 As you know , I have one nonnegotiable rule : we do not mess with kids .
 Now , you 've seen that graffiti .
 Someone here 's got to know who 's responsible .
 Right ? So just give me a name .
 Hmm ?
 We don 't owe you anything .
 You 're no friend to witches . You don 't trust him .
 I get it .
 But one of those kids is my daughter . She 's seven .
 She likes to paint , catch fireflies , make up stories .
 All I know is that she 's sick . Right now , I don 't care about the past .
 I 'm just a mom asking you to help me .
 There 's a girl named Lara .
 I saw her draw the same symbol on her window in blood .
 Where do I find this witch ? She 's not a witch .
 She 's one of your kind . A wolf .
 She ran off to the bayou .
 Nice job on the lock . You 'd make a good cat burglar .
 All magic is just opening locks and finding loopholes .
 So tell me again : why don 't you just tell your family about our little secret project ?
 They 're overly sensitive when it comes to Marcel .
 Oh , not you , though , huh ?
 The merciless badass who doesn 't get sentimental about anyone .
 Somebody 's got to be the big sister .
 Okay . Since you are so in love with taking charge , where do we look ?
 Marcel stockpiled Klaus ' blood . No doubt he did the same with his venom .
 He would keep that someplace safe .
 You know , that ring enhances your instincts . Why not try using them ?
 Sorry , I don 't do bloodhound . Fine , we 'll do it my way .
 And who might this be ?
 These are the ashes of a witch that lost his way and it might just be the key to helping us find ours .
 This thing , um , the Hollow ... its magic has a very unique signature .
 I felt it on this witch the other day when Marcel and I took him out , so if I can trace that energy back to its source ...
 You can find the rest of these fanatics .
 So this thing which haunts my niece ... has it spoken to you ?
 It 's more like , um , a broadcast .
 And I was able to shut it out , but a lot of people have a harder time doing that .
 Like your wife .
 You know , there 's a difference between what we project and what we have inside of our hearts , what we try to hide inside of our hearts , right ?
 Now that thing , it took everything that 's dark and twisted inside of me and it used it against me .
 It used it again my wife and it ended up taking everything that I 've ever loved away from me .
 So , then , you have every reason - to want to remove it from this earth .
 - Yeah . But let 's say that we run into that thing today , Elijah .
 It 's gonna take everything that you want to keep buried , it 's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do .
 And that 's what makes you a liability to the very niece that we 're both trying to protect .
 Let 's get to work .
 That man , Vincent ... Mom said he was a witch .
 That he came to help me feel better . But I feel worse .
 I know . I know .
 But don 't worry , because as we speak , your mother and your Uncle Elijah are working with Vincent to fix you up .
 So you just stay calm and they 'll make everything all right .
 Do you know what it is ? The Hollow ?
 No , sweetheart ... I don 't .
 It wants those other kids . I can feel them .
 I think it wants me , too . I am not gonna let anything take you .
 I promise you that . I 'm going to keep you safe , always and forever .
 Chèche in virtute .
 Chèche in virtute , chèche in virtute .
 Chèche in virtute .
 What is it ? Vincent , what did you see ?
 How is she ? She 's sleeping .
 Freya will be here soon to stir up one of her medicinal concoctions .
 Tell me you have answers .
 Marcel and I have a lead . A wolf who got caught up with the Hollow .
 A wolf involved in witch business ? Crazy , I know .
 I want to ask her a few questions .
 Well , regardless of her excuses or your loyalties , I expect you to show this traitor the error of her ways .
 I 'll handle it .
 She 's not gonna want to talk to a vampire . - I 'll go .
 - The thing is , the last time I came across one of the Hollow 's goons , the guy tried to kill me , so ... fair warning .
 Lara ?
 My name 's Hayley . I don 't know if ... I know who you are .
 Hayley Marshall .
 I know why you 're here .
 You 're here because of the children .
 I 'm sorry . I am .
 They 're as good as dead .
 Weird time to have a drink , bud .
 Should be out looking for those kids .
 Yeah .
 I 'm a little upside- down , Will .
 I got this , um , evil mojo just breathing down my back .
 And it 's the same thing that took out my wife ... then it took me out ... and now I think it 's trying to take out my best friend .
 Was this your plan , Vince ?
 Invite me here , confront me ?
 Whatever this thing promised you , - it 's not gonna deliver .
 - You 're wrong . The Hollow rewards those who are loyal .
 Maybe if you did what it asked you to do , things might be different .
 For me . For Cami . For all of us .
 Is that what it told you , Will ?
 That 's what it showed me , Vince . Look at this city !
 It 's overrun with evil .
 And the only way to take it back is to do one little evil thing myself .
 This is not what you are ! You can walk away from this .
 I can help you walk away from this . You can 't help me .
 You can 't even help yourself . Don 't you see ?
 You 're in the middle of everything that 's to come . Which is why they sent me here , Vince .
 For you .
 That 's quite the monster you got lurking in there .
 You want to see mine ?
 I know you can hear me . I want you to listen .
 The heart which beats in your chest is a warrior 's heart .
 The heart of a Mikaelson .
 Whatever hold this power has over you , it is nothing compared to your strength .
 Yours is a power greater than you know .
 Come on .
 Hope ...
 Dad ?
 I saw them . The other kids .
 They 're so scared .
 Promise me if you ever see the blue lights , don 't look at them .
 I can 't open it , which means this is exactly what we were looking for .
 Well , before you blow it open with a magic bomb , just keep in mind that they 're gonna know that we were here .
 Well , do you have a better idea ? Because my family needs me .
 - And I 'm out of time for this . - Go help your niece .
 I 've got super- duper wolf hearing .
 I will crack the safe and if there 's anything that we can use , - I 'll grab it . - Keelin , if you try to run ....
 I know . You 'll make me turn all hairy . I got the threat the first time .
 You just go . Help your family . I 'll meet you wherever you tell me to .
 All right , someone cast a spell to block his mind against your vampire tricks , all right ?
 I can break that , Elijah , it 's just gonna take me a little bit of time
 - That 's a luxury we don 't have . - Look , Elijah , I 'm not gonna let you torture him , all right ?
 He 's my friend and he 's just as much of a victim as all those kids .
 You have five minutes .
 We 're not here to hurt you .
 You can 't hurt me any more than I 've already hurt myself .
 I didn 't know this was gonna happen .
 I didn 't know they were gonna - bring children into it .
 - It 's okay . Just tell us who " they " are .
 Those that serve the Hollow . Followers of the blue light .
 I thought we were doing something good . Trying to take back our city .
 Back from what ? From him .
 From the vampires .
 For five years we kept quiet . Watching you lord over this city like it was yours .
 Hey , I spent the last five years keeping the peace ...
 It is not your city to rule !
 New Orleans belongs to all of us .
 And the Hollow offered us the power we needed .
 So long as we pledged our allegiance .
 But Lara , you 're a Crescent . You have the pack , you don 't need this cult .
 You were gone .
 You chose the Original Family over your own kind .
 Don 't you see ? Our pack means nothing .
 You mean nothing ! You 're right . I wasn 't there .
 But I have a daughter now . And , Lara , she 's one of the kids .
 She 's one of the kids that 's in danger .
 So , please , help us help them .
 You can 't help them . The Hollow wants power .
 The kind that only comes from sacrifice . Those kids will die so it can get stronger .
 And it will feed . And it will rise . And we will all bow before it .
 The great beast .
 Even you .
 My only mercy is I won 't be here to see it .
 Briser ...
 Briser le bouchlier .
 Briser le bouchlier .
 Briser le bouchlier .
 - Briser le bouchlier .
 - Time 's up . - Hold on , Elijah !
 - Why do you insist ? Because he 's my friend .
 And because a witch told me that I 'm the one that gave this thing breath .
 Now I don 't know what I did to let it into this world , but I know I ain 't just gonna let it take him out .
 Finish it .
 Marquer nonm sa a .
 Marquer nonm sa a .
 There 's no going back , Vince .
 Any other wonderful ideas ?
 I tagged him with magic , so now we can trace him .
 Right back to the kids . Let 's go .
 Oh ...
 Yeah ...
 Assume you told everybody to be on their best behavior ?
 Oh , I told them .
 Now whether or not they 'll be obedient is another thing altogether .
 - Where 's Hope ? - Freya 's with her now .
 She 's fighting it . Whatever it is .
 The kids are attached to that spell : if we save the kids , we save your little girl .
 And the sooner you all can be on your way .
 Clearly , we 're skipping all the hugs and hellos . Vincent ?
 Trail leads off this way , so , I guess we , uh , follow the breadcrumbs .
 Tactless savages holding a ghost- raising rave .
 Best make short work of them .
 - I say we ... - We split up .
 Klaus , you 're with me , I 'm not letting you out of my sight .
 Anybody got a problem with that ...
 I don 't give a damn .
 I assume you embark upon this journey out of the kindness - of your heart ?
 - There are kids in trouble . Yours included .
 It 's a bit late for you to suddenly care about my child , given you left her fatherless for five years .
 Well , speaking from experience , I figured I was doing her a favor .
 Careful . Lest your insults mar an already tentative peace .
 All right , listen , I don 't care about our peace , all right ?
 I care about finding these missing kids and wiping out the messed up people who took them .
 Root out the problems , make them go away . That 's what you do when you 're the king .
 All I see is a petulant prince . Always with the insults . You never do learn .
 On the contrary . My time in your dungeon clarified my priorities .
 My concerns are with my child . And as for you ,
 I can imagine no better revenge than leaving you to the endless struggle to prove yourself my better .
 You 're welcome , by the way .
 So you knew this Crescent girl ? I did .
 But whatever that was today , that wasn 't her .
 She said something about blue light . Yeah , that 's the Fifolet .
 New Orleans legend says that a spirit might present itself in a bright blue ball of light .
 Wonderful . How do we kill it ? We 'll find out soon enough .
 Now that you 've returned , brother , you may join us as we claim our power .
 Our rightful place .
 And lay waste to all who would deny our master .
 Are you prepared to prove your loyalty - to the Hollow ?
 - I know what I have to do . I 'm not afraid .
 We should begin .
 Enough with this circus of sadists .
 Hey , we got to get the kids . Get the kids !
 Okay , here .
 Vinculum mond sa .
 Vinculum mond sa .
 Will ? Will ! Come on , man .
 - It 's over . - No , Vince . It 's only just begun .
 You can 't stop what 's coming .
 No !
 Oh , man , we got this all wrong . They wanted us here .
 Why ?
 They want to channel your power , and anchor the Hollow to the living world .
 Okay , they 're alive .
 These kids are linked to that ritual .
 We can 't free Marcel and Klaus unless we break the spell .
 How do we stop this ? I don 't know !
 It 's a sacrificial ritual . I can 't break it unless I kill one of the kids .
 No , no . There has to be another way .
 Where are we ?
 Don 't look into the blue light .
 Yeah , um ... so these kids are powering that ritual .
 But there might be a loophole , if I link it to you .
 Are you suggesting we take my life ? I 'm suggesting we stake you with wood .
 You die , temporarily , and that might be enough to break the spell .
 What is this ?
 Shut your eyes .
 Mare .
 Mare leurs .
 Mare leurs esprits .
 Mare leurs esprits !
 Mare leurs esprits !
 Mare leurs esprits !
 Mare leurs esprits !
 Look away !
 Hayley , do it now !
 Did it work ?
 Hope .
 We 're not cold anymore .
 Come back for one last look ?
 This place ... this city ... a lot of tragedy happened here .
 A lot I regret . But Hope was born here .
 So there was good with all that bad .
 After everything that 's happened , the city is yours .
 I hope it brings you peace .
 Good- bye , Marcel .
 Do one thing for me .
 Tell your daughter she doesn 't need to fear me .
 She never did .
 Glad you showed up . It 's not like I had much of a choice .
 Keelin ... - You have to understand ....
 - Look , maybe you and yours do it differently , but ... where I 'm from , you make a deal , you keep it .
 And since I am on the most wanted list of every psycho who wants your family dead ,
 I guess I 'm Team Mikaelson whether I like it or not .
 Denne legatura .
 It 's done .
 The ring 's altered . You keep the benefits , minus the leash .
 Is this an apology or a thank you ?
 I don 't know .
 I 'm not particularly good at either one .
 I managed to find an old friend . Or enemy , I can never really tell .
 Here 's to a wretched day .
 A wretched day indeed .
 As soon as Hope is better , we 'll leave . She 's all that matters .
 Hey .
 I want to ask you something .
 In the woods , if Vincent hadn 't found that loophole ... what would you have done to those kids ?
 Whatever I had to do .
 We have got to stop making it a habit of putting our family lives ahead of others .
 I don 't want that for myself , I don 't want that for Hope .
 We have to do better .
 I know today was rough for you . Hey , at least we put an end to it .
 Kinney 's dead .
 But ... the thing they idolized ... the Hollow ... it must have wanted us there .
 It wanted to come into our world by anchoring itself to one of us .
 So that makes me wonder ... did we end it ?
 Or is it just getting started ?
 You think it 's gonna come after me ?
 Marcel , I 'm- a tell you , man . I wonder if it hasn 't already got to you .
 What did you see when you was in the circle ?
 Nothing .
 Not a thing .
 I hope you 're right .
 That 's the funny thing about our city , though , Marcel .
 Nothing ever stays buried .
 No , no , no .
 It 's here .
 The Hollow ... it 's here .
