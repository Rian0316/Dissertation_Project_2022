 All right , kid , let 's hear the story .
 From the beginning .
 Well , it all started a week ago .


 Nothing sexier than a man in a fine cravat .
 Except for a woman who appreciates a fine cravat .
 How about we just call it a tie ?
 ( both laughing ) ( chuckling )
 You see , a cravat is a kind of tie .
 I get it .
 Anyway , next thing you know , I get her back to my place .
 Barney ... when I get in bed with a man , my body becomes a machine fueled by desire , lust and a singular hunger to satisfy my lover 's every carnal need .

 Good thing the cleaning lady 's coming tomorrow .
 Well , good night .
 What ?
 Wait , what ?
 I thought your body was going to become a machine fueled by desire , lust and a singular hunger to satisfy my every carnal need .
 No . Transcript by Addic7ed . com ( all laughing )
 You know , I really think that Don and I are hitting our stride as a news team .
 Yeah . DON : Well , all credit goes to this lady on my left .
 Oh , come on .
 That story you did on which rodents to avoid on the subway ...
 The answer may surprise you .
 It 's all of them .
 ( chuckling )
 Well , I got to run , okay ?
 I 'll see you . Okay . It 's good to meet you .
 Yeah , you , too .
 Take care .
 Okay .
 Bye , Don .
 Okay , Robin , that guy is awesome .
 He 's funny , he 's smart , he 's handsome .
 You got to scoop him up before someone else does .
 I hope you 're not talking about you .
 It has been four months since you broke up with Barney .
 Maybe it 's time to put yourself back out there .
 Yeah , exactly .
 Barney 's dating again , and he couldn 't be happier .
 I couldn 't be more unhappy .
 All night long , she 's hot and heavy for me .
 I get her back to my place , and she just bolts ?
 I mean , at least when I run out on a girl ,
 I have the common courtesy to sleep with her first .
 It 's ... it 's called manners .
 Sounds like she
 What ?
 It ... it 's this book that helps single girls find a husband .
 It 's Robin 's copy .
 I 've just ... I leafed through it a little bit .
 Really .
 Were you getting a mani- pedi ? ( all talking over each other )
 Okay , okay , okay .
 Fine .
 Barney , when you were with this girl , did she subtly slip the word " sex " into conversation ?
 I 'm in the inter- sex- tion , and I only have a couple of sex before the light changes .
 I mean , everyone 's honking at me , and it totally sex , but I can 't turn around because a jogger slipped and fell in horse sex- crement .
 Go on .
 Go on .
 Did she make excuses to establish physical contact with you ?
 Is this cashmere ?
 Cashmere ? ( scoffs )
 This is hand- spun virgin merino .
 The fibers in this suit are less than 12 microns thick .
 12 microns .
 I love a tiny fiber .
 Well , you 're in luck , because mine 's the tiniest .
 And the more you touch it , the softer it gets .
 ( chuckles softly )
 She did that , too .
 Now , here is the final test .
 Next time you see her , ask her out for the following night .
 The book says that 's forbidden , so she 'll probably give you some lame excuse like this :
 " Ooh , I can 't do anything tomorrow night . "
 I 've already made plans to clean my garbage disposal and treat myself to a bubble bath .
 BOTH :
 But how about next week sometime ?
 BARNEY :
 Aha !




 And ... it scares away guys who are only interested in getting laid .
 Why not just say you have a kid ?
 You 'd be surprised how many jerks there are out there .
 That 's why the book says never sleep with a guy on the first date .
 Totally . Or the second date .
 Of course .
 Or the third date .
 Well ...
 Or the fourth date .
 Well , just tell me how many dates !
 Seventeen . S ...
 S ...
 Excuse me , is anyone using this ?
 Yep , here it is : no sex until after 17 dates .
 Barney , if you 're not going to take her out on 17 dates ,
 LlLY :
 I think you should just give it up .
 Oh , no .
 I 'm not the one who 's going to give it up .
 She is .
 Because , thanks to Ted 's book ...
 That 's Robin 's .
 It 's Robin 's . ... I can stay two steps ahead of her at all times .
 There 's a loophole in here somewhere , and I 'm going to find it .
 ( phone rings )
 Hello .
 Hey , Robin .
 Oh , hey , Don .
 Listen , uh ... do you want to go out Saturday night ?
 Saturday night ... ( hushed ) :
 Is he asking you out ? Say yes ! Say yes !
 Look , Don , um ...
 listen , it ... it 's really sweet of you to ask , and you 're a great guy ... ( falsetto ) :
 Yes , I will go out with you .
 Robin , are you okay ?
 Um , I just had a little cold .
 That 's probably what you 're hearing .
 But Saturday night sounds great .
 We can even go to a steak house , and you can bring home some prime rib for my friend , Marshall .
 Okay , gotta go . Love you .
 Bye .
 What the hell are you thinking ?
 Robin , you 've got to do this , okay ?
 A great guy like Don is rare .
 And speaking of rare , prime rib - don 't forget .
 Thank you .
 Oh , my God .
 I don 't believe it .
 Guys ... this is her !
 She wrote the book .
 Huh .
 Her name must be Anita .
 Okay .
 My plan was to sleep with her , but this changes everything .
 New plan : I 'm going to sleep with her .
 Boy , this girl that Barney 's going after , she kind of sounds like the anti- Barney . I love how the universe decided to bring those two together . Mmm .

 Actually , Anita 's going after Barney because I told her to .
 Wait , you sicced Anita on Barney ?
 How do you even know her ?
 She was on my show .
 But , um , if you had to summarize your book in 30 words or less ...
 I 'll summarize it in one word , Robin .
 And that word is " no . "
 By saying no constantly and consistently , you empower yourself while simultaneously turning any jerk into a submissive , sniveling , puddle of a man .
 Hmm .
 And isn 't that every girl 's dream ? ( chuckling )
 After the break , we 're going to talk about your new book ,


 We 'll be right back .
 We 're clear .
 You guys want any coffee ?
 Oh , you know what , Mike , that 'd be great .
 You ?
 No .
 What about you , Robin ? You dating anyone ?
 Oh .
 ( chuckles )
 Dating 's not really my bag right now .
 Uh- oh .
 Did somebody break your heart ?
 And then , I - I told her everything .
 It just came pouring out .
 And by the end of it , she said ...
 This Barney needs to be taught a lesson .
 You say the word , and I will destroy him .
 What do you mean ?
 I can use the power of " no " to break your friend , Barney .
 Just say the word .
 Come on , that- that stuff doesn 't really work , does it ?
 I didn 't know what you wanted , so I got you a cappuccino , an espresso , a latte , a decaf ...
 Oh , hi , Robin .
 And this is a Turkish coffee .
 Thank you , Mike .
 Think about it .

 Oh , this Pilates instructor was off the charts .
 Picture Robin , but younger .
 And bigger boobs .
 Maybe not bigger , but more shapely .
 And bigger .
 ( phone rings ) Hello ?
 I get her up against the StairMaster , and we ... BARNEY : Do it .
 Spoilers .
 Anyway , we do it . It 's done .
 Thank you , Mike .
 I know , it was stupid , but you have to understand , back then , I was still really upset about the breakup .
 I was going though my mourning period .
 There was a lot of scotch and a lot of long nights at the shooting range .
 I hope those weren 't the same nights . ROBlN :
 Geez , Lily .
 It 's not like I remember all of them .
 Hey , babe .
 Did you know that Robin was going through a mourning period ?
 I mean , she seemed fine after the breakup .
 Oh , you know how she is .
 She tries to keep her emotions to herself .
 But yeah , I caught her crying a couple times .
 She cried ?
 Like , real tears ?
 But that means ...
 Oh , no .

 Exactly .
 Barney 's dating again , and he couldn 't be happier .
 I mean , that guy has been active .
 Sexually .
 I mean , he 's just been , like , bang , bang , bang !
 You know ?
 ( chuckling ) :
 It 's like ... bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang !
 Bang , bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang Bang , bang , bang
 Bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang .
 How could you let me do that ?
 You 're my wife , you 're supposed to stop me from embarrassing myself in public .
 I know , but that song 's kind of catchy .
 Bang , bang , bangity bang Bang , bang , bangity bang
 I said bang , bang , bangity bang A- bang , bang , bangity bang .
 Damn it .
 I 've read that thing cover to cover , and I can 't find a loophole .
 What am I going to do ?
 Well , there is one other option , but , uh , nah , you 're not ready . Tell me .
 Well , if you have to seal the deal in just one date , it 's got to be one doozy of a date , right ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm not talking dinner and a movie .
 I 'm not talking mini- golf .
 I 'm talking ... 17 dates worth of romance wrapped up into one incredible night .
 I 'm talking about ... a superdate .
 A superdate ? Mm- hmm .
 That sounds kind of lame .
 What if we call it a megadate ?
 If you want my help , it 's a superdate . All right .
 Leave it to me .
 I 'll plan the whole thing .


 I bet it 'll be all gooey and romantic , huh ?
 Gooey and romantic ?
 Gooey and romantic ?
 Barney ...
 You don 't have to take her
 To Paris or Peru
 Uh , Ted , what are you doing ?
 You just have to make her understand
 Ted , people are looking at us .
 What she means to you
 Oh , God , really ?
 You 're really going to do this right now ?
 On your superdate
 Troubles of the world will simply have to wait
 For wonders and amazement Served upon a silver plate
 Hurry up now , don 't be late
 'Cause hand in hand you 'll find a land
 Where paradise awaits ( applause )
 And then boom !
 Fireworks over the Manhattan skyline !
 You kiss her .
 And that 's your superdate .
 That sounds gooey and romantic .
 Yeah .
 Strip club ? Strip club .

 So , tonight 's the big night .
 Where 's the D- bag taking you ?
 That 's not a good nickname for Don .
 I 'll think of a better one .
 You know , that , I just ... I canceled .
 What do you mean you ... Wait .
 Hey .
 Hey . What 's wrong ?
 Robin canceled her date .
 What ?
 She was totally psyched for it like an hour ago .
 Robin Scherbatsky .
 You look like the classiest , most expensive prostitute ever .
 Oh , thank you .
 I take it you 're excited to go out with Don ?
 You know what ?
 I kinda am .
 Don 't tell Marshall .
 I won 't .
 I bet you 'll have a nice time tonight .
 Yeah . Not , however , a super time .
 A super time will be had by Barney on his date with Anita .
 Yep .

 They 're calling it a superdate , so .
 Ted !
 How could you do that ? !
 Robin just got over her mourning period !
 She seemed so happy after the breakup .
 Oh , Ted .
 So unobservant . Such a guy .
 She was obviously crushed .
 Wait , but that would mean ...
 Oh , no .

 I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang Hey , whatcha singing ?
 Oh , just a little ditty I wrote about how many girls Barney 's been banging lately .
 Well , count me in for a verse .
 Great .
 Bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang Bang , bang , bang
 Bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang ...
 No !
 Oh , God .
 Where is she ?
 I think she 's in the restroom .
 ( crying ) ( all aahing ) No , guys , guys , I 'm fine , I 'm fine .
 ( knocking on door ) ( whistling )
 Hey .
 Dude .
 Why would you do that ?
 Because I 'm angry at you .
 I 'm angry at me .
 I 'm angry at Ted .
 And frankly , I 'm still angry at the Empire .
 Why are you angry at me ?
 Dude , you 've been a real jerk in front of Robin while she 's been going through her mourning period .
 Mourning period ?
 She hasn 't been going through any mourning period .
 ( sighs ) So unobservant .
 Such a guy .
 Ugh , Barney , sit down , you need to hear some stuff .
 What- what , is she upset or something ?
 Of course she 's upset .
 Take a look at yourself , you dumb slut .

 You should 've seen this girl .
 Bang , ping , pa- dow , ga- donk .
 Okay , I 'm leaving .
 So ... we get up to my place ...
 ( crying ) ( people cheering on TV )
 ( sniffling )
 Bang , bangity bang , bang , bang , bang Bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang
 Bang , bang , bang ...
 ( vomiting )
 I can 't believe Robin 's been so upset .
 I can 't believe you threw up in your Stormtrooper helmet .
 Eh .
 I did something worse in it
 So , she 's been this way ever since we broke up ?
 Actually , she was doing much better until you decided to go on this stupid superdate with Anita .
 And now she 's off sulking God knows where .
 I know where .
 ( sighs )
 Hey .
 Hey . Barney , what 's up ?
 ( sniffling )
 Thought you were , um , going on some big date .
 Robin , I know you 're upset .
 What ?
 No .
 I - I- I have ... I 've never been happier .
 And- and this Anita sounds lovely .
 I am so glad that you two just ... randomly happened to find each other .
 It just warms my frickin ' heart .
 ( heavy breathing )
 Ah .
 ( gun clicks ) ( grunts ) ( sighs )
 So , you sure you 're not upset ?
 Of course I 'm upset , Barney .
 Don 't you see how constantly talking about your conquests makes me feel like I 'm just another number to you ?
 But you 're not just another number to me .
 You know , and- and now you 're taking Anita , who you barely know , on this amazing date , when I never got treated that way .
 It just ... it just sucks , that 's all . It just sucks .
 ( sighs )
 Wow .
 I knew I was bad at being a boyfriend , but I had no idea I 'd be so much worse at being an ex- boyfriend .
 I 'm sorry .
 What can I do to make it up to you ?
 Nothing , Barney .
 You 've- you 've already proven that I 'm not important to you .
 Stop that , I 'm serious .
 Ask me for anything .
 Uh , okay .
 Um ... don 't sleep with Anita .
 Done .
 Barney , of course you 're going to sleep with her .
 Why else would you be taking her on this superdate ?
 She 's not going on the superdate , Robin .
 You are .



 ANlTA :
 Barney .
 Oh , hey , Anita .
 I - I totally meant to call you .
 Well , I 'm- I 'm breaking all my rules coming down here , but nobody stands me up like that .
 So , are we going out or what ?
 I 'm sorry . I ...
 I made a promise to a friend .
 I have to say no .
 Oh .
 Oh , I see .
 You 're trying the " no " thing on me .
 You really think that 's going to work ?
 ' Cause it won 't .
 Okay , how about this . I 'll cut you a deal .
 Maybe ... you might get lucky after the 12th date .
 No .
 The 11th date . No .
 Fifth date . No .
 Tonight . No .
 Tonight before dinner . ( strained ) : No .
 How about you ? You interested . Yeah .
 Come on , Barney .
 I 'm sorry , Anita .
 The answer is no .
 Well , good .
 Because my answer is no , too .
 Okay , here 's my final offer .
 Barney !
 And that 's my story .
 Well , here 's a $500 ticket for jumping in the river .
 I hope it was worth it .
 ( fireworks popping )
 I hope so , too .
 It 's an old wives ' tale .
 Oh , hey , Robin .
 Hey . How did the big date go ?
 Uh , pretty well .
 Pretty , uh , pretty well .
 Like how " pretty well " ?
 Oh , guys , guys , come on .
 It was fine .
 You know , it was nice .
 We had a good time .
 Let 's just , uh ...
 let 's just leave it at that , okay .
 Although , um , one interesting thing , uh , did happen .
 I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang A- bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bangity bang
 I said a- bang , bang , bangity bang Bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang Bang , bang , bangity bang ...
