 Humphrey , what are you havering about ?
 I 'm simply saying we can 't take the Minister 's approval for granted .
 The Italian government have offered a massive contract to manufacture propanol at our Merseyside plant , which means saving a plant we were going to have to close , saving jobs , earning export royalties .

 - He has to give us the go- ahead .
 - But if the Minister thinks ...
 Ministers don 't think !
 Don 't talk to me about Ministers .
 I 've been chairman of British Chemical Corporation for ten years , and in that time dealt with nineteen different Ministers .
 They 've usually not had time to see me , because they 're too busy bribing Trade Union leaders not to strike .
 - They 've never bribed anybody .
 - Oh , no ?
 " Have a quango , Tom ; a knighthood , Dick ; a peerage , Harry . "
 - But the Minister 's worried ...
 - Of course he 's worried !
 If I 'd never done anything to worry those vote- grabbing baby- kissing jellies , we 'd have gone down the tube years ago !
 - But propanol contains metadioxin .
 - So what ?
 Dioxin was released at Seveso .
 It can damage the foetus .
 That 's dioxin , for Christ 's sake !
 Metadioxin is an inert compound .
 It 's been given a clean bill of health by Washington .
 The Henderson Committee , which you set up , will give it the OK , too .
 I know , Wally , but the name could be politically sensitive .
 But I 've taken metadioxin out of the proposal .
 - I call it propanol .
 - Very wise of you .
 - You told me to .
 - Very wise of me !
 But the Minister may raise no objections , it just needs tact .
 Fine .
 In that case , there 's no problem .
 I 'll have a tactful word with Hacker and persuade the blancmange myself .
 Don 't take this amiss , Wally , but I might just be able to manage without your unique ... brand of tact .
 - This is wonderful news , Humphrey .
 - Yes , Minister .
 We turn a run- down plant from loss- maker into a profitable unit , the largest manufacturer of propanol in Europe .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Equipment made in UK factories .
 Income for the local authorities , foreign exchange from exports .
 - Too good to be true !
 - It is true .
 Good old propanol ...
 What is propanol , actually ?
 It used to be made with dioxin until the Seveso explosion , then they developed a safe compound , metadioxin .
 The Italian factory is sealed off so they 've asked the BCC to make it .
 - An ill wind .
 - Quite so .
 - But this stuff is perfectly safe ?
 - Perfectly .
 Weak Ministers might have doubts over the similarity of the names , but no one with any backbone would be deflected from such a beneficial project on such a useless pretext .

 I know just the sort of Minister you mean .
 Political jellyfish .
 Terrified of taking any decision .
 After all , every decision upsets someone , doesn 't it ?
 Good government is doing what 's right , not just what 's popular .
 - Absolutely , Minister .
 - But this will be popular ?
 - Very popular .
 - Humphrey , I want to be sure .
 You not asking me to make a courageous decision , are you ?
 Of course not , Minister .
 Good , good .
 Should I take it to Cabinet ?
 - I think the less said , the better .
 - Why ?
 Although metadioxin is totally harmless , the name may cause anxiety in ignorant minds .
 Humphrey , you 're talking about my Cabinet colleagues .
 I was referring to the Friends of the Earth .
 ( PHONE RlNGS )
 Yes ?
 Joan Littler has arrived , MP for Liverpool South West .
 Know what she wants ?
 She 's the Prime Minister 's PPS , and the new plant is in her constituency .
 - Show her in .
 If you 'll excuse us ?
 - The PM 's PPS ?
 I think I 'll stay .
 Joan Littler , member for Liverpool South West .
 - Do you know Humphrey Appleby ?
 - Delighted to meet you .
 Do take a seat .
 - Thank you , Bernard .
 - Bernard ...
 Now , what can I do for you ?
 Jim , what 's the British Chemical Corporation up to in my constituency ?
 They 'll be announcing a very exciting project , with new jobs .
 Yes ... but there 's some very worrying rumours .
 - Such as ?
 - Rumours of dangerous chemicals .
 All chemicals are dangerous ...
 The Minister means the rumours are unfounded , no cause for alarm .
 Can I have your assurance there 'll be a full public enquiry ?
 Not a bad idea ...
 The Minister was about to say there 's no need for an enquiry .
 - A report will be issued shortly .
 - I came here to talk to Jim .
 - You are talking to him .
 - But he 's not answering , you are !
 - The Minister and I are of one mind .
 - Whose ?
 Yours ?
 I 've heard this factory made the chemical that poisoned Seveso !
 - That 's not true .
 - Isn 't it ?
 The chemical in Seveso was dioxin .
 This is metadioxin .
 - That 's virtually the same thing .
 - Just a similar name .
 It 's the same name with " meta " stuck on the front .
 - That makes all the difference .
 - Why ?
 What does " meta " mean ?
 - What does " meta " mean , Humphrey ?
 - " With " , " after " or " beyond " .
 From the Greek , of course .
 " After " dioxin or " beyond " dioxin .
 If it 's in the accusative , it 's " beyond or after " , with the genitive it 's " with " , as in Latin , as you no doubt recall .
 The ablative is used for words needing " with " to precede them .
 But of course , there isn 't an ablative in Greek .
 - Well done , Bernard .
 - Thank you .
 - You see ?
 - Not exactly , no .
 - I thought that was perfectly plain .
 - What I insist on knowing is what is the actual difference between dioxin and metadioxin .
 Metadioxin is an inert compound of dioxin .
 I think I follow that , Humphrey , but could you explain it a little more clearly ?
 - In what sense , Minister ?
 - What does " inert " mean ?
 It means it 's not ... ... ert .
 Wouldn 't " ert " a fly .
 - What did you say , Bernard ?
 - Nothing , Minister .
 - What does that mean in practical terms ?
 - You mean chemically ?
 - Yes , chemically .
 - What does it mean chemically ?
 I can 't explain it in layman 's language ...
 - Do you know any chemistry ?
 - Of course not , Minister .
 I was in the scholarship form .
 Classics .
 - And what 's a compound ?
 - Don 't you know any chemistry ?
 No .
 Do you ?
 - We ought to , oughtn 't we ?
 - A compound is a ...
 You know what compound interest is ?
 Yes , well , a jolly good thing .
 That 's the sort of thing a compound is .
 That 's it , then .
 To sum up , I think we 're all of the same mind , broadly speaking .
 We 're ready to go ahead .
 I 've said no such thing !
 The only difference is in the name , dioxin and metadioxin , like ...
 Littler and Hitler .
 Not that you 're like Hitler because your name 's similar !
 - That 's not the point .
 - What is the point ?
 The point is this factory is in my constituency !
 It 'll be good for the constituency , more jobs , more money .
 The only people we 'll offend are a few environmentalists .
 At most , it won 't cost us more than 100 votes .
 My majority is 91 .
 Not to mention the three marginal constituencies bordering mine !
 Could I intervene just once more ?
 The case for the BCC manufacturing propanol is overwhelming .
 Overwhelming .
 Great jobs , increased income and secure , profitable export orders .
 - Export orders .
 - Furthermore ... the drug has been declared safe by Washington ,
 - Washington .
 - We 're preparing a report , too .
 The Minister is confident that this scheme is to the advantage of your constituency and the country .
 If it proves not to be safe , I won 't allow its manufacture here .
 But if the report says it is safe , that 'd be absurd , wouldn 't it ?
 I 'm not satisfied with that , Jim .
 Remember that the party made you an MP , and you can 't be a Minister if your party loses the next election .
 You still don 't look happy , Minister .
 Suppose the report isn 't as conclusive as you say .
 - Oughtn 't I to meet this Henderson ?
 - No need .
 He 's a brilliant Cambridge biochemist , chosen with some care .
 Suppose he produces a cautious , wait- and- see report ?
 We don 't publish it .
 We use the American report instead .
 Fine !
 - You mean we suppress it ?
 - No , we just don 't publish it .
 - What 's the difference ?
 - All the difference in the world !
 Suppression is the instrument of dictatorships .
 We don 't talk of that sort of thing in a free country .
 We take a democratic decision not to publish .
 Fine .
 What am I to say to the press and parliament ?
 " We hoped the report would say it was a wise decision . "
 " But we 've cocked it up so we 'll pretend the report doesn 't exist . "
 - Very droll .
 - What would I say ?
 There 's a Government procedure for suppress ... ... deciding not to publish reports .
 - Really ?
 You simply discredit them .
 Good heavens !
 How ?
 Stage One , give your reasons in terms of the public interest .
 - Hint at security considerations ...
 - Mind if I make a note ?
 This could be useful for discrediting some of the party 's idiotic research documents .
 The report could put pressure on Government and be misinterpreted .
 Anything could be misinterpreted .
 The Sermon on the Mount could be !
 Indeed , it could be argued the Sermon should not have been published .
 A most irresponsible document .
 All that stuff about the meek inheriting the earth could do irreparable damage to the defence budget .
 I suppose you 're right .
 What else ?
 Say it 's better to wait for a more detailed study over longer time .
 - Suppose there isn 't one ?
 - Commission one .
 Gives you even more time to play with .
 - All this is Stage One ? - Yes .

 In Stage Two ... discredit the evidence you 're not publishing .
 - How , if you 're not publishing it ?
 - It 's easier if it 's not published .
 Do it by press leaks , of course , not directly .
 Say it leaves important questions unanswered , the evidence is inconclusive , the figures are open to other interpretations , that certain findings are contradictory , and that some of the main conclusions have been questioned .


 - Suppose they haven 't ?
 - Then question them !
 Then they have !
 But you 'd have to go through it with a fine- toothed comb .
 No , no , no .
 You 'd say all these things without reading it .
 There 's always some questions unanswered .
 - Such as ?
 - The ones that weren 't asked .
 - That 's Stage Two ? In Stage Three ... you undermine recommendations . - Yes .



 " Not a basis for long- term decisions . "
 " Not sufficient information on which to base a valid assessment . "
 " Not really any need for a fundamental rethink of policies . "
 " Broadly speaking , endorses current practice . " It 's easy .
 - That works ?
 - Nearly always .
 - Suppose it doesn 't ?
 - Move on to Stage Four .
 - Stage Four ?
 - Discredit the man who produced the report .
 Off the record .
 Say that he 's harbouring a grudge against the Government or , better still , that he used to be a consultant to a multi- national company .
 - Supposing he wasn 't ?
 - Then he 's hoping to be .
 Everybody 's hoping to be a consultant to a multi- national .
 Or he 's trying for a knighthood or vice- chancellorship .
 There are endless possibilities .
 Excuse me .
 The press officer rang to say there 's an item on the news .
 Yes , yes .
 Why wasn 't I told ?
 The BCC aren 't obliged to clear it with us .












 - This metadioxin is dynamite .
 - It 's totally harmless .
 Only chemically , not politically .
 - It can 't hurt anyone .
 - It could finish me off !
 Yes ?
 Minister , Number 10 on the phone .
 The political office - the PM 's just seen the news .
 Hello , Jim here !
 Yes , I just saw that , too .
 We don 't need to be too worried about a little local difficulty .
 Not in view of the jobs and exports ...
 No , not many jobs .
 Ninety , I think .
 Yes , but ...
 You do , do you ?
 Yes , well ...
 I was coming round to that viewpoint myself .
 Humphrey ...
 - Something just struck me .
 - I noticed .
 There are arguments against this scheme .
 - Minister , you 've already agreed ...
 - It could lead to a loss of ... ... public confidence .
 - You mean votes ?
 Votes ? No , no .
 It 's not the votes that are a consideration at all .
 But you see , it 's the public will .
 This is a democracy ...
 - and the people don 't like it .
 - The people are ignorant and misguided .
 It was the people who elected me !
 In a week , the whole thing will have blown over , and in a year 's time , we 'll have a safe and successful factory .
 A week 's a long time in politics .
 A year 's a short time in Government .
 You 're in Government , I 'm in politics and the PM is not pleased .
 - With the greatest respect ...
 - Going to insult me again ?
 You 're putting party before country .
 Can 't you think of a new cliché ?
 Minister , a new cliché could be said to be a contradiction in terms .
 Humphrey , you lead a sheltered life .
 I intend to survive and I 'm not crossing the PM .
 Why must you be so concerned with climbing the greasy pole ?
 The greasy pole is important .
 I have to climb it .
 Why ?
 ' Cause it 's there !
 The editor of the Times , please .
 Thank you , Bernard .
 How come the Times knows about the report before I do ?
 - There 's been a leak .
 - I know that !
 It was " Confidential " .
 I only got a draft last night .
 - At least it wasn 't " Restricted " .
 - Why ?
 " Restricted " means it was in the papers yesterday .
 " Confidential " means it won 't be in the papers till today .
 Who leaked this ?
 Humphrey ?
 - I 'm sure he didn 't , Minister .
 - Are you ?
 - He probably didn 't .
 - No ?
 - It might have been someone else .
 - These leaks are a disgrace !
 - People think it 's the politicians .
 - It has been known .
 In my opinion , we 're far more leaked against than leaking .
 " Political cowardice to reject the BCC proposal ... craven expediency . "
 " Hacker has no choice . "
 Humphrey thinks he 's got me committed !
 It 's an unofficial leak of a draft report .
 You 're committed to nothing .
 Does the report give you a way out ?
 Sir Wally McFarlane is waiting to see you .
 All right .
 But he 's wasting his time .
 - Come in , please , Sir Wally .
 - Thank you .
 Morning .
 - Morning .
 - May I join you , Minister ?
 - If you like .
 Do sit down .
 - Thank you , Jim .
 - Now ...
 - Thank you , Bernard .
 Sorry about that .
 I see from the press the Henderson Report comes clearly on our side .
 - I 've seen that , too .
 - That committee leaks like a sieve .
 So there 's no real case for refusing permission for the new plant .
 - I 'm not sure yet .
 - Now look , Jim ...
 We 've been working on this for two years , it 's very important .
 I 'm the chairman , and I tell you as a chemist , metadioxin is safe .
 You experts always think you 're right .
 The more inexpert you are , the more likely you are to be right ?
 Ministers are not experts .
 They 're chosen because they know nothing .
 You admit that ?
 Nothing about technical details .
 Ministers must take a broader view , that 's why I cannot commit yet .
 Look , Hacker !
 This is the wrong decision and you know it .
 It 's cowardly and craven !
 - I am not cowardly ...
 - Sit down !
 You 'll lose a few votes from a few people in those constituencies ?
 - It 's pathetic !
 - It 's politics !
 Exactly !
 I 'll be writing to the Secretary of State for Industry .
 I am prepared to resign if you block this one !
 How do you feel that went , Minister ?
 - We 'll have to get another chairman .
 - Get another ? !
 Nobody would accept a job like that !
 Nobody wants to be chairman of a nationalised industry !
 Instant ruin !
 They may as well accept the golden handshake the day they start .
 - We 'll find someone .
 - Some useless American geriatric .
 Not necessarily .
 How do you expect to find a decent replacement , when we forced his predecessor to resign for taking a sound decision , which we blocked for political reasons ?
 - I have no choice .
 - A Minister can do what he likes .
 It 's the people 's will .
 I am their leader .
 I must follow them .
 My hands are clean .
 I thought it was rather difficult to keep one 's hands clean while climbing the greasy pole .
 We must stop Wally making a fuss .
 Press conferences accusing me of lack of faith .
 - Interviews on Panorama .
 - What am I to do ?
 If I stop the scheme , the Times will accuse me of political cowardice .
 If I let it go ahead , the Mirror will say I 'm murdering unborn babies .
 If only the report had any doubt about the safety of metadioxin .
 - Are you sure it doesn 't , Minister ?
 - Not as it stands .
 - Henderson 's a Cambridge man ?
 - Yes .
 - Which college ?
 - King 's .
 Why ?
 Nothing .
 Just wondered if it was my old college .
 Weren 't you at the LSE ?
 Yes , so I was .
 - Have you got his file ?
 - It 's with the report .
 - Got a Cambridge telephone ... ?
 - You do realise - not that you have any such intention - but it would be most improper to influence an independent report of this nature ?

 Most improper !
 Out of the question .
 Just it might be nice to pop down to have tea with my old friend ,
 R. A. Crichton , Provost of King 's .
 Get him on the phone .
 Yes , Minister .
 Get me King 's College , Cambridge .
 Who knows ?
 Professor Henderson might drop in for tea .
 That 'd be a happy coincidence , wouldn 't it ?
 - Perfectly natural .
 - Nothing improper about that .
 - How can a coincidence be improper ?
 - My feeling entirely .
 ( PHONE RlNGS )
 Yes ?
 Lord Crichton , please .
 How 's the move from the Commons to the Lords ?
 Like moving from animals to vegetables .
 - Professor Henderson 's here .
 - Good to see you .
 Come and meet an old friend , Jim Hacker .
 - Jim , this is Professor Henderson .
 - Professor Henderson !
 I didn 't expect to see the Minister .
 - What a coincidence !
 - Yes , what a coincidence !
 - You know each other ?
 - We haven 't met .
 - I 'm writing a report for him .
 - Well , what a coincidence .
 - Yes , what a coincidence !
 - Extraordinary coincidence .
 - You 're happy with my report ? - Absolutely .
 Delighted .
 - You must 've worked very hard .
 - Most of it was done by Washington .
 Excuse me , I 'll go and help with the tea .
 Tell me , have you ever written a Government report before ?
 - No .
 - Your name will be on it forever .
 " Henderson Report " .
 - It 's a kind of immortality .
 - I hadn 't thought of it like that .
 - But if it were to go wrong ...
 - Go wrong ?
 If this metadioxin isn 't as safe as you say ... your career ...
 Very courageous !
 None of the standard tests show any evidence of teratogenic toxicity .
 - Standard tests ?
 Quite .
 - What do you mean ?
 Well , I was making a few notes on the train coming down .
 I 'm not a biochemist , but it would appear that the US report leaves some important questions unanswered .
 Some of the evidence is inconclusive , some findings have been questioned , the figures are open to interpretation , and different results might come from a more detailed study .
 - Obviously , but ...
 - But if anything did go wrong , a delayed effect , the press would go straight to your report .
 And if it turned out that you 'd ever done ... ... laboratory trials for a multi- national drug company ...
 - That was 15 years ago .
 - 14 .
 You know what the press is like .
 No smoke without a fire .
 It could be a millstone !
 The popular press would be merciless , if anything went wrong :
 " Death Agony of Henderson Report Victims . "
 Yes ...
 Yes ... !
 I don 't know what to do !
 I can 't alter the evidence , the report says it 's a safe drug .
 - Quite .
 I see you have no choice .
 - Stop talking shop .
 Our Professor of Economics is dying to talk to you .
 You 're not worried about this report ?
 I 've done lots of these things .
 It 's the phrasing of the conclusion , that 's all the press ever read .
 Now ... how does it end ?
 " On existing evidence , the committee can see no reason not to proceed . "
 Well , it 's just a question of a tidy bit of re- drafting .
 " While the committee feel there 's no reason not to proceed on existing evidence ,
 " it must be emphasised that metadioxin is a recent compound ,
 " and it would be irresponsible to deny , after further research ,
 " its manufacture might be proved to be associated with health risks . "
 Yes , that seems perfectly fair .
 Could you just say that again ?
 Better than that ...
 I 'll jot it down for you .


 ( CROWDS CHEERlNG )



 Well , Minister ?
 Well , Humphrey ?
 - Do you feel like a hero ?
 - Indeed I do .
 - And Number 10 will be delighted .
 - One of the worst decisions ever !
 And one of the best political decisions I 've made .
 What do you think , Bernard ?
 Well ... bearing everything in mind and after due consideration ... considering all the implications and points of view ... well , in other words , in fact , I am bound to say ... you look awfully good on television , Minister .



 Humphrey , can we manage a CBE for Henderson ?
 Certainly not !
 He 's unreliable and lacking in judgement .
 I can 't think why he cast doubt on his whole report in that final paragraph .
 I think he has excellent judgement , enormous stature and great charm .
 I thought you said you 'd never met him .
 I meant intellectual stature , Humphrey .
 And charm ?
 He writes with charm .
 Doesn 't he , Bernard ?
 Oh , yes , Minister . http : // episode- heaven . rt . hu
