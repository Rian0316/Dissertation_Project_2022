 All right , let him go .
 Hello .
 Are you all right ?
 What is it , dear ? Are you lost ?



 Well , that was tedious . You went on the tube like that ?
 None of the cabs would take me .
 Nothing ?
 Military coup in Uganda .
 Another photo of you with the ...
 Well , um , Cabinet reshuffle ?
 Nothing of importance ?
 God !
 John , I need some . Get me some .
 No . Get me some .
 No . Cold turkey we agreed , no matter what .
 Anyway , you 've paid everyone off , remember ?
 No- one within a two- mile radius will sell you any .
 Stupid idea . Whose idea was that ?
 Mrs Hudson !
 Look , Sherlock , you 're doing really well , don 't give up now !
 Tell me where they are !
 Please , tell me .
 Please .
 Can 't help , sorry . I 'll let you know next week 's lottery numbers .
 It was worth a try .
 My secret supply , what have you done with my secret supply ?
 Cigarettes , what have you done with them ?
 You never let me touch your things ! Chance would be a fine thing .
 I thought you weren 't my housekeeper .
 I 'm not .
 How about a nice cuppa and perhaps you could put away your harpoon ?
 I need something stronger than tea . Seven percent stronger .
 You 've been to see Mr Chatterjee again . Pardon ?
 Sandwich shop . That 's a new dress , but there 's flour on the sleeve .
 You wouldn 't dress like that for baking .
 Sherlock ... Thumbnail . Tiny traces of foil .
 Been at the scratch cards again . We all know where that leads .
 Kasbah Nights . Racy for a Monday morning , wouldn 't you agree ?
 I wrote a blog on the identification of perfumes . You should look it up !
 Please !
 Don 't pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr Chatterjee , he 's got a wife nobody knows about .
 Sherlock !
 Well , nobody except me . I don 't know what you 're talking about , I really don 't !
 What the bloody hell was all that about ? You don 't understand .
 Go after her and apologise .
 Apologise ?
 John , I envy you so much .
 You envy me ?
 Your mind , it 's so placid , straight- forward , barely used .
 Mine 's like an engine , racing out of control .
 A rocket , tearing itself to pieces , trapped on the launch pad . I need a case !
 You 've just solved one , by harpooning a dead pig , apparently !
 That was this morning .
 When 's the next one ? Nothing on the website ?
 " Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes . I can 't find Bluebell anywhere .
 " Please , please , please can you help ? "
 Bluebell ? A rabbit , John !
 But there 's more .
 Before Bluebell disappeared , it turned luminous .
 " Like a fairy , " according to little Kirsty . Then the next morning , Bluebell was gone .
 Hutch still locked , no sign of a forced entry .
 What am I saying , this is brilliant ! Phone Lestrade .
 Tell him there 's an escaped rabbit .
 Are you serious ? It 's this or Cluedo .
 No . We are never playing that again .
 Why not ? It 's not possible for the victim to have done it .
 It was the only possible solution . It 's not in the rules .
 Well , then , the rules are wrong !
 A single ring .
 Maximum pressure , just under the half second .
 Client !
 Dartmoor , it 's always been a place of myth and legend , but is there something else lurking out here ?
 Something very real .
 Dartmoor is also home to one the government 's most secret of operations , the chemical and biological weapons research centre , which is said to be even more sensitive than Porton Down .

 Since the end of the Second World War , there have been persistent stories about the Baskerville experiments .
 Genetic mutations , animals grown for the battlefield .
 There are many who believe that within this compound , in the heart of this ancient wildness , there are horrors beyond imagining .
 But the real question is , are all of them still inside ? '
 I was just a kid .
 It was on the moor .
 It was dark , but I know what I saw .
 I know what killed my father .
 What did you see ?
 I was just about to say .
 Yes , in a TV interview . I prefer to do my own editing .
 Yes . Sorry , yes , of course .
 Excuse me .
 In your own time .
 But quite quickly .
 Do you know Dartmoor , Mr Holmes ? No .
 It 's an amazing place , it 's like nowhere else , it 's sort of bleak , but beautiful .
 Not interested . Moving on .
 We used to go for walks , after my mum died , my dad and me .
 Every evening , we 'd go out onto the moor .
 Good . Skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed , where did that happen ?
 There 's a place , it 's a sort of local landmark , called Dewer 's Hollow .
 That 's an ancient name for the devil .
 So ?
 Did you see the devil that night ?
 Yes .
 It was huge .
 Coal- black fur with red eyes .
 It got him .
 Tore at him , tore him apart .
 I can 't remember anything else .
 They found me the next morning , just wandering on the moor .
 My dad 's body was never found .
 Red eyes , coal- black fur , enormous ...
 A dog ? Wolf ?
 Or a genetic experiment .
 Are you laughing at me , Mr Holmes ?
 Why , are you joking ?
 My dad was always going on about the things they were doing at Baskerville .
 About the type of monsters they were breeding there .
 People used to laugh at him .
 At least the TV people took me seriously .
 And I assume did wonders for Devon tourism . Yeah ...
 Henry , whatever did happen to your father , it was 20 years ago .
 Why come to us now ?
 Not sure you can help me , Mr Holmes , since you find it all so funny !
 Because of what happened last night . Why , what happened last night ?
 How ... How do you know ?
 I didn 't know , I noticed .
 You came up from Devon on the first train this morning .
 You had a disappointing breakfast and a black coffee . The girl across the aisle fancied you .
 Though initially keen , you 've changed your mind .
 You are anxious to have your first cigarette of the day .
 Sit down , Mr Knight , and do please smoke . I 'd be delighted .
 How on Earth did you notice all that ? It 's not important ...
 Punched out holes where your ticket 's been checked . Not now .
 I 've been cooped- up for ages ! You 're showing off .
 I am a show- off , that 's what we do .
 Train napkin you used to mop up the spilled coffee .
 Strength of the stain shows that you didn 't take milk .
 There are traces of ketchup on it and on your lips and sleeve .
 Cooked breakfast , or the nearest thing those trains manage . Sandwich .
 How did you know it was disappointing ?
 Is there any other type of breakfast on a train ? The girl .
 Female handwriting 's distinctive , wrote her number on the napkin .
 I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you .
 After she got off , I imagine you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee , accidentally smudging the numbers .
 You 've been over the last four digits in another pen , so you wanted to keep the number .
 You used the napkin to blow your nose , so you 're not that into her .
 Then there 's the nicotine stains on your shaking fingers . I know the signs .
 No chance to smoke when on the train , no time to roll one before you got a cab here .
 It 's just after 9 . 15 , you 're desperate .
 The first train from Exeter to London leaves at 5 . 46am .
 You got the first one , so something important must have happened last night . Am I wrong ?
 No .
 You 're right .
 You 're completely , exactly right .
 Bloody hell , I heard you were quick . It 's my job . Now shut up and smoke .
 Em .
 Henry , your parents both died and you were what , seven years old ?
 I know , that ...
 That must be quite a trauma .
 Now , have you ever thought that maybe you invented this story , this ...
 to account for it ?
 That 's what Dr Mortimer says . Who ?
 His therapist . My therapist .
 Obviously .
 Louise Mortimer .
 She 's the reason I came back to Dartmoor .
 She thinks I have to face my demons .
 What happened when you went back to Dewer 's Hollow last night ?
 You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you 're consulting a detective .
 What did you see that changed everything ? It 's a strange place , the Hollow .
 It makes you feel so cold inside , so afraid .
 Yes , if I wanted poetry , I 'd read John 's emails to his girlfriends , much funnier . What did you see ?
 Footprints .
 On the exact spot where I saw my father torn apart .
 Man 's or a woman 's ? Neither . They were ...
 Is that it ? Nothing else ? Footprints , is that all ?
 Yes . But they were ...
 Dr Mortimer wins . It 's a childhood trauma masked by an invented memory .
 Boring . Goodbye , Mr Knight , thank you for smoking . What about the footprints ?
 They 're probably paw prints , could be anything , therefore nothing .
 Off to Devon with you and have a cream tea on me .
 Mr Holmes , they were the footprints of a gigantic hound .
 Say that again .
 I found footprints , they were big ...
 No , no , no , your exact words .
 Repeat your exact words from a moment ago , exactly as you said them .
 Mr Holmes , they were the footprints of a gigantic hound .
 I 'll take the case . Sorry , what ?
 Thank you for bringing this to my attention , it 's very promising . Sorry , what ?
 A minute ago , footprints were boring , now they 're very promising ?
 It 's got nothing to do with footprints , you weren 't listening . Baskerville , heard of it ?
 Vaguely . It 's very hush- hush .
 Sounds like a good place to start . You 'll come down ?
 I can 't leave London at the moment , far too busy .
 But don 't worry , I 'm putting my best man onto it .
 I can always rely on John to send me the relevant data , as he never understands a word of it .
 What are you talking about ? You don 't have a case ! You were complaining ...
 I 've got Bluebell !
 The case of the vanishing glow- in- the- dark rabbit .
 NATO 's in uproar . You 're not coming , then ?
 OK .
 OK .
 I don 't need those any more , I 'm going to Dartmoor .
 You go on ahead , Henry , we 'll follow later . Sorry , so you are coming ?
 20- year- old disappearance , a monstrous hound ?
 I wouldn 't miss this for the world !
 .. cruise together , you had no intention of taking me on a boat !
 Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster .
 Wait until she finds out about the one in Islamabad .
 Paddington Station , please .
 There 's Baskerville .
 That 's Grimpen Village .
 So that must be ...
 Yes , Dewer 's Hollow .
 What 's that ?
 A mine field ?
 Technically , Baskerville 's an army base , so I guess they 've always been keen to keep people out .
 Clearly .
 Right , three tours a day . Tell your friends , tell anyone .
 Don 't be strangers .
 And remember , stay away from the moor at night , if you value your lives !
 Take care .
 It 's cold .

 That part doesn 't change .
 What does ?
 There 's something else . It 's a word .
 Liberty .
 Liberty ?
 And there 's another word .
 In .
 I. N.
 Liberty In . What do you think it means ?
 Sorry we couldn 't do a double room for you boys .
 That 's fine . We 're not ...
 There you go .
 Ta . I 'll just get your change . Ta .

 There you go .
 I couldn 't help noticing , on the map of the moor , a skull and crossbones ?
 That .
 Pirates ? No . The Great Grimpen Minefield , they call it .
 Right .
 It 's not what you think . It 's the Baskerville testing site .
 It 's been going for 80- odd years .
 I 'm not sure anyone really knows what 's there any more .
 Explosives ? Not just explosives .
 Break into that place and if you 're lucky , you just get blown up , so they say .
 In case you 're planning a wee stroll . Ta . I 'll remember .
 Aye . No , it buggers up tourism a bit , so thank God for the demon hound .
 Did you see that show ? The documentary ? Quite recently , yeah .
 God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell .
 Ever seen it ? The hound ? Me ?
 No , no .
 Fletcher has .
 He runs the walks , the monster walks for the tourists , you know . He 's seen it .
 That 's handy for trade .
 I 'm just saying we 've been rushed off our feet , Billy . Yeah , lots of monster hunters .
 It don 't take much these days , one mention on Twitter and whoomph !
 We 're out of WKD .
 Right . What with the monster and the ruddy prison ,
 I don 't know how we sleep nights .
 Do you , Gary ? Like a baby .
 That 's not true . He 's a snorer . Hey , ssh .
 Is yours a snorer ? Got any crisps ?
 Yeah . No . All right ?
 Right , take care .
 Bye .
 Take care , bye .
 Mind if I join you ?
 It 's not true , is it , you haven 't actually seen this hound thing ?
 Are you from the papers ? No , nothing like that , just curious .
 Have you seen it ? Maybe .
 Got any proof ?
 Why would I tell you if I did ? Excuse me .
 I called Henry . Bet 's off John , sorry .
 What ? Bet ?
 My plan needs darkness . We 've got another half an hour of light . Wait , wait , what bet ?
 I bet John here 50 quid that you couldn 't prove you 'd seen the hound .
 Yeah , the guys in the pub said you could .
 Well , you 're going to lose your money , mate . Yeah ?
 Yeah . I seen it .
 Only about a month ago . Up at the Hollow . It was foggy , mind , couldn 't make much out .
 I see . No witnesses , I suppose . No , but ...
 Never are . No , wait .
 There .
 Is that it ? It 's not exactly proof , is it ? Sorry , John , I win .
 Wait , wait , that 's not all . People don 't like going up there , you know .
 To the Hollow .
 Gives them a bad sort of feeling .
 Is it haunted ? Is that supposed to convince me ?
 Nah , don 't be stupid ! Nothing like that .
 But I reckon there is something out there .
 Something from Baskerville , escaped .
 A clone ? A super- dog ? Maybe .
 God knows what they 've been spraying on us all these years , or putting in the water .
 I wouldn 't trust them as far as I could spit .
 Is that the best you 've got ?
 I had a mate once who worked for the MOD .
 One weekend we were meant to go fishing , but he never showed up .
 Well , not till late .
 When he did , he was white as a sheet .
 I can see him now .
 " I 've seen things today , Fletcher , " he said ,
 " that I never want to see again .
 " Terrible things . "
 He 'd been sent to some secret army place . Porton Down , maybe .
 Maybe Baskerville , or somewhere else .
 In the labs there , the really secret labs , he said he 'd seen terrible things .
 Rats as big as dogs , he said .
 And dogs , dogs the size of horses .
 We did say 50 .
 Ta .


 Pass , please .
 Thank you .
 You 've got ID for Baskerville ? !
 How ?
 It 's not specific to this place . It 's my brother 's .
 Access all areas . I , um , ahem , acquired it ages ago . Just in case .
 Brilliant .
 What 's the matter ? We 'll get caught . We won 't !
 Well , not yet . Caught in five minutes .
 " Hi , we thought we 'd have a wander around your top secret weapons base . "
 " Really ? Great . Come in , kettle 's boiled . " That 's if we don 't get shot .
 Clear . Thanks very much . Thank you .
 Straight through , sir . Mycroft 's name literally opens doors .
 I 've told you , he practically is the British Government .
 I reckon we 've got about 20 minutes before they realise something 's wrong .
 What is it ? Are we in trouble ? Are we in trouble , sir .
 Yes , sir . Sorry , sir . You were expecting us ?
 Your ID showed up straight away , Mr Holmes . Corporal Lyons , security .
 Is there something wrong , sir ?
 I hope not , Corporal , I hope not . We don 't get inspected here .
 Ever heard of a spot check ?
 Captain John Watson , Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers . Sir .
 Major Barrymore won 't be pleased , sir . He 'll want to see you both .
 I 'm afraid we won 't have time . We need the full tour .
 Right away . Carry on . That 's an order , Corporal .
 Yes , sir .
 Nice touch . Haven 't pulled rank in ages .
 Enjoy it ? Yeah .
 How many animals do you keep down here ? Lots , sir .
 Any ever escape ? They 'd have to know how to use that lift , sir .
 We 're not breeding them that clever . Unless they have help .
 And you are ? It 's all right , Dr Frankland ,
 I 'm just showing these gentlemen around . New faces , how nice .
 Careful you don 't get stuck here , though , I only came to fix a tap .
 How far down does that lift go ? Quite a way , sir .
 And what 's down there ?
 Well , we have to keep the bins somewhere , sir .
 This way please , gentlemen .
 So what exactly is it that you do here ?
 I thought you 'd know , sir , this being an inspection .
 Well , I 'm not an expert , am I ?
 Everything from stem cell research to trying to cure the common cold , sir .
 But mostly weaponry ? Of one sort or another , yes .
 Biological , chemical ? One war ends , another begins , sir .
 New enemies to fight . We have to be prepared .
 OK , Michael , let 's try Harlow 3 next time .
 Dr Stapleton ... Stapleton ?
 Yes ? Who 's this ?
 Priority ultra , ma 'am , orders from on high . An inspection . Really ?
 We are to be accorded every courtesy , Dr Stapleton . What 's your role at Baskerville ?
 Accorded every courtesy , isn 't that the idea ?
 I 'm not free to say . Official secrets .
 You most certainly are free , and I suggest you remain that way .
 I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies .
 I like to mix things up .
 Genes , mostly . Now and again , actual fingers .
 Stapleton ! I knew I knew your name .
 I doubt it .
 People say there 's no such thing as coincidence .
 Dull lives they must lead .
 Have you been talking to my daughter ? Why did Bluebell have to die , Dr Stapleton ?
 The rabbit ? Disappeared from inside a locked hutch , which was always suggestive . The rabbit ?
 Clearly an inside job . You reckon ?
 Why ? Because it glowed in the dark .
 I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . Who are you ?
 We 've seen enough for now . Thank you so much . That 's it ?
 That 's it . It 's this way , isn 't it ?
 Just a minute !
 Did we just break into a military base to investigate a rabbit ?





 Ha ! 23 minutes .
 Mycroft 's getting slow .
 Hello , again .
 Major ...
 This is bloody outrageous ! Why wasn 't I told ? !
 Major Barrymore , is it ? Yes , well , good .
 Very good , we 're very impressed . Aren 't we , Mr Holmes ?
 Hugely . The point of Baskerville was to eliminate bureaucratic nonsense ! Sorry , Major .

 Inspections !
 Can 't remain unmonitored for ever , goodness knows what you 'd get up to . Keep walking . Sir !
 ID unauthorised , sir . What ?
 I 've just had the call . Is that right ? Who are you ?
 Look , there 's obviously been some kind of mistake .
 Clearly not , Mycroft Holmes .
 Computer error . It 'll all have to go in the report . What the hell 's going on ?
 It 's all right , Major , I know who these gentlemen are .
 You do ?
 Yeah , I 'm getting a little slow on faces , but Mr Holmes here isn 't someone I expected to show up in this place .
 Well ... Good to see you again , Mycroft .
 I had the honour of meeting Mr Holmes at the WHO conference in ... Brussels , was it ?
 Vienna . Vienna , that 's it .
 This is Mr Mycroft Holmes , Major . There 's obviously been a mistake .
 On your head be it , Dr Frankland .
 I 'll show them out , Corporal . Very well , sir .
 Thank you .
 This is about Henry Knight , isn 't it ? I thought so .
 I knew he wanted help , but I didn 't realise he was going to contact Sherlock Holmes !
 Don 't worry , I know who you really are . I 'm never off your website .
 I thought you 'd be wearing the hat . That wasn 't my hat .
 I hardly recognise him without the hat . It wasn 't my hat .
 I love the blog , too , Dr Watson . Cheers .
 The pink thing . And that one about the aluminium crutch . Yes .
 You know Henry Knight ? Well , I knew his dad better .
 He had all sorts of mad theories about this place .
 Still , he was a good friend .
 Listen , I can 't really talk now .
 Here 's my cell number .
 If I can help with Henry , give me a call .
 I never did ask , Dr Frankland , what exactly is it that you do here ?
 Mr Holmes , I would love to tell you , but then , of course , I 'd have to kill you .
 That would be tremendously ambitious of you . Tell me about Dr Stapleton .
 I never speak ill of a colleague .
 But you 'd speak well of one , which you 're clearly omitting to do .
 I do seem to be , don 't I ?
 I 'll be in touch . Any time .
 So ? So ?
 What was all that about the rabbit ?
 Please , can we not do this , this time ?
 Do what ? You being all mysterious with your ... cheekbones , and turning your coat collar up so you look cool .
 I don 't do that .
 Yeah , you do .
 So , the email from Kirsty . The missing luminous rabbit .
 Kirsty Stapleton , whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation .
 She made her daughter 's rabbit glow in the dark ?
 Probably a fluorescent gene .
 Removed and spliced into the specimen . Simple enough , these days .
 So ?
 So we know that Dr Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals .
 The question is , has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit ?
 To be fair , that is quite a wide field .
 Hi . Hi .
 Come in , come in .
 This is ...
 Are you , um , rich ?
 Yeah . Right .
 There 's a couple of words , it 's what I keep seeing .
 Liberty .
 Liberty ? Liberty . And ...
 In .
 It 's just that .
 Have you finished ?
 Mean anything to you ? Liberty in death , isn 't that the expression ? The only true freedom .
 What now , then ?
 Sherlock 's ... got a plan ? Yes .
 Right . We take you back out onto the moor .
 OK ... And see if anything attacks you . What ?
 That should bring things to a head . At night ?
 You want me to go out there at night ? That 's your plan ? Brilliant !
 Got any better ideas ? That 's not a plan .
 If there is a monster out there , John , there 's only one thing to do . Find out where it lives .
 ( Sherlock . )
 ( U , M , Q , R , A. Umqra ? )
 ( Sherlock . )
 ( Sherlock . ) ( Sherlock ? )
 Met a friend of yours ? What ?
 Dr Frankland ?
 Right . Bob , yeah .
 He seems pretty concerned about you .
 He 's a worrier , bless him .
 He 's been very kind to me since I came back .
 He knew your father ? Yeah .
 But he works at Baskerville . Didn 't your dad have a problem with that ?
 Well , mates are mates , aren 't they ? I mean , look at you and John .
 What about us ?
 Well , I mean , he 's a pretty straightforward bloke and you ...
 Well , they agreed never to talk about work , Uncle Bob and my dad .
 Dewer 's Hollow .
 ( Sherlock . )
 My god , my god , my god ! My god ! My god !
 Did you see it ?
 Did you hear that ? We saw it . We saw it !
 No , I didn 't see anything .
 What ? What are you talking about ?
 I didn 't see anything .
 Look , he must have seen it .
 I saw it . He must have . He must have .
 I ... Why ? Why ?
 Why would he say that ?
 It was there , it was .
 Henry , Henry , I need you to sit down . Try and relax , please .
 I 'm OK , I feel OK . I 'm going to give you something to help you sleep . All right ?
 This is good news , John .
 It 's ... it 's ... it 's good .
 I 'm not crazy .
 There is a hound there , there is .
 And Sherlock , he saw it too . No matter what he says , he saw it .
 Well , he 's in a pretty bad way . He 's manic .
 Totally convinced there 's some mutant super- dog roaming the moors .
 And there isn 't , though , is there ?
 If people knew how to make a mutant super- dog , we 'd know .
 It 'd be for sale . I mean , that 's how it works .
 Listen , on the moor I saw someone signalling , Morse .
 I guess it 's Morse . It doesn 't seem to make much sense .
 U , M , Q , R , A , does that mean anything ?
 So , OK , what have we got ?
 We know there 's footprints , because Henry found them , and so did the tour guide bloke .
 We all heard something .
 Maybe we should just look for whoever 's got a big dog .
 Henry 's right . What ?
 I saw it , too .
 What ? I saw it too , John .
 Just ... just a minute , you saw what ?
 A hound . Out there in the Hollow .
 A gigantic hound .
 Look , Sherlock , we have to be rational about this .
 OK , now you , of all people , can 't just ...
 Let 's just stick to what we know , yes ? Stick to the facts .
 Once you 've ruled out the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be true .
 What does that mean ?
 Look at me , I 'm afraid , John .
 Afraid .
 Sherlock .
 I 've always been able to keep myself distant .
 Divorce myself from feelings .
 But look , you see , body 's betraying me .
 Interesting , yes , emotions .
 The grit on the lens , the fly in the ointment .
 Yeah , all right , Spock , just ... take it easy .
 You 've been pretty wired lately , you know you have .
 I think you 've just gone out there and got yourself a bit worked up .
 Worked up ?
 It was dark and scary .
 Me ? There 's nothing wrong with me .
 Sherlock ...
 Sherl ... There is nothing wrong with me ! Do you understand ! ?
 You want me to prove it , yes ?
 We 're looking for a dog , yes ? A great big dog , that 's your brilliant theory . Cherchez le chien !
 Where shall we start ? How about them ?
 The sentimental widow and her son , the unemployed fisherman .
 The answer 's yes . Yes ?
 She 's got a West Highland Terrier called Whisky , not what we 're looking for !
 For God 's sake ! Look at his jumper , hardly worn . Clearly he 's uncomfortable .
 Could be the material or the hideous pattern , suggests it 's a present .
 He wants into his mother 's good books . Why ? Probably money .
 He 's treating her to a meal , but his own portion is small .
 He wants to impress her , but he 's trying to economise on his own food . Maybe he 's not hungry .
 No , small plate , starter . He 's practically licked it clean . She 's nearly finished her pavlova .
 If she 'd treated him , he 'd have had as much as he wanted .
 He 's hungry and not well- off , you can tell by his cuffs and shoes .
 Only a mother would give him a Christmas present like that .
 It could be an aunt or older sister , but mother 's more likely .
 He was a fisherman , the scarring on his hands is distinctive , fish hooks .
 They 're old , suggesting long- term unemployment .
 Not much industry here , so he 's turned to his widowed mother for help . Widowed ?
 She 's got a man 's wedding ring on a chain around her neck , clearly her late husband 's and too big for her finger .
 She 's well- dressed , but her jewellery is cheap .
 She could afford better , but she 's kept it , sentimental .
 The dog ? There are tiny hairs on her leg but none above the knees , suggesting it 's a small dog , probably a terrier .
 It is a West Highland Terrier called Whisky .
 " How do you know that ? "
 She was on the same train as us and I heard her call its name . That 's listening .
 I use my senses , unlike some people , so you see , I am fine .
 In fact , I 've never been better , so just leave me alone !
 Yeah , OK .
 OK .
 Why would you listen to me ? I 'm just your friend . I don 't have friends .
 No .
 I wonder why .
 Mr Selden , you 've done it again !
 I keep catching it with my belt .
 God !

 So ?



 You 're a bad man .
 That 's so mean !
 More wine , doctor ? Are you trying to get me drunk , doctor ?
 The thought never occurred .
 Because a while ago I thought you were chatting me up . Where did I go wrong ?
 When you started asking about my patients . Well , I am one of Henry 's oldest friends .
 Yeah , and he 's one of my patients , so I can 't talk about him .
 Although he has told me about all his oldest friends .
 Which one are you ? A new one ?
 OK , what about his father ? He wasn 't one of your patients .
 Wasn 't he some sort of conspiracy nutter ... theorist ?
 You 're only a nutter if you 're wrong . And was he wrong ?
 I should think so . But he got fixated on Baskerville , didn 't he ?
 With what they were doing in there .
 Couldn 't Henry have gone the same way , started imagining a hound ?
 Why do you think I 'll talk about this ?
 Because I think you 're worried about him and because I 'm a doctor too .
 And because I have another friend who might be having the same problem .
 Dr Watson ! Hi . Hello .
 How 's the investigation going ? Hello .
 What , investigation ?
 Didn 't you know ? Don 't you read the blog ? Sherlock Holmes .
 It 's ... Sherlock who ?
 Private detective . This is his PA .
 PA ? Well , live- in PA . Perfect !
 Live- in .. ?
 This is Dr Mortimer , Henry 's therapist .
 Hello . Bob Frankland .
 Listen , tell Sherlock I 've been keeping an eye on Stapleton .
 Any time he wants a little chat . All right ?
 Why don 't you buy him a drink ? I think he likes you .
 Morning ! How are you feeling ?
 I ...
 I didn 't sleep very well . That 's a shame .
 Shall I make us some coffee ? Look , you 've got damp !
 Listen , last night ...
 Why did you say you hadn 't seen anything ?
 I mean , I only saw the hound for a minute , but ... Hound ?
 What ? Why do you call it a hound ? Why a hound ?
 Why ? What do you mean ? It 's odd , isn 't it ?
 It 's a strange choice of words , archaic .
 That 's why I took the case . " Mr Holmes , they were the footprints of a gigantic hound . "
 Why say " hound " ?
 I don 't know , I 've never ...
 Actually , I 'd better skip the coffee .
 Did you get anywhere with that Morse code ?
 Nah .
 U , M , Q , R , A , wasn 't it ? Umqra .
 Nothing . Qra ...
 Look , forget it . I thought I was onto something , I wasn 't .
 Sure ? Yeah .
 How about Louise Mortimer , did you get anywhere with her ? No .
 Too bad . But did you get any information ?
 You 're being funny now ?
 Thought it might break the ice , a bit .
 Funny doesn 't suit you . Let 's stick to ice .
 John ... It 's fine .
 Wait , something happened to me last night , something I 've not experienced before .
 Yes , you said . Fear , Sherlock Holmes got scared , you said . It was more than that , John .
 It was doubt .
 I felt doubt .
 I 've always been able to trust my senses , the evidence of my own eyes , until last night .
 You can 't actually believe that you saw some kind of monster ? No , I can 't believe that .
 But I did see it , so the question is , how ? How ?
 Yes .
 Yeah , right , good .
 So you 've got something to go on , then . Good luck with that .
 Listen , what I said before , John , I meant it .
 I don 't have friends .
 I 've just got one .
 Right .
 John .
 John ! You are amazing ! You are fantastic !
 Yes , all right , you don 't have to overdo it .
 You may not be the most luminous of people , but as a - conductor of light , you are unbeatable . - Cheers What ?
 Some people who aren 't geniuses have an ability to stimulate it in others .
 You were saying sorry . Don 't spoil it . So what have I done that 's so bloody stimulating ?

 Yeah ?
 What if it 's not a word , what if it is individual letters ?
 You think it 's an acronym ?
 Absolutely no idea , but ...
 - What the hell are you doing here ? ! - Nice to see you too
 I 'm on holiday , would you believe ? No , I wouldn 't .
 Hello , John . Greg .
 I heard you were in the area . What are you up to ?
 Are you after this Hound of Hell , like on the telly ?
 I 'm waiting for an explanation , Inspector , why are you here ? I 've told you , I 'm on holiday .
 You 're brown as a nut . You 're clearly just back from your holidays . I fancied another one .
 This is Mycroft , isn 't it ? Now , look ... Of course it is .
 One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to spy on me , incognito .
 Is that why you 're calling yourself " Greg " ? That 's his name .
 Is it ? Yes . If you 'd ever bothered to find out .
 Look , I 'm not your handler .
 And I just don 't do what your brother tells me .
 Actually , you could be just the man we want . Why ?
 Well , I 've not been idle , Sherlock .
 I think I might have found something . Here .
 I didn 't know if it was relevant .
 Starting to look like it might be . That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant .
 Excellent .
 A nice , scary inspector from Scotland Yard , who can put in a few calls , might come in very handy .
 Shop .
 What 's this ?
 Coffee . I made coffee . You never make coffee .
 Don 't you want it ? You don 't have to keep apologising .
 Thanks .
 I don 't take sugar .
 These records go back nearly two months .
 That 's nice . It 's good .
 Is that when you had the idea , after the TV show went out ?
 It 's me . It was me .
 I 'm sorry , Gary . I couldn 't help it .
 I had a bacon sandwich at Cal 's wedding and one thing led to another . Nice try .
 Look , we were just trying to give things a bit of a boost , you know ?
 Let a great big dog run wild up on the moor , it was heaven- sent .
 It was like us having our own Loch Ness monster .
 And where do you keep it ? There 's an old mine shaft . It 's not too far .
 He was all right there . Was ?
 We couldn 't control the bloody thing . It was vicious .
 And then , a month ago ,
 Billy took him to the vet and , you know ...
 He 's dead ?
 Put down .
 Yeah . No choice .
 So it 's over .
 It was just a joke , you know .
 Yeah , hilarious
 You 've nearly driven a man out of his mind .
 You know he 's actually pleased you 're here ? Secretly pleased .
 Is he ?
 That 's nice .
 I suppose he likes having all the same faces back together .
 Appeals to his ... his ...
 Asperger 's ?
 So , you believe them about having the dog destroyed ? No reason not to .
 Well , hopefully there 's no harm done .
 I 'm not quite sure what I 'd charge them with , anyway . I 'll have a word with the local force .
 Right , that 's that , then . Catch you later .
 I 'm enjoying this . It 's nice to get London out of your lungs .
 So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor ? Looks like it .
 But that wasn 't what you saw , that wasn 't just an ordinary dog .
 No . It was immense .
 It had burning red eyes , and it was glowing , John , its whole body was glowing .
 I 've got a theory , but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it .
 How ? Can 't pull off the ID trick again .
 Might not have to .
 Hello , brother , dear . How ARE you ?
 Afternoon , sir . Can you turn the engine off ?
 Thank you .
 I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside .
 Right . Which means you 'll have to start the search for the hound . OK .
 In the labs .
 Stapleton 's first .
 It could be dangerous .
 You know I 'd love to
 I 'd love to give you unlimited access to this place . Why not ?
 It 's a simple enough request , Major . I 've never heard of anything so bizarre .
 You 're to give me 24 hours , it 's what I negotiated , not a second more .
 I may have to comply with this order , but I don 't have to like it .
 I don 't know what the hell you expect to find here , anyway . Perhaps the truth .
 About what ? I see .
 The big coat should have told me .
 You 're one of the conspiracy lot , aren 't you ?
 Well , then , go ahead , seek them out , the monsters , the death rays , the aliens .
 Have you got any of those ?
 Just wondering .
 A couple . Crash landed here in the '60s .
 We call them Abbott and Costello .
 Good luck , Mr Holmes .
 God !
 God !
 Come on .
 Hello ?
 No , come on . Come on .
 ( No ... Don 't be ridiculous . ) ( Pick up . )
 Damn it .
 ( Right . )
 ( It 's here . It 's in here with me . )
 ' Where are you ? '
 ( Get me out , Sherlock , you 've got to get me out . ) ( The big lab , the first lab that we saw . )
 ' John ... John ? '
 ( Now , Sherlock ! Please ! )
 ' All right , I 'll find you . Keep talking . '
 ( I can 't , it 'll hear me . )
 ' Keep talking . What are you seeing ?
 ' John ? '
 ( Yes , I 'm here . )
 ' What can you see ? '
 ( I don 't know . I don 't know , but I can hear it now . )
 ( Did you hear that ? )
 ' Stay calm , stay calm . Can you see it ?
 ' Can you see it ? '
 ( No , I can 't . )
 I can see it .
 ( I can see it . )
 ( It 's here . )
 Are you all right ? John ?
 Jesus Christ ! It was the hound !
 Sherlock , it was here , I swear it , Sherlock , it must , it must ...
 Did- did you see it ? You must have !
 It 's all right , it 's OK now .
 NO , IT 'S NOT ! IT 'S NOT OK !
 I saw it , I was wrong !
 Well , let 's not jump to conclusions . What ?
 What did you see ? I told you , I saw the hound ? Huge , red eyes ?
 Yes .
 Glowing ? Yeah .
 No . What ?
 I made up the bit about glowing .
 You saw what you expected to see because I told you .
 You have been drugged . We have all been drugged . Drugged ?
 Can you walk ? Of course I can walk .
 Come on , then . It 's time to lay this ghost .
 Back again ? What 's on your mind this time ?
 Murder , Dr Stapleton .
 Refined , cold- blooded murder .
 Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell , or shall I ?
 OK . What do you want ?
 Can I borrow your microscope ?
 Are you sure you 're OK ? You look very peaky .
 No , I 'm all right .
 It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish , in case you 're interested . What ?
 In the rabbits . Right , yeah .
 Aequorea victoria , if you really want to know .
 Why ? Why not ?
 We don 't ask questions like that here . My daughter ended up with one of the lab specimens , so poor Bluebell had to go . It isn 't done .
 It was a mix- up , anyway .
 Your compassion is overwhelming !
 I know .
 I hate myself sometimes .
 So , come on , then , you can trust me , I 'm a doctor , what else have you got hidden away up here ?
 Listen , if you can imagine it , someone is probably doing it somewhere .
 Of course they are .
 Cloning ? Yes , of course . Dolly the Sheep , remember ?
 Human cloning ? Why not ?
 And what about animals ? Not sheep .
 Big animals .
 Size isn 't a problem . Not at all .
 The only limits are ethics and the law and both those things can be very flexible .
 But not here , not at Baskerville . It 's not there !
 Jesus ! Nothing there ! It doesn 't make any sense !
 What were you expecting to find ?
 A drug , of course . It has to be a drug .
 An hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind .
 There 's no trace of anything in the sugar . Sugar ? Sugar , yes .
 A simple process of elimination . I saw the hound , saw it as my imagination expected me to see it .
 A genetically engineered monster .
 I knew I couldn 't believe my eyes , so there were seven possible reasons , the most possible being narcotics .
 Henry Knight , he saw it too , but you didn 't , John . You didn 't see it .
 We have eaten and drunk the same things since we got to Grimpen , apart from one thing .
 You don 't take sugar in your coffee . I see , so ?
 I took it from Henry 's kitchen , his sugar .
 It 's perfectly all right .
 But maybe it 's not a drug . No , it has to be a drug .
 How did it get into our systems ? How ?
 There has to be something , something ...
 Something ...
 Something buried deep .
 Get out . What ?
 Get out , I need to go to my mind palace . Your what ?
 He 's not going to be doing much talking for a while , we may as well go .
 His what ? His " mind palace " .
 It 's a memory technique , a sort of mental map .
 You plot a map with a location , it doesn 't have to be a real place .
 You deposit memories there .
 Theoretically , you never forget anything . All you do is find your way back to it .
 So this imaginary location could be anything , a house or a street ? Yeah .
 But he said " palace " , he said it was a palace ? Yeah , well , he would , wouldn 't he ?
 # You ain 't nothing ... #
 Hound .

 My god !
 My god ! My god ! I am so ...
 I am so sorry .
 I am so sorry .
 John ? Yeah , I 'm on it .
 Project HOUND . I must have read about it , stored it away .
 An experiment in a ClA facility in Liberty , Indiana .
 H- O- U- N- D.

 That 's as far as my access goes , I 'm afraid .
 There must be an override , a password ?
 I imagine so , but that 'd be Major Barrymore 's .
 Password , password . Password .
 He sat here when he thought it up .
 Describe him to me ? You 've seen him .
 But describe him .
 He 's a bloody martinet , a throw- back , the sort they 'd have sent into Suez .
 Good , excellent , old- fashioned . Traditionalist . Not the sort to use his children 's name as a password .
 He loves his job , proud of it and this is work- related . So what 's at eye level ?
 Books .
 Jane 's Defence Weekly , bound copies . Hannibal .
 Wellington . Rommel . Churchill 's History of the
 English- Speaking Peoples , all four volumes .
 Churchill , he 's fond of Churchill .
 Copy of The Downing Street Years , one to five . Separate biographies of Thatcher .
 Mid- 1980s , at a guess . Father and son .
 Barrymore Senior , medals , Distinguished Service Order . That date , I 'd say Falklands veteran .
 Right , Thatcher 's a more likely bet than Churchill . That 's the password ?
 No ! With a man like Major Barrymore , only first name terms would do .


 Hound .



 Jesus .
 Project HOUND . A new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible .
 They wanted to use it as an anti- personnel weapon , to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus .
 But they shut it down and hid it away in 1986 .
 Because of what it did to the subjects they tested it on . And what they did to others .
 Prolonged exposure drove them insane . Made them almost uncontrollably aggressive .
 So , someone 's been doing it again ? Carrying on the experiments ?
 Attempting to refine it , perhaps . For the last 20 years . Who ?
 Those names mean anything to you ?
 No , not a thing .
 Five principal scientists .
 20 years ago .
 Maybe our friend 's somewhere in the back of the picture ?
 Someone old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986 ?
 Maybe somebody who says " cell phone " because of time spent in America ? You remember , John ? - mm .
 Here 's my , cell number .
 He gave us his number , in case we needed him .
 My god , Bob Frankland .
 But Bob doesn 't work on ... He 's a virologist . This is chemical warfare .
 That 's where he started , though .
 He 's never lost the certainty , the obsession that that drug really could work .
 Nice of him to give us his number . Let 's arrange a little meeting .
 Hello ?
 Who 's this ? You 've got to find Henry .
 It 's Louise Mortimer .
 Louise , what 's wrong ?
 Henry was , was remembering . Then ...
 He tried ...
 He 's got a gun , he went for the gun and tried to ... What ?
 He 's gone . But you 've got to stop him , I don 't know what he might do .
 Where , where are you ?
 His house . I 'm OK . I 'm OK .
 Right , stay there . We 'll get someone to you , OK ?
 Henry ? He 's attacked her . Gone ?
 There 's only one place he 'll go , back to where it started .
 Lestrade ? Get to the Hollow . Dewer 's Hollow , now !
 And bring a gun .
 I 'm sorry .
 I 'm so sorry , Dad .
 No , Henry , no , no ! Get back !
 Get away from me ! Easy , Henry , easy . Just relax .
 I know what I am , I know what I tried to do .
 Just put the gun down , it 's OK . No , no ! I know what I am !
 Yes , I 'm sure you do , Henry .
 It 's all been explained to you , hasn 't it ?
 Explained very carefully . What ?
 Someone needed to keep you quiet , needed to keep you as a child , to reassert the dream you both clung on to , because you had started to remember .
 Remember now , Henry , you 've got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy .
 I thought it had got my dad .
 The hound . I thought ... Jesus !
 I don 't ... I don 't know any more ! I don 't !
 No , Henry ! Henry , for God 's sake ! Henry , remember .
 " Liberty In . " Two words .
 Two words a frightened little boy saw here 20 years ago . You 'd started to piece things together .
 Remember what happened here that night .
 It wasn 't an animal , was it , Henry ?
 Not a monster .
 A man .
 You couldn 't cope . You were just a child .
 So you rationalised it into something very different .
 Then you started to remember , so you had to be stopped .
 Driven out of your mind so that no- one would believe a word that you said .
 Sherlock !
 It 's OK .
 It 's OK , mate .
 But we saw it , the hound , last night . We did , we s ...
 No , but there was a dog , Henry ,
 leaving footprints , scaring witnesses , but nothing more than an ordinary dog .
 We both saw it , saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it .
 Fear and stimulus , that 's how it works .
 But there never was any monster .
 Sherlock ?
 No ! No , no , no , no ! Henry , Henry ...
 Sherlock !
 No , no ! No , no , no , noooo !
 Henry .
 Sherlock , are you seeing this ?
 Right , he is not drugged , Sherlock , so what 's that ? No ! What is it ? !
 All right , it 's still here .
 But it 's just a dog , Henry . It 's nothing more than an ordinary dog .
 My god !
 Christ !
 No . No !
 It 's not you , not you ! ..
 Urgh ...
 The fog . What ? It 's the fog , the drug , it 's in the fog !
 Aerosol dispersant , that 's what it said in the records . Project HOUND , it 's the fog !
 A chemical minefield .
 For God 's sake , kill it ! Kill it !
 Look at it , Henry .
 No , no , no . Come on , look at it !
 You bastard .
 You ... bastard !
 20 years ! 20 years of my life , making no sense ! It 's all over now , come on .
 Why didn 't you just kill me ?
 Because dead men get listened to , he needed to do more than kill you .
 He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father .
 And he had the means right at his feet .
 A chemical minefield , pressure pads in the ground , dosing you up every time that you came back here .
 Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once .
 This case , Henry . Thank you .
 It 's been brilliant !
 Sherlock . What ? Timing .
 Not good ? No , no , it 's OK .
 It 's fine .
 Because this means ... this means that my dad was right .
 He 'd found something out , hadn 't he ?
 And that 's why you killed him , because he was right , and he 'd found you right in the middle of an experiment !
 Frankland !
 Frankland ! Keep running .
 Come on , keep up !
 It 's no use , Frankland .
 Thanks , Bill .
 So they didn 't have it put down then , the dog ? Obviously .
 I suppose they just couldn 't bring themselves to do it .
 I see .
 No , you don 't .
 No , I don 't . Sentiment ? Sentiment .
 Listen , what happened to me in the lab ?
 Do you want some sauce with that ?
 I hadn 't been to the Hollow . How come I heard those things there ? Fear and stimulus , you said ?
 You must have been dosed with it elsewhere . In the lab , maybe ?
 You saw those pipes , pretty ancient , leaky as a sieve .
 And they were carrying the gas , so ... Ketchup was it , or brown ? Hang on .
 You thought it was in the sugar . You were convinced it was in the sugar .
 I 'd better get going , there 's a train leaving in half an hour , so if you want ...
 God ! It was you .
 You locked me in that bloody lab .
 I had to , it was an experiment . An experiment ? ! Ssh .
 I was terrified , scared to death ! I thought the drug was in the sugar , so I put some in your coffee .
 Then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore .
 Totally scientific , laboratory conditions , literally .
 ( It 's in here with me . ) All right , keep talking , I 'll find you .
 Keep talking . ( I can 't , it 'll hear me . ) Tell me what you 're seeing .
 I don 't know , but I can hear it now .
 I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind , so I needed to try it on an average one .
 You know what I mean .
 But it wasn 't in the sugar . No , well ,
 I wasn 't to know you 'd already been exposed to the gas . So you got it wrong . No .
 You were wrong . It wasn 't in the sugar , you got it wrong .
 A bit .
 It won 't happen again .
 Any long- term effects ?
 None at all . You 'll be fine once you 've excreted it . We all will .
 I think I might have taken care of that already .
 Where are you going ? I won 't be a minute .
 Got to see a man about a dog .
