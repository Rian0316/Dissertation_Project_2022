 There 's nobody there , there 's nobody there !
 Help me , help me , help me , help me !
 There 's nobody there !
 There 's nobody there !
 There 's nobody there !
 Help me , help me , help me , help , help !
 Treachery , ruined , ruined , [ inaudible ]
 England !
 Holmes , Holmes ?
 Holmes ?
 Holmes , Holmes ?
 You come as a crisis , Watson !
 Help yourself to tobacco from the Persian slipper .
 I shall be at your service in an instant .
 If this remains blue , all is well .
 If it turns red , it 's a man 's life .
 I thought as much .
 Mrs. Hudson !

 Mrs. Hudson !
 Would you find Billy , please , and tell him to dispatch these telegrams without delay .
 Thank you .
 Oh , Sit down , Watson .
 A commonplace little murder !
 You have something more interesting , I fancy .
 You are the stormy petrel of crime , Watson .
 What is it ?
 I 've had a letter from a boy I was at school with .
 I think you should read it .
 Percy Phelps , brilliant boy , carried off every prize the school had to offer , went on to fresh triumphs at Cambridge .
 I must confess , he 'd passed completely out of my mind until this .
 " My Dear Watson :
 I have no doubt you remember Tadpole Phelps , who was in the third form when you were in the fifth .
 It 's possible you may have heard that through my uncle 's influence
 I obtained a good appointment at the Foreign Office . "
 His uncle 's Lord Holdhurst .
 " And that I was in a position of trust and honor till a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast my career . "
 Yes , his gaudy connections did him little good at school .
 It seemed to us a piquant thing to chevy him about the playground , hit him over the shins with a wicket .
 " Do you think you could bring your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me ? "
 That doesn 't tell us much .
 Hardly anything .
 But the writing is of interest , it is a woman 's .
 No , no , a man 's , surely .
 No , a woman 's .
 At the commencement of a case it is always something to know that a client is in close contact with someone who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature .
 You 're interested ?
 Indeed . Well , if you are ready ,
 let us start for Briarbrae House Woking , at once .
 Well , my practice --
 Oh , oh , oh , oh !
 Well , I mean , if your cases are more interesting than mine .
 I was gonna say , my practice would do very well for a day or two .
 It 's the slackest time of the year .
 Excellent .
 Then let us visit this diplomatist who is in such evil case , and the lady to whom he dictates his letters .
 Mrs. Hudson , hot water !
 Ah , Rose .
 Check this for me , would you ? That 's a good love .

 Mr. Sherlock Holmes ?
 And this is my colleague and friend , Dr. Watson .
 Dr. Watson , I 'm so glad you 've come .
 Percy 's been inquiring after you all morning , poor chap .
 I perceive that you , yourself , are not a member of the family ?
 Of course , you see my JH monogram .
 Now , for a moment I thought you 'd done something clever .
 Joseph Harrison is my name , and since Percy is betrothed to my sister Annie ,
 I shall at least be a relation by marriage .
 You 'll find her in his room , she 's been nursing him these past two months .
 Rose , in the house .
 Now , listen , they 're here .
 Shall I leave ?
 No , no .
 My dear Watson , I should never have known you under that mustache , and I daresay you wouldn 't be prepared to swear to me .
 Not at all , still the same dear old Tadpole .
 And this , I presume , is your celebrated friend ?
 Mr. Sherlock Holmes , Mr. Percy Phelps .

 And I 'm Miss Harrison .
 My fiancé , and my nurse .
 Please , sit down .
 I , uh , I showed Holmes the letter that you wrote to me .
 Yes , I hoped you would .
 It was rather short on detail .
 Then let me get straight to the point .
 I work as a clerk in the Foreign Office .
 My uncle is Lord Holdhurst .
 When he became Foreign Minister , he gave me , ocassional delicate missions of trust , which I always managed to conduct successfully .
 I 'm sure you did , old chap .
 Pray , continue , Mr. Phelps .
 Nearly ten weeks ago , it was the evening of the 23rd of May , he called me into his private room .

 Ah , Percy , my dear boy !
 Good evening , sir .
 You 've heard of the Naval Treaty that has just been drawn up between England and ltaly ?
 I 've read rumors in the press , sir .
 Most regrettable , and it is of the utmost importance that nothing further should leak out .
 The French and Russian embassies would pay an immense sum to learn its contents .
 This is the original .
 It should not leave my bureau were it not absolutely necessary to have it copied .
 Take it straight to your office and lock it up .
 Now , remain behind when the others go , so that you can work at your leisure and without fear of being overlooked .
 And when you have finished , relock both the original and the draft in your own desk , and hand them over to me personally tomorrow morning .
 The very greatest care , Nephew .
 You may rely on it , sir .
 This treaty , can you be more precise as to its nature ?
 Well , in outline it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple Alliance in the event of the French fleet gaining complete ascendancy over ltaly in the Mediterranean .

 I returned straight to my office where I found a colleague of mine ,
 Mr. Charles Gorot , still working .
 Well , chap , what did Uncle want ?
 To congratulate me on my engagement .
 Splendid .
 Nothing else ?
 Some fishing dispute he wanted me to copy .
 You 're not still on that Bulgarian piece , are you ?
 It 's extremely long- winded and tiresome , and I am fagged out for the night .
 You working late again ?
 Just a few things .
 You want to slack off a bit , old man .
 Ambition is a fine thing and all that , but do not neglect the beautiful Miss Harrison .
 Some other chap might step in .
 She wouldn 't have you , Charles .
 Well , not me , old man .
 I 've got my Daphne .
 Goodnight to you .
 Goodnight .
 You made sure that he was gone before you started work ?
 Quite sure , and I copied as fast as I could , for I knew that Joseph , my fiancé 's brother --
 We met him in the garden .
 He was in town , and was traveling back to Woking by the 11 : 00 o 'clock train .
 And I wanted to catch it , if possible .
 But it was a long document ?
 Written in French .
 By 9 : 00 o 'clock , I was feeling drowsy and scarcely a third of the way through .
 I thought a cup of coffee might clear my brain , so I rang the commissioner who stays on duty all night in a small lodge at the bottom of the stairs .
 To my surprise , it was a woman who answered the summons .
 I 'm sorry , I was ringing for Mr. Tangey .
 I 'm his wife , sir ,
 I do the char work in this building .
 Ah , well , I was wondering if you might bring me a cup of coffee .
 I 'll go and ask him , sir .
 This woman , you 've never noticed her in the building before ?
 Never .
 The coffee was some time coming , so I went down to investigate .
 Leaving the room unguarded ?
 Yes .
 I found Tangey -- asleep .
 Mr. Phelps , sir , I 'm very sorry , sir .
 I must have just dropped off for a moment . Your coffee , sir .

 Well , if you 're here , sir , who 's ringing the bell ?
 Bell , what bell is it ?
 It 's the bell in the room in which you 're working , sir .
 You ran back upstairs and the document was gone from your desk .
 Yes !
 God no --
 You passed no one in the corridor ?
 No one , there was no one !
 And the room and the corridor all seemed exactly as I 'd left it !
 Percy has drawn a rough chart of the building , Mr. Holmes , which he thought might be of use .
 Yes , yes , that 's of the utmost importance , Mr. Holmes .

 Yes , I think I quite follow it .
 On your discovery of the theft , what did you do then ?
 Well , I recognized in an instant the thief must have come up through the side door .
 This one here . Well , you 'd have met him if he 'd come the other way . Yes , of course .


 And you are satisfied that they could not have been concealed in the room or in the corridor ?
 Absolutely impossible .
 All the other doors were locked .
 Strict Foreign Office regulations .
 There was no cover at all .
 A rat couldn 't have concealed himself there .
 Tangey and I both rushed out down the stairs that lead into Charles Street .
 Mr. Phelps !
 The door at the bottom was closed , unlocked .
 It was dark , raining .
 There was no one !
 But I distinctly remember the three- quarters of Big Ben .
 A quarter to ten .
 That is of enormous importance .
 They came out here , you see , Holmes .
 On the corner we found a policeman , but he 'd seen no one leave the building in the last quarter of an hour except for the Commissioner 's wife , so we ran through to Whitehall .
 It was full of traffic , people coming and going , all only too eager to find a place of shelter on so wet a night .
 No lounger to tell you who 'd passed ?
 None .
 Had it been raining all evening ?
 Since about 7 : 00 .
 Ah , this chain of events is certainly of extraordinary interest .
 And so you returned to the office , examined it , I presume , to see if the intruder had left any traces ; muddy foot marks , any cigar end , or dropped glove , hairpin ?
 There was nothing .
 Except the tangible fact that the Commissioner 's wife had run out of the building not ten minutes earlier .
 What did you do next , Mr. Phelps ?
 The constable alerted Scotland Yard .
 It was then for the first time the full horror of my situation came upon me .
 I 'd been so confident of regaining the treaty ,
 I dared not think --
 Watson will tell you
 I was a nervous , sensitive boy at school .
 It 's my nature .
 I thought of my uncle , his cabinet colleagues , the shame I 'd brought upon them , myself , everyone connected with me .
 Although I was the victim of an accident , there are no allowance for accidents in diplomatic circles .
 Ruined , shamefully , hopelessly ruined !
 Steady on , old chap .
 Stand back , will you , Holmes .
 Is the investigation concluded ?
 Adjourned .
 Poor old Percy , terrible strain , all this , career in the balance .
 It seems not to have affected your sister 's devotion .
 How long has she known Mr. Phelps ?
 Well , they met in Northumberland in the winter .
 Percy was traveling on government business in that part of the world .
 It was love at first sight .
 Do your people approve of the match ?
 Indeed , Mr. Holmes , especially when they learned of Percy 's connection with Lord Holdhurst .
 My father is an iron- master , and a staunch supporter of the Conservative Party .
 She came down here to meet Percy 's people , and you came as escort ?
 That 's right , just before they left for America .
 The , um , the wedding is planned for September , if the poor chap recovers .
 I suppose you only intended a short visit , and then came the smash ?
 Mm .
 May I ask you what your occupation is that allows you to while away the summer in Woking ?
 As the eldest son , Mr. Holmes ,
 I have expectations of inheriting my father 's business .
 I also dabble in stocks and shares , which grants me a certain independence .
 My apologies if my question offended you .
 On the night of May the 23rd , had you arranged to meet Mr. Phelps at Waterloo to take the 11 : 00 o 'clock train together ?
 No .
 That may have been his intention , he knew I was in London dining with my stockbroker .
 But I wasn 't expecting to meet him .
 Then thank you for your time , Mr. Harrison .
 Shall I , um , and would you , the sick room .
 Mr. Holmes , I do apologize .
 I feel calmer now , thanks to Watson 's ministration .
 Gently with him , Holmes .
 Ah .
 Mr. Phelps , there is just the matter of the Commissioner 's wife .
 Yes , of course .
 As I remember , shortly after our return to my office ,
 Inspector Forbes of the Yard arrived to take up the case with considerable energy .
 We hired a hansom , and within half an hour we were at the Tangeys ' home in Brixton .
 The door was opened by his eldest daughter .
 Hey , what do you want ?
 Is your mother at home ?
 Not yet .
 She does a night job -- cleaning .
 We 'll wait for her , if you don 't mind .
 In here .
 And you get back in here , now go on , and shut the door .
 After about ten minutes , we heard the front door , and here we made one serious mistake for which I blame myself .
 Mum , there 's two men in the parlor wants to talk to ya ' .
 Oh , my God !
 If it isn 't Mr. Phelps of the office .
 Come , come , who did you think we were when you ran away from us ?
 I thought you was the bailiffs .
 We 've had some trouble with a tradesman .
 Here , let go , let go , let --
 We 've reason to believe that you 've taken a paper of importance from the Foreign Office , and you ran in here to dispose of it .
 Now , you better come back with us to Scotland Yard to be searched .
 Get your hands off me !
 I didn 't take no paper !
 That will be enough --
 There will be peace and quiet .
 Mr. Phelps ... no , stop it !
 You made a full examination of the kitchen ?
 Yes .
 There was no sign of the documents .
 A four- wheeler was brought and we all three drove back in it to Scotland Yard .
 I waited in an agony of suspense until the female searcher came back with her report .
 They found nothing .
 After that , I have no clear recollection .
 I believe a police officer drove me to Waterloo where by the merest good fortune ,
 I met Dr. Ferrier , who lives near us and was traveling down by the next train .
 The train you caught now would have been ?
 The 11 : 40 , I think .
 Dr. Ferrier most kindly took charge of me .
 Just as well he did , for I had a fit in the station and before we reached home I was practically a raving lunatic .
 Your brother had already returned ?
 Yes .
 I was surprised , but not unduly worried that he was alone .
 Percy often worked late , and I knew there was another train .
 So I went to bed .
 And sometime after midnight ?
 I was woken by the most fearful commotion in the hall .
 Bring him in here , bring him in here !
 Oh , God ...
 Your brother was sleeping down here in this room ?
 Yes .
 My family were taking advantage of their trip to America to have several of the upstairs bedrooms redecorated .
 It was evident that poor Percy was in for a long illness .
 So , Joseph was bundled up to my room , and this was turned into a sick room for me .
 Why , it 's a very cheery room .
 I have lain here for nine weeks , delirious .
 If it had not been for Miss Harrison and the doctor 's care ,
 I should not be speaking to you now .
 She nursed me by day , a hired nurse looked after me at night , for in the mad fits I was capable of anything .
 It 's only in the last few days that my reason has slowly cleared .
 I 've wired Inspector Forbes , but he 's told me no clue has been discovered .
 So I turn to you , Mr. Holmes , as my last hope .
 Just one question of the utmost importance , Mr. Phelps .
 Did you tell anyone that you had this special task to perform ?
 No one .
 Not Miss Harrison , for example ?
 No .
 I had not been back to Woking in between getting the order and executing the commission .
 What a lovely thing a rose is .
 There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion .
 It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner .
 Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers .
 It is only goodness which gives extras , and so I say again , we have much to hope for from the flowers .
 Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery , Mr. Holmes ?
 Mystery ?
 Ah , it would be absurd to deny that the case is abstruse and complicated .
 Do you see any clue ?
 You have furnished me with seven , but I must put them to the test before I can pronounce on their value .
 You suspect someone ?
 I suspect ... myself .
 What ?
 Of coming to conclusions too rapidly .
 Then go back to London and test your conclusions !
 Your advice is very excellent , Miss Harrison .
 Mr. Phelps , do not indulge yourself in false hopes , the affair is a very tangled one , and I am not a magician .

 Hey , little varmint !
 What do you think of Miss Harrison ?
 A good sort , or I 'm mistaken .
 I thought you were rather terse with her .
 Was I ?
 She was only protecting her loved one .
 A little overprotective , perhaps .
 Surely , you don 't believe that she had anything to do with it ?
 The most difficult crime to track down , Watson , is the one which is purposeless .
 Now , this is not purposeless , but who is it that profits by it ?
 Well , there 's the French Ambassador , the Russian , and whoever might sell it to either of those .
 And Lord Holdhurst .
 While it is not inconceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to see such a document accidentally destroyed .
 Not a statesman with the honorable record of Lord Holdhurst .
 George , the Foreign Office ,
 Charles Street entrance .
 George , I want you to do something for me .
 Find the cab which dropped a fare there just after half past 9 : 00 on the evening of May the 23rd .
 Gorot , a French name .
 Huguenot , actually .
 But I 'm as English in sympathy as you are , Mr. Holmes .
 Am I under some sort of cloud because of my name ?
 Oh , no , no , Holmes has a French grandmother .
 I 'd make yourself scarce if you want to avoid Inspector Forbes .
 We 've arranged to meet him here in five minutes .
 Yes , I have been questioned by him already .
 I shall do as you say .
 Goodnight to you both . Goodnight .
 Goodnight .
 No secret doors , the windows quite 30 feet above the ground , fastened on the inner side .
 The carpet prevents any possibility of a trap door .
 Now , whoever rang the bell rope must have come right over to the desk .
 Why ring it ?
 I mean , was it the thief , out of bravado ?
 Or was it someone with the thief who tried to prevent the crime ?
 Or was it --
 Inspector Forbes , I believe .
 Mr. Holmes , I 'm a very busy man .
 I have other cases besides this one .
 But none so vital to the national interest , I 'll wager .
 May I introduce my friend and colleague , Dr. Watson ?

 What do you want from me , Holmes ?
 I know about your methods .
 You 're ready enough to use our information , then you try and finish the case yourself and bring discredit on us .
 On the contrary , in my last 53 cases , my name has appeared in only 4 and the police have the credit in 49 .
 I don 't blame you for not knowing this , you are young and inexperienced .
 But if you wish to get on in your duties you will work with me and not against me !
 Now , then , what steps have you taken ?
 Tangey , the commissioner , we 've cleared .
 He left the Guards with a good character .
 His wife is a bad lot , though , she drinks .
 What about the clerk , Gorot ?
 He 's been shadowed all these nine weeks .
 We can show nothing against him .
 Have you formed any theory about how this bell rang ?
 No .
 I must confess , that beats me .
 It was a cool hand , whoever it was , to go and give the alarm like that .
 Yes , yes , it was a very queer thing to do .
 Well , many thanks , Inspector , and if I can put this thief in your hands , you shall hear from me .
 Come along , Watson .
 May I ask where you 're going now ?
 To interview Lord Holdhurst , the Cabinet Minister and very possibly the next Premier of England .
 Good evening , Inspector .
 I can 't pretend , Mr. Holmes , that I am ignorant of the reason for your visit , but in whose interests are you acting , may I ask ?
 In the part of Mr. Percy Phelps .
 Ah , my unfortunate nephew .
 You can understand that our kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way .
 Yes , but if the document is found , Lord Holdhurst ?
 That , of course , would be different .
 Lord Holdhurst , it was in this room that you gave instructions for the copying of the document ?
 It was .
 And you mentioned it to nobody else except your nephew , you 're certain of that ?
 Absolutely .
 Then if nobody else knew of it , you would agree that the thief 's presence in your nephew 's room was purely accidental .
 I mean , he saw his chance and took it .
 You take me out of my province there , Mr. Holmes .

 There is one other very important point .
 You feared , so I understand , that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known ?
 Very grave results indeed .
 Have they occurred ?
 Not yet .
 If the treaty had reached , let us say , the Russian or the French Foreign Office , you would expect to hear of it ?
 I certainly should .
 Then since nearly ten weeks have elapsed , it is not unfair to suppose then that the treaty for some reason has not reached them .
 But Holmes , we can hardly suppose that the thief took the treaty in order to ... frame it and hang it on his wall .
 Well , perhaps he 's waiting for a better price , Watson .
 Or maybe he 's had a sudden illness .
 A brain storm , for example ?
 I did not say so .
 Lord Holdhurst , we have taken up too much of your valuable time .
 Fine fellow , heavy responsibilities .
 Yes , but he has a struggle to keep up his position , and he 's far from rich .
 You noticed , of course , that his boots had been resoled .
 Really ? !
 I shall do nothing more today unless I get an answer to my cab inquiry .
 Ah .
 All right .
 Oh , Watson , I won 't detain you any longer from your legitimate work .
 But I should be extremely obliged if you would come down to Woking with me tomorrow , the same train that we took today .
 Yes , of course .
 Goodnight , Holmes .
 No , no , tonight I shall sleep my own sleep , and alone .
 But Percy .
 Mr. Holmes has imbued me with fresh hope , and I feel I 'm on the mend .

 We have an appointment in church in September , my love , and I mean to keep it .
 He sent the nurse away .
 At last .
 He puts too much faith in the great detective .
 It 's you that 's kept his flame alive , not some detective .
 And you , brother .
 Without you to support me --
 Could it be that I am the center of some monstrous conspiracy , and that my life is aimed at , as well as my honor ?
 I haven 't as far as I know , an enemy in the world !
 You certainly have had your share of misfortune , old chap .
 I think I may have found the spot where the fella ' scaled the wall !
 It 's towards the road .
 Ah , do you think this was done last night ?
 It looks rather old to me .
 No , I fancy we shall get no help there .
 Now , why did the intruder choose the window onto the courtyard ?
 I should have thought this side of the house would have been easier .
 It 's more visible from the courtyard .
 Ah , yes , of course .
 Have you ever had an alarm like this before ?
 There 's no plate in the house , or anything to attract burglars ?
 Nothing of value .
 Was there anything in London ?
 Well , we 've seen Inspector Forbes , we 've seen your uncle .
 Holmes has set one or two things in motion .
 So you 've not lost heart .
 Oh , by no means !
 God bless you for saying that .
 If we keep our courage and patience , the truth must come out .
 Miss Harrison , you must remain in this room for the rest of the day .
 It is of vital importance .
 Now , tonight , when you go to bed ,
 lock that door from the outside and keep the key . But Percy ?
 Tell no one !
 Now , quick , promise !
 Why are you moping in here , honey ?
 Come out in the sunshine .
 I 'll be your crockie .
 I have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing , thank you , Joseph .
 Mr. Phelps , while we 're investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry .
 It would help me very much if you would come up to London with us .
 Do you feel strong enough ?
 Yes , if you really think I can be of help .
 Do you want me to stay the night ?
 I was on the point of proposing it .
 Then if my friend of the night comes to visit me , he 'll find the bird flown .
 But , what about Annie ?
 Ah , Mr. Harrison will look after her , and my friend Watson will take care of your medical needs .
 Could you be ready to leave in an hour ?
 We are all in your hands , Mr. Holmes .
 There are one or two points I wish to clear up , and your absence , Mr. Phelps , will rather assist me .
 Watson , when you reach London drive our friend straight to Baker Street and remain with him until I see you again .
 And now , gentlemen , I shall leave you .
 What about our investigation in London ? !
 I hope to be in London in time for breakfast .
 He really is the most inscrutable fellow , Watson .
 Oh , you 're still in here .
 How 's your headache ?
 A little better .
 The first day for nine weeks without the invalid , and you choose to spend it in here .
 Force of habit .
 Are you dining tonight ?
 I 'm not hungry , and I 'm enjoying my book .
 Mm , I understand .
 My poor little sister , what a time you 've had .
 That 'll be Mr. Holmes returning now , sir .
 Thank you , Horace .
 He looks like a beaten man .
 I confess you may be right .
 I 'd hoped for so much !
 Holmes , you 're wounded !
 Oh , it 's only a scratch through my own clumsiness .
 Good morning , Mr. Phelps , this case of yours is certainly one of the darkest I have ever investigated .
 It has been a remarkable experience .
 Oh , come along , Holmes , that bandage tells of adventures .
 Now , what happened ?
 After breakfast , my dear Watson .
 Remember , I have breathed 30 miles of Surrey air this morning .
 There 's been no answer to my cab inquiry , I suppose ?
 Well , one cannot score every time .
 Mrs. Hudson , you have risen to the occasion .
 Won 't you join us , Mr. Phelps ?
 Now , what 's in this ?
 Curried chicken , sir . And this ?

 Ham and eggs .
 Her cuisine is a little limited , but she has as good an idea of breakfast as any Scotswoman .
 Now , what will you take , Mr. Phelps , curried fowl , eggs , or will you help yourself ?
 Thank you .
 I can eat nothing .
 Oh , please , try the dish before you .
 Thank you , I would really rather not .
 Oh , well , then , I suppose you have no objection to helping me ?
 Oh !
 It 's the treaty .
 It 's the treaty .
 It 's the treaty .
 My God , it 's the treaty !
 It 's the treaty !
 It 's the treaty !
 Watson , brandy .
 Ah , there , there , there , it really was too bad of me to spring it on you like that , but Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic .
 God bless you for saving my honor .
 Thank you , Mrs. Hudson .
 Oh , thank you for your many considerations .
 A Scotswoman 's breakfast , indeed , a silly bit of paper !
 Please , tell me how you got it , where it was !
 After I left you ,
 I settled myself into the English countryside and spent a charming afternoon .
 I remained there until dusk , and then I returned to your house .
 I clambered over the wall and made my way through the undergrowth until I reached the stables , just opposite your bedroom window .
 The blind in your window had not yet been drawn , and I could see Miss Harrison reading a book by the light from a lamp .

 It was about a quarter- past ten when she closed the book , moved across the room , carrying the lamp with her .
 But I felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock .
 Key ?
 The instructions I gave her , which she carried out to the letter .
 Mr. Phelps , she is a lady of rare character .
 Without her cooperation , you would not have that paper in your hand now .
 It was a weary vigil , but it had the sort of excitement a sportsman feels when he lies before the watercourse and waits for the big game .

 What happened , what happened ? !
 It was about 2 : 00 o 'clock in the morning , when I heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back .
 All right .
 All right , Holmes , what you gonna do with me ?
 I 've got what I want .
 Ow ! -- Run .
 Joseph !
 You let him go ? !
 I wired full particulars to Inspector Forbes .
 If he 's quick enough to catch his bird , well and good .
 But if , as I shrewdly suspect , he finds the nest empty , why , all the better for the government .
 I fancy Lord Holdhurst , for one , and Mr. Percy Phelps for another , would much rather the affair never got to a police court .
 My God , do you tell me that during my 10 long weeks of agony the stolen papers were in the very room with me all the time ?
 And Joseph , a villain and a thief !
 From what I gather , he had lost heavily dabbling in stocks , and concealed the fact from his father , a man of strictly conservative habits .
 Yes , but his own sister 's happiness , and your reputation , your health !
 He knew that you often worked late , and he was in town having dinner with his stockbroker , as he told me .
 But he was free by half past 9 : 00 , and called by your office , entering through the side door .
 Percy ?
 Finding no one in there but the light on and work evidently in progress , he rang the bell .
 The instant he did so , his eye caught the paper on the table .
 He knew at once that chance had put in his way a state document of immense value ,
 returned alone to Woking and concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place , intending to remove it in a day or two , and take it to the French embassy or wherever he thought a long price was to be had .

 There 's nobody there , there 's nobody there !
 Then came your sudden return .
 Without a moment 's warning he was bundled out of his room and from that moment on , there were always at least two of you in there , preventing him from regaining his treasure , maddening for him .
 My suspicions became certainties when the attempt to break in was made on the first night that the hired nurse was absent , which showed that the intruder was well accustomed with the ways of the house .



 At last , he had his chance .
 But you baffled him with your wakefulness . Yes !
 I didn 't take my sleeping draft !
 But he had another chance when you came up to London .
 I kept Miss Harrison in the room all day so as to anticipate him .
 But if you already knew the papers were in the room ?
 I thought they probably were , but I had no desire to rip up all the skirting in search of them .
 By allowing him to lead me to the hiding place ,
 I saved myself an infinity of trouble .
 And caught him red- handed !
 Quite so .
 Yes , but why did he try the window when he might have come in through the door ?
 To appear to be a burglar , and if necessary , make good his escape across the courtyard .
 The knife , you don 't think he had any murderous intentions ?
 My dear fellow ,
 I can only say that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust .
 That will be a young lady for you , Mr. Phelps .

 Annie !
 I left her a note to come to London the moment she woke .
 But Mr. Phelps , she knows nothing as yet of her brother 's criminality .
 Oh , yes .
 My dear Holmes , I can 't thank you enough .
 I shall go down at once and explain everything .
 Percy , good- bye , and good luck !
 Thank you for restoring my happiness .
 There 's a young lady at the door , sir .
 Mr. Holmes , hot water !
 Thank you .
