 Is anybody here ?
 It appears there may have been a breakdown in our chain of care .
 Are you trying to buy us off ?

 There 's this place called Camp Hennessy .
 I 'm not going to a stupid camp for juvenile delinquents !
 You don 't have a choice .
 We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake .
 I must have sold several hundreds of these , just like it .
 We have a list of customers ' names on file .
 I won 't tell anyone .
 I 'll keep your secret , Dad .








 I 'm so lucky to have you .
 OK , I 'll bite .
 Why are you so lucky ?
 Because --
 I don 't want to have kids and you do .
 - Oh , that .
 Most men would leave over something like that .
 And you 're still here .
 I 'm grateful .
 I know the sacrifice you 're making .
 There 's still a little part of me that 's hoping you 'd change your mind .
 Once you had a baby , I think you 'd love it so much that ...
 Honey -- it 's not gonna happen .
 You never know .
 No , sometimes you do .
 Well , it is a sacrifice .
 But you 're worth it .





 episode 18 CHlLDREN WlLL LlSTEN






 Sorry to bother you on the weekend .
 We have a few questions .
 About what ?
 12 years ago , your late wife purchased a toy chest .

 Toy chest .
 Yes , about this big and with little dancing bears on it ?
 Gosh , I 'm sorry .
 The craftsman who makes these chests keeps a list of customers .
 Apparently you purchased one in August 1992 .
 We 'd like to know where that chest is now .
 Well , I wish I could help you .
 I don 't recall any toy chest .
 I remember .
 It had little bears and blooms on it , right ?
 Yes , son , that 's right .
 We threw that chest away when I was little .
 I was standing on it and it busted .
 Remember , Dad ?
 Vaguely .
 I guess that 's all then .
 Thank you both for your time .
 Hey -- what 's the deal with this chest anyway ?
 One just like you had washed up on Torch Lake .
 Had a woman in it .
 A woman ?
 She was all chopped up .
 Obviously , we need to talk .
 You lie filth .
 You said there was a man in the box !
 No , I didn 't lie .
 The policeman said it was a woman 's body !
 Of course you lied !
 I told you a private detective would come to take you away from us .
 I never said it was a man .
 You didn 't ?
 - No .
 Why -- I -- I thought that ...
 - No .
 Stop , please , stop , I -- I know that you 're lying for me .
 Ok , I know that you 're lying .
 For the last time :
 Someone came and tried to take you away from us -- Yes , a woman !
 A woman came .
 - Yes , she tried to steal you .
 From the only family that you 've ever really known .
 And we couldn 't let that happen .
 And we didn 't .
 And that -- is the truth .
 We can 't cancel now , it 's two days away !
 Rex , I 'm not going .
 That 's all there is to it .
 Counselling is part of the treatment at Camp Hennessy . You knew that .
 Nowhere in that brochure did it say that we were expected to attend .
 What will Andrew think if you don 't show up ?
 I 'm making him his care package !
 He 'll know that I 'm thinking about him .
 Why are you putting in lemon squares ?
 They told us not to send him sweets .
 Well , I don 't understand why .
 I guess they feel baked goods from Mom undercut the boot camp experience .
 Fine !
 I won 't send them . But I think it 's a stupid rule .
 So are you going to this thing or not ?
 No .
 - Why ?
 Because the minute I get there , Andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him .
 And I don 't want to hear it .
 There 's no reason to feel guilty .
 You did everything you could for him .
 I don 't feel guilty .
 OK .
 Please , Christie -- there 's no way I can get another babysitter this late in the day .

 Parker ! Knock it off !
 Because I 'm having drinks with friends I used to work with , and they never call , and if I blow them off , that 's it .
 I 'm dead to them .
 No , I can 't call Patty Binks .
 Because she steals things .
 Damn it , Christie , you 're 13 .
 You got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you .
 OK . I 'm sorry .
 I 'm sorry I raised my boys . -- I 'm calm .
 I 'm starting to think this is about money .
 So what is it that will make it worth your while ? $100 ?
 That 's extorsion !
 There 's no way in hell that I --
 Hello ?
 Hello ?
 Parker , I swear I will spank you !
 Knock it off !
 Hi , Mrs Binks . Is Patty there ?
 Thank you .
 Hi honey , I 'm back .
 Hey sweetie .
 This is Mr Steinberg , the attorney from the hospital .
 Oh , have we met ?
 Yes , Mrs Solís .
 We 've met .
 Don 't you remember ?
 Was that when Mamá died ?
 Apparently , the hospital was negligent and agreed to a 7- figure settlement cheque .
 A cheque I was never told about .
 Oh , that !
 Uh --
 Mr Steinberg --
 I was just leaving .
 What were you thinking ? ! Wait !
 Let me explain ! No !
 Why the hell didn 't you tell me ?
 Because I couldn 't trust you to make the right decision .
 The right decision was to use that money for my lawyers .
 We could have bought the indictment , and I wouldn 't have had to take a plea bargain .
 If you didn 't take the plea deal , the Government would have seized the settlement .
 Ow , we could have bought that at court .
 Exactly , and then you would have blown all the money into the lawyers !
 Who cares ?
 If there was a chance that I 'd have to go to jail ?
 You had Laotian convicts sowing casual wear for 2¢/ h .
 Don 't you think you deserve a time out ?
 8 months !
 Thanks to you , I 'm going away for 8 months !
 And when you get out , we have money to start over with .
 Thanks to me .
 You know , once you calm down you 'll realize I did the right thing .
 And when that happens , I 'd appreciate an apology .
 Grandma 's here !
 Now that is just perfect .
 Stay put .
 I 'm so sorry --
 Hey , Mom !
 Hey Susan .
 I goofed .
 What happened ?
 Oh , you know me .
 No depth perception whatsoever .
 Some day I gonna shoot my licence .
 So you 're Susan 's mom ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm Sophie Bremer . And you are ?
 Mike Delfino .
 Oh !
 You 're Mike ?
 Oh my god !
 Susan 's told me so much about you !
 Don 't you stand there , give me a hug !

 Mom -- Mike and I aren 't -- together anymore .
 Oh .
 Sorry . I guess I just made this very awkward , ha ?
 Yeah , you really did .
 So let 's call your insurance company .
 Well -- it 's nice meeting you anyway , Mike .
 You too .
 And I 'd never guessed that you 're Susan 's mom .
 I know .
 I look too young .
 I got pregnant when I was a tiny teenager . OK .
 That was the first time I got drunk .
 Ever . Can you believe it ? Let 's go .
 Her father was a Marine .
 Afterwards , he gave me three of his medals .
 Mom !
 Let 's just go inside and call the insurance company .
 All right .
 What are you smiling about ?
 I used to have all these questions about how you got to be the way you are .
 They 're all just answered .
 Hi !
 Hi !
 Hi !
 What 's going on ?
 Oh , um --
 My babysitter cancelled .
 Oh Lynette , I -- I 'm so swamped today .
 My house is a mess , and I 've got millions of errands to run , so --
 Please , hear me out .
 This is important .
 Today I have a chance to rejoin the human race for a few hours .
 There are actual adults waiting for me with Margaritas .
 Look , I 'm in a dress !
 I have make- up on !
 If it were any other day -- - For god 's sakes , Bree , I 'm wearing pantyhose !
 Bring them in .
 Thank you , thank you .
 OK , in you go !
 And then the police showed me his mugshot .
 - No ! Yes !
 Mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter .
 I can 't believe it .
 - Well , it 's true .
 He has such nice manners , you know ?
 I know .
 Suzie -- I don 't want you worrying too much about this Mike thing .
 The right man will come along .
 Just give it time .
 I think I would have given up entirely if it weren 't for you and Morty .
 Morty ?
 - Yeah , you know --
 It 's the 3rd time round for both of you , and you 're really clicking .
 Gives me hope .
 What 's wrong ?
 Nothing , nothing .
 I 'm just -- tired .
 You 're not tired .
 You took a nap .
 What is it ?
 I left Morty .
 What ?
 Why ?
 Because he shoved me .
 Morty ? No !
 You think I 'm lying ?
 Fine ! Why would he shove you ?
 Because I confronted him about how much time he was spending at that damn pancake restaurant .
 If that 's where he 's really been .
 You can 't be serious . Morty ?
 You think men his age don 't have needs ?
 You should see the waitresses he hires .
 Every year they get younger and younger .
 Maybe you just feel that way because every year you get older and older .
 That 's a horrible thing to say .
 I 'm sorry .
 I 'm not that old . I said I was sorry .
 People think we are sisters .
 Well , that 's 'cause you tell them that .
 One time !
 You gotta like all that .
 OK , look .
 I 'm just saying I don 't think Morty cheated on you .
 Well he did shove me .
 The least you can do is be supportive .
 You 're right . You 're right !
 He also threw a book at me .
 Oh come on !
 I mean -- he shouldn 't have done that .
 Thank you .
 Porter , honey , those cookies are hot .
 Wait a few minutes , I 'll give you one when they 're cool , OK ?
 Um -- you know , pictures are prettier if you color inside the lines .
 Well , art is subjective .
 Porter ! What did I tell you ?
 But I 'm hungry !
 Then I will fix you a very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese .
 Ew , barf !
 Don 't be common , young man !
 Now come on .
 If you play around with those cookies one more time ,
 I 'm gonna have to spank you !
 We don 't get spanked .
 - Really ?
 Mummy always says she 's gonna , but she never does .
 Well , I am not your mummy , and if you misbehave in my house , you will get spanked .
 So be good .


 It was an accident !
 Porter , I warned you .
 I 'm sorry .
 I 'll be good . Those cookies were made from scratch .
 Your fate is sealed !
 Come here .
 - No , no !
 Ow ! Ow ! Ow !
 Owwww !
 What 's that ?
 It 's called a postnuptial agreement .
 It 's a legal document that --
 I know what a postnup is .
 What is it doing on my coffee table ?
 Well , I can forgive that stunt you pulled with the settlement cheque , if I 'm sure that you 'll really be around when I get out of jail .
 Hm .
 And the postnup changes the terms of the prenup , so --
 So if you try and divorce me while I 'm gone , you get nothing .
 You don 't trust me ?
 Free , no .
 Well , that 's too bad , because I 'm not signing that paper .
 You 're a very beautiful woman , Gabrielle , but -- you 're not very bright .
 See , if you don 't sign it ,
 I 'll pull the plug on the settlement agreement , divorce you , and then you get about 50 % of our current savings , which is basically nothing .

 So what do you expect to happen now , Carlos ?
 I sign the paper and jump right back into your arms ?
 It doesn 't mean that I don 't love you .
 I think you 're the perfect woman .
 Oh , but I 'm not .
 I have flaws .
 Flaws ? - M- hm .
 I 'll give you an example .
 Remember when you were in jail and you told me about your secret compartment ?
 And you told me to burn the papers that I found in there ?
 Well , me being pretty and therefore stupid , I forgot .
 You didn 't burn the papers .
 Worse .
 I read them .
 OK --
 You have some nerve talking to me about trust when you have a secret bank account on the Cayman Islands !
 That was a safety net for both of us ! I 'll bet .
 Have you told anyone else about this ?
 No . But I could .
 Hey , isn 't that why the prosecution didn 't have a case against you ?
 They couldn 't find the profits you made .
 So if I were you , Carlos ,
 I wouldn 't mention the words " divorce " ,
 " trust " , " postnup " ever again .
 You don 't want to piss me off .
 I know , baby .
 It hurts to lose .
 Ante up .
 Well , look at me !
 Finally in at one of your legendary Poker Parties .
 Susan 's always telling me how much fun you girls have .
 The rules are simple :
 We play for cash , the dealer picks the game , and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged .
 - Aaah !
 Bree , thanks again for watching my boys .
 Sure they weren 't too much to handle ?
 Oh , no . We had a wonderful time .
 Although I think Porter had a little less fun .
 OK , I 'll bet .
 Sophie , Susan said you guys are going to the spa tomorrow ?
 All day ?
 What do you mean , Porter had less fun ?
 I 'll raise .
 He was misbehaving , so I had to punish him .
 So , yes !
 Susan is treating me to an entire day of ...
 If you say punishment , what exactly are we talking about ?
 Well , I had to spank him .
 OK , I will re- raise .
 You spanked my son ?
 Las Brisas spa .
 Yep , that 's where we 're going !
 Lynette , is there a problem ?
 Tom and I don 't believe in hitting our kids .
 I thought you knew that .
 Sorry .
 I didn 't know .
 It won 't happen again .
 Of course , I 'm somewhat surprised you don 't spank them .
 Everybody knows they 're a little bit -- out of control .
 I 'm just dragging today .
 Should we put on another pot of coffee ?
 Yeah , I 'll do it .
 I 'll -- I fold .
 Yeah , you 're right , Bree .
 I 've got a lot to learn about parenting .
 I feel blessed to get sage advice from such an impeccable mother like you .
 I mean , your kids turned out perfect .
 As long as you don 't count Andrew .
 Where is he again ?
 Hm ?
 Some kind of , uh -- boot camp for juvenile delinquents ?
 OK , girls .
 I never said I was perfect .
 Oh honey , nobody 's blaming you .
 - The hell I 'm not .
 Lynette !
 If you will excuse me .
 Lynette , won 't you go after her ?
 She spanked my son .
 I 'm not apologizing .
 Usually poker is more fun than this .
 Help me . If you don 't back me up on this , I will lose it .

 Yes , Bree shouldn 't have spanked Porter , but -- it 's not like she hurt him .
 That is not the point .
 You don 't spank other people 's children !
 He was misbehaving .
 She had to do something .
 B- but make no mistake , she definitely crossed the line .
 Yeah , you 're damn right , she could 've tried something else , like a time- out .
 Or she could 've simply threatened to spank him .
 Yeah . 'Cause that works out so well when we do it .
 It does work .
 Most of the time .
 It used to work .
 They figured out it 's an empty threat .
 They 're on to us .
 My mom used to beat the hell out of my sisters and me .
 And I won 't do it .
 I will not become my mother .
 Fine .
 But the boys are getting older and smarter .
 And eventually -- believe me -- they 'll figure out that they outnumber us .
 And then -- - We 're screwed .
 Exactly .
 Excuse me , Zachary .
 Would you mind helping me with these bags ?
 There 's some banana bread in it for you if you do .
 Uh -- yeah , sure .
 Hm .
 This is really good , Mrs Tilman .
 Thanks a lot .
 You 're welcome , Zachary .
 I 've never actually been in Mrs Huber 's house before .
 Obviously you haven 't missed much .
 This is the place where good taste goes to die .
 So -- I heard you and your father arguing the other day .
 Evetrything all right at home ?
 Yeah . We just have -- problems sometimes .
 I bet you miss your mother .
 I 'm sure things were different when she was alive .
 Such a warm , loving woman .
 You -- knew my mother ?
 Yup . Years ago , in Utah .
 We worked together .
 I didn 't know that .
 It 's true .
 In fact --
 I 'll tell you a secret .
 I once met you when you were a little baby .
 Really ?
 M- hm .
 Your mother loved you so much , Zachary .
 Of all the things I remember , I remember that the most .
 You want to know what else I remember ?
 How lovely your original name was .
 Dana .
 Isn 't this nice .
 Just the two of us girls hanging out , getting pretty .
 Aw , thank you !
 - My pleasure .
 So -- I was thinking maybe you should call Morty .
 You know , to start working things out ?
 Why would I want to work things out with a man who abuses me ?
 Oh , you don 't have to gasp .
 My mother -- exaggerates .
 She won 't be happy till I have bruises .
 OK , um -- can we just focus ?
 What I want to know is , have you thought about what 'll happen if you don 't go back to Morty ?
 What do you mean ?
 You don 't have a place to live , you don 't like to work , you didn 't want to marry Morty , so he doesn 't have to pay you alimony -- if you don 't go back to this man who allegedly shoved you once in 5 years , what are your options ?




 I thought I could live with you .
 What ?
 Oh my god , are you all right ? Get away !
 - I 'm so sorry -- Lean back .
 I 'm not saying permanently .
 Just for a couple of years .
 You broge by dose !
 No , no , it 's just banged a little .
 Till I get back on my feet . - Can we talk about this later ?
 Should we call 911 ?
 No , it 's just a nosebleed .
 She 's fine .
 Won 't you be excited by the idea ?
 It 's not that I 'm not excited .
 I 'm not stupid , Susan .
 It 's obvious you don 't want me here .
 No , that 's not true !
 Mom -- Don 't go !
 Mom , come back !
 I need to -- We 're good , right ?
 Just go !
 Why aren 't you dressed yet ?
 I wanted to wear Andrew 's favorite color , and then I realized --
 I don 't know what it is .
 I think the fact you decided to come at all would make him happy .
 Yours is blue .
 Danielle loves pink .
 And I have no idea what my own son 's favorite color is .
 I 'm telling you , it doesn 't matter .
 How can you say that ?
 Of course it matters !
 Bree -- - That is what makes a good mother !
 Someone who knows their child inside and out , so that if they get in trouble , they know what to do .
 I don 't know him well enough .
 You are a good mother .
 Brown or green or -- just don 't know .
 I 'll wait in the car .
 Whenever you 're ready .
 Green .
 I 'll go with the green .
 Everybody loves green .
 Told you .
 I 'm not signing this .
 Oh , I think you are .
 Because if you don 't --
 I will divorce you .
 Then I 'll go to the police .
 And tell them what ?
 That there 's a secret bank account on the Cayman Islands that no longer exists ?
 You moved the money ?
 - Of course I moved the money .
 But -- that was risky !
 The Feds are watching you right now .
 I had to do something .
 Couldn 't let you make a fool out of me .

 Stop , Carlos !
 Stop it ! Put me down !
 - OK .
 Put me down --
 Let me go !
 Stop !
 You 're hurting me , Carlos !
 Sign it .
 SlGN IT !
 I know , baby .
 It hurts to lose .
 Mr and Ms Van de Kamp ?
 Uh , yes . Is it our turn ?
 Well , uh -- sort of .
 Andrew 's waiting inside , but --
 What 's wrong ?
 He said he won 't go forward with the session if -- his mother is about .
 He only wants to talk to his dad .
 We drove 200 miles to be here today .
 This is unacceptable .
 I share your frustration .
 To hell with him then . We 're going home . No .
 - I won 't let him insult you like this !
 He blames me for his being here .
 He blames me for everything .
 And he 's probably right .
 Any mistakes made were made by both of us .
 One of us should go talk to him , see how he is .
 I 'm OK .
 Are you sure ?
 - Yeah , I 'm fine .
 Right this way .
 Mom ! Mom !!
 - I 'm coming .
 What is it ? Why aren 't you guys brushing your teeth ?
 Parker , what happened ?
 Porter pushed me and it fell in !
 - He pushed me first !
 Can I flush it ?
 No , I 'll fish it out later .
 You 're off the hook for tonight .
 But not you two , so start brushing .
 Preston , did you not hear me ?
 Start brushing your teeth !
 What are you doing ?
 Don 't You Dare .
 Do it ! Do it ! Do it !
 Do it !
 Do it ! Do it ! - Preston , don 't listen to them .
 Back away from the toilet , and no one gets hurt .
 I mean it this time !
 These are not just words !
 If you do this , so help me --


 I will walk you over to Mrs Van de Kamp 's , and we all know what happens when she gets mad .
 Now go brush your teeth , and I want them to sparkle !
 Go on !
 Sorry you had to bring your kid back .
 What happened this time ?
 Well , a couple of months back I caught Ty going through my purse .
 Hard bacon have you got .
 Was he looking for real money ?
 Who knows at this point .
 Anyway , I knocked a couple back and things got heated , pretty soon we 're both screaming , throwing stuff around the apartment --
 Next thing you know , the lady upstairs calls the cops on us .
 Aw , gimme a break .
 So now I got some social worker trying to tell me how to raise my boy . Kids .
 If I knew then what I know now , I 'd have had that hysterectomy 20 years ago .
 Bree -- - Don 't get up .
 I 'll be quick .
 Andrew .
 All any parent can do is try to provide their child with the tools to succeed in life .
 Education , love , a good clean safe home .
 I have given you those things , and I am through feeling guilty .
 So if you want to piss your life away and blame it on how horrible things are , go ahead .
 But I want it stated for the record that I am a good mother .
 Did you hear me ?
 I -- am a good -- mother .
 Bree .
 Andrew just told me he thinks he might be gay .
 What ?
 That 's why he wanted me to come in first .
 He thought I could take it better .
 Well , that 's right .
 I will be waiting in the car .
 Mrs Solís !
 Where are you going to ?
 OK --
 Are your roommates here ?
 - No .
 Are you OK ?
 - Yeah .
 What 's this ?
 - That -- uh --
 Carlos just got a little rough .
 Made me sign some paper .
 Did he hurt you ?
 John , what are you doing ?
 I 'll take care of this .
 You won 't do anything .
 We won 't let him get away with this .
 You really want to get back on him ?
 Then kiss me .
 How 's that gonna help ?
 - Does .
 One day , when the time is right , I 'll tell him how he drove me right into your arms .
 And that will kill him .
 And tonight -- whatever you do , don 't call me beautiful .
 Oh Morty , look who 's here !
 Hey Molly , hi .
 Suzie , what brings you here ?
 Mom .
 She 's right over there .
 What 's she doing out there ?
 She says she won 't come in until you go out and apologize .
 But for what ?
 For shoving her .
 I only shoved her ' cause she wouldn 't stop hitting me .
 Why was she hitting you ?
 I threw -- threw a book at her .
 Morty ! - It was a paperback !
 Even so !
 - At least I missed .
 And she -- she hit me square in the gut .
 Wanna see the bruise ?
 - That 's OK .
 It really hurt .
 - I understand .
 So -- could you just go out and apologize ?

 No . - Why ?
 ' Cause I don 't want her back . Morty ?
 - Look , I 'd love her .
 But -- the pancake shack is just starting to take off .
 We 're talking about hooking in another one .
 That 's practically a chain .
 I don 't have time for her hysterics .
 I sympathize , I really do .
 But you have to take her back . Why ?
 - Because she wants to move in with me . Oh .
 Morty , I 'd like to have a relationship again , and at my age , with the kid --
 If she moves into my house , even for a couple of years , I 'm doomed .
 Wasn 't there a plum -- Your mother said you 're in love with a plumber .
 I am . I mean , I was .
 It didn 't work out .
 - I 'm sorry .
 And she will burn up all my oxygen , and I need it .
 Please , can 't you give her another chance ?
 You guys are really good together .
 You know , when -- when there 's no violence .
 We do have chemistry .
 - Absolutely .
 And the sex was like -- wow .
 There was this one time we were coming home on the Interstate --
 You don 't have to sell me .
 Just go talk to her .
 Now .
 OK .
 That was a mighty big sigh .
 I just keep thinking it 's coming nearer and I can 't stop it .
 - What ?
 The day my mother will need to move in with me , and I won 't have a choice .
 Mhm . - You know , it 's years away .
 She 's youthful and vibrant , thank god .
 But time flies .
 One day , she won 't be able to take care of herself anymore and I have to step up .
 - I suppose that 's true .
 It 's nature 's little joke that children ultimately end up parenting their parents .
 When that day comes , I 'll be ready .
 Honey , you better get out there .


 Hey .
 I just wanted to apologize . - Lynette . Don 't .
 The fact that you just crossed that street means the world to me .
 And if anyone here should apologize , it 's me .
 Thank you .
 Looks like Tom 's got the mob under control .
 You want to have some coffee ?
 Sit around -- bitch about that case --
 I would love to .
 - OK .
