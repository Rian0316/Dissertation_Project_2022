 Kids up yet ?

 We handed over all the cash that we 'd made so far this summer and we still owe him , like , six grand .
 That 's the money that we count on to get us through the winter .
 Well , what was it , some kind of bet ?
 Oh , ten grand , you believe that ?
 Now we 'll be lucky if we can bank enough to get us to Christmas .
 Yeah , hey , V , can we at least save some for the ice cream truck , you know , keep it stocked all summer ? How much is that ?
 One bag should do it .
 All right , but less than an ounce on the truck at one time .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 All right .
 Sure , take a bag . It 's the least we can do to thank you for your hard work .
 No , no , not you , Johnny appleseed .

 You Lip ?

 Nice shirt .
 Should about do it .
 Shit .
 Well , good afternoon , sleepyhead .
 Where 's breakfast ?

 You even missed lunch .
 I 'm not a short- order cook , sweetie .
 So ... I 'm off for my walk .
 108 steps today is the goal .
 I might even make it to the mailbox .
 There 's lucky charms in the pantry and milk in the fridge .
 Okay , bye .
 Great looking tomatoes .
 Heirlooms ? Yes , they are , cherokee purples . Hope I can talk you

 - Of course . It 's all in the compost .
 I can give you some worms to get you started .
 Really ? That 'd be great . I was thinking I should start a garden .
 You should .
 I 'll go change , grab a shovel .
 Hey , Tony .
 Five minutes , 23 seconds ?
 Be happy with anything under six .
 On your mark , get set .
 Go !
