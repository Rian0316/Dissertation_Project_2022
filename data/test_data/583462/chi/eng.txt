 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent Iights .
 Does it get better than this ?
 Question :
 You 're not dating , are you ?
 I met somebody who would be perfect for you .
 You see , perfect might be a problem .
 Had you said co- dependent or self- destructive . . . .

 It 's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles after that .
 Is that ridiculous ? Can you believe she actuaIly thought that ?
 When I first met you , I thought maybe . . . . . . possibly . . . . . . you might be .
 You did ?
 Then you spent Phoebe 's birthday party talking to my breasts . . . . . . so then I figured maybe not .
 Did any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me ?
 - I did .
 - I think so . - Not me .
 - No , no , me neither .
 Although back in coIlege , Susan Saladore did .
 You 're kidding .
 - Did you teII her I wasn 't ?
 - No . It 's because I wanted to go out with her too .
 So I told her , actuaIly , you were seeing Bernie SpeIlman . . .
 . . . who also Iiked her .
 WeIl , this is fascinating .
 So what is it about me ?
 I don 't know .
 Because you 're smart , you 're funny . . . .
 So is Ross .
 You ever think that about him ? Yeah , right !
 What is it ?
 I don 't know .
 You just -- You have a quality .
 Yes , exactly .
 Yeah , a quality . " A quality . " Good .
 I was worried you were gonna be vague about this .
 It 's Paolo caIling from Rome .
 Oh , my God !
 CaIling from Rome !

 So he 's caIling from Rome .
 I could do that . Just gotta go to Rome .
 Your Dad just beeped in .
 Can you make it quick ?
 I 'm talking to Rome .
 I 'm talking to Rome .
 Hey , Dad . What 's up ?
 Oh , God .
 Ross , it 's Nana .
 - How you doing ?
 - Hey , Dad .
 How 's she doing ?
 The doctor says it 's a matter of hours .
 - How are you , Mom ? - Me ? I 'm fine , fine .
 I 'm glad you 're here .
 What 's with your hair ? What ?
 What 's different ?
 Nothing .
 Oh , maybe that 's it .
 She 's unbelievable .
 Her mother 's -- Okay , relax .
 We are gonna be here a while , it Iooks Iike .
 We stiII have boyfriends and your career to cover .
 Oh , God !
 The fuzzy Iittle mints at the bottom of her purse . Yeah , they were gross .
 You know what I Iove ?
 Her Sweet 'N Lows .
 How she was always stealing them from restaurants .
 Not just from restaurants , from our house .
 Mrs. GeIler ?
 She Iooks so smaIl .
 I know .
 WeIl , at Ieast she 's with Pop- Pop and Aunt PhyIlis now .
 Goodbye , Nana .
 Bye , Nana .

 Nurse !
 What is going on ?
 You know how the nurse said Nana had passed ? WeIl , she 's not quite .
 What ? She 's not passed !
 She 's present ! She 's back !
 What 's going on ?
 She may have died . " She may have died " ? We 're Iooking into it .

 I 'II go see .
 This almost never happens .
 Now she 's passed .
 I just have to know , okay ?
 Is it my hair ?
 Yes , that 's exactly what it is .
 It 's your hair . Yeah , you have homosexuaI hair .
 So did she . . . ?
 Twice .
 Oh , that sucks .
 You guys okay ?
 I don 't know .
 It 's weird . I know she 's gone , but I just don 't feel . . . .
 Maybe she 's not reaIly gone .
 No , no , she 's gone .
 We checked .
 A Iot .
 No , I mean , maybe no one ever reaIly goes .
 Ever since my mom died , every now and then . . . . . . I get this feeling that she 's , Iike , right here , you know ?
 And Debbie , my best friend from junior high . . . . . . got struck by Iightning on a miniature golf course .
 I always get this strong Debbie vibe . . . . . . whenever I use a Iittle yeIlow pencil .
 I miss her .
 Here , Pheebs . Want this ?
 - Oh , thanks . - Sure . I just sharpened her this morning .
 I don 't believe any of that .
 I think when you 're dead . . . . . . you 're dead .
 You 're gone . You 're worm food .
 So Chandler Iooks gay , huh ?
 I don 't know who this is , but it 's not Debbie .
 I thought it 'd be a closed casket .
 WeIl , that doesn 't mean she can 't Iook nice .
 Sweetie , you think you can get in there ?
 I don 't see why not .
 Here 's my retainer !
 I was just thinking . . . - . . . when my time comes -- - Dad !
 Listen to me !
 When my time comes , I wanna be buried at sea .
 You what ?
 I wanna be buried at sea .
 It Iooks Iike fun .
 Define " fun . "
 Come on . You 'II make a day of it .
 You 'II get a boat , pack a Iunch . . . .
 And then we throw your body in the water .
 Gee , that does sound fun . Everyone thinks they know me .
 Everyone says , " Jack GeIler , so predictable . "
 Maybe after I 'm gone , they 'II say , " Buried at sea ?
 Huh . " That 's probably what they 'II say .
 I 'd Iike that .
 Hey , gorgeous .
 Look , I 'm sorry about yesterday .
 Don 't worry about it . Apparently , other people have made the same mistake .
 Okay .
 Phew !
 So what do you think it is about me ? I don 't know what .
 You just have . . . - . . . a quality . Great .
 - A quality .
 It 's a shame , because you and LoweII would 've made a great couple .
 LoweIl ? FinanciaI Services LoweIl ?
 That 's who you saw me with ?
 What ? He 's cute .
 WeIl , yeah .
 He 's no Brian in PayroIl .
 Is Brian . . . ? I don 't know .
 The point is , if you were gonna set me up . . . . . . I 'd Iike to think it 'd be with somebody Iike him .
 I think Brian 's a Iittle out of your Ieague .
 Excuse me .
 You don 't think I could get a Brian ?
 Because I could get a Brian .
 Believe you me .
 I 'm reaIly not .
 This one ?

 I 've shown you every dress we have .
 Unless you want her to spend eternity in a Iemon- yeIlow pantsuit . . . . . . go with the burgundy .
 Whatever we pick , she would 've told us it 's the wrong one .
 You 're right . We 'II go with the burgundy .
 A fine choice . I 'm coming out .
 Wait ! We need shoes .
 How about these ?
 That 's reaIly a day shoe .
 And where she 's going , everyone else wiII be dressier ?
 Could we see something in a slimmer heel ?
 I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy .
 I can show you something in a silver that may work .
 No , it reaIly should be burgundy .
 Unless we go with a different dress .
 No , no , no . Watch this .
 Wait , I may have something in the back .
 Oh , my God .
 Is everything aII right ?
 Just Nana 's stuff .
 How we doing ?
 You guys ready ? Mom caIled to remind me not to wear my hair up .
 Did you know my ears were not my best feature ?
 Some days it 's aII I can think about .
 Hi ! I 'm sorry I 'm Iate .
 I couldn 't find my bearings .
 You mean your earrings ?
 What did I say ?
 - Are these the shoes ?
 - Yes . Paolo sent them from Italy .
 What ? We don 't have shoes here ?
 Morning .

 Nothing .
 Just your overcoat sounds remarkably Iike Brent Musburger .
 Check it out .
 Giants- Cowboys .
 You 're watching footbaII at a funeral ?
 No , it 's the pregame .
 I 'm gonna watch it at the reception .
 You 're a frightening , frightening man .
 Oh , no ! My new Paolo shoes !
 I hope they 're not ruined .

 God , what a great day !
 What ?
 Weatherwise .
 I know . The air , the trees .
 Even though Nana 's gone , there 's something almost Iife --
 Ross , are you okay ?
 No , I 'm fine .
 Just . . . . . . having my worst fear realized , but . . . .
 I 'm just checking to see if the muscle 's in spasm .
 - What ?
 What is it ? - You missed a belt Ioop .
 Okay , it 's in spasm .

 And Iisten , if you wanna be gay , be gay !
 It doesn 't matter to me .
 You were right .

 I love you the most .
 WeIl , you know who I love the most ?
 You !
 Oh , you don 't get it !
 What do you got there ?
 Just a hearing disability .
 What 's the score ?
 1 7- 1 4 , Giants .
 Three minutes to go in the third .
 Beautiful !
 Pheebs , could you maybe hand me a cracker ?
 Your grandmother would 've hated this .
 WeIl , sure . What with it being her funeraI and aIl .
 No , I 'd be hearing about . . . . . . why didn 't I get the honey- glazed ham .
 Or I didn 't spend enough on flowers .
 If I spent more , she 'd say . . . . . . " Why waste your money ?
 I don 't need flowers , I 'm dead . "
 That sounds Iike Nana .
 Do you know what it 's Iike to grow up . . . . . . with someone who is criticaI of every single thing you say ?
 I can imagine .
 I teII you , it 's a wonder your mother turned out . . . . . . to be the positive , Iife- affirming person she is .
 That is a wonder !
 So teII me something , Mom .
 If you had to do it aII over again . . . . . . I mean , if she was here right now . . . . . . would you teII her ?
 TeII her what ?
 How she drove you crazy , picking on every Iittle detail .
 Like your hair , for example .
 I 'm not sure I know what you 're getting at .
 Would things have been better if you 'd just told her the truth ?

 I think some things are better Ieft unsaid .
 I think it 's nicer when people just get along .
 More wine ?
 Oh , I think so .
 Those earrings Iook reaIly Iovely on you .
 Thank you . They 're yours .
 ActuaIly , they were Nana 's .
 Now I 'm depressed !
 Even more than I was .
 Hey , who 's this Iittle naked guy ?
 That Iittle naked guy would be me .
 Look at the Iittle thing !
 Yes , fine .
 That is my penis .
 Can we be grownups now ?
 Who are those people ?
 Got me .
 That 's Nana right there in the middle .
 Yeah , Iet 's see .
 " Me and the gang at Java Joe 's . "
 Monica , you Iook just Iike your grandmother .

 Twenty- four , twenty- five .

 Look , Iook , Iook ! I got Monica naked !
 Let me see !
 No , no .
 That would be me again .
 I 'm just trying something .
 Hey , LoweIl . Oh , hey , Chandler .

 So how 's it going in FinanciaI Services ?
 It 's Iike Mardi gras without the papier- mache heads .
 How about you ? Good .
 Good . Listen . . .

 . . . I 'm not .
 I know .
 That 's what I told her .
 ReaIly ?
 So you can teIl ?
 Pretty much . Most of the time .
 We have a kind of radar .
 So you don 't think I have . . . . . . a quality ?
 Speaking for my people , I 'd have to say no .
 By the way , your friend , Brian , from PayroIl ? He is .
 He is ?
 And way out of your Ieague .
 Out of my Ieague ! I could get a Brian .
 If I wanted to get a Brian , I could get a Brian .
 Hey , Brian .
