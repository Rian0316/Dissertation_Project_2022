 00 : 00 : 01, 601 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 935 No , seriously , I think I 've finally figured out my problem with women .
 The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family .
 What does that have to do with me and women ? It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation . Nothing .


 My problem is , I don 't project confidence .
 So I decided that the next time I meet a woman
 I think is attractive , rather than holding back and being cautious , I 'm going to assume the mantle of self- assurance .
 Oh , yeah ? What 's that look like ?


 Hi . I 'm Leonard .
 And you are beautiful .
 You pop , sparkle and buzz electric .
 I 'm going to pick you up at 8 : 00 , show you a night you will never forget .
 Where are we going ?

 Good news .
 I made it onto the team for the new Defense Department
 laser- equipped surveillance satellite .
 Excuse me .
 If we 're changing topics , I believe I have first dibs with capybara , a rodent the size of a baby hippo .
 Congratulations , Howard .
 Thanks .
 Listen , I have to get a security clearance , so you guys might be hearing from the FBl .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 I don 't want to speak to the FBl . Why not ?
 I 'm brown and I talk funny .
 They 're just doing a background check on me .
 It doesn 't matter ; they 'll find a reason to give me a one- way ticket back to Gandhi- ville .
 By the way , when I say that , it 's not offensive .
 Don 't be ridiculous , Raj .
 You 're here legally . Nobody cares .
 Do you know how long it 's been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy ?

 You know , I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative , but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn .

 Fine , Sheldon , tell us about your giant rodents .
 1No , you squandered your time with me , and the moment has now passed .
 Feast on your disappointment , much as the capybara feasts on its own waste .

 Oh , Bella , don 't you see ?
 Edward 's only pushing you away because he loves you .
 Coming .

 Dr. Koothrappali ?

 I 'm Special Agent Page , FBl . May I come in ?

 I 'd like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz .
 Oh , thank you . All right .
 Well , how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz ?

 Rum cake ? No , thanks .
 Now , about Mr. Wolowitz ...
 Seven years .
 I see .
 I 'm in this country legally , you know . I 'm sure you are .
 Now , to your knowledge , has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime ?
 Of course not .
 I 'm here on an H- 1B visa , which means I can 't be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity .
 And I 'm not .
 Good .
 To your knowledge , does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts ?
 No , just me .
 Oh , there it is .
 Here comes a cavity search . Excuse me ?
 Please don 't send me back to India ; it 's so crowded !
 It 's like the whole country is one endless Comic- Con , except everybody 's wearing the same costume :
 Indian Guy . Dr. Koothrappali , I 'm not ...

 I love this country !

 So , when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me ,
 I was expecting Mulder .
 Glad to see I got Scully . Who ?
 Mulder and Scully .

 " The truth is out there . "
 Never mind .
 Uh , so , what would you like to know ?
 You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university , correct ?
 Yes .
 Of course , we 're in different departments .
 He 's an engineer and I 'm an experimental physicist .
 You know , one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says , " Hello , maker of the universe .
 " I see what you did there .
 Good one . " Right .
 Now , how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz ?
 Good .
 It 's a good relationship .
 Of course , most of my relationships are good .
 Probably because I exude confidence .
 People are drawn to that , you know ?
 Confidence , not exuding .
 Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of ?
 You are beautiful , you know that ?
 You pop , sparkle and buzz electric .
 I 'm going to pick you up at 8 : 00 , show you a night you will never forget .
 Sounds great .
 Really ?
 Yeah .
 Can my six- foot- two Navy SEAL husband come with us ?
 Is that ... ?
 Oh , my , I didn 't see the ring with my glasses off , so ...
 Look at that , I 'm starting to exude .
 Want to get that ?
 Not particularly .
 Could you get that ?
 I suppose I could if I were asked .
 Would you please get that ?
 Of course .
 Why do you have to make things so complicated ?
 Dr. Cooper ?
 Yes .
 I 'm Special Agent Page , FBl .
 You you 're Special Agent Page , FBl .
 Here 's my I. D.
 And here is my Justice League membership card .
 But that doesn 't prove I know Batman .
 I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz .
 Oh .
 All right .
 I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex .


 Thank you .
 For the record , I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto ... ?
 Fidelity , bravery , integrity .
 Correct .
 Now to business .
 18 years ago , I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch ... ... for fingerprinting and DNA analysis .
 Why haven 't I heard back yet ?
 Well , the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate .
 That 's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes .
 Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now ?
 A little , but go on .
 Thank you .
 Would you characterize him as responsible ?
 I 'm going to answer that with a visual aid .
 This is my nine- disc complete
 trilogy Blu- ray set .
 Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it , damaged plastic retention hub number three ...
 ... and then returned it to me , hoping I wouldn 't notice .
 Would you characterize that as responsible ?
 That 's really not the sort of thing we 're interested in .
 You heard me say Blu- ray , right ? I did .
 Very well .
 Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level- 80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor ?


 I 'm afraid not .
 Is there anything else ?
 " Is there anything else ? "
 Where would you like to start ?
 He refuses to pay fines when he 's overdue with books I lend him .
 He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman .
 He recommended that I go see the third movie because it was , and I quote ,
 " just as good as the first one . "
 If that 's not irresponsible , I don 't know what is .
 The Mars Rover ?
 Did I say Mars Rover ? You did .
 That was actually a poorly chosen example , as it had nothing to do with me .
 Yes , well , let 's talk about it anyway .
 I don 't want to .
 Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz 's culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars .
 Thank you , Dr. Cooper .
 I think I have all I need .
 Oh , good .
 I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident .

 Hey , buddies .
 Guess who didn 't get security clearance to work on the giant space laser ?
 What happened ?
 Apparently , the background interviews didn 't go well .
 You guys wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ?
 Well , actually , I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her .
 And I may have hit on her a little bit .
 I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes .
 I see .
 Well , it 's good to know , when I need you guys , I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything .
 I feel awful .
 Ah , me , too . To tell you the truth ,
 I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard , it 'd be Sheldon .
 Well , your expectations have been subverted .
 Aha .
 What are you doing up ?
 Sleep eludes me , Leonard . Really ?
 Maybe sleep has met you before .
 Mockery ?
 That 's all you have to offer ? I 'm sorry .
 Why can 't you sleep ?
 Who knows ?
 I haven 't watched any scary movies recently .
 I 'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe .
 And it 's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull .
 Did something happen today that 's bothering you ?
 Well , I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance .
 What ?
 But why should that keep me up ?
 Because you feel guilty ? Interesting .
 So you 're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience .
 Actually , you don 't have insomnia . You 're sleeping now .
 Excuse me ?
 You 're having a guilt- ridden dream .
 Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
 How about that Gorn sitting on the couch ?
 That seems fairly conclusive .
 No , Gorn , no .
 That 's where I sit .
 Thank you for agreeing to see me , Agent Page .
 Thank for filing a complaint with my superior , Dr. Cooper .
 I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz .
 Yes .
 Was your statement untrue ?
 No .
 Then I 'm afraid you can 't withdraw it .
 I 'm sorry .
 I don 't recall you saying " no backsies . "
 Is there anything else ? Yes .

 I 'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard 's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favor .
 " Howard Joel Wolowitz .
 " H is for honesty , of which he has much .
 " O 's for outstanding , " which he is such .
 " W 's for witty , he 's quick with a joke .
 A 's for artistic , his ability ... " I 'm sorry .
 Dr. Cooper , this matter is already closed .
 But I still have " rd Joel Wolowitz " left to go . It 's closed .

 I don 't understand why you people are picking on my friend , Howard , when there are much more serious security threats to pursue .
 For instance , when I first met Leonard , he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy , and not one agent ever investigated that .
 This is Leonard Hofstadter ?
 No , it 's a different Leonard . He 's ...
 Chinese , red hair , six fingers .
 Good- bye .

 Raj . Have you seen Howard ?
 I think he 's eating lunch .
 Uh , Sheldon , I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York .
 I 'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson .
 He 's responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status .
 I liked Pluto .
 Ergo I do not like you .
 But I actually didn 't demote Pluto .
 That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union .
 If " ifs " and " buts " were candy and nuts , we 'd all have a merry Christmas .
 Think about that , Dr. Tyson .
 Is that the guy you were telling me about ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Howard .
 The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me . You ?
 Yes , but before you get upset , I want you to know
 I went to the FBI and retracted my statement . And they were okay with that ?
 No .
 If anything , I made it worse .
 In any case , I have been riddled with guilt , which is causing Gorn- infested REM sleep .
 So , I 'm here now to say I 'm sorry . Are you kidding me ?
 You 've set my career back at least two years , and you think you can make it right with " I 'm sorry " ?
 Yes .
 I followed the social protocol .
 I attempted to right the wrong , and when I failed to do so ,
 I delivered a heartfelt apology . Now you say ,
 " Apology accepted , " and I will offer you a one- time- only high five .
 Your apology is not accepted . You 're tricking me .
 It really is , isn 't it ?
 Leave me alone , Sheldon .

 Dr. Cooper , I just wanted you to know
 I 'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter . Oh , shut up .

 Sheldon ?
 Hello . What are you doing here ?
 I have troubles , Penny .
 I 've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep .
 You know , they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden .
 I don 't like the Olive Garden .
 They treat me like family .
 Okay , Sheldon .
 What can I get you ?
 Alcohol .
 Could you be a little more specific ?
 Ethyl alcohol . 40 milliliters .
 I 'm sorry , honey .
 I don 't know milliliters .
 Ah .
 Blame President James " Jimmy " Carter .
 He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up .
 He wonders why he was a one- term president .
 Would you say that 's about 40 milliliters ? More or less .
 Great .

 Now , where were we ?
 I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail .
 Fortunately , thanks to computer- savvy alcoholics , there 's an app for that .
 Let 's see . Harvey Wallbanger .
 Eh .
 Sex on the Beach .
 I hardly think so .
 Rob Roy ,
 Silk Slipper , Mad Hatter . Ooh !
 I 'll have a Rosewater Ricky . You 'll need pitted , brandied cherries , gin , rosewater , A what ?

 Angostura bitters and overproofed rum .
 Now , first , dust the cherries with sugar , then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters .
 Then ignite the rum , caramel ...
 Here you go -- one Rosewater Ricky . That 's not how it looks in the picture .
 Oh , yeah , you know , every bartender makes it differently .
 Why don 't you give it a try . All right .

 To the metric system .
 I can 't taste the cherries .
 All right .
 Sheldon , what 's on your mind ?
 I wronged Howard , and he won 't accept my apology .
 Oh , right , that . Yes , Leonard told me .
 Sorry , honey .
 Penny , you face failure on a daily basis .
 How do you cope ?
 I drink .
 To drinking .
 Nope .
 Oh , if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt .
 You know , sometimes stuff just happens , and there 's nothing you can do about it .
 For example , Lisa Peterson hasn 't talked to me since the 11th grade , because no matter how much you apologize , you can 't go back and un- dry- hump someone 's boyfriend .

 I see .
 You 're saying I 'm facing Starfleet Academy 's unwinnable command scenario : the Kobayashi Maru .
 Exactly . Sometimes you can 't win .
 Captain Kirk won .
 Kirk cheated .
 Impressive that you know that . It 's hard to believe
 I 'm actually having this conversation with you . Right there with you .
 Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator .
 That 's it .
 What ?
 I 'll reprogram Howard .
 What ... ?
 Sheldon , you can 't reprogram people .
 No , can 't reprogram people .
 To James Tiberius Kirk .
 Hello , all . - Hello .
 - Hey . Howard , you 're feeling better about me today , aren 't you ? Not really .
 Yes , you are .
 I 'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns .
 Oh .
 Go away , Sheldon .
 There 's a $9 . 95 e- book down the drain . What 's in the bag ?
 It 's for Howard .
 Oh .
 Sheldon , you can 't fix this with gifts .
 Nevertheless , I 've hurt you , and whether you forgive me or not ,
 I want you to have this .
 You 're giving me a couch cushion ? No .
 The cushion is merely symbolic .
 I 'm giving you my spot on the couch .
 But you love that spot . No .
 I love my mother .
 My feelings for my spot are much greater .
 It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe .
 And now it 's yours . Oh , my God , dude .
 Now you have to forgive him .
 All right .
 Apology accepted . High five .
 Not too hard .
 Thank you .
 I haven 't cried like this since
 I got to tell you ,
 Sheldon , I understand why you chose this spot .
 I mean , the temperature is good , but there 's no draft .
 I can see the television , but I can still talk to ...
 I changed my mind .
 Get out of my spot .
 How long ?
 94 seconds .
