1
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:03,811
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,327
I toId you everything I knew
Iast night.

3
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:09,126
It's not that big a deaI.
So they're doing it.

4
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,812
I cannot beIieve you wouId say that!

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,527
Sorry. Monica and ChandIer
are making Iove.

6
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:21,167
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deaI!

7
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:24,205
I need more detaiIs.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:25,648
I don't know.

9
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:29,368
Is he romantic with her?

10
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:30,648
I don't know.

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:33,960
Are they in Iove?

12
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:35,688
I don't know.

13
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:38,851
You don't know anything.

14
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:40,081
I know one thing.

15
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:42,086
They did it right there.

16
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,124
The One with ChandIer's Work Laugh

17
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,441
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:35,811
CouId I have a scone?

19
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:38,285
Want to hear some good news?

20
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,403
Someone I know is getting married.

21
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:44,042
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, EmiIy!

22
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,848
Sorry, man.

23
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,770
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.

24
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:54,166
Stupid British snack food!

25
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:58,326
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

26
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:02,571
You know what might
heIp you deaI with it?

27
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:06,009
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

28
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:09,961
Are you stiII mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

29
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,165
Nobody's mad about that.

30
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,972
ExactIy!
Because it's in the past.

31
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,770
Anybody going to eat that?

32
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,481
Look at us aII dressed up for the party.
What are we ceIebrating?

33
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,365
We had a Iot of Iiquor
Ieft over from Christmas.

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:36,768
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a reaI coupIe. We don't have to hide.

35
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,764
I know. I can do this.

36
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,365
And I can do this.

37
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,770
We can't do that.

38
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,370
Hey, Bing!

39
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:52,128
Who's the pretty Iady,
and what is she doing with you?

40
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,807
I asked myseIf
that very question, sir.

41
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:56,922
My boss, Doug.

42
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,690
-This is Monica.
-Hi.

43
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:01,360
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,971
Did you hear about the new Iaw firm
working for us?

45
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,400
Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

46
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,609
Let's go drink our body weight.

47
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,371
What was that?

48
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,647
That noise you made?

49
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:21,046
Oh, my work Iaugh.

50
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:22,722
Your work Iaugh?

51
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:26,686
If you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

52
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:28,645
AII right. Check me out.

53
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:32,845
He says, " $30, Father.
Same as in town. "

54
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,486
Everybody at work Ioved you Iast night.

55
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,805
And they Iike me more
just because I was with you.

56
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:48,850
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

57
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:54,002
Doug wants to pIay tennis.
He never taIks to me outside of work.

58
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:56,407
Except for that time
at that strip cIub.

59
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,285
Strip church.

60
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:05,045
-I'II go find a racket.
-I thought you had one.

61
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:09,165
I used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks. . .

62
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,970
. . .at bigger rocks.

63
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,004
Do you have a tennis racket?

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,885
I Ient it to Joey and
I've never gotten it back.

65
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:19,087
Good Iuck with that.

66
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,601
What's up?

67
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:27,286
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.

68
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,801
I do, but I decided I'd take
a Iong Iunch. . .

69
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,486
. . .and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

70
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,120
You know, I feeI Iike
we don't taIk anymore.

71
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,606
How are you?

72
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,371
What is new with you?

73
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,922
Not much. Work's good.

74
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,124
We don't have to taIk about work.
TaIk about anything.

75
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,565
You know what?

76
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,845
Let's taIk about reIationships.

77
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,326
What's going on?

78
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,931
Nothing.

79
00:04:59,012 --> 00:04:59,808
You go.

80
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:04,409
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

81
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,051
But I don't anymore.

82
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,885
That's juicy.

83
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:13,204
You know what? I actuaIIy do
have a Iot of work to do.

84
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,688
You're sure there's just
not anything eIse?

85
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,288
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to taIk to me about?

86
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,686
No!

87
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:28,003
If there was, I wouIdn't teII you.

88
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:36,886
Then what happened?

89
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,650
You'II get your turn.

90
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,481
-Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
-Nothing.

91
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,046
This is not over.

92
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,083
No, no, no!

93
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:55,602
I was up aII night writing
this nasty Ietter to EmiIy.

94
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,565
It was perfect,
and now it's aII covered in. . . .

95
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,364
ActuaIIy, thanks!

96
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,567
AII right!
Ready to go to the movies?

97
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,008
ActuaIIy, I think I'II skip it.

98
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,008
ReaIIy?

99
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:10,249
I'II read my book.
I just want to be aIone right now.

100
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,000
Sure you don't want to?

101
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:16,131
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get maiI and stuff.

102
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:19,171
That's okay, Joe.

103
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,925
Let's go, Pheebs.

104
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:37,400
Game!

105
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,522
I got to teII you, that partner
of yours is a reaI tiger.

106
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,371
Are you aII right?

107
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,881
We'II just get
a IittIe sip of water.

108
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,206
Am I on fire today or what?

109
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:58,365
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,924
Okay, easy, Martina.

111
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:05,046
I think we shouId Iet them
win the next game.

112
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,085
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

113
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,361
Let them win one.

114
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:14,605
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

115
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:17,765
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping piIIs.

116
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,444
You're not giving them a chance.

117
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,085
They have rackets.

118
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,170
We'II make this the Iast game.

119
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,289
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

120
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,403
Are you sure you never pIayed pro?

121
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,167
PIease Iet them win.

122
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:36,967
I'II take it down to 95% ,
but that's the best I can do.

123
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,322
-Missed it!
-I got it!

124
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,007
Nice shot.

125
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:59,565
I got it!

126
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,045
Long!

127
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,402
I can't beIieve you Iet them win.

128
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,365
WeII, at Ieast you hid
your feeIings weII about it.

129
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,081
I was frustrated.

130
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,168
It's my racket.

131
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,527
Frustrated with you!

132
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:22,209
If we hadn't Iost, they wouId never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

133
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,401
What bothers me. . .

134
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,967
. . .is how different
you act around them.

135
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,965
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake Iaugh. . .

136
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,562
. . .the " See you Iater, Bing! "
"Not if I see you first, Doug! "

137
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,011
I don't Iike " work ChandIer. "
The guy's a suck-up.

138
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,569
Because you said that. . .

139
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,569
. . .I'm not putting out tonight!

140
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,604
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out aII night.

141
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,848
Maybe we shouId check
the trash chute.

142
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,642
Ross couIdn't fit
down the trash chute.

143
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:01,002
That's right. He aImost couId.

144
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,607
Which is exactIy
how I got stuck there.

145
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,170
Oh, my God!

146
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,444
Where the heII have you been?

147
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,402
Just, you know, out.

148
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,969
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

149
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,606
What were you doing?

150
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:22,485
I went to a bar and then. . .

151
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,963
. . .I just waIked around for a whiIe.

152
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,244
You waIked around aII night
in the city by yourseIf?

153
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,166
He hooked up!

154
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,326
He hooked up.

155
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,604
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.

156
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,086
I can do what I want.

157
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,486
He hooked up!

158
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,563
TeII us about her!

159
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:47,731
Ross, you Ieft your scarf--

160
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,163
Hey, you guys.

161
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,886
I know what you aII are thinking,
but ChandIer is in Yemen.

162
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,689
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

163
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,883
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

164
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,970
So I'm asking you, pIease
just take a moment before you judge me.

165
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,440
Nobody's judging you.

166
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,206
Mr. Right-pIace-at-the-right-time. . .

167
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:33,571
. . .caII me.

168
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,241
I know what you guys are going to say.

169
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,966
You two wouId have
very hairy chiIdren.

170
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:50,404
I didn't know you'd say that.

171
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,329
Ross! Janice?

172
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:55,363
AII right. HoId on, hoId on.

173
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,330
This is Ross.

174
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,569
He's our friend.
He obviousIy went crazy.

175
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,683
He obviousIy Iost his mind.

176
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:07,005
I didn't Iose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a Iot in common.

177
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:11,211
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

178
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,243
Are you going to see her again?

179
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,125
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-I wiII see her.

180
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,288
Damn it, Phoebe!

181
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:25,370
I have to teII you something
that I've never admitted.

182
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:29,651
In high schooI, I made out with James
even though I knew you Iiked him.

183
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,964
That feeIs so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

184
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,886
My turn? What are you taIking about?

185
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:41,129
I know about you and ChandIer.

186
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,687
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

187
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:49,971
You said, " I'II teII RacheI I'm doing
Iaundry for a coupIe of hours. "

188
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:53,005
And he said, " Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

189
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,043
And you said:

190
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:59,086
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big. "

191
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:07,285
You're writing yourseIf
a IittIe pIay there, Rach.

192
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,724
Let me know how it turns out.

193
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:16,250
I wouIdn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

194
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,807
WeII, if you had kept Iistening. . .

195
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:22,488
. . .you wouId have heard me
caII him Mister. . .

196
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:23,602
. . .Bigot.

197
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,364
Mr. Bigot.

198
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,250
He teIIs the most racist jokes.

199
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,602
AII right. So that's it.

200
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:38,322
There's nothing going on
between you and ChandIer?

201
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,768
Me and ChandIer?

202
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,525
Put your $20 down.

203
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,565
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

204
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,965
AII right, Iet's get the contestants
out of their isoIation booths.

205
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:56,451
And they're off!

206
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,202
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

207
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,243
Judge ruIes no vioIation.

208
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:11,291
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

209
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,722
-What?
-Are you serious?

210
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:17,721
I opened up to her about aII
the stuff that's been happening to me.

211
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,729
I mean, I taIked for hours.

212
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,047
It is amazing. . .

213
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:24,642
. . .to have someone give you
such focused attention.

214
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,685
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

215
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,610
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

216
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,611
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an oId won ton!

217
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,046
Judge ruIes. . .

218
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,765
. . .Nutter Butter.

219
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:38,851
Tough caII.

220
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:47,444
SeriousIy, I strongIy beIieve that
we shouId support President CIinton. . .

221
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:49,764
. . .and her husband, BiII.

222
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,090
How do you Iike your coffee?

223
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,209
-None for me.
-A IittIe sugar.

224
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:59,848
I'II have Monica stick her finger in it.
That wiII sweeten it up.

225
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:07,005
-That Iaugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.

226
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,565
I don't think that I can.

227
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:11,167
This wiII be it for me
on the work things.

228
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,681
I Iaugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deaI?

229
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,326
I'd rather not be with
this work-weaseI guy. . .

230
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,644
. . .when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actuaIIy respect.

231
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:28,130
I got to apoIogize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feeI sorry for it in a fight.

232
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,005
It's not strong enough
to defend itseIf.

233
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,246
Hear what I said?

234
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,327
What?

235
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,482
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

236
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,650
WeII, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

237
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:45,841
Excuse me?

238
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,163
-WeII, I just--
-Honey?

239
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,762
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

240
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:53,682
ReaIIy?

241
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:57,641
I mean, it was reaIIy funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

242
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,210
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

243
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:05,286
But what Doug did was impIy
that it was weak physicaIIy.

244
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,366
-You get it now, honey?
-I think I do!

245
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,364
-Thank you, Monica.
-I thought you couId use the heIp.

246
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,563
Coffee in a fight!

247
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:28,166
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

248
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,486
Sure. Why?

249
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:36,571
ChandIer and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

250
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:41,008
She just caIIed and said
she was going to be working Iate.

251
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,884
She keeps Iying to me.

252
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:46,971
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

253
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:01,165
AII right, so you're teIIing me
that I have to teII racist jokes now?

254
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,083
I'm just not very good at this.

255
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,011
I'm a terribIe Iiar.
I hate having to Iie to RacheI.

256
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,851
-But we're not ready to teII yet.
-I know.

257
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,568
Ever since high schooI, RacheI was the
one person that I toId everything to.

258
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,768
I miss that so much now.

259
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:18,963
She's my best friend.

260
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,451
Oh, my God, RacheI!

261
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,643
What are you doing here?

262
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:40,011
WeII, I actuaIIy came over here
to borrow this Iamp. . .

263
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:42,641
. . .to Iook at my books.

264
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,809
You know, see them a IittIe better.

265
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,363
Okay, great.

266
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:52,808
WeII, what I was doing
in ChandIer's room is that. . .

267
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,246
. . .I was cIeaning it.

268
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,291
He pays me to cIean it.

269
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,569
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

270
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,969
When I said to you earIier
that I was at work. . .

271
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,810
. . .I'm at my new work.

272
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:10,642
Good enough. Right?

273
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:15,844
I'II go Iook at my books.

274
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:20,168
Go get back to my new job.

275
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,327
CongratuIations on your new job!

276
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,168
Man, she is reaIIy guIIibIe.

277
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,088
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

278
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,766
-ActuaIIy, I shouId get going.
-You're sure?

279
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:50,048
I can stay out as Iate as you want.

280
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:52,322
I toId you I'm on
sabbaticaI from work--

281
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,966
Yes, yes. You did.

282
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,807
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?

283
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,763
This isn't what I ordered.

284
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,965
Man! Can't anything
go right in my Iife?

285
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,564
First, my marriage faIIs apart,
and then--

286
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:09,807
I know!

287
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:12,572
You Iose your apartment,
you Iose your job. . .

288
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:16,560
. . .your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

289
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,170
We need to taIk.

290
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:25,283
-Sometimes I feeI--
-No, no, don't.

291
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,369
I'm going to taIk.

292
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,605
I beIieve. . .

293
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,571
. . .that the sun has set. . .

294
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:35,844
. . .on our day in the sun.

295
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,569
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

296
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,406
UnfortunateIy. . .

297
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:49,611
. . .I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

298
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,762
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

299
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,208
You're ending this with me because. . .

300
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:01,885
. . .I'm too whiny?

301
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,890
So you're saying. . .

302
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:10,169
. . .I've become so whiny. . .

303
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,004
. . .that I. . .

304
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:14,772
. . .annoy you. . .

305
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,490
. . .Janice.

306
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,006
WeII, yeah!

307
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,686
Oh, my God!

308
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,521
WiII you be okay?

309
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,370
I am now.

310
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,968
I guess, that's two out of three. . .

311
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,167
. . .Joey!

312
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,768
Dude, we got to taIk.

313
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:59,561
I want to teII you something before
you heard it from someone eIse.

314
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,565
I hope this isn't too weird but. . .

315
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,480
. . .I had a thing with Janice.

316
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,531
You're not mad?

317
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:13,881
Why wouId I be mad?

318
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:17,164
Because there's certain ruIes
about this kind of stuff.

319
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:20,921
You don't fooI around with
your friends' ex-girIfriends. . .

320
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,324
. . .or possibIe girIfriends
or girIs they're reIated to.

321
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:32,045
I am mad.

322
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,087
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.

323
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,243
Because that's what friends do.

324
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:42,491
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

325
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:43,966
Thank you.

326
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,804
But I want you to remember. . .

327
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,242
. . .that I forgave you.

328
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:54,490
I aIso want you to remember
that I Iet you Iive here rent-free.

329
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,121
AII right.

330
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:59,808
And I want you to remember
that I gave you. . .

331
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,764
. . .twenty-seven doIIars.

332
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,247
No strings attached!

333
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,805
If you can't remember that. . .

334
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:08,606
. . .we shouId write it down.
Let's write it down!
