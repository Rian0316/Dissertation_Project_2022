1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:04,802
嘿 我前两天看了个电影预告片
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day.

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:07,213
蝙蝠侠怎么可能跟超人大战呢?
How could Batman possibly fight Superman?

3
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:08,746
我是说 这也太傻了吧?
I mean, isn't that dumb?

4
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,048
或许他用了氪星石
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050
蝙蝠侠多金啊
Well, Batman's got a lot of money.

6
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:15,019
或许他造了一件媲美超人一切能力的战衣
Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:16,354
不 不 此言差矣
No, no, no, no, no.

8
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,289
我看过那部电影 叫钢铁侠
I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.

9
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,866
什么情况?
What is happening?

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,368
母鸡啊
I don't know.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,871
太和谐了
But it's beautiful.

12
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:35,974
现在本·阿弗莱克都能演蝙蝠侠了?
And now Ben Affleck is Batman?

13
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:38,176
他在莎翁情史中表现很棒
Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.

14
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,178
哦 那我们下次闺蜜之夜看这部电影
Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,379
我们可以来个双片放映
We could do a double feature

16
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,947
加上莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥版的罗密欧和朱丽叶
with the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet.

17
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,716
好 我想看莱昂
Oh, I love me some Leo.

18
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,384
转瞬即逝啊
And it's gone.

19
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,320
大家好
Oh, hello, everyone.

20
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,257
我非常开心地宣布我感觉好多了
I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,658
恭喜你啊
Good for you.

22
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,662
我发烧退了 我的鼻子不堵了
My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free,

23
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:01,165
我的痰也像优胜美地瀑布一样清澈了
and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.

24
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,669
喜闻乐见啊
Glad to hear it.

25
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,540
我明天就可以回去工作了
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.

26
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,943
耶
Yay.

27
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,412
你们怎么都不开心呢?
Well, why isn't everyone happy?

28
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:18,149
你们的小小阳光可以再次闪耀了
Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.

29
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:21,052
- 你真不知道原因?  - 不知道
- You really don't know why?  - No.

30
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,988
但我知道他的"耶"是反话
But I knew that his “yay” was sarcastic.

31
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,090
我这洞察力对一个拉肚子拉的跟下雨一样的
Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement

32
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,259
人来说已经不错了
sounded like rain on a roof.

33
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,931
让我帮你回顾一下
Let me refresh your memory.

34
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,966
Penny啊
Penny,

35
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,802
帮我在胸上抹药膏
rub Vicks on my chest.

36
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,605
Sheldon 我帮你做了早饭
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.

37
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:42,040
我给你铺了床
I made your bed.

38
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,942
我查了你的嘴巴看有没有长疮
I checked your mouth for thrush.

39
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,878
你可以自己抹胸口的
You can rub your own chest.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,480
好吧 对星球上所有的男性毛手毛脚
Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet,

41
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,082
但偏偏对我划清界限
but draw the line with me.

42
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:55,420
我从公司给你带了爱的包裹
I brought you a little care package from work.

43
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:56,621
这是我们最新制作的抗病毒药
It's our latest antiviral

44
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,590
和最棒的鼻塞药
and the best decongestant we make.

45
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,292
我希望笑是最好的良药
I hope laughter is the best medicine,

46
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:04,128
因为爱的包裹根本就是笑话
'cause this care package is a joke.

47
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,965
嘿 她不辞辛苦...
Hey, she came all the way here...

48
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,273
你最好跟食物一起服用
You're gonna want to take these with food.

49
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:19,577
Sheldon 别像个孩子似的
Sheldon, stop being a baby

50
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,579
让Emily给你瞧瞧
and let Emily take a look at you.

51
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,615
她是个皮肤科医生
She's a dermatologist.

52
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,583
我读过医学系
I went to medical school.

53
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,485
这样的话 拜托你
Well, in that case, try removing

54
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,320
把站在你旁边的那坨
the irritating patch of brown skin

55
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,022
烦人的棕色皮肤移除掉
standing next to you.

56
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,028
好了 给你
All right, here you go.

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,163
Leonard 我要死了
Leonard, I'm dying.

58
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:41,666
你不会死 只是流感而已
You're not dying. It's just the flu.

59
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,001
我想吃鸡汤面
I asked for chicken noodle.

60
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:46,104
但我却看到了鸡肉星星汤 折磨死我了
This is chicken and stars. It's killing me.

61
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:52,010
那根本就不是鸡汤面 我说错了吗?
I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?

62
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,648
# 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 #
# Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state #

63
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,984
# 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! #
# Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! #

64
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:01,619
# 地球开始降温 #
# The Earth began to cool #

65
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:04,155
# 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 #
# The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools #

66
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,824
# 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 #
# We built the Wall # # We built the pyramids #

67
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,494
# 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 #
# Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery #

68
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,396
# 一切由大爆炸开始 #
# That all started with a big bang #

69
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,664

00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,736
嗨 Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

74
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,738
嗨
Hello.

75
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,540
你感觉好些了吗?
Are you feeling any better?

76
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,709
肉体上 是的 但我因为大家
Physically, yes, but I'm upset

77
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,279
没理由地生我气感到失落
because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.

78
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,315
你可以试试用一种温柔贴心的方法
Why don't you tell me what happened,

79
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,151
告诉我发生的一切
and in a gentle, loving way,

80
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:41,220
我会给你解释你哪里做的不对
I'll explain to you why you're wrong.

81
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,723
你知道吗 当你生病时
You know how, when you're sick,

82
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,826
你可以耍脾气并说出你想要的一切
you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want

83
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,829
而不需要顾及别人的感觉?
and other people's feelings don't matter?

84
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,801
哦 要温柔贴心 这看来会很难了
Ooh. Gentle and loving. This is gonna be tricky.

85
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,736
我高烧38度
I had a 101 fever.

86
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:01,073
如果这我都不能指使我朋友 那该是什么时候?
If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?

87
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:06,512
Sheldon 当你生病时 你是有点令人... 无法忍受
Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be... unbearable.

88
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,748
这就是为什么你的朋友们
That's why your friends have been known

89
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,485
加班或者偷偷去看电影
to work late or sneak out to the movies

90
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,087
或者在神经学研讨会结束三天后
or stay at a neurobiology conference

91
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,690
还待在那里
three days after it's ended.

92
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:21,360
你在密歇根州待了一个星期就为了不在我身边?
You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?

93
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,196
不 不 不光是这个
No, no, not just that.

94
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,497
我是说...
I mean...

95
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:27,400
底特律下雨夹雪时特别漂亮
Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.

96
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,102
知道吗 我不是唯一一个
You know, I'm not the only one

97
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,637
在生病时感觉不开心的人
who's unpleasant when they're sick.

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,340
当Penny食物中毒时 她呕吐声音特别大
When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly

99
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,076
我都听不见电视声
I could barely hear the television.

100
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,479
哦 外面有点动静
Ooh, I just heard something.

101
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,847
可能是冰雹 可能是枪声
Might be hail, might be gunfire.

102
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,616
不管是啥我都要去拍照 拜拜
Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.

103
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,119
嘿 Stuart
Hey, Stuart.

104
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,055
嘿 Sheldon呢?
Hey. Where's Sheldon?

105
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,156
- 还生病吗?  - 没 他很好
- Still sick?   - No, he's fine.

106
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,625
我们只是需要休息一会
We just needed a little break.

107
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,759
嗯 我知道了
Yeah, I get that.

108
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,628
当我把他的漫画给他时
When I brought him his comics the other day,

109
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,731
他说"太好了 死神真的上门了"
he said, "Oh, great, Death is literally at my door."

110
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,868
他对每个人都那么混蛋
He was being a jerk to everyone.

111
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,102
别往心里去
Don't take it personally.

112
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,204
哦 我吃了这么多抗抑郁药
Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants,

113
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:07,473
就算我想的话也不可能
I couldn't if I wanted to.

114
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,944
我希望我们能不带Sheldon做更多事
I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.

115
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,580
我一直都这么想
I wish that all the time.

116
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,951
一般是我吹灭生日蜡烛时候许的愿
Usually before I blow out birthday candles.

117
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,787
Amy也隔离了他一些时间
You know, Amy took some time off from him.

118
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,223
真的巩固了他们的感情
Really improved their relationship.

119
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,625
嗯 不错
Huh. Okay.

120
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:28,160
只要结局不是我们和他性交
As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him,

121
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,495
我都参加
I'm in.

122
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,765
我们应该去旅游或者干些别的
We should all take a trip or something.

123
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,467
知道吗 Penny和我一直在讨论
You know, Penny and I have been talking

124
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,801
在拉斯维加斯过周末
about taking a weekend in Vegas.

125
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,403
我们应该都去
Maybe we should all go.

126
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,138
Bernie会喜欢的
Bernie would love that.

127
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,373
哦! 哦! 我们还可以坐
Oh! Ooh! Maybe we could get

128
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,341
那些派对巴士去那里
one of those party buses to take us there.

129
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,643
听起来很有趣
That sounds really fun.

130
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:44,710
嗯 听起来不错
Yeah, that sounds fun.

131
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,312
一个派对永不停的派对巴士
A party-bus party don't stop.

132
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:49,215
哦! 我说"派对" 你说"巴士"
Ooh! When I say "party," you say "bus."

133
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:49,951
- 不  - 不
- No.  - No

134
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,951
- 不  - 不!
- No.  - No!

135
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,055
所以 我和大家在讨论
So, the guys and I were talking about

136
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,291
租一辆派对巴士然后所有人去拉斯维加斯
renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.

137
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:59,825
哦 这不错啊
Oh, that could be fun.

138
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,128
说清楚点 你说的派对巴士里面有
But just to be clear, you mean a party bus

139
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,462
酒和饮料
with booze and music, right,

140
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,898
而不是果汁盒还有电子游戏吧
not, like, juice boxes and video games?

141
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,333
对
Yes.

142
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,835
Howard的生日派对你把我送去就可以了
And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party.

143
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,471
你不需要留下来
You didn't have to stay.

144
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,773
好啊 加我一个
Well, I'm in.

去拉斯维加斯 但是...
Well, Vegas, but...

148
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,581
呃 像大西洋城一样还没有糖吃?
Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy?

149
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,115
算了吧
No, thank you.

150
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,452
没关系 其实我们没打算请你一起去
That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.

151
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,487
这... 这太伤人了
Well, now... well, that's hurtful.

152
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,623
Sheldon 你都不喜欢那地方
Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.

153
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,191
虽然我觉得那地方
I can consider a place

154
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,459
就是美国的便池
America's urinal cake

155
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,195
但是偶尔去去还是不错的啊
and still enjoy the occasional visit.

156
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,964
这次不行
Not this time.

157
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,499
好吧 我就和Wolowitz一起玩吧
Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.

158
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,102
- 他也去  - 那我就和Raj...
- He's coming, too.  - Well, then Raj and I will...

159
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,871
- 他也不行  - 好吧 那我和Stuart玩
- Nope.  - Very well. Stuart.

160
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,373
好啊 就他吧
Oh, great. Do that.

161
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,344
呃 Stuart
Ugh. Stuart.

162
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,513
Sheldon 有什么新鲜事吗?
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?

163
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,049
我们的朋友都是混蛋 宝宝很生气
Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.

164
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,919
我问的是"新鲜"事 不过算了吧
I said, “What's new?” but sure.

165
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,254
你能相信他们打算
Can you believe they planned a trip

166
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,223
抛下我去拉斯维加斯吗?
to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?

167
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,858
你是不是没有道歉
Did you refuse to apologize

168
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,260
还搞得好像他们生气是他们傻?
and act like they were stupid for being mad?

169
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,330
我还是喜欢以前
You know, I liked it better when there was still

170
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,599
我们之间还有秘密的时候
a little mystery left in our relationship.

171
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,435
所有人都在想办法照顾你
Everyone tried to take care of you,

172
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,571
但是你还是对他们那么刻薄
and you were nothing but mean to them.

173
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,406
你竟然不站在我这边
I can't believe you're not on my side.

174
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:24,677
你车子里的收音机被偷走的时候我可是站在你这边的
I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.

175
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,115
那个时候你不支持我支持谁啊?
Who else's side could you have been on?

176
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,217
我不知道
I don't know.

177
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,420
一个热爱音乐的痴心浪子?
A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?

178
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,556
Sheldon 我知道你很不高兴
Sheldon, I understand that you're upset

179
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,225
因为你感觉被排除在外了
because you feel left out,

180
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,761
但是我真不知道我们说那么多干嘛
but I don't know why we're even talking about this.

181
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,496
你去和他们道歉啊
Just apologize to them.

182
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:47,099
好吧 看来我要这样才能和他们一起出去玩了
Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.

183
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,269
你能不能真心实意地去道个歉啊
Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad.

184
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,337
这叫同情心
It's called empathy.

185
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,773
你应该好好学学
It's something you could work on.

186
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,508
我有同情心啊
I have empathy.

187
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,009
看着
Watch.

188
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,212
Leonard给我烧了汤 我还对他那么刻薄
Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

189
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,017
太好了
Great.

190
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,954
再说一遍 这次不要搞得好像你第一次当人
Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.

191
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,023
好吧
Fine.

192
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,627
Leonard给我烧了汤 我还对他那么刻薄
Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

193
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,796
嘿 我有点感觉了
Hey, I felt a little something.

194
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,164
让我再试试
Let me try again.

195
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,702
Leonard给我烧了汤 我还对他那么刻薄
Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

196
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,970
我的确对他很刻薄
I was mean to him.

197
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,373
他肯定很难过
He must have felt terrible.

198
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,376
现在我也很难过了
Oh, now I feel terrible.

199
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,778
真棒!
Neat!

200
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,281
很高兴能帮上忙
Glad I could help.

201
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,349
现在轮到你了 让我看看你
Now let me see you feel bad for lying

202
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,952
对我撒谎躲在底特律的事自责的样子
and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.

203
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:43,489
我真的好难过
I feel so, so bad.

204
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,459
嘿 我们真厉害
Hey, we're both great at this.

205
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:53,165
Leonard 准备好 我要道歉了
Leonard, get ready for an apology.

206
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,302
就好像奈特·沙马兰的电影结尾一样
And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie,

207
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,304
这次我是真心的
I'm going to mean it.

208
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,972
啊 就像其他我看过的
Ah, so like every other

209
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,540
奈特·沙马兰电影结尾一样
M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen,

210
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,243
你又剧透了
you spoil it in advance.

211
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,811
嘿 你不知道布鲁斯威利斯是个死人
Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis

212
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,681
可不是我的错
was dead the whole time, that's not on me.

213
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,284
好吧
Okay.

214
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,753
开始啦
Here it comes.

215
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,087
在我生病的时候
You tried to take care of me

216
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,356
你努力照顾我 而我却对你那么刻薄
when I was sick, and I was mean to you.

217
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,458
这种态度没有借口
There's no excuse for that.

218
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,660
而且我非常的抱歉
And I'm truly sorry.

219
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,662
谢谢
Thank you.

220
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,997
我很感激
I appreciate that.

221
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,066
我希望你知道这歉意是很真诚的
I want you to know that that is sincere.

222
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,334
我确实... 很后悔
I-I do feel bad.

223
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,536
我不是为了可以和你们一起去旅游才这么说的
I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.

224
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,738
同样也很感激
Appreciate that, too.

225
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,140
太棒了
Terrific.

226
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,142
现在只剩下你邀请我一起去了
Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come.

227
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,409
然后我问 "你确定吗?"
Me to ask, "Are you sure?"

228
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,577
你说 "当然"
You to say, "Absolutely."

229
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,678
然后我无奈地总结说
And then me to bring it home with,

230
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,414
"对你这张小脸我怎么能拒绝呢?"
"How could I say no to that face?"

231
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,050
你还是不能去
You're still not coming.

232
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,419
什么? 但是我真心诚意地道歉了啊
What? But I apologized and I meant it.

233
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,188
我知道我们很少玩这个游戏
I know that we don't play this game very often,

234
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,257
但是你玩错了
but you're doing it wrong.

235
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,026
Sheldon 我接受你的歉意 但是你生病的时候
Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset

236
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,327
惹得很多人都生气了
a lot of people while you were sick.

237
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,463
我没有权利说你可以来就能来啊
I'm not in a position to just say you can come.

238
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,665
好吧
Well, all right.

239
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,868
假如我和他们都道歉了呢?
What if I apologize to all of them?

240
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,804
好吧 假如你和所有人都道歉了
Fine, if you apologize to everyone,

241
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:07,006
他们说没问题了 那你就可以来了
they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.

242
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:08,474
接受挑战!
Challenge accepted!

243
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,610
听起来就像Sheldon Cooper的道歉之旅
Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.

244
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,214
我希望这次
Well, I hope it's as much fun

245
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,784
和Sheldon Cooper菜单拼写检查记一样好玩
as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.

246
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,452
天啊!
My goodness!

247
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,722
你还记得 "附送庐笋"吗?
Do you remember “comes with apsparagus”?

248
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,844
Howard和Bernadette
Howard and Bernadette,

249
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,846
你们在我生病的时候努力安抚我
you tried to comfort me when I was ill,

250
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:39,115
而我对你们的态度却很糟糕
and I treated you terribly.

251
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,717
对不起
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:43,686
我很感动
I'm impressed.

253
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,721
不不不 等等
No, no, no, wait.

254
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:45,789
我还没完
I'm not done.

255
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,924
请允许我用一场感天动地的表演
Allow me to underscore my sentiment

256
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,692
来强调一下我的歉意
with a haunting rendition

257
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:51,528
一首用排箫吹奏的
of Brenda Lee's "I'm Sorry"

258
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,696
布伦达·李的 "对不起"
played on the pan flute.

259
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,667
- 你的歉意我们接受了!  - 原谅你了 原谅了!
- Apology accepted!  - Forgiven, forgiven!

260
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:01,070
好吧 又浪费了八个小时的练习时间
All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain.

261
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,708
为了纪念这场道歉
And to memorialize this occasion,

262
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,611
这是你们的纪念T恤
here are your commemorative T-shirts.

"Sheldon Cooper apologized to me"

264
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:19,789
"他让大家和好如初"
"And he made it all better."

265
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,930
你付出了一切的
All you did was offer

266
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,065
细致关怀和悉心照顾
maternal care and affection,

267
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,967
而你收获的却是
and all you received in return

268
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:34,304
我粗鲁且无知的行为
was rude and insensitive behavior.

269
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,406
你能等等说吗?
Can this wait?

270
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,874
恐怕不行
I'm afraid it can't.

271
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,042
明天就出去旅游了
The trip is tomorrow.

272
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,844
我还有好多歉没道呢
And I have more apologies to make.

273
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:43,146
好吧 我接受了你的道歉 你给我出去!
Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out!

274
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:45,081
太棒了 你介意拿着这件T恤
Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt

275
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,317
- 给我拍张... ?  - Leonard!
- while I take a quick...?  - Leonard!

276
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,623
你在我难受的时候给我带来了漫画书
You brought me my comic books when I wasn't feeling well.

277
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
你真是考虑很周到
That-that was thoughtful.

278
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:56,793
而我却没有体会到你的周全
And I was insensitive.

279
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,228
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,829
谢谢 Sheldon
Thank you, Sheldon.

281

我很感激
I appreciate that.

282
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,133
我是真心诚意地道歉的 你知道吗?
And I want you to know that I mean it, you know?

283
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:08,204
这不只是因为我想去拉斯维加斯玩
This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.

284
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,177
去拉斯维加斯玩?
What trip to Las Vegas?

285
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,145
这周末每个人
The one everyone's taking

286
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:18,648
都坐派对巴士去玩
this weekend on the party bus.

287
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,084
当然了 没邀请我
Of course, I wasn't invited.

288
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:24,988
我可以理解
That would be my understanding.

289
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:27,924
说个不那么难受的事情
On a less painful subject,

290
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,959
你穿什么码子的T恤?
what size T-shirt do you take?

291
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:35,932
Raj 你一直都在当个好朋友
Raj, you were being a good friend,

292
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:39,602
生病不是我讨人嫌的理由
and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.

293
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,739
我希望你能接受我的歉意
I hope that you can accept my apology.

294
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,607
我不会在意的
Of course I do.

295
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,610
Emily 很抱歉我说皮肤科医生
And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists

296
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,546
不是真正的医生
aren't real doctors.

297
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:52,916
我相信你听过很多次都烦了
And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

298
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,021
你真的觉得我经常听人这么讲吗?
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?

299
00:12:58,023 --> 00:13:00,456
你的工作就是挤挤青春痘
Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits

300
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,792
往老妈妈的脸上打打肉毒杆菌...
and squirting Botox into old lady faces...

301
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,093
够了!
Okay!

302
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:06,796
够了 要说的是
Okay, the point is

303
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,032
我们接受你的歉意
that we accept your apology.

304
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,199
也许你接受歉意了
Uh, maybe you do.

305
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,001
可他又挖苦我了
He just insulted me again.

306
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,670
他不是故意的
Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.

307
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:15,338
你为什么护着他?
Why are you defending him?

308
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,573
我想我知道原因
I believe I can answer that.

309
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:17,740
和我一样
Uh, like me,

310
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,742
Raj是在表达同情心
Raj is demonstrating empathy.

311
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,011
何不接受我的歉意
Now, why don't you accept my apology,

312
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,781
并收下你的免费T恤...
receive your free T-shirt, uh...

313
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,783
我希望最小号就行了
I hope extra small is okay.

314
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,719
不知为何 Wolowitz拿了中号
For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.

315
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,389
我不接受你的歉意
Well, I don't accept your apology.

316
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,657
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

317
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,626
这叫做为自己说话
It's called standing up for myself.

318
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:37,760
有时候你也该试试
You should try it some time.

319
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,463
那不如这样吧?
Fine, how about this?

320
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,699
这无聊的争吵
You're making me uncomfortable by prolonging

321
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,901
让我觉得不舒服 我希望你别这样
this ridiculous fight, and I wish you'd stop.

322
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,536
你要我别这样?
Oh, you want me to stop?

323
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,570
没问题
No problem.

324
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,038
行了 别走啊!
No, come on, please don't leave!

325
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,941
确认一下 你还去玩吗?
Point of clarification-- are you still going on the trip?

326
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,109
因为如果不去的话...
Because if not...

327
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,078
别担心 你没事的
Don't worry, you're good.

328
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:00,416
我导致你们吵架 我很抱歉
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

329
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:03,486
等等 我可以再真诚一点...
Wait, I can do that better...

330
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,756
我导致你们吵架
I caused that fight.

331
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,124
我很抱歉
I feel terrible.

332
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,561
哇 我也不知道哪个更好
Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.

333
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:14,897
他俩吵得厉害吗?
So, was the fight really bad?

334
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,132
没有
No.

335
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,834
按吵架来说 吵得可精彩了
As a fight, it was excellent.

336
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:21,037
她说了难听的话 还摔了门
She used harsh language and slammed the door.

337
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,772
虽然我这么说
Although as I say this,

338
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,108
可也许不是你问的那个意思
that might not have been what you were asking.

339
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,844
你觉得他们还会去吗?
You think they'll still go on the trip?

340
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,946
我知道是吵架过后 我去安慰Emily...
All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth...

341
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,915
- 他们不会去玩了  - 不会去了
- They're not going on the trip.  - No.

342
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,452
你到底什么毛病?
What is wrong with you?

343
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:39,756
看看他 关心我的毛病
Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me.

344
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,425
这是顶级的换位思考
That is some top-shelf empathy.

345
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,763
我们该组建个学习小组
Hey, well, we should start a club.

346
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,432
你去向Emily道歉
You went to Emily's to apologize.

347
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,968
而你走后 她在哭
And when you left, she was crying.

348
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,336
是啊
That is true.

349
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,072
我想我该再道歉一次
Well, I suppose I should apologize again.

350
00:14:58,777 --> 00:14:59,909
她还好吗?
Is she okay?

351
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,878
还好 我安慰她了
Yeah, I calmed her down.

352
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,213
可如果Sheldon去拉斯维加斯的话她就不去了
But she's not going to Vegas if he's going.

353
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,149
等等 还有得选择?
Wait, that's an option?

354
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:09,419
我还以为没得选
I didn't know that was an option.

355
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:10,753
没事的 因为我已经决定
Well, that is fine, because I've decided

356
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,188
不和你们一块儿去了
that I won't be joining you.

357
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,424
我意识到表达我内疚心情的
I've realized that the most genuine way

358
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,693
最好方法就是让你们
to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you

359
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,961
这周末好好玩
have this weekend to yourselves.

360
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,632
你真是太成熟了
That's very mature of you.

361
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,567
我最近也小小地旅行了一回
Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently.

362
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,237
并不是去罪恶之城而是去真诚之城
Not to Sin City but to Sincere City.

363
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,974
带回来的不是尖锐湿疣
Where instead of genital warts, the only growth

364
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:35,011
而是心智的成长
you'll come back with is personal growth.

365
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,848
下一件T上面写这个吧
And there's your next T-shirt.

366
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,587
喔 瞧瞧这钢管
Ooh, check out the stripper pole.

367
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:45,988
你知道这意味着什么吗
You know what that means.

368
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,958
Raj在我们上高速之前就会缠在上面吗?
That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway?

369
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,593
真是太了解我了!
You know it!

370
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,565
真是太酷了
This is so cool.

371
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,966
喝点香槟吧!
Let's have champagne!

372
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,701
嗯嗯
Mm-hmm.

373
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:01,370
我要敬大家一杯
Well, I would like to propose a toast

374
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,872
庆祝这个属于我们的周末...
to a well-deserved weekend of...

375
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:09,312
你在做甚啊?!
What are you doing?!

376
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,948
我的计划是上国道再跳出来
My plan was to jump out at the state line,

377
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,485
但是我的一个鼻塞掉进马桶里了
but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.

378
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:19,088
你连一个周末都不愿意让我们好过吗?
You couldn't give us just one weekend?

379
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,624
我跟他说了这主意不好
I told him this was a bad idea.

380
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:26,395
我们怎么办 把他俩踢下去
What do we do-- kick them off?

381
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,964
如果我们在消防局把他俩丢下
If we drop them off at a fire station,

382
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,900
他们就得收留他俩 不能有任何异议
they have to take them; no questions asked.

383
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:34,971
在这之前 请允许我再跟
Before you do, please give me one more chance

384
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,973
Emily道歉一次
to apologize to Emily.

385
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,708
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

386
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,844
Emily 我很清楚你知道
Emily, as I'm sure you know,

387
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:44,747
我一直被当做一个怪咖
I'm considered an odd fellow.

388
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,618
但是你不知道的是 尽管我嘴上
But what you don't know is that, while I often

389
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,188
常常说错话 但是我内心深处是善良的
say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well.

390
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,090
我觉得你是一个
I think that you are

391
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:57,093
聪明又有魅力的女性
a smart and wonderful woman, you know?

392
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:00,730
我们都觉得Koothrappali是高攀了你
And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.

393
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,399
你懂得 Sheldon...
You know, Sheldon...

394
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:06,202
嘘 让他说完
Shh, let him finish.

395
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,171
所以 我要为我过去对你造成的冒犯
So, for all the times I've offended you

396
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:10,740
和未来可能会对你造成的冒犯
and all the times that I'll offend you in the future,

397
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,643
表示歉意
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,479
谢谢你
Thank you.

399
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,914
好的
Good.

400
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,016
我该走了
Then I'll be leaving now.

401
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:22,318
没事的 Sheldon
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon.

402
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,487
和我们一块儿去吧
Come with us.

403
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,789
哦 你真是太好了
Oh, that's very kind of you.

404
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,325
但是我觉得我不在你们都会玩得更开心
But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me.

405
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,827
走吧 stuart
Let's go, Stuart.

406
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,328
但是我不想走
But I want to stay.

407
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,663
Stuart 别磨叽!
Stuart, now!

408
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,471
我知道他挺二逼的
You know, I know he's a jerk,

409
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,173
但是我有点为他难过
but I actually feel bad for him.

410
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:48,110
你看到问题所在了吧
And now you see the problem.

411
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,683
快上来 你这熊孩子!
Come on, you pain in the ass!

412
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,051
说我呢!
That's me!

413
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,519
拜 Stuart
Bye, Stuart.

414
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,621
等等!
Wait!

415
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:02,058
我也是熊孩子啊!
I'm a pain in the ass, too!

416
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,627
和Raj能和好
Are you relieved that you and Raj

417
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,629
是不是让你舒了口气?
were able to patch things up?

418
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,163
现在吗?
At the moment?

419
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:18,165
不 并没有
No, not really.

420
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,600
# 燃烧吧 宝贝 燃烧... #
# Burn, baby, burn... #

421
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,369
摇摆吧 宝贝!
Shake it, baby!

422
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:24,171
摇起来!
Work that thing!
