1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,069
I have a special treat
for y'all today.

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,305
My dear friend and former
college roommate is here

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:07,873
from the Johnson Space Center

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,009
in Houston to talk to us
about our space program.

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,344
And yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,646
These guys were roomies.

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,914
How does one go on

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,684
to be a...
a fancy scientist at NASA,

9
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,786
and the other's teaching
freshman science

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,654
at a public high school?

11
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,656
Yeah, Sheldon.

12
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,291
I was thinking that.

13
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,660
Thank you.

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,397
All right, let's
give a warm welcome

15
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,933
to my good buddy,
Dr. Ronald Hodges.

16
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,202
Hey, kids. Hey.

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,772
Glad to be here.
And, Hubert, the answer

18
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:43,042
to your question is, one of
those roomies was busy studying

19
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,644
while the other was out
chasing high school girls.

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,081
Yeah.

21
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,350
To be clear, they
were all over 18.

22
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,818
Yeah. Well...

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,121
Now, what I thought would
be fun to talk about today

24
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,958
is what NASA's planning on doing
beyond the space shuttle.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,761
Things like the first
manned mission to Mars.

26
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:04,863
Yeah.

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,698
Did you see the movie<i> Aliens?</i>

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,067
I did.

29
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,868
Did you think it was cool?

30
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,373
Sure, I enjoyed it.

31
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,808
Me, too.

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,943
Football player, right?

33
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,144
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,813
Yeah.

35
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,681
Now, of course, before

36
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,250
we can set out
to explore the solar system,

37
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,953
we've got a few minor problems
to overcome.

38
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,855
Not the least of
which is, every time

39
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,690
we launch,
it costs the U.S. taxpayers

40
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,426
hundreds of millions of dollars.

41
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,261
No, no, no.

42
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,230
Yes. If you want to save money,

43
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,165
why don't you land
the booster rockets

44
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,701
instead of letting them drop
in the ocean?

45
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,773
That's a cute idea, but,
it's not technically possible.

46
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,408
Why not?

47
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,045
Well, it's hard to explain.

48
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,013
The math is pretty complicated.

49
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,748
Perhaps
I could help you with it.

50
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,383
Well,

51
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,452
I bet you could.

52
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,254
I'll bet you could.

53
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,991
I'll tell you what.
Here is a NASA patch.

54
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,294
Why don't you have your mom
sew that on your book bag? Now,

55
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,197
who here wants to know how
astronauts go to the bathroom?

56
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,765
- Me. I do.
- Right. See,

57
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,934
now, during liftoff,
all the astronauts

58
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,169
wear diapers.

59
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,271
<i>People often wonder why I chose</i>

60
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,306
<i>to pursue a career
in theoretical physics.</i>

61
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,443
<i>I usually respond by saying</i>

62
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,846
<i>I wanted to unravel the
inner workings of the universe.</i>

63
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,281
Yeah, perhaps when.

64
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,017
Captain Kirk said,
"To boldly go,"

65
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,253
he meant in one of those?

66
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,921
<i>But the real answer was</i>

67
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,323
<i>I wanted
to prove this nincompoop wrong.</i>

68
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,058
Yeah, that's right.
Beam me up, Potty!

69
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,947
<i>So I saw a lawyer today.</i>

70
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,215
Why?

71
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,384
I'm putting together
my last will and testament.

72
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,818
We're gonna miss ya.

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,220
George.

74
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,289
Don't worry.
I ain't leaving him squat.

75
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,557
Are you dyin'?

76
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,192
We're all dyin', honey.

77
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,426
From the second we're born,

78
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,395
it's just a slip and slide
into the darkness.

79
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,497
Unless you get bit by a vampire.

80
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,634
Well, now that goes
without saying.

81
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,204
I don't want to die.
I've only kissed

82
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,338
one boy so far.

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,506
What?

84
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,975
Relax. It was a long time ago.

85
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,377
Are you relaxed?

86
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,979
Shelly, you haven't

87
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,414
touched your dinner.

88
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,882
You feel okay?

89
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,451
Yes. I was just thinking.

90
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,019
About what, baby?

91
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,823
The optimal heighttowidth
ratio for a reusable rocket.

92
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,258
I was just

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,160
thinking the exact same thing.

94
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,861
Really?

95
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,530
Moonpie, I love you so much.

96
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,421
It's late. What
are you doing up?

97
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,490
I'm working
on the hyperbolic calculations

98
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,158
for a rocket return.

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
Need any help?

100
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,996
What?

101
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:27,165
I'm kiddin'. Now, turn out
the light and go to bed.

102
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,500
But... Now.

103
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,041
Dad, can we afford a computer?

104
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,543
You do my taxes.
What do you think?

105
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,579
Never mind.

106
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,981
Good night.

107
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,147
Meemaw?

108
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,052
Mr. Moonpie,
how might I help you?

109
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,921
How much money are you planning
to leave me when you die?

110
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,090
Nice talkin' to you.

111
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,659
Meemaw?

112
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,996
Want to try that again?

113
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,297
I need to buy a computer

114
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,499
so I can solve
the NavierStokes equation.

115
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,269
How much is a computer?

116
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,671
Apple has a nice one for $2,000,

117
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,207
but the kind I need costs
three million.

118
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,310
Let me see
what I got in the vault.

119
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,718
Nine bucks and...

120
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,256
Look at that... a peso.

121
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,593
It's warm.

122
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,135
Hello, First National Bank.

123
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,270
I'd like to speak
with a loan officer.

124
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,273
It's regarding a second mortgage
on my home.

125
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,176
My name is Sheldon Lee Cooper.

126
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,644
Sure, I'll hold.

127
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,148
I hate hold music.

128
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,449
Hello.

129
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,718
Yes, you can help me,
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

130
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,455
I'm interested in taking out
a second mortgage.

131
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,291
I'm nine years old.
Why do you ask?

132
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,661
That's called
age discrimination, Dorothy,

133
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,464
but I'm willing to let it slide.

134
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:43,168
I'm glad you find me cute,
but I'm deadly serious.

135
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,670
I need funds to buy a computer.

136
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,739
No, the house isn't in my name.

137
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,741
I'm nine.
We've established this.

138
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,444
I do prepare the taxes
for my parents,

139
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,146
and if we tighten our belts,

140
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,314
we'll have sufficient equity
for the loan.

141
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,716
Sheldon, who are you talking to?

142
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,152
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

143
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,486
Who's Dorothy Fitzpatrick?

144
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,288
Is she a new buddy from school?

145
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,458
She's the loan officer at The
First National Bank of Medford.

146
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,659
Why are you talking to her?

147
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,461
Mom, can this wait?

148
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,463
I'm trying
to negotiate favorable terms.

149
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,832
Hello. Dorothy?

150
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,606
Hey, how come you
weren't in math class?

151
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,042
That guy from NASA
treated me like a child,

152
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,278
and I need to prove him wrong.

153
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,612
You<i> are</i> a child.

154
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,347
Tread lightly, my friend.

155
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,617
Was Ms. Ingram upset
I wasn't in class?

156
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,219
Actually, she was happy.

157
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,188
She even did a little dance.

158
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,223
Do you know anybody
with a modem?

159
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,625
I think
Radio Shack has one. Why?

160
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,794
I need to access
thrusttoweight ratios

161
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,764
from the FTP server at
the Johnson Space Center.

162
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,765
Then what?

163
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,134
Then I show that guy
from NASA my work

164
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,236
and laugh as he begs for mercy.

165
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,239
You know, sometimes
you sound like a super villain.

166
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,340
Silence!

167
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,108
That'll be more effective after

168
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,510
your voice changes.

169
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,714
Silence.

170
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,284
Mom, can you take me
to Radio Shack?

171
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,086
Not today, baby.

172
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,655
I have to go food shopping
and get dinner started.

173
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,624
But it's important.

174
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,626
Sorry. Maybe over the weekend.

175
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,528
But it won't take that long.

176
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,330
Sheldon, I said no.

177
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,866
But, Mom... Not another word.

178
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,802
What?

179
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,570
Can't I just be happy?

180
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,642
Mom, please!

181
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,277
Sheldon Lee, I said no.

182
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,346
I'm still happy.

183
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,817
Please, Mom!
You're being unfair!

184
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,686
No. But I really need those
thrusttoweight ratios.

185
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,121
Do you see I'm cookin'?

186
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,123
Well, take me<i> after</i> dinner.

187
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,292
Enough! I'm not takin' you
anywhere tonight.

188
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,694
<i>I'm not proud of it,</i>

189
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,197
<i>but as a child, I was prone...</i>

190
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,232
<i>to the occasional meltdown.</i>

191
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,534
Cheese and crackers!

192
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,769
<i>I'm sorry you had to hear that.</i>

193
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,777
All right,
I finally got him calmed down.

194
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,345
How'd you manage that?

195
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,081
Easy. Gave him a hug
and a little cough syrup.

196
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,349
Mom!

197
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,019
It's not like he's
operating heavy machinery.

198
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,421
We can't keep putting
up with this behavior.

199
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,023
We need to ground him.

200
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,226
How? If you say "No playing
outside," he says, "Thank you."

201
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,894
Well, we need to do something.

202
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,963
It's just a tantrum.
It's what kids do.

203
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,998
You used to punish me
all the time.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,167
That was different.
You were a pain in the ass.

205
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,103
I say no Radio Shack
for at least a month.

206
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,371
Sounds fair.

207
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,673
I'll go tell him.

208
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,341
I'd wait and tell him tomorrow.

209
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,243
He's a little loopy right now.

210
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,382
Good night.

211
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,985
She drugged our son.

212
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,855
<i>Thus began the longest month
of my life.</i>

213
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,394
<i>Without the ability to access
the thrusttoweight ratios,</i>

214
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,331
<i>my wellintended effort
to humiliate a NASA scientist</i>

215
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,166
<i>ground to a halt.</i>

216
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,334
Mom.

217
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,269
What's going on?

218
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,438
Something's wrong with Sheldon.

219
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,343
What's the matter, baby?
Have a tummy ache?

220
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,744
I think it's an ulcer.

221
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,945
Don't be silly.

222
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,413
You must have eaten something.
No.

223
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,750
My symptoms are consistent
with an ulcer.

224
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,285
Shelly, remember
when you thought

225
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,388
you had leprosy, and it was
just a patch of dry skin?

226
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,257
And when you thought you had
gout? Or an enlarged prostate?

227
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,425
Or mad cow?

228
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,127
That was my favorite.

229
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,029
Well, this is different.

230
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,898
Maybe we should take
him to the doctor.

231
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,036
Listen to your wife...
Ulcers are serious.

232
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,440
Well, I've never seen this
in someone so young,

233
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,410
but, your son has an ulcer.

234
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,778
Thank you.

235
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,179
How could this happen?

236
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,415
There are a number of factors.

237
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,050
Has he been under

238
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,052
some unusual stress lately?

239
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,755
Yes. She won't take me
to Radio Shack.

240
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,056
Go wait outside.

241
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,457
I've heard
some interesting research

242
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,959
about treating ulcers

243
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,260
with antimicrobials.

244
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,262
Go.

245
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,798
And you're surprised
I have an ulcer.

246
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm surprised <i>I</i> don't have one.

247
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,303
Um, Radio Shack?

248
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,874
He's trying to figure out
how to help NASA land rockets.

249
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,876
Well, that's a nice thing.

250
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,577
He's just doing it out of spite.

251
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,080
Okay.

252
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,916
Well, keep him off spicy
foods for the time being,

253
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,985
and I'll write you
a prescription for Zantac.

254
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,486
Does he smoke?

255
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,156
'Course not. He's nine.

256
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,857
I started at his age.

257
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,826
But only when I drank.

258
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,329
What the...?

259
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,369
Sheldon! What are you doing?

260
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,238
I just need a minute.
These things are so slow.

261
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,809
Is this your family?

262
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,078
They're lovely.

263
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,418
Mom. What?

264
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,187
There's something wrong
with Sheldon again.

265
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,555
<i>I figured it out!</i>

266
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,390
I figured it out!

267
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,092
One night.

268
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,993
I want to sleep one night.

269
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,597
Hi, Mom.

270
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,099
<i>Hi there.</i>

271
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,406
<i>With my research complete
and my ulcer on the mend,</i>

272
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,542
<i>all that was left to do
was send my work to NASA</i>

273
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:28,847
<i>and wait to become America's
scientific sweetheart.</i>

274
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,551
<i>So I waited...</i>

275
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,324
<i>and waited...</i>

276
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,862
<i>and waited...</i>

277
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,640
<i>and waited.</i>

278
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,879
Something's wrong
with Sheldon again.

279
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,180
Now what?

280
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,283
Those people at NASA never
responded to his science stuff.

281
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,919
Damn it.
I've had enough of this.

282
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,921
Sheldon, get up.

283
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,923
What's the point?

284
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,392
We're going to Houston.

285
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,594
Really?

286
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,996
Yeah.

287
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,298
You and me are gonna give
those space monkeys

288
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,933
a little talkin' to.

289
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,336
<i>I often found my father to be</i>

290
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,205
<i>a strange and puzzling man,</i>

291
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,308
<i>but at that moment,
I never loved him more.</i>

292
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,218
I don't see why I
couldn't stay home.

293
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,121
'Cause we're having
a fun family outin'.

294
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,622
Can I at least drive?

295
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,825
She said fun, not tragic.

296
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,360
Let's go to the ostrich farm.

297
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,528
Cool.

298
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,530
We can ride 'em, and
then we can eat 'em.

299
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,832
We're not stopping anywhere.

300
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,800
We're going to Houston
to straighten this thing out

301
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,402
for your brother,
then we're going home.

302
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,404
Shelly, you doing okay?

303
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,873
Yes. I just hope I
don't get carsick.

304
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,108
You want Daddy to pull over?

305
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,277
I'll be okay.

306
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,281
<i>God, it's
on my shoes, it's on my shoes!</i>

307
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,418
<i>For Pete's sake,
somebody open a window.</i>

308
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,727
Yeah, I don't mean to be rude,

309
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,362
but we've been
waitin' for an hour

310
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,164
to see your boss.
I'm sorry, sir,

311
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,433
but you didn't have an appointment.
We didn't have

312
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,169
an appointment 'cause every time
I called, you put me on hold.

313
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,772
I'm sure Dr. Hodges'll see you
as soon as he can.

314
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,911
So, what do you want to do?
I don't know.

315
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,547
I guess we just got
to be patient and wait...

316
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,249
Aw, screw it!

317
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,583
Excuse me, sir,
you can't just...

318
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,352
All right, here's the deal.

319
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,354
My kid's got
a damn ulcer 'cause of you,

320
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,722
so either you
take him seriously,

321
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,590
or you're gonna be
taking<i> me</i> seriously.

322
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,593
Yes, sir?

323
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,161
Janice, why don't you

324
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,564
send the little boy in?

325
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,299
Right away.

326
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,336
He'll see you now.

327
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,605
You're up, Moonpie.

328
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,748
And here...

329
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,384
near apogee,
we gimbal the engine

330
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,852
to exert a torque

331
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,887
that executes
a pitchover maneuver

332
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,391
to flip the rocket
by 180 degrees.

333
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,627
Well, that's very impressive.

334
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,629
Thank you very much
for taking the time...

335
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,864
I'm not done.

336
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,200
Sorry.

337
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,602
Needless to say,

338
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,838
we use a P.I.D. controller
to minimize the dispersions

339
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,374
to the landing site.

340
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,643
Anything else?

341
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,779
Yes. I'd like a glass of water.

342
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,048
It's time to take my Zantac.

343
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,322
He's been in there
quite a while.

344
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,656
Well, if the topic

345
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,659
is science, he can be
a really Chatty Patty.

346
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,927
I'm bored.

347
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,696
Me, too. Hey.

348
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,365
Someday somebody's gonna write
a book about Sheldon.

349
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't you want there
to be a chapter

350
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:13,271
about how loving and supportive
you two were?

351
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,373
Doesn't matter.
I ain't reading it.

352
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,944
This is groundbreaking work.

353
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,879
Thank you. And...?

354
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,548
And...?

355
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,416
I thought you might want
to apologize.

356
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,417
Well...

357
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,919
why?

358
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,822
You tried to shut me up
with a patch.

359
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,758
Well... II give those
to everyone.

360
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
AAnd you have
to understand, Sheldon,

361
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,663
that while your math
isis theoretically correct,

362
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,400
we don't have the technical
capability to execute it.

363
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,469
So I'm ahead of my time?

364
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,572
Well... it would appear so.

365
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,741
All right, call me
when you catch up.

366
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,876
W...

367
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,611
We can go now.

368
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,993
<i>I've often contemplated
what might have happened</i>

369
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,863
<i>if my father hadn't stuck up
for me that day.</i>

370
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,965
<i>Would I have gone on to become</i>

371
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,933
<i>a worldclass
theoretical physicist,</i>

372
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,404
<i>or just your average Joe
Sixpack theoretical physicist?</i>

373
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,571
Dad?

374
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,939
Yeah?

375
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,008
Thank you.

376
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,078
You're welcome.

377
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,549
We're real proud of you, honey.

378
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,720
Are you proud of me and Georgie?
Of course.

379
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,754
You bet.

380
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,456
For what?

381
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,491
Don't go pokin' at it.

382
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,808
<i>For the first time,</i>

383
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,944
<i>SpaceX has successfully landed
its Falcon 9 rocket</i>

384
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,747
<i>on a drone ship
in the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

385
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,089
<i>SpaceX founder Elon Musk
called the event</i>

386
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,592
<i>an "incredible milestone
in the history of space."</i>

387
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,336
Elon, the CNN reporter's here
to talk to you. Hang on.

388
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,042
Send him in.
