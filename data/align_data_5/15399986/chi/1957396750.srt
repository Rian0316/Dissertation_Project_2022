1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
Come here, girl. Jess, Jess.

1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
过来，姑娘。杰斯，杰斯。

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
DOG BARKS

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
狗吠

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
DOOR CHIMES

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
门铃

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
This way, Mrs Brompton.
Thank you.

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
这边，布朗普顿夫人。
谢谢你。

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
To what do we owe the pleasure?

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
我们应该享受什么？

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
Well, it's that time of year.

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
嗯，这是一年中的那个时候。

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
Oh, the Daffodil Ball, I've been
counting the days.

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
哦，水仙花球，我一直在
数日子。

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,360
And who's the lucky lass tonight?

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,360
谁是今晚的幸运儿？

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
Who can say at this point,
Mrs Brompton.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
在这一点上谁能说，
布朗普顿夫人。

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Ah, Jim, Jim, perfect timing.

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Ah, Jim, Jim, perfect timing.

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,840
Ah, wallet!

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,840
啊，钱包！

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm sorry, what am I paying for now?

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,720
对不起，我现在付什么钱？

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
It's the Daffodil Ball tonight.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
今晚是水仙花舞会。

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
All proceeds go towards the
restoration of the steeple.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
所有收益都用于
修复尖塔。

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
It's the highlight of the social
calendar.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
这是社交
日历的亮点。

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
There'll be music, dancing, the
frisson of a warm spring evening.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
会有音乐、舞蹈
和温暖的春夜的颤栗。

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
Mr Farnon not in?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
法农先生不在？

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
He's yet to grace us
with his presence.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
他的存在还没有给我们
带来恩典。

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,600
How about it, Mrs Hall, a ticket
for you?

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,600
怎么样，霍尔太太，
给你一张票？

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Just four, please. Four?

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,920
请只给四个。四？

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Yeah, need one for my date
for the evening.

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
是的，我
晚上的约会需要一个。

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Your date?

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
你的约会？

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,480
The day is young.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,480
天还年轻。

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
Come on, Jim, no girl likes a
cheapskate.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
来吧，吉姆，没有女孩喜欢
小气鬼。

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Who's the extra one for?
Who do you think?

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
多给谁？
你认为是谁？

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,480
Time waits for no man, Jim lad, and
neither will Helen.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,480
时间不等人，吉姆小伙子，
海伦也不会。

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
Morning, Mrs Brompton.

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
早上好，布朗普顿夫人。

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
Diana - please.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
戴安娜 - 请。

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
How can we be of service?

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
我们如何为您服务？

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
Daffodil Ball.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
水仙球。

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
If you're not too busy I wondered

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
如果你不是太忙，我想

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
if we might lure you on to the dance
floor.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
如果我们可以引诱你到舞池
。

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
Well, that depends what you're using
as bait.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
嗯，这取决于你用什么
作为诱饵。

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
SHE GIGGLES

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
她咯咯地笑

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
Stop it.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
停下来。

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
It would be our pleasure to
support the cause.

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
我们很高兴
支持这项事业。

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,280
Tristan, money? Yeah.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,280
特里斯坦，钱？是的。

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,120
"Our pleasure" really?

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,120
“我们的快乐”真的吗？

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
And, uh, Mrs Hall, would you mind
showing Diana out?

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
而且，呃，霍尔夫人，你介意把
戴安娜带出去吗？

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
Show her out?

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
给她看？

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
We'll have to scrape her off him
first.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
我们得先把她从他身上刮下来
。

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
This way.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
这边走。

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,080
Swap. Thank you. Thank you,
bye-bye...

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,080
交换。谢谢你。谢谢，
再见……

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,680
What?

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,680
什么？

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
What, is it?

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
它是什么？

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,240
I mean, if you can't see, then

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,240
我的意思是，如果你看不到，那么

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,880
there's really no hope for you,
brother.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,880
你真的没有希望了，
兄弟。

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,560
If that woman were any more forward,
she'd be here yesterday.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,560
如果那个女人再向前，
她昨天就会在这里。

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Nonsense, Diana's happily married.

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
废话，戴安娜的婚姻美满。

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Isn't she?

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
她不是吗？

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
Not any longer. Not for a year now.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
没有了。现在不是一年。

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Well, she was probably just
being friendly.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
好吧，她可能只是
出于友好。

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,040
You know, I heard he ran off with
the housekeeper.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,040
你知道，我听说他和
管家跑了。

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
I heard the gardener.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
我听到了园丁的声音。

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
How did you get on with Merrick last
night?

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
昨晚你和梅里克相处得怎么样？

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
I thought you were going to tag
that on to the end of your list.

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
我以为你会把它标记
到你的清单的末尾。

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Oh, James, you really can't allow
yourself to be so forgetful.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
哦，詹姆斯，你真的不能让
自己这么健忘。

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,880
The memory is a muscle that must be
exercised.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,880
记忆力是一块必须
锻炼的肌肉。

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
I'll get up there right away.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
我马上上去。

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,240
No, no, you've got a busy surgery
today.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,240
不，不，你
今天的手术很忙。

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
Here.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
这里。

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Organised as ever.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
一如既往地组织起来。

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,760
Why doesn't Tristan stay
and help out?

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,760
为什么特里斯坦不留下来
帮忙？

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
With both examination rooms
in operation,

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
随着两间考场
的运作，

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
we'd get through them a lot quicker.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
我们会更快地通过它们。

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,440
I'd like to keep Tristan under my
wing for a while.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,440
我想让特里斯坦在我的保护下
一段时间。

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,880
He's still got a lot to learn.

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,880
他还有很多东西要学。

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Go on, go and get ready.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
来吧，去准备吧。

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr Farnon - postcard from Dorothy.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
法农先生 - 来自多萝西的明信片。

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Who's the old Siegfried?

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
谁是老齐格弗里德？

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
And why does she hope he gets out
from time to time?

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
而她为什么希望他
时不时地出去？

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Sorry, I thought it were for me.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
对不起，我以为是给我的。

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
I didn't realise until it were too
late.

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
我没有意识到，直到为时已
晚。

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm sure.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
我确定。

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
HORN BLARES

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
喇叭喇叭

76
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
All right, all right, I'm coming.

76
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
好了好了，我来了。

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,520
No Rover? Not today, it's leaking
oil everywhere.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,520
没有路虎？不是今天，
到处都是漏油。

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Do your tie up, man, we must present
our very best self to our clients.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
做好准备，伙计，我们必须
向客户展示我们最好的自己。

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
You know, you could do far worse
than Diana Brompton.

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
你知道，你可以做得
比戴安娜布朗普顿差得多。

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I see you got another postcard from
Dorothy.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
我看到你收到
多萝西寄来的另一张明信片。

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
How's Malta?

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
马耳他怎么样？

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Hot and rocky.

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,400
炎热而崎岖。

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
She's looking forward to becoming a
grandmother.

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
她期待着成为
祖母。

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Shame, I got the impression you were
rather fond of her.

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,520
不好意思，我感觉你
挺喜欢她的。

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, hang on, hang on, slow down,
slow down.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,800
哦，坚持，坚持，慢下来，
慢下来。

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,680
Stop.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,680
停止。

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Morning, Helen.

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
早上好，海伦。

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,520
All right, Triss, Siegfried.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,520
好的，特莉丝，齐格弗里德。

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
What can I do for you?

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
我能为你做什么？

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, it's not me, actually.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
哦，其实不是我。

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
Um, I think James wanted to see
you about something.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
嗯，我想詹姆斯想见
你谈一些事情。

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,720
He's at the house if you wanted to
pop in.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,720
如果你想
进来，他就在家里。

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
Right.

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
对。

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
Thanks.

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
谢谢。

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Bye. BOTH: Bye.

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
再见。双方：再见。

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
Helen. Hello.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
海伦。你好。

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
Please, come in, come in.

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
请进，进。

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Come on through.

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
来吧。

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,520
There we are.

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,520
我们到了。

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
OK, then...

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
好吧...

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
..how can I help?

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
..我能帮忙吗？

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
I thought you wanted to see me.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
我以为你想见我。

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
You did? I mean, I do. Why wouldn't
I?

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
你做到了吗？我的意思是，我愿意。我为什么不
呢？

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course I'd like to see you...

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
我当然想见你...

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Right.

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
对。

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Only, I've got to get back and put
our carrots in, so, shall we?

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,320
只是，我得回去把
我们的胡萝卜放进去，所以，我们可以吗？

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,680
Sorry, shall we what?

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,680
对不起，我们怎么办？

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,400
The reason you wanted to see me.

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,400
你想见我的原因。

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm not sure I understand -
you came here.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,680
我不确定我是否理解 -
你来过这里。

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
Because Tristan asked me to.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
因为特里斯坦让我这么做。

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
Ah.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
啊。

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,360
He said you wanted to speak to me
about something.

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,360
他说你想和我
谈谈一些事情。

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm sure he did.

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
我确定他做到了。

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,400
Well...

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,400
好...

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Triss and I are going to the
Daffodil Ball.

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
特莉丝和我要去
水仙花舞会。

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
And I couldn't be happier for you.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
我为你感到高兴。

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
Oh, no, no, he's not...
Not together.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
哦，不，不，他没有……
没有在一起。

118
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
I mean, well, we are but not...

118
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
我的意思是，我们是，但不是……

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
James, it's fine...

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
詹姆斯，没关系……

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,640
..you have my blessings.

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,640
..你有我的祝福。

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,360
See, because of that...

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,360
看，正因为如此……

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
..now I'm not inviting you.

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
..现在我不是在邀请你。

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,320
I had a spare ticket but I'll just
have to give it to someone else.

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,320
我有一张备用票，但我必须
把它给别人。

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
Probably for the best.

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
可能是最好的。

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,440
I haven't really been out since...

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,440
自从我真的没有出去...

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
..well...

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
..好...

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
No-one will care.

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
没有人会在意。

128
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
We'll go as a group, you, me,
Triss...

128
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
我们一起去，你，我，
特莉丝……

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
..whoever he manages to drag along.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
..无论他设法拖着谁。

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm a terrible dancer,

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
我是一个糟糕的舞者，

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,000
so that amusement alone is a good
enough reason to come.

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,000
因此，仅娱乐就
足以成为您来的理由。

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
I don't know.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
我不知道。

133
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
DOOR CHIMES

133
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
门铃

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
It's my dog.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
是我的狗

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
He disappeared yesterday
evening on one of our walks.

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
他昨天
晚上在我们的一次散步中失踪了。

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,920
I found him when I went back out
again this morning,

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,920
今天早上我再出去的时候发现了他，

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,360
he must've been in this
trap all night.

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,360
他一定
整晚都在这个圈套里。

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Well, bring him through.

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,040
好吧，带他过去。

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,160
James!

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,160
詹姆士！

140
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
DOG WHINES

140
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
狗叫声

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,120
I need you!

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,120
我需要你！

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't worry, go.

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
别着急，走吧。

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
We need to get him something for the
pain and sedated right away.

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
我们需要给他一些
止痛药并立即镇静。

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
What's his name? It's Rock.

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
他的名字是什么？是摇滚。

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,320
Mrs Hall, pass the cotton wool,
please.

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,320
霍尔太太，
请把棉线递过去。

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
You'll be able to save him,
won't you?

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
你一定能救他的，
不是吗？

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
I can't tell.

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
我说不清。

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,800
I won't be able to tell you
until I've explored the wound.

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,800
在我探查伤口之前，我无法告诉你。

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Who would do such a thing?

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
谁会做这种事？

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,360
It's monstrous.

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,360
太可怕了。

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,880
Oh, it looks a mess.

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,880
哦，看起来一团糟。

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,640
I won't know until I'm right
inside how bad it is.

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,640
我不会知道，直到我就
在里面，它有多糟糕。

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,840
What I'd do for an X-ray machine
now.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,840
我现在会为 X 光机做些什么
。

154
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
Doesn't seem natural, being able to

154
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
看起来不自然，能够

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
see your insides on the outside like
that.

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
像
这样在外面看到你的内在。

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,080
They're an incredible diagnostic
tool.

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,080
它们是令人难以置信的诊断
工具。

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,160
All right, he's asleep.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,160
好吧，他睡着了。

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,320
I don't think the leg's broken.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,320
我不认为腿断了。

159
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,400
We better hope there's still some
circulation to the paw.

159
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,400
我们最好希望
爪子还有一些循环。

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
And if there's not?

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
如果没有？

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm afraid he'll lose the foot.

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,440
我怕他会失去一只脚。

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Colonel, good morning.

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
上校，早上好。

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Now, then, Farnon, what's all this
about?

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
那么，法农，这到底是怎么回事
？

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
We were expecting you last night.

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
昨晚我们在等你。

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, I'm afraid, there was
something

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
是的，我害怕，有
什么事

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
of an administrative balls up.

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
的行政球了。

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
My colleague missed you off his
list.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
我的同事想念你的
名单。

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh, and there I was believing I was
one of your most valued clients.

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,280
哦，在那里我相信我是
你最重要的客户之一。

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh, I'm almost hurt.

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,920
哦，我快受伤了。

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
Rest assured, you have my undivided
attention now.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
请放心，您
现在得到了我的全神贯注。

171
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
Bag please, Tristan.

171
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
请提包，特里斯坦。

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Yes, err, unfortunately, I've

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
是的，错误，不幸的是，我已经

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
had to find another dance partner.

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
不得不另找舞伴。

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Sorry to say, too little, too late,
old chap.

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,320
对不起，太少了，太晚了，
老家伙。

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,680
Still, there's, there's nothing like
a bit of healthy

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,680
尽管如此，没有什么
比健康更重要的了

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,960
competition to keep you on your
toes, hey, Farnon?

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,960
竞争让你保持
警觉，嘿，法农？

177
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
Indeed.

177
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
的确。

178
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
George, what a qualified pleasure it
is to see you.

178
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
乔治，
见到你真是太高兴了。

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
HE LAUGHS

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
他笑了

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
Now, now, chaps, we mustn't
squabble.

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
现在，现在，伙计们，我们不能
争吵。

181
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
I'd hate to be the bone between a
pair of scrapping dogs.

181
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
我不想成为一
对废狗之间的骨头。

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
If you're finding yourself
unable to cope,

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
如果你发现自己
无法应付，

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
I could always take a few more
clients off your hands.

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
我总能从
你手中夺走更多的客户。

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm perfectly capa... More than
capable, thank you.

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
我完全有
能力...不仅仅是有能力，谢谢。

185
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, there's no shame in admitting
you can't keep up.

185
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,720
哦，承认
你跟不上，并不可耻。

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
The years are rolling on.

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
岁月在流转。

187
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
Ha-ha, the coup de grace.

187
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
哈哈，致命一击。

188
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Until next time, Hubert.

188
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
直到下一次，休伯特。

189
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,840
Rolling on? You're rolling on.

189
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,840
滚？你继续前进。

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
He's older than I am.

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
他比我大。

191
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
Still, since you've come all this
way,

191
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
不过既然你这么过来了
，

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,000
there's no harm in you casting
an expert eye over her.

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,000
你
对她投以专家的眼光没有坏处。

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
I imagine there wouldn't be a

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
我想不会有

194
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
charge - on account of all the
bother.

194
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
收费 - 考虑到所有的
麻烦。

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,120
No, of course not, Hubert...

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,120
不，当然不是，休伯特……

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
..anything for our most valued
customer.

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
..为我们最重要的
客户提供任何服务。

197
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
I've asked this morning's clients to
come back this afternoon.

197
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
我已经请今天上午的客户
今天下午回来。

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
I don't understand why Siegfried
doesn't let Tristan run surgery.

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
我不明白为什么齐格弗里德
不让特里斯坦做手术。

199
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,880
If there were two of us, we wouldn't
have to send anyone away.

199
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,880
如果我们有两个人，我们就不用
派人离开了。

200
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Mr Farnon has his ways...

200
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
法农先生有他的方式......

201
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,080
..maddening as they might be.

201
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,080
..令人抓狂。

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
It's best to let sleeping dogs lie.
Mm.

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
最好让熟睡的狗撒谎。
毫米。

203
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm not sure I'd describe Siegfried
as a sleeping dog.

203
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,200
我不确定我是否会将齐格弗里德描述
为一只熟睡的狗。

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
Thanks.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
谢谢。

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
How's he getting on?

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
他过得怎么样？

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
I'd like to be able to give
Mr Hammond some good news.

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
我想告诉
哈蒙德先生一些好消息。

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,840
I don't think the bone is broken.

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,840
我不认为骨头坏了。

208
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
We need to hope it's not infected.

208
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
我们需要希望它没有被感染。

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,880
Seems like a nice chap.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,880
看起来是个不错的家伙。

210
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
He does.

210
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
他是这样的。

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
He is.

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
他是。

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,400
I better get a brew on before he
wears a hole in the floor.

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,400
我最好在他
在地板上穿一个洞之前喝一杯。

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,480
I'll do the best I can.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,480
我会尽我所能。

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
102.5.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
102.5.

215
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
Stethoscope.

215
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
听诊器。

216
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,240
Thank you, Tristan.

216
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,240
谢谢你，特里斯坦。

217
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
Pandhi said her insides are blocked
up,

217
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
潘迪说她的内脏被堵住
了，

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
gave her some linseed oil to
grease the wheels.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
给了她一些亚麻籽油来
润滑车轮。

219
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
Really?

219
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
真的吗？

220
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Well, that's one way of doing it,
I suppose.

220
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
嗯，
我想这是一种方法。

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
And that's not the treatment you'd
prescribe?

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
这不是你
开的治疗方法？

222
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Well, we all have our different
approaches, Colonel.

222
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
好吧，我们都有不同的
方法，上校。

223
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,160
And different degrees of success
that go with them.

223
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,160
以及
随之而来的不同程度的成功。

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,200
COW MOOS

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,200
牛摩丝

225
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Yes, I thought so.

225
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
是的，我是这么想的。

226
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
You're struggling, aren't you, old
girl?

226
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
你在挣扎，是不是，
老姑娘？

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Stomach powders. Coming right up.

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,280
胃粉。马上就来。

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm afraid there's definitely
a blockage.

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,480
恐怕肯定
有堵塞。

229
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
It could be she's had too much
roughage and that's bunged

229
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
可能是她吃的
粗粮太多了

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,320
her up or there could be a wire or
something else caught up inside.

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,320
或者里面可能有电线或
其他东西。

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, it sounds serious.

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
嗯，听起来很严重。

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
More common than you'd think.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
比你想象的更常见。

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,960
Did Pandhi not mention the
possibility?

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,960
潘迪没有提到这种
可能性吗？

234
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,720
I told my stock man to wait for you,
Farnon.

234
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,720
我告诉我的
经纪人等你，法农。

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
Lesson learned.

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
学过的知识。

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,520
We'll start off with the powders to
help her work it through and

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,520
我们将从粉末开始
帮助她完成它

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,640
if that doesn't shift it, I'm afraid
we'll have to come back and operate.

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,640
如果那不能改变它，恐怕
我们将不得不回来操作。

238
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
COW MOOS

238
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
牛摩丝

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Mr Hammond?

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
哈蒙德先生？

240
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, noticed the timing's off.

240
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,320
哦，注意到时间不对了。

241
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
Well, I put it forward every
morning.

241
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
嗯，我每天
早上都提出来。

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,880
Well, I could fix it for you, if you
like?

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,880
好吧，如果你
愿意，我可以帮你修好？

243
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh, I've got used to it now.

243
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,200
哦，我现在已经习惯了。

244
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Sometimes I put it forward more
than I should

244
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
有时我
比我应该提出的更多

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,440
to get them out the house sooner.

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,440
让他们早点离开家。

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
Well...

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
好...

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,520
..there speaks a woman wise to the
world.

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,520
..有一个女人对
世界说话。

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Wise to the lot I've been lumbered
with, certainly.

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,440
当然，对于我一直困扰的很多事情是明智的
。

249
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Sorry, I've never been good at
waiting for news,

249
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
对不起，我一直不擅长
等待消息，

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
I have to keep myself busy.

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
我得让自己忙起来。

251
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
You and me both.

251
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
你和我都。

252
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Mr Herriot is a wonderful vet.

252
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Herriot 先生是一位出色的兽医。

253
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
If you want any more milk, you just
let me know.

253
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
如果你想要更多的牛奶，你就
告诉我。

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
I will.

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
我会。

255
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm sorry, in the rush,
I didn't catch your name.

255
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,080
抱歉，匆匆忙忙，
没听清你的名字。

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
It's...

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
它的...

257
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,640
..Audrey.

257
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,640
..奥黛丽。

258
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,960
Gerald.

258
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,960
杰拉德。

259
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Sugar, I forgot the sugar.

259
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,960
糖，我忘了糖。

260
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll just, um.

260
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,240
我只是，嗯。

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,840
No, no, I can leave that.

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,840
不，不，我可以离开那个。

262
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,440
And I'll come back with your, uh...

262
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,440
我会和你一起回来，呃...

263
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
..with the, um... Sugar.

263
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
..与，嗯......糖。

264
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
That's the chap.

264
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
那是章。

265
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
What's this? It's the list.

265
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
这是什么？这是清单。

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
The list, man. Don't look like that,
tell me what's next. Oh.

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
名单，伙计。不要看起来那样，
告诉我接下来要做什么。哦。

267
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
Mr Dinsdale.

267
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
丁斯代尔先生。

268
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,480
Ah, yes, sow, aural haematoma.

268
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,480
啊，是的，母猪，耳朵血肿。

269
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
See? All up here.

269
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
看？都在这

270
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Why would you have Merrick
written twice?

270
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,200
你为什么要让梅里克
写两遍？

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
Well, I wouldn't.

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
好吧，我不会。

272
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Unless this was left in your pocket
from last night.

272
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
除非这是
昨晚留在你口袋里的。

273
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,480
Which would suggest you were
supposed

273
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,480
这表明你
应该

274
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
to go to Merrick's and not James?

274
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
去梅里克而不是詹姆斯？

275
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,760
What're you doing?

275
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,760
你在做什么？

276
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,680
We must present our best self for
the clients, Siegfried.

276
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,680
我们必须
向客户展示最好的自己，齐格弗里德。

277
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,920
Morning.

277
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,920
早晨。

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh, we thought it'd be a grand
adventure...

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
哦，我们认为这将是一次伟大的
冒险......

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
..too young to know any better.

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
..太年轻了，不知道更好。

280
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
You were in good company.

280
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
你们相处得很好。

281
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
I should never have been there in
the first place,

281
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
我一开始就不应该去那里
，

282
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,960
I lied to the recruiting officer
about my age.

282
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,960
我向招聘官谎报了
我的年龄。

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh, God, you were one of those...

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,600
哦，上帝，你就是其中之一……

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,280
..king, country.

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,280
..国王，国家。

285
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
The usual nonsense.

285
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
平常的废话。

286
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,880
You know, funny thing is...

286
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,880
你知道，有趣的是...

287
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,720
..I wouldn't change it for the
world.

287
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,720
..我不会为这个
世界改变它。

288
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,120
Even though it left me hobbling
about.

288
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,120
尽管它让我蹒跚而行
。

289
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The struggle makes everything all
the more worth it.

289
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
奋斗让一切都
变得更值得。

290
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,840
I'll keep telling myself that.

290
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,840
我会一直这样告诉自己。

291
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,360
Mr Hammond, you can come through.

291
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,360
哈蒙德先生，你可以通过。

292
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,200
Thank you for the tea.

292
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,200
谢谢你的茶。

293
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,920
We've patched him up.

293
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,920
我们已经修补了他。

294
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm worried there could be an
infection,

294
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,760
好担心会不会
感染

295
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,360
the wound must've been open for some
time.

295
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,360
伤口肯定已经开放了一段
时间。

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,480
If it spreads, it could poison the
blood stream.

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,480
如果它扩散，它可能毒害
血液。

297
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
And then what?

297
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
然后什么？

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,280
There's still a chance he could lose
the leg.

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,280
他仍然有可能失去
这条腿。

299
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
Hm, better that than his life.

299
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
嗯，比他的命还好。

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
Leave him with us for a few days.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
把他留在我们身边几天。

301
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
Hey, you'll be all right, Rock, lad.

301
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
嘿，你会没事的，洛克，小伙子。

302
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,960
This nice gentleman and kind lady
are going to take care of you.

302
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,960
这位善良的绅士和善良的女士
会照顾你。

303
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
And Jess will keep him company.

303
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
Jess 会陪着他。

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,720
Will we be seeing you at the dance
then?

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,720
那我们会在舞会上见到你
吗？

305
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,040
God willing.

305
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,040
天意。

306
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
So long as you fulfil your
professional obligations first.

306
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
只要你先履行你的
职业义务。

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
And, by God, I naturally mean my
brother.

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
而且，上帝，我自然是指我的
兄弟。

308
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Them eggs will not collect
themselves, you know.

308
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
他们的鸡蛋不会
自己收集，你知道。

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,560
Should have kept her locked in
the coal shed.

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,560
应该把她锁在
煤棚里。

310
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
Our little Buttercup's in here.

310
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
我们的小毛毛在这里。

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Now, that boil on her noggin's even
bigger than last time you were up.

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,840
现在，她头上的沸腾
比你上次起床时还要大。

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,320
I didn't have the correct instrument
to complete the procedure.

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,320
我没有正确的仪器
来完成这个程序。

313
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Here's our little lass now.

313
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
现在是我们的小姑娘了。

314
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

314
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
圣母玛利亚，天主之母。

315
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Oh, yes ,I can see from here the
haematoma's even more engorged.

315
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
哦，是的，我从这里可以看到
血肿更加充血了。

316
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,960
Ah, looks fit to burst.

316
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,960
啊，看来要炸了。

317
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,120
I thought about going in and having
a go myself, like...

317
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,120
我想
自己进去试一试，就像......

318
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,720
..not for very long, mind.

318
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,720
..不要太久，介意。

319
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes, well, it's becoming apparent to
me

319
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
是的，这对
我来说变得很明显

320
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
now why you might have left your
scalpel at home last time.

320
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
现在为什么你
上次可能把手术刀留在家里了。

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
Thankfully, I believe we have it
here today. Mm.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
谢天谢地，我相信我们
今天在这里。毫米。

322
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,320
I don't know why you're
handing that to me,

322
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,320
我不知道你为什么
把它交给我，

323
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,080
we learn by doing, little brother.

323
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,080
我们边做边学，小兄弟。

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,040
I imagine she's called Buttercup
because uh...

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,040
我想她被称为毛茛
是因为呃...

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
..well, despite appearances, she's
a tender and sweet soul at heart?

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
..嗯，尽管外表，她内心深处是
一个温柔甜美的灵魂？

326
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Not as it goes.

326
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,000
不是这样。

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,560
Nearly took me finger off once.

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,560
有一次差点把我的手指拿开。

328
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,840
If she gets hold of you, my advice
is to play dead.

328
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,840
如果她抓住你，我的建议
是装死。

329
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
Unless you think she might actually
kill you,

329
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
除非你认为她真的会
杀了你，

330
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
in which case, don't...

330
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
在这种情况下，不要...

331
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,440
..play dead, I mean.

331
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,440
..装死，我是说。

332
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Right.

332
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
对。

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
Siegfried? Come now, Tristan.

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
齐格弗里德？来吧，特里斯坦。

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
It's alright to be frightened,
for without fear,

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
害怕也没关系，
因为没有恐惧，

335
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,680
there cannot be courage.

335
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,680
没有勇气。

336
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,960
Ha, without courage, there can't be
pain.

336
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,960
哈，没有勇气，就没有
痛苦。

337
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
# I'm called Little Buttercup

337
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
#我叫小毛毛

338
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,280
# Dear Little Buttercup. #

338
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,280
#亲爱的小毛茛。#

339
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Try not to startle it!

339
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
尽量不要吓到它！

340
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
Forget the pig, you startled me!

340
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
忘记猪，你吓到我了！

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,240
Good Buttercup.

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,240
好的毛茛。

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Good pig.

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
好猪。

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
黄油杯咕噜声

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,680
Oh, God!

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,680
天啊！

345
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,920
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

345
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,920
黄油杯咕噜声

346
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Oh, ah.

346
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,440
哦，啊。

347
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
Mr Dinsdale, I fear we may have to
return with anaesthetic

347
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
丁斯代尔先生，我担心我们可能不得不
打麻药回来

348
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
to tame the beast before we operate.

348
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
在我们操作之前驯服野兽。

349
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, aye, when would that be then?

349
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
哦，是的，那会是什么时候？

350
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,240
Oh, not until this evening. What?

350
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,240
哦，直到今晚。什么？

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
No, Siegfried, we can't come back.

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
不，齐格弗里德，我们不能回来了。

352
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,680
Look, we're here now, I'll do it
now.

352
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,680
看，我们现在在这里，我
现在就去做。

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,640
He's either very brave or very
stupid.

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,640
他要么非常勇敢，要么非常
愚蠢。

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,000
I believe it's a heady mixture of
both.

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,000
我相信这是
两者的令人兴奋的混合。

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,440
No courage without fear.

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,440
没有恐惧就没有勇气。

356
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,040
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

356
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,040
黄油杯咕噜声

357
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
Good God!

357
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
天哪！

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
I admire your persistence

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
佩服你的坚持

359
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,240
but sometimes discretion is
the better part of valour.

359
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,240
但有时谨慎是
勇气的更好部分。

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
He's done it.

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
他做到了。

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,760
I'll be damned.

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,760
我完蛋了。

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
I did?

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
我做的？

363
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
I mean, yes, I did.

363
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
我的意思是，是的，我做到了。

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes, well, you made a bit of meal of
it but you got there in the end.

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,480
是的，好吧，你吃了
一点，但你最终到达了那里。

365
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,520
Maybe I'll, uh, see you later.

365
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,520
也许我会，呃，待会见。

366
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,400
Tristan, it's this way.

366
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,400
特里斯坦，就是这样。

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,480
Frowning at it won't change it.

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,480
皱眉不会改变它。

368
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,960
It's from a friend of my mum's.

368
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,960
是我妈妈的一个朋友寄来的。

369
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,640
He owns a vet's practice in Glasgow.
Hm.

369
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,640
他在格拉斯哥拥有一家兽医诊所。
嗯。

370
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,520
They've offered me a job.

370
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,520
他们给了我一份工作。

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Well, I'm not surprised.

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,880
嗯，我并不感到惊讶。

372
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
Who wouldn't want you working for
them?

372
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
谁不想让你为
他们工作？

373
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Mum seems to have accepted it for
me.

373
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
妈妈似乎已经为
我接受了。

374
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,400
Oh, dear.

374
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,400
哦亲爱的。

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
The practice is run by a man
called Bill Weipers.

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
该诊所由一位
名叫比尔·韦伯斯（Bill Weipers）的人经营。

376
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,320
He's on the board at Glasgow
Veterinary College.

376
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,320
他是格拉斯哥
兽医学院的董事会成员。

377
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
He employs modern methods
and equipment.

377
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
他采用现代方法
和设备。

378
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
He has an immaculate practice,

378
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
他有一个完美的练习，

379
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,480
sterile examination rooms, nurses,

379
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,480
无菌检查室、护士、

380
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
X-ray machine.

380
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
X光机。

381
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,760
And you got lumbered with us lot.

381
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,760
你和我们在一起很麻烦。

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
well, it's just a different...

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
嗯，这只是一个不同的......

383
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
..very different way of working.

383
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
..非常不同的工作方式。

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
If you ever have any ideas about how

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
如果你有任何想法

385
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,320
you might improve this place,

385
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,320
你可能会改善这个地方，

386
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
I'm sure Mr Farnon would hear you
out.

386
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
我相信法农先生会听到你的
。

387
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,360
If you catch him on a good day,
perhaps.

387
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,360
如果你在美好的一天抓住他，
也许。

388
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,640
It's more complicated than
that, Dad's struggling to get work.

388
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,640
比这更复杂
，爸爸正在努力找工作。

389
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,280
They're really struggling to
make ends meet.

389
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,280
他们真的在努力
维持生计。

390
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,880
Well, they'd want you to be happy.

390
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,880
好吧，他们希望你快乐。

391
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,520
As a parent, that's all you want for
your children.

391
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,520
作为父母，这就是您对
孩子的全部要求。

392
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,680
It feels so selfish.

392
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,680
感觉好自私啊

393
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
They spent their life savings
putting

393
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
他们用毕生积蓄
投入

394
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
me through college, I owe it to
them.

394
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
我通过大学，我欠
他们。

395
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,840
How long have you got to decide?

395
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,840
你需要多长时间做决定？

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,080
I've got a few months to work out

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,080
我有几个月的时间去锻炼

397
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,840
if there's something here worth
staying for.

397
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,840
如果这里有值得
停留的地方。

398
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,200
Or someone?

398
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,200
还是某人？

399
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,840
Helen took the other one.

399
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,840
海伦拿了另一个。

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
How many cases have we got to get
through this afternoon?

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
今天下午我们要处理多少案子？

401
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
16.

401
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
16.

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,280
We'll use both examination rooms.

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,280
我们将使用两个考场。

403
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,240
While I'm treating an animal in
one...

403
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,240
当我在治疗一只动物时
...

404
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
I'll settle the next one into the
other room.

404
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
我会安排下一个到
另一个房间。

405
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Once I've finished treatment, you
show them out, settle up the bill.

405
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,200
一旦我完成治疗，你
把他们展示出来，结账。

406
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,040
I'll go straight through to deal
with the next. Righto.

406
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,040
我会直接过去处理
下一个。对。

407
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
Hello, there.

407
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
你好呀。

408
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
Hello.

408
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
你好。

409
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
Good afternoon. Mr Herriot.

409
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
下午好。赫里奥特先生。

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
Afternoon. Hello.

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
下午。你好。

411
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
Right, Mrs Kirkby, with a rabbit.

411
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
对，柯克比夫人，带着一只兔子。

412
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
That's me.

412
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
这就是我。

413
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
Lovely.

413
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
迷人的。

414
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
Miss Fearnly? Yes, lovely.

414
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
费恩利小姐？是的，可爱。

415
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
Would you like to come through?

415
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
你想通过吗？

416
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
Thank you, Mrs Jackson.

416
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
谢谢你，杰克逊夫人。

417
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,920
Keep George warm by the fire,
that'll help speed up the waking
process.

417
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,920
让乔治在火边保持温暖，
这将有助于加快醒来的
过程。

418
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
Thank you, love.

418
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
谢谢你，爱。

419
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
It's Anne with Susie.
I'll be with you in a second.

419
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
是安妮和苏茜。
我一会就来陪你。

420
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
And don't you look happy about it.

420
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
你看起来不高兴吗。

421
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Sorry, I've been rushed off my feet.

421
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
对不起，我已经被吓跑了。

422
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,000
Hello, Susie.

422
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,000
你好，苏茜。

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
How're you getting on with those
pups of yours?

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
你
和你的那些小狗相处得怎么样？

424
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,120
They're all grand.

424
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,120
他们都是伟大的。

425
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,240
First one you got out's
biggest of the lot.

425
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,240
第一个是你
最大的。

426
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
We named him James.

426
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
我们给他取名詹姆斯。

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
I'll have to come up and visit him.

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
我得上来拜访他。

428
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
Don't worry, Susie. Hey, we just
need to check how you're getting on.

428
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
别担心，苏茜。嘿，我们只
需要看看你过得怎么样。

429
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,440
BELL RINGS

429
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,440
铃响了

430
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Excuse me. Come on through.

430
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
打扰一下。来吧。

431
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Hi, Helen. Hi.

431
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
嗨，海伦。你好。

432
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,440
You look...

432
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,440
你看...

433
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,520
It's good to see you.

433
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,520
很高兴见到你。

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
Shall I come in?

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
我要进来吗？

435
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
Yes ,of course.

435
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
是的当然。

436
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm just finishing up, I won't be
long, I swear.

436
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
我刚刚完成，我不会
太久，我发誓。

437
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,280
She won't mind waiting.

437
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,280
她不介意等待。

438
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,920
Oh, hello.

438
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,920
哦你好。

439
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
Tea? I think so.

439
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
茶？我想是这样。

440
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Oh, you've certainly put
the weight back on.

440
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
哦，你肯定又把
重量放回去了。

441
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,280
Sorry, Susie.

441
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,280
对不起，苏茜。

442
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,200
That's very rude of me, isn't it?

442
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,200
这对我很粗鲁，不是吗？

443
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
You know, if ever you're to get
beyond smiling at the girl...

443
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
你知道，如果你要
超越对女孩的微笑......

444
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
..you might eventually have to do
something about it.

444
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
..你最终可能不得不为此做些
什么。

445
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,760
What happened to the other one?
What?

445
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,760
另一只怎么了？
什么？

446
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
I thought we could chat.

446
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
我以为我们可以聊天。

447
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,400
Um..

447
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,400
一..

448
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
..yeah, great, OK.

448
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
..是的，太好了，好的。

449
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,520
The other one, the barmaid,
Margaret?

449
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,520
另一个，酒保，
玛格丽特？

450
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,040
Maggie? I suppose she got sick of
you.

450
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,040
劣质煤？我猜她已经厌烦
你了。

451
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,440
Yeah, the thing about Maggie and me
is we're like ships in the night.

451
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,440
是的，关于玛吉和我的事情
是我们就像夜晚的船。

452
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,800
Travelling our own separate
courses...

452
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,800
旅行我们自己单独的
课程......

453
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
..occasionally we...

453
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
..偶尔我们...

454
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,840
..crash into one another during
stormy weather.

454
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,840
..在
暴风雨天气中相互碰撞。

455
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
Meanwhile, you happily flit...

455
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
与此同时，你快乐地飞过……

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,360
..courting one girl and then the
next.

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,360
..追求一个女孩，然后
下一个。

457
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
First of all - no-one courts.

457
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
首先- 没有人的法庭。

458
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,480
Then what are they doing?
They date.

458
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,480
那他们在做什么呢？
他们约会。

459
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
We're not Americans.

459
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
我们不是美国人。

460
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
The world's changing.

460
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
世界在变化。

461
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
Not every evening spent in the
company of a woman

461
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
不是每天晚上都在
女人的陪伴下度过

462
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,840
necessarily has to end in something
particularly meaningful.

462
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,840
必须以
特别有意义的事情结束。

463
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,520
In fact, most often it necessarily
doesn't.

463
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,520
事实上，大多数情况下不一定
。

464
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,120
Then what's the point of it all?

464
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,120
那么这一切的意义何在？

465
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,040
Fun.

465
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,040
乐趣。

466
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,360
I understand that's a very alien
concept to you.

466
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,360
我知道这
对你来说是一个非常陌生的概念。

467
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,680
I am fun, I'm perfectly bloody fun.

467
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,680
我很有趣，我非常有趣。

468
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
You certainly used to be.

468
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
你肯定曾经是。

469
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Now I don't know what's happened.
What's that supposed to mean?

469
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,080
现在我不知道发生了什么。
那是什么意思？

470
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
You didn't used to be like this.

470
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
你以前不是这样的。

471
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Like what?

471
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
像什么？

472
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
Allowing Merrick to get a free
ride...

472
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
让梅里克
搭便车……

473
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
..letting Pandhi rattle you and...

473
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
..让 Pandhi 让你和...

474
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,320
..don't even get me started on the
women.

474
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,320
..甚至不要让我开始谈论
女性。

475
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Well, I imagine the problem's
getting you to stop.

475
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
好吧，我想问题是
让你停下来。

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,880
There's no spirit, the fight's gone.

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,880
没有精神，战斗就结束了。

477
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,080
I assure you, it has not.
Really?

477
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,080
我向你保证，它没有。
真的吗？

478
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,960
Cos in the not too distant past,
you would've tackled that sow

478
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,960
因为在不久的过去，
你会对付那头母猪

479
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
without a moment's hesitation,

479
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
毫不犹豫，

480
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
just to show people that you could.

480
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
只是为了向人们展示你可以。

481
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm not saying you're past it but...
You just did!

481
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
我不是说你已经过去了，但是......
你刚刚做到了！

482
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
Stuck in a rut maybe, one that I
thought Dorothy

482
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
也许陷入了一种常规，我
认为多萝西

483
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
had got you out of it but...

483
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
已经让你摆脱它但是......

484
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm not in a rut, there is no bloody
rut!

484
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
我没有在车辙，没有血腥的
车辙！

485
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Oh, I'll get that for you.

485
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
哦，我给你拿。

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Bye. Bye.

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
再见。再见。

487
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,320
Good evening, good evening, Mrs
Hall, Helen, a delight as ever.

487
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,320
晚上好，晚上好，
霍尔夫人，海伦，一如既往的快乐。

488
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
What happened to you?

488
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
你怎么了？

489
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Fight with a pig.

489
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
与猪打架。

490
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Is it hard to believe
I actually won?

490
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,040
很难相信
我真的赢了吗？

491
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,720
Bring your muddy things down,

491
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,720
把你的泥泞的东西放下，

492
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,920
don't leave them festering on the
floor.

492
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,920
不要让它们在
地板上溃烂。

493
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
It's been a long day.

493
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
这是漫长的一天。

494
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
You must barely recognise me.

494
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
你肯定差点没认出我来。

495
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,480
Oh, I don't know Siegfried,

495
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,480
哦，我不认识齐格弗里德，

496
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,680
I think you've weathered rather
well.

496
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,680
我认为你已经
过得很好。

497
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
You're very kind.

497
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
你好亲切。

498
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
How've you been?

498
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
最近怎么样？

499
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,040
You know, one foot in front of the
other.

499
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,040
你知道，一只脚在另一只脚前面
。

500
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
Glad to hear it.

500
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
听到那个消息很开心。

501
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
There you are, James.

501
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
你来了，詹姆斯。

502
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,920
About bloody time, poor Helen's
being bored silly waiting.

502
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,920
差不多该死的时候了，可怜的海伦
正在无聊地等待。

503
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm fine, Mrs Hall's been looking
after me.

503
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,120
我很好，霍尔太太一直在照顾
我。

504
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
I had an emergency case,

504
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
我有一个紧急情况，

505
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
I've been playing catch up all day.

505
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
我一整天都在追赶。

506
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,280
You should really learn to deal
with these cases.

506
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,280
你真的应该学会处理
这些情况。

507
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,800
No wonder we're struggling
to turn a profit.

507
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,800
难怪我们正在努力
扭亏为盈。

508
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,080
I would say, Siegfried,
if Tristan were here today,

508
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,080
我会说，齐格弗里德，
如果特里斯坦今天在这里，

509
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,000
there would've been no need to
send anyone away.

509
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,000
没有必要
把任何人送走。

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,320
I want him with me until he's served
some time under my supervision.

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,320
我想让他和我在一起，直到他
在我的监督下服役一段时间。

511
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
He's more than capable.

511
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
他能力超群。

512
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh, see how they shower me with
praise?

512
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
哦，看看他们如何
赞美我？

513
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Perhaps this could wait for another
time?

513
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
也许这可以再等
一次？

514
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,200
No, if James has got something he
wants

514
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,200
不，如果詹姆斯有他
想要的东西

515
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
to get off his chest, I'd like to
hear it.

515
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
离开他的胸膛，我想
听听。

516
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,920
If Tristan were able to practise on
his own, we could take on more work.

516
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,920
如果特里斯坦能够自己练习
，我们可以承担更多的工作。

517
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,640
With the extra money, maybe we could
change a few things around here.

517
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,640
有了额外的钱，也许我们可以
改变这里的一些东西。

518
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
Change? Why on earth would
we want to change?

518
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
改变？
我们到底为什么要改变？

519
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,720
We could be working much more
efficiently,

519
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,720
我们可以更
有效地工作，

520
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
half of our equipment
is from the last century.

520
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
我们一半的设备
来自上个世纪。

521
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,920
So am I! Should we just toss me
out as well?

521
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,920
我也是！我们也应该把我扔
出去吗？

522
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't think James means that.

522
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
我不认为詹姆斯是这个意思。

523
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Of course I don't.

523
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
我当然不知道。

524
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
Siegfried, I learned more from you
in a year

524
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
齐格弗里德，
一年之内我从你身上学到了更多

525
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
than I did in all the time I spent
at college.

525
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
比我
在大学里度过的所有时间都多。

526
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,520
You flatter to deceive.

526
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,520
你受宠若惊。

527
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,000
It's true...

527
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,000
这是真的...

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
..he told me as much before.

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
..他以前也跟我说过。

529
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,760
I just want to be able to offer the
best care possible to our patients.

529
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,760
我只是希望能够
为我们的患者提供最好的护理。

530
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Of course, as do I.

530
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
当然，我也是。

531
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800
You know I'm always open to new
ideas.

531
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800
你知道我总是乐于接受新
想法。

532
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
HE CHUCKLES

532
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
他笑了

533
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
What?

533
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
什么？

534
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
I am.

534
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
我是。

535
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,640
Did you know we were the first
practice in whole of Yorkshire

535
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,640
你知道我们是
整个约克郡的第一家诊所吗？

536
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
to have our own centrifuge for TB
testing?

536
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
拥有我们自己的离心机进行结核病
检测？

537
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,600
And I always put us forward
for the trial of new medications.

537
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,600
我总是建议我们
试用新药。

538
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,160
We are a forward looking practice.

538
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,160
我们是一个前瞻性的实践。

539
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,400
And I am one who always looks ahead,
rather than behind - always.

539
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,400
我是一个总是向前看，
而不是向后看的人——总是。

540
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,240
Semper progrediens!

540
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,240
一直在进步！

541
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
Always progressing. I know.

541
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
一直在进步。我知道。

542
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,240
Good. Well, that all seems settled
then.

542
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,240
好的。那么，一切似乎都解决了
。

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,440
Now, shouldn't you be going before
something or other

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,440
现在，你不应该在
某事或其他事情之前走吗？

544
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
turns into a pumpkin?

544
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
变成南瓜？

545
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Semper progrediens!

545
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,760
一直在进步！

546
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,800
I believe he's fighting the
inevitable march of time.

546
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,800
我相信他正在与
不可避免的时间流逝作斗争。

547
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
Oh, Lord help us.

547
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
哦，求主帮助我们。

548
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
Go on, get on with you, I've my book
to read.

548
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
继续，继续，我有我的书
要读。

549
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
James...

549
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
詹姆士...

550
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,640
..good luck.

550
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,640
..祝你好运。

551
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
You sure you won't come?

551
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
你确定不来？

552
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
Oh, it's not for me.

552
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
哦，这不适合我。

553
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,800
Listen to that, Jess.

553
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,800
听着，杰斯。

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
Isn't that wonderful?

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
那是不是很美妙？

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
You'll be fine.

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
你会没事的。

556
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,520
Dorothy happen to mention
when she'll be returning?

556
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,520
多萝西碰巧提到
她什么时候回来？

557
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,320
She has no plans at the moment.

557
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,320
她目前没有任何计划。

558
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Oh, and how do you feel about that?

558
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
哦，你怎么看？

559
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,520
How do I feel?

559
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,520
我感觉如何？

560
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,320
When you care about someone very
much, you...

560
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,320
当你很在乎一个人的
时候，你...

561
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,960
People have these things,
feelings, emotions.

561
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,960
人们有这些东西、
感觉、情绪。

562
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,280
Dorothy's a good friend - nothing
more.

562
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,280
多萝西是个好朋友——仅此而已
。

563
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,400
Understood.

563
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,400
明白了。

564
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
Well, then...

564
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
好吧...

565
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,880
..without fear...

565
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,880
……无所畏惧……

566
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
There can be no courage.

566
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
不可能没有勇气。

567
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Once more unto the breach.

567
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
再一次突破。

568
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
Diana.

568
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
戴安娜。

569
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
Good evening. Good evening to
you.

569
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
晚上好。晚上好
。

570
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
You're looking stunning. Thank you.

570
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
你看起来很迷人。谢谢你。

571
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,000
How many do you think he'll
dance with tonight?

571
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,000
你认为他
今晚会和多少人跳舞？

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,680
I've a feeling that once she gets a
hold of him...

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,680
我有一种感觉，一旦她
抓住他...

573
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,040
..she won't be letting go.

573
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,040
..她不会放手的。

574
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,960
My mum used to make me
go to tea dances with her.

574
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,960
我妈妈过去常常让我
和她一起去跳茶舞。

575
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,440
It used to be me and a room full of
old ladies.

575
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,440
曾经是我和一个满屋子
老太太的房间。

576
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,400
Mum used to make me stand up in
front of all of them

576
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,400
妈妈曾经让我在
他们所有人面前站起来

577
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
and request songs from the singer.

577
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
并向歌手索取歌曲。

578
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,200
She didn't? I had to dance with
her...

578
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,200
她没有？我不得不和
她跳舞...

579
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,680
..and all her friends.

579
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,680
..还有她所有的朋友。

580
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,360
That's why I find it the most
embarrassing

580
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,360
所以我觉得最
尴尬

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
thing in the world to do.

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
世界上要做的事情。

582
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,920
It's probably why I'm terrible at
it.

582
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,920
这可能就是为什么我不擅长这个的原因
。

583
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
Oh, James, stop it.

583
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
哦，詹姆斯，别说了。

584
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
You're just saying it to make me
feel better.

584
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
你这么说只是为了让我
好受些。

585
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,880
So, I apologise in advance for the
absolute shambles

585
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,880
所以，我为
绝对的混乱提前道歉

586
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
this'll inevitably be

586
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
这将不可避免地

587
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
but would you like to dance?

587
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
但是你想跳舞吗？

588
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,560
I promise once people see me
out there,

588
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,560
我保证一旦人们看到我
在那里，

589
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,400
no-one is going to be talking
about your wedding with Hugh.

589
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,400
没有人会谈论
你和休的婚礼。

590
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
You'd really do that?

590
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
你真的会这样做吗？

591
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,200
You'd make a complete fool out of
yourself for me?

591
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,200
你会
为了我把自己变成一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜吗？

592
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
Every single day.

592
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
每一天。

593
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
No Maggie tonight, then?

593
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
那么今晚没有玛姬吗？

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,760
No, no, boyfriend. Her, not me.

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,760
不，不，男朋友。她，不是我。

595
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
That were very clever of you,

595
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
你真是太聪明了，

596
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,520
tricking that pig in to bursting its
own bubble.

596
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,520
诱使那头猪破灭它
自己的泡沫。

597
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,760
There'd be some who'd mistake
it for you running away.

597
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,760
有些人会误
以为你逃跑了。

598
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes, well, it often takes brains
as well

598
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
是啊，它往往需要大脑
以及

599
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,680
as brawn to solve these problems.

599
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,680
作为解决这些问题的强者。

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,840
Hm, I'd settle for a pretty face.

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,840
嗯，我会满足于一张漂亮的脸蛋。

601
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,480
How about it, then?

601
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,480
那怎么办？

602
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, sadly, Anabel, I'm just not
one of life's dancers.

602
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,760
哦，可悲的是，安娜贝尔，我只是不是
生活中的舞者之一。

603
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,600
Oh, that's handy...

603
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,600
哦，这很方便...

604
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
..because I'm not one for dancing
either.

604
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
..因为我也不适合跳舞
。

605
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
Outstanding.

605
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
杰出的。

606
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
I've no idea what I'm doing.

606
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
我不知道我在做什么。

607
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
Don't worry, you're doing fine.

607
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
别担心，你做得很好。

608
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
Ooh. Sorry.

608
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
哦。对不起。

609
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,560
It's alright, I've got another one.

609
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,560
没关系，我还有一个。

610
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,520
Look, try and loosen up, let
yourself go with it.

610
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,520
看，试着放松，让
自己随心所欲。

611
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,040
That's it, that's better.

611
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,040
就是这样，这样更好。

612
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,720
Ooh!

612
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,720
哦！

613
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,480
That's a little too much.

613
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,480
这有点过分了。

614
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
I was sorry to hear about you
and your husband.

614
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
听到你
和你丈夫的事，我很难过。

615
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Which was it, the housekeeper or the
gardener?

615
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
是管家还是
园丁？

616
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh, I don't hold for such
tittle-tattle.

616
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,920
哦，我不喜欢这种
八卦。

617
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
Both, actually.

617
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
两者，实际上。

618
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
I wouldn't blame him if it was the
gardener - he was quite the dish.

618
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
如果是
园丁，我不会责怪他——他是个菜。

619
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,600
There's even one going round

619
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,600
甚至还有一轮

620
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
where I've got old Len buried in the
basement.

620
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
我把老伦埋在
地下室的地方。

621
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,360
That's why no-one's seen him
for so long.

621
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,360
这就是为什么
这么久没有人看到他的原因。

622
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,880
I don't mind that one so much,

622
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,880
我不太介意那个，

623
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
it keeps everybody on their toes.

623
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
它让每个人都保持警觉。

624
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,960
Farnon, we've got ourselves a bit of
a problem.

624
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,960
法农，我们自己有点
问题。

625
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, Colonel, I believe we have.

625
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,520
是的，上校，我相信我们有。

626
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,560
I was in the middle of a charming
conversation with

626
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,560
我正在
与

627
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,840
this young lady and I've been rudely
interrupted.

627
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,840
这位小姐和我被粗鲁地
打断了。

628
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,280
I beg your pardon?

628
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,280
请再说一遍？

629
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
You can beg all you like,
you're not having it.

629
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
你可以随心所欲地乞求，
但你没有得到。

630
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Now, if you'll excuse me.

630
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
现在，如果你能原谅我。

631
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
You see, Colonel, what did I tell
you?

631
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
你看，上校，我跟
你说了什么？

632
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
He's lost it.

632
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
他失去了它。

633
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,640
I do apologise, Diana.

633
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,640
我真的很抱歉，戴安娜。

634
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,280
Oh, no need.

634
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,280
哦，没必要。

635
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,200
I love a bit of drama.

635
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,200
我喜欢一点戏剧。

636
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,760
Now hear this, Farnon, that cow is
still unwell.

636
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,760
现在听到这个，法农，那头牛
仍然不舒服。

637
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,120
You told me it needed an operation.

637
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,120
你告诉我它需要手术。

638
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
If you're not willing to come up
and sort her...

638
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
如果你不愿意上来给
她分类……

639
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
..well, I can always take my custom
elsewhere.

639
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
..好吧，我总是可以
在别处采取我的习惯。

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Custom suggests a transfer of money
for services rendered.

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,400
海关建议
为提供的服务转移资金。

641
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,560
I put a lot of work your way.

641
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,560
我按照你的方式做了很多工作。

642
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,480
Because we're the finest in the
district.

642
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,480
因为我们是这个地区最好的
。

643
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,720
We've three qualified vets and
enough work

643
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,720
我们有三名合格的兽医和
足够的工作

644
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,560
to necessitate the expansion of our
practice.

644
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,560
有必要扩大我们的
实践。

645
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,280
We don't have to fight like jackals
over scraps left by others.

645
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,280
我们不必像豺狼一样
为别人留下的碎片而战。

646
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,440
If you really want the best possible
care for your animals,

646
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,440
如果您真的想
为您的动物提供最好的照顾，

647
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,880
you can call during our normal
business hours.

647
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,880
您可以在我们正常
工作时间内致电。

648
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,560
Otherwise, go with the reserve team.

648
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,560
否则，去预备队。

649
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,520
Good evening.

649
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,520
晚上好。

650
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,280
Good evening? I'll give you good
evening!

650
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,280
晚上好？我给你说
晚安！

651
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,120
That was very impressive.
Thank you.

651
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,120
那是非常令人印象深刻的。
谢谢你。

652
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,560
Where are we going?

652
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,560
我们去哪？

653
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
No idea, I always like to sweep
out at the end of an argument.

653
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
不知道，我总是喜欢
在争论结束时扫地。

654
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,840
But since we're on the move, might I
suggest somewhere more salubrious?

654
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,840
但既然我们在移动，我可以
建议一个更有益的地方吗？

655
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
The Renniston, perhaps? Why not?

655
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
也许是雷尼斯顿？为什么不？

656
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,240
Sorry again about your toes.

656
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,240
再次为你的脚趾感到抱歉。

657
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Oh, it was great.

657
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
哦，太棒了。

658
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,600
You were great.

658
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,600
你很棒。

659
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,240
It's been so long since...

659
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,240
过了这么久...

660
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,640
I really needed that.

660
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,640
我真的需要那个。

661
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm glad.

661
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
我很高兴。

662
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,440
I'll, er, I'll fetch our drinks.

662
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,440
我去，呃，我去拿我们的饮料。

663
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,120
Don't forget to come up for air.

663
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,120
别忘了上来呼吸一下。

664
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Goodnight, Tristan.

664
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
晚安，特里斯坦。

665
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,680
Helen, been awhile. How've you been?

665
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,680
海伦，好久不见。最近怎么样？

666
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, not bad. You?

666
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
是的，还不错。你？

667
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
Oh, same as always...

667
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
哦，一如既往...

668
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,600
What do you say then, lass,
Fancy a turn around the floor?

668
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,600
那你怎么说，姑娘，想
在地板上转一圈吗？

669
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,760
Oh, Fernley, this is... Hello.

669
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,760
哦，芬利，这是……你好。

670
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm James Herriot.

670
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
我是詹姆斯·赫里奥特。

671
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
Right, nice.

671
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
对，不错。

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
抱歉。

673
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,200
I didn't mean to... If you two are
together, then.

673
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,200
我不是故意的……如果你们两个
在一起，那么。

674
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Us? Oh, no, we're not.

674
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
我们？哦，不，我们不是。

675
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,360
Are we? No, not at all.

675
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,360
我们是吗？一点都不。

676
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
Only, we were known to have the odd
dance in the past.

676
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
只是，我们知道
过去有奇怪的舞蹈。

677
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
We even won a show together.

677
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
我们甚至一起赢得了一场表演。

678
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,400
Go on, at least he won't stand on
your toes.

678
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,400
继续，至少他不会站在
你的脚趾上。

679
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
Right.

679
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
对。

680
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,120
Really, no trouble.

680
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,120
真的，没毛病。

681
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
Enjoy yourself.

681
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
玩的开心。

682
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Thanks, James.

682
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
谢谢，詹姆斯。

683
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,520
Idiot.

683
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,520
笨蛋。

684
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
Tea, Siegfried?

684
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
茶，齐格弗里德？

685
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,880
If you wouldn't mind, Tristan,

685
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,880
如果你不介意，特里斯坦，

686
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,800
thank you, very kind.

686
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,800
谢谢，很亲切。

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320
When. Bless you.

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320
什么时候。祝福你。

688
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,920
Good evening? Oh, very much so.

688
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,920
晚上好？哦，非常如此。

689
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
How long's this going to go on for?
What?

689
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
这要持续多久？
什么？

690
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,640
The inane expressions...

690
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,640
无语的表情...

691
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
..the smug sense of satisfaction.

691
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
..自鸣得意的满足感。

692
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,320
Mrs Hall, I would've thought
you'd be glad

692
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,320
霍尔夫人，我以为
你会很高兴

693
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
to hear we enjoyed ourselves last
night.

693
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
听说我们
昨晚玩得很开心。

694
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,440
Oh, it's enough to put me off my
breakfast.

694
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,440
哦，这足以让我
不吃早餐了。

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,920
What about James?

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,920
詹姆斯呢？

696
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,720
Did he enjoy himself?

696
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,720
他自己玩得开心吗？

697
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,400
PHONE RINGS

697
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,400
电话铃声

698
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
Darrowby, two, two, nine, seven.

698
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
达罗比，二，二，九，七。

699
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
One moment.

699
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
一会。

700
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
Mr Farnon.

700
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
法农先生。

701
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
Colonel Merrick.

701
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
梅里克上校。

702
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes, what, is it?

702
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,760
是的，这是什么？

703
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,160
Oh, you do?

703
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,160
哦，你呢？

704
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,240
Yes, well, I'll have to consult our
appointment diary first.

704
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,240
是的，好吧，我得先查阅一下我们的
约会日记。

705
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Three o'clock?

705
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
三点钟？

706
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
Breakfast's on the table.

706
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
早餐在桌上。

707
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,720
I'll be there in a minute.

707
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,720
我马上就到。

708
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,760
SIEGFRIED: See you then.

708
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,760
西格瑞德：到时候见。

709
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,040
How'd it go?

709
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,040
过得怎么样？

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,680
He's doing all right, temperature's
down.

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,680
他一切正常，温度
下降了。

711
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,000
The infection is starting
to clear up.

711
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,000
感染开始
好转。

712
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,320
You can call Mr Hammond and tell him
to pick him up later.

712
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,320
你可以打电话给哈蒙德先生，让他
稍后来接他。

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
That's not what I meant.

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
那并非我的本意。

714
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Oh, love.

714
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,080
哦，爱。

715
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
It's alright.

715
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
没关系。

716
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,120
There are a lot of people Helen
needs to catch up with.

716
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,120
海伦
需要赶上很多人。

717
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
SIEGFRIED: Herriot!

717
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
西格瑞德：赫里奥特！

718
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,080
Tristan!

718
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,080
特里斯坦！

719
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm literally three feet away from
you.

719
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,320
我真的离
你三英尺远。

720
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't understand why you
have to bellow.

720
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,000
我不明白你为什么
要吼叫。

721
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Don't be such a sensitive Sidney.
Here.

721
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
不要这么敏感的西德尼。
这里。

722
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I've been keeping these back, one
each.

722
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
我一直在保留这些，一个
一个。

723
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,960
And what are these for?

723
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,960
而这些是干什么用的？

724
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,840
You said you wanted us to modernise,
James?

724
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,840
你说你想让我们现代化，
詹姆斯？

725
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,120
We're about to give the good Colonel
a show he'll never forget.

725
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,120
我们要给这位优秀的上校
表演一场他永远不会忘记的表演。

726
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,720
Morning, Colonel.

726
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,720
早上好，上校。

727
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,880
No Pandhi today?

727
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,880
今天没有潘迪？

728
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,440
You're our vet, Farnon, for now, at
any rate.

728
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,440
无论如何，你现在是我们的兽医，法农。

729
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,440
Well, I'm glad we managed to squeeze
you in.

729
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,440
好吧，我很高兴我们能把
你挤进去。

730
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Yes, prepare the patient
for the operation.

730
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,920
是的，让患者做好手术准备
。

731
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
COW MOOS

731
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
牛摩丝

732
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
Thank you.

732
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
谢谢你。

733
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
Right. This is where we go in.

733
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
对。这是我们进去的地方。

734
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
I hope you aren't squeamish,
it's not for the faint hearted.

734
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
我希望你不要娇气，
这不适合胆小的人。

735
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
I've seen blood before, you needn't
worry, I shan't faint.

735
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
我以前见过血，你不用
担心，我不会晕倒的。

736
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,920
Now, you see the rumen exposed,
the cow's first stomach,

736
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,920
现在，你看到瘤胃暴露了，
牛的第一个胃，

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,840
you know they have four?

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,840
你知道他们有四个吗？

738
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,680
Hang on Farnon, that doesn't look
too clever.

738
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,680
等等 Farnon，这看起来
不太聪明。

739
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,520
Um, yes, it's probably just
a bit of ruminal gas.

739
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,520
嗯，是的，它可能只是
一点瘤胃气体。

740
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,600
Wouldn't you say?

740
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,600
你不说吗？

741
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,080
Aye, probably.

741
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,080
是的，大概。

742
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,200
James, could I borrow you for a
second?

742
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,200
詹姆斯，我能借你一下
吗？

743
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,640
Farnon, what was it you said,
the finest vet in the district?

743
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,640
法农，你说什么，
区里最好的兽医？

744
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,360
You're putting on a right show, now.

744
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,360
你现在正在上一场正确的表演。

745
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
Siegfried, do you not think
the good Colonel could

745
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
齐格弗里德，你认为
好上校不会

746
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,840
benefit from seeing some of your
handiwork up close?

746
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,840
从
近距离观看您的一些手工艺品中受益？

747
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,280
You know, you really are full
of good ideas at the moment, James.

747
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,280
你知道吗
，詹姆斯，你现在真的满脑子都是好主意。

748
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Yes, Colonel, come in.

748
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
是的，上校，进来。

749
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,200
Come in, that's it.

749
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,200
进来，就这样。

750
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,800
That's it, a little closer.

750
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,800
就这样，再近一点。

751
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
Scalpel, please.

751
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
请用手术刀。

752
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,640
There we are. Thank you.

752
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,640
我们到了。谢谢你。

753
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,000
Ready, Colonel?

753
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,000
准备好了吗，上校？

754
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,840
Oh, get on with it, Farnon.

754
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,840
哦，继续吧，法农。

755
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,880
Oh, oh.

755
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,880
哦，哦。

756
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,000
COLONEL MERRICK: Absolutely...

756
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,000
梅里克上校：绝对……

757
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,480
That's what the problem was. What do
you make of that?

757
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,480
这就是问题所在。你怎么看
？

758
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,240
Farnon, what the...
It's Mr Farnon...

758
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,240
法农，这是什么……
法农先生……

759
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,120
..and my bill will be in the post.

759
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,120
..我的帐单会在邮局里。

760
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,720
Well, I thought that went rather
well. Mm.

760
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,720
好吧，我认为这进行得相当
顺利。毫米。

761
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,160
Absolutely. Quite the show.
Text book.

761
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,160
绝对地。相当的表演。
课本。

762
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,840
COLONEL MERRICK: God, absolutely
covered in the stuff.

762
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,840
梅里克上校：天啊，完全
被这些东西覆盖了。

763
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
You'll have to keep him inside for a
few days

763
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
你得把他关在里面
几天

764
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,720
to keep the wound clean.

764
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,720
以保持伤口清洁。

765
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,960
But I'm pleased with how the
infection is clearing up.

765
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,960
但我对
感染的清除情况感到满意。

766
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,440
Well, we can't thank you enough,
Mr Herriot.

766
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,440
好吧，我们对你的感激不尽，
赫里奥特先生。

767
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,000
No trouble at all.

767
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,000
一点都不麻烦。

768
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
Mrs Hall will show you out.

768
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
霍尔太太会带你出去的。

769
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,920
Come on, then, Rock, here we go.

769
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,920
来吧，Rock，我们开始吧。

770
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,440
It looks like these two have
become firm friends.

770
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,440
看来两人已经
成为了好朋友。

771
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,840
Oh, we'll be sorry to see him go.
Won't we, Jess?

771
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,840
哦，我们会很遗憾看到他离开。
我们不会吗，杰斯？

772
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm sure they could see each other
again.

772
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,040
我相信他们可以
再次见面。

773
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
We could take them for a walk
together.

773
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
我们可以带他们
一起散步。

774
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,480
One of the men usually take Jess
out.

774
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,480
其中一名男子通常会带杰斯
出去。

775
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,840
Ah, well, never mind.

775
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,840
啊，好吧，别介意。

776
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,680
Maybe we'll see you out
and about, hey, Jess.

776
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,680
也许我们会在外面见你
，嘿，杰斯。

777
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
When you grow tired of moving
your clock forward,

777
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
当你厌倦了
让时钟向前移动时，

778
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,120
let me know and I'll come fix it.

778
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,120
让我知道，我会来解决它。

779
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
Lost time is never found again.

779
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
失去的时间再也找不回来了。

780
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
Come on, Rock, let's go.

780
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
来吧，洛克，我们走吧。

781
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,040
Oh, hold on.

781
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,040
哦，等一下。

782
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,640
Oh, Helen, love, good to see you.

782
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,640
哦，海伦，亲爱的，很高兴见到你。

783
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,800
Is James about?

783
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,800
詹姆斯约吗？

784
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,680
In there.

784
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,680
在那里。

785
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
Come in.

785
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
进来吧。

786
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm just clearing up, won't be a
second.

786
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,480
我正在清理，不会一
秒钟。

787
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
Sorry we lost each other last night.

787
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
对不起，我们昨晚失去了彼此。

788
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
Oh, it's fine, don't worry.

788
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
哦，没关系，别担心。

789
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,960
It's been so long since I caught up
with everyone.

789
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,960
我已经很久没有赶上
大家了。

790
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,360
I've known most of them since we
were kids.

790
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,360
我从小就认识他们中的大多数
。

791
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,080
Oh, it's all right, I understand.

791
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,080
哦，没关系，我明白了。

792
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,080
It was the same for me when I went
home, seeing everyone again.

792
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,080
当我
回到家时，我也是如此，再次见到大家。

793
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,720
It feels strange hearing you call
somewhere else home.

793
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,720
听到你打电话给
别处的家感觉很奇怪。

794
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,320
You belong here.

794
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,320
你属于这里。

795
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,000
This is your home.

795
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,000
这是你的家。

796
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,560
I looked for you last night,
couldn't find you?

796
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,560
昨晚
找你了，没找到？

797
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,320
I got dragged into a conversation
outside

797
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,320
我被拖进了
外面的谈话

798
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,000
with Gene Gilbert and
Mr Summers.

798
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,000
吉恩·吉尔伯特和
萨默斯先生。

799
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Once they get their teeth in,
they're hard to shake off.

799
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,800
一旦他们咬牙切齿，
就很难摆脱。

800
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
I would've liked to have danced with
you again.

800
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
我很想
再和你跳舞。

801
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,040
If your toes could take it.

801
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,040
如果你的脚趾可以承受。

802
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Last night were the first time in a
long time

802
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
昨晚是
很久以来的第一次

803
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,120
that I've felt like myself again...

803
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,120
我又感觉像我自己了……

804
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
..and I was only there because of
you.

804
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
..而我只是因为
你而在那里。

805
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,760
Everything all right with
Miss Alderson?

805
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,760
奥尔德森小姐一切都好吗？

806
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,400
Aye, grand.

806
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,400
是的，伟大的。

807
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
Everything's grand.

807
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
一切都是伟大的。
