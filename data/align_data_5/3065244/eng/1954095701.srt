1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on "The originals"

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,650
This town was my home once. I want it back.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,370
I want you to help me take new orleans

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,980
from under all of their noses,

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,210
and I have someone on the inside.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,850
I need something from you

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,710
So that the witches can
complete the harvest.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,690
I need to consecrate the
remains of a powerful witch.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,070
Her name is Celeste Dubois.

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,780
You and she have a friend in common.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,840
Elijah.

12
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,220
The harvest is incomplete,

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,620
and if they don't finish it, it's over.

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,970
All our power will drain away.

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,680
Our magic fades.

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,230
Accept this offering as
a sign of our faith.

17
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,260
Every girl who died

18
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,010
released her power onto the next.

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,980
When I was the last one,

20
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,140
I suddenly had all of it.

21
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,800
An artist, huh? That's cool.

22
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,450
These drawings, what are they?

23
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,610
She called them evil.

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,400
Oh, my god.

25
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,200
Hello, Celeste.

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,770
The italians call them strega.

27
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,690
The Yoruba of west Africa call them aje,

28
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,660
meaning mother.

29
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,060
Where my mother as from,
they called them hexa,

30
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,920
and here we call them witch.

31
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,120
Over the centuries,
vampires have fought them

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,490
and fought beside them,

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,360
bedded them and burned them.

34
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,900
Whether adversary or ally,

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,040
and they have been a force
to be reckoned with.

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,360
Their ancestral magic anchors this city.

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,800
There's never been one all-powerful witch

38
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,090
until Davina.

39
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,380
Who is now tucked in

40
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,980
safe and sound down the
hall under my protection.

41
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,520
Your Celeste was quite beautiful

42
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,140
and a portent of evil according

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,400
to our volatile artist in residence.

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,870
Yes. Perhaps Davina's mistaken

45
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,390
what she calls evil for power.

46
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,150
Celeste was certainly
very powerful in her day,

47
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,820
but she's been dead for over 200 years.

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,140
I don't understand why
all these sketches now.

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,700
Why does any witch do anything?

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,250
Go away!

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,240
Come on. You got to be starving.

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,040
You haven't eaten since--

53
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,810
since your best friend
killed my best friend?

54
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,850
Davina, I'm sorry about

55
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,130
what happened to this kid Tim.

56
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,410
I'm sorry you don't hate
Klaus for what he did

57
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,190
or want to make him pay.

58
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,060
He'll pay for

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,240
what he did one way or the other,

60
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,440
but right now, I just want
to make peace with you.

61
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,430
Why?

62
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,370
So we can be

63
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,110
one big happy frankenstein family?

64
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,870
Well, that's going well.

65
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,070
If you were trying to win the girl's trust,

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,050
perhaps poisoning her one true love

67
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,020
was not the most splendid idea.

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,210
Oh. Are there any more inopportune deaths

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,060
you'd like to wave in my face?

70
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,190
Give me a month.

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,940
I'll get you list.

72
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,580
Young, old, dead, or alive,

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,520
witches are a pain in the ass.

74
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,100
Davina, Davina!

75
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,770
What's with all the racket?

76
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,570
Bloody hell.

77
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,990
Elijah?

78
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,600
There's something you need to know.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,200
What the hell is going on?

80
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,300
Davina.

81
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,400
Hey. What kind of game do
you think you're playing?

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,960
I said disrupt the household,

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,370
not destroy the whole city.

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,510
I didn't do it.

85
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,130
Not on purpose.

86
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,800
I--I don't know what's wrong with me.

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,180
This is madness.

88
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,470
How can a 16-year-old girl

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,220
shake the entire French quarter?

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,350
I seen her rock the church,

91
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,900
but I've never seen anything like this.

92
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,870
How did you control her
when she was in the attic?

93
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,950
I didn't have to,

94
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,970
but then I never killed her boyfriend.

95
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,760
Yes, yes. We've been
over this part already.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,850
The point is in her present state

97
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,900
she's useless as a tool
against the witches.

98
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,980
She's not a tool.
Something's wrong with her.

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,900
She has too much power
that she cannot control.

100
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,150
that much we already knew.

101
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,080
But why is it manifesting itself

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,700
in such an aggressive manner?

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,150
Where are you going?

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,560
This is witch business.

105
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,830
Let's ask a witch.

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,690
You're going to see Sophie.

107
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,350
You don't have to eavesdrop.

108
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,900
I keep nothing from you.

109
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,440
Yeah. Well, I don't want to
keep anything from you either,

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,430
and if you're going out to see Sophie,

111
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,130
then there's something
that you should know.

112
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,900
She called me and asked me for a favor.

113
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,860
She promised me that she would help

114
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,770
break the curse that
Marcel put on my people

115
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,250
in exchange for some information.

116
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,400
And I didn't think anything of it,

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,480
but then Davina started doing
those pictures of Celeste--

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,650
Whatever this is,

119
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,970
you have to tell me.

120
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,000
Sophie wanted to find Celeste's remains,

121
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,510
so I...

122
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,970
went through your journals,

123
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,840
and I found out where you buried her,

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,220
and then I told her.

125
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,900
I know it was stupid and it was snoopy,

126
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,690
And I--I should have just asked you.

127
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
Please say something.

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,440
Please.

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,420
She wanted to be left in peace.

130
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,760
When a witch's remains are consecrated,

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,980
that power fuels the
rest of their community.

132
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,140
Celeste did not want her
remains to be found.

133
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,400
She made me promise to bury her

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,830
where she would not be found.

135
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,680
You not only violated my privacy,

136
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,280
You have broken my promise to her.

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,900
I thought they were just bones, Elijah.

138
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,220
If you truly believed that,

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,310
why didn't you ask me where to find her?

140
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,950
If that's dinner, I pass.

141
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,050
Sophie, where have you been?

142
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,450
Short answer-- grave robbing.

143
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,850
Stop whatever you're doing.

144
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,390
We need to find Davina.

145
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,810
I figured out a way to
complete the harvest.

146
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,910
What? How?

147
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,090
We need an elder to do it, right?

148
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,310
I figured out a way how to become one.

149
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,740
Soph, you can't just become an elder.

150
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,150
That power has to be bestowed upon you

151
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,920
by the other elders, all of whom are dead.

152
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,460
Following my logic?

153
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,910
How about follow your history?

154
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,900
I did research.

155
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,150
In 1742,

156
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,310
there was a witch massacre

157
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,920
that wiped out all the elders,

158
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
so they decided whoever consecrated
the most powerful dead witch

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,750
in the community became an elder.

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
It worked for them.

161
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,950
Teeny flaw.

162
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,010
What powerful witch is
even left for you to bury?

163
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,840
Meet Celeste Marie-Heline dubois,

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,370
Elijah Mikaelson's old lover.

165
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,970
She was drowned in 1821 for being a witch.

166
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,620
He buried her, never told anyone where.

167
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,730
So how the hell did you find her?

168
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,950
I bribed Hayley to read his journals,

169
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,890
and then I dug her ass up

170
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,610
So I could consecrate her bones

171
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,250
and absorb her power.

172
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,080
That's not disrespectful.

173
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,510
Yeah? Well, we only have
a couple more weeks

174
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,510
to complete the harvest.

175
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,000
Soph, I'm aware of our deadline, but--

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
And if we fail,

177
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,770
the witches are done for in this town.

178
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,010
Our power will fade for good.

179
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,870
Those girls sacrificed
will never resurrect.

180
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,250
My niece will never come back.

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,920
If digging up some creepy old
bones means i get Monique back,

182
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't care about anything else.

183
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,150
I happen to care.

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,300
You're coming with me.

185
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,940
So you have stolen the remains

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,580
of the very person that Davina's
been drawing for months.

187
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,310
Would you care to explain
this startling coincidence?

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,580
I can't. I didn't even know

189
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,690
who Celeste Dubois was until I--

190
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,260
Was that Davina?

191
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,330
Charming little habit she's developed.

192
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,030
And the earthquake I felt today?

193
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,290
Also Davina,

194
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,200
and she's taken to vomiting dirt.

195
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,700
Oh. We have a huge problem.

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
I thought that we had more time,

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,660
but we need to complete the harvest now.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,610
Said the desperate witch conveniently.

199
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm serious. That earthquake you just felt

200
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,580
a preview of the disaster movie
that is about to hit us.

201
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,020
Why should we believe you?

202
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,270
You've met Davina, you know her story,

203
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,830
For months now, she's been holding

204
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,170
all the power of the 3 girls sacrificed

205
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,320
in the harvest ritual,

206
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,460
A force that was meant to flow through her

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,960
and back into the earth.

208
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,870
One person was never meant
to hold that much power.

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,430
It's tearing her apart,

210
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,490
and it will take us down with it.

211
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,090
We need to prepare.

212
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,500
According to Sophie Deveraux,

213
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,660
as Davina self-destructs,

214
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,010
she'll cycle through 4 stages

215
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,290
that represent the 4 elements

216
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,850
that bound together the harvest.

217
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,390
- The earthquake? - Yes.

218
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,870
Earth stage comes first.

219
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,120
Then comes wind, and since each stage

220
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,390
is more intense than the last,

221
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,590
Let's just say you'll blow
the roof off this place.

222
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,320
The after the wind is water.

223
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,210
Rain, flood. How bad?

224
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,110
Quite bad actually,

225
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,070
but that's not the worst of it.

226
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,840
The last stage is fire,

227
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,060
and since it's the last...

228
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,320
It will be by far the worst.

229
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,480
But I didn't take over this town

230
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,070
to watch it burn to the ground.

231
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,040
You can stop this, right?

232
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,540
Yes, but you're not gonna like how.

233
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,220
They want to complete the harvest.

234
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,950
- No!
- The witches say you'll be resurrected.

235
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,300
They're liars!

236
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,310
They'll say anything to get what they want

237
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,420
Just like Marcel, just like you.

238
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,270
Davina, you may think that
I don't care about you,

239
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,380
but you're wrong.

240
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,450
I know what it's like to have
your life stripped away from you

241
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,050
because of other people's bad decisions.

242
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,670
How do you think I became a vampire?

243
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,980
You've convinced my siblings.

244
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,400
You have yet to convince us.

245
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,020
We don't have time to waste.

246
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,090
The first sign's already come and gone.

247
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,310
So fix her.

248
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,980
She can't be fixed.

249
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,640
What--what is that?

250
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
The more upset you become,

251
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,320
the faster you deteriorate.

252
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,410
I compelled up some sedative.

253
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,190
No, no, no!

254
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,020
We keep you calm,

255
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
we keep you alive Davina.

256
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,560
- Stop! - She can't be saved.

257
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,780
This will not stop at the earth sign,

258
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,280
and if you wait it out,

259
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,430
you immortals will be the only
ones left to argue about it.

260
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,790
No! Please!

261
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,750
No! Please!

262
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,170
Nooo!

263
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,630
Convinced now?

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,920
We sedated her too heavily.

265
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,270
Well, if this is her sedated,

266
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,790
I'd hate to see her otherwise.

267
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,990
We all agreed that Davina
must be sacrificed.

268
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,930
There's no need to let her
blow the roof off our heads

269
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,850
in the meantime.

270
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,600
No way! You're not touching her!

271
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,550
Ok. I'll let you have that one.

272
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,510
Marcel, no one wishes to
see Davina come to harm

273
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,370
less than I, but there is no scenario here

274
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,890
in which we simply wait this out.

275
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,160
She's going to die.

276
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,530
According to Sophie,

277
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,020
the witch who screwed over everybody here.

278
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,900
The harvest was working
before it was stopped.

279
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,550
If a nonbeliever like Sophie Deveraux

280
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,600
can come to have faith that these
girls will be resurrected,

281
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,900
then I, also, am a believer.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,330
I saved Davina from the harvest,

283
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,500
and now you want me to just hand her over?

284
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,450
Do you think that I'm happy about this?

285
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,080
If the witches complete the harvest,

286
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,640
not only do they regain their power.

287
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,110
We lose our weapon against them.

288
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,270
The earthquake I was willing to chalk up

289
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,430
to hideous coincidence,

290
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,680
but these winds?

291
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,030
If Davina is not sacrificed,

292
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,980
then every inch of earth that shook,

293
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,640
everything blowing about now

294
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,520
will soon be drenched in water

295
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,050
and consumed by fire.

296
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,110
Oh! Now you care about the city.

297
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,240
We ought to. We built it.

298
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,060
And we all saw it burnt
to the ground twice.

299
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,130
I will not let that happen again.

300
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,160
Do I make myself clear?

301
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,520
Yeah.

302
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,750
Yeah.

303
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,950
Not a people person, are you, Niklaus?

304
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,320
Nonsense. I love people.

305
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,770
Just on my way to warn a
couple of prominent ones

306
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,450
in case the weather gets out of hand.

307
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,600
If you fancy yourself as plus diplomatique,

308
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,900
perhaps you'd like to come along.

309
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,250
No. Soon Sophie Deveraux

310
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,100
shall be consecrating Celeste's remains,

311
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,790
and though her actions are reprehensible,

312
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,540
still I should pay my respects.

313
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,830
Hey. Do you have a minute?

314
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,960
Just on my way out.

315
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,670
Which one of us is the people person again?

316
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,090
Fat lot of good that will do.

317
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,520
I don't really have time to socialize.

318
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,610
Good. Neither do I.

319
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,080
When you're done burying your
witchy bits on sacred ground,

320
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,930
are you prepared to perform the harvest?

321
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,850
You do realize you have
to slit a girl's throat,

322
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,550
a very sweet girl as it turns out.

323
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,540
If it means I get my niece Monique back,

324
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,860
I can handle anything.

325
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,870
Why are you really here?

326
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,400
When all this is done,

327
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,180
after Davina is resurrected

328
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,660
and the witches get their power back,

329
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,020
You'll have a decision to make.

330
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,800
Enlighten me.

331
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,600
A witch at her full power
can trade body blows

332
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,110
with a vampire punch for punch.

333
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,560
Believe me, I know.

334
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,690
So do I.

335
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,320
Be nice to have a fair fight for a change.

336
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, fair only gets you so far, luv.

337
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,180
Clever gets you further.

338
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,540
After this, Marcel will still be here,

339
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,300
and so will Klaus,

340
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,910
and you know better than

341
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,640
anyone that those two don't fight fair.

342
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,950
You are going to need an
original on your side,

343
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,170
and I'm gonna need a witch on mine

344
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,930
if we're gonna stop those
two from running things.

345
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,890
Am I missing something?

346
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,340
Why would you side with me?

347
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,760
Sometimes, what's more important

348
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,390
is not who you're siding with

349
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,450
but who you're siding against.

350
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,870
No, no!

351
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,360
Let go of me! Stop it!

352
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,720
I got you. I got you right here.

353
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,690
Hey. Klaus said not to.

354
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,070
I'm done caring what Klaus says.

355
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,110
You don't have to be here for this.

356
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,440
It's gonna take some time

357
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,320
for Sophie to prepare for her consecration.

358
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,690
I have time.

359
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,190
I owe her this.

360
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,110
Care to elaborate why?

361
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
Have you ever experienced something

362
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,630
so...

363
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,420
profound and wonderful that
when it was taken from you

364
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,040
your life felt unbearable?

365
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,130
Yes, I have felt that,

366
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,460
and I've got the scars to prove it.

367
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,560
I believe that when you love someone

368
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,690
and that person loves you in return

369
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,220
you're uniquely vulnerable.

370
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,270
They have a power

371
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,090
to hurt you that's like nothing else.

372
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,370
Rebekah.

373
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,420
He's taken the girl.

374
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,510
Who has?

375
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,590
Bloody, bloody Marcel!

376
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,250
And you wanted to run off and start a life

377
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,390
with this back stabber.

378
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,960
Says the man who was shacking up with him

379
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,910
not two seconds before all this went down.

380
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,450
Ok. We need to divide and conquer

381
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,710
if we're gonna stand a chance.

382
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,870
He could have gone anywhere.

383
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,900
Well, I'm here with Sabine.

384
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,440
Perhaps we could try a locator spell?

385
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,410
I'll talk to the priest.

386
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,850
They might even be at the church.

387
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,720
It's the last place we'd think
to look for them, right?

388
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,680
Ok. You check the church,

389
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,450
I'll check... everywhere else.

390
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,260
What are you doing?

391
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,860
I was gonna take these to the...

392
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,150
If you say, "Bayou,"

393
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,630
I will find a nice comfy
dungeon and throw you in it.

394
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,080
This is not the night to be out there.

395
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,450
For anyone.

396
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,230
But some people don't have a choice.

397
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,130
Right.

398
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,880
Grab that lot and come with me.

399
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,590
I consecrate these bones to the earth.

400
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,120
Ancestors, hear me.

401
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,780
I consecrate these bones to the earth.

402
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,490
Ancestors, hear me.

403
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,530
This isn't working.

404
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,770
She's nowhere to be found.

405
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,650
No. It's more like she's everywhere.

406
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,920
She's hemorrhaging magic.

407
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,270
That means we have less
time than we thought.

408
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,260
We have got to find her.

409
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,960
I have no clue where she is.

410
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,020
Please concentrate.

411
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,470
Try again.

412
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm not gonna hurt you.

413
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,720
I don't believe you!

414
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,110
You want to kill me just
like everyone else.

415
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm the one who put a
protection spell on you, D.

416
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,670
That's why Tim's dead and you're not.

417
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,960
And before you throw me again,

418
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,560
if I had know anything was
gonna happen to your friend,

419
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,930
I would have protected him, too.

420
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,740
You're the one who saved me?

421
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,310
Yeah, but now the witch who did the spell

422
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,420
is in league with the rest of them,

423
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,400
so I had to take you away.

424
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,620
So you could use me as a weapon?

425
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,630
I'm trying to keep you safe.

426
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,770
Davina, look at me.

427
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
I messed up.

428
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,580
All this power that you have,

429
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,950
it gave me an advantage.

430
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,570
It helped me punish the witches,

431
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,730
and it let me run the city,

432
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,740
and I let that mean too much.

433
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,710
All right, but that's over with now.

434
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,480
One survivor to another,

435
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,970
all I want to do is keep
you alive, I swear.

436
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,170
I'm scared.

437
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,280
I don't know what's wrong with me.

438
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,740
You're not alone.

439
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,410
We'll fix this.

440
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,720
You won't let them hurt me?

441
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,390
No. Nobody's gonna touch you.

442
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,310
We still haven't gone through

443
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,380
all that you've already provided, Klaus.

444
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,830
Well, this newest bit isn't from me.

445
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,860
That's very kind of you.

446
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,870
Hayley.

447
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,430
And these people are?

448
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,950
I asked Father Kieran to give them shelter.

449
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,520
He suffers from an incessant
desire to do good.

450
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,700
But now I need you to be useful.

451
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,030
Marcel and Davina have disappeared.

452
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,710
I assume from the stupefied
look on your face

453
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,660
they haven't sought refuge in your attic.

454
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,020
No. Those days are gone.

455
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,470
Then energize your resources.

456
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,480
I don't need to remind you

457
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,570
how important it is they be found.

458
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,420
Yes.

459
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,670
These people, they're werewolves,

460
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,260
and the priest, he said
that you donated the food.

461
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,500
You're helping them?

462
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,780
They're not your werewolves.

463
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,120
They're my clan.

464
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,250
From very far back.

465
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,050
They've fallen upon hard times,

466
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,330
and their plight has brought out

467
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,010
the philanthropist in me.

468
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,880
What can I say?

469
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,320
Must be Elijah's influence.

470
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,250
What do you mean your clan?

471
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,590
The blood that runs in their veins

472
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,930
runs in mine.

473
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,790
And in our child's.

474
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,230
This family gets more
complicated by the second.

475
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,250
Listen, Hayley,

476
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,760
word of advice when dealing with Elijah.

477
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
Don't do as I do.

478
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,520
Just apologize.

479
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,580
He's accomplished in many things,

480
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,620
but he is a master of forgiveness.

481
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,780
Ok.

482
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,390
Oh, ok. She's somewhere near the river.

483
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,100
I can't be more specific.

484
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,830
It's something. It's a start.

485
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,950
It didn't work.

486
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,720
I tried to consecrate her

487
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,780
and absorb her magic,

488
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,010
but there's nothing there.

489
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,090
I don't understand.

490
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,510
A witch's magic is infused in her bones

491
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,930
until consecrated.

492
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,620
Well, then someone's already taken it

493
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,380
because there's nothing there.

494
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,830
Has to be another way.

495
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,270
There is no other way.

496
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,080
Unless you know of some superpowerful

497
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,890
dead which whose bones
were never consecrated,

498
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,420
it's over.

499
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,330
There is someone else actually.

500
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,790
My mother.

501
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,040
It's taken 1,000 years,

502
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,910
but you've finally gone mad.

503
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,970
Our own mother?

504
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,900
Yes, our beloved mother,

505
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,700
who Niklaus has

506
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,850
affectionately placed in a
coffin in his basement,

507
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,650
not daggered but quite dead.

508
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,750
Well, she did try to kill us all.

509
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,530
Well, I say we put her to
use and put her to rest

510
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,820
once and for all.

511
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,860
Now if we bury our mother on land owned

512
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,360
by one of her descendents,

513
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,220
she becomes a New Orleans witch,

514
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,780
and we as her family share
in that ancestral magic.

515
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,990
We're vampires, Elijah.

516
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,590
We can't practice magic

517
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,570
or own property for that matter.

518
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,040
Yes. With regard to practicing magic...

519
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,380
That's where I come in.

520
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,710
After they bury their mother,

521
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,550
They can channel all her power to me.

522
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,690
Only hitch is as conduits
of Esther's magic,

523
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,920
they need to participate in the harvest.

524
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,630
And as for owning property...

525
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,480
Not all of our mother's
descendents are dead.

526
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,830
The baby.

527
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,970
The baby.

528
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,550
The parish tax assessor's office

529
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,570
is just steps outside of the quarter.

530
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,680
Hayley now holds the
title to the plantation.

531
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,750
So if we bury our mother there

532
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,020
and we consecrate those grounds,

533
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,690
we can finish the harvest ritual.

534
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,590
You're a bit of a mad genius, Elijah.

535
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,330
Count me in.

536
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,350
Am I the only one thinking?

537
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,170
Our mother was the most
powerful witch in history.

538
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,760
If we bury her, we hand that power

539
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,520
to our enemies to use against us.

540
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,500
Given our circumstances,

541
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,660
I hardly see that we
have a choice, Rebekah.

542
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,520
I don't know why I bother.

543
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,420
You two will just do what you want anyway.

544
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,490
No. Our decision must be unanimous.

545
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,270
This is not a democracy.

546
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,490
You're quite right.

547
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,100
This is family.

548
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,750
Water. The next sign's begun. Rebekah?

549
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,570
Kill a demon today, face
the devil tomorrow.

550
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,530
Count me in.

551
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,400
Well, this is no family
reunion without our mother.

552
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,610
I'll fetch her.

553
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,070
So much for your grand schemes

554
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,660
of using Davina for revenge.

555
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,030
Survival first,

556
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,690
plots to overthrow my brother second.

557
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,940
Where would Marcel hide
something precious to him?

558
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,150
You think I'm just gonna offer that up

559
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,730
so you can leave me here to rot?

560
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,320
Water runs downhill.

561
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,740
You think I have to have drowned before

562
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,070
to know how much that will suck.

563
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,550
Fire kills vampires, Thierry.

564
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,800
You think burning to ash will be pleasant?

565
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,550
Look. I am not forsaking you.

566
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,140
I promise to live up to my end of the deal.

567
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,410
I'll get you out of here
when all of this is done.

568
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,630
Just tell me where Marcel would go.

569
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,310
There's a place by the docks.

570
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,630
If I can just wait it
out a few more weeks...

571
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,860
Help me, please.

572
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,710
I will, and when it's over,

573
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,580
I'll do what I should have done--

574
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,040
get you out of town.

575
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,440
I had a dream that Tim wasn't dead.

576
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,040
He played a song that he wrote for me,

577
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,350
and he kissed me,

578
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,010
and we were just normal.

579
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,820
That sounds like a beautiful dream.

580
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,220
What are you doing here?

581
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,560
But it was just a dream.

582
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,630
Get out!

583
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,100
This is killing her.

584
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,690
Your stubbornness will mean her death.

585
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,850
I promised her I'd fight for her.

586
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,030
I'm not breaking that promise.

587
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,060
No one is asking you not to fight.

588
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,430
You're the only family that this girl has.

589
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,330
You owe it to her to fight for her to live.

590
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,410
Did you find them?

591
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,700
Will he bring her?

592
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,550
He'll bring her.

593
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,810
Are you ready to do this?

594
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,250
Always and forever.

595
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,500
It's done.

596
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,020
Marcel, it's ok.

597
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,890
No. I failed you.

598
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,590
I'll die whether I do this or not.

599
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,080
I mean, now the only option is--

600
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,290
is whether I take everyone with me.

601
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,600
If you look at it that way,

602
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,830
it's kind of selfish not to do it.

603
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,310
There has to be another way.

604
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,190
This is not how it ends.

605
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,980
And if it is...

606
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,730
If this is all I have,

607
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,090
I've had a lot.

608
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,680
I had Monique, and I had Tim...

609
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,370
And I had someone who fought for me

610
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,460
from the moment you met me.

611
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,640
Ah, Davina.

612
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,340
Most people don't get that

613
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,610
even if they live to be 100.

614
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,780
Marcel, I'm ready.

615
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,920
Fire.

616
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,880
Do you believe in the harvest?

617
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,860
I believe.

618
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,160
After the harvest comes the reaping.

619
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,210
Their sacrifices made and accepted,

620
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,470
we call upon our elders

621
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,010
to resurrect your chosen ones.

622
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,690
We call upon our elders

623
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,380
to resurrect your chosen ones.

624
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,360
Resurrect your chosen ones.

625
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,410
Please.

626
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,090
I beg.

627
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,260
That won't bring her back, you know?

628
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,810
This is your fault.

629
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,200
I should have never let
you anywhere near her.

630
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,260
Marcel--

631
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,590
This city was fine before you came.

632
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,040
We were fine!

633
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,750
Davina was safe! She was in control!

634
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,300
If you hadn't gotten her worked up,

635
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,820
if you hadn't killed that boy!

636
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,780
My condolences the girl is gone,

637
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,170
but don't lose perspective.

638
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,500
We still have our community.

639
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,640
The vampires of this town--

640
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,340
I don't care about the vampires!

641
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,890
She is dead!

642
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,480
Do you hear me?

643
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,690
I'm sorry.

644
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,420
You may think I know nothing of your grief,

645
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,880
but you are wrong.

646
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,600
In the days after I fled this city,

647
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,810
I thought you were dead.

648
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,880
It was years before I could speak your name

649
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,000
so keenly did I feel that loss.

650
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,950
I'm sorry.

651
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,150
I'm--I'm sorry.

652
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,760
Are you ready to forgive me yet?

653
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,520
It's not that easy, Hayley.

654
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,330
Elijah, I was wrong to go
through your journals,

655
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,250
I was wrong to tell Sophie about Celeste,

656
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,820
but after everything that happened today,

657
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,400
I don't know why we can't see past this.

658
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,250
And you of all people should know why.

659
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,860
During my fever in the bayou,

660
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,920
you were inside my mind.

661
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,020
You know what Celeste means to me.

662
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,140
Don't you mean meant to you?

663
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,660
No. Do you have any idea how rare love is?

664
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,090
In a thousand years, I
have found it but twice,

665
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,520
and when I have, I have honored it.

666
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,120
I know what a promise means to you, Elijah,

667
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,310
but you made it 200 years ago.

668
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,960
I live in the now.

669
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,880
If I feel something,

670
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,730
I act.

671
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,830
If I want something, I take it.

672
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,870
I won't choose the dead over the living,

673
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,430
so why are you?

674
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,690
I'm sorry, Elijah.

675
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,390
This whole thing was doomed

676
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,040
from the start, you know?

677
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,640
Yes, we saved the city,

678
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,470
and I'm not complaining about the witches

679
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,690
losing their power,

680
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,390
but this did not go down the
way I thought it would.

681
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,750
You surprised me, though.

682
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,110
You were quite resourceful today.

683
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,690
How did you find them down at the docks?

684
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,900
You're not the only one
with clever little spies

685
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,260
in the quarter, Nik.

686
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,910
Sometimes I think I don't give
you your due, little sister.

687
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,750
I knew Elijah's plan was mad,

688
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,370
but I really thought it would work.

689
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,690
So did I.

690
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,580
I was sure Davina would survive.

691
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,040
There was so much life in her.

692
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,500
What about the power?

693
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,600
4 were supposed to rise, and none did.

694
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,800
Where did all that power go?

695
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,450
Why are we here?

696
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,190
Someone brought us forth.

697
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,680
Who?

698
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,760
I did.

699
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,030
Sabine! What's the meaning of this?

700
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,730
Bastiana, I've had to endure people

701
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,300
calling me "Sabine" for almost a year now.

702
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,000
I'd appreciate it if you'd call me

703
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
by my real name--

704
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,160
Celeste.
