1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,970
你在那畫什麼呢

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,570
一個假想的約束場 只有飛盤那麼大

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,590
用作連接平行宇宙的通道
也就是蟲洞

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,990
噢 你是蟲把腦子鑽了個洞吧

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,370
很多科學家相信接觸外星生物

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,310
對人類可能會造成惡果

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,680
這蟲洞只有飛盤大小  Leonard

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,570
用個飛盤就可以封住

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,520
所以請淡定

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,600
你還指望我造出這東西?

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,650
我指望你用它把下巴上的布丁擦乾淨

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,170
先生們再會

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,170
你們發現Sheldon總是在2點45就遁走嗎?

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,190
真的?

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,720
他大概只是去上趟廁所吧

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,730
那可不是 他每天早上8點去上廁所

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,840
只有週五的高纖維食品會產生
1點45和7點10分的附加排泄次數

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,380
你這都知道 真是太悲催了

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,300
哎 這只是傷心太平洋裡一滴水而已

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
我正在看他的公共日曆

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,840
2點45到3點05 啥也沒有

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,490
昨天 2點45到3點05 啥也沒有

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,580
上周 啥也沒有

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,210
上個月 啥也沒有

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,010
那段時間裡 他從來沒有任何計劃

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,820
一天裡的20分鐘 完全不知所蹤

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
我們得弄清楚他去了哪兒

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,600
喔 太激動了

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,410
跟我舉辦的謀殺推理餐會一樣刺激

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,180
是啊 誰謀殺了我人生中的
三個週六夜晚的那案子哈?

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,510
Koothrapali上校在廚房
用橄欖碎末殺的

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,930
那是橄欖蘸醬 你們兩個挫人

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,380

第六季 第八集

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,960
今天工作怎樣?

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,810
我整個下午都在忙著生成同位素的
純結晶體用來做中微子探測

38
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,710
聽起來挺有意思的

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
就是很有意思啊

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,320
挺好 至少沒猜錯

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,320
你在跟誰聊呢

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,080
就剛在學校認識的

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,790
不錯啊 我們還在約會 對吧?

44
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,830
放輕鬆 他只是個朋友

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,250
我們在一起準備口頭報告

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,220
他人很好

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,380
不好意思 剛剛是什麼來著

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,140
我聽到"口"就風中凌亂了

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,570
你夠了

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,690
他剛從倫敦搬過來 好嗎?

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,020
在這人生地不熟的

52
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,890
那好啊 英式口音 號稱最性感的口音

53
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,540
不對不對

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,980
還有法國口音 意大利口音

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,110
你說得對 英式口音確實最好

56
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,290
那你告訴他 你有男朋友了嗎

57
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,860
沒提到這茬呢

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,230
好吧 那你應該告訴人家

59
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,500
那我怎麼開口啊

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,180
你就說 "現在沒空"

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,420
"跟男友在一起 英格蘭挫你也挫
米國至高"

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,670
好吧

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,170
"跟男友在一起 待會說"

64
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,820
- 高興了吧?
- 是的 多謝

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,580
他怎麼回的?

66
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,940
沒啥

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,830
到底是啥?

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,740
"你男朋友讓你這麼說的吧?"

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,920
我恨這個人

70
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,780
別這樣啦

71
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,560
得了 相信我 他想泡你呢

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,990
他沒有 我們只是朋友而已

73
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,250
這有問題嗎?

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,050
他明天還要過來準備呢

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,170
什麼? 來這兒?

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,090
如果讓你不舒服
我可以換個學習夥伴

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,870
但是作業下周就截止了
每個人都已經有學習夥伴了

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,800
所以這門課我估計就廢了

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,010
換吧 真好 多謝哦

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,370
2點44 時間剛好

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,530
嘿 Sheldon

82
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,440
你們好啊

83
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,990
Raj和我準備去遺傳學實驗室
跟夜光小兔兔玩玩

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,050
要去嗎?

85
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,100
多謝 不用了

86
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,790
你確定?

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,200
關燈後就會像一場激光秀一樣
它還會隨地大小便

88
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,690
我確定不要去 你們玩得開心

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,030
你要去哪

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,750
你們去哪

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,630
- 我們剛剛說了啊
- 我剛才也說了啊

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,240
你哪有說

93
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,760
那我們口供不一 法庭見

94
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,310
我們要不要跟蹤他

95
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,970
不知道 我很糾結

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,010
既想知道他去哪兒 又想和小兔兔玩

97
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,230
你們好啊

98
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,930
嘿 Alex 你知道你老闆剛才去哪了嗎

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,880
- 不知道
- 你不知道他的行程?

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,600
我知道燈芯絨褲子很吵
必須去換條"安靜"點的褲子

101
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,720
走吧

102
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,200
真想她能脫下那條褲子...

103
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,380
換上條時髦點的

104
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,360
他就是來這兒?

105
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,460
裡面有什麼?

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,530
我覺得是個舊庫房

107
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,480
他每天在這待20分鐘能幹些什麼?

108
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,570
肯定不是練20分鐘的腹肌
要是的話 他的腹肌會壯些

109
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,740
有動靜嗎?

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
還沒

111
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,970
你幹嗎呢?

112
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,440
偷聽啊

113
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,980
你就不能換個邊聽嗎?

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,530
我做什麼都不如你的意是吧?

115
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,310
他到底在這幹嗎來了?

116
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,720
他就是個怪人

117
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,820
搞不好他把Leonard Nimoy鎖在這了
("星際迷航"Spock扮演者)

118
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,820
要不就是比爾蓋茨或者霍金

119
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,710
他幹嗎要鎖住霍金?

120
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,280
Howard 拜託
你不能因為別人殘疾就歧視他

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,180
這樣不好

122
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,490
如果你好奇我為何要在這偷窺

123
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,370
那我就告訴你
我想看看那個來看Penny的人長啥樣

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,190
老實說 我不知道你在家

125
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,290
其實沒什麼大不了的

126
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,010
他們只是一起上歷史課 做課題

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,610
我幹嗎在乎這麼多呢

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,060
我不在意

129
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,770
你只是這麼想而已

130
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,850
傻透了

131
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,710
這有什麼好擔心的

132
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,690
我不確定

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,400
從統計學上來說
你確實該擔心一二

134
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,680
什麼意思

135
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,880
假設你的相貌是平均水平

136
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,790
馬上 世上50%的男人都比你帥

137
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,240
15億的美男子都等著找你麻煩呢

138
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,760
好吧 這只是就外表來說

139
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,370
我還有很多方面高於平均水平呢

140
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,390
起碼不是身高 視力 運動細胞
奶製品承受能力

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,630
我是指心理成熟度這類的

142
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,900
你剛才還擠貓眼裡偷窺你女友

143
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,670
你還是當做不知道我在家吧

144
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,330
我不是說你毫無吸引力

145
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,410
至少選擇朋友的眼光無懈可擊
睡覺也挺老實的

146
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,430
還有最重要的是
你會給我買我最愛的葡萄

147
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,460
比起滿冰箱壞葡萄的打鼾男
你是還蠻不錯的

148
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,760
跟這些沒關係

149
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,720
我相信Penny是在乎我的
不至於和那傢伙有什麼

150
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,740
要是他會催眠術就說不定了

151
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,290
什麼?

152
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,290
雖然 這是個小概率事件

153
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,950
搞不好她和他滾了床單
自己還不知道呢

154
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,750
你別瞎扯了好嗎

155
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,170
我瞎扯?

156
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,690
人心捉摸不透的 Leonard

157
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,890
他們共赴巫山時
搞不好她以為自己是小雞在啄米呢

158
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,320
瞧瞧我們 半夜三更 鬼鬼祟祟
好像一對夜賊

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,320
我覺得我們更像忍者

160
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,700
我不要當忍者
我要當夜賊

161
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,800
好吧 我做忍者 你做夜賊

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
不行 咱倆要保持一致

163
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,160
好吧 那就忍者

164
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,080
謝謝您

165
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,950
不過下次 咱要當夜賊

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,630
上鎖了

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,040
你確定嗎

168
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,890
當然 必須確定

169
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,730
你來放哨 我去...

170
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,000
確實鎖了

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,890
你好好把風

172
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,160
我分分鐘就能打開

173
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,890
你什麼時候學會撬鎖的

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,110
我初中開始表演魔術那會兒

175
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,370
我覺得自己能做脫身術大師 
就像Harry Houdini

176
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,440
結果如何

177
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,380
還不錯啦

178
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,540
朋友 人氣 派對 我都成功擺脫了

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,630
成功 準備好了嗎

180
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,420
- 等等
- 怎麼了

181
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,020
Sheldon非常聰明
這件事他很想保密

182
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,520
是啊 所以呢

183
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,360
會不會有陷阱機關呀

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,840
別擔心 我比他厲害

185
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,660
那就好 你有啥計劃...

186
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,390
還活著嗎

187
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,430
是啊

188
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,150
43

189
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,830
到底什麼意思呢

190
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,320
我不知道

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,090
方程的解嗎

192
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,950
也許吧

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,940
這是質數

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,080
加密系統就是基於質數構造的

195
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,760
Sheldon想要加密什麼呢

196
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,450
他讓雞蛋沙拉變美味的秘方 
一直不肯外傳

197
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,030
是辣椒粉啦

198
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,880
是嗎

199
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
好吧 一大謎團解決了

200
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,190
好了 晚安

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,530
Cole 謝謝 回頭學校見啦

202
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,770
再見

203
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,720
我去去就回

204
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,020
我以為你早就走了

205
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,100
你好啊

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,190
你要搬來五樓住嗎

207
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,970
不是的 我來看朋友

208
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,140
很好

209
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,880
四樓那位金髮正妹嗎

210
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,000
是啊 你認識她嗎

211
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,530
我...有時見過她

212
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,100
但我都保持距離的 她男友很恐怖的

213
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,560
是嗎

214
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,200
是啊 混幫派的

215
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,740
她說男友是科學家呀

216
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,480
這是他們幫派的名字

217
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,850
"科學家"幫

218
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,390
超級凶的

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,630
感謝提醒

220
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,510
兄弟 別客氣 保持冷靜哈

221
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,090
我們不會分手吧

222
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,500
你好 Hofstadter博士

223
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Alex 你好 叫我Leonard就行

224
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,290
Hofstadter博士是我爸

225
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,600
還有我媽

226
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,280
還有我姐

227
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,630
還有我家的貓

228
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,380
不過我確定 
靴靴-Hofstadter博士只是榮譽學位

229
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,570
能坐這裡嗎 Leonard

230
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,700
- 當然
- 謝謝

231
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
Alex 我跟你咨詢一下

232
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,020
我女友在學校認識一男生

233
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,550
他一口英國腔

234
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,970
好愛英國腔

235
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,620
看出來了 妹子都喜歡

236
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,700
然後吧 我覺得他在勾引她

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,630
她說那人只是人很好 讓我相信她

238
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,090
應該沒問題吧

239
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,000
你明白的

240
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,240
你肯定也經常被勾引吧

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,570
是的 因為女孩們常說

242
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,090
"哎喲 那傢伙有兩套星際迷航制服
而且耳朵感染嚴重"

243
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,740
"我也好想要啊"

244
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,930
我也說不好 但估計你低估自己了

245
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,240
- 相信我 不會的
- 你確定嗎

246
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,500
你可愛風趣

247
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,890
也許有時候被勾搭了 只是你沒發覺

248
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,590
是嗎

249
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,230
我很確定呢

250
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,230
好吧 我要回去工作了 感謝聽我嘮叨

251
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,070
別客氣

252
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,740
希望半路沒有女生要扒我衣服

253
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,640
拜託 我們是聰明人

254
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,060
能想出來的

255
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,270
43

256
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,540
代表什麼呢

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,170
除了我媽的頸圍

258
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,090
元素週期表第43位是鎝

259
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,590
放射性元素呢

260
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,350
他要造炸彈嗎

261
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,100
那個我倒不擔心
一個樂高死星積木他都搞了兩年

262
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,660
哦哦 可能是這個

263
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,270
43卡路里是半杯脫脂酸奶的熱量

264
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,270
你怎麼會知道那個?

265
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,510
不好意思 想吃就吃 怎麼保持好身材?

266
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,330
等等 "銀河系漫遊指南"裡

267
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,640
生命 宇宙 所有事物的答案
不就是43嗎?

268
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,680
那是42 白癡

269
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,940
嘿 嘿 我會難過的

270
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,400
算了 別搞了

271
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,490
都筋疲力盡了

272
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,600
我也是

273
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,820
我們還有更重要的事

274
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,840
誰管它什麼狗屁43?

275
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
我也不管

276
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,200
回家吧

277
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,560
想去吃點東西嗎?

278
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,950
聽起來不錯

279
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,230
他媽的43到底是什麼?!

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,840
我必須弄清楚!

281
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,180
嘿 你不是該和你的兄弟們
往牆上噴方程式了嗎?

282
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,030
哎呀 對不起

283
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,560
你居然不信任我

284
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,580
不是 我當然信任你啦

285
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,670
那你幹嗎讓我在朋友面前丟臉
順便說下 他早認識你了

286
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,270
真的?

287
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
我冰箱上有你的照片啊

288
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,650
我現在是真正討厭這個人了

289
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,590
你到底怎麼了?

290
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,490
是不是上班把腦子用光
回家後就沒腦子了?

291
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,680
我不知道

292
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,320
有時候真的很痛苦

293
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,470
你不管去哪  即便我在旁邊
都有人跟你搭訕

294
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,980
而且他們都比我高

295
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,740
為什麼人人都比我高?

296
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,840
算了 都是我自己瞎想

297
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,510
我自己的問題 和你無關

298
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,230
Leonard 你怎麼老是這樣?

299
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,970
聽著 和我一起的是你

300
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,890
你知道我愛你的
所以請你不要讓我抓狂

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,030
這是你第一次說你愛我

302
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,200
是啊

303
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,380
我們是不是該假裝沒什麼大不了?

304
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,840
那個...

305
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,130
我們是應該假裝 因為...

306
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,820
我快哭了

307
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,800
如果我哭的話 你也會哭的

308
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,400
是啊 你該走了

309
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,880
好的

310
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,810
她愛我

311
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,610
嘿 我是Alex

312
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,760
能和你喝咖啡很開心

313
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,720
如果你還想聊聊 我隨時有空

314
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,360
笑臉 笑臉

315
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,980
這妹子真友善啊

316
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
好 有圖像了

317
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,430
看來攝像頭工作正常

318
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,120
還挺清晰的

319
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,070
能不清晰嘛
這可是火星探測器的備用攝像頭

320
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,040
你怎麼弄到的?

321
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,570
攝像頭值幾百萬
但鎖只是十塊的鎖

322
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,780
天哪 他進來了

323
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,340
就要知道了

324
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,590
那東西是啥?

325
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,560
不知道

326
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,490
我是Sheldon Cooper博士

327
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,870
實驗記錄

328
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,310
蟲洞生成器第44次測試

329
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,010
蟲洞生成器測試?

330
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,050
前43個平行宇宙
據我觀測均空無一物

331
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,180
我想第44號宇宙也應該差不多吧

332
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,860
- 天哪
- 我勒個去!

333
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,150
它在啃我臉!

334
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,760
它在啃他臉!

335
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,010
我發現了你們的攝像頭
就換了裡面的錄像

336
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
你倆真不知羞恥

337
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,740
Sheldon 我們非常抱歉

338
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,170
是啊 非常抱歉

339
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,470
抱歉?

340
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,780
也許你們還沒發現
我在日常生活的某些方面有些障礙

341
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,450
比如 理解諷刺 裝熟充楞

342
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,220
控制不住聊火車的衝動

343
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,780
這都讓我很累

344
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,640
所以我每天抽出20分鐘的時間
去那個房間

345
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,600
靜下心來 隨心所欲"充下電"

346
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,470
但你都在裡面幹嗎呀?

347
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,240
還有43代表什麼?

348
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,720
你們不用知道 你們不配知道
你們也永遠不會知道

349
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,480
但我現在知道
你製作雞蛋沙拉的秘方了

350
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,760
一 二 三 四 五 六 七 八

351
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,120
該死

352
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,310
我再也踢不到43個了

353
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,250
一 二 三 四

354
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,800
該死

00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,970
What are you drawing over there?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,570
A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,590
that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,990
Oh,you silly doodlebug.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,370
You know,a lot of scientists believe

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,310
that making contact with other life-forms
would probably not end well for us.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,680
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole,Leonard.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,570
You can block it with a Frisbee.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,520
Calm down.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,600
Do you expect me to build this?

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,650
I expect you to wipe the
pudding off your chin.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,170
Gentlemen.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,170
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,190
Really?

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,720
He probably just goes to the bathroom.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,730
Actually,no,he goes to
the bathroom at 8:00 a.m.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,840
with optional follow-ups at 1:45
and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,380
It's sad that you know that.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,300
Oh,that's just the tip
of the sadness iceberg.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm looking at his public calendar.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,840
2:45 to 3:05,nothing.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,490
Yesterday,2:45 to 3:05,nothing.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,580
Last week,nothing.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,210
Last month,nothing.

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,010
He never has anything
booked during that time.

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,820
20 minutes a day,completely
unaccounted for.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
We should figure out where he goes.

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,600
Ooh,this is exciting.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,410
Like one of my classic
murder mystery dinner parties.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,180
Right,the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life?

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,510
Colonel Koothrapali in
ten with the olive spread.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,930
It was tapenade and you guys suck.

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,380

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:52,720

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,090

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,960
So,how was work today?

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,810
Well,I spent most of the afternoon growing
isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.

38
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,710
That sounds like fun.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Yeah,it was.

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh,good,I guessed right.

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,320
Who you talking to?

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,080
Oh,just this guy I met at school.

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,790
Oh,great. We're still dating,right?

44
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,830
Relax.He's just a friend.

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,250
We're doing an oral report together.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,220
He's really nice.

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm sorry,what was that?

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,140
I had a little stroke after "oral."

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,570
Would you stop?

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,690
Look,he just moved
here from London,okay?

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,020
He doesn't really know anybody.

52
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,890
Oh,good,an English accent,the
sexiest accent you can have.

53
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,540
No.That's not true.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,980
There's French,there's Italian.

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,110
No,you're right,it's the best.

56
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,290
Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?

57
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,860
It didn't come up.

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,230
Well,maybe you should tell him.

59
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,500
What am I supposed to say?

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,180
Say,"Can't talk right now.

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,420
"Hanging with my boyfriend.England
sucks,you suck,USA number one."

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,670
Fine.

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,170
"Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."

64
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,820
- Happy?
- Yes.Thank you.

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,580
What did he say?

66
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,940
Nothing.

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,830
What?

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,740
"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,920
I hate this guy.

70
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,780
Don't be like that.

71
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,560
Come on,trust me,he's hitting on you.

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,990
No,he's not.We're just friends.

73
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,250
Look,is this gonna be a problem?

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,050
Because he's supposed to
come over tomorrow to work.

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,170
Really?Here?

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,090
If it makes you
uncomfortable,I'll switch partners,

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,870
even though the thing's due next week
and everyone already has a partner

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,800
and I'll probably end
up failing the class.

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,010
That'd be great.Thank you.

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,370
2:44,right on schedule.

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,530
Hey,Sheldon.

82
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,440
Oh,hello.

83
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,990
Raj and I are heading over to the genetics
lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,050
Want to come with us?

85
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,100
No,thank you.

86
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,790
Are you sure?

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,200
They turn off the lights,and it's like a cute
little laser show that poops all over the place.

88
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,690
I'm quite sure.Good day.

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,030
Well,where are you going?

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,750
Where are you going?

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,630
- We just told you.
- I just told you.

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,240
No,you didn't.

93
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,760
Well,it's your word against
mine; see you in court.

94
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,310
Should we follow him?

95
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,970
I don't know,I'm torn.

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,010
I want to know where he's going,but now
I kind of want to play with the bunny.

97
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,230
Hi,guys.

98
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,930
Hey,Alex,do you know
where your boss just went?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,880
- No.
- Don't you know his schedule?

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,600
All I know is corduroy makes too much
noise and I have to go find "quieter pants."

101
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,720
Come on.

102
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,200
Boy,what I wouldn't give to
get her out of those pants...

103
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,380
and into something a
little more stylish.

104
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,360
This is where he goes?

105
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,460
What's in there?

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,530
I think it's an old storage room.

107
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,480
What could he be doing in
there every day for 20 minutes?

108
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,570
Well,he's not doing 20-minute abs,because
if he were,he would have way better abs.

109
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,740
Can you hear anything?

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
Not yet.

111
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,970
What are you doing?

112
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm listening.

113
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,980
Can't you face the other way and listen?

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,530
I can't do anything right for you,can I?

115
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,310
What the hell is he up to?

116
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,720
He is kind of a weirdo.

117
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,820
Maybe he's got Leonard
Nimoy chained up in there.

118
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,820
Or Bill Gates.Or Stephen Hawking.

119
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,710
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

120
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,280
Howard,please,you can't treat the man
differently just because he's disabled.

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,180
That's not okay.

122
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,490
If you're wondering why I've
been staring through the peephole,

123
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,370
I'm trying to get a look at this
guy who's coming over to Penny's.

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,190
To be honest,I didn't
know you were here.

125
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,290
It's not a big deal.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,010
He's just in her history class.They're
working on a project together.

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,610
I don't even know why I care.

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,060
You know what,I don't care.

129
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,770
<i>You think you don't care.</i>

130
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,850
This is silly.

131
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,710
I have nothing to worry about.

132
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,690
Oh,I don't know.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,400
Statistically speaking,I'm sure
you have something to worry about.

134
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,680
What do you mean?

135
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,880
Well,if we assume your looks
are average,right off the bat,

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,790
50% of men on Earth are
more attractive than you.

137
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,240
That's 1.5 billion handsome lads standing
by,waiting to rain on your parade.

138
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,760
Well,yeah,but this
isn't just about looks.

139
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,370
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

140
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,390
Not height,vision,athleticism,or
ability to digest dairy products.

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm talking about important
things like emotional maturity.

142
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,900
You were just spying on your
girlfriend through a peephole.

143
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,670
I liked it better when
you thought I wasn't here.

144
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm not saying you don't
have attractive qualities.

145
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,410
Your choice of friends is
impeccable,you're a good sleeper.

146
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,430
And last but not least,you
buy the grapes I like.

147
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,460
You're a real catch compared to some snoring
guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

148
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,760
None of this matters.

149
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,720
I trust that Penny cares about me,and
nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

150
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,740
Well,unless of course
he's a skilled hypnotist.

151
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,290
What?

152
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,290
While unlikely,it's still
a statistical possibility.

153
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,950
She might be performing sexual
acts with him and not even know it.

154
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,750
Now you're just being ridiculous.

155
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,170
Am I?

156
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,690
The mind's a mysterious thing,Leonard.

157
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,890
He could be having the time of his life while
she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.

158
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,320
Look at us,sneaking around in the middle
of the night like a couple of cat burglars.

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,320
I think we're more like ninjas.

160
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,700
I don't want to be a ninja;
I want to be a cat burglar.

161
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,800
Fine,I'll be a ninja,you
be a cat burglar.

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
No,we both have to be the same thing.

163
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,160
Okay,we're ninjas.

164
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,080
Thank you.

165
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,950
But next time,we'll be cat burglars.

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,630
It's locked.

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,040
Are you sure?

168
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,890
Yes,I'm sure.

169
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,730
Now,you stand guard,I'm going to...

170
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,000
It's locked.

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,890
Just keep an eye out.

172
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll have this open in a minute.

173
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,890
When did you learn how to pick locks?

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,110
When I was starting to
do magic in junior high,

175
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,370
I thought I could be an escape
artist like Harry Houdini.

176
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,440
How did that work out?

177
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,380
Pretty good.

178
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,540
I managed to escape friends,popularity,and
every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,630
There. Ready?

180
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,420
- Hold on,hold on.
- What?

181
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,020
Sheldon is a very smart man,and he
obviously wants to keep this a secret.

182
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,520
Yeah,so?

183
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,360
What if it's booby-trapped?

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,840
Don't worry,I'm one step ahead of him.

185
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,660
Great,what's your pl...

186
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,390
Are we good?

187
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,430
Yeah.

188
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,150
Forty-three.

189
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,830
What the hell does that mean?

190
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,320
I don't know.

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,090
The solution to an equation?

192
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,950
Maybe.

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,940
It's a prime number.

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,080
Encryption systems are
built on prime numbers.

195
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,760
What kind of secret does
Sheldon have to encrypt?

196
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,450
He's always been very cagey about what he
puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

197
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,030
It's paprika.

198
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,880
Really?

199
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
Well,okay,one mystery solved.

200
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,190
Okay,good night.

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,530
Thanks,Cole.See you at school.

202
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,770
See you.

203
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,720
I'll be right back.

204
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,020
I thought you left a long time ago.

205
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,100
What's up?

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,190
You moving into the
apartment on the fifth floor?

207
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,970
No,I was just visiting a friend.

208
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,140
Oh,cool.

209
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,880
That cute blonde on four?

210
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.You know her?

211
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,530
I,well,I see her around.

212
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,100
I like to keep my distance because
her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.

213
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,560
Really?

214
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah.He's ganged up.

215
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,740
She told me he's a scientist.

216
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,480
That's the name of his gang.

217
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,850
The Scientists.

218
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,390
They are crazy.

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,630
Well,thanks for the tip.

220
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,510
No problem,brother.Stay frosty.

221
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,090
We're still dating,right?

222
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,500
Oh,hello,Dr.Hofstadter.

223
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Hey,Alex,and call me Leonard.

224
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,290
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

225
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,600
And my mother.

226
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,280
And my sister.

227
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,630
And our cat.

228
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,380
Although,I'm pretty sure Dr.Boots
Hofstadter's degree was honorary.

229
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,570
May I join you,Leonard?

230
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,700
- Sure.
- Thanks.

231
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
Hey,Alex,let me ask you something.

232
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,020
My girlfriend knows this guy at school.

233
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,550
He's got an English accent.

234
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,970
Ooh,I love English accents.

235
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,620
Yeah,you all do.

236
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,700
Anyway,I feel like he's hitting on her.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,630
She says he's just being nice
and that I should trust her.

238
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,090
It's probably harmless.

239
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,000
You know how it is.

240
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,570
Right. Because girls are always like,

242
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,090
"Ooh,that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms
"and gets a lot of ear infections.

243
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,740
I got to get me some of that."

244
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,930
I don't know,I bet it
happens more than you realize.

245
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,240
- Trust me,it doesn't.
- You sure?

246
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,500
You're cute,you're funny.

247
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,890
Maybe you're getting hit
on,and you don't even know it.

248
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,590
Really?

249
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm pretty sure.

250
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,230
Okay,I got to get back to
work.Thanks for listening.

251
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,070
No problem.

252
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,740
Hope-hope no girls rip
my clothes off on the way.

253
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,640
Come on,we're smart guys.

254
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,060
We can figure this out.

255
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,270
Forty-three.

256
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,540
What is 43?

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,170
Besides my mom's neck size.

258
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,090
It's the atomic number for technetium.

259
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,590
That stuff's radioactive.

260
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,350
Do you think he's building a bomb?

261
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,100
It took him two years to put together
that Lego Death Star; I'm not worried.

262
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,660
Ooh,this could be something.

263
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,270
43 is the number of calories in
half a cup of fat-free yogurt.

264
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,270
Why would you know that?

265
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,510
I'm sorry.We can't all eat whatever
we want and still stay thin.

266
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,330
<i>Wait,in the Hitchhikers
Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

267
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,640
isn't 43 the answer to the question
of life,the universe,and everything?

268
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,680
That's 42,dumb-ass.

269
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,940
Feelings.

270
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,400
We should stop.

271
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,490
I'm exhausted.

272
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,600
Yeah,me,too.

273
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,820
We've got more important things to do.

274
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,840
Who cares what stupid 43 means?

275
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
Not me.

276
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's go home.

277
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,560
You want to get something to eat?

278
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,950
Sounds good.

279
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,230
What the balls is 43?!

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,840
I have to know!

281
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,180
Hey,shouldn't you be out with your gang,spray
painting equations on the side of buildings?

282
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,030
Come on,I'm sorry.

283
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,560
I just can't believe you don't trust me.

284
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,580
I do,of course I do.

285
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,670
Then why did you embarrass me in front of my
friend,who,by the way,knew exactly who you were?

286
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,270
Really?

287
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
Your picture's on my refrigerator.

288
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,650
You know,I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

289
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,590
What is your problem?

290
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,490
Do you use up all your thinking at work and
then have none left over for when you get home?

291
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,680
I don't know.

292
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,320
It's hard sometimes.

293
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,470
Everywhere you go,guys hit on
you,even if I'm standing right there.

294
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,980
And they're all taller than me.

295
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,740
Why is everyone taller than me?

296
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,840
You know what,this is all in my head.

297
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,510
It's my problem,not yours.

298
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,230
Leonard,why do you always do this?

299
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,970
Listen to me,you're the one I'm with.

300
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,890
You know I love you,so will you please
relax because you're driving me crazy.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,030
You know that's the first time
you ever said that you love me.

302
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,200
Yeah.

303
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,380
We're just supposed to
pretend it's not a big deal?

304
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,840
That's...

305
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,130
exactly what we're gonna do because...

306
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,820
you're about to make me cry,

307
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,800
and we both know if I start
crying,you're gonna start crying.

308
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,400
You're right,you should go.

309
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,880
All right.

310
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,810
She loves me.

311
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,610
"Hey,it's Alex.

312
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,760
"Nice having coffee with you.

313
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,720
"If you want to talk
more,I'm always available.

314
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,360
Smiley face,smiley face."

315
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,980
What a friendly girl.

316
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay,picture's up.

317
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,430
Looks like the camera's working.

318
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,120
That's good quality video.

319
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,070
It better be.It's the spare
camera for the Mars rover.

320
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,040
How did you get your hands on that?

321
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,570
Million dollar camera--
ten dollar lock.

322
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,780
Oh,my God,here he comes.

323
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,340
This is it.

324
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,590
What the hell is that thing?

325
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,560
I don't know.

326
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,490
This is Dr.Sheldon Cooper.

327
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,870
Experimental log.

328
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,310
Wormhole generator test 44.

329
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,010
Wormhole generator test?

330
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,050
The first 43 parallel universes
I've checked proved to be empty.

331
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,180
I see no reason to suspect universe
number 44 will be any different.

332
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,860
- Oh,my God!
- Holy crap!

333
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,150
It's eating my face!

334
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,760
It's eating his face!

335
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,010
I found your Webcam and
replaced the video feed.

336
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

337
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,740
Sheldon,we're really sorry.

338
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,170
Yeah,really sorry.

339
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,470
Sorry?

340
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,780
You may not realize it,but I have difficulty
navigating certain aspects of daily life.

341
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,450
You know,understanding
sarcasm,feigning interest in others,

342
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,220
not talking about trains
as much as I want to.

343
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,780
It's exhausting.

344
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,640
Which is why,for 20 minutes a
day,I like to go down to that room,

345
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,600
turn my mind off and do what
I need to do to recharge.

346
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,470
But what are you doing in there?

347
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,240
And what does 43 mean?

348
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,720
You don't need to know,you don't
deserve to know,and you will never know.

349
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,480
***

350
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,760

One,two,three,four,five,six,seven,eight...

351
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,120
Drat.

352
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,310
I'm never going to get to 43 again.

353
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,250
One,two,three,four...

354
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,800
Rats.
