1
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,544
It's absolutely intolerable.

2
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,943
- Yes, Minister.
- Quite so, Minister.

3
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:55,585
Each separate department about to order
different word-processing equipment,

4
00:00:55,755 --> 00:01:02,102
and I persuaded them to place
one big central order for everyone -

5
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:07,142
big enough for UK manufacturers
to invest in systems development.

6
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:09,702
- Yes, Minister.
- I don't have to tell you.

7
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,352
No, Minister.

8
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:15,871
Months of negotiation and we were
on the eve of a press announcement:

9
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,231
"Hacker's massive investment
in modern technology."

10
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,273
"Jim's vote of confidence in British industry."

11
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,948
"'Britain can make it,' says Jim."

12
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:26,671
Quite so.

13
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:31,749
And now this directive from Brussels
saying all EEC members

14
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:36,112
must conform to some niggling European
word-processing standards;

15
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:40,473
that we have to agree
to the plans of committees

16
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:45,185
at the forthcoming European
Word-Processing Conference in Brussels.

17
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,548
Well, say something!

18
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,709
- Yes, Minister.
- Quite so.

19
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,388
Is that all?

20
00:01:55,554 --> 00:02:00,468
I'm afraid that's the penalty we pay
for pretending we're Europeans.

21
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,102
I fully understand your hostility to Europe.

22
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:07,553
I'm not like you, Humphrey.
I'm pro-Europe, just anti-Brussels.

23
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:10,786
I sometimes think
you're anti-Europe and pro-Brussels.

24
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,548
I'm neither pro- nor anti- anything.

25
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:18,505
I'm merely a humble vessel
for the fruits of your deliberations.

26
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:23,269
It could be argued that given
the absurdity of the European idea,

27
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,871
that Brussels does its best
to defend the indefensible

28
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:31,151
- and make the unworkable work.
- That's not true, Humphrey!

29
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:35,593
Without sounding pompous, we must
avoid narrow national self-interest.

30
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,063
- It doesn't sound pompous...
- Good.

31
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,825
Merely inaccurate.

32
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,709
Listen, humble vessel,

33
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:47,708
Europe is a community of nations
dedicated towards one goal.

34
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:51,465
May we share the joke?

35
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,942
Minister, let's look at this objectively.

36
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:58,870
It's a game played for national interests.
Why did we go into it?

37
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,947
To strengthen the free Western nations.

38
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:06,426
We went in to screw the French
by splitting them from the Germans.

39
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:12,192
- Why did the French go in?
- To protect their farmers from competition.

40
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:16,506
- And the Germans?
- To cleanse themselves of genocide

41
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:19,553
and apply for re-admission to the human race.

42
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,910
I've never heard such cynicism!

43
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,747
The small nations didn't join for selfish reasons.

44
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,907
Really? Luxembourg is in it for the perks.

45
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,862
The EEC capital,
all that foreign money pouring in.

46
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,831
A sensible central location.

47
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:37,430
With the administration in Brussels
and the Parliament in Strasbourg?

48
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:42,826
Minister! It's like having the Commons
in Swindon and the Civil Service in Kettering!

49
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:48,423
Why do other nations try to get in?
Take the Greeks...

50
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:54,702
I find it difficult to take the Greeks,
open-minded as I am about foreigners.

51
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:59,143
They'll want an olive mountain and a retsina lake.

52
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,112
I don't accept this!

53
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:05,506
I'm sorry. I suppose some
of your best friends are Greeks?

54
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:07,152
(MINISTER) Very droll.

55
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:11,352
The problem isn't internationalism
but too much bureaucracy.

56
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:14,871
The bureaucracy is a consequence
of the internationalism.

57
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,629
Why else is there an English Commissioner,

58
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:23,584
a French Director-General below him,
an Italian Chef-du-Division and so on?

59
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,825
- It's like the Tower of Babel.
- I agree.

60
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,269
- Like the United Nations.
- I agree.

61
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:32,584
If I may interject?
You are in fact in agreement.

62
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,950
(BOTH) No, we're not.

63
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:40,871
They say the average Common Market official
has the organising ability of the Italians,

64
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,947
the flexibility of the Germans,
the modesty of the French,

65
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:48,391
the imagination of the Belgians,
the generosity of the Dutch

66
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,670
and the intelligence of the Irish!

67
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,793
- It's all a gravy train!
- How do you mean?

68
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:59,664
They live on champagne and caviar.
Chauffer-driven Mercedes, private aeroplanes.

69
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:05,467
Every official has his snout in the trough,
and most of them their trotters as well!

70
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:11,584
Oh, I beg to differ. Brussels is full
of hard-working public servants

71
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:14,825
enduring exhausting travel
and tedious entertainment.

72
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:19,510
Working their way through smoked salmon,
forcing back all that champagne!

73
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:25,782
- You're blaming the wrong people.
- What do you mean?

74
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:32,142
One of your Cabinet colleagues
warned Brussels of your plan for bulk buying,

75
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,148
which is why the directive appeared so quickly.

76
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:40,628
Cabinet colleagues?
Don't tell me! Bloody Corbett again!

77
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:45,624
When I think of Corbett, I warm to Judas Iscariot!

78
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:51,106
Yes, it was the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry.

79
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:57,463
Treacherous, disloyal, arrogant,
self-opinionated, publicity-seeking creep!

80
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,144
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.

81
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:06,188
Compared to what his Permanent Secretary says,
that's a generous tribute.

82
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,554
- How did he do it?
- Who knows?

83
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,432
The evening paper, Minister.

84
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:15,588
Whenever Corbett comes near me,
I feel stabbing pains in the back.

85
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,142
Why did you give me this, Bernard?

86
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,383
- Just there.
- Oh, yes.

87
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:23,786
Good God! Cabinet reshuffle!

88
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:28,628
"It's rumoured that the PM will
announce important Cabinet changes

89
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,262
"before the end of the present session."

90
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:36,026
Why didn't I know about this?
How do they know? Is this true?

91
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:41,110
I'm only a humble civil servant,
I do not move in such exalted circles

92
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,548
as Cabinet Ministers and journalists.

93
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:46,023
- But is it true?
- Yes.

94
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,151
How do you know?

95
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,545
I mean, it's true that it's rumoured.

96
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:57,191
A Cabinet reshuffle! I've hardly started
to do the things that I... we...

97
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:00,106
Perhaps you won't be moved, Minister.

98
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:04,789
Ah... If I'm not, it means my career
isn't moving forward as it should.

99
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,787
At least it's not moving backwards.

100
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:12,425
Backwards? You don't mean...? Good God! But I...

101
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:17,874
It's not... I mean, it's...
I've been doing all right, haven't I?

102
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,992
- We've done all right?
- You've done all right.

103
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,827
- We've done all right?
- Yes, Minister.

104
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:29,023
I may not be the outstanding success
of this administration, but I'm not a failure.

105
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:34,063
- You've done all right.
- I've been quite successful.

106
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,822
If Martin were moved to the Treasury,
I could get the Foreign Office!

107
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,226
Perhaps you might.

108
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,704
- You don't sound very certain.
- I'm not.

109
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:52,753
- What have you heard?
- Nothing, it's why I'm not certain.

110
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:57,066
- Why does Bob Carver know?
- Perhaps he has the PM's ear.

111
00:07:57,235 --> 00:08:01,624
- He's in the PM's pocket.
- Then the PM must have a large ear.

112
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:07,822
Right, well... Let's not worry about it any more.

113
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:16,624
- We'll say no more about it.
- Yes, Minister. I mean, no, Minister.

114
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:19,786
There's no point worrying about it, is there?

115
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,508
- Nothing to worry about, is there?
- No, Minister.

116
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,144
Shall we attend the Brussels conference?
We should.

117
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:31,508
But if the PM should move Fred...?

118
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:34,187
Shall we attend the conference in Brussels?

119
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:37,903
- What?
- Word-processing.

120
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:42,432
Ah! Well, does it take place
before or after the reshuffle?

121
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:47,383
- Who can say?
- Well, no. I've known this happen before.

122
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:51,467
One day you're out of your office,
the next you're out of office.

123
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,829
This is no time for an idiotic foreign junket!

124
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:57,986
Minister, you mustn't allow
the reshuffle to prey on your mind.

125
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,383
It's not preying on my mind.

126
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:04,352
- I'm not thinking any more about it.
- Splendid.

127
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:09,191
Meet me at 6 o'clock in the House
of shuffles... cards... Commons.

128
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,106
- Good evening, Sir Humphrey.
- Good evening, Major.

129
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:24,062
Arnold, when will we know about the reshuffle?

130
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,145
A little while yet.

131
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,430
Any news yet about my department?

132
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:34,305
I'm only Cabinet Secretary,
not political correspondent of the New Standard.

133
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,828
But how does my Minister stand?

134
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,111
I think the PM feels he's done all right.

135
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,744
But there's been an interesting development.

136
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,383
- Mmm?
- Mmm.

137
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,104
Aahh!

138
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,311
What?

139
00:09:55,633 --> 00:10:00,754
Brussels have asked if he'd be available
for the next commissionership, if he wanted it.

140
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,223
After all, he's a good European.

141
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,828
In strict confidence, of course.

142
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:08,144
Is he being gently eased out?

143
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,225
Sir Humphrey, Sir Arnold.

144
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,703
There you are, Bernard.

145
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:15,627
Right. Would you like a coffee, Bernard?

146
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,262
- Thank you.
- Pull up a chair.

147
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:26,062
Well, Bernard, how do you feel
about having a new Minister?

148
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,432
- You mean, he's...
- No, Sir Humphrey is conjecturing.

149
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,505
Ah, of course, I'd be very sorry.

150
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:38,067
Er... Why? Wouldn't you?

151
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,426
Of course not!

152
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:43,267
- But he's getting a grip on the job.
- Exactly!

153
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,471
Ministers with a grip on the job are a nuisance.

154
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:49,194
- They argue.
- All Ministers argue.

155
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:54,792
If they have a grip on the job,
there's a real danger they'll be right.

156
00:10:56,234 --> 00:11:00,466
One tells them something is impossible
and they dig out an old paper

157
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:03,865
in which one had said it was easy -
very tedious.

158
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:08,549
Once they've gone, one can wipe
the slate clean and start with a new boy.

159
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:12,548
Wonderful things, reshuffles.
And Prime Ministers like them too.

160
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,070
Fresh, decisive, keeps everyone on the hop.

161
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,145
Only Ministers panic about them.

162
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,628
Wouldn't it be interesting if Ministers were fixed

163
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:24,182
and Permanent Secretaries were shuffled around.

164
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:34,427
That, Bernard, would strike
at the very heart of the system

165
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,870
that has made Britain what she is today.

166
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,945
Power goes with permanence.

167
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:43,901
- Impermanence is impotence.
- Rotation is castration.

168
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,066
It's time they all had a little spin.

169
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,548
Yes, but surely in a democracy...

170
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:52,182
Thank you, Bernard, that'll be all.

171
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:55,267
- Yes, but I've only...
- Thank you, Bernard.

172
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,629
Yes, thank you, Sir Humphrey.

173
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:00,262
Good night, Sir Arnold.

174
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:10,754
If your Minister does take Brussels,
I wouldn't get out the champagne too soon.

175
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:16,544
- What do you mean?
- There is talk of his possible successor.

176
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:19,633
Who?

177
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:22,752
I don't know how to put this, but, well...

178
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,745
...Basil Corbett.

179
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:34,187
What's the matter, darling? Jim?

180
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,589
- Jim!
- I'm sorry.

181
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:41,303
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing, really.

182
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:43,271
Something is.

183
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,709
The papers are full of a reshuffle.

184
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,944
- Are they true?
- I don't know.

185
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,743
- You're in the Cabinet.
- We're the last to find out.

186
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,303
- Can't you ask the PM?
- Of course not.

187
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,910
- Why not?
- Well... I just can't.

188
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:02,709
- It would look as if I were insecure.
- I see.

189
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:07,231
I don't know whether it's good
or bad news, whether I'm up or down.

190
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:09,031
Or round and round.

191
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:12,549
I don't know whether I'm a success or failure.

192
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:16,832
- What do you think?
- I think you've done all right.

193
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,624
- Is that good enough?
- I don't know.

194
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:23,343
- I don't know, is it?
- I don't know.

195
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:27,553
It's difficult to tell. The PM might think
I've been too successful.

196
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,069
You know, a challenge to the leadership.

197
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:31,825
You?!

198
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:37,548
No, not me, but Martin with my support.

199
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,785
If the PM is standing by to repel boarders,

200
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,752
and Martin can't be got rid of safely,

201
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:47,906
which he can't as Foreign Secretary,
I'm the obvious one for demotion.

202
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,951
- Isolate Martin.
- Where would you be sent?

203
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,673
There's no shortage of useless non-jobs.

204
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,906
Lord President, Lord Privy Seal...
Minister of Sport...

205
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,229
...with special responsibility
for droughts and floods.

206
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,183
Maybe you'll get promotion, darling.

207
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:09,346
Maybe... Don't forget there's Basil Corbett.

208
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:12,392
- He's out to get me.
- To get everyone.

209
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:16,467
He's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed,
cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

210
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,865
Why's he so successful?

211
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:21,026
Because he's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed,

212
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,105
cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

213
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,267
- Apart from that?
- He looks OK on TV.

214
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,743
- So do you!
- Do I?

215
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:31,383
- Yes!
- Really mean that?

216
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:34,512
- Yes.
- What a nice thing to say!

217
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:38,352
I've got to elbow Corbett or he'll elbow me.

218
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:41,472
Elbows, the most important
weapon in a politician's armoury.

219
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:46,788
- Other than integrity.
- Integrity?!

220
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:50,071
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

221
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,473
Yes?

222
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:58,263
Who's speaking? Hold on.
It's Gaston Larousse from Brussels.

223
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,424
From Brussels?

224
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:06,031
Bonsoir, Commissionaire... Commissar...

225
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,953
Si...

226
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,549
That's very interesting.

227
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,945
I shall need a little time to think about it.

228
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,263
I'm very honoured.

229
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:24,588
Does Numero Dix know
you're talking to me about this?

230
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:28,305
Number 10.

231
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,029
Downing Street.

232
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:39,388
I see... Tell you what,
give me your home telephone number.

233
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,912
Yes...

234
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:49,066
I'll give you a ring very soon.
Thank you very much, goodbye.

235
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,191
What was that?

236
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,709
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

237
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:01,946
They want my name put forward
as one of Britain's commissioners for the EEC.

238
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:08,509
- What does it mean?
- Living in Brussels.

239
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,787
No, I mean, what does it mean?

240
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:16,186
Number 10 knows, so is it a plot to ease me out?

241
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:20,552
Is it just a coincidence?
What does it mean? Is it a hint?

242
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,673
Is the PM giving me a face-saving exit?

243
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,712
Or was the post coming up anyway?

244
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:30,230
It's a great honour... in a way.

245
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:33,272
- Is it a good job?
- Terrible.

246
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:37,865
It's curtains as far as British politics is concerned.

247
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:43,504
It's worse than a peerage.
Absolute failure, total failure.

248
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:48,307
You're reduced to forming a new party
if ever you want to get back.

249
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:51,062
What does the job involve?

250
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:55,865
You're at the heart of that ghastly
Brussels bureaucracy, the gravy train.

251
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:59,743
50,000 a year salary, 20,000 a year expenses.

252
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:04,432
Champagne, lobsters, foreign travel, luxury hotel...

253
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,391
...private limousines, private aircraft...

254
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,469
...siestas in the afternoon...

255
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,027
...long weekends at Knocke-le-Zoute...

256
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,987
- We should go over and have a look.
- Why not?

257
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,351
Sometimes we deserve a bit of failure.

258
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,110
Going to be a reshuffle, sir?

259
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:32,585
Yes, I suppose you saw that in the Standard.

260
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,633
- Yes, sir.
- So did I, actually.

261
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,432
I first heard it a couple of weeks ago, sir.

262
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:40,550
- Did you?
- Yes, sir.

263
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:44,229
So did I, really. Where did you hear it?

264
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:46,954
- All the drivers knew.
- How?

265
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,264
From the PM's driver.

266
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,153
- The Cabinet Secretary's driver.
- Oh, yes.

267
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:56,750
- What else did they hear?
- Just the usual.

268
00:17:56,914 --> 00:18:01,351
Corbett's in line for promotion,
PM can't overlook him.

269
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:06,144
Apparently, old Fred -
the Employment Secretary, sorry, sir -

270
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:08,909
he's going to get kicked upstairs.

271
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:12,590
- How do they know?
- His driver's been re-assigned.

272
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:17,391
What's the gossip about me?

273
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,023
Well, nothing really, sir.

274
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:21,753
- Nothing?
- No.

275
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:24,474
We don't know what to make of that.

276
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:28,514
- You'll know, won't you, sir?
- Yes, of course.

277
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,987
Sometimes it's difficult to know about oneself.

278
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:35,545
You, know, just how successful...

279
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:41,628
What do your mates say... about...?

280
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:45,992
They all think you've done all right, sir.

281
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:52,030
- I'm in a bit of a quandary.
- Can I help, Minister?

282
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:55,072
It's this reshuffle that's on the cards.

283
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,709
That's very witty, Minister!

284
00:19:01,354 --> 00:19:05,633
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a...
Do please carry on.

285
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:11,546
To complicate matters, I've been asked
to be an EEC Commissioner.

286
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,831
- Very nice.
- Is it nice, Bernard?

287
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:18,874
Bernard, tell me, quite frankly...

288
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:25,023
...as Minister here,
do you think I've done all right?

289
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,865
You've done all right.

290
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,713
Humphrey's blocked me on so many issues.

291
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,150
He's never really been on my side.

292
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:38,672
To be honest, "all right"
isn't really good enough, is it?

293
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:42,067
Well, it's... all right.

294
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:50,625
Have you... er... heard anything...
on the grapevine?

295
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:52,713
About you?

296
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,865
Nothing really, Minister, no.

297
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:58,266
Only that the British Commissioner
in Europe sent a telegram

298
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:01,313
to the FCO and the Cabinet Committee on Europe.

299
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:04,945
The idea for you to be
a Commissioner came from Brussels,

300
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,913
but it is a Prime Ministerial appointment.

301
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:12,626
The PM discussed it with the Foreign Secretary
and the Cabinet Secretary

302
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,992
and cleared the way for you to be sounded out.

303
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,988
As it's believed at Number 10
and Number 11 that you might accept,

304
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:24,146
a colleague has been sounded outabout becoming Minister here.

305
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm afraid that's all I know.

306
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,144
No more than that?

307
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:36,664
Which colleague has been
sounded out to take my place?

308
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:43,103
Bernard, if I were not to go to Europe...

309
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:48,144
No, if I did go...
No, if I were not to go to Europe,

310
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,226
would I go up or down?

311
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,508
(BUZZER)

312
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,472
Time for your meeting
with Sir Humphrey, Minister.

313
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,353
- Yes, fine.
- What's it about?

314
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,630
The visit to the word-processing conference.

315
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,150
The word-processing conference?

316
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:12,786
Humphrey, you'll be pleased
to hear that I've changed my mind,

317
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,833
I shall be going to Brussels after all.

318
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:19,351
You're resigning from the Department?!

319
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:22,824
No, I'm talking about
this word-processing conference.

320
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:26,269
- I see.
- I would like to see Brussels.

321
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,744
- Why?
- Why not?

322
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,429
Why not, indeed, but why?

323
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:34,869
- I'm a curious person.
- You certainly are.

324
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:37,264
I've been a little hasty.

325
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:40,505
Your arguments on behalf of Brussels
were thoroughly convincing.

326
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:43,950
Minister, I've been reflecting on your views,

327
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:47,152
and I find wisdom in your criticism of Brussels.

328
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:51,706
- You implied it is corrupt and...
- No, no, no.

329
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,070
- Minister, please...
- No, Humphrey.

330
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,668
It is you who have convinced me.

331
00:21:56,834 --> 00:22:00,985
I'm now convinced that
Brussels is full of dedicated men,

332
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,626
all bearing a heavy burden
of travel and entertainment.

333
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,990
They need all that luxury.

334
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,110
The odd drinky!

335
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:13,791
Caviar and champagne, private planes,
air-conditioned Mercedes?

336
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:15,945
It oils the diplomatic wheels.

337
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,950
Snouts in the trough.

338
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:24,188
- That's not an attractive phrase.
- I'm sorry. I can't think where I picked it up!

339
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:27,744
We'll all go to this conference, agreed?

340
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:32,750
- Is your change of heart due to my arguments?
- Of course.

341
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:37,704
It's nothing to do with the rumour
of you being offered a post in Brussels?

342
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:41,190
That thought is not worthy of you.

343
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:44,472
There is such a thing as integrity.

344
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:50,431
Oh, yes, thank you.

345
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:57,663
Corbett! You can't let someone like Corbett...

346
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:04,470
(You simply can't let Corbett
loose on the department.)

347
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,911
(It'd be disastrous.
Everything one says to Corbett)

348
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:10,588
(appears in the Sun the next morning.)

349
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,865
Glad to know you read the Sun.

350
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:18,472
You must stop it, Arnold, I implore you.

351
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:20,590
I'm not the Prime Minister.

352
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:23,269
It is really you who arranges the reshuffles.

353
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:27,144
No, if there's an appointment the PM is set on,

354
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:29,875
the Cabinet Secretary must reluctantly acquiesce.

355
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,353
You do keep your hand on the tiller.

356
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,393
If Hacker decides to turn down Brussels,

357
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:41,182
it would be easier to keep
Corbett away from your department.

358
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:44,108
This is the trouble, he'll take Brussels.

359
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,269
- Oh.
- Yes, I know.

360
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,552
He says he believes in the European ideal.

361
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:53,103
Yes, I know, I know.

362
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:57,869
Politicians get taken in by their own speeches.

363
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:04,229
This is partly your fault.
You've blocked Hacker time and again.

364
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:08,628
Only in the interests
of good government, Arnold.

365
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:13,869
Quite. But what you need is for Hacker
to have a big success in the next few days.

366
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,594
- A big success?
- Yes.

367
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,985
The next few days?

368
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:24,869
That would give me, give the PM,
a good case for keeping him here.

369
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:28,788
Then, we might be able
to move Corbett to Employment.

370
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,431
Is Fred definitely going?

371
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:34,233
Yes, he keeps falling asleep in Cabinet.

372
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:37,831
I thought they all did.

373
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:40,952
Yes, but not while they're actually talking.

374
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:55,831
- Ah, Humphrey! Any news?
- Of what, Minister?

375
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,985
- The Cabinet reshuffle.
- No.

376
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,749
Didn't you have lunch with the Cabinet Secretary?

377
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,825
- Yes.
- What came up?

378
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:04,586
Nothing as yet!

379
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,747
All I know is the reshuffle
will be announced on Monday.

380
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:11,474
- Have you any news?
- Of what?

381
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:14,269
The Commissionship. Are you going to Brussels?

382
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:16,985
Well...

383
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:22,275
Speaking with my Parliamentary hat on,
I don't think it would be a good idea.

384
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:26,713
With my Cabinet hat on, it would be a good idea.

385
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:31,425
Again, with my party hat on,
there could be arguments on both sides.

386
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:34,427
Which hat are you talking through now?

387
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:40,992
- Have you decided about going to Brussels?
- Yes and no.

388
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:46,831
- What are the pros and cons, Minister?
- I don't know.

389
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:52,188
I haven't said this before,

390
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:57,304
but it depends on whether
I've done all right. What do you think?

391
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,465
(BOTH) You've done all right.

392
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:02,307
If I've done all right, that's all right,

393
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,750
I shall stay because I'll be all right.

394
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:09,032
But if I've only done all right,
to stay would be wrong, right?

395
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:14,063
Minister, to be on the safe side,
you need a big success.

396
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:16,465
- Yes.
- A triumph, in fact.

397
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:20,787
You need some personal publicity
for some great political achievement.

398
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,947
- What have you in mind?
- I'm trying to think of something.

399
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:28,391
Thank you, that's a great help.
What's the purpose?

400
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,510
Something did come up at lunch.

401
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,949
Sir Arnold feels that with this triumph,

402
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:35,231
the PM couldn't move you downwards,

403
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:39,512
and Bernard and I might have the good
fortune of you staying on with us.

404
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:41,744
So there's no chance of moving up?

405
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,190
Ooh...

406
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,548
Sadly, Minister, alas.

407
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,592
- One must be a realist.
- Oh, well.

408
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:53,028
That's it, it's got to be Brussels.

409
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,584
No, wait a minute. I've got an idea.

410
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,951
Supposing you ignore the EEC.

411
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:03,072
Publish your own plans for
word-processing machines...

412
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:07,146
...with big orders for
British manufacturers...

413
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:10,583
...starting immediately. Tomorrow.

414
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,789
Certainly before Monday.

415
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:15,867
Involving more jobs, more investment.

416
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,342
- More export orders.
- More votes.

417
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,505
Yes, when the time comes.

418
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:24,110
- We can't defy an EEC directive.
- It isn't a directive.

419
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,425
It hasn't been ratified, it's merely a request.

420
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:30,666
We can't stab our partners
in the back and spit in their face.

421
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,793
You can't stab anyone in the back
while spitting in their face.

422
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:38,188
On the other hand, defying Brussels would be...

423
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:39,867
Very popular!

424
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,264
And prove I had elbows.

425
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,427
What?

426
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:46,949
Elbows, elbows!

427
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,672
- But...
- But what?

428
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,269
I'd have to give up all that...

429
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:54,108
- Trough.
- Right.

430
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:58,586
When it comes down to it,
one's own country must come first.

431
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,032
How true.

432
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:04,709
And, although, strictly,
this isn't a Government matter,

433
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,548
I, personally,
would be deeply sorry to lose you.

434
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:11,103
Really, Humphrey, is that true?

435
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:13,663
Yes, I mean that, Minister, most sincerely.

436
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:17,668
I suppose we have got fond of one another.

437
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,349
- In a way.
- In a way, yes.

438
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:22,869
Like a terrorist and his hostage.

439
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:27,271
Which is the terrorist?

440
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,391
(BOTH) He is!

441
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:33,985
Right, OK, Bernard, that's the decision.

442
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:36,110
Inform the press!

443
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:41,633
Tell me, Humphrey, who would have got
my position if I'd gone to Brussels?

444
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:44,472
I don't know...

445
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:47,865
Didn't you tell me it was Basil Corbett?

446
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,110
Basil Corbett?!

447
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,434
I see, Basil Corbett.

448
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:00,547
Yes, Minister.

449
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:12,321
