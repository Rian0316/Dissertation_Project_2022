1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,450
******g is not technically yogurt,
知道了吧 你吃的这个 不算是真的酸奶酪

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,090
because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures.
因为里面没有足够的 活的嗜酸培养菌

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,600
It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness.
只不过是冰牛奶里加了点 角叉胶 增加粘稠度

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,710
Oh,that's very interesting.
喔 真有意思哈

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,710
It's also not pink and has no berries.
它也不真是粉红色 也没有天然浆果粒

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,190
Yeah,but it doesn't really answer my question.
嗯 可这也没有回答我的问题呐

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,730
What was your question again?
你问的啥问题?

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,910
Do you want some?
你要来点儿不?

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,880
Right. No.
对对 不用了

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,240
- I'm lactose intolerant. - Right.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,730
- So,gas. - Yeah,got it.

Well... good night.
那么... 晚安了

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,720
What are you doing?
你这是做什么呢?

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,390
Oh,there's a draft.
哦 那边有阵风

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
I didn't feel a draft.
我没觉得有风啊

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,950
Why don't we just go into,uh,your...
那我们还是去... 你的...

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,850
Yeah,you know what,maybe we should slow things down a little.
我说 也许我们不该那么着急

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,700
No,no,I didn't mean to go into your apartment to go fast.
不 我不是说要去你公寓 去急着干嘛干嘛

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,720
No,I know.
当然了 我知道

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,620
I know what you meant,it's just... this is only our first date.
我知道你不是那意思 只是... 这才是咱俩第一次约会

21
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,020
Yeah,okay,sure,no problem.
嗯 好啊 没问题

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,890
Why don't we just figure out where we're going and when we want to get there,
那我们就先想想 下次要去哪儿 准备啥时候到那儿

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,670
and then rate of speed equals distance over time.
这样距离除以时间 就知道速度了呗

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,700
Solve for R.
问题解决

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,260
Or we could just wing it.
我们也可以到时候再想嘛

26
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,900
That might work,too.
那没准也行

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
- Good night,Leonard. - Good night.
- 晚安 Leonard - 晚安

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,270
He's coming-- screensaver!
他来了 快上屏保!

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh,hey,Leonard. How was your date?
嘿 Leonard 约会怎么样哇?

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,470
Bite me.
要你管

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,050
Sheldon,how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
Sheldon 你怎么能傻坐着 眼睁睁看他们监视我呢?

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
They were clever,Leonard.
他们油菜啊 Leonard

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,630
They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.
他们完全明白 我对你那些破事儿 一点兴趣没有

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,250
You should thank us.
你还该谢谢我们呢

35
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,980
When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,
要是后来人想弄明白 你和Penny的恋情为啥会土崩瓦解

36
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,280
this right here is the black box.
这玩意儿就是黑匣子呐!

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,930
What are you talking about? The date went fine.
你胡说什么 约会挺好的

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Dude,she said she wants to slow things down.
拜托 她都说了 想要慢慢来

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,060
Okay,so she said she wants to slow things down.
好吧 她是说了 想要慢慢来

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,030
It's like saying,"I'm really enjoying this meal.
意思差不多就是 "今天的晚餐我非常喜欢

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,410
I'm going to slow down and savor it."
我得慢慢来 好好回味一下"

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,780
No,it's like,"This fish tastes bad,
才怪 她的意思是 "这鱼真难吃死了

43
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,030
so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out."
我得慢慢来 吐光了它"

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,190
- You being the fish. - I'm not the fish.
- 这臭鱼说的就是你! - 我才不是这臭鱼呢

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,430
Oh,really? Did you make a second date?
真的? 你俩定了下一次约会吗?

46
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,330
Well,no,we sort of decided to wing it.
这倒没有... 我们说好了 到时候再想

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,450
Oh,even I know that's lame.
得了吧 连我都觉得这太逊了

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,670
Okay,all right,let's assume your hypothesis.
行啊 咱就说说你的假设

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,140
We went to dinner,we talked,we laughed,we kissed.
我们一起去吃饭 有说有笑 有吻有抱

50
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,000
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?
这还能错到哪儿去啊?

51
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,190
Think back,Leonard.
你好好想想 Leonard

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,320
The littlest things can set women off.
再小的事情都能让女人爆发

53
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,200
Like,"Hey,the waitress is hot,I bet we could get her to come home with us."
比方说 "嘿 这服务生真辣 我打赌 肯定能让她跟咱回家"

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,020
Or,"How much does your mom weigh?
或者 "你妈妈有多重呐?

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,410
I want to know what I'm getting into."
我想知道我搭上的是啥样的妞儿"

56
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,830
I didn't say anything like that.
这种话我才不会说

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Good,'cause they don't work.
很好 因为这么说不管用

58
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,440
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate.
她们也不关心 你是不是盯着她们 呼吸加速

59
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,510
Sadly,that's my home run swing.
挺惨的 在我们家 这就像是家族传统

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,820
Look,everything went fine.
我说 一切都挺好的

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,120
I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters.
连事先准备的一些开场白都没用到呢

62
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,970
That woman across the hall is into me.
走廊对面那个女孩 就是喜欢我嘛

63
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,790
Let's go to the tape.
咱还是看带子吧

64
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,890
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss.
你瞧她临别一吻的时候 那反应

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,410
No change in respiration,pupils un-dilated,no flushing of the chest.
呼吸平稳 瞳孔没有放大 胸口也没啥起伏

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,330
Nice close-up,by the way.
这特写镜头拍的真赞

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,990
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched: no tongue access.
有意思嘿 她的下巴很紧 也没有用舌头

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,790
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
对于寻偶期的人类来说 这可不是啥好消息

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,430
That's not a bad sign.
这怎么就不是好消息了

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,720
Please,you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
得了吧 还不如说你们是两只鬣蜥 只是喉部没有垂肉罢了

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,960
And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there.
最糟的就是 这会儿你不在她家 而在这里!

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm not there because I'm taking things slow,which,
我不在她家 因为我也决定慢慢来 这个...

73
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,230
by the way,compared to you guys,approaches warp speed.
跟你们比起来 都快接近星际速度了

74
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,670
And take down that camera.
快把摄像头给我撤了

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,000
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
他心里没牵没挂的时候 真有意思多了

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,380
Give him time.
给他点时间吧

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,010

78
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:24,220

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,490

80
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,380
Oh,hi,Penny.
你好啊 Penny

81
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,450
FYI,the hot water is inadequate on machine two,so colors only,
顺便说句 2号机器的热水不足 别深色浅色混着洗

82
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,360
and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle,
4号机器呢 洗衣程序中 还是会提前放出织物柔顺剂

83
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,130
so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
所以你那些精致的衣服 还是别用那台了

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,120
Thanks.
谢了

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,100
Oh,good Lord...
老天爷啊...

86
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,720
why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
你还不如把衣服拿到河边 搁在石头上猛捶一阵

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,640
Sheldon,can I ask you a question?
Sheldon 我问你个问题行不?

88
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,110
I would prefer that you not,but I won't go so far as to forbid it.
我当然最好你别问 不过也不会阻止你

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,170
All right,I heard yes,so...
那... 我就当你同意了...

90
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,970
Okay,here's my question.
我想问问你

91
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,090
Has Leonard ever dated, you know,a regular girl?
Leonard以前有没有 跟正常的女孩子约会过?

92
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,470
Well,I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity.
我想你指的 应该不是消化功能正常吧

93
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,710
Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
要是那样的话 我想这问题问的不合适

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,660
No,I meant,has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a brainiac?
我是说 他有没有跟 没那么大学问的女孩子谈过?

95
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,070
Well,a few years ago,he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French literature.
话说几年前 他确实跟一个 学法国文学的女博士有过一段儿

96
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,080
How is that not a brainiac?
这还不算有大学问?

97
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,150
Well,for one thing,she was French.
理由一 她是法国人

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,600
For another,it was literature.
理由二 她读的是文学

99
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,120
So...
那你觉得...

100
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,900
do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating,he'll eventually get bored with me?
如果我和Leonard继续好下去 他会不会有一天觉得我很没劲啊?

101
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,400
- That depends. - On what?
- 那得看情况 - 什么情况?

102
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,060
- Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? - No.
- 你懂量子物理吗? - 不懂

103
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,930
- Do you speak Klingon? - No.
- 你会说克林贡语吗?(星际迷航) - 不会

104
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,100
- You know any card tricks? - Okay,you know what...
- 你会耍牌吗? - 行了 我说...

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,250
I get it.
我明白了

106
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,740
Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress-slash-actress
Leonard和一个服务员兼二流演员 没有共同语言

107
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,390
who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
而且她还骗他说 上完了社区大学 心里正发慌呢

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,970
Why would you lie about that?
你为什么撒谎?

109
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,100
Well,he was going on and on about this college and that grad school,and I...
他总是在说这大学怎样 那个研究生院怎么样 我就...

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,640
I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser.
我不想让他觉得我很傻很衰嘛

111
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,430
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"?
你觉得"很傻很衰"的反义词 是"社区大学毕业生"?

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,380
You know,there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
很多成功人士 都是从社区大学毕业的

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,910
Yeah,but you are neither.
没错 可你哪个都挨不上边

114
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,930
Right. Okay,look,this is between you and me.
对 好吧 你得替我保密

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,460
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.
啥也不要告诉Leonard

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,190
- You're asking me to keep a secret? - Yeah.
- 你要我保守秘密? - 是的

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,830
Well,I'm sorry,but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret,
那真对不起了 你应该在说出秘密前 表达出要我保密的意思

118
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,160
so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping.
我好选择 到底要不要替你保密

119
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,200
You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
你事后再说 这怎么行呢

120
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,150
What?
什么?

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,570
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor.
保守秘密是一项艰巨复杂的任务

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,030
One has to be concerned not only about what one says,
不但要注意说的话

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,210
but about facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.
还得注意面部表情 习惯性反应

124
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,520
When I try to deceive,I myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility.
我说谎的时候 因为紧张产生的扁虱(tick) 比莱姆关节炎研究设备产生的还多

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,140
It's a joke.
这是笑话啊

126
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,380
It relies on the homonymic relationship between "tick,"
同音词嘛 "tick"是指

127
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,340
the bloodsucking arachnid,and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction.
吸血蜘蛛 而"tic"是无意识的肌肉痉挛

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,630
I made it up myself.
我自己编的

129
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,190
Okay,look,if Leonard finds out that I lied,I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
听着 如果Leonard发现我说谎 我一定羞愧自尽了

130
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,410
Physiologically impossible.
生理学上讲是不可能的

131
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,260
Oh,Sheldon,please.
哦 Sheldon 拜托

132
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,650
Look,I am asking you as a friend.
我是以朋友的名义请求你

133
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,710
So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
照你这么说 朋友就要无条件的保守秘密?

134
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,410
Well,yeah.
是啊

135
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,780
Interesting.
有意思

136
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,580
One more question,and perhaps I should have led with this.
再一个问题 或许应该这样问

137
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,290
When did we become friends?
我们什么时候成朋友了?

138
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,200
i.e.,I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa,
也就是说 要不被总部守护先知选中 我就成不了绿灯侠 (漫画形象)

139
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,380
but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility,I could be Batman.
但如果给我足够的启动资金和 足够的科研设备 我就能成为蝙蝠侠

140
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,400
