00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,950
<i>孩子们  你们都知道巴尼叔叔有点狼心狗肺</i>
<i>Kids, it's no secret your Uncle Barney is a bit of a dog,</i>

11
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,550
2030年

12
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>虽然他很爱我</i>
<i>and even though he loved me, </i>

13
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,980
<i>但我觉得他一直想找个</i>
<i>I think he always wanted a wingman</i>

14
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,980
<i>跟他一样的狗友做搭档</i>
<i>who was a bit of a dog, too.</i>

15
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,960
<i>在2012年秋天</i>
<i>And in the fall of 2012...</i>

16
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,890
<i>他找到了</i>
<i>...he found one.</i>

17
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,840
致敬
Respect.

18
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,120
致敬

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,380
伙计们  再次多谢  昨晚太棒了
Hey, guys, thanks again for a great night last night.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,540
我再说一遍
I say again,

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,990
昨晚太棒了
great night.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,420
泰德  宝贝  昨晚没那么棒
Ted, honey, it was not a great night.

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,920
泰德
Ted,

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,980
昨晚我和莉莉注意到有些不对劲
Lily and I noticed some things last night.

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,180
-泰德  能帮我递块饼干吗  -好的
- Hey, Ted, can you pass me a cracker? - Yeah.

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,930
为了你  我在圣坛上把人甩了
It's the least you can do,

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,070
你递个饼干也是应该的
considering I left a guy at the altar for you.

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,880
她真搞  对吧
Right, right?

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,760
拜托  那是玩笑话
Oh, come on, that was a joke.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,980
过了三十岁的女人  不会拿结婚开玩笑
Women over 30 don't joke when it comes to commitment.

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,820
维多利亚很乐意我们放慢脚步
Victoria is happy we're taking things slow.

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,270
纯真的小宝贝
Oh, oh, honeysweetiebaby,

33
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,340
没有一个32岁的女人  会乐意放慢脚步
no 32-year-old woman is happy taking things slow.

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,860
相信我  维多利亚一定已经有高中同学
Trust me, Victoria has got friends from high school

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,610
在Facebook上贴自己第二个宝宝的照片了
posting pictures of second babies on Facebook.

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,950
你觉得你女朋友的反应会是
And you think girlfriend's all like,

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,410
"咱们就这样耗下去
"Oh, let's just bone a bunch

38
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,590
我又老了一岁  依旧没老公"
so I'm another year older and still single"?

39
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,260
女人呐  你懂不懂
Bitch, please.

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,800
各位  我新交了个兄弟
Guys, I've got a new bro--

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,670
他能让其他所有的兄弟都自愧不如
a bro that puts all other bros to shame.

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,650
他妞见妞爱
The bitches love him.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,150
还会把"大骨棒"藏起来
He buries bones all day.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,230
没人比他更懂追"屁股"跑这事
No one chases tail like him.

45
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,420
你们怎么不笑
Why aren't you guys laughing?

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,590
等等  我应该先告诉你们
Oh, wait, I probably should have led with this:

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,860
他是条狗
he's a dog.

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,340
我已经给他取名叫
I've named him

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,550
"把你"
Brover.

50
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,220
我现在要去
I'll go...

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,760
"捡"他了
...fetch him.

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,000
我很担心巴尼
Okay, I'm worried about Barney.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,220
跟昆茵分手对他的打击  远不止他说的那样
That breakup with Quinn messed him up more than he let on.

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,270
我觉得他很寂寞
I think he's lonely.

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,130
我看这哥们没事
Dude seems fine to me.

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,740
我爱死你了  把你 
I love you so much, Brover.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,230
说真的  从昨晚的情形看来
Seriously, based on last night,

58
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,780
你和维多利亚一定会出现问题的
you and Victoria are headed for trouble.

59
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,030
我收到一份有趣的工作邀请
So I got this kind of interesting job offer

60
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,330
是去丹佛经营一间面包店
to run a bakery in Denver.

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,580
不过这太疯狂了  对吧
But that's too crazy, though, right?

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,950
对吗
Right?

63
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,090
当然
Uh, yeah.

64
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,020
高海拔会影响点心的密度
The high altitude would affect the density of the pastries.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,410
我是说  会烤不熟啊
I mean, talk about half-baked.

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,820
天啊  今晚太棒了
Man, this is a great night.

67
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,340
那是维多利亚在邀请你跟她搬去丹佛
That was Victoria asking you to move to Denver with her.

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,450
什么
What?

69
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,340
那她为什么不直截了当地
Then, why wouldn't she just come right out

70
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,860
说出她的想法呢
and say what she wants?

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,930
男人啊
Men.

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,390
这就像是  泡菜罐就得难开
It's like, if there weren't pickle jars to open

73
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,030
蜘蛛就得费心拍死  电脑就跌费神备份
and spiders to kill and computers to back up,

74
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,400
人天生为折腾而存在
what would be their point?

75
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,970
好吧  马修什么时候变得比你还阴阳怪气啊
Okay, when did Marshall become a slightly more feminine you?

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,390
泰德  整天主动当人的知心姐姐
Look, Ted, it gets exhausting constantly giving people

77
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,700
太累人了  所以我在训练马修
advice they haven't asked for, so I'm training Marshall.

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,540
我的终极目标是
My goal is to eventually say things

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,330
能说出犀利又睿智的建议
that are so sassy and wise,

80
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,010
让对方除了认同
that there is no possible response

81
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,410
别无他言
other than "Mm" Or "Mm-hmm."

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
那我的梦想就是  有天这里能成为
And if this is a place where we can share our dreams--

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,590
大家分享美梦的园地
I like to think that it is--

84
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,600
我希望有一天  人们会赞我
I hope someday to earn a...

85
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,680
"言之有理"
"Testify."

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,940
维多利亚和我才在一起五个月
Look, victoria and I are five months in

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,490
我们现在就该处于这种阶段
and we're right where we should be.

88
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,510
好吧  生日贺卡上签的是各自的名字
All right, we-we're cosigning birthday cards,

89
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,650
我们在彼此家里都有自己的牙刷
w-we got toothbrushes at each other's places,

90
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,890
现在连前戏也省了
foreplay's out the window.

91
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,130
只剩下"我进  我出  睡觉"  简单又快捷
I'm in, I'm out, I'm sleeping, it's great.

92
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,250
你们在一起可不只五个月
It's more than five months.

93
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,800
你们以前约会过  那段时间也算
You guys dated before; that time counts.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,950
可不会分手过就自动归零
The clock doesn't reset to zero.

95
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,140
而是从上次结束的时间接着算
It un-pauses from where you left off.

96
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,090
不可能
No way,

97
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,170
不可能  时钟会归零
no way, the clock resets.

98
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,730
等等  这就是你们的目的吧
Wait, so this is what you guys do?

99
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,440
邀请其他的情侣过来吃晚饭
You invite other couples over for dinner

100
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,350
然后指手划脚以获得优越感吗
to judge them and feel superior?

101
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,890
成熟点吧  泰德
Oh, grow up, Ted,

102
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,000
这是所有夫妻邀请人来家里的原因
that's why any couple invites anyone over ever.

103
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,590
两杯纯苏格兰威士忌
Two Scotches, both neat,

104
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,530
可以来盘坚果[蛋蛋]  他结扎完就没了
and if you've got some, uh, nuts, this guy lost a couple.

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,390
开个玩笑  开个玩笑啦
Take the hit, just take the hit.

106
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,450
好吧  他显然是在求助
Okay, this is a cry for help.

107
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,070
今晚能邀请巴尼来吃晚饭吗
Can we invite Barney over for dinner tonight?

108
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,510
但我本来为你准备了特别的晚餐
But I was going to make you a special meal

109
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,160
来庆祝我的节目提名了
to celebrate my show getting nominated

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,950
本地区媒体大奖
for a Local Area Media Award.

111
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,420
<i>对了  我忘了说了</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention,</i>

112
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,940
<i>尼克主持一档有线台的烹饪节目</i>
<i>Nick had a cable access cooking show.</i>

113
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,140
尼克・帕达鲁蒂选用
Chef Nick Podarutti uses

114
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,380
本地新鲜食材
all fresh, locally grown ingredients,

115
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,430
但决不要因此就觉得
but don't think for a second

116
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,520
他不是个坏小子
that means he's not a bad boy.

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,320
这车可是玉米动力的哦
She runs on corn.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,420
尼克  坏小子主厨

119
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,350
我要邀请他来共进晚餐
I'm gonna invite him over for dinner.

120
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,080
好吧  
Okay, fine,

121
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,060
但你最好确保他有票
but you'd better make sure he has a ticket.

122
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,640
因为他上的可是什锦佳肴火车哦
'Cause it's all aboard the Chow-Chow Train!

123
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,940
亲爱的  我知道想一句
Honey, I know it's hard coming up

124
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,010
个性烹饪口号实属不易
with a signature cooking catchphrase,

125
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,240
可我真心觉得这句不合适
but I don't think that's it.

126
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,020
我知道  可是什么才能跟人家的"嘭"相比啊
I know, but how do you compete with "Bam!"?

127
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,020
美国明星厨师艾梅里尔・拉加西的口头禅就是"Bam!"

128
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,740
言简意赅
It just says it all.

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,170
你来啦
Hey, you.

130
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,920
能问你点事吗
Hey, can I ask you something?

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,280
莉莉和马修觉得
Um, Lily and Marshall think

132
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,260
我没有领会你的暗示
I'm missing all these hints you're dropping

133
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,280
你希望我们的关系更进一步
that you want a deeper commitment.

134
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,890
你会直截了当告诉我的  对吧
I mean, you'd just come right out and tell me, right?

135
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,960
当然
Totally.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,690
我觉得我能表达得更直接些
I-I think I can be a little bit more direct than that.

137
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,890
谢谢
Thank you.

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,220
我今天打扫我公寓的时候
Oh, hey, I was cleaning my apartment today

139
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,590
翻出了这个
and I dug this up.

140
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,260
我该留着这件婚纱吗
Should I keep this wedding dress,

141
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,210
还是你觉得我"永远"都用不着它了
or do you think i'll never, ever need it again?

142
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,340
所以莉莉和马修说对啦
So Lily and Marshall were right?

143
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,690
那是当然
Of course they're right.

144
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,660
一个女孩穿着婚纱跳进你的车里
When a girl jumps in your car in a wedding dress,

145
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,860
难道会很难猜出
you can't act surprised to find out

146
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,450
她是想结婚的吗
she wants to get married.

147
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,380
再说了  我们以前交往过  那段时间也算
Besides, we dated before, and that time counts.

148
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,090
分手只是让时钟暂停而已
We just hit pause on the clock.

149
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,950
很多聪明人会反驳说  分手后时钟会归零
See, a lot of really smart people would argue the clock resets.

150
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,050
是取消暂停  不是归零  这是常识
It un-pauses, everybody knows that.

151
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,550
巴尼有点小迟到
You know, Barney's a little late.

152
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,510
希望他没事
I hope he's okay.

153
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,030
他没事  我还是觉得
Ah, he's fine, and I still don't think

154
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,640
他没在求助
he's crying out for help.

155
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,350
抱歉我们来晚了
Sorry we're late.

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,730
我们刚从裁缝那里过来
We just came from the tailor.

157
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,110
把尼选领带时拿不定主意  所以我全给买了
Brover couldn't settle on a tie, so I just bought them all.

158
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,840
谁能对这张萌脸说不
You say no to that face.

159
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,490
你无法全心全意的投入
There's a reason that you're not

160
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,290
与我的感情是有原因的  泰德
a hundred percent in this with me, Ted.

161
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,650
有事让我们停滞不前
Something's holding us back.

162
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,110
是什么
Well, what is it?

163
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,710
我想我们已经确定我不是很会察言观色
I think we've established I'm not great at picking up on clues--

164
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,740
感情方面吧
well, in this situation.

165
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,980
但我小时候可是有名的小侦探
As a kid, I was known as a bit of a detective.

166
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,000
我朋友的牙套保持器不见了
In fact, when my friend's retainer went missing,

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,320
莫斯比小子着手调查这件案子  这...
the Mosby Boys were put on the case, and it was...

168
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,280
牙套保持器就在垃圾桶里
The retainer was in the garbage.

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,150
莫斯比小子是你  你妹妹
The Mosby Boys were you, your sister,

170
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,990
和小区的一只你自以为驯服了的松鼠
and a neighborhood squirrel you thought you had tamed.

171
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,650
不敢相信松洛克・福尔摩斯会攻击我们
I can't believe Squirrel-lock Holmes turned on us like that.

172
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,720
八周的训练付之一炬
Eight weeks of training down the drain.

173
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,740
你知道我怎么知道的吗  泰德
You know how I know that, Ted?

174
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,880
我们在六年前交往时
Because we covered it in the "getting to know you" part

175
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,300
在"了解对方"的过程中谈到的
of the relationship six years ago.

176
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,270
六年了
Six years.

177
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,700
那是什么让我们停滞不前
Then... what's holding us back?

178
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,360
召回莫斯比小子吧  泰德
Call in the Mosby Boys, Ted,

179
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,850
破案后告诉我
let me know if they crack the case.

180
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,000
伙计们
Guys,

181
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,850
把尼不仅是我交过最棒的兄弟
Brover is not only the best bro I've ever had,

182
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,470
他还对姑娘们很有一套
he's amazing with the ladies.

183
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,270
抱歉  你不觉得用一条狗去勾搭妹子
I'm sorry, don't you think it's a little pathetic

184
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,190
有点可悲吗
to use a dog to pick up chicks?

185
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,700
先生  泡妞搭档是相互帮忙的
Sir, wingmanship is a two-way street.

186
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,300
如果把尼看到靓狗  我会替他挡一刀
If Brover meets a cutie, I'll take the hit

187
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,960
引开胖乎乎的狗闺蜜
and chat up the chubby lady friend.

188
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,730
有时我会充当坏蛋
Sometimes I'll be the jerk...

189
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,260
好让把尼上演英雄救美的把戏
...so Brover can swoop in and be the hero.

190
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,930
如同所有的泡妞搭档一样
And like any good wingman,

191
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,960
我会在前线尽可能地多收集情报
I gather as much intel as I can right up front.

192
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,830
你的狗多大
How old's your dog?

193
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,170
五岁
She's five.

194
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,500
按狗龄来算呢
What's that in dog years?

195
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,290
差不多35岁吧
Like, 35.

196
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,610
那我们走了
We're done here.

197
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,650
你们说对了
Well, you were right.

198
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,600
维多利亚说有事让我们停滞不前
Victoria says something's holding us back,

199
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,680
而我却浑然不知
and I don't have any idea what it is.

200
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,730
有什么高见吗  奥普拉
Any brilliant insights, Oprah?

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,920
斯特德曼[奥普拉的老公]
Steadman?

202
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,610
说我盖尔吧[奥普拉的女性好友]
Um, try Gayle.

203
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,330
马修  这次你来吧
Marshall, I want you to take this one.

204
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,690
你准备好了
You're ready.

205
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,470
我不确定
Oh, I don't know.

206
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,250
尽管我听到脑后有股微小的声音
Although I do hear this little voice in the back of my head

207
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,700
试图告诉我些什么
trying to tell me something.

208
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,990
那你是内心的女神
That's your inner goddess.

209
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,000
聆听她的话  传达她的主旨
Listen to her, channel her.

210
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,640
如果维多利亚就像炎热的七月里的
If Victoria quenches your thirst like a tall glass

211
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,870
一杯香甜的茶  让你解渴...
of sweet tea on a hot July day...

212
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,950
马修  为什么她有南方口音
Marshall, why is she Southern?

213
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,730
别让他中断和女神的联系
Don't let him break the connection.

214
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,950
你该让她说出真实想法
...well, you got to make an honest woman out of her.

215
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,900
好了  我走了
Okay, I'm leaving.

216
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,950
但  但
But, but,

217
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,790
如果做不到  甜心
if not, well, then, sugar...

218
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,820
你就该让那只夜莺
...you got to let that nightingale

219
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,560
展翅高飞
spread her wings and soar

220
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,100
飞向自己美好明天
to her own beautiful tomorrow.

221
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,320
此言有理
Testify.

222
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,980
你们烂爆了
You guys are the worst.

223
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,810
我人在哪里
Where am I?

224
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
抱歉
Sorry.

225
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
我是巴尼
Uh, go for Barney.

226
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,260
明白
I see.

227
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,050
完全理解
Totally understood.

228
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
包在我身上
I'll do that.

229
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,250
棒极了
Great.

230
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,770
谢谢你哦
Thank you.

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,730
电话是"把你"的主人打来的
That was Brover's owner.

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,740
估计是她出远门不在家时
I guess, while she was out of town,

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,320
"把你"逃了出来
he ran away from his kennel,

234
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,270
现在她回来了  我得把他还回去
and now that she's back, I have to return him.

235
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,890
巴尼  真遗憾
Oh, Barney, I'm so sorry.

236
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,180
没事没事
Oh, it's all good.

237
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,660
请容许我离开一下
Um, excuse me for one moment.

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,650
巴尼
Hey, Barney.

239
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,460
苍天啊  为什么
No, no. No, no!

240
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,860
什么
Wha...

241
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,010
维多利亚
Victoria.

242
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,720
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

243
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,600
愿意  当然愿意
Yes, of course.

244
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,630
不过还有一件事
There's just one thing.

245
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,300
什么事  尽管说
Anything. You name it.

246
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,380
你得跟罗宾绝交
You can't be friends with Robin.

247
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,030
除非我和罗宾绝交
You won't marry me

248
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,210
否则你就不会嫁给我吗
if I'm still friends with Robin?

249
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,190
等等  她就是令我俩关系停滞不前的原因吗
Wait. She's the thing that's been holding us back?

250
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,650
你们之间有太多的过去了
There-There's just too much history there.

251
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,630
我们第一次分手就是因为罗宾
I mean, Robin's the reason that we broke up the first time around.

252
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,140
罗宾是我们之间的路障
Robin's our roadblock.

253
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,210
罗宾是个伸手不见五指的大深坑
Robin's the deep, dark pit

254
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,690
我们的关系一掉进去就得死
where our relationship goes to die.

255
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,230
不过她是世界上最好的姑娘  优秀公民
But nicest girl in the world. Salt of the earth.

256
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
可她现在已经有尼克了
But she's with Nick now.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,810
虽然  他的厨艺秀挺烂的
I mean, sure, his cooking show is lousy

258
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,990
老是说些奇怪的口号
with awkward catchphrase attempts.

259
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,060
我勒个去呀  谁想要吃呀
Oh, my gosh, who's ready to nosh?

260
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,770
谁想打爆白鲑肚子  来点里面的蛆呀
Who's popping a chub for some grub?

261
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,840
关于那个"打爆白鲑肚子"的发言
I offer my deepest apologies

262
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,270
我对对此不满的观众表示深深的歉意
to anyone who was offended by my "Popping a chub" remark.

263
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
我会改进改善
I can and will do better.

264
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,460
保证不犯同样的错了
Won't happen again.

265
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,550
那么现在  谁想要吃我的肉啊
And now who's ready to eat my meat?

266
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,910
不会吧
Oh, come on.

267
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,070
可罗宾和尼克在一起很开心
But Robin's happy with Nick,

268
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,400
我和你在一起也很开心
and I'm happy with you.

269
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,770
你看  我刚才都向你求婚了
Look, I, i just asked you to be my wife.

270
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,430
这不就证明我和罗宾之间没什么了吗
Isn't that proof there's nothing between me and Robin?

271
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,050
也许今天你们之间没有
Well, maybe today there isn't,

272
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,730
可谁能保证明天
but what about tomorrow?

273
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,710
下周  或15年后会不会有呢
Or next week or 15 years from now?

274
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,880
我会一直怀疑你俩
I'll always be wondering.

275
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,100
我从不想当那种会说出
I never wanted to be that girl who says

276
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,980
"选罗宾还是我"的女生
it's Robin or it's me,

277
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,590
但是
but, well...

278
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,460
我必须做出抉择
It's Robin or it's you.

279
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,320
你真是最棒的泡妞搭档
You've been a hell of a wingman.

280
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,010
就算你舔自己私处的时候
And even though I think it's kind of gross

281
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,130
我觉得有点恶心
when you pleasure yourself orally,

282
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,280
但我也是深深被你震惊了
don't ever think that means I'm not impressed.

283
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,030
你觉得巴尼能够自己
Do you think that Barney's gonna be okay

284
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,070
把"把你"还回去吗
bringing Brover back?

285
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,240
他当然可以了
Yeah, he'll be fine.

286
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,010
这不光是你"取悦"自己的能力
It's not just the ability to go to town on yourself,

287
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,050
而是你那兴致勃勃的态度
but you do it with such joie de vivre.

288
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,050
我还是觉得我应该陪他一起去
I really think that I should go with him.

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,430
可你必须趁着热
No, but you got to eat these crpes

290
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,040
尝尝这些法式薄饼
as soon as they're flambed.

291
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,830
一定会甜到忧伤的
They're gonna be bon appe-sweet!

292
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,130
-烂  -靠
- No. - Damn.

293
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,870
等我回来我们再吃吧
We'll work on it when I get back.

294
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,900
不  我明白
No, I get it.

295
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,450
虽然我一整晚都在忙这个
You know, I only spent all night working on these,

296
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,070
但显然巴尼更重要
but, hey, Barney's more important.

297
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,810
-尼克  -没事  你走吧
- Nick... - It's fine. Go.

298
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,930
总之  也别搞得像生离死别了
Anyway, let's not make a big deal of it.

299
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,890
我们一起玩了几天
We hung out for a few days,

300
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,170
过了些好日子
had some fun...

301
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,940
不值得一提
No big woof.

302
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,940
我不会忘了你的

303
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,360
没有你  我什么都不是
I don't know who I am without you.

304
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,170
真是太扯了
This is crazy.

305
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,030
维多利亚对于罗宾这事简直在胡搅蛮缠
Victoria is being completely unreasonable about Robin,

306
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,580
我的击掌好姐妹一定会同意我
and my snap sister is gonna back me up.

307
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,340
我再说一次
I say again...

308
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,720
我比较能理解维多利亚的想法
I kind of see Victoria's point.

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,150
再说一遍  大软糖夫人
Come again for Ms. Fudge?

310
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,390
泰德和罗宾有太多的过去了
Ted and Robin have so much history.

311
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,470
没错  都是过去  老早的事了
Exactly. History. Ancient history.

312
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,340
泰德  今年早些时候你还对她说过"我爱你"呢
Ted, you said "I love you" to her earlier this year.

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,300
我没说这事公平  但我能理解她
I'm not saying this is fair, but I get it.

314
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,670
我完全不能理解
I didn't get that at all.

315
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,810
我怎么感应不到我内心的女神了
How could my inner goddess be so far off?

316
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,430
你总有一天会感应到的  亲爱的
Oh, you'll get there, honey.

317
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,540
奥普拉不是一天建成的
Oprah wasn't built in a day.

318
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,700
怎么了
What?

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,980
我早先乱来了
I kind of went rogue.

320
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,810
你如果真的很想怀孕
Look, if you really want to have a baby,

321
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,620
那就别吃避孕药了
just stop taking the pill.

322
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,270
你们在3年前的春假滚过床单
You guys slept together at spring break three years ago.

323
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,570
你们绝对是有感情的
That means something.

324
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,670
喜欢舞台剧音乐
Loves show tunes,

325
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,350
完全是购物狂
total shopaholic,

326
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,540
对做爱不敢兴趣
not always pestering you for sex?

327
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,060
克利福德听起来很值得长相守嘛
Um, Clifford sounds like a keeper.

328
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,060
以上都是同性恋爱做的事

329
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,170
马修  你的这些建议都糟透了
Marshall, all of that advice was terrible.

330
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,290
至少比你说
Not as terrible as you saying

331
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,160
"泰德和罗宾应该绝交"要好一点
that Ted and Robin should stop being friends.

332
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,340
我没说要他们绝交  那也太可怕了
I'm not saying they should. It would be horrible.

333
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,100
但如果泰德真的想要和维多利亚在一起
But if Ted really wants to be with Victoria...

334
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,410
泰德  告诉她你不会和罗宾绝交
Ted, tell her that you're not gonna stop being friends with Robin.

335
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,650
我无法想象没有罗宾的生活
I can't imagine life without Robin.

336
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,780
但她不可能会爱上我
But she'll never be in love with me.

337
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,040
也不会陪我共度余生
She'll never be my wife.

338
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,120
她永远不会是与我相伴到老的那个人
She'll never be the person I grow old with.

339
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,640
维多利亚
Victoria...

340
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,270
维多利亚有可能是
Victoria could be.

341
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
你说的和我想的一样吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

342
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,370
准备好告别了吗
You ready to say good-bye?

343
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,380
多谢你陪我一起来
Thanks for coming with me.

344
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,200
我当年送走我的狗时
Oh, well, you did the same for me

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,400
你也帮我了  还记得吗
back when I had to give away all my dogs. Remember?

346
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,410
我们开车到州北你阿姨的农场
Oh, yeah, we drove to your aunt's farm upstate.

347
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,700
她帅呆了
She was awesome.

348
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,490
我喜欢她这个年老充满智慧
Yeah. I love how she was this wise, old,

349
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,740
淡定的女同志农场主
chilled out, lesbian farmer.

350
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,730
才不是  她不是同性恋
No, no, no. She's not a lesbian.

351
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,170
她的农场也没养女同志
Nor does she farm them.

352
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,240
不  那个和她住在一起的女人
No, that woman she lives with,

353
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,730
只是她的特殊好友莫林
that's just her special friend Maureen.

354
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,290
她们住在一起...
They've lived together for...

355
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,240
真舍不得他
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

356
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,310
"把你"真的是史上最棒的泡妞搭档
Brover really was the best wingman ever.

357
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,120
我的天
Oh, my God.

358
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,610
多谢你把
Thank you so much for bringing

359
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,870
-点点先生送回来  -点点先生
- Mr. Sprinkles back. - Mr. Sprinkles...

360
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,020
真是好听的狗名字
is a great name for a dog.

361
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,200
妈咪好想你哦
Mommy missed you so much.

362
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,350
好想哦
Yes, she did.

363
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,460
是这对好心小夫妻照顾你的吗
Did this nice couple take care of you?

364
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,740
真搞笑
That's a laugh.

365
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,280
大兄弟
Big bro.

366
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,970
我得走了  我得...
I got to split. Yeah, I got to,

367
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,970
我得回到我的农场
I got to head back to the farm...

368
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,330
我和我特殊好友莫林住在那里
where I live with my special friend Maureen.

369
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,380
现在我意识到她是我的同性恋终生伴侣
Whom I now realize is my lesbian life partner.

370
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,460
惊喜
Surprise.

371
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,970
好了  我走了
Okay. All right.

372
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,810
你想进来喝一杯吗
So... would you like a drink?

373
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,440
史上最棒的泡妞搭档
Best wingman ever.

374
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,220
这是什么情况
What's all this?

375
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,970
我以为你在生我的气呢
I thought you were mad at me.

376
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,640
之前是的
I was...

377
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,360
但后来我意识到
but then I realized

378
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,160
我必须接受你有亲密的男性朋友这一事实
I just have to accept that you have close guy friends.

379
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,710
不过我可不想让这成为习惯
I mean, I don't want it becoming a habit

380
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,520
让他们在大半夜的把你从我身边偷走
that they steal you away from me in the middle of the night.

381
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,560
但是
But...

382
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,270
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

383
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,840
泰德要见我
Oh, Ted needs to see me.

384
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
有没有搞错啊  女人
Oh, for the love of God, woman.

385
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
不是你想的那样  他只是想约炮
Oh, it's not what you think. He just wants to have sex.

386
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,010
开玩笑的
Kidding.

387
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,990
只要用手帮他就行了
Just a little hand stuff.

388
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,320
还是玩笑
Kidding again.

389
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,860
泰德其实更喜欢用胸  我这嘴停不下啊
Ted's more of a boob man. I seriously can't stop.

390
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,190
他有什么事
What does he want?

391
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,780
不知道  但他说是急事
I don't know, but he says it's urgent.

392
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,820
真是对不起
I'm so sorry.

393
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,420
我再被偷走一下下就好
Just one more little steal-away.

394
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,900
只要他把你还给我就行
Just as long as he gives you back.

395
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,890
谢谢
Thanks.

396
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,800
那么
So...

397
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,420
你还好吗
are you okay?

398
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,490
是什么的紧急大事件
What is this big, urgent thing

399
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,310
不可以等到明天再说
that couldn't wait till tomorrow?

400
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,550
有件事我必须得告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

401
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,220
我想了很多很多
I've thought about this a ton, and, um...

402
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,810
我希望结果不是这样  但是...
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but...

403
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,390
我不爱罗宾
I'm not in love with Robin, um,

404
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,730
但她就像我的家人
but she's like family to me, and, uh...

405
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,180
我没法断掉这份情
I can't end that.

406
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,890
所以
So...

407
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,890
你能接受吗
can you accept that?

408
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,180
我真心希望有一天你能得到她的心
I really hope you get her some day.

409
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,760
伙计们
Hey, guys.

410
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,240
昨天晚上
So, last night

411
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,350
泰德叫我去酒吧谈一件紧急事
Ted calls me out to the bar to talk about something urgent.

412
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,070
猜猜是什么
Guess what it was.

413
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,800
他想写一部年轻人的系列侦探小说
He wants to write a series of young adult mystery novels

414
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,140
书名为《莫斯比小子》
called The Mosby Boys.

415
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,620
你为什么要告诉我这个
Why did you need to tell me that?

416
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,820
你是媒体界人士  你有人脉
You work in the media. You know people.

417
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,080
首先  不要写莫斯比家两呆子
Okay, well, first of all, lose the Mosby nerds

418
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,900
聚焦在能破案的松鼠上
and focus on that crime-solving squirrel.

419
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,520
写它绝对书能大卖
That guy is gold.

420
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,420
第二  下次
And secondly, next time

421
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,950
你在深夜有了什么好点子
you have a big idea late at night,

422
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,890
请你去烦你的女朋友
please bug your girlfriend about it.

423
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,320
事实上
Uh, actually...

424
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,540
维多利亚和我分手了
Victoria and I broke up.

425
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,040
我的天
Oh, my God.

426
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,190
为什么  出什么事了
Why, what, what happened?

427
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,330
我们只是理念不同
We just, you know, wanted different things.

428
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,210
太遗憾了  哥们
I'm so sorry, buddy.

429
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,270
但往好的方面看
But, bright side...

430
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,340
罗宾知道你因为她
Robin is gonna be so touched

431
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,070
和维多利亚分手  她会非常感动的
when she hears you ended things with Victoria because of her.

432
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,500
永远不能让她知道
She can never know.

433
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,510
你们要保证永远不会告诉罗宾
Promise me Robin will never find out.

434
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,720
我不明白
I don't understand.

435
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,820
保证
Promise.

436
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,570
-我保证  -我保证
- Promise. - Promise.

437
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,980
<i>当然  罗宾后来知道了</i>
<i>Of course, Robin did find out.</i>

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,380
<i>这个以后再说</i>
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

439
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,480
兄弟  救命

440
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,390
一个疯婆子说我搞大了她的肚子

441
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,920
原来你的蛋蛋还留着啊
So you do have balls.

442
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,920
快跑
Run.
