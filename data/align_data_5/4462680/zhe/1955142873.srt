The medical records are plainly relevant,

即這些原告人并不能充分代表集體訴訟
the plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives.

- Nothing more. - ‭How so?

如果強迫他們公開這部分信息
and by forcing them to reveal this information,

154
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:53,424

00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,224
你是說他們沒有行為能力嗎
you're saying they're incompetent?

159
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,594
我是說為了集體訴訟確認
I'm saying we have the right to any record

00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,354
我們有權獲得證明原告
that would speak to their competency,

162

No, no. That is not what we're...

but too incompetent to sue.

170
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:21,924
這不是很矛盾嗎
So which is it?

171
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:24,634
許多居住者是很多年前簽署合同的
Many of the residents signed their contracts years ago,

172
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:27,014
那時候他們完全有行為能力
and at the time, ‭they were perfectly competent.

173
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,764
但這是會變的
But that can change,

174
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,494
尤其是年歲已高的居住者
especially when we're talking about elderly individuals.

175
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:34,374
那么也許磯鷂渡專挑有精神疾病的老年人
Or maybe sandpiper preyed on mentally incompetent seniors

176
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,544
騙走了他們的錢財
and bilked them out of their money.

177
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:36,534
韋克斯勒小姐
Miss Wexler.

178
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,474
我只是在為我方委托人辯護
I am simply trying to defend our clients

179
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,344
免受被告方欺壓
from bullying by the defense.

180
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,864
法官大人  正如您面前的報告中所述
Your honor, as stated in the brief in front of you,

181
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,474
這是個標準申請
this is a standard request,

182
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:48,244
在同類案件中均被允許
granted in every case of its kind.

183
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:50,234
這不是欺壓
This is not about bullying.

184
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,724
允許這樣的隱私侵犯
Granting this invasion of privacy

185
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,174
會讓我們的委托人二次受害
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.

186
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,774
我請求拒絕被告的動議  法官大人
I ask that you deny the defense's motion, your honor.

187
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,524
我傾向于允許這一申請
I'm leaning toward granting the motion,

188
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,964
但我想重讀一下訴狀和簡述
but I would like to review the pleadings and briefs again.

189
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,294
我會很快答復你們
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

190
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,704
休庭
Adjourned.

191
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,104
回辦公室再見
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

192
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:26,284
韋克斯勒小姐  你好
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

193
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:28,464
我只想說  你剛才表現很好
I just wanted to say, good work in there.

194
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,034
謝謝  但我肯定輸了
Thanks, but I -- I'm pretty sure I lost.

195
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,194
當然了  這種情況你贏不了的
Oh, of course you did. It's an unwinnable position.

196
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,194
所以你上司都懶得出面
That's why your boss didn't bother showing up.

197
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,904
但是你堅持不懈  雖敗猶榮  我很欣賞
But you went down swinging, and I admire that.

198
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:40,704
謝謝
Thank you.

199
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,464
你午餐有什么安排
What are you doing for lunch?

200
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,794
可能就在自動販賣機買點吧
Um, probably just grabbing something from the vending machines.

201
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,124
我們可以吃好一點嘛
We can do better than that.

202
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:53,064
斯韋卡特先生  很高興見到你
Mr. Schweikart, good to see you, sir.

203
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,774
-你好嗎  肖恩  -我很好
- Ah, how you doing, Sean? ‭- Very well.

204
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:57,604
要什么喝的  您還是要莫斯科之騾嗎
Can I get some drinks for you two? Your usual Moscow Mule?

205
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,584
肯定的  你要嗎
Absolutely. You want one?

206
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,384
全市最好的莫斯科之騾
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

207
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:05,994
新鮮的生姜  純銅杯  很正宗
Fresh ginger, ‭real copper mug, the works.

208
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,174
真是復古  我不用了
That's very vintage, but I'm good.

209
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,304
冰茶就可以了
Just an iced tea.

210
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,404
你確定嗎
You sure?

211
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:13,844
那好吧  我就獨自做一個
All right, then. I'll be the sole degenerate

212
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:15,664
工作日中午喝酒的墮落漢吧
who's drinking ‭in the middle of a work day.

213
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,804
那也是復古了
That, too, is vintage.

214
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,064
我去讓他們調
I'll get those started.

215
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,964
所以你在哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所十年了
So, you've been with HHM, what -- 10 years?

216
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,244
沒錯  去年八月滿十年
Y-yeah, last August.

217
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,754
你是從收發室做起的嗎
And you started in the mail room?

218
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,704
沒錯  我在那干了六年
I did. I was six years there.

219
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:34,724
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

220
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,734
我問別人的  這地方很小
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

221
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,444
聽上去你已經盡職盡責了
You know, it sounds like you certainly paid your dues.

222
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,504
我運氣很好
I was very fortunate.

223
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:43,764
律所一邊讓我工作  一邊供我讀完法學院
HHM put me through law school while I worked.

224
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:45,944
他們很會培養人才
That's great that ‭they foster talent like that.

225
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:47,734
現在你給他們工作  就當還債是吧
And I imagine you're paying it off as part of your deal?

226
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:48,984
是的  我很樂意
Yeah, happily.

227
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,024
好多人都是這樣的安排
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

228
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:53,714
我得說  今天看你在法庭上
I have to say, ‭watching you in court today,

229
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,034
確實勾起我不少回憶
it sure did bring back some old memories for me.

230
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:58,114
反正讓我想起了一件事
One in particular, anyway.

231
00:16:58,594 --> 00:16:59,194
-是嗎  -是的
- Yeah? - ‭Yeah.

232
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:01,754
我當時從法學院畢業一年  在波士頓一家律所
I was a year out of law school at this firm in Boston,

233
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,904
我終于接了第一個大案子
and I was finally put on my first big case --

234
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,724
一樁大型就業歧視案
This huge ‭employment-discrimination suit.

235
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,664
這案子讓律所十年都有活干
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.

236
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,524
總之  我們接了這單大的
Anyway, we landed this monster,

237
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,094
而且我成為了預審聽證時
and I find out I'm second chair to one of the partners

238
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:15,384
一位合伙人的助理律師
on the preliminary hearing,

239
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:18,234
我就想  "就是它了
and I think, "This is it.

240
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,724
"我之后的職業生涯全靠這一搏了"
"This is what will define the rest of my career."

241
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:23,714
聽證會越來越近
So, the hearing's getting closer and closer,

242
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,564
我甚至買了一件負擔不起的西裝
I even get this new suit that I can't afford --

243
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:27,414
我分三張信用卡刷的
I split it over three credit cards.

244
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,284
可能現在還在還錢
I'm probably still paying it off to this day.

245
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:34,204
我一大早就去了  穿著我的新西裝
So, I go in bright and early, I'm wearing my new suit,

246
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:37,014
準備桌上的材料  這時抗辯方走進來
prepping my table, and in walks the opposing counsel.

247
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,324
他們有四個人  一個高級合伙人
There's four of them -- one senior partner

248
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,984
還有三個高級律師
and three high-level associates.

249
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,704
我還沒出生他們就干這行了
These guys have been litigating longer than I've been alive.

250
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:48,584
但我想的是  "我很優秀
But I think, "Mm, I'm good.

251
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,484
"我老板來了就沒事了"
"I got my boss coming. It'll be fine."

252
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,994
我就一個人坐在桌前
So, I'm sitting alone, at my table,

253
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:55,874
等著老板現身
waiting for my boss to show.

254
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:57,774
我等啊等
And I'm waiting.

255
00:17:58,354 --> 00:17:59,224
等啊等
And I'm waiting.

256
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,544
突然  他們宣布開庭
And then, suddenly, ‭they're calling us to order,

257
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,514
我才意識到我的律所沒人來
and I realize that no one from my firm is coming.

258
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:05,614
只有我一個
It's just me.

259
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,024
我心想  "好吧
So I think, "All right, then.

260
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:09,644
"是時候了"
"This is the moment."

261
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,754
我上前拼了老命地辯論
And I get up there, and I argue like my life depended on it.

262
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,974
汗流浹背  旁征博引
I'm sweating, and I'm citing statutes left and right.

263
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:18,814
我表現得還行
And I'm doing okay. Respectable.

264
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:22,084
但我這把BB槍難敵四架榴彈炮
But I'm just a BB gun to these four howitzers.

265
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:26,354
我當然輸了
And I lose, of course.

266
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,204
這不可避免
It was inevitable.

267
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,734
但之后我突然意識到
But later, it hit me

268
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:33,294
我的老板根本就沒打算到場
that my boss never intended to show.

269
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,464
他們都一笑而過
And they all laughed about it.

270
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,304
拍著我背說  那是對我的考驗
They patted me on the back, said it was my trial by fire,

271
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:41,074
我也跟他們一起笑  但你知道
and I laughed with them, but, you know,

272
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,474
我覺得很不好受
It never really sat well with me.

273
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,194
你需要他們的支持
You want them to have your back.

274
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:48,684
因為最后我才知道
Because at the end of the day,

275
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,954
那不是為了考驗我的勇氣
it wasn't about proving my mettle.

276
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,214
而是我老板不想錯過高爾夫
My boss had a tee time that he didn't want to miss.

277
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,884
我在那兒沒待多久
I wasn't there long.

278
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:06,014
可以問下你為什么叫我...來這嗎
Could I ask why we... are here?

279
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:09,914
我已經注意你很久了
You know, I've had my eye on you for a while.

280
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,224
自從凱特爾曼一案開始
Since that Kettleman thing.

281
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:13,444
你真是為他搞定了一樁極好的案子
That was an excellent deal you got for him.

282
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:16,214
我想知道為什么
And I'm wondering why someone

283
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:18,214
一個可以搞定那一單的人
who could put together a deal like that

284
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:21,834
沒有后援  明知要輸  卻還要辯護
is arguing a losing position with no backup.

285
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,334
我對哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所沒有怨言
I have no complaints about HHM.

286
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:26,984
很好
That's great.

287
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:32,354
然而  如果你碰巧正在尋求改變
However, if on the off chance, if you're pondering a change,

288
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,164
斯韋卡特考科利會很樂意
Schweikart and Cokely would be more than happy

289
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,894
善用你的才華
to put your talents to good use.

290
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,624
當然我們得有更正式的會面
Of course, we'd have to have a more formal meeting,

291
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,854
討論細節  但我們認為你會非常合適
work out specifics, but we think you would be a great fit.

292
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,244
我受寵若驚
Well, I'm -- I'm flattered,

293
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,794
但這明顯存在職業道德問題
but there's clearly an ethical issue here.

294
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,784
當然是等你弄完磯鷂渡的案子
Well, of course, ‭we'd take you off Sandpiper.

295
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:54,794
你放心
And rest assured,

296
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,654
我們不想要哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的
we wouldn't be expecting any information

297
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,724
任何策略信息
about HHM strategy.

298
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:01,634
我們是一家大規模多元化的律所
Look, we're a large, diversified firm.

299
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,894
想想你可以用我們的資源做什么
And just think what you can do with our resources

300
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,474
可以自由地展翅翱翔
and the freedom ‭to really spread your wings.

301
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:12,604
這...
That's...

302
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,924
我虧欠哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所很多
I owe a lot to HHM.

303
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:18,764
學費債務嗎  我們可以替你償還
Your tuition debt? ‭We can take care of that.

304
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:22,014
真慷慨
That's very generous.

305
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:25,944
花點時間去考慮一下
Well, give it some time to think about it.

306
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,844
你來電話  我們就安排會面
And you give me a call, and we'll set up a meeting

307
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,544
會見其他高級合伙人
with the rest of the senior partners.

308
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:32,144
先說清楚...
And to be clear...

309
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:34,884
我說的可是合伙人機會
I'm talking partner track.

310
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,424
天哪肖恩  你是在莫斯科調的酒嗎
Jesus, Sean, what -- what'd you have to send to Moscow?

311
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,584
抱歉讓您久等了  斯韋卡特先生
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Schweikart.

312
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:42,534
可以點餐了嗎
Are we ready to order?

some way for people to hook up with each other using the internet?

464
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,357
聽著  我相信你是個好人
Oh, look, I'm sure you're a nice guy,

465
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:10,077
但她其實是亂說的
but she was talking out of school.

466
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:13,387
-我們...這個項目人滿了  -好吧
- We're -- we're full up on this thing. - ‭Oh. Oh, okay.

467
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,147
我們再簽下一名投資商
We sign one more investor,

468
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,637
就該上市了  我只是...
we got to go public, and I'm just...

469
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:19,177
不
No.

470
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,977
我們人已經滿了
We cannot take anyone else on.

471
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,187
無意冒犯
No offense.

472
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:26,307
沒關系
Oh, it's okay. Yeah.

473
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,677
不用擔心
No worries.

474
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,787
張開手臂
Spread your arms.

475
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:38,247
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}他戴了竊聽器嗎

476
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:38,817
沒有
No.

477
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:42,377
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}沒有竊聽器  但...

478
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:43,467
他有一把槍
He's got a gun.

479
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:45,917
我不在乎槍
I don't care about the gun.

480
00:38:39,937 --> 00:38:43,827
明天  你去找地檢官
Tomorrow, ‭you go to the district attorney,

481
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:49,277
向他解釋我侄子的槍是你的
and you explain to him that my nephew's gun was yours.

482
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,637
地檢會問你
The D.A. will ask you,

483
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:54,227
"你為什么之前不說"
"Why you didn't say anything before?"

484
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:58,207
你跟他說你忘了  你嚇壞了...
You tell him you forgot, you were rattled --

485
00:38:58,207 --> 00:38:59,337
隨便你編什么理由
Make up anything you want.

486
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,007
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

487
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,747
但這是你的槍
But it's your gun.

488
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:08,197
我們來談談我的報酬吧
Let's discuss my payment.

489
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:10,137
晚了
Mm, that time is past.

490
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,987
五千塊飛了
No $5,000 for you.

491
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:13,727
我要五萬
The price is $50,000.

492
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:16,407
報酬是活著出去怎么樣
How about the payment is you get to live?

493
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:18,617
不夠
Not enough.

494
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,807
你覺得你有資格跟我談條件嗎
Oh, you think ‭you can negotiate with me?

495
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:23,907
只要我一句話
I say the word,

496
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,217
我的侄子們就會去汽車旅館
my nephews go to a certain motel,

497
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:28,547
拜訪你的兒媳
pay a visit to your daughter-in-law

498
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,867
和你的小孫女
and your little granddaughter.

499
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,187
你覺得接下來會怎么樣
What do you think happens then?

500
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:38,287
好好考慮考慮你的處境
Consider your position carefully.

501
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,657
要么給我錢
I get my money...

502
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,077
要么我們倆都別想活著走出這里
or neither of us walk out of here.

503
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,657
你為了這個連命都不要了嗎
You willing to die for this?

504
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:02,687
或許我比你更需要那五萬塊吧
Maybe I need the $50,000 more than you do.

505
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:13,327
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我早說了吧

506
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:16,237
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}夠膽兒

507
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:20,647
你說話這么欠是怎么活到現在的
How you manage to live so long with a mouth like that, hmm?

508
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,027
五萬塊
$50,000.

509
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:32,267
槍是你的
And the gun is yours.

510
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:12,187
他派你來的嗎
He sent you?

511
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:13,457
我主動要來的
I volunteered.

512
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:16,547
只有這樣說話才安全
Only safe way for us to talk.

513
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,557
你剛才在那太得寸進尺了
You really pushed it in there.

514
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:42,647
我們干的那事
That thing we did...

515
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:46,777
一旦被他發現  我們倆都必死無疑
...he finds out, we're both dead.

516
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:48,217
這你清楚的吧
You get that, right?

517
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:51,297
我們干什么了
What thing we did?

518
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:58,297
這是干嘛
What's this?

519
00:41:58,297 --> 00:41:59,677
兩萬五
$25,000.

520
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:00,847
為什么要給我
What for?

521
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:02,757
我們達成了協議
We made a deal.

522
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,657
而我搞砸了
I didn't hold up my end.

523
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:10,507
你的麻煩很快就要出來了  比我們預計的更快
Your problem is coming back sooner than we expected.

524
00:42:20,177 --> 00:42:24,997
{\an8}克拉多克海事銀行
大北極公司

525
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:29,877
你要把錢提出來嗎
You gonna cash that?

526
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:31,677
我認識個人  他或許能幫忙
I might know a guy who can help.

527
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:34,797
還是把它當成紀念品吧
It's better as a souvenir.

528
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:39,397
我以為你今天早上可能會  我也不知道
I figured you'd be maybe -- I don't know --

529
00:42:39,897 --> 00:42:41,547
稍微開心一點
a touch happier this morning.

530
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,867
就算只有那么一點點
Maybe a smidge, possibly?

531
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,447
我很開心  非常開心
I am. I'm totally happy.

532
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:47,947
為什么會不開心
Why wouldn't I be?

533
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:51,487
我
I, uh...

534
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:54,957
我收到了一個工作邀請
I had a job offer.

535
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:58,347
真的嗎  哪家律所
Really? From where?

536
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:01,007
斯韋卡特考科利
Schweikart and Cokely.

537
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:02,867
真的假的
Seriously?

538
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:04,437
里奇·斯韋卡特甚至還說愿意幫我償還
Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off

539
00:43:04,437 --> 00:43:06,027
法學院的貸款
my law-school loans.

540
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:08,187
太棒了
That's great.

541
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:10,477
你向霍華德辭職的時候請叫上我
Please let me be there when you tell Howard.

542
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:11,647
拜托了
Please.

543
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:13,947
那為什么還一臉憂傷
So why the sad puppy eyes?

544
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:15,447
你不想要那個工作嗎
What, you don't want that job?

545
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:17,097
不不  我當然想要
No, no, o-of course I do.

546
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,477
我是說  誰會拒絕這樣的機會  是吧
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

547
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:19,927
這是家大律所
It's a huge firm.

548
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:21,607
你再也不用在霍華德手下受氣
You get out ‭from under Howard's thumb.

549
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,337
是啊  就是
Right. Exactly.

550
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,817
而且  反正我在哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
Besides, HHM is looking more and more like

551
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:27,237
越來越沒有前途
a dead end for me, anyway.

552
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:29,927
就是啊  所以還有什么問題嗎
Exactly. So what's the problem?

553
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:32,417
我只是
I just...

554
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,057
我也不知道
I don't know.

555
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,127
我一直在想你漂在那個池子里的場景
I keep thinking of you floating in that pool.

556
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:48,657
你知道你想要什么  可我成了你的障礙
You knew what you wanted, but I got in the way.

557
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:50,777
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

558
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,117
你進戴維斯梅因律所是為了我
You took the Davis & Main job because of me.

559
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:58,537
我去那里工作是因為這是正確的選擇
I took that job because it was the right decision.

560
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:00,617
穩定的收入  有了
A steady paycheck -- done.

561
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:04,917
比原來不知道大到哪里去的住處  也有了
A place to live that's more than, oh, 5 square feet -- boom.

562
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:07,917
純色的汽車  到手了
A car that's all one color -- nailed it.

563
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:09,407
我日子很好過
‭I'm good.

564
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:10,917
我得到了我想要的
I got what I wanted.

565
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,777
而你  等你進了那什么斯韋卡特
And you, ‭with the Schweikart thing?

566
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:14,747
你就可以得到你想要的一切
You could have ‭everything you ever wanted.

567
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:17,157
還有什么不滿意的
What's not to love about that?

568
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:20,457
是啊
Yeah.

569
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:22,537
還有什么不滿意的
What's not to love?
