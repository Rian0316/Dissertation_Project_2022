1
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,254
There's a gentlemen
downstairs...

2
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,926
Ask him to wait a
moment, Mrs. Hudson.

3
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,928
He's most insistent.

4
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,560
Easy now. Easy.

5
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,105
I must apologize.

6
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,482
l have been a
little overwrought.

7
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,945
I'm a doctor, sir, and I must insist
that you relax yourself and say nothing

8
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,071
until you have eaten.

9
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,992
Thank you. If I might have
a biscuit and a glass of milk,

10
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,660
I have no doubt
I should soon be better.

11
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,246
Mrs. Hudson is preparing
something at this moment.

12
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,417
Please, please, please
forgive this weakness.

13
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,044
l really must...

14
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,421
Mr. Holmes.

15
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,757
At your service.

16
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,179
Master of arts.
Doctor of Philosophy.

17
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,890
Principal of the Priory School.
Is it not everyday,

18
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,268
Doctor Huxtable, that so distinguished
a castaway as yourself is

19
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,437
beached upon on the hearthrug.

20
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,607
In speculating what storm
had blown you here

21
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,860
l took the liberty of searching
your person, l hope you will forgive me.

22
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,737
Oh yes, yes of course.

23
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,198
Please sit down.

24
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,866
Your watch.

25
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,077
Unblemished for at
least thirty years,

26
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,121
suddenly this morning scratched.

27
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,499
When you thrust those coins,

28
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,584
unthinkingly into
your waistcoat pocket.

29
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,463
The stern habit of a lifetime
trampled under foot.

30
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,175
A small occurrence perhaps
but own small think

31
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:25,180
in a way that a vibrating needle
may signal an earthquake

32
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,143
The state of your beard demonstrates
a considerable disruption to your routine.

33
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,144
Three days ago?

34
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,438
Just so.

35
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,735
Mr. Holmes, I beg you to accompany me
north to Mackleton immediately.

36
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,446
A matter of the
utmost importance.

37
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,490
I regret.

38
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,495
Doctor Watson and I are extremely
pressed just at the moment.

39
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,374
I'm retained in the case of
the Ferrers Documents, and

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,543
Doctor Watson tells me
that he's run off his feet

41
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,837
by this recent epidemic
of this Scarlet Fever.

42
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,131
And then of course, there's
Abergavenny murder coming up for trial.

43
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,217
Now, only a very important issue
could call us away at the present.

44
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,512
Important, sir?
Important?

45
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,516
I dare say you've heard of
the Duke of Holdernesse?

46
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,728
The former cabinet minister?

47
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,022
More than that, Watson.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,526
The letters after his name, huh,
almost half the alphabet.

49
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,781
One of the greatest subjects of
the crown, hey Doctor Huxtable?

50
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,118
One of the greatest and probably
one of the wealthiest,

51
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,205
He is also, l'm proud
to say, in my neighbor.

52
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,459
Holdernesse Hall, his countryseat,

53
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,544
is across from the valley
from the Priory School.

54
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,423
Duke is an intensely
solitary man.

55
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,135
He appalls the prospect
of public scrutiny

56
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,555
but such is his
anxiety in this matter

57
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,891
that his grace is prepared
to write a check for

58
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,935
five thousand pounds
to see the business off

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,441
and another thousand pounds to see
justice visited upon the villains.

60
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,404
That is how important it is.

61
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,913
A princely offer,
Doctor Huxtable.

62
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,875
You have failed in
describing villainy.

63
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,087
Forgive me.

64
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,133
Lord Saltire, the Duke's
son, his only child,

65
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,344
has been abducted.

66
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,307
From the Priory School?

67
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,225
Yes.

68
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,894
When he was in your care?

69
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,105
Quite,

70
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,943
And this abduction
happened three days ago?

71
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,403
Last Saturday night.

72
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,947
Why have you waited so
long before consulting me?

73
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,949
His Grace has a deep horror

74
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,993
of his family unhappiness
being dragged before the world.

75
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,788
The police have been requested
by the Duke to proceed

76
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,165
with such caution that they...

77
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:57,999
I see.

78
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,005
This affair has been
deplorably handled.

79
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,717
I feel it and admit it.

80
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,970
What form of the
demand for ransom take?

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,430
There has been none.

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,348
No demand for ransom?

83
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,015
None.

84
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,811
lt is one of the most
perplexing aspects of the business

85
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,981
for the boy was not
alone in his flight.

86
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,445
Herr Heidegger, the German master,
is also missing

87
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,573
as indeed, by the
way, is his bicycle.

88
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,327
lf he has abducted the boy why has
no demand for money been received?

89
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,290
Heidegger came to me from Switzerland
with the very best references.

90
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,417
Was any other
bicycle missing?

91
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,919
Oh no.

92
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:43,962
You're certain?

93
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,548
Quite Mr. Aveling
checked all the bicycles.

94
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,675
Doctor Huxtable do you
really mean to suggest

95
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,179
that this German master
rode off upon his bicycle

96
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,806
in the dead of night
bearing the boy in his arms?

97
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,057
No.

98
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,852
Then what is this
theory in your mind?

99
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,521
The bicycle may
have been a blind.

100
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,484
He may have hidden it somewhere,
and the pair gone off on foot.

101
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,861
Surely he would have hidden
a couple of bicycles

102
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,738
if he desired to
give that impression.

103
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,948
Yes l suppose he would.

104
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,201
Of course he would
Doctor Huxtable,

105
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,245
this blind theory of
yours will not do.

106
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,881
It is an admirable starting point
for an investigation.

107
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,303
Watson, would you send for
the cab immediately?

108
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,013
Now Holmes?

109
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,056
Set,

110
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,725
and pack.

111
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,395
We got just enough time
to catch the overnight train.

112
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,024
Doctor Huxtable I shall do
a little work at your doors.

113
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,776
Perhaps the train
is not so cold

114
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,238
but the two old hounds like Watson
and myself make get a sniff on it.

115
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,408
I imagine the arrival of Lord Saltire
at your school must have been

116
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,993
quite a feather in your cap.

117
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,037
My proudest
moment, Mr. Holmes.

118
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,832
Ever since Blackwell's published
Huxtable's Sidelights on Horace,

119
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,794
a notable little success in his day.
You may have heard of it.

120
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,837
No. How old is the boy?

121
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,130
Nine.

122
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,924
And he's been
with you how long?

123
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,301
Oh since the beginning
of the winter term.

124
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:18,640
An unusual boy, he seemed
to be fitting in well. He um...

125
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,143
Yes?

126
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,399
l was about to say he was
not entirely happy at home.

127
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,443
The Duke's marriage has
not been a peaceful one.

128
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,947
lt ended in separation
by mutual consent last year.

129
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,701
The Duchess has returned
to her father's palazzo in Venice.

130
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,288
This picture, of
the Duke's marriage,

131
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,457
how did you come by it?
Is it common knowledge?

132
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,044
I've had some confidential
talks with Mr. Wilder,

133
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,547
the Duke's secretary.
He's been most helpful.

134
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,675
And I suppose it
has been established

135
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,803
that the boy has not returned
to his mother in Italy?

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,263
Oh yes. Yes it has.

137
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,058
I cannot tell you, Mr. Holmes,
what a relief it is to me...

138
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:02,934
Watson?

139
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,020
Your picnic, sir.

140
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,896
Mrs. Hudson,

141
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,565
How did you guess?

142
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,026
Experience, Mr. Holmes.

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,485
Well that means the two doctors can

144
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,155
picnic away to their hearts content
on the train.

145
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,284
Even I may find my appetite is
keener for a few days

146
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,245
in the bracing atmosphere
of the peat country.

147
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,504
l think l will do myself no injustice
when l say that

148
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,050
the Priory School is the most
select preparatory school in England.

149
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,885
Lord Leverstoke,

150
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,181
the Earl of Blackwater,
Sir Cathcart Soames,

151
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,225
they all have entrusted
their sons to me.

152
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,855
You can't see Holdernesse
Hall from here

153
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,733
but there's a very fine view
from the chapel tower.

154
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,447
l will begin with the boy's room.

155
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,227
From his father?

156
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,979
lt arrived on the morning
of his disappearance.

157
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,402
Had he received one from Italy?

158
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,444
Not recently.

159
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,196
Where is the letter now?

160
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,407
lt cannot be found.

161
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,660
lt must have been on the boy's
person when he was abducted.

162
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,205
Who sleeps in the adjoining room?

163
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,711
lt's all right, just keep it in.

164
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,921
l know this sort of chap l dare say.

165
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,424
He could sleep through
a thunderstorm.

166
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,427
I don't think he would sir.

167
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,804
Really, And why is
that do you suppose?

168
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,974
There's a mouse sir,
ln the wainscot, sir.

169
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,853
And it wakes us both up sir,
Sometimes sir.

170
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,732
Mouse? So any noise from
Lord Saltire's room...

171
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,651
Well the door creaks sir.
You always hear the door.

172
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:21,197
On the night of the disappearance,
did you hear anything then?

173
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,118
No sir. You couldn't even
hear the crying.

174
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,706
Crying?

175
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:35,128
Yes sir. He sometimes cries sir.
Sometimes sir.

176
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,844
Thank you boys.

177
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,200
You have found nothing
in the grounds?

178
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,666
There's no knowing what l have found.
The trail is cold.

179
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,084
Headmaster!

180
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,632
Headmaster! The Duke of Holdernesse
is here headmaster.

181
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,925
Thank you, Mr. Aveling.

182
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,014
Mr. Holmes?

183
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,016
Yes.

184
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,519
The Duke is waiting, Mr. Holmes.

185
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,397
That will never do.

186
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,711
Your Grace. Mr. Wilder.

187
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,588
I called yesterday,
Doctor Huxtable,

188
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,465
but I was too late to prevent
your starting for London.

189
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,596
His Grace is surprised, Doctor Huxtable,
that you should of invited Mr. Holmes

190
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,224
to undertake an investigation
without consulting him first.

191
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,934
Well I thought that
the police had failed.

192
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,478
lt is by no means certain
that the police have failed.

193
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,688
Yes, but surely,
Mr. Wilder...

194
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,523
You're well aware,
Doctor Huxtable,

195
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,484
how anxious his Grace is
to avoid all public scandal.

196
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,614
He prefers to take as few people
as possible into his confidence.

197
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,117
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilder.
The matter is easily remedied.

198
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,912
Mr. Sherlock Holmes can return to London
by the morning train.

199
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,332
Hardly that Hardly that

200
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,169
l enjoy your invigorating
northern air.

201
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,298
l shall spend, at any rate,
a few days upon your moors.

202
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,177
Who knows I may at least find
Herr Heidegger's bicycle if nothing else.

203
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,138
This is not a trivial
matter, Mr. Holmes.

204
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,020
I am gratified that you
think not, your Grace.

205
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,858
lf there was meaning in
that remark, Mr. Holmes,

206
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,319
I'm afraid it escaped me.

207
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,199
Your only child has disappeared.
Your hopes, your future,

208
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,827
your noble family itself
is threatened with disillusion.

209
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,829
Your point, sir?

210
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,373
l ask your Grace,

211
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,379
what is modesty to this
to your child's life?

212
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,216
Or his reputation?

213
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,848
Not then it might be replied
what is continuance

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,352
without honor?

215
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,190
However, l believe you are largely
in the right, Mr. Holmes.

216
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,529
lf you refer to the constraints l have
placed upon the activities of the police

217
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,740
then perhaps l have
imposed too much.

218
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,996
I have a morbid fear
of the public gaze.

219
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,252
lt would be foolish not to avail ourselves
of Mr. Holmes services, James,

220
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,545
now that he is here.

221
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,922
Mr. Holmes?

222
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,341
Your Grace?

223
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,678
Perhaps you would like to come
and stay with us at Holdernesse Hall.

224
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,182
I thank your Grace but I think
for the purposes of my investigation

225
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,895
it would be wiser for me to remain here
at the scene of the mystery.

226
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,064
As you wish

227
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,318
Mr. Wilder or myself will be available
to provide you with

228
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,571
any assistance that
you might require.

229
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,991
Might l ask whether you have
formed any explanation

230
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,910
as to the mysterious disappearance
of your son?

231
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,333
No sir, l have not.

232
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,513
He is a fine boy, Mr. Holmes.

233
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,183
And how long has he
been in your class?

234
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,601
Since his arrival here.

235
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,978
Did he speak much of his family?

236
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,021
Not much.

237
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,610
lt's my belief that he missed his mother
this is something of his father's doing.

238
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,613
The separation between the Duke
and the Duchess, did he talk about that?

239
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,782
Not really.
It's a little mysterious.

240
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,825
The boy insisted that they loved
each other very much.

241
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,828
You don't think that he'd be whistling
in the wind to cheer himself up?

242
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,997
No he is a very realistic child.

243
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,208
Awe, but not a very
realistic family.

244
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,544
l was told that they were once
members of the Hellfire Club.

245
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,380
You wouldn't know, I suppose,

246
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,509
what time Herr Heidegger retired to his
room on the night of the disappearance?

247
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,136
Not really but quite late.

248
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,597
After eleven. He was duty
round master that night.

249
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,475
And a cyclists I believe?

250
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,894
Yes, oh yes.

251
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,313
Did Lord Saltire
ever accompany him.

252
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,691
No he is not yet able
to retain his balance.

253
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,695
You wouldn't, l suppose,

254
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,491
happen to know the make of tires
on Herr Heidegger's bicycle?

255
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,954
Certainly. A lovely bicycle
by the way made in Bramen.

256
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,997
The tires were Palmer,

257
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,833
you know the ones with
longitudinal tread.

258
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,170
l know the ones. Thank you.
Doubly helpful.

259
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,463
Pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

260
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,137
Dinner will be at eight.

261
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,859
I beg your pardon.

262
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,072
Holmes?

263
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,872
This case grows upon me, Watson.

264
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,375
There are decidedly points of interest
in connection with it.

265
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,668
Here look at this map.

266
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,338
There are certain geographical features,

267
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,883
which may have a good deal
to do with our investigation.

268
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,887
This dark square is
the Priory School.

269
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,516
This, the main road with no side
turning for a mile either way.

270
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,061
To the north of the school
the land rises slowly.

271
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,732
To the south, a large district
of arable land with

272
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,402
high walls and hedgerows,
impossible territory for a bicycle.

273
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,863
Oh what did you
discover at Oakborn?

274
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,741
Well the police had reports
from all over the place

275
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,244
on a man and a boy
seen together.

276
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,331
They completed their investigation
on the site early this morning.

277
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:08,956
What result?

278
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,624
Useless.

279
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,252
None bore the slightest resemblance
of the boy or the German master.

280
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,754
Excellent.

281
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,634
This mass of mistaken sightings, Watson,
it confirms my suspicion.

282
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,970
I don't believe they used the road.

283
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,392
That path of curiosity of quiet places
will surely find the light.

284
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,561
I don't think
they used the road at all.

285
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,939
But the bicycle?

286
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,107
A good cyclist does not
need a road, Watson.

287
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,446
The moor is intersected with paths.
l remember the moons that were full.

288
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,492
Now it is to the north
that our quest must lie.

289
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,118
You have done well, Watson.

290
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,246
Dinner's soon, you'll
be happy to hear

291
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,124
but I have do just have one point
on which I need to be satisfied.

292
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,128
Herr Heidegger's room.
Ten minutes.

293
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,969
Doctor Holmes is being delving into
the origins of the Holdernesse family.

294
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,931
Like many ancient lines
it sprang from a very muddy source.

295
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,140
Muddy Doctor?

296
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,353
Well not to be too delicate about it,
they were cattle thieves.

297
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,734
A worrier class, ingenious,
daring but the basis of their wealth

298
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,529
was running off with
other people's cows.

299
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,868
Holmes even tells me that
Holdenesse has furnished

300
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,788
one of the madder members
of the Hell Fire Club.

301
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,340
What is the matter
Doctor Huxtable?

302
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,260
It is nothing.

303
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,178
But it's clearly something.

304
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,560
I expect too much I'm sure.
It is a part-time job.

305
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,687
Tell us your expectations?

306
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,149
I do not expect miracles.

307
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,694
l think l am not a man
who demands the miraculous...

308
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,363
but you have discovered nothing.

309
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,869
We haven't found not a jot
since the moment we left London.

310
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,204
Although indeed that is not true.

311
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,291
You have discovered two
things, both falshoods.

312
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,127
One, a squalid piece of gossip

313
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,381
and the other an apocryphal and
insulting fancy

314
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,342
about the origins of my great patron.

315
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,554
I did not employ you to come here

316
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,223
to blacken the name of
the Holdernesses, Mr. Holmes.

317
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,852
Calm yourself, Doctor Huxtable.

318
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,774
We have in fact,
found some way.

319
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,779
I can describe to you in some detail
what took place in this school

320
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,238
on that fateful night.

321
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:52,286
Also the behavior of your excellent
and faithful German master.

322
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,749
Faithful, Heidegger?
What sir?

323
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,298
Herr Heidegger retired to his room
soon after eleven o'clock.

324
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,592
He was the duty
master that night.

325
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,262
Now my friend and colleague,
Doctor Watson, will impersonate.

326
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,646
Heidegger has still two hours work
ahead of him and it's been a long day.

327
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,441
He allows himself the comfort
of removing his jacket.

328
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,445
He moves across to
the chest by the door

329
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,907
and pours himself
a glass of sherry.

330
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,914
Badly needed fortification
of the task that lies ahead.

331
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,342
He collects the candle
and moves to his desk

332
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,804
to correct twenty-two
exercise books,

333
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,394
which contain not only Grammatik exercises
but also a lengthy composition.

334
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,566
You see my point,
Doctor Huxtable,

335
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,944
it would have been well after midnight
if he had done nothing else,

336
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,030
when his candle fails him.

337
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,661
The candles are kept in
the chest by the door.

338
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,541
He arises from the desk to fetch another
one but he cannot see to find them,

339
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,172
so he turns to the windows to draw the
curtains to see better by the moonlight.

340
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,344
Across the rooftops
on the gate tower

341
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,347
the boy has been
waiting for darkness,

342
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,392
knowing that his flight
must not be observed.

343
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:45,107
Herr Heidegger watches
as the boy hurries across the ledge

344
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,985
to keep his prearranged
meeting by the river.

345
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,034
Sensing the enormity of
what was taking place,

346
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,786
Heidegger runs to the door,

347
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,043
knocking over what remains
of his glass sherry as he goes.

348
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,547
I see.

349
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,050
Thank you.

350
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,178
lt seems l misjudged you.

351
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,598
The wisdom of his choice to
pursue the boy is questionable.

352
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,059
l believe his fate may be sealed.

353
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,064
You'll allow me, Mr. Holmes?
Do you mean...

354
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,400
I hope not but if my reasoning
is correct then I do fear for him.

355
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,695
And the boy?

356
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,077
The key to that, Doctor
Huxtable, remains out there.

357
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,706
Beyond the Drover's Bridge.

358
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,769
Poor beast.

359
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,024
Carrying crows.

360
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,151
They ruin their name.

361
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,408
So were assuming the boy was taken
away on horseback are we not?

362
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,284
Certainly.

363
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,745
Otherwise Heidegger would not have
needed a bicycle to pursue them.

364
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,582
But the only tracks we've
found are cattle, Holmes.

365
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,879
Holmes?

366
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,966
A track, Watson!

367
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,801
A track.

368
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,350
A bicycle?

369
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,313
Certainly a bicycle
but not the bicycle.

370
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,816
l'm familiar with forty-two
different impressions left by tires.

371
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:56,655
This is a Dunlop with a patch
upon the outer cover.

372
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,950
Heidegger's tires were Palmers.

373
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,329
This is not Heidegger's track.

374
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,081
Who's then?

375
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,166
Who's indeed?

376
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:11,879
Watson!

377
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,216
These are Palmer tracks
Heidegger has been this way.

378
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,891
Absolutely extraordinary.

379
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,982
Dunlop tracks for a hundred
fifty yards, they vanish

380
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,112
and Palmer tracks quite clear
leading to these rocks,

381
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,697
they vanish too.

382
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,410
Not a sign of a horse anywhere.

383
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:47,289
Watson, you have a blazing talent
for observing the obvious.

384
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,420
I should have brought
some luncheon.

385
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,343
Anyway what was Herr Heidegger
cycling after, cows?

386
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,223
Presumably they didn't abduct
the child on the back of a cow.

387
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,773
All traces of horses obliterated.

388
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,486
ln much evidence the two bicycles
have vanished into thin air.

389
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,570
lmpossible.

390
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,822
Precisely.

391
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,740
lt is impossible as
we have mistaken it,

392
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,119
therefore, in some respect,
we must have mistaken it wrong.

393
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,669
There's a hostelry mark
on the further edge of the moor.

394
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,462
Holmes,

395
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,007
there's a hostelry on
the Chesterfield Road.

396
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,307
Yes if he we keep on this line
we should come up to it,

397
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,774
Well that's where I'm going to
try my luck. I'm hungry.

398
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,324
Holmes?

399
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:10,622
Lunch, of course my dear fellow
you must be starving.

400
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,541
Now observe that map.

401
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:17,171
You will see that there's a hostelry
about three miles in this direction.

402
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,634
We'll need some food if we're going to
face the Duke of Holdernesse later.

403
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,780
Nothing?

404
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,159
Nothing. I must tell his Grace.

405
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,589
Nothing?

406
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,052
Nothing. I'm sorry.

407
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,194
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,552
lt's locked.

409
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:54,726
Primitive but forceful
as sporting portraits go.

410
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,195
Mr. Reuben Hayes?

411
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,239
How do you know my name?

412
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,074
lt's printed over the door.

413
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,286
We were looking for
some refreshment.

414
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:13,871
Were ya?

415
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,498
And would be obliged if
you could furnish it.

416
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:17,916
Would ya?

417
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,252
We would.

418
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,880
You must ask the woman.

419
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,847
Insufferable lout.

420
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,060
If were going all the way to
Holdernesse Hall this afternoon,

421
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,857
let us try to hire those unpreconditioned
beasts. What do you say?

422
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,289
How far are you taking them?

423
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:01,126
Just to the Hall and back,
You know the way, l dare say?

424
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,712
I worked there for fifteen years.

425
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,470
Yeah, you can take them.

426
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,890
My word, Mr. Hayes, you
have injured yourself.

427
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,270
lt's nothing.

428
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,358
I am a Doctor sir, and assure you it is.
You should have it attended.

429
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,777
How did you come by it?

430
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,654
One of my dogs did it.

431
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,283
Those scratches.

432
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,535
What about them?

433
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,331
Well at a gentler glance
they were that far apart.

434
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,210
What animal would
make such a scratch?

435
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,755
Probably a descendent
of the champion jack.

436
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,426
Cockfighting is forbidden by law
and has been for fifty years.

437
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,597
Many things are forbidden by law.
What law is there in such places as these?

438
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:01,603
Excellent, Mrs. Hayes, thank you.
What have you cooked?

439
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,608
Blood pudding, sweets
and...

440
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,074
How is it, Watson?

441
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,536
lt is disgusting, Holmes.

442
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,914
That woman,

443
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,044
she's frightened of something and
more than that husband of hers.

444
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,298
Deception upon deception.

445
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,385
What was it intended to hide?

446
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,763
Deception?

447
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,495
Oh, Watson, my horse is lame.

448
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,047
That's odd.

449
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,767
Old shoes, new nails.

450
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,677
Gentlemen.
His Grace will see you now.

451
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,068
Awe, Mr. Wilder.

452
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,988
Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson,
welcome to Holdernesse Hall.

453
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,282
His Grace will be
joining us shortly.

454
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,329
We are placing high hopes on your
skills Mr. Holmes. Did you bring news?

455
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,165
There is just one point
in which I need to be satisfied.

456
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,625
Yes Mr. Holmes?

457
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,170
lt concerns the Duke's
private concerns.

458
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,384
As his Grace's private secretary
perhaps l can be of some assistance.

459
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,178
l believe his Grace
wrote to his son

460
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,347
upon the day this
incident occurred.

461
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,474
No I believe he wrote
on the day before.

462
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,102
Yes but he would have
received it upon that day.

463
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,520
Yes, quite probably.

464
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,106
Might there have been
anything in that letter

465
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,567
which would have prompted
the boy to run away?

466
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,193
Oh, I hardly think so.

467
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,446
Anyway he would have
run here if anywhere.

468
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,032
Or to his mother in ltaly?

469
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,200
No sir.

470
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,871
Lord Saltire would

471
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,708
realize the impossibility
of achieving such a goal.

472
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,754
Even if abetted by this German,

473
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,551
he is an intelligent
and practical child.

474
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,261
And yet he cries in his sleep.

475
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,391
Did his Grace post
the letter himself?

476
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,394
His Grace is not in the
habit of posting letters.

477
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,439
The letter was laid with
others upon the study table

478
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,608
and I, myself,
put them there.

479
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,862
The only other person who would
handle them would be Rivers

480
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,323
who delivers the Daily
Post to the lodge.

481
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,200
And you're sure this
letter was among them?

482
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,285
Oh yes. I observed it,

483
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,705
And what have you
observed, Mr. Holmes?

484
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,250
How does your
investigation progress?

485
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,753
Are you to disappoint me?

486
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,425
I hope still to render your greater
happier and myself a richer man.

487
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,885
And what have you discovered?

488
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,597
lt is mostly a matter
of clarification.

489
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,018
My belief is that the boy was tempted
out of the school by a prearrangement

490
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,648
and l suspect that his mother
may have been the bait.

491
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,112
The German master observed his
departure and set off in pursuit.

492
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:28,286
We tracked the passage of his bicycle
across the moors with much difficulty.

493
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,709
It is almost as if the tracks were
deliberately sponged by someone...

494
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,880
Mr. Holmes?

495
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,719
Someone driving cattle. You don't happen
to know if the cattle on the moor...

496
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,056
What about them?
l hope you have seen none.

497
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,644
We cannot winter cattle outside
in our upland climate.

498
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,315
They will not be out of the yard for,
oh at least another two weeks.

499
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,154
Then I've been as
blind as the beetle.

500
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,158
l thank you, Grace.

501
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,083
Old shoes and new nails!
Old shoes and new nails!

502
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,835
Holmes there's something
you should see!

503
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,171
It is a remarkable...

504
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,840
Do you see those horseshoes?

505
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,465
l saw them.

506
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,886
Whoever took Lord Holdernesse shoed
their horses with different horseshoes

507
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,513
to escape detection.

508
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,811
Reuben Hayes took advantage
of a piece of local history?

509
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,156
It's bad Watson, bad.

510
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,454
Those vultures of the
north mark the spot.

511
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,637
German master.

512
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,394
What's left of him?

513
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:36,998
Hello!

514
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,127
Hello, hello!

515
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:53,139
Skin and blood. Only a microscope
would tell if it's human.

516
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,059
A consistent no doubt to
the scratch on Hayes neck.

517
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,435
Cause of death?

518
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,855
Strangulation.
The larynx is quite crushed.

519
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,358
That shepherd can be our messenger
to the priory school

520
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,485
with the news of this tragedy.

521
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,364
We must proceed on foot,
Watson. l was warm!

522
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:14,536
at that lnn,
warm as the children say.

523
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,790
The trail grows colder every
step l take away from it.

524
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,048
How was l supposed to know
where to put the body...

525
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,977
It's all over now, Arthur.

526
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,905
Reuben Hayes.
Let's hope we're not too late.

527
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,870
A Dunlop with a patch
on the outer cover.

528
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,675
What happened here, Mrs. Hayes?

529
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,012
l'm satisfied that you have
no liking for this business

530
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,722
and that you acted
under coercion.

531
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,642
Someone came for the boy.

532
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,022
The Duke's secretary,
Mr. Wilder?

533
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,696
Which way did they go?

534
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,033
Across the moor?

535
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,537
Aboard the Chesterfield Road
where...

536
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,206
Excellent, Mrs. Hayes.

537
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,461
I must alert the Duke's
household, Watson.

538
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,839
You are now the boy's
guardian angel.

539
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,433
I fancy I see your Grace's
checkbook upon your desk.

540
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,437
l would be glad if you would make me
out a check for six thousand pounds.

541
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,606
Perhaps it would be best
if you were to cross it.

542
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,610
The Capital and counties Bank,
Oxford Street branch, are my agents.

543
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,029
l do not possess a
temperament, Mr. Holmes

544
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,615
that appreciates the kind
of acidulous pleasantry

545
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,158
that clearly amuses you.

546
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,745
l am sorry, but l do
not see how James,

547
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,832
Mr. Wilder could possibly
be implicated in this business

548
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,500
and you average not proof of it.

549
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,877
But I possess the proof
It is beyond debate.

550
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,424
The mud is scarcely dry on the
cloven horseshoes in your casements.

551
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,009
Why do you doubt my word?

552
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,636
You seem to suffer
from a blindness.

553
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,139
Your own interest, which
borders on madness.

554
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,349
Your Grace,

555
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,938
those portraits in the hall

556
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,316
of you and your
father as young men,

557
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,653
there your family
liniments are very clear,

558
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,574
How long has Mr. Wilder
been in your service?

559
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:44,537
What is your meaning?
How dare you sir!

560
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,790
You do not understand!
You are a barbarian!

561
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,753
You will never... please leave
me immediately. I won't...

562
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:53,838
l...

563
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,515
Then it is as l suspected.

564
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,358
Mr. James Wilder is your son.

565
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,206
When l was a very
young man, Mr. Holmes,

566
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,250
l loved

567
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:37,590
with such a love that comes
only once in a lifetime.

568
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,970
l offered the lady marriage

569
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:49,227
but she refused it on the grounds
that such a match might

570
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,522
mar my career.

571
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,320
Had she lived l would certainly
never had married anyone else

572
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,321
but...

573
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:08,037
she died and left with one child,

574
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:15,378
James, whom for her sake
l have tended and cared for.

575
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,550
I could not acknowledge
paternity to the world

576
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,846
but in all other ways
I have treated him like my son.

577
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,436
He has required,
but not warranted,

578
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,231
a father's forgiveness
many times

579
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:41,112
and I have forgiven.
I have forgiven.

580
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,784
I have forgiven much.

581
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,832
Awe your Grace you have done
all you can for Mr. Wilder.

582
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,295
You must realize that
he is lost to you.

583
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,340
He's conspired to
abduct Lord Saltire.

584
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,843
He's an accessory to a murder,
however unwittingly.

585
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,763
He must be found

586
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,975
before he's attempted to
a crime even more terrible.

587
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,771
He must be found

588
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:19,066
before you loose the son
that is left to you.

589
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:39,837
Rivers. You are to organize
a search of the moor.

590
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,548
West Woods in a line from
the temple to the pavilion.

591
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,594
You are to employ the entire
staff without exception.

592
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,558
You are looking for
my son, Lord Saltire.

593
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,021
lf you find Mr. Wilder,

594
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,650
please see that he is detained

595
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,361
and brought to me.

596
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,668
Wilder intercepted your letter
and substituted a note

597
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,921
which deceived your son into believing
that he was to see his mother.

598
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,424
The murderous Hayes was
his paid accomplice

599
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,969
but the police have been alerted.
Hayes will not escape...

600
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:28,719
Watson?

601
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,225
l tracked them over to the moor
but they disappeared.

602
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,560
I searched the area

603
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,729
but it's as if the earth
just swallowed them up.

604
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,983
With my research into
your family history

605
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:47,697
l've seemed to recall mention
of a huge limestone cavern

606
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,699
where the stolen
cattle were penned.

607
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,076
The cathedral.

608
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,747
Come on.

609
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:00,835
Come on!

610
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,399
Hand him over.

611
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,361
No! You shall not have him!

612
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,531
Father!

613
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,740
Come Father!

614
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:59,870
Father! Father!

615
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,707
James!

616
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,529
l was disposed to love Francesca

617
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,908
and not with a boy's passion
but with a man's love.

618
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:47,585
My marriage to her
founded on James jealousy.

619
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,554
As long as l could see, his mother's
face and manner in him,

620
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,016
James knew he could
keep me from the love

621
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,518
I owed my wife.

622
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,984
Even his cruelty to Arthur,

623
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,655
I could not send him
away even for that.

624
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,368
So I sent Arthur away instead.

625
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,873
What did he hope to achieve
by kidnapping his brother?

626
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:27,625
Money?

627
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:31,754
Legitimacy?

628
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,215
And power.

629
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,051
Power over me.

630
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,223
He delighted in
exercising power over me,

631
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:48,604
for me and you were to
have denied him power.

632
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,857
But you suspected that he
was behind the abduction?

633
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,152
In my darkest moments, yes.

634
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,949
Yet somehow l hoped to...

635
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,619
save him.

636
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,709
Well, a long penance
it had seemed.

637
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:19,510
I can only hope that
Francesca will forgive me.

638
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,860
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

639
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,280
Your Grace?

640
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,703
This is a king's ransom.

641
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,707
You have given me
back my future.
