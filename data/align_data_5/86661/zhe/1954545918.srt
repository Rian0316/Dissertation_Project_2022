00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,464

4
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:45,488

三等车厢 到伦敦桥
Third-class London Bridge.

7
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:12,534

Single or return?

8
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,907
噢 无所谓啦 单程

快点
Quickly,

10
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,267
快一点
quickly.

11
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,253
他死了
He's dead,

12
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:15,027
一定是从火车上掉下来了
must have fallen from the train.

13
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,569
是啊 看他的头
Yeah, look at his head.

14
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:18,722
你回去警局
You run back to the station

15
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,784
报告这里的情况
and tell'em what happened,

16
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,645
我守在这里
I'll stay here.

17
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:39,315

18
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,711
好一场浓雾啊
It's a real pea souper

19
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,945

Nothing in the paper, Watson?

20
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,225
没有

21
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:50,069
南非又一场革命爆发
There's another revolution in South America,

22

也许非洲要开战了
possible war in Africa,

23
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,304
没有你感兴趣的
nothing of interest to you.

24
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,189
伦敦的罪犯们真是没用
The London Criminal is certainly a dull fellow.

25
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,900
这样的天气里 盗贼和杀人犯 可以在伦敦街头闲庭信步
A thief or a murderer could roam London on a day like this

26
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,379
就像丛林里的老虎
as the tiger does the jungle,

27
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,390
当发起突袭的那一刻
unseen until he pounces,

28
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:11,092
受害者才会发觉
and then evident only to his victim.

29
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,840
有很多小毛贼啊
There are numerous petty thefts.

30
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,484
那种阴森的大舞台
Well, this great and somber stage

31
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,329
是为更带劲的情况准备的
is set for something more worthy than that.

32
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:22,884
我不是罪犯
It is fortunate for the community

33
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,513
真是国家的大幸啊
that I am not a criminal.

34
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,609
那倒没错
It is indeed.

35
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,195
那些暗杀横行拉丁国家 没有这样的浓雾天
It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin countries,

36
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:31,227
真是走运
the countries of assassination.

37
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:32,656

41
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,782
什么事
Well, well, what next?

42
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,435
我哥哥Mycroft要来了
My brother Mycroft is coming around.

43
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,405
噢 有什么奇怪的
Oh, why not.

44
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,316
有什么奇怪的
Why not?

45
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,085
就像见到一辆电车
As if you met a tram-car

46
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,750
行驶在乡间小路
coming down a country lane.

47
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,854
Mycroft有他自己的轨道
Mycroft has his lines and he runs on them.

48
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,454
他出入繁华地段的住所
Now, his Pall Mall Lodgings,

49
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,077
穿梭于Diogenes俱乐部 白厅...
the Diogenes Club, Whitehall...

50
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:56,735
那是他的圈子
that's his cycle.

51
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,487
他只来过这里一次
Once and only once has he ever been here.

52
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:01,562
我是说 什么样的事会惊动他呢
I mean what upheaval can possibly have derailed him?

53
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,229
"为Cadogan West一事 必须见你"
Must see you over Cadogan West.

54
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,518
"即刻到"
Coming at once.

55
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:09,124
"Mycroft"
Mycroft.

56
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:10,404
我听过这个名字
I've heard the name.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,388
我可什么都没想起来
That recalls nothing to my mind.

58
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,010
Mycroft打破他古怪的作风
Mycroft breaking out of this erratic fashion,

59
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,521
太反常了
It's extraordinary.

60
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:20,141
华生 你知道Mycroft是干什么的吧
Watson, you do know what Mycroft is.

61
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:21,981
我只记得那一次
I seem to remember about the time,

62
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,513
那个希腊翻译员的案子
of the affair of the Greek interpreter.

63
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,459
你告诉我 他在英国政府里的
You told me that he had some small office

64
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,061
某个小办公室就职
under the British government.

65
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,313
那阵子他不太顺
He wasn't doing quite so well in those days.

66
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,643
他的位置是独一无二的

67
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,893

前无古人
There's never been anything like it before

69
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,605
后无来者
nor will be again.

70
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,278
他的头脑清晰 条理缜密
He is the tidiest and most orderly brain

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,097
记忆力惊人
with the greatest capacity for storing facts

72
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:43,500
无人能及
of any man living.

73
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,904
政府的每一个结论
The conclusions of every government department

74
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:46,674
都要经他的手

75

他是中心交换站

76
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,905
一切都由他来平衡
which makes out the balance.

77

其它人是专家
All other men are specialists.

78
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:58,199
而他的专长是无所不知
His specialism is omniscience.

79
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,631
一次又一次
Time and time again

80
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:03,936
Mycroft的一句话决定了国家的政策

81
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,816
多么神奇的人物啊
Then Jupiter himself.

00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:07,479
而他今天居然会来拜访我们

83
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,802

Yes, indeed.

84

死在地铁里
on Tuesday morning.

90
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,281
噢 是啊 是啊
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

91
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,017
这种平淡无奇的案子
It was a featureless case as I remember,

92
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,865
年轻人从火车上掉下来
young man killed falling from a moving train,

93
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,955
没有抢夺和暴力的痕迹

00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,387
啊 找到了

00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,823
Cadogan West
Cadogan West,

109
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,906
最棘手的问题 夏洛克
the most annoying business, Sherlock.

110
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:16,042
我非常不喜欢改变我的习惯
I extremely dislike altering my habits

111
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:19,858
可当局让我无可辩驳
with the powers that be would broke no denial.

112
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,667
目前暹罗的情况之下
In the present state of Siam

113
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,897
我离开办公室真是雪上加霜
it's most awkward I should be away from the office

114
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,885
但这是真正的危机 夏洛克
but it is a real crisis Sherlock.

115
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,254
我从没见过首相这样不安
I've never seen the Prime Minister so upset

116
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,901
整个海军部
and as to the Admiralty,

117
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:36,752
好像个炸了的蜜蜂窝
buzzing like an overturned beehive.

118
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,680
请坐吧 Bradstreet
Do sit down Bradstreet.

119
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,356
这些报纸上
Well, there's nothing unusual

120
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,956
没写什么特别的
reported in the newspapers.

121
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,180
我希望没写
I should hope not.

122
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,597
那个可怜的年轻人
The wretched youth,

123
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:55,381
他衣服口袋里 装着布鲁斯-帕廷顿潜水艇计划

124
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,251
你们一定听说过
Well, you must have heard of it.

125
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,603
只听过名字
Only by name.

126
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:04,638
它的重要性怎么说都不过分
Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.

127
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,305
这是政府
It has been the most closely guarded

128
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,330
最严格保密的秘密
of all government secrets.

129
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,619
我可以告诉你们
You may take it from me that navel warfare

130
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,515
在布鲁斯-帕廷顿的效力范围以内
becomes impossible within the radius

131
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:19,337
海战就不会发生
of a Bruce Partington operation.

132
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,943
那么 我们在讨论的
So, what sort of plans

133
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,851
是计划的哪一部分?
are we talking about?

134
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:25,212
最难以理解的部分 夏洛克
Extremely intricate ones, Sherlock.

135
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,471
30页纸
Some 30 different pages,

136
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,493
每一页对整体都至关重要
each one essential to the working of the whole.

137
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,710
这些计划通常放在哪里?
Where are the plans normally kept?

138
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,178
在一个紧挨着Woolwich军工厂的
In an elaborate safe

139
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,637
机密办公室
in a confidential office

140
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,478
放在精密保险箱里
adjoining the arsenal of Woolwich

141
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:40,334
办公室还装有防盗门窗
with burglar proof doors and windows.

142
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,912
即使是海军将军
If the chief instructor of the Navy himself

143
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,477
想参阅这些计划
desired to consult the plans,

144
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:47,843
他一定得到Woolwich去
he would have to go to Woolwich to do so.

145
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,994
从一个死去的小职员口袋里
To think they should turn up in the pocket

146
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,149
翻出伦敦最重要的东西
of a dead Junior Clerk

147
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,889
想一想就觉得可怕
in the heart of London is simply awful.

148
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,841
你们找回那些计划书了吗?
Have you recovered the papers?

149
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,445
没有 夏洛克 没有
No, Sherlock, no.

150
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,617
这就是棘手的地方
That's the pinch.

151
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,463
没有找到
We have not.

152
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,905
有10页计划书被从Woolwich拿走了
Some ten papers were taken from Woolwich.

153
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,375
可是只在Cadogan West的口袋里
Only seven were found

154
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:08,036
找到了7页
in the pocket of Cadogan West.

155
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,361
另外的3页
The other three are

156
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,009
没了 不见了
missing, gone, vanished, stolen.

157
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,024
你必须放下所有的事情 夏洛克
You must drop everything, Sherlock.

158
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:18,966
别管你那些治安法庭负责的小破案子了
Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police courts.

159
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,875
这是真正的国际大案
This is a real international crisis

160
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:25,699
你一定得解决的大案
that you have to solve.

161
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,957
我想 这个案子
Well, there are some points of interest

162
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:32,066
确实有些地方很让我感兴趣
in the case I suppose.

163
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,525
我很乐意去调查
I'll be pleased to look into it.

164
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,471
啊
Ah.

165
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:39,669
Bradstreet 都有谁掌管保险柜的钥匙?
Bradstreet, now, who held the keys to that safe?

166
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,383
一共有两串钥匙
There are two sets of keys.

167
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,158
James Walter先生拿着一串
Sir James Walter holds one set.

168
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,736
他是管理秘密文件的官员
He is the actual official guardian of the papers.

169
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,210
一个鞠躬尽瘁的老官员
A man grown gray in the service of the State,

170
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,951
上流社会颇受人欢迎的客人
a favored guest in the most exalted houses.

171
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:55,496
他的爱国主义不容置疑 可以免除嫌疑
His patriotism is above suspicion.

172
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:56,811
另一串呢?
And the other keys?

173
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,512
Sidney Johnson先生
A Mr. Sidney Johnson,

174
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,085
高级职员 也是制图员
a Senior Clerk and Draughtsman.

175
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,615
一个沉默寡言的男人
A silent morose man,

176
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,239
不爱社交 但工作尽心尽力
not popular but a hard worker.

177
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:04,422
他有妻子作证
His wife corroborates

178
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,526
他是清白的
his account of the matter.

179
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,108
周一整个晚上他都在家里
He was at home the whole of Monday night

180
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:08,600
钥匙从没离开过表链
and the keys never left the watch-chain

181
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,582
一直好端端挂在那
upon which they hang.

182
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,145
那个叫West的是什么人?
What sort of fellow was this man West?

183
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,857
鲁莽的热血青年
Hot-headed, rather impetuous,

184
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,597
他的工作
his duties brought him

185
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,170
需要他每天和计划书打交道
into daily contact with the plans.

186
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,450
那天晚上是谁锁的保险柜?
Who locked them up that night?

187
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:21,880
Johnson 那个高级职员
Johnson, the Senior Clerk.

188
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,197
但是后来却出现在
But yet they were found on the person

189
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,028
一个初级职员的口袋里
of the Junior Clerk.

190
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:25,948
我是说结论不是很明显吗
Well, I mean that sounds final, does it not?

191
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,271
是啊 可是他为什么要拿走呢?
Yeah, but why would he take them?

192
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:30,017
他拿走计划 除了拿到伦敦去卖
Reason why he should take them

193
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:31,577
还能有别的原因吗?
up to London except to sell them.

194
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,324
没了
Nope.

195
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:36,636
那么这就是我们的破案前提
Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.

196
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:39,877
West 他有没有可能
West, could he have done this

197
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,418
制作了备用钥匙?
with false keys?

198
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,912
他打开保险柜 取走文件
He opens the safe, takes out the papers,

199
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:46,137
去伦敦见一个外国特务
goes off to London to see a foreign agent.

200
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,770
他必须在早上之前带回来
He has to have'em back before morning

201
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:50,518
否则就会被发现了
or the loss will be discovered.

202
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:51,665
他拿走了10页
He took away ten.

203
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,245
7页在口袋里
Seven were in his pocket.

204
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:56,047
剩下3页呢?
What became of the other three?

205
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,511
他本人当然不想
He certainly wouldn't leave

206
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:58,899
落下那3页文件
them of his own free will.

207
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,298
我都明白了
It all seems perfectly clear to me.

208
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,140
如你所说 福尔摩斯先生
As you say, Mr. Holmes,

209
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:06,476
West偷了计划书 打算卖掉
West stole the plans in order to sell them.

210
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:07,975
他去见了特务
He met the agent

211
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,786
但是价格上有了分歧
but they could not agree as to a price.

212
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,216
所以West转身回家
So West returned home again

213
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,913
而特务一直跟着他
but the agent followed him.

214
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:16,624
在火车上 干掉了他
In the train the agent murdered him,

215
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,849
带走了最精华的几页
took the more, essential papers,

216
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,472
并把尸体从火车上抛了下来
and threw the body from the railway carriage.

217
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,416
一切都解释得通了 对不对?
Now, that would explain everything, would it not?

218
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,399
很好
It's good,

219
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,380
非常好 Bradstreet
that's very good, Bradstreet.

220
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,220
你的理论很完整
Your theory holds together.

221
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:32,441
可如果这是真的 这个案子就了结了
But if this is true then the case is at an end.

222
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,800
一方面 叛国者已经伏法
On the one hand the traitor is dead,

223
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,049
另一方面
on the other

224
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,681
布鲁斯-帕廷顿潜水艇计划
the plans of the Bruce Partington submarine

225
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,254
现在大概已经到了某个大陆
are presumably somewhere on the continent.

226
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:39,678
我是说 我还能做什么呢?
I mean what is there for me to do?

227
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:41,967
行动吧 夏洛克
To act Sherlock,

228
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,677
行动
to act.

229
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:48,053
我的直觉不相信这种解释
All my instincts are against this explanation

230
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,109
我认为 你也一样
and yours too, I think.

231
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,395
手足之情不是空话
We are not brothers for nothing.

232
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,313
利用你的能力
Use your powers.

233
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:55,596
到现场去
Go to the scene.

234
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,987
提问相关的人员
Question the people concerned.

235
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,173
想方设法
Leave no stone unturned.

236
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:00,640
在你的侦探生涯中
In all of your career

237
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,205
再也找不到这样一个机会
you'll never have a greater chance

238
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,458
为你的国家效力呢
of serving your country.

239
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:06,090
如果你这边
If you on your part

240
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,079
可以给我一份完整的
will be kind enough to send me a complete list

241
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,061
已知在英国的
of foreign spies and international agents

242
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,592
国外间谍和国际特务的名单
known to be in England

243
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,571
和他们的地址
and their full address.

244
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,232
我们这边
And then we on our part

245
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:16,841
可以开始我们的调查了
can begin our investigation

246
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,494
先去一趟Longhead车站
by a visit to Longhead Station

247
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,547
Bradstreet
Bradstreet.

248
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,064
华生
Watson,

249
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,910
Hudson太太 我们要走了
Mrs. Hudson, we're leaving.

250
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,210
尸体是什么时间发现的?
When was the body found?

251
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,668
大概六点左右 先生
Near enough to six o'clock, sir,

252
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,056
周二早上
Tuesday morning.

253
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,411
他一定是周一晚上什么时间
He must have fallen from the train

254
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,589
从火车上掉下来的
some time Monday night.

255
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,198
车架上有没有发现
Have the carriages been examined

256
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,098
任何打斗的痕迹?
for any signs of violence?

257
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,220
没有争斗的痕迹
No such trace of violence had been found.

258
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:55,667
没有报告说车门是开着的?
No report of a door found open?

259
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,437
从他的车票上
We can tell the approximate time

260
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,802
我们可以估计出他上车的时间
that he entered the train from his ticket.

261
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,730
尸体上没发现车票
There was no ticket on the body.

262
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:06,237
那真是奇怪了
That is really very singular.

263
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,218
以我的经验
Then in my experience it's not possible

264
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,454
不出示车票
to reach the platform of the Metropolitan Line

265
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:13,120
是无法登上月台的 对不对?
without exhibiting one's ticket, is that not so?

266
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,693
是的 先生
Quite correct, sir.

267
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,290
不过 也许是凶手在把尸体抛出火车之前
Surely, the murderer would have removed the ticket

268
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,630
拿走了车票
before throwing West from the train

269
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,925
这样就无法发现
so as not to reveal the name of the station

270
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,576
离特务的住处最近的车站是哪里了
nearest his place of residents.

271
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,072
我想医生说得很对
I think the doctor has it.

272
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,609
他身上除了计划书和车票不见了之外
What else did he have in his possession

273
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,039
还发现了什么?
besides the fabled papers and no ticket?

274
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:30,502
只是些常用物品
Usual things,

275
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,205
笔记本 钱包 支票簿
pocketbook, notecase, checkbook.

276
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:36,829
噢 还有两张Woolwich剧院
Oh, and two tickets for the Dress Circle

277
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,180
前排座位的戏票
of the Woolwich Theater

278
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,543
时间是当晚
for that very evening.

279
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,564
看上去 West打算
It appears that West was to have attended

280
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:46,346
和他的未婚妻一起去看戏
the performance in the accompany of his fiance,

281
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,705
Violet Westbury小姐
Ms. Violet Westbury.

282
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,365
她是当晚最后一个见到他还活着的人
She was the last person to see him alive on that fatal night.

283
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:53,438
他们一起去剧院
They were walking to the theater together

284
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:56,919
走到公园的时候 他突然离开了她
in the park when he suddenly left her.

285
00:13:56,994 --> 00:14:00,075
-没有解释就走了? -没有
-Suddenly without explanation. -NO.

286
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,595
铁轨上没有任何血迹?
There appears to be no bleeding on the line?

287
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:06,012
嗯 那里没有发现任何血迹
Well, there was hardly any trace of blood to be found.

288
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:06,615
据我推测
As I gather

289
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,855
一个人从开动的火车上掉下来
there was a considerable wound

290
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,002
一定会有相当大的伤口
consistent with a man falling from a moving train.

291
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,602
那是相当可怕
Well, it was a terrible thing to see.

292
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,250
据报告是脑部遭到重击
Said the head was knocked right in

293
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:14,400
头骨破裂而死
and the bone crushed.

294
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,797
没有特别的外部伤痕
And yet, there was no great external injury.

295
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:20,353
我想应该会有血迹
Well, I would expect some blood.

296
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:25,696
火车是往东北边开的
So the line runs northeast.

297
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,544
是的 铁轨从这里分开 先生
Yes, the track divides here sir,

298
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,135
这里一条支线向南
and there's a branch line goes south under the river

299
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:32,387
开往Rotherhive和New Cross
to Rotherhive and New Cross.

300
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,033
交叉点
The point.

301
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,251
交叉点
The point

302
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:45,063
我想整个铁路系统上面
I suppose there are no great number

303
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,941
没有几个这样的交叉点吧?
of points in the system such as this?

304
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,170
很少 先生
There are very few, sir.

305
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:53,344
交叉点
Points,

306
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,428
弯曲
and a curve,

307
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,459
啊 如果真是这样的话
oh by Jove, If it were only so.

308
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,969
是什么
What is it?

309
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,595
福尔摩斯 你发现线索了?
Holmes, do you have a clue?

310
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,478
只是一个想法 Bradstreet
Well, it's an idea Bradstreet,

311
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,699
一个迹象而已
an indication no more.

312
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,808
不过这个案子突然有意思起来了
But the case certainly grows in interest

313
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,646
很奇特
It's unique,

314
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:17,391
非常奇特
Perfectly unique.

315
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,934
为什么不呢
And yet why not?

316
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:30,579
出租马车!
Cab!

317
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,213
这里有我们要的东西 华生
There is material here, Watson,

318
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,225
大有余地
there is scope.

319
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:37,245
我当初没发现这种可能 真是迟钝
I was dull indeed not to see it's possibilities.

320
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,690
我承认是挺迟钝
Well I confess it's dull to me.

321
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,217
我也是
And to me also,

322
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:41,913
但现在我有了一个想法
but I now have a hold of an idea

323
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,798
也许能带我们更进一步
which may lead us far.

324
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,259
现在轮到James先生了
Now I think, Sir James,

325
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,629
计划书的保管者
the guardian of the plans

326
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,942
是我们最先该注住的人
claims our first attention.

327
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,435
去Mumstead Hall
Mumstead Hall.

328
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,421
福尔摩斯?
Well, Holmes?

329
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:08,157
你的想法是?
Your idea?

330
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:09,410
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

331
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,338
那个West的死亡
The man West was killed

332
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,190
不是因为从车上掉下来
not by falling

333
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,326
也不是从火车上扔出来
or being thrown from a moving train.

334
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,062
他是在别的地方送命的
He met his death elsewhere

335
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,007
然后尸体被人放到了车顶上
and his body was on the roof of the carriage.

336
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,368
车顶上?
On the roof?

337
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,863
想想吧
Well, consider the facts.

338
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,525
发现尸体的地方
Is it a coincidence that the body was found

339
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,433
恰好在火车到达交叉点
in the very place

340
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,344
制动并转弯的地方
where the train brakes and sways

341
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,848
这难道是巧合吗?
as it comes round on the points?

342
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,558
突然的减速
The sudden slowing

343
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,769
不会影响车厢内的物体
would affect no object inside the carriage

344
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:41,333
但是车顶上的尸体则另当别论
but an object such as a body on the roof.

345
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,093
血迹也是问题
And there's the question of the blood.

346
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,729
当然了 如果尸体的血流在别处
Of course, there was no bleeding on the line

347
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,824
当然不会在铁轨上发现血迹了
if the body bled elsewhere.

348
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,863
每一个事实都佐证了这个说法
Each fact is suggestive in itself.

349
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,566
合起来就是一个结论
Together they have a cumulative force.

350
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,554
对了 还有车票
Yes, and the ticket too.

351
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,397
那也可以解释失踪的车票
That would explain the absence of the ticket.

352
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,280
华生 一切都符合了
Watson, it all fits together.

353
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,954
请等一下
Please wait.

354
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:20,899
先生们 请进
Come in please gentlemen.

355
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:23,013
我们在等你
We were expecting you.

356
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,406
啊 先生们
Ah, gentlemen.

357
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:43,541
Baines 谢谢
Thank you Baines.

358
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:44,684
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

359
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:48,798
请跟我来 遗体在楼上
If you follow me the body is upstairs.

360
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,001
等 等一下
But wait, one moment.

361
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,302
你们不是承办葬礼的人吗?
Are you not the undertakers?

362
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:58,177
不好意思 James先生
Excuse me, Sir James.

363
00:17:58,214 --> 00:17:59,887
呃 我是华生医生
Uh, I am Dr. Watson and, um,

364
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,912
这位是夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

365
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,340
我的主啊
Good heavens.

366
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,825
我们在帮助当局
We are helping the authorities

367
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,462
寻找失踪的文件
in the case of the missing papers.

368
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,501
我哥哥 James Walter爵士
My brother, Sir James Walter,

369
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,870
今天早晨去世了
died this morning.

370
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:15,901
我是Valentine Walter上校
I am Colonel Valentine Walter.

371
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:21,456
请这边来
Please gentlemen, come here.

372
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,297
我们非常遗憾 先生
We are very sorry, sir.

373
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,501
谢谢
Thank you.

374
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,984
我知道 这非常突然
I'm afraid it has been a great shock.

375
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:44,022
我可不可以问一下
May I ask

376
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,059
你哥哥是怎么去世的?
how did your brother die?

377
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,420
真是难以启齿
It was this horrible scandal.

378
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,481
我哥哥...
My brother is...

379
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,360
我哥哥是一个有着强烈荣誉感的人
my brother was a man of very sensitive honor.

380
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
他一直为自己主管的部门
He was fiercely proud

381
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,647
工作效率之高感到自豪
of the efficiency of his department.

382
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:02,371
计划书遭窃 对他是个致命的打击
The theft of the plans was a crushing blow.

383
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,076
他伤透了心
It broke his heart.

384
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:07,804
我们本希望James爵士
We were hoping Sir James

385
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,082
能帮助我们
might have been able to help.

386
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:09,845
我向你们保证
I assure you

387
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,246
他和我们一样
it was as much a mystery to him

388
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,513
对此大感不解
as it to all of us.

389
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,204
显然 他毫不怀疑West有罪
Naturally he had no doubt that West was guilty

390
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,342
但他为什么要这样做
but why he should have done such a thing.

391
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,689
现在 我们无从得知了
Now, of course, we shall never know.

392
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:27,884
那么 也许你可以指点一二?
So, you can turn a light on the matter?

393
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,050
我?
Me?

394
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,819
恐怕我除了道听途说之外
I'm afraid I know nothing

395
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:33,256
一无所知
say what I've read or heard.

396
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:36,311
-你从没见过Cadogan West? -没见过
-And you never meet Cadogan West? -No.

397
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:39,302
我很久没有回国了
No, I have not been back in the country long.

398
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,449
我哥哥为一个高度机密的机构工作
My brother's work was of a very highly-confidential nature.

399
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,118
他从不跟我透露
He did not discuss it with me.

400
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:49,137
先生们 我不想失礼
Gentlemen, I do not wish to discourteous

401
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:52,450
不过目前 我们非常狼狈
but we are much disturbed at present.

402
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,571
我冒昧恳请您结束这次谈话
I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.

403
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:58,855
好的 很抱歉我们给您添麻烦了
Yes, we're sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

404
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:14,819
真是意想不到的发展
That's an unexpected development.

405
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,238
心力衰竭
Heart failure.

406
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,080
或是自杀
Or suicide.

407
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:21,843
该轮到Westbury小姐了
Now for Miss. Westbury.

408
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,623
死者的未婚妻?
Is that the dead man's fiancee?

409
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,467
没错
Yes.

410
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,892
我没法解释 福尔摩斯先生
I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes.

411
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,660
自从悲剧发生我就没合过眼
I haven't closed my eyes since the tragedy

412
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:57,489
我不停地想啊想啊
thinking and thinking and thinking

413
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:01,045
事实会是什么样子
what the true meaning of it can be.

414
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,679
请坐
Do sit down.

415
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,646
Arthur是最诚实
Arthur was the most single-minded,

416
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:18,502
最有骑士风度 最爱国的人
chivalrous, patriotic man on earth.

417
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,897
他宁愿切掉自己的右手
He would have cut off his right-hand

418
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,522
也不会出卖
rather than sell a State secret

419
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,276
由他保管的国家机密
confided to his keeping.

420
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:29,414
对了解他的人来说 这是非常荒谬 绝对不可能的事情
It's absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.

421
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:31,937
事实上 Westbury小姐
The facts Ms. Westbury.

422
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,936
-他缺钱吗? -不
-Was he want of money? -No.

423
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,425
他的生活非常简单
His needs were very simple

424
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,152
他的薪水也很丰厚
and his salary was sufficient.

425
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,639
他已经攒了几百磅
He'd saved a few hundreds

426
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,020
我们打算新年的时候结婚
and we were to marry at the new year.

427
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:48,730
会不会受到什么精神上的刺激呢?
Was there any sign of mental excitement?

428
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,290
说吧 Westbury小姐
Come, Ms. Westbury,

429
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,159
对我们不妨直言
be absolutely frank with us.

430
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,979
我有一种感觉
I had a feeling

431
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:59,751
他是有些想法
there was something on his mind.

432
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:00,973
多久了?
How long?

433
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,109
大概是上周或者上上周开始
Only the last week or two.

434
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,878
有一次我问他
Once I asked him about it.

435
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:07,957
事情太严重 对你也不能说
It is too serious to speak about

436
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,160
他是这么回答的
even to you he said.

437
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,931
说下去 Westbury小姐
Go on, Ms. Westbury

438
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,443
即使也许会对他不利
even if it seems to turn against him.

439
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,517
我们也不知道接下来会怎样
We cannot say where it might lead us.

440
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:23,319
有天晚上他谈到...一个秘密
He spoke one evening about a,a secret.

441
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,604
我想他是说
I think he said that no doubt

442
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:29,067
外国间谍无疑会出大价钱
foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.

443
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:31,389
他说我们管理松散
He said that we were slack about such matters

444
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,819
如果有叛徒监守自盗
and it would be easy for a traitor

445
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:35,938
那是非常容易的事情
to get hold of the plans.

446
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:39,065
噢 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, Mr. Holmes,

447
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,136
如果您可以
if you could only,

448
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:44,291
可以挽回他的名誉
only save his honor.

449
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:46,851
那对他意义重大
It was so much to him.

450
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:51,377
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

451
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:55,410
请跟我讲讲最后那个晚上
Now, please tell us about that last evening.

452
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:00,149
那是周一的晚上
It was Monday night

453
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:04,939
我们本来要去剧场
and we were to go to the theater.

454
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,747
Violet
Violet,

455
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:19,583
我恐怕要离开一下
I'm afraid I've got to leave you.

456
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,752
离开?
Leave me?

457
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,964
事情非常 非常重要
It's very, very important.

458
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,199
对不起
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,800
你最好回家去
You better go home.

460
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,979
马上回家吧
Go home immediately, please.

461
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,560
就是这里 福尔摩斯先生
It was just here, Mr. Holmes.

462
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,651
他一言不发就离开了?
And he disappeared without any explanation?

463
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,051
是的
Yes.

464
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,981
你确定当时就是在这里?
You are sure this is the exact spot?

465
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:32,965
是的
Yes.

466
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:35,626
我们约会的时候
We often used to meet here

467
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,270
经常在这里见面
when we were courting.

468
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:40,282
你可以看到
You see that's the building

469
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,151
他工作的地方
where he used to work.

470
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,847
噢
Oh.

471
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:48,658
那是我最后一次见到他
That was the last time I saw him.

472
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,775
华生 麻烦你
Watson will you be so kind

473
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:53,255
叫一辆马车 送Westbury小姐回家
as to take Miss Westbury home in a cab.

474
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,900
太糟糕了 非常糟糕
It's bad, it's really bad

475
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:15,401
没错 Jones先生
Of course, Mr. Jones.

476
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:17,682
这里整个乱套了
The whole place is disorganized.

477
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,250
West死了
West dead,

478
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,495
主管死了
the Chief dead,

479
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,747
计划书不见了
our papers stolen.

480
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,587
可是
And yet,

481
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,099
周一晚上我锁门的时候
when I closed this office on Monday evening

482
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,362
我们还和所有政府的办公室一样有效率
we were as efficient as any in the service.

483
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,214
周一办公室下班是几点?
What hour was the office closed on Monday?

484
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,130
五点
At 5:00.

485
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,006
是你锁的门?
Did you close it?

486
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:35,811
我一直是最后一个离开的
I'm always the last man out.

487
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,454
那晚上楼里有人巡视吗?
Is there a night watchman to the building?

488
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,557
是的
There is.

489
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:42,234
他同时也负责另外几个部门
He has other departments to look after as well.

490
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,959
他是个老兵
He's an old soldier.

491
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,622
非常可靠
A most trustworthy man.

492
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:48,866
那天晚上他什么都没看见
He didn't see anything that evening.

493
00:25:48,904 --> 00:25:50,218
谢谢你
Thank you.

494
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:57,460
当你锁门的时候
When you closed the office

495
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,570
计划书在哪里?
where were the plans?

496
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,114
在保险柜里
In that safe.

497
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:01,938
我亲自放进去的
I put them there myself.

498
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:13,087
如果Cadogan West 要在下班后进入办公室
If Cadogan West was to enter the office after hours,

499
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,710
取走计划书
he would need three keys, would he not,

500
00:26:15,747 --> 00:26:17,069
他必须有三把钥匙 对不对
before he could reach these papers.

501
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:19,367
是的 一把大门钥匙
Yes, a key to the outer door,

502
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:20,711
一把办公室门钥匙
a key to the office,

503
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:22,471
一把保险柜钥匙
and a key of the safe.

504
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:25,076
只有你和James Walter爵士
And only you and Sir James Walter

505
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:26,144
有这几把钥匙
had those keys.

506
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,770
是的
Yes, indeed.

507
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,395
James爵士把所有钥匙都串在一起
Sir James kept all three keys on one ring.

508
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:31,780
从不离身
They never left him.

509
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:34,372
当然了 你的钥匙也没离开过你
And, of course, your keys left your possession.

510
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,077
没有
Never.

511
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:37,317
先生 如果Cadogan West是罪犯
Sir, Cadogan West is the culprit.

512
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:38,910
那他必定是复制了钥匙
He must have had duplicates.

513
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,235
噢 就是他干的
Oh, he's the culprit all right.

514
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,918
想到West这样的人
It's dreadful to think that West of all people

515
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,178
会做出这种事 让人非常难过
should have done such a thing.

516
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,323
你确定他有罪?
You're sure of his guilt?

517
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,067
我没发现有别的可能
I see no other way.

518
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,920
他要结婚了
He was getting married,

519
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:53,114
他需要钱
he wanted the money.

520
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:56,812
是的 他就是你找的人
Oh yes, he's your man.

521
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,569
Johnson先生
Mr. Johnson,

522
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:01,280
如果有人想卖掉计划书
if someone desired to sell the plans

523
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:06,062
复制一份比拿走原件
surely it would be easier to make copies

524
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,690
不是要简单得多?
than to take the originals.

525
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,907
那需要一定的专业知识
It would need considerable technical knowledge.

526
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,800
可以让我看看吗
May I see these?

527
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:15,956
当然了
And, of course,

528
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,052
你和West还有James Walter爵士
you and West and Sir James Walter

529
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:18,821
都有这样的专业知识
have that knowledge.

530
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:19,836
应该是吧
That may be so,

531
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,859
但是别把我也扯进来 福尔摩斯先生
but don't try to drag me into this matter, Mr. Holmes.

532
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,822
计划书是在West身上找到的
The plans were found on West.

533
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,078
可奇怪的是
Well, it is certainly singular

534
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:28,761
明明复制文件更安全
that he should risk taking the originals

535
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,521
他却冒险拿走了原件
when he could have safely taken copies.

536
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,232
也许是时间问题
Perhaps it was a matter of time.

537
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,471
噢 是啊 时间
Oh, yes, time.

538
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:40,083
我知道 丢掉的3页计划书
Now, three plans are missing I understand,

539
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,135
-是非常重要的部分 -是这样的
-they are the vital ones. -That is so.

540
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,150
有人得到了这3页
Now, someone holding those three papers,

541
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:46,160
我是说 他们能不能
I mean, could they construct

542
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,422
造出布鲁斯-帕廷顿潜水艇呢?
the Bruce Partington Submarine?

543
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:53,590
向海军部报告时 我认为那很有可能
I told the Admiralty that I thought it was possible

544
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:56,996
但今天我不是很确定了
but today I'm not so sure.

545
00:27:57,865 --> 00:28:00,294
这种极为重要的
These all important double-valves

546
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,071
双阀门自动调节孔的图样
with the automatic self-adjusting slots

547
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,685
是画在
are drawn only on this plan

548
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:07,831
已经找回的一张文件上的
which has been returned.

549
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:08,449
能不能请你
Would you be so kind

550
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,800
像周一晚上一样
as to close those window shutters

551
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:12,085
关上这些百叶窗
exactly as they were on Monday night.

552
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,346
百叶窗? 好的
Window shutters, certainly.

553
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:33,776
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

554
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,356
好的
Yes.

555
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:52,952
我想 我得出去走走了
I think I'll take a little stroll outside.

556
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,332
噢 请别担心
Oh, please don't trouble yourself.

557
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,151
我知道方位
I can find my own way.

558
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:28,039
稍等
Would you please wait.

559
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:32,069
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

560
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:33,433
华生
Watson.

561
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,402
看这里
Look at this.

562
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,936
花丛被人压过
The bushes have been broken.

563
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,646
看看我身后的窗户
Now look at the windows behind me.

564
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:57,308
窗户中间没有合上
The shutters don't meet in the center.

565
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,567
如你所说 没合上
As you say, don't meet.

566
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:03,348
有意思吧
Interesting, don't you think?

567
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:13,181
8点15分 伦敦桥 我能肯定
8:15, the London Bridge.

568
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,348
你确定他就是Cadogan West?
You definitely recognize him as Cadogan West?

569
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:16,724
噢 是的 肯定是
Oh, yes, definitely.

570
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,225
我和他很熟 先生
I knew him well, sir.

571
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:21,185
他是老相识了
He was an old acquaintance.

572
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:22,364
我们上次寒暄到现在
Hardly a week went by

573
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,242
还不到一周
that we didn't pass the time of day together.

574
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,963
很难接受吧?
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

575
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,384
是啊 我周日晚上还跟妻子说
Yeah,I was saying to the wife early on Sunday night,

576
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,512
不对 是周六
no, I'm a liar, it was Saturday.

577
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:35,888
我说 没有铁路比伦敦的铁路
I said there is no safer railway

578
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,847
更安全了
than the London Metropolitan.

579
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:44,441
看上去 West先生是在跟踪谁吗?
Did Mr. West seem to be following anyone?

580
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:47,740
我认为没有 福尔摩斯先生
Not that I saw, Mr. Holmes,

581
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,620
我什么都没看见
but then I don't see everything.

582
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:52,849
那天晚上雾非常大
There was really thick fog that night.

583
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,110
不过我可以看得出来
But one thing I will say

584
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,725
West先生和平时不一样
Mr. West wasn't his usual self.

585
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:00,426
他很紧张 很激动
He was nervous, excited.

586
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:01,603
这个人
I tell you this gentleman,

587
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:03,529
他的手抖得很厉害
his hand was shaking so bad.

588
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,959
还是我帮他拿的零钱
I had to open up his change.

589
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,233
嗯 我想这是不言而喻的
Well, I mean that speaks for itself.

590
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,719
我们的火车来了

591
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,103
请原谅
Our train.

592
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:13,157
Forgive us.

593
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,734
来吧 华生
Come Watson.

594
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,167
请进
Come in.

在
Yes.

598
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,562
您出去的时候
Whilst you were away

599
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,418
政府有封信给您
a message came for you from the government.

600
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,227

From the government?

一个坐着官方马车的政府官员
A official gentlemen

602

他说在我把它交给你之前

603
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:48,019
He said I wasn't to let this out of my sight

604
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:50,307
绝不能让它离开我视线
until I placed it into your own hands.

Mrs. Hudson,

医生对象形文字

00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:05,783
"整个英国的军队都归你调遣"
if you should need it.

638
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,282
"Mycroft"
Mycroft.

639
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,465
在这件事情上
All the queens' horses and all the queens' men

640
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:12,663
女王的兵马都无济于事
cannot avail us in this matter.

641
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,108
Coffield花园
Coffield Gardens.

642
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:25,786
好吧 好吧
Well, well.

643
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,452
发现什么了?
What have you found?

644
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:33,314
事情朝我们这边变化了
Things are turning a little in our direction.

645
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:34,849
现在我可以相信
Now I really believe

646
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,316
我们最终会胜利的
we're going to pull it off after all.

647
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:44,056
我要出去一趟
I'm going out.

648
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:44,923
什么时候回来?
When will you be back?

649
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,281
不确定 不过我保证
I have no idea but I promise I will

650
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:49,235
没有我最信任的伙伴兼传记作者在身边
do nothing serious without my trusty comrade

651
00:33:49,313 --> 00:33:51,778
我不会冒险的
and biographer at my elbow.

652
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,094
他要我在Gloster路的一家餐馆
He wants me to meet him in a restaurant

653
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,807
和他见面
off of Gloster Road.

654
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:36,475
我希望你小心一点
I just hope you'll be careful

655
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,049
就这样
that's all.

656
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,824
你已经不年轻了
You're not as young as you were.

657
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,561
你知道福尔摩斯先生
You know what Mr. Holmes is like

658
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:44,730
一旦咬住就不松口
once he gets the bit between his teeth.

659
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,518
我知道
I do indeed.

660
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:48,820
晚安 Hudson太太
Goodnight Mrs. Hudson.

661
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:50,143
晚安 医生
Goodnight doctor.

662
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,267
谢谢
Thank you.

663
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,517
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

664
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,235
请这边坐
Have you the tools.

665
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:36,584
吃过饭了吗?
Have you had something to eat?

666
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,727
吃过了
Yes, indeed.

667
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:38,987
那就来杯咖啡或者甜酒吧
Then have a coffee or a curacao.

668
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:40,525
Gardeni先生
Senor Gardeni,

669
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,339
来一杯咖啡加一杯甜酒 给我的朋友
a coffee and a curacao please, for my friend.

670
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,664
试试他们这的雪茄吧
Try one of the proprietor cigars.

671
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:48,054
是没有毒的
They're nothing like as poisonous

672
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:49,147
不像人们想象那样
as one would expect.

673
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,415
噢 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

674
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,942
那么
Now,

675
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,510
关于我们行动的计划
for our plan of action.

676
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,159
华生 你现在也应该清楚
It was evident to you Watson

677
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,946
尸体是被人
that the body was placed

678
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:01,739
放在了车顶上
on the roof of the carriage.

679
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:02,697
也许是从桥上掉下来的
Or dropped from a bridge.

680
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:04,634
不 那不可能 肯定是放上去的
No, that's impossible, placed.

681
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:07,286
车顶是弧形的 四周没有栏杆
The carriage roofs are rounded with no rails.

682
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:10,182
但是如何放在上面的呢
But how could he be placed there?

683
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:11,675
某些路段
In some areas

684
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,776
伦敦的地铁
the London underground

685
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,661
是没有隧道的
runs clear of tunnels

686
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,588
而且恰好经过某些房子后面
and past the backs of houses.

687
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,041
当我发现
When I found

688
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,868
一位重要的国际特务
that a leading international agent

689
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:22,513
就住在这样的房子里
lived in just such a house.

690
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,034
看到你对我突然草率的举动表示吃惊 真让我高兴
I was so pleased that you were a little astonished

691
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:27,268
Hugo Oberstein
at my sudden [unintelligible].

692
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,339
Coffield花园13号
Hugo Oberstein

693
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,325
13, Coffield Gardens, of course.

694
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,057
没错
Exactly.

695
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,018
更令我满意的是
I was able to satisfy myself that not only

696
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:37,109
不仅那里的后窗朝向铁路

697
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,658
而且地处Richmond线 和Wyndam线的交汇处
do the backstairs windows open over the line

698
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,684
but the bowing to the intersection

699
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:41,521
of the Richmond and Wyndam lines

700
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:42,629
主干线的交叉点
were the Circle Line.

701
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:44,290
靠近Gloster路车站
Near Gloster road Station.

702
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,252
日常来往的火车

703
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:48,337
The trains are frequently held motionless

704
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:50,080
恰好会在那个地方停留
at that very spot.

705
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:52,800
太精彩了 你解决了
That's splendid.

706
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,476
那栋房子已经人去楼空
You got it.

707
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,121
Oberstein显然已经离开这个国家
There house appears to be unoccupied.

708
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,274
处理他的战利品呢
Oberstein obviously has gone abroad

709
00:36:57,275 --> 00:36:59,695
他没理由害怕搜捕
to dispose of his booty

710
00:36:58,004 --> 00:36:59,841
has no reason to fear a warrant.

711
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,030
也根本不会想到
And to spot an amateur burglary

712
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:02,173
有人会潜入他的住宅
would never occur to him

713
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:05,051
但我们就要这么做
but that is precisely what we're about to do.

714
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:08,372
为什么
Why, for what purpose?

715
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,798
我们要找到他们联络的信件
We cannot tell what correspondence

716
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:14,071
不 我不喜欢这样 福尔摩斯
they may have.

717
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:14,134
No, I don't like it, Holmes.

718
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,272
你可以放哨
You can keep watch.

719
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:17,183
犯法的事情我来做
I'll do the criminal part.

720
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:20,023
现在不是计较细节的时候
This is no time to stick to trifles.

721
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,007
想想海军部 想想内阁
Think of the Admiralty, think of the cabinet.

722
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:27,755
想想那位我们不能直呼其名的高贵女士
Think of the exalted person

723
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:28,726
herself who [unintelligible].

724
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:31,442
我们必须这么做
We're bound to go.

725
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,503
我知道你最终不会退缩的
I knew you wouldn't shrink at the last.

726
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:14,119
棘手的问题
Serious proposition,

727
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,130
上锁了 也上了门闩
locked and bolted.

728
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,934
我们最好去地下室
We may do better down there

729
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,155
啊 好多了
Ah, this is better.

730
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,349
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

731
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,495
别碰
Don't touch this.

732
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:47,249
这是他们放尸体的地方

733
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:48,297
Look where they've rested the body.

734
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,017
血迹
Blood.

735
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,023
这里也有
Blood again.

736
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:25,413
你怎么看?
Well, what do you think of that?

737
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:27,098
杰作
Masterpiece.

738
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,541
前所未有的成就
You've never risen to a greater height.

739
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,784
不 我可不同意
No, I cannot agree with you.

740
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:32,062
从我想到尸体
The moment I conceived the idea of the body

741
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,088
是被放在车顶的那一刻起
on the roof of the train

742
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:37,445
剩下的都是显而易见的了
the rest was inevitable.

743
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,341
嗯 新的吸墨纸
Hmm, fresh blotting paper.

744
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:25,469
为了掩盖痕迹

745
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:26,536
He's covered his tracks.

746
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:36,909
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

747
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:52,081
没有有用的
Means nothing.

748
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:11,553
似乎烧过旧报纸
Seems to have been burning old newspapers.

749
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,059
-我说福尔摩斯 -嗯
I say Holmes

750
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,661
为什么一个明显
Yes.

751
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,948
又脏又乱的男人
Why would a man so obviously

752
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:22,685
要费心去烧旧报纸呢
untidy of his habits

753
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:23,027
take the trouble to burn old newspapers?

754
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:23,986
也许想生火
Probably trying to start a fire.

755
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:27,503
是啊  不对 没有木柴也没有炭
Yeah, but there's no, no wood or coal.

756
00:42:30,844 --> 00:42:32,112
我看看
Let me see.

757
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:52,644
-哈 -是什么
Ha.

758
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,879
What is it?

759
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:57,800
干得好哇
Well done, well done.

760
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,602
我想我们找到要找的人了
Indeed, I think we have our man.

761
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,888
你来看看这两版 <每日邮报>上的寻人广告栏
Would you look in the agony column

762
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:07,001
我们可以找到一个 自称Piero的人发的消息
of the two remaining copies of The Daily Telegraph.

763
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,642
I think you will find a message from someone

764
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,220
Piero Piero Piero
calling himself Piero.

765
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,831
啊 有了
Piero, Piero, Piero.

766
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:11,256
"请尽快回复 同意条件"
Ah, here we are.

767
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,508
"但务必要完整报告"
Hope to hear soon the terms agreed

768
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,783
-"联系人Piero" -下一份
but must have full report.

769
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,830
Matter pressing signed Piero.

770
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:21,463
没错 上帝啊
Yes, by Jove.

771
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:24,811
"周一晚九时后 门上敲两下"
Monday night after 9:00, two taps, only on sills,

772
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,915
"交货后即付硬币"
payment in hard cash when goods delivered,

773
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:28,807
和那条一样 署名是Piero
signed Piero just like the other one.

774
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:30,034
每份报纸上都有
Every paper has a message

775
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:31,556
这个自称Piero人发的消息

776
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:33,241
这是个假名
from someone calling himself Piero.

777
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:35,744
就像Oberstein这种恶棍会用的
It's an odd name

778
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:36,698
要是我们可以
for the villain like Oberstein to use.

779
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,863
在另一头抓住这个人就好了
If only we could get the man

780
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,628
华生 快来
at the other end.

781
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:42,158
我们没时间耽搁了
Watson, quickly,

782
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:43,514
带上报纸
we haven't a moment to loose.

783
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,341
Bring the papers.

784
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,230
我们要去哪?
Where we going?

785
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,321
<每日邮报>报社 正好能赶上
The offices of the Daily Telegraph

786
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:04,066
精彩 真是精彩
Splendid job, splendid.

787
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:05,818
我经常说
I always said

788
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,904
如果你愿意
you'd the make best cat burglar in London

789
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:11,472
你会是伦敦最厉害的贼
if you put your mind to it.

790
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:14,601
警察可不能这么干 福尔摩斯先生
Can't do these things on the force, Mr. Holmes.

791
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,162
难怪你能比我们走得更远
No wonder you get results that are beyond us.

792
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:19,190
不过总有一天 你会走得太远
Some of these days you'll go too far

793
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,728
给你和你的朋友带来麻烦
and you and your friend

794
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,613
我们肩负着祖国的重托 华生
will find yourselves in trouble.

795
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:25,824
甘当国家的殉道者
England home and duty, Watson.

796
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:29,237
<每日邮报>的寻人广告
Motto and the oath of our country.

797
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,700
The agony column of The Daily Telegraph.

798
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,814
你这是做什么用?
What use would you make of those?

799

你看过今天Piero 发的启事了吗?

800
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:35,962

804
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:53,220
我保证 如果他行动了 我们就能抓住他
By George,

805
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:54,485

醒醒
Wake up.

807
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:28,352
他来了
He's here.

808

你可以把我写成一个笨蛋 华生
You can write me down as an ass, Watson.

809
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:12,418
这可不是我能料到的家伙
This is not the bird I was expecting.

810
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:14,027
他是谁?
Who is he?

814
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:22,701
这是怎么回事?
What is this?

815
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:26,317
我是来找Oberstein先生的
I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.

我认识你 当然了..

817
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,204
夏洛克 福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

818
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,281
一切都水落石出了 上校
Everything is known, Colonel.

819
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:36,954
一个英国绅士
How an English gentlemen

820
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:38,441
居然做出这等行为
could behave in such a manner

821
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:40,741
真让人费解
is beyond comprehension.

822
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,254
我们知道你和Oberstein的关系
We know of your relations

823
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:45,155
也发现了你们的联系方式
and correspondence with Oberstein.

824

你偷了你哥哥的钥匙
You stole your brothers' keys

825

复制了一套
and had them duplicated.

826

我们知道你周一晚上 去了海军办公室

827
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:52,867
被Cadogan West发现
on Monday night

828
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:57,069
作为一个正直的公民
and was seen by Cadogan West.

829
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:57,646
Being the good citizen that he was.

830
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,789
他在浓雾之中紧紧跟着你
He followed you closely in the fog

831
00:46:58,789 --> 00:46:59,899
穿过了半个伦敦
halfway across London

832
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,067
直到你到了这所房子
until you reached this very house.

833
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:05,129
之后 Walter上校的叛国罪上面
It was then Colonel Walter that to treason

834
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,467
还要加上谋杀罪
you added the terrible crime of murder.

835
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:10,085
不是我
I did not.

836
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:13,399
我不是 我发誓 不是我干的
I did not before God.

837
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,918
那就告诉我们
I swear I did not.

838
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,987
在你们把他的尸体放上火车之前
Then tell us how Arthur Cadogan West

839
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:19,183
Arthur Cadogan West 是怎么死的?
met his end before you placed his body

840
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:21,417
如你所说 他一直跟着我
on the roof of the railway carriage?

841
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,852
He followed me as you described

842
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:24,087
到了这里的大门口
but until I was at the very door of this house

843
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,432
我才发现
I did not know it.

844
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,160
你拿着这些文件要做什么?
What are you gonna do with those papers?

845
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:16,199
他的头撞在了大理石地板上
He hit his head

846
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,144
几分钟以后就死了
on the marble floor.

847
00:48:16,987 --> 00:48:20,139
He was dead in a matter of minutes.

848
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:21,038
是Oberstein的主意
It was Oberstein's idea

849
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,760
把不那么重要的文件 放在West的口袋里
to stuff the less important plans

850
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,488
然后把他扔到火车顶上
in West's pocket

851
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:26,470
and put him on the roof of the train.

852
00:48:32,628 --> 00:48:36,606
是什么让你走上了叛国之路 上校?
What made you turn traitor, Colonel?

853
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,572
我有一大笔证券债务要偿还
A stock exchange debt had to be paid.

854
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:43,406
非常非常需要钱
I needed the money badly.

855
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:45,890
Oberstein出价5000磅
Oberstein offered me five thousand.

856
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:52,886
可以使我免于破产 声败名裂
It was to save myself from ruin and disgrace.

857
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,224
我哥哥以前和我讨论事情
My brother used to discuss matters with me

858
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,967
他实在不应该那么做
which he probably should not have done.

859
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:01,123
潜水艇计划
This submarine, for instance.

860
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,060
他怎么能想到
How could he ever guess

861
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:07,413
是他的亲弟弟背叛了他?
his own brother would betray him?

862
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,620
最糟糕的是
That was the worst of all.

863
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,817
他早怀疑我了 我知道的
He suspected me.

864
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,673
我能从他的眼神中看出来
I know he did.

865
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:16,811
I read it in his eyes.

866
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:18,219
West出事之后
And after this West business

867
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:21,842
他再也抬不起头来了
he never held up his head again.

868
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:25,814
嗯 你愿不愿意弥补你的过错
Can you not make reparation, hmmm,

869
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:27,834
减轻你的羞愧
to ease your conscious

870
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:29,846
甚至是你的惩罚?
and possibly your punishment?

871
00:49:29,846 --> 00:49:32,377
我能怎么弥补?
What reparation can I make?

872
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:33,982
Oberstein带着文件去了哪里?
Where is Oberstein with the papers?

873
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:35,441
我不知道
I do not know.

874
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:39,722
他说写信到巴黎的Delu酒店 可以联系到他
He said that letters to the Hotel Delu in Paris

875
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:45,074
啊 那你就可以帮我们了
would reach him.

876
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:43,435
Ah, well then it is possible

877
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,382
for you to help us.

878
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,382
过来坐下
Come and sit down

879
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,170
我说你写
and write my dictation.

880
00:50:03,072 --> 00:50:04,257
"亲爱的先生"
Dear sir,

881
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:07,705
"关于我们的交易"
in regard to our transaction

882
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:08,765
"你也许已经发现"
you have now observed

883
00:50:08,766 --> 00:50:11,343
"尚缺一个重要细节"
that one essential detail is missing

884
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,194
"我这里已有图纸"
but I have a tracing

885
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:13,946
"可使其完整"
that will make it complete.

886
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:15,422
是真的吗 夏洛克?
Is that true, Sherlock?

887
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:16,999
千真万确
Quite true.

888
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,303
缺少什么重要的细节?
What essential detail is missing?

889
00:50:19,882 --> 00:50:21,634
双阀门
The double-valves,

890
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:24,413
自动调节孔
the automatic self-adjusting slots.

891
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:27,479
我的天哪 你是怎么知道的?
Good heavens.

892
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:29,580
我已经是个潜水艇专家了
How on earth did you know that?

893
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:29,599
I've become quite a submarine expert

894
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,880
我亲爱的哥哥
brother of mine.

895
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:32,809
上校
Now Colonel,

896
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,450
你打算要价多少?
what would be your terms?

897
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:45,915
"我要额外增加500磅"
I must ask you for a further 500 pounds,

898
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,672
"只要英镑"
English notes please.

899
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,000
"我期待在..."
I should expect to meet you...

900
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,877
嗯 我们不能写这里
well, we can hardly say here

901
00:50:56,878 --> 00:50:58,812
Oberstein会怀疑是陷阱的
or Oberstein will suspect a trap.

902
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:02,451
在Charring Cross酒店的大堂见面吧

00:51:02,452 --> 00:51:04,769
靠近火车站
Charring Cross Hotel.

904
00:51:03,152 --> 00:51:04,989
Its proximity to the railway station

905
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,684
想必在国际特务中间
renders it extremely popular

906
00:51:06,684 --> 00:51:09,415
很有名呢
amongst the international spy fraternity.

907
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:10,825
你听见了吗 上校?
Did you get that Colonel?

908
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:15,583
"下周六中午"
Noon, Saturday next.

909
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,357
如果这都不能引蛇出洞
I should be very surprised

910
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:20,534
我会非常吃惊的
if that does not flush our man out.

911
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,479
人来了
That's our man.

912
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,324
好啊 Bradstreet
Splendid Bradstreet.

913
00:52:58,331 --> 00:53:00,654
不过我们的叛国者逃了
But our traitor has flown.

914
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,862
真是个小人
What a damn cheat of a fellow

915
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:05,889
再见了 先生们
Goodbye, gentlemen.

916
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:09,545
我会追他到天涯海角
I'm keeping him on a long lead.

917
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:15,526
天气真冷啊 (从"九月"到"四月"的寒冷季节里都有单词R 有"不到这时候不要吃牡蛎"的说法)
There's an R in the month

918
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,931
我知道Diogenes俱乐部
and the Diogenes Club

919
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:20,201
供应最棒的牡蛎
has the most excellent oysters.

920
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:24,525
我想请你们两位一起来品尝一下
I should like both you gentlemen to be my guests.

921
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:28,342
走吧 夏洛克
Come along, Sherlock.

922
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:37,308
