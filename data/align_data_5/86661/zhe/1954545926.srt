嗯 我的丈夫
Well, it's some years

81
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,025

00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,464
我跟他有些浅交

他看上去是那么充满活力

97
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,930
很难把他和死亡联系在一起

他的感情过于丰富了

他们说是肺炎

是由脾脏破裂引起的
brought on by a ruptured spleen

106
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,222
不过我今天请你们来
but it's not to talk of my grandson

107
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,577

113
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:13,570
三天前我接到一个房产经纪的电话

114
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:16,236
钱不是问题 夫人
The money is no object, Madame.

115
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:20,392
可是附近有好几间待售的屋子呢
But there's several empty houses around here on the market.

116
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:26,624
不 就要这间 我的委托人对这间屋子情有独钟
No, this, my client's heart is set on this one.

117

你开个价好吗?

我开的价比买进价高了500英镑

120
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,464

00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,878
是的

123
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,588
有些家具可是上等质地的啊
But some of it's very good.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,639
尽管开价就行 Maberley太太
Just state your price, Mrs. Maberley.

125
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:51,828
于是我就开了个高价 他马上就答应了
So I did, a good round sum and he agreed at once.

126
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,966
我一直希望有可能的话能去周游世界
You see I've always wanted to travel around the world if I could.

127

这也是我先生的遗愿

128

我们从未实现过
No less, we never really achieved it.

129
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:05,538
那人第二天回来时 是不是把协议都起草好了?
The man returned the next day with everything drawn up?

130
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:11,108
就是昨天的事 幸好我把协议 给我的律师Sutro先生看了
Yesterday, luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer.

131
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,392
真是怪事
This is very strange.

132
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:18,086
你有没有注意到 协议不许你带走房子里的任何东西
Are you aware that you cannot take anything out of the house

133
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:21,110
甚至是你个人的财产也不行?
not even your own personal possessions?

134
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:23,440
我的衣服也不行吗?
Not my clothes,

135
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:24,682
还有我的珠宝?

136
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,223
什么都不行
Anything.

137
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,615
那个人再来的时候
When the man returned to the house

138
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:28,824
您有没有向他指出这一点?
you pointed this out?

139
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,190
有的
Yes.

140
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:33,653
他说我可以带走一些个人的东西
He said I might take some personal effects

141
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,111
但是要带走的东西 一律得经过检查

142
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:41,404
我的委托人很慷慨
My client is very liberal

143
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,162
但有些怪癖 夫人
but has fads, Madame,

144
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,685
做事情有他自己的方式
and a way of doing things.

145
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,611
你的东西嘛 我的委托人要么就全要
I'm afraid it must be everything

146
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:53,406
要么就全部都不要
or nothing for my client.

147
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,523
那就全都不要好了
Then it must be nothing.

148
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:59,980
这就是他的名片
Here it is.

149
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:05,079
Haines Johnson 拍卖估价师 没有留下地址
Haines Johnson, auctioneer valuer no address.

150
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:07,457
我怀疑我们能否在号码本里找到他
I doubt we shall find him in the directory,

151
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,930
诚实的人不会隐瞒自己的地址的
honest men don't conceal their place of business.

152
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,557
对于偷听的来说 你的喘息声太大了
Just a little wheezy for eavesdropping.

153
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:33,148
我只不过想进来问问
I just came in to find out

154
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,927
客人们是否会留下来用午餐 夫人
if the visitors were staying for lunch, Madame.

155
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,881
别逼我用这个
Don't force me to use this.

156
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,730
Maberley太太
Mrs. Maberley, did you mention to anyone

157
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:44,196
您有没有跟别人说起过要向我咨询的事?
that you were going to consult me?

158
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,134
没有 福尔摩斯先生
I did not, Mr. Holmes.

159
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,249
信是谁寄的?
Who posted the letter?

160
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,437
Susan
Susan did.

161
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,497
Susan?
Susan?

162
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,131
哈 你把消息透露给谁了?
Ah, to whom did you send your message?

163
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,037
我没有向别人透露什么消息
I sent no message.

164
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,343
告诉我
Tell me?

165
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,833
Susan 我记起来了
Susan, I remember now,

166
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,753
我看见你在篱笆那里跟人说话来着
I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.

167
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,886
那是我的私事 夫人
That was my own business, Madame.

168
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,289
是Barney Stockdale
Barney Stockdale.

169
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:08,955
怎么可能
Fine chance that would be.

170
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,234
我都不认识他
I didn't even know the man.

171
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,108
要是你告诉我 这事是谁在背后搞的鬼
It is worth 10 pounds to you

172
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,295
我给你10英镑
if you tell me who is at the back of this.

173
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,153
你的10英镑的消息
Someone who could lay down 1,000 pounds

174
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,875
有人可愿意花上1000镑呢
for every 10 you've got in the world.

175
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:25,440
我看见一个有钱人在微笑
I see a rich man who smiled,

176
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,950
是一个有钱的女人
a rich woman.

177
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,652
把名字告诉我 你就可以把钱拿去
Tell me the name and earn the money.

178
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:36,238
我要先看到你下地狱
I'll see you in hell first.

179
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:42,062
明天我派人来取我的箱子 夫人
I'll send for my box tomorrow, Madame.

180
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,903
这群团伙出现意味着有猫腻
This gang means business.

181
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,230
可是他们想要什么呢?
But what can they possibly want?

182
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,080
Maberley太太
Mrs. Maberley,

183
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,425
您说您在这房子里住了有一年了?
you say you've been in this house for a year?

184
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,467
差不多两年
Nearly two.

185
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,842
这么说 近两年来
So for nearly two years

186
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,108
没人对这房子 有什么特别的兴趣
no one has taken any particular interest in the house

187
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,061
然而就在三四天前 突然就有人这么急需
and yet suddenly within three or four days

188
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,599
这房子和里头的东西
urgent demands are made for it and its contents.

189
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,553
房子里肯定添置了什么新的东西
Something new must've been brought into the house.

190
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,557
没有 我有一年多没买什么新东西了
No, I haven't bought anything new for a year.

191
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:18,158
这个Susan来这儿多久了?
This, Susan, how long has she been with you?

192
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,225
大概三个星期
Almost three weeks.

193
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,322
就在你孙子死后吗?
Since your grandson's death?

194
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,078
他去世一星期后的事
A week after.

195
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,939
她向我自荐
She presented herself

196
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,977
而我就雇佣了她
and I took her in I suppose

197
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,408
呃 也没有什么介绍信
without proper reference.

198
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,898
这蛋糕很好吃
You know, this cake is delicious.

199
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:46,892
能说说 您孙子从意大利回来的情形吗?
Please, now will you tell us about the circumstances of your grandson's return to Italy?

200
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,096
我那多情的孩子
My gallant boy.

201
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:54,231
你也许还记得 他曾是一个 多么快活 优秀的人吧 华生医生
You may remember him as debonair and splendid, Dr. Watson.

202
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,781
你都没有看到
You didn't see the morose

203
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,317
他变得多么郁郁寡欢心事重重
and brooding creature he became.

204
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,335
他的心都碎了
His heart was broken.

205
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,131
一月之间
In a single month

206
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:10,398
我看着他变成了一个衰弱又愤世嫉俗的人
I watched him turn into a worn out cynical man.

207
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,200
女人吗?
A woman?

208
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,610
他不肯说
He wouldn't speak of it.

209
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:23,975
他说他怕让他的奶奶也跟着烦恼
He was afraid of upsetting his grandma he said.

210
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:28,282
那您一直都不知道她的名字了?
And so you never learnt her name?

211
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:40,895
今晚最好能有人
It might be advisable

212
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,886
跟您呆在一起
for someone to stay with you tonight.

213
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,969
华生?
Watson?

214
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,714
好的 没问题
Yes, of course.

215
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,146
不 我真的不能麻烦你
No, I really couldn't ask such a thing.

216
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,828
不不不 我们要走了
No, no, no, we're leaving.

217
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:58,451
谢谢 Maberley太太
Thank you, Mrs. Maberley,

218
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:00,843
我天黑前回来
I shall be back before dark,

219
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,806
您别担心
don't concern yourself.

220
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,802
也许要找到这个人才行
It might be useful to find this

221
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,320
她叫什么?  Violet吗?
what's she called, Violet.

222
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,822
他也许向她透露了什么事情
He may have confided something to her

223
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,923
他到死也没有
that he didn't tell his grandmother

224
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,851
跟他奶奶说起的事情
in his last hours.

225
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,624
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

226
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,812
下午好 Dixie先生
Good Afternoon Mr. Dixie.

227
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,925
那老太太和她的房子
The old lady and the house

228
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,409
都在我的保护之下
are both under my protection

229
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,173
你可别忘了
and don't you forget it.

230
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,632
看看他们是不是走了
Make sure they're gone.

231
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,831
今晚带上你的手枪
Bring your revolver tonight.

232
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,313
D代表Douglas Maberley
D, Douglas Maberley,

233
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,218
出色 快活
splendid, debonair,

234
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,999
同时又阴郁 愤世嫉俗
too morose, cynical,

235
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,312
好重的词
strong words.

236
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,038
噢 不
Oh, no,

237
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,001
这个没有眼睛的女士是谁?
who is this lady with no eyes?

238
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,982
我们去那边查
Our course lies there.

239
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,456
应该是样连她自己都不知道 已经在手上的东西
There must be something she doesn't know she has.

240
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,685
就算她知道 也许也不肯告诉我们
And probably wouldn't tell us even if she did know.

241
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,017
这案子要找Langdale Pike
This is a case for Langdale Pike.

242
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,320
那个卑鄙的无赖
That reptile.

243
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,135
胡说
Nonsense, don't talk rubbish.

244
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,668
他是个爱讲闲话的人
He's a gossip,

245
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,607
但是...也许他能指认出那个贵妇人
but he might identify this rich woman.

246
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,048
真是令人难过 他在大学的时候可是很出色的
Sad, he was brilliant at university,

247
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,303
我总觉得 在他外表之下
and you know, I've always felt that under that veneer

248
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,494
藏着一颗孤独的心
that he was totally isolated.

249
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,794
就像我
Like me.

250
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,181
你看到了吗?
You see that?

251
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,606
那边在树下的女孩
That young girl there, under the tree,

252
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,138
戴着一顶应景的帽子
with the occasional hat,

253
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,106
你觉得她在干嘛?
what do you make of her?

254
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,559
她在找她的狗
She's looking for her dog.

255
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,572
什么?
What?

256
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:51,729
-不 当然不是 -一条萨卢基狗
-No, no, surely. -A saluki,

257
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,065
也许戴着松绿色的项圈
with a turquoise collar perhaps.

258
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,253
她对这公园很陌生
She's a stranger in the park

259
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,191
她的狗也是
so is the dog.

260
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,692
它来了
There it is now.

261
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,541
你怎么知道的?
How did you know that?

262
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:12,601
她的靴子是乡村款式的
Her boots are country boots

263
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,150
但已经不够结实
but not so robust,

264
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,503
说明她来自崎岖的丘陵地区
as to suggest a rough terrain.

265
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,952
Wiltshire来的
Wiltshire,

266
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:20,404
也许是来自Gloucestershire
Gloucestershire perhaps.

267
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,770
是的 是的 但是...
Yes, yes, yes, but,

268
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:26,927
你有没有发现她很迷人?
don't you find her attractive?

269
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,809
好吧
All right.

270
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,514
为什么是一条萨卢基狗?
Why saluki?

271
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,542
人们常说"狗似主人形"
Owners are meant to look like their dogs, they say,

272
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,754
难道不就是萨卢基了吗?
wouldn't you say, saluki?

273
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,869
厉害
Remarkable.

274
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,702
事实上
She is in point of fact,

275
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,093
她是Geraldine Windridge小姐
Lady Geraldine Windridge

276
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,699
来自Wiltshire的Marlborough家的近亲
the close Marlborough, Wiltshire.

277
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:55,807
现在说说 亲爱的福尔摩斯 你找我干嘛来了?
And now my, dear Holmes, what is it you want from me?

278
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,874
是关于已故的Douglas Maberley
The late Douglas Maberley.

279
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:01,810
可怜的孩子
Poor boy,

280
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:05,150
真是可惜了
and what a waste.

281
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,334
他与一位女士有染
He was involved with a lady

282
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,884
一位贵妇人
a well placed rich lady.

283
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,238
你知道吗?
Known to you?

284
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,083
你有什么可以交换的吗
Have you something to trade,

285
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,225
有来有往?
tittle for tattle?

286
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:44,343
Langdale 我很急的
Langdale, I'm in a hurry.

287
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,885
嗯 谢谢
Hmm, thank you.

288
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,943
她名叫Isadora Klein

289
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,915
啊 没错 是德国糖业大王的遗孀

290
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,045
相当出名的一位美人儿

291
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:01,148
著名的美人儿

00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,072
Pike还告诉你什么了
What else did Pike tell you,

295
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,479
有没有告诉你她和Maberley的事?
anything about her and Maberley?

296
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:16,542
没有
Nothing.

297
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,495
福尔摩斯
I wonder, Holmes,

298
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:23,426
你觉得有没有可能 她想拿回一些有损声名的信件?
do you think it could be about some compromising letters she wants retrieved,

299
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:26,759
特别是会影响她即将举行的婚礼的信件
I mean particularly in view of her forthcoming marriage.

300
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:27,776
你是说情信吗?
You mean love letters?

301
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:31,253
不 不 应该不止这样
No, no, it's deeper than that.

302
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,884
听着 我要你
Listen, I demand that you spend

303
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,971
在三角墙山庄
a sleepless night

304
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,432
彻夜守候
at the Three Gables

305
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,236
枪不离手
with that revolver at hand.

306
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,885
你今晚怎么过?
How will you be spending the evening?

307
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,824
从另一个角度追踪这个案件
Pursuing the matter from another angle,

308
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,397
去查一下当事人
examining the principal.

309
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:58,401
你有什么要告诉我的 Miguel?
So, what is it you have to tell me, Miguel?

她声称是被歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生撵走的
Was forced to leave she claims by Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

313

他无视我们要他远离Harrow的要求
He's refused our request to avoid Harrow.

314
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,875
歇洛克.福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes,

315
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,875
那是因为你的要求不够强硬
then you did not request him hard enough.

316
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:19,695
那么
Well,

317
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:24,997
歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生在调查这个案子了
so Mr. Sherlock Holmes is on the case.

318

他拜访了那位老妇人
He paid a visit to the old lady

319
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:28,535
不过空手而返
but left empty handed.

320
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:29,609
不用担心
Have no fear.

321
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,614
我们时间不多了 Miguel
We're losing time, Miguel,

322
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,183

324

这位福尔摩斯先生倒是引起了我的兴趣
This Mr. Sherlock Holmes intrigues me.

325
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:44,670
他聪明吗?

他可是声名在外
He has a reputation.

327

侦破疑案很出名 没错
For solving crimes, yes,

328
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,075
可是对付女人呢?
but for women?

329
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:41,324
你还欠我一个人情 伙计 你记得吗?
You still owe me a favor dear boy, remember?

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,645
你要是不还我人情
I shan't destroy the paper

331
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,214
那张纸我可不撕掉
until you've returned the compliment,

332
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,982
还记得吧 有来有往?
remember tittle for tattle?

333
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,659
看看你 到底怎么啦?
Look at you, I mean what's all this?

334

啊 当然了

335
00:22:56,199 --> 00:23:00,267
我们现在参加的是中产阶级的化妆晚会
we are above the bourgeois epitan costume,

336
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:01,600
狂欢已经开始了
the revels have begun.

337
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:05,564
就算没有你那朦胧的谜题 生活也已经够神秘了
Life is mystery enough without your pale conundrums.

338
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,704
噢 这么多人
Oh, so many people,

339
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,009
却如此没有目标
so little purpose.

340
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:12,170
那是上帝的谜题
That's God's conundrum.

341
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,519
要是我们这样的凡夫俗子能回答就好了
If only we mortals could answer that.

342
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,572
那你的生活也没什么意思了
Then your life would have no meaning.

343
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,581
真实却又残酷  残酷但很真实
True, cruel, cruel but so true.

344

我总是说我们已故的朋友

00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:36,982
我秘而不宣的事比我透露的可是多得多
I suppress much, much more than I expose,

348
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:41,116
否则 这世界会怎样呢?
what sort of world would it be if I didn't?

349

她是哪一位?
Which one is she?

350
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:45,968

00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:17,135
也希望得到一切

359

嫁给一位出身平凡 不名一文的外交官

死后还握着她的什么把柄
even in death to have some hold over her,

366
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:39,404

我给你提供的资料 你想怎么用都行

那时他是个身无分文的推销员

事实对她不利
The facts do her no credit.

466
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:25,412
福尔摩斯 她现在很虚弱
Holmes, she's in a very frail condition.

467
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,890
医生 先医好你自己再说吧
Physician, heal thyself.

468
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:44,854
福尔摩斯先生 你可真好
Mr. Holmes, how good of you.

469
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,137
您觉得怎么样?
How are you feeling?

470
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,762
呃 我还活着
Well, I'm alive

471
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,717
多亏了您勇敢的朋友 华生医生
thanks to your brave friend Dr. Watson.

472
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:55,941
他把它从他们手里夺回来了吗?
Did he get it back from them?

473
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:57,688
夺回什么?
Get what?

474
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,952
噢 对了 你还不知道 我没有...
Oh, of course you wouldn't know. I don't...

475
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,642
福尔摩斯先生 我得向您道歉
Mr. Holmes I owe you an apology.

476
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,636
我原先希望它跟这件事无关 可它真的有关
I prayed it would have no bearing but it does.

477
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:13,710
我真是太蠢了
Oh, it's so stupid of me.

478
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,979
它就是一切的根源
It's the reason for everything.

479
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:22,624
Douglas在写书
Douglas was writing a book.

480
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,309
他说书里会解释一切
He said it would explain it all.

481
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:27,627
他在罗马的时候开始提笔
He started it in Rome

482
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,929
后来他们把他送回这里后
and later when they brought him back here,

483
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:36,008
他就在那个通风的避暑亭里 坐上几个小时写东西
he sat for hours in that drafty little summer house,

484
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:39,498
甚至在十分糟糕的天气里
writing sometimes in the most dreadful weather.

485
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,080
后来他连床都起不来了
And later when he could no longer leave his room,

486
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,627
可他还是挣扎着写他的书
he still struggled with it.

487
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,918
有两本
Two copies,

488
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:01,264
一本他给了Violet
one he gave to Violet

489
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,253
要她把书寄给某个人
and told her to deliver it to someone.

490
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,473
我不知道是谁
I don't know who.

491
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,717
他要她发誓保密的
He had sworn her to secrecy,

492
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:13,663
而她也信守诺言
and she kept her promise.

493
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,480
另外一本
The other copy,

494
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,153
他催促我
he urged me,

495
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,514
几乎用尽他的最后一口气
almost with his dying breath

496
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,033
要我把它拿给他的出版商
to send it to his publisher.

497
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,368
我本来是要这么做的
I should've done so

498
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:53,037
不过就在他下葬的那一夜
but on the night of his funeral,

499
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:57,362
我太想念他了 于是就把整本书都看了
and missing him so much I read it through.

500
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:02,217
我马上就知道那本书是什么了 那是他的一生
I knew at once what it was, his life.

501
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:04,736
还有那个女人
That woman,

502
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:07,308
我甚至连她的名字都不知道
I didn't even know her name.

503
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,852
想到这本书会引发的丑闻
The scandal it would cause

504
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:15,948
我就把它埋在了心底
and I shut it out of my mind,

505
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,411
锁了起来
locked it away,

506
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:21,752
昨天晚上是华生医生让我想起了它
and then last night when Dr. Watson reminded me.

507
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,507
当时他们在等你吗?
And they were waiting for you?

508
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:27,923
是的 他们把它从我手里抢走
Yes, and they snatched it from me

509
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,327
当时我想把它拿上去给医生看的
as I was taking it up to him.

510
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:36,656
只有这张没有拿走
All but this.

511
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:48,147
我从那个畜生手上撕下来的
I tore it from the brute.

512
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:02,442
它在哪?
Where is it?

513
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,628
它在哪?
Where is it?

514
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:05,107
Miguel
Miguel.

515
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,907
Miguel
Miguel.

516
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,457
最后一页 最后一页在哪儿?
The page, where is the last page?

517
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,085
他拿了 我知道 是他拿了
He has it, I know he has it.

518
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:15,867
一页纸 Carina
One page, Carina,

519
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,705
就算是福尔摩斯也不能...
not even Sherlock Holmes can do anything with...

520
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,968
把它烧了 别说了 把它烧了
Burn it, Don't talk, burn it.

521
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:28,950
脸上淌着血
Face bled,

522
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:32,694
那些无情的殴打 让他的腹中好像被火烧着一般
his stomach burned from the savage blows

523
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:37,772
可这些比起他滴血的心来说 根本算不得什么
but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart

524
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,379
当他看见她那可爱的脸庞
when he saw that lovely face,

525
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:45,809
一张他愿意为之牺牲一切的脸庞
a face, which he had been prepared to sacrifice his life for.

526
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,527
她在笑
She smiled,

527
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,914
是的 苍天可鉴 她在微笑
yes by heavens, she smiled

528
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,557
就像是个无情的魔鬼
like the heartless fiend she was.

529
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:54,150
就在那一刻
It was at that moment

530
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:57,702
爱情死去了
that love died,

531
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:00,138
憎恨却萌生了
and hate was born.

532
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:04,529
如果不是为了你的怀抱
If it is not for your embrace my lady,

533
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,107
那就是为你的毁灭!  我的夫人
then it shall be for your undoing

534
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:10,131
为了我彻底的复仇
and my complete revenge.

535
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:14,805
我彻底的复仇
My complete revenge,

536
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:17,994
书里的"他"变成了"我"
The he becomes my.

537
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,988
作者把自己想象为男主人公
Yes, the writer imagines himself the hero.

538
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,622
有两本
Two copies,

539
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,902
一本给了Klein夫人
one to Mrs. Klein.

540
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,043
而这本则要出版
And this for publication.

541
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:35,478
整个伦敦都会认出
All London would recognize,

542
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,649
人物的原型
the wool from the lamb.

543
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,057
甜蜜的复仇
Sweet revenge.

544
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,119
再把第一句读来听听
Read me that first sentence again.

545
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,433
脸上淌着血
Face bled,

546
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:48,764
那些无情的殴打 让他的腹中好像被火烧着一般
his stomach burned from the savage blow.

547
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:50,471
这就是死因
The cause of death.

548
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:59,657
那老太太说肺炎是脾脏破裂引起的
Pneumonia from a ruptured spleen the old woman said.

549
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:01,772
天哪
Good heavens,

550
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,880
被踢破的
ruptured from a kick,

551
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,552
那是谋杀
that's murder.

552
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,841
可是我们无法证明
We could never prove it.

553
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,523
我要去Cricklewood
I'm leaving for Cricklewood.

554
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,503
Steve
Steve,

555
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:22,889
五个月前的Grover广场?
Grover's Square five months ago?

556
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:25,587
那不是我 福尔摩斯先生
That wasn't me, Mr. Holmes.

557
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:27,134
你不能把那栽在我头上
You can't put that on me.

558
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:29,434
是谁的靴子踢死了Douglas Maberley
It doesn't matter whose boot

559
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,371
也不要紧吗?
killed Douglas Maberley,

560
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:34,642
你们都是有罪的
you're all guilty.

561
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:37,943
哈 Susan
Ha, Susan,

562
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:44,216
Susan 在你丈夫坐牢的时候
Susan, guarding the coop

563
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,862
看着你的鸡舍吧
while your husband is in prison.

564
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:50,336
新来的是谁 Barney Stockdale太太?
What's the new member Mrs. Barney Stockdale?

565
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:51,432
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

566
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,427
小心点 福尔摩斯
Take care, Holmes.

567
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:56,767
你们从这滚出去
You get out of here.

568
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:58,940
那女人会让你坐牢的
That woman will put you behind bars

569
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:00,947
就为你昨晚做的那事
for what you did last night.

570
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,103
而她的雇主
And her employer,

571
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,039
Grosvenor广场的Klein太太
Mrs. Klein of Grosvenor Square

572
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:07,469
会看着你们全都因谋杀罪而被绞死
will see you all hanged for murder

573
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:11,792
除非你照我说的去做
unless you do what I tell you, when I tell you.

574
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,582
记住 Hobin的Perkins
Remember, Perkins of Hobin.

575
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:18,159
华生
Watson.

576
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,314
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

577
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,837
你看到什么了?
What do you see?

578
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,327
我看到了
I see,

579
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,161
我爱慕的女人
the woman I adore.

580
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,151
我准备好了
I'm ready now.

581
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:18,144
用不着 你就呆在这儿吧
No stay here,

582
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:21,934
她又不是Moriarty教授 她只不过是个女人
she's not Moriarty, she's a woman.

583
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,833
那只手需要补偿
That hand needs redressing.

584
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,991
记住 福尔摩斯
Just remember, Holmes,

585
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:41,294
女人可以比男人更致命
the female can be more deadly than the male.

586
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:59,800
估价师和拍卖人 哼
Valuer and auctioneer, my foot.

587
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,541
啊 夫人
Ah, Madame.

588
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:09,495
又是你 福尔摩斯
You again, Holmes.

589
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:11,357
要是你有什么要对我的新娘说的
If you have something to say to my bride,

590
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:14,320
在我把你踢出去之前赶紧说吧
speak out before I kick you out.

591
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:18,884
不 我正在等福尔摩斯先生呢 让我们单独谈谈
No, I have been expecting Mr. Holmes, leave us.

592
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,395
我不打算让你跟这个...
I have no intention of leaving you with this...

593
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:23,238
去吧 James
Go, James.

594
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,186
走啊
Go.

595
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,296
我很意外 你竟拖了这么久才来
I'm only surprised it took you so long.

596
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:36,371
我意外的是 你竟然以为子弹就可以恐吓我
I am surprised that you thought bullies could frighten me.

597
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,209
要是危险对我没有吸引力的话
No man would take up my profession

598
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,745
我也不会干这一行
if danger did not attract him.

599
00:43:00,395 --> 00:43:01,714
您是一位绅士
You're a gentleman,

600
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,167
我会把您当朋友的
I will treat you as my friend.

601
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:07,139
我可无法保证会对此作出回报
I cannot promise to reciprocate.

602
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,058
毫无疑问
No doubt it was foolish

603
00:43:11,096 --> 00:43:14,036
威胁您这么勇敢的一个人是很蠢的
to threaten such a brave man as yourself.

604
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:15,519
不 蠢的是
No, what was really foolish

605
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,184
像您这么一位聪明的女士
for an intelligent woman like you

606
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,450
竟然会让自己跟一群流氓掺和在一起
is to place yourself in the power

607
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,857
他们可是擅于勒索 也许还会出卖您
of a band of rascals who could blackmail, or give you away.

608
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,613
不不 我可不是这么头脑简单的人
No, no, I'm not so simple.

609
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,586
他们当中
None of them have the least idea

610
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,833
没人知道是谁雇佣了他们
who their employer is.

611
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,865
Barney Stockdale和他的妻子也不知道?
Not Barney Stockdale and his wife?

612
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,010
他们都是很好的猎犬
They are good hounds,

613
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,578
能够保守秘密
who run silent.

614
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:43,216
还愿意为你去坐牢吗?
And are prepared to go to prison for you?

615
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,671
他们安之若素
They take what comes,

616
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,457
他们拿了钱就该这样做
that's what they're paid for.

617
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:57,201
而Haines Johnson先生 噢 当然了 这不是他的真名
And Mr. Haines- Johnson oh surely that is not his name,

618
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,807
他拿了钱又该干什么事?
what is he paid for?

619
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:05,830
Miguel 他对我就像兄弟一样亲
Miguel, he's like a brother to me.

620
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:10,361
至于其他人嘛 他们都是干活的
As for the others they work

621
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,591
而在这件事中我从来没有露过面
and I do not appear in the matter.

622
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,629
除非我把你牵扯进去
Unless I bring you into it.

623
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,967
可您是位绅士 福尔摩斯先生
But you're a gentleman, Mr. Holmes,

624
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,120
您会尊重一位女士的隐私
you respect a woman's secret.

625
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:26,667
哼 谋杀也是隐私吗?
Huh, is murder a woman's secret?

626
00:44:31,223 --> 00:44:32,345
谋杀?
Murder?

627
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:37,133
我的脸上淌着血
My face bled,

628
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,801
那些无情的殴打
my stomach burned,

629
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:42,521
打得他的腹中好像火烧一般
from the savage blows

630
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:44,629
可是比起我滴血的心 那不算什么
but it was nothing to the bleeding of my heart,

631
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,288
第245页
page 245.

632
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,004
还有一位目击证人 Klein夫人
And there's a witness, Mrs. Klein,

633
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,979
就是职业拳手Steve Dixie
the prizefighter Steve Dixie

634
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:59,728
他将指证你
who will testify against you.

635
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:04,547
这些你都告诉我未来的婆婆了吗?
And all this, you told my future mother-in-law?

636
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,880
我跟她说了什么并不重要
What, I told the Dowager is of no importance

637
00:45:06,918 --> 00:45:09,884
因为她无法阻止你跟她儿子的婚姻
since she cannot prevent your marriage to her son.

638
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,866
是的 她是没有办法
No, she cannot.

639
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,568
而你觉得你可以吗?
And you believe that you can.

640
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:16,364
是的
Oh, yes.

641
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,183
你为什么要这样做呢?
Why should you wish to?

642
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:24,980
是因为我是个外国人吗?
Is it because I'm a foreigner?

643
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:31,098
你也像那些英国佬一样 是个势利鬼吗 福尔摩斯先生?
Are you an English snob, Mr. Holmes?

644
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,319
我来告诉你吧
Let me tell you,

645
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,141
我们的人几代都是
my people have been leaders in Pernambuco

646
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,262
Pernambuco的领袖
for generations.

647
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,849
夫人
Madam,

648
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:47,103
你是Andalusia 一位吉普赛人的私生子
you are the bastard child of a gypsy in Andalusia.

649
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,102
你这婊子养的!
<i>Hijo de puta!</i>

650
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:57,953
是谁告诉你的?
Who told you?

651
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:01,045
是我交换来的
It is my trade.

652
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,527
你必须把手稿给我
Now you must give me the manuscript.

653
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:13,065
不 不 不
No, no, no.

654
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:18,339
你想得到纸袋里的灰烬吗?
Do you wish for ashes in a paper bag?

655
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,157
你对我太苛刻了
You are hard to me,

656
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,229
看着我的眼睛
look at it with my eyes.

657
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,682
一生的抱负就要被你毁了
A life's ambition about to be ruined.

658
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,037
那是你的原罪
The original sin was yours.

659
00:46:33,075 --> 00:46:35,364
是的 我认识Douglas
Yes, I know Douglas.

660
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:38,143
是的 我真的爱他
Yes, I did love him truly.

661
00:46:38,878 --> 00:46:42,050
是的 我确实爱过一阵子
Yes, yes, I did for a while,

662
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,789
以我的方式爱着他
in my fashion.

663
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,899
可是他要的是婚姻
But he wanted marriage,

664
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,931
这是他唯一想要的
nothing less would serve him.

665
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,774
但这个并不符合我的计划
It did not fit with my plans.

666
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:54,958
于是你就雇了些流氓殴打他
And so you hired ruffians to beat him

667
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:57,301
直到他在你的窗下奄奄一息
until he was nearly dead under your own window,

668
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,065
难道这能算是淑女的所为吗?
is that the act of a lady?

669
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,759
没错 Barney跟那些男孩
Yes, it is true Barney and the boys

670
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:05,014
赶他走的时候也许是有些粗野
drove him away perhaps a little too roughly.

671
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,788
可他之后干了什么?
What did he do then,

672
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:11,887
他写了本书
he wrote a book.

673
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:14,883
对我进行恶毒地人身攻击
A vicious personal attack.

674
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,589
那能算是绅士的所为吗?
Is that the act of a gentleman?

675
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:23,292
你知道他的出版商并没有收到这本书?
You knew his publisher had not received it?

676
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:24,101
是的
Yes.

677
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:27,425
那它就应该还在他奶奶的房子里
So it had to be in the house of his grandmother.

678
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,198
只要这本书存在
As long as that book existed

679
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,905
我就不可能安全
there was no safety for me.

680
00:47:35,158 --> 00:47:38,190
我想诚心地做这件事
I wanted to do this thing honestly.

681
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:43,292
我接受了她开出的任何价格
I offered any price she cared to ask

682
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:46,052
可她不接受
but she wouldn't take it.

683
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,644
难道保护自己也要受到谴责吗?
Are we to be blamed for protecting ourselves?

684
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,354
有一件事让我感兴趣
One thing intrigues me,

685
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:03,075
为什么像你这么一位
why a woman as lovely as you

686
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:07,343
能把男人掌握于股掌之中的美丽女士
who wields such power over men

687
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:13,166
也需要别人的保护呢?
needs the protection of anyone?

688
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:21,518
现实才不在乎我们
Nature doesn't give a damn for any of us.

689
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:26,757
我爱James
I love James,

690
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:29,135
我想要他
and I want him.

691
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:32,643
他代表着
He represents,

692
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,164
我想要的一切
all I've ever desired

693
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,125
这是我获得某种安全感的
and my one chance

694
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:42,468
一个机会
of a kind of security,

695
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,659
这种安全感 我称之为幸福
which I call happiness

696
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:51,319
而你却要把它从我这儿夺走
and you would take it away from me.

697
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:55,214
为什么?
Why?

698
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,249
为什么?
Why?

699
00:49:04,962 --> 00:49:06,206
为什么?
Why?

700
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,252
因为你是男人的毁灭者
Because you are a destroyer of men.

701
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,262
噢 是的
Oh yes.

702
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:14,488
你毁掉了Douglas Maberley
You destroyed Douglas Maberley

703
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:18,937
还差点毁掉了我的朋友约翰 华生
and very nearly my friend John Watson

704
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,142
用你那种为了自身的利益...
with the ruthless disregard

705
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:24,728
...而不顾一切的漠然
for anything but your own selfish interest.

706
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:27,368
为什么在你这儿就不成功了呢?
Why have I failed with you?

707
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,779
我的要求只有这个...
I require only this

708
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:35,617
我要读到你跟Lomond公爵解除婚约的消息
that I read of the breaking of your engagement to the Duke of Lomond

709
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:37,498
在星期四早上之前
by Thursday morning.

710
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,455
要是我不答应呢?
And if I refuse?

711
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:41,726
苏格兰场
Scotland Yard,

712
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:44,993
会展开对证人的全面调查
a full investigation with witnesses.

713
00:49:46,262 --> 00:49:48,056
我听你发落
I'm at your mercy,

714
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,809
你这个混蛋
<i>Haz de me lopeor</i>

715
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:51,352
悉听尊便
Do your worst.

716
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:56,220
噢 坐头等舱去环游世界
Oh, how much does it cost to go around the world

717
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:57,609
要多少钱呢?
in first class style?

718
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,510
我算算
Let me see, yes,

719
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:03,205
你写一张5000英镑的支票 给Maberley太太
you will send a check for 5,000 pounds to Mrs. Maberley

720
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:06,078
这是你欠她的
you owe her a little change of that.

721
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,926
再见 Klein夫人
Goodbye, Mrs. Klein.

722
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:13,337
我毫不怀疑 有一天我会再见到
I have no doubt I shall see you again one day,

723
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:16,407
你在一个国王的怀抱里
on the arm of a king.

724
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:21,971
于是Klein夫人 著名的美人儿
And therefore the celebrated beauty Mrs. Klein

725
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:24,091
离开前往西班牙
has departed for Spain.

726
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,627
她的家族几代都是
Her people have been leaders in Pernambuco

727
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:30,431
Pernambuco的领袖
for generations.

728
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,950
这是一篇有品位的报道
Well, it's a dignified report

729
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,420
不知道其他人会怎么评价它
I wonder what others would have made of it.

730
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:59,104
你让她脱罪了 福尔摩斯
You let her off the hook, Holmes.

731
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,036
你是说她犯了重罪吗?
Compounding a felony, you mean?

732
00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:03,705
谋杀
Murder.

733
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,600
本来就是不可能证实的
It would have been impossible to prove.

734
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:10,722
Klein夫人已经明白了
Mrs. Klein has learned,

735
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,183
一个道理
that you can't play with edged tools forever

736
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,908
那就是
without cutting those,

737
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:20,125
"玩火者必自焚"
aging hands of hers.

738
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:24,980
岁月不饶人
Time is not on her side.

739
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:27,109
我们走吧
Shall we?

740
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:32,955
