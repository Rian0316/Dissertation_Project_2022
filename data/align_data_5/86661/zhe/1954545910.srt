1
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:21,126

2
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:31,160

3
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:42,910

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,575

5
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,054

6
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:01,114
你可以去通知皇家学会的秘书
You may inform the Secretary of the Royal Society

7
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,008
我讲座的题目是
that I have entitled my lecture

8
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:08,979
"达尔文的根本性错误"
Darwin's Fundamental Error.

9
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:11,223
这会引发不少抗议的 先生
That'll raise a few hackles, sir.

10
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,011
可不是嘛
Will it not?

11
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,303
我得走了
I must be off.

12
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:19,607
这些人都要通知到
You can acknowledge all of these.

13
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,628
这家伙不错
There's a good chap.

14
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,023
谢谢
Thanks.

15
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:23,923
父亲
Father?

16
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:25,224
亲爱的 什么事
My dear?

17
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,817
昨晚你听到Roy的叫声了么
Did you hear how Roy barked last night?

18
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,835
太可怕了
It was dreadful.

19
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:31,414
不 我没有听见
No, no I didn't.

20
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:33,245
你听见了么 Bennett
Did you hear him Bennett?

21
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,954
我也没有 先生
I can't say I did, sir.

22
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,706
它不停地叫
He kept on and on.

23
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:39,306
还在咆哮
He howled too.

24
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,800
肯定是有人进了花园
I'm sure someone got into the garden.

25
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:43,509
有人闯入?
An intruder?

26
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:46,145
是的 因为
Well yes, because.

27
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,197
哦 父亲
Oh father

28
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,901
有人从窗户外
someone looked in at me,

29
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:52,428
看着我
at my window.

30
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,947
不可能
Impossible.

31
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,948
你是在做梦吧
You must have been dreaming.

32
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:01,726
Edith 没人能爬到你的窗口
Oh, Edith nobody could reach your window.

33
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:04,093
窗户离地面太远了
It's far too far off the ground.

34
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,067
我肯定不是在做梦
I'm sure I wasn't dreaming.

35
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,642
Bennett 你来负责
Bennett, you take charge

36
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,735
不然我就赶不上参加教工会议了
or I shall be late for the faculty meeting.

37
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:14,217
我让你的未婚夫来照顾你 亲爱的
I leave you in your fiance's care my dear.

38
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,034
如果他做你的丈夫
If he proves as good a husband to you as

39
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,348
也能像做我的助理那么出色
he has amanuenses to me,

40
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:19,324
你就是个幸运的女人
you'll be a fortunate woman.

41
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,380
缓和一下她的恐惧情绪 Bennett 我知道你能做到
Allay her fears Bennett. I know you can.

42
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,264
你相信我么
Can you believe me?

43
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:27,100
没法轻易相信啊
Not easily, no.

44
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,599
就像你父亲说的
I mean as your father said.

45
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:29,943
那你就来看看
Come and look.

46
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,431
我实在是太忙了 这些关于松鼠猴的笔记要打印
I'm awfully busy with these notes on Saimiri Sciureus to type,

47
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,599
然后是你父亲关于论证...
and then the proof of your father's...

48
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:38,989
Jack 我不是在做梦
Jack, I know I wasn't dreaming

49
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:42,262
你知道Roy不会无缘无故乱叫
and you know Roy doesn't bark at nothing.

50
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,988
我希望你亲自去看看
I want you to see for yourself.

51
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,547
你必须来看看 求你了
You must. Please.

52
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,937
在狗叫声吵醒我之后
And then after the barking woke me

53
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:53,022
我听到了别的声音 从那下面传来的
I heard another sound from just below here.

54
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,624
从那下面?
From below?

55
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,797
这 还有那 看到了么
There and there, do you see?

56
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,438
常春藤被拉开了
The ivy's pulled away.

57
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:00,935
我肯定是吓晕了
I must have fainted.

58
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,111
醒来时天已经亮了
The next thing I knew it was dawn.

59
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,927
你能肯定你不是在做梦 Edith?
You're quite, quite certain you didn't dream this, Edith?

60
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,346
我肯定
Quite.

61
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:20,641
Jack 我要你全心全意地相信我
Jack, I insist you believe me.

62
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,458
好吧
Very well.

63
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,760
我要你去把这些事告诉福尔摩斯
And that you inform Sherlock Holmes of the facts.

64
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,035
噢 亲爱的
Oh, darling.

65
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:30,556
不然我就要重新考虑我们的婚事
Or I shall reconsider our engagement.

66
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,382
为什么
But why?

67
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:37,930
我不能和一个不相信我的人 携手共度此生
I could not give my hand to a man who doubts my word.

68
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:39,500
<i>华生 如方便请前来</i>
<i>Watson, come at once if convenient.</i>

69
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,149
<i>不方便亦来</i>
<i>If inconvenient come all the same.</i>

70
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:52,374
福尔摩斯 我收到了你的便条
Holmes, I got your note

71
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,598
是不方便
and it is inconvenient,

72
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:55,931
确实不方便
damned inconvenient.

73
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:57,889
你的旧伤又在困扰你了
Your old wound is troubling you.

74
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,384
没有的事
No.

75
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,076
我看未必
I prefer to differ.

76
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:02,616
你上楼时脚步不稳
Your step was uneven on the stairs.

77
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:04,684
我做了一天的手术 福尔摩斯
I have a full surgery Holmes.

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,723
你得原谅  我有点走神
You must excuse a certain abstraction of mind, Watson.

79
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:09,637
我知道
I see.

80
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,481
这件事很复杂
It's a tangled scheme.

81
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,389
我正努力找出头绪
I've been looking for the loose end which might unravel it.

82
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,231
以便解决它
One such might reside in the question,

83
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:24,367
问题的关键在于到底Presbury教授的女儿 是清醒的还是在做梦
does Professor Presbury's daughter wake or dream.

84
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,904
你把我叫来 就为这么个事儿?
I'm summoned here for no more than this?

85
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,820
你肯定听说过Presbury?
You've heard of Presbury?

86
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,300
当然 谁没听说过呢?
Of course, who hasn't?

87
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,518
我们最著名的自然科学家
He's our most distinguished natural scientist.

88
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,450
他是个鳏夫 有一个女儿
He's a widower with one daughter.

89
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:43,338
他女儿坚持说 夜里有人在她窗边出现
She insists someone appeared at her window last night.

90
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,935
Presbury小姐的卧室在三楼
Ms. Presbury's bedroom is on the second floor

91
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:53,894
即使是最敏捷的飞贼也没法爬上去
and is completely inaccessible to even the most agile cat burglar.

92
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,060
读一读这个
Read this.

93
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,547
是一点钟的邮车送来的
It arrived by the 1:00 post.

94
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:04,855
写信的人已经提前来了
The author already arrives ahead of his time,

95
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,943
真是个非常性急的年轻人
a most precipitant young man.

96
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:09,336
Bennett先生 这是我的朋友和同事华生
Mr. Bennett, my friend and colleague Dr. Watson.

97
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,176
您好
How do you do?

98
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:10,998
Bennett先生
Mr. Bennett.

99
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:11,726
请坐
Please sit down.

100
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,211
不 请原谅
No, forgive me.

101
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:16,848
福尔摩斯先生 恐怕我的判断严重有误
Mr. Holmes, I fear I've made a grave error of judgment.

102
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,700
我本来是不该来找您的
I should not have been in touch with you at all.

103
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,597
我是在浪费你的时间
I've wasted your time entirely.

104
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,575
没有什么合理的理由 能解释Presbury小姐的恐惧
It is not a rational reason for Ms. Presbury's fears.

105
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,108
是的 是无法解释
No, no I can't say that.

106
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:29,135
这事很微妙
Well it's, it's a delicate matter but I,

107
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,237
我必须请求您不要再继续了
I must beg you to proceed no further.

108
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,392
当然 我会补偿你的
I can of course recompense you.

109
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,545
Bennett先生 你在信里有所隐瞒
Mr. Bennett, your letter was less than frank,

110
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:41,906
是不是?
was it not?

111
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,275
我说出了全部事实
I set out the facts.

112
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,542
我怀疑不是全部
Not all I suspect.

113
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,868
或许是出于对未婚妻Presbury小姐的忠诚?
Probably out of loyalty to your fiance, Ms. Presbury?

114
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,831
您听说过她?
You're aware of her?

115
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:54,645
当然 我还听说 你的雇主跟Alice Morphy小姐订了婚
As I am of your employer's engagement to Ms. Alice Morphy,

116
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,750
她可是著名解剖学家的女儿啊
the daughter of the famous comparative anatomist.

117
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,425
她与Presburys家是邻居 是么?
She resides next door to the Presburys, does she not?

118
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,335
你怎么知道他们订婚了?
How do you know of the engagement?

119
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:06,430
婚讯就登在泰晤士报上 分别是七月一日和九月五日
The Times, July the 1st, September the 5th respectively.

120
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:11,269
福尔摩斯先生可以说是过目不忘
Mr. Holmes' memory is of a photographical order.

121
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,431
确实是这样
Quite so.

122
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:15,166
哦 天哪
Oh, dear.

123
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:19,184
Bennett 我了解你的窘境
Mr. Bennett, I do appreciate your predicament.

124
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,567
作为一个科学家 一个理性主义者
As a scientist and a rationalist yourself

125
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,311
你不愿意采纳
I dare say you're reluctant to accept the evidence

126
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:26,183
Presbury小姐所坚持的证据
insisted upon by Ms. Presbury.

127
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,684
况且 作为她父亲信任的助手
Further, as a father's trusted assistant

128
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:31,420
向我求助也陷你于不忠
to have recourse to me must smack to you of disloyalty.

129
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:32,587
一点不错
Exactly.

130
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,222
我是这个家庭的一份子
I'm part of the family except that Edith,

131
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:38,091
除非Presbury小姐因为不安而...
Ms. Presbury, she was so upset that she,

132
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:41,142
Bennett先生 你更愿意疏远谁呢
Mr. Bennett, who would you prefer to alienate,

133
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,652
你未来的妻子还是她那著名的父亲?
your perspective wife or her celebrated father?

134
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,533
你让我陷入两难 都不是
You give me a choice of evils, neither.

135
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,118
那就多告诉我一些事实
Then furnish me with the facts

136
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,130
看我能不能帮助你
and I will see how I can help you.

137
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,710
你可以依赖我们两个的判断力
You may rely on the discretion of both of us.

138
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,873
好吧
Well.

139
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,426
比如说 你会不会把Presbury小姐
Would you for example describe Ms. Presbury,

140
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:04,240
描述成一个敏感爱幻想的女孩?
as an impressionable, fanciful girl?

141
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,475
不 恰恰相反
No, quite the reverse.

142
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,359
那么Alice Morphy小姐呢
Ms. Alice Morphy?

143
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,633
或许Presbury教授和她订婚
Perhaps Professor Presbury's engagement to her

144
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,721
让你感到意外
came to you as something of a surprise.

145
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:17,473
毕竟他的年龄是她的三倍
He is after all three times her age.

146
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,441
选这件天鹅绒的?
And this velour?

147
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,869
我更中意
I prefer that one,

148
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,749
带白色羽毛的那一件
with the osprey feathers.

149
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,344
你能去问问他么
Could you ask him, do you think?

150
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,458
我父亲对他的兰花最自豪了
Father's extremely proud of his orchids.

151
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,418
我讨厌它们
I hate them.

152
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,195
它们是那么的
They're so,

153
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:41,278
怎么说呢 那么的不纯洁
oh I don't know, so impure somehow.

154
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,395
你去跟他说别再送兰花了 好么
Do please ask him not to send them anymore.

155
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,813
我就你这么一个好朋友了 求求你
There's a sweet friend, Edith, please?

156
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,916
-你自己不能去说么 -不
-Can you not ask him? -I couldn't.

157
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,408
我不敢 我很懦弱的
I dare not. I'm such a coward.

158
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,777
-恩 -求求你了
-Well. -Oh, please?

159
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:57,308
你比我要有个性的多
You've got so much more character than me.

160
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,677
跟他一样有很强的个性
You're as strong as he.

161
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,479
可是Alice
But Alice,

162
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:03,439
如果你连这个都不敢对我父亲说
if you dare not ask this of my father

163
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,041
那结婚以后 你怎么去处理那些
how will you ever manage those deeper conflicts

164
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,326
即使是最幸福的婚姻中也会存在的冲突呢
that occur even in the happiest of marriages?

165
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,762
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

166
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,659
我很害怕
I'm so frightened.

167
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,285
害怕和我父亲结婚?
Of marrying my father?

168
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,018
我想是的
I wish,

169
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,026
请别再问了
no, please don't ask.

170
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,051
我们别再谈这个了
Let's not speak of it.

171
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:29,048
你觉得这个怎么样?
What do you think of this one?

172
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,581
不论是Presbury小姐还是我 都认为她父亲对Morphy小姐的迷恋
Neither Ms. Presbury nor I consider her father's infatuation with Ms. Morphy to be

173
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:36,318
总的说来不是很合适
... entirely appropriate.

174
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,107
有点极端
Rather excessive.

175
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,795
她的父母 对这门亲事也没有反对吗?
And her parents have no objections to the marriage?

176
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:44,198
教授是个受人尊敬的鳏夫
The professor is a respectable widower.

177
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,584
而且还很富有
And a wealthy man.

178
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:53,389
我什么时候能去拜访?
When may I call?

179
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:54,952
拜访?
Call?

180
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,361
去查看Presbury小姐的窗口
To view Ms. Presbury's window,

181
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,684
亲自去判断
to determine for myself its accessibility

182
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,884
是否存在有人闯入的可能
and otherwise to an intruder.

183
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,661
明天早上11点可以么?
Shall we say 11:00 tomorrow morning?

184
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,455
教授那时会在学校里
Professor Presbury will be at his college.

185
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:05,135
那就没有问题了
That's of no matter.

186
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,612
我的请求完全合理
At present my inquiries are purely logistical.

187
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,947
我对教授从没有什么隐瞒的
I have never had any secrets from the professor.

188
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,396
Bennett先生
Mr. Bennett,

189
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,024
让我提醒你
let me refer you to your first question,

190
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,809
你事实上已经回答了我的第一个问题
which you have in fact answered.

191
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:20,044
比起你的雇主
You're more inclined to Ms. Presbury's party

192
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,946
你更倾向于Presbury小姐一方
than you are to your employer's.

193
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,372
是的 我想是这样
Yes, yes, I dare say.

194
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,657
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,965
再见
Good day.

196
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,284
再见
Good day.

197
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:46,027
福尔摩斯 你这是在刺探 一个受人尊敬的家庭的家务事
Holmes, you're prying into the affairs of a perfectly respectable family.

198
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,543
为什么Bennett这么不情愿说出实情?
Why is Bennett so reluctant to tell the truth?

199
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,364
忠诚
Loyalty.

200
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,859
这是显而易见的
It is as plain as a pack staff.

201
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,160
但愿如此
Let us hope so.

202
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,200
但他却是被迫写信给我的
Yet he wrote to me under duress.

203
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,620
你注意到他的笔迹了么
You notice his handwriting,

204
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,864
字母T下笔很重
the crossing of the T's with such deep indentation?

205
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,258
还有他刚来的时候 努力要取消这件事
And then upon his arrival his endeavors to call the whole thing off, 

206
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,040
不 这件事可不是看上去的这么简单
no, there's more to this than meets the eye.

207
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:04,841
我不同意
I do not agree.

208
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:07,960
杀鸡焉用宰牛刀
This case is unworthy of you.

209
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,514
我得回诊所去了
I must return to my surgery.

210
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,705
或许明天再见喽
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.

211
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,154
父亲
Father?

212
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,660
亲爱的
My dear.

213
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,199
我想你昨晚睡得好点了吧?
I trust you slept better?

214
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:01,169
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

215
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:03,616
昨晚我搬到客房去睡了
Last night I moved to the guest bedroom.

216
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:05,525
没这个必要
Oh, no need surely.

217
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:08,178
那只是场噩梦
It was but an ugly dream.

218
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,056
父亲 Alice要我...
Father, Alice has asked me,

219
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:13,970
什么?
Yes?

220
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:18,064
实际上她根本不喜欢兰花
The truth is she does not care for orchids.

221
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,552
她不喜欢?
She doesn't?

222
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,537
那她为什么不说呢
Well, why did she not say so?

223
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,481
她不敢说
Well, she was afraid to.

224
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:31,050
您不知道您是多么令人畏惧
You forget how formidable you are father.

225
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,222
傻女孩
The silly girl.

226
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:37,032
那她会收到玫瑰的
Well, then she shall have roses.

227
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,576
两打红玫瑰
Yes, two dozen red roses.

228
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,420
Roy昨晚很安静
Roy was quiet enough last night.

229
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,903
别激怒它 先生
Not to rouse him, sir.

230
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,546
它本来很温顺的
Docility itself, (unintelligible).

231
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:58,157
好吧
All right,

232
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:01,385
它会适应这些锁链的
He's grown accustomed to his shackles.

233
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,511
可怜的家伙
The poor beast.

234
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:14,036
我们可以上去么
Shall we go up?

235
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,120
如果Presbury小姐不反对的话
If Ms. Presbury has no objection.

236
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,139
我明白必须这么做
I understand the necessity.

237
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,531
我们来带路吧 亲爱的
Let us lead the way my dear.

238
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,829
我很高兴你今天恢复正常了 华生
I'm glad you're more yourself today, Watson.

239
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,511
你昨天简直像是头熊
You were a veritable bear yesterday.

240
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:32,215
或许有点脾气不好
A touch liverish perhaps.

241
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,486
就是这出现了人影?
This is where the figure appeared?

242
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:39,563
是的
Yes.

243
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,004
没有什么梯子
There's no ladder on the premises

244
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,622
能伸到这个高度吧
that could reach this height?

245
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,641
没有
No.

246
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,821
窗子是半开着的?
Was the window ajar?

247
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,468
是的 我把门锁了
Yes, I keep the door locked.

248
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,479
他的手碰到窗玻璃了么?
Did the hand touch the windowpane?

249
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:53,921
我不知道
I don't know.

250
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,527
我晕过去了
I fainted.

251
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,954
你当然会的 当然
Of course you did, of course you did.

252
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,451
这是令人生畏的高度
Well, that's a formidable elevation,

253
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:11,357
尽管常春藤很牢固
yet the ivy's strong, Hedera Helixis,

254
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,617
但在那还是给扯断了
torn away just here.

255
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:21,670
Presbury小姐 你父亲提前回来了
Ms. Presbury, your father has returned prematurely.

256
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,438
哦 不
Oh, no.

257
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,144
不能让他知道你在这里 福尔摩斯先生
He mustn't know you're here Mr. Holmes.

258
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,030
这没法避免
That can scarcely be avoided.

259
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,929
不管怎么说 我们先下去吧
However, let us go down.

260
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,325
从后楼梯?
The backstairs?

261
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:30,888
当然不是
Certainly not.

262
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:40,460
Bennett 你是怎么准备我的讲座的?
Bennett, what did you do with my lecture?

263
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,781
你到底是谁 先生?
Who the devil are you, sir?

264
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,690
父亲 对不起
Father, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,470
这是歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

266
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,289
谁?
Who?

267
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:52,343
著名侦探
The detective.

268
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,127
Presbury教授
Professor Presbury,

269
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,754
我的名片
my card.

270
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:05,310
221 B
221 B,

271
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:08,813
这么个地址很难激起别人的信任
hardly an address to inspire confidence.

272
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:12,027
我从没想过要激起别人的信任
I have never sought to inspire confidence in others.

273
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,220
我对自己倒是信心十足
I have quite enough of my own.

274
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,941
我来介绍我的同事 华生医生
May I introduce my colleague Dr. Watson?

275
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,031
不必了 你们俩都可以马上离开
Certainly not, you may leave at once the pair of you.

276
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,546
父亲 他们是我们请来的客人
Father, they are here at our request.

277
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:21,597
我可没有请他们 Edith
But not mine, Edith.

278
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,258
至于你 Bennett
And you Bennett,

279
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,547
在你寻求用这种解决方式前应该和我商量
you should have consulted me before resorting to such methods,

280
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:30,793
一个平庸的侦探和他的同伙
a common detective and his accomplice, really.

281
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,193
现在 先生们
Now, sir,

282
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,661
我来护送你们从这里出去
allow me to escort you from the premises.

283
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,925
我的助手没有权力雇佣你处理这件事
My assistant had no authority to engage you in this matter.

284
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,618
别再调查它了
Kindly inquire into it no further.

285
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:42,874
不然的话我会
Should you persist I shall have no hesitation

286
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,500
毫不犹豫的叫警察的
in calling the police.

287
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:46,461
我和苏格兰场的Lestrade可很熟 所以你最好小心点
Lestrade of Yard is well known to me so beware.

288
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,827
去找Lestrade嘛 我可是会犹疑的 教授
I would hesitate in calling Lestrade, professor,

289
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,010
如果你希望解开这个谜的话
if you wish to have the mystery solved.

290
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:54,276
压根就没有什么谜 先生 没有
There is no mystery, sir, none.

291
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,793
现在你们可以走了
Now be gone with you

292
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,160
否则我就要放狗了
or would you have me release my dog?

293
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,905
它可分不清
Believe me he'll not distinguish

294
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:03,832
谁是雇来的私家侦探 谁是入侵者
between a hired snoop and an intruder.

295
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,690
你们还不走吗 先生们?
Will you be gone, sir, will you?

296
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,551
我们会走的 你也别太过分了
We shall, sir, we shall but you are over the mark.

297
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,430
说话要小心点
Kindly watch your words.

298
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,976
这个品种的狗
As a breed,

299
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:14,622
虽然外表很凶猛
despite their ferocious appearance

300
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,598
实际上举止却并不凶猛
these dogs are seldom vicious.

301
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:20,976
我很奇怪Roy为什么要整天拴着
I'm surprised that Roy needs chaining at all

302
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:24,201
除非是为了你的安全吧
unless it is for your safety as much as ours.

303
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:06,582
华生 狗能反映一个家庭的生活
The dog reflects family life Watson.

304
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,916
真的么
Does it indeed.

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
谁听说过在阴郁的家庭里有只欢闹的狗
Whoever heard of a frisky dog in a gloomy home

306
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,580
或是在欢乐的家里有只悲伤的狗?
or a sad dog in a happy one?

307
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,465
易怒的人养着易怒的狗
Snarling people have snarling dogs.

308
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:23,586
你像我一样注意到了 Presbury家的爱尔兰猎狗
You observed the Presbury's Irish wolfhound as well as I.

309
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,684
它对它的主人咆哮着
He growled quite as much at his master as it did at us,

310
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,447
就像对待我们两个陌生人一样
two complete strangers.

311
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:30,761
这动物毫不掩饰它对教授的敌意
That animal did not reserve its animosity solely for the professor.

312
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,096
等一会Bennett来了 我们会从他那确认这一点的
We'll seek verification from young Bennett when he arrives.

313
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,927
我们在"山羊罗盘"酒馆会面后
I sent word by way of Jack Macphail

314
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:39,421
我顺道给Jack Macphail捎了信
after our meeting at the Goat and Compasses.

315
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,743
你的另一个密探么 福尔摩斯?
Another of your agents Holmes?

316
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,692
是Presbury家的马车夫
The Presburys' coachman.

317
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:45,818
他负责看管Roy
He has charge of Roy.

318
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:50,179
我昨晚跟他一起去找了个小小的乐子
I joined him last night for what he calls a wee Goldie.

319
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:51,893
Bennett来了 还是那么风风火火
Here's Bennett, precipitous as ever.

320
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,019
请进
Come in.

321
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:55,717
早上好
Good morning.

322
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,195
福尔摩斯先生 华生医生
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,

323
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:04,027
我必须为昨天的会面道歉
I must apologize for your unfortunate encounter yesterday.

324
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,522
-但同时... -没必要
-But also... -There's no need.

325
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
事实上 恰好给这件怪事
In fact, it has provided the very first clue

326
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:09,707
提供了第一个线索
to this odd affair.

327
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:11,145
请坐
Do sit down.

328
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,503
谢谢
Thank you.

329
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,198
福尔摩斯先生 我不能装作
Mr. Holmes, I cannot pretend that I am happy

330
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:16,901
接到你的邀请时很高兴
to have answered your summons.

331
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:20,320
当然 我仍然欣赏你
Of course and I continue to appreciate

332
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:21,749
那分裂的忠诚
the division of your loyalties.

333
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,987
所以你有些事情没有坦诚以告也不足为奇
It's no small wonder that you've withheld so much.

334
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:32,359
Roy第一次袭击它的主人
Roy first attacked his master on the evening

335
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,411
是在九月二日的晚上 是么?
of September the 2nd, did he not?

336
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:35,715
你是怎么知道的?
How can you know that?

337
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:37,851
就在教授从书房去到门厅的时候
As the professor came from his study into the hall

338
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,602
在这种情况下
he restrained the dog.

339
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,375
他拴住狗 把它关在储藏室里
On this occasion he was merely shut up in the scullery.

340
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:44,277
第二天早晨又一切正常了
The next morning he was as right as rain

341
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,083
这都是Macphail告诉我的
or so Macphail informs me.

342
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:47,895
Macphail?
Macphail?

343
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:48,974
还有谁能比家里的马车夫
Who better than the family coachman

344
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:52,601
更能告诉我实情呢?
to advise me how matters might truly stand?

345
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,871
请原谅 福尔摩斯先生 我应该亲自告诉你这些 但是...
Forgive me Mr. Holmes, I should have told you myself but...

346
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,163
但是你没有
But you didn't.

347
00:20:58,615 --> 00:21:01,454
第二次袭击是在13天后
The second attack occurred 13 days later.

348
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,402
同样 教授是在门厅里
Again, the professor was in the hall.

349
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,440
幸运的是 这一次他关上了书房的门
Fortunately this time he was able to put the study door between himself

350
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,486
挡住了狗 是不是这样?
and the altered animal, was he not?

351
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:11,045
就是从那会起 Edith希望把Roy锁起来
Edith wanted Roy chained from that moment.

352
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:13,005
但她父亲不同意
But her father overruled her.

353
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:16,257
他坚持说它还是条可爱温柔的狗
He insisted that he was still a dear affectionate dog,

354
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:18,041
本性上不会伤人
that he wasn't congenitally vicious.

355
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,918
那在第三次袭击后呢?
But not after the third attack?

356
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:23,761
不 他再没有这么说 而是把狗栓了起来
No, he did agree then that he had to be restrained.

357
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,150
然后Roy就被这么被锁在马房里了?
And Roy was banished to the chain in the stable yard.

358
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:28,414
是的
Yes.

359
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,723
Macphail认为Roy行为的变化
Macphail believes that the change in Roy's behavior

360
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,832
大约是两个月前出现的
stems from about two months ago?

361
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:34,459
我想或许是的
I think it may have.

362
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:36,238
我没有特别注意
I, I didn't keep a straight note of it.

363
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,461
去问问你的未婚妻 还有Macphail
Consult your fiance Bennett and Macphail.

364
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,095
关于这件事 有必要做一个
A precise log of these events

365
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,592
确切的记录
may yet prove pertinent.

366
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,655
我注意到教授今天下午
I observed that the professor lectures

367
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,316
两点钟在大学里有个讲座
at the university at 2:00 this afternoon.

368
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:47,925
到时我会到家里去
I shall call then.

369
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:51,402
不 我不同意
No, I couldn't possibly agree, no.

370
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:55,206
Bennett  Presbury小姐不是在做梦
Bennett, Ms. Presbury did not dream.

371
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:58,426
是有什么人或什么东西探访了她
Someone or something looked in upon her.

372
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:02,648
我相信你的未婚妻处境极为危险
It is my conviction that your fiance is in grave danger.

373
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,732
来自谁?
From who?

374
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:10,137
不 先生 应该说是来自什么东西
No, sir, from whom or from what.

375
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:19,384
作为秘书 你负责处理教授的通信
As secretary you handle the professor's correspondence.

376
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,321
是的 我的职责是是拆阅每一封信
Oh yes, it's my responsibility to open every letter.

377
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,996
Presbury小姐一直习惯于
Has it always been Ms. Presbury's habit

378
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,149
每天晚上锁上卧室的门么
to lock her bedroom door at night?

379
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,212
呃 不
Um, no, well it,

380
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,968
她告诉我...
well she told me that...

381
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,574
什么?
Yes?

382
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,754
那是在Roy举止怪异之后
It was after Roy began to behave so strangely.

383
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,502
她也开始害怕狗了么
That she too became afraid of the dog?

384
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,241
福尔摩斯先生 你不能碰他的书桌
Mr. Holmes, you mustn't touch his desk.

385
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:44,392
Bennett!

386
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:46,994
谢谢
Thank you.

387
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,472
告诉我教授和这个叫

不
No, no, no,

391

商业街 当然(头字母为CC)
Commercial Road of course CC.

392
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:23,903
似乎教授本人
It would appear that the professor answers

393
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:26,631
亲自回复此人的信件
such correspondence himself.

394
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:28,660
嗯 又是...
Well, again...

395
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,869
又是吞吞吐吐的了
Again, you've been reluctant to speak.

是的
Yes.

大约8周前 他告诉我
Some eight weeks ago he told me that

00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:38,993
有一些邮件从东区寄来

399
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:41,741
邮票上划着十字
marked by a cross under the stamp.

400
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:42,823
一个密码?
A code?

401
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,379
这些信是定期寄来的么?
And did they regularly?

402
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,942
不是定期的
Irregularly.

403
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,304
我不得拆阅 也不能跟别人说起
I was to leave them unopened and speak of them to no one.

404
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,695
你说邮件
You said missive.

405
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,085
不光是信么
They were not letters.

406

有些是 还有些是小包裹

不知道

这些都不由我经手
They didn't pass through my hands.

410
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,880
但有证据表明他确实回信了
Yet the evidence would suggest that he did respond.

411
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,562
印度人认为 狗是猴子的天敌
To the Hindu the dog is a traditional enemy of the monkey.

412
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,612
这说明什么 华生?

413
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,539
什么?

419
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,988
我邀请Alice来和我们喝茶
I've invited Alice to take tea with us.

420
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:29,765
别对你的未婚夫太严厉了 Presbury小姐
Do not be too severe upon your fiance Ms. Presbury.

421
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,933
他已经尽了全力
He has acted for the best.

422
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:36,287
另外 也请您继续每晚锁好门

00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,188
Jack 你不该带他到这来
Jack, you shouldn't have brought him in here.

426
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,483
我没有 但他坚持要来
I didn't want to but he insisted.

427
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,505
他说这里有极大的危险
He says there's grave danger.

428
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:54,282
那是歇洛克・福尔摩斯么
Was that Sherlock Holmes?

429
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:57,977
大侦探福尔摩斯?
The Sherlock Holmes?

430
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,233
你已经观察到了这件事情的核心 华生
Your observation goes to the very heart of this business Watson.

431
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:02,087
观察?

猴子和狗

现在 如果你好心的陪我去大学
Now if you'd be so kind as to accompany me to the university

435
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,100
你还可以继续去商业街

436
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,096
拜访一下Dorak
inquire after Dorak.

437
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,857
商业街可不是个具体地址 福尔摩斯
That's not an address Holmes.

438
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:16,641
这街有一里多长呢 从东边的Allgate一直到LimeHouse
The Commercial Road is a mile long from Allgate east to LimeHouse.

439
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:18,739
问问小商贩 Dorak的铺子在哪
We'll ask a custom monger where Dorak's shop.

440

走吧 华生 我要迟到了

在非洲 亚洲和南美洲的

443
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,748

充满了常见物种的各种声音和活动

以灵长目动物家族为例

446
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:44,201
这种身体活动
This physical activity,

447
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,867
像在树枝上晃荡
the swinging amongst branches,

448
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:50,232
或从一棵树的树顶 跳到另一棵树的树顶

449
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,964
以及发出刺耳的喊叫

450
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:58,067
不仅仅是为了捍卫在森林里的势力范围
not only defines territorial rights in the forest.

451
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,802
比如食物的采集
For example for food gathering,

452
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,864
其中大树和灌木的嫩芽
the tender shoots of tree and shrub

453
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:04,777
是特别的奖励

雄性展示力量的一种仪式

456

或者是为了防止不受欢迎的入侵者

457
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,683
或者是向某一只雌性
or to impress a particular female

展现它的性潜能

- 下午好 - 你在找人么

462
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,297
没有 隔壁倒是有个妓院
No, no, we got a Macker's Yard next door,

463
00:27:44,335 --> 00:27:45,004
就这样了
that's all.

464
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,904
哦 没错 你是对的
Oh, right, right you are.

465
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:49,589
此路不通
It's a dead end.

466
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,686
我看倒是可以过去
Oh, I could see a way through, yes.

467
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,250
你是条子还是怎么的
You're a narc or what?

468
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:54,982
当然不是
Not at all.

469
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,880
走开
Out.

470
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:58,076
你说什么
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:00,551
我说了 走开
I said out.

472
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,620
你是不肯听我的 是吧
You just can't take it in, can you?

473
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:18,688
-你说什么? -我说了走开 你就给我乖乖的走开
-I beg your pardon? -I said out and I meant out.

474
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:20,798
这里闲人免进 伙计
No admittance, mate.

475
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:21,967
这可是商业场所
These are commercial premises.

476
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:23,363
你这么说是什么意思
What do you mean by that?

477
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:25,241
我是说这是家商店
I mean it's a shop.

478
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:27,854
那今天肯定是很早就打烊了
It must be early closing day.

479
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,664
可真够荒唐的
This is ridiculous.

480
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:32,577
是么?
Is it?

481
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:41,136
亲爱的Lestrade 你这样的大人物
My dear Lestrade, I'm astonished that you,

482
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:42,412
竟来调查这么件小事
a man of your standing

483
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,622
真让我惊讶
should call upon so petty an errand.

484
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,114
Presbury教授对你的调查 表示了最强烈的抗议 福尔摩斯
Professor Presbury objects most strenuously to your investigations Mr. Holmes.

485
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,638
他抱怨说那是缺乏正当理由的骚扰
His complaint is that of unjustified harassment.

486
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,914
是否有正当理由还有待证明
The justification has yet to be proved.

487
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:57,999
Presbury是否把事实都告诉你了?
Has Presbury informed you of the facts?

488
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:58,696
当然
Of course.

489
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:00,425
那你的结论是...
And your conclusions?

490
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,311
这女孩在半梦半醒之间
A girl half asleep,

491
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:08,622
将一只猫或是鸟误认为是闯入者
mistook a cat or a bird or both for an intruder.

492
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,616
就是这样
That's all.

493
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:10,965
小事一桩
It's trifle.

494
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,669
就这么简单的解释?
Such a simple explanation,

495
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,239
但是 这说明不了家里的那条狗的行为
however, it begs the question of the family dog, does it not?

496
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:21,191
是不是?
Does it?

497
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:22,100
什么狗
What dog?

498
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:26,110
Presbury没有提及在这件事中 Roy的举止怪异么
Presbury did not mention Roy's part in this affair is strange.

499
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,254
好歹Roy也算半个目击者呢
Clearly a partial witness.

500
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,123
我建议你问问他
I suggest you ask him.

501
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,804
你没有掌握这个复杂的案件的全部事实
You're not in full possession of the facts of this complex case.

502
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:34,938
就算我相信你说的 这事比看上去复杂 福尔摩斯先生
Trust you to say there's more to it than meets the eye, Mr. Holmes.

503
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:38,140
没有这种刺激的话 我就不从事这个行当了
I never concern myself in anything without that stimulus.

504
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:41,066
但要是你一意孤行
If you persist you may find yourself

505
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:43,768
到头来可能会被提起个人诉讼的 你知道么
at the wrong end of a private prosecution you know.

506
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,007
教授是个很坚决的人
Professor Presbury is a determined man.

507
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:49,851
那和我倒是颇为相似哦
Then we're fairly matched, are we not?

508
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,943
我早知道你会是这样的
I knew it.

509
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:54,178
好吧 我要说的都说了
Well, I've said my say.

510
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:55,943
再见了
Mr. Holmes.

511
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,602
再见
Lestrade.

512
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,946
噢 你能行么?
Right, you can do it?

513
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,782
是的 比在Maidstone干的那一票容易
Yeah, easier than Maidstone,

514
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,509
可怜的老家伙
poor old fellow.

515
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:05,563
商业街144号
144 Commercial Road.

516
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:07,998
哦 你找到Dorak了 很好
Oh, you located Dorak, good.

517
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:11,250
就我目前所知道的 表面上看来
He appears to run a general store as far as I can tell.

518
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:14,741
他经营着一家杂货店 从熨斗到鱼钩什么都有
Sells everything from flatirons to fishhooks.

519
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,035
能说的详细点么?
Can you be more specific?

520
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:20,386
这家店生意不怎么好
Well, can't be a very prosperous business.

521
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:21,365
为什么呢?
Why not?

522
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:23,826
因为普通人是不让进的
Because the general public are not allowed in.

523
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:27,745
还发现什么?
Did you discover anything else?

524
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,694
除了在店旁的巷子里 被个野蛮的家伙威胁之外
Apart from being threatened by an unhelpful brute

525
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,725
就没有什么了
in an alley at the side, very little.

526
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:34,672
显然他就在那工作
He obviously works there because he followed me back

527
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,583
因为他又跟着我回到了杂货店 还威胁我
to the shop and threatened me again.

528
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,378
哦 还有另一个衣着光鲜的家伙
Oh, there was another fellow sharply dressed,

529
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:42,013
穿着马甲 留着小胡子
a waistcoat with a mustache.

530
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,951
叼着雪茄?
A Cheroot?

531
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,409
是的 叼着雪茄
Yes, yes, he did.

532
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,176
听起来像是Harry Wilcox
Sounds like Harry Wilcox,

533
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:51,122
通常在Soho广场附近活动 而不是东区
more usually of Soho Square than the East End.

534
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:52,082
还有什么?
Anything further?

535
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,009
没什么了...除了那气味
Not really except the smell.

536
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,737
那地方有种古怪的气味
There was a very odd smell about the place.

537
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:00,848
是什么的气味?
Of what?

538
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,476
不好说
Well it's not easy to say.

539
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,236
有点像是什么动物的
It belonged to the animal kingdom.

540
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,819
稻草或是马厩?
Straw or stables?

541
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,373
更像是动物园
More like a zoo.

542
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:31,149
你还没睡啊
You're still up.

543
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:34,423
是的 先生 我想整理完这些论据
Yes, sir, I thought I might finish these proofs.

544
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,390
你真是太尽责了 但你该去睡了
Very conscientious of you but no, no, you get to bed.

545
00:32:37,428 --> 00:32:39,057
我还是稍等会吧 先生
I'd rather not, sir.

546
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,825
-我想等... -去睡觉
-I should like... -Get to bed.

547
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:43,135
快去
Go on with you.

548
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,205
好的 先生 好的
Yes, sir, very well.

549
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:57,670
晚安 先生
Good night, sir.

550
00:32:58,321 --> 00:32:59,296
晚安
Good night.

551
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,789
亲爱的 快醒醒 是我
Darling wake up, it's me.

552
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:50,642
Edith?
Edith?

553
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:51,234
谁啊?
Who is it?

554
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:52,709
是我 快开门
It's me, open the door.

555
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,246
怎么回事?
What is it?

556
00:33:58,282 --> 00:33:59,404
我看到了
I saw,

557
00:34:00,014 --> 00:34:01,455
没法形容
I can't describe.

558
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:02,751
那个闯入者
Oh, the intruder.

559
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:04,311
我们得叫醒你父亲
We must rouse your father.

560
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,184
Presbury教授
Professor Presbury?

561
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,418
父亲
Father?

562
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,953
先生 先生
Sir, sir?

563
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,708
你们俩个怎么啦?
Both of you, what is it?

564
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,410
Jack觉得他看见了...
Jack thought he saw...

565
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,401
我相信
I fancied I,

566
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,736
我听到有人闯入 先生
I heard an intruder, sir.

567
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,780
是么?
You did?

568
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,123
是的 Roy也是躁动不安
Yes, Roy too was exercised

569
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:33,352
但我朝外看时 却什么都没有
but when I looked out just now there was nothing

570
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:35,296
Roy也安静了下来
and he since quieted down.

571
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:40,358
但你说你看到了...
But you thought you saw...

572
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,484
是的 我想我看到了...
Yes, I thought I saw...

573
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,053
什么?
Yes?

574
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,601
一只动物
An animal.

575
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:50,926
一只动物?
An animal?

576
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,472
不 可能是因为光线的原因看错了
No, it must have been a trick of the light, sir.

577
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,700
一定是这样 先生
Must have been, yes, sir.

578
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,352
是我弄错了
I was mistaken.

579
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,241
很抱歉
My apologies.

580
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,271
晚安
Good night.

581

Bennett
Bennett?

582
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:10,339
是的 先生
Yes, sir?

583
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,207
好好睡会
Get some sleep.

584
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,483
会有用的
There's a good chap.

585
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,443
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

586
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:14,351
"猴子失窃案"
*MONKEY THEFTS"

587
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:22,381
原来如此
Of course.

588
00:36:22,943 --> 00:36:24,241
华生
Watson?

589
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:27,984
华生
Watson?

590
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,219
华生
Watson?

591
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:50,631
是同一伙人干的
Unofficially a gang is at work.

592
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:53,312
其他动物园报告类似的失窃了么?
Other zoological gardens have reported similar thefts?

593
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,597
是的 我在Driscoll的同事在调查
Oh, yeah, my colleagues in Driscoll are investigating the theft

594
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:58,557
上周两只恒河猴和一只狒狒
of two rhesus monkeys and a baboon

595
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:01,003

牛津郡一个马戏团
A traveling menagerie in Oxfordshire

597
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:05,872
丢了一只珍贵的黑猩猩
lost a prized chimpanzee

598
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,913
还有Maidstone也丢了他们最好的大猩猩
and Maidstone, their finest gorilla.

599
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,581
-"大Charlie"? -是的
-Big Charlie? -Yeah.

600
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,046
那个讨人喜欢的家伙 我很熟悉它
Delightful chap. I knew him well.

601
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:16,530
它们都消失的无影无踪
Well, they've all disappeared without a trace.

602
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,285
福尔摩斯先生感兴趣的是什么?
And Mr. Holmes, what's his interest?

603
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,129
他认为这可能与他手里的
He insisted to me that this may have relevance

604
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,048
另外一个案子有关
to another case he has in hand.

605
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:26,648
要是可能的话 一般我们都会迁就他
We like to indulge him when we can.

606
00:37:27,357 --> 00:37:29,517
找到你想要的了么  福尔摩斯先生?
Find anything to the purpose, Mr. Holmes?

607
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:30,383
没什么
Nothing much.

608
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,782
我告诉过你的
I warned you,

609
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,983
我的人已经把这里仔细梳理过了
my men have been through it with a tooth comb.

610
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,534
开锁的是Stepping Green的Jenkins
The lock was released by Jenkins of Stepping Green.

611
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:41,023
猩猩是被一小包氯仿给麻醉的

612
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,666
这个人头发还上了发蜡

613
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:47,719
是从Jernin街的Brewster先生那买来的
with Mr. Brewster of Jernin Street's Pomade.

614
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:50,630
这还表明这个人的胡子也上了蜡
This would suggest that he also sports a waxed mustache,

615
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:54,154
Brewster先生以经营男士发蜡而出名
Mr. Brewster being celebrated for his cosmetic wax for gentlemen.

616
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:57,174
这么看来 Lestrade
If this was so Lestrade you could do worse

617
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,550
去跟Soho广场的Harry谈谈 是没有坏处的
than have a word with Harry the Tash Wilcox  of Soho.

618
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:01,762
天啊 福尔摩斯
Good lord Holmes,

619
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:04,406
对你来说是"没什么" 对别人来说可是了不得的资料了
you're nothing much.Would be anyone else a great deal.

620
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,456
是的 不过我相信 要是我们的人把报告交上来
Yes, well I'm sure my men will arrive at the same conclusion

621
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,095
里头也会有相同的结论的
once their reports are in hand.

622
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:11,308
你自然也注意到了 Lestrade
You will also naturally have noticed Lestrade

623
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:12,993
这是这几周来
that this is the sixth reported theft

624
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,472
第六宗成年雄性灵长类动物失窃案了
of a mature male primate in as many weeks.

625
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,012
是嘛 有六起啊?
Is it six?

626
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,413
怪事
Exceptional.

627
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,102
我想重要的是这些失窃动物的性别
The gender of the animals removed is I suggest of the essence.

628
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,205
再见
Good day.

629
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,203
请进
Come in.

630
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:54,150
我最亲爱的Alice
My dearest Alice.

631
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,507
我没有打扰你的工作吧?
I'm not interrupting your work?

632
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:57,727
没有
No, no.

633
00:38:58,257 --> 00:38:59,617
我也没有忙什么
I wasn't seriously engaged,

634
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,869
只是整理些笔记以备查考 没什么的
just some notes of future inquiry, nothing more.

635
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:06,172
我们去客厅好么
Shall we go to the drawing room?

636
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,555
年轻女士在这儿恐怕不会感到愉快
This is hardly the place to entertain a young lady.

637
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:09,948
不必了
No.

638
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,181
哦 天哪
Oh, dear.

639
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,649
我亲爱的 怎么了?
My dear child, what is the matter?

640
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,642
我以前就该告诉你的
I ought to have said before.

641
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,813
告诉什么?
Ought to what?

642
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:27,789
你得把这个收回去
There, you must take it back.

643
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,702
可是 Alice
But Alice.

644
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,812
我不能嫁给你
I can't marry you.

645
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,275
我以前不该答应的
I shouldn't have said I would,

646
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:36,859
但我不敢说不
but I was afraid to say no.

647
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,652
请你拿回去
Please take it back.

648
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:44,511
-胡说 这只不过是... -不 你得拿回去
-Nonsense, This is simply... -No, you must take it.

649
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,980
很对不起
There, I'm sorry.

650
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:49,043
Alice
Alice.

651
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,737
不 你很老
No, you're old,

652
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,064
太老了
you're too old.

653
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:04,808
这么说 Bennett确实在房子里看到了 闯入者的影子
So, Bennett actually saw the intruders shadow inside the house.

654
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,728
但却查不出任何的蛛丝马迹
But upon investigation could find no further trace.

655
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:09,870
你得让屠夫家的男孩把这个交给他
You must get this to him by way of the butcher's boy.

656
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,945
你要来么?
Are you coming?

657
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:11,787
去哪?
Where to?

658
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:12,956
去Dorak的杂货铺
Dorak's Emporium,

659
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:17,083
特别是Jenkins守着 不让你进去的那些地方
especially those parts where Jenkins took such pains to guard against you.

660
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,925
-有兴趣么? -很乐意去
-Are you game? -Delighted.

661
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,261
你带着武器去?
You go armed?

662
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,914
我去Allgate东区从来都带着枪的 华生
Always carry a firearm east of Allgate, Watson.

663
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,856
我担心的就是这个
It's as I feared.

664
00:41:57,705 --> 00:41:59,795
我们就等着你来访呢 福尔摩斯先生
We was waiting on a visit, Mr. Holmes.

665
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:00,916
Wilcox
Wilcox!

666
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,659
还有Jenkins
And Jenkins.

667
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:33,979
老天作证 福尔摩斯
By heavens Holmes,

668
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:35,224
我闻到的就是这个味道
this is what I smelt.

669
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,117
这就是Dorak的病人
These are Dorak's patients,

670
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,495
被虐待的可怜家伙
poor abused creatures.

671
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:41,547
你看过Dorak
Have you observed the experiments

672
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:42,941
在它们身上做手术么?
that Dorak performs on them?

673
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:45,093
没有 他说这不关我们什么事
Oh, no that's none of our business he says.

674
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,174
那就算你自己走运
Well count yourself fortunate

675
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:49,050
不会起诉到你的
that the process has been kept from you.

676
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,587
现在 先生们 进去吧
Now gentlemen in you go.

677
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,236
到里面去 跟它在一起? 为什么?
In there with him? Why?

678
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,821
等着警察来
To await the police.

679
00:42:57,858 --> 00:42:59,263
进去 先生们
In gentlemen.

680
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:04,323
我会让Lestrade探长马上过来
I should advise Inspector Lestrade at once.

681
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,112
你不能把我们关在这
You can't leave us in here.

682
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,093
别忘了大猩猩也是爱交际的动物
Remember the gorilla is a social animal

683
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,859
如果你俩都注意举止
and if you both mind your manners

684
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,936
我敢说你们会相处的很融洽的
you will do well enough I dare say.

685
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:30,766
Bennett先生 还有Presbury小姐
Mr. Bennett and Ms. Presbury.

686
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:31,902
是的
Yes.

687
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:33,709
我决定要陪着Jack 福尔摩斯先生
I decided I had to accompany Jack, Mr. Holmes.

688
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:34,353
我很高兴
I'm delighted.

689
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,953
有没有把举止失常的日期列出来?
Have you brought the list of missing dates?

690
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,759
是的 还有Roy在这些日子里也都叫了
Yes, Roy also barked on these nights.

691
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:42,620
先别管那个了 福尔摩斯先生
Please never mind that Mr. Holmes.

692
00:43:42,657 --> 00:43:44,676
我们还有更紧急的事要告诉您
We have far more urgent matters to impart.

693
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:45,851
是什么?
Is that so?

694
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:48,611
Morphy小姐解除了和我父亲的婚约
Ms. Morphy has renounced my father.

695
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,485
她把戒指也退回来了?
She's returned his ring?

696
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:51,544
是的 就在今天
Today.

697
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:53,528
然后教授就把自己反锁在书房
Since when he has remained locked in his study.

698
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:55,545
每次我去敲门他都粗暴地向我喊叫
Every time I've knocked he's shouted abuse at me.

699
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:56,319
我们担心...
We, we fear...

700
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:57,568
这些数字之间有什么联系 华生
The logic of it Watson,

701
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,896
你看出来了么?
of this progression, do you see it?

702
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:00,740
是什么?
Please?

703
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,598
最开始的三次是显而易见的
The first three occasions are self-evident.

704
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:03,916
我们都知道
We know of those.

705
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:06,061
在10月5日发生了什么?
What happened on the 5th of October?

706
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:11,021
Roy整个晚上都在叫 12日也是
Roy barked all night, on the 12th too.

707
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:13,158
这也是教授收到从伦敦东区
They're also days upon which the professor

708
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,177
寄来的包裹的日子
received packages from London East Central.

709
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:17,399
这天是在窗口出现了人影的时间
This is the date on which the face appeared

710
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:18,721
在四天前?
at the window four nights ago?

711
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:19,878
是的
Yes.

712
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:23,607
这是昨晚你看到黑影的时间
And this is where the shadow appeared last night.

713
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,896
对了
Of course!

714
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:29,356
共同的因素有两个
The common factor is two.

715
00:44:29,393 --> 00:44:32,334
总是有两天的间隔
Always the gap decreases by two days.

716
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:34,302
我真是个傻瓜
Numskull, Holmes.

717
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,290
而今天是10月21日
And today is the 21st of October.

718
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,636
有么?
Did?

719
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:49,156
是的 有个包裹 今天早上到的
Yes, a package arrived this morning.

720
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:53,644
决定性的时刻到了
And the crisis is upon us.

721
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:55,754
昨晚不过是个序幕
Last night was but the precursor.

722
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,958
快 我们得马上出发
Come, we must go at once.

723
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,848
快 快点 路上再给你们解释
Come along, come along, I'll explain on the way.

724
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:14,819
前门是开的
The front door is open.

725
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:21,565
Bennett 到楼上检查
Bennett, examine upstairs.

726
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:22,651
华生
Watson.

727
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,841
果然如此
I thought as much.

728
00:45:41,877 --> 00:45:42,857
你听见了么 福尔摩斯先生?
Did you hear Mr. Holmes?

729
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:45,048
听到了 Prsbury小姐 听的很清楚
Too well, Ms. Presbury, too well.

730
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:51,829
看那上面 快看
Up there, look.

731
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:01,128
老天啊 福尔摩斯 你说对了
My heavens Holmes, you were right.

732
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,598
他朝Morphy小姐家走了
He's headed across to Ms. Morphy's house.

733
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:35,441
Bennett 留在这保护小姐
Bennett stay here and protect Ms. Presbury.

734
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:13,053
他的目标是阳台
He's aiming for that balcony.

735
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:18,024
门是锁上的
It's locked.

736
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,573
狗 华生 留心狗
The dog Watson, the dog.

737
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:47,766
走开
Stay away,

738
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:49,933
请你走开
please keep away.

739
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,088
真是侥幸
It was a close thing,

740
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:14,889
差一点就咬到颈动脉了
just missed the carotid artery.

741
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:16,298
他还好么?
Is he all right?

742
00:48:16,842 --> 00:48:17,860
性命没有大碍
He'll live.

743
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:22,179
我相信这件事之后 他会改过自新
A reformed man I have no doubt after his experience.

744
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:26,788
亲爱的Lestrade 我希望把这事归功于你
My dear Lestrade I quite intended you to have the credit

745
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:30,742
但要指证Dorak Wilcox和Jenkins 了结这案子
but to complete the case against Dorak, Wilcox and Jenkins

746
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:32,400
你还需要这个 
you'll need this.

747
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,780
这是确实的证据
Here is the incontrovertible proof

748
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:37,325
他们偷那些动物
that those animals you've rescued from degradation

749
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,431
为的就是获取血清
were stolen for the sake of their glands.

750
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:43,202
那些动物被高价买卖
The animal extract was sold at an enormous profit

751
00:48:43,238 --> 00:48:44,918
是因为有些十分愚蠢或绝望的人
to those foolish or desperate enough

752
00:48:44,956 --> 00:48:46,521
幻想用它们的血清
to imagine that a course of serum

753
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,453
来恢复青春
could restore their lost vitality

754
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,890
而没有其他副作用
without any other effects.

755
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:53,290
我十分感激你 福尔摩斯先生
I am grateful to you Mr. Holmes.

756
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:56,237
因为有你 我们才查到了犯罪的源头
Thanks to you we've traced the evil to its source.

757
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,666
也许吧 可是可怜的Presbury
Perhaps, but poor Presbury.

758
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:02,426
一个人想要凌驾于自然
When one tries to rise above nature,

759
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,504
他就会堕落到丧失本性
one is liable to fall below it.

760
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,440
最高等的人
The highest type of man

761
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:09,278
一旦偏离了人类注定的轨迹
may revert to the animal

762
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:12,743
就会变成动物
when he leaves the straight road of destiny.

763
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:16,585
哲学上的事情还是留给你自己去想吧 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, well I'll leave the philosophy to you Mr. Holmes.

764
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:19,056
真是明智之举 Lestrade 我一向都是这么干的
Quite the best Lestrade, I always do.

765
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:21,724
那条爱尔兰猎狗要人道毁灭么?
Is the wolfhound to be destroyed?

766
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:25,857
不 不 Roy攻击的是猴子 而不是人
Oh, no, no it was the monkey that Roy attacked, not the man.

767
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:29,050
狗会和他的主人一样都恢复原样的
But the dog will be himself again quite as much as his master.

768
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,103
谢谢二位
Well, thank you both.

769
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:34,996
再见 先生们
Good day, gentlemen.

770
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,521
再见 Lestrade
Good day Lestrade.

771
