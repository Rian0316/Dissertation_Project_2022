1
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,400

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,300

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,300

4
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,000
格兰其庄园

5
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:08,419
巴纳
Barna.

6
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:19,253
起来 华生
Come, Watson,

7
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:21,795
快起来
come.

8
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:25,132
事情十分急迫
The game is afoot.

9
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,009
穿好衣服赶快走
Get your clothes and come.

10
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,979
我想我们俩
Well I think we have

11
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:46,825
已经很默契了 福尔摩斯
thawed sufficiently Holmes.

12
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:48,743
没错
Splendid.

13
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,721
肯特 玛尔舍姆 格兰其庄园 下午3:30
Abbey Grange, Marsham, Kent, 3:30 a.m.

14
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,601
亲爱的福尔摩斯先生
My Dear Mr. Holmes

15
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:57,482
我希望你能够立刻协助我
I should be very glad of your immediate assistance

16
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:01,072
解决这桩极特殊的案件
in what promises to be a most remarkable case.

17
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,293
处理这一类案件正是你的特长
There's something quite in your line.

18
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:04,904
除去已把那位女士放开之外
Except for releasing the lady

19
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,672
现场一切东西
I will see that everything is kept

20
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,211
都未移动
exactly as I have found it,

21
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:10,016
我请求你火速赶来
but I beg you not to lose an instant,

22
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:14,784
因为单独留下优斯塔斯爵士是不妥当的
as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there.

23
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,003
您的忠实朋友
Yours faithfully.

24
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,445
斯坦莱・霍普金
Stanley Hopkins.

25
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,429
霍普金巡关
Inspector Hopkins.

26
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,094
他找我到现场
He's called you in seven times,

27
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,671
曾有七次 每次
on each occasion his summons

28
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,653
确实都急需我的帮助
has been entirely justified.

29
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,745
我想你一定已经把他的案子
I fancy that every one of his cases

30
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:31,080
全收到你的文集里去了
has found its way into your collection,

31
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,477
我承认
and I must admit, Watson,

32
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:34,771
你很会选材
you do have some power of selection.

33
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,546
谢谢
Thank you.

34
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,095
这弥补了你
Which atones for much of which I deplore

35
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,316
叙述上的缺陷
about your narratives.

36
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:43,201
你看待一切问题总是
Your fatal habit of looking at everything

37
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:44,937
从写故事的角度出发
from the point of view of a story

38
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,512
而不是从科学破案的角度
instead of as a scientific exercise

39
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,541
这样就毁坏了
has ruined what might have been

40
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:51,382
这些典型案例的
an instructive and even classical

41
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,057
示范性和教益性
series of demonstrations.

42
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,124
你为什么不自己写呢?
Why did you not write them yourself?

43
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,151
我会写的 华生 
I will, my dear Watson, I will,

44
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:02,737
我会在我晚年的时候写的
in my declining years.

45
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,341
我们现在要侦查的
So our present research

46
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:05,873
像是一件谋杀案
appears to be one of murder.

47
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,405
是吗?
Does it?

48
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:10,183
信上有E B两个字母
'E. B.' monogram,

49
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,765
组成的图案做为家徽
coat-of-arms,

50
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,473
这个地址曾经
with an address which harks back

51
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,430
是修道院
to the dissolution of the monasteries.

52
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,568
他们生活在上流社会
They're moving in high-life.

53
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,264
布莱肯斯特尔
Brackenstall.

54
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,442
优斯塔斯・布莱肯斯特尔爵士
Sir Eustace Brackenstall.

55
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:27,008
你听说过他?
You've heard of him?

56
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,669
他是有史以来
He was quoted in The Chronicle the other day

57
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,450
肯特郡最大的富翁
as being one of the richest men in Kent.

58
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,640
华生 你真是知识渊博
Watson, you are a treasury of knowledge.

59
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,570
这么说你认为他已经死了?
And you think him dead?

60
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:39,433
我认为他被谋杀了 华生
I think him murdered, Watson.

61
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,988
霍普金并不是易动感情的人
Hopkins is not an emotional man.

62
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,116
他的信说明他心情相当激动
The writing shows a certain agitation.

63
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:47,514
事情一定很紧急
It is surely urgent.

64
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,178
你认为尸体是否还留在那
You think the body left there

65
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,338
等着我们去验尸?
for our own inspection?

66
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,437
我想我们会发现
I think that we shall find

67
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,544
布莱肯斯特尔家的人已经所剩无几了
the Brackenstall line is now extinct.

68
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,520
你们能来我真高兴 福尔摩斯先生
Very good of you to come, Mr. Holmes.

69
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,734
你也是 医生
And you, Doctor.

70
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:37,832
巡官
Inspector.

71
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,239
希望你能原谅我 福尔摩斯先生
I hope you forgive me, Mr. Holmes.

72
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,870
原谅你什么 霍普金?
Forgive what, Hopkins?

73
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:44,969
要不是事情紧急 也不会来麻烦你
I should not have troubled you sir.

74
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,810
现在那位女士已经苏醒过来
But since the lady has come to herself,

75
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,905
她把事情讲得很清楚
she has given me so clear an account of the affair

76
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,195
所以我们要做的事不多了
that well there's not much left for us to do.

77
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,007
你还记得路易珊姆那伙强盗吗?
You remember the Lewisham gang?

78
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,402
就是那三个姓阮达尔的吗?
The ring of three Randalls?

79
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,583
正是
Exactly sir

80
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,429
父亲和两个儿子
the father and two sons.

81
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:58,480
是他们干的
It's their work.

82
00:05:58,552 --> 00:05:59,561
这毫无疑问
Not a doubt.

83
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,435
两周前他们在西顿汉姆做了案
But they did a job at Sydenham a fortnight ago

84
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,874
有人看到了他们并报了案
They did, they were seen and described.

85
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,276
他们真是残忍
Well it's cool and I agree

86
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,226
这么快就又害人了
to do another so soon and so near,

87
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,725
一定是他们干的
but it is they,

88
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:10,937
应该把他们绞死
and a hanging matter this time.

89
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,678
那么优斯塔斯爵士死了?
Brackenstall is dead, then?

90
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,383
是的 医生
Awe yes, Doctor.

91
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,994
就在餐厅里
In the dining room,

92
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,347
他的头部
his head was knocked in

93
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,049
被通条打破了
with his own poker.

94
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,268
那女士呢?
And the lady?

95
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,070
他们去过餐厅了吗?
Have they been in the dining room yet?

96
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:46,004
还没 夫人
Not yet, my lady.

97
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,948
你的周到安排让我感到欣慰
I shall be glad when you can arrange matters.

98
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,172
那是什么?
What is that?

99
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:56,376
您的伤不止一处 夫人!
You have other injuries, madam!

100
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,438
这没什么
It's nothing.

101
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:02,191
这和夜里的惨案没有关系
It has no connection with this hideous business.

102
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,690
请坐吧
Please sit down.

103
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,062
我把一切关于
I think it would be best

104
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,254
优斯塔斯爵士的事
to inform you of something gentlemen

105
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,528
都告诉你们
regarding Sir Eustace.

106
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,447
你们无疑会听到
You'll no doubt hear a rumor of it otherwise

107
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,053
他人歪曲事实的
from idol tongues

108
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,379
闲言碎语
who'll distort the truth of it.

109
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,987
以这种方式玷污他的人格
It would pain me to think

110
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,288
让我备受痛苦
of his memory tarnished in that way.

111
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,269
但我还是得说
Sir Eustace drank

112
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:34,267
优斯塔斯爵士嗜酒成癖
I'm afraid.

113
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:37,083
没有规律 反复无常
Not regularly, inconsistently.

114
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:40,154
但并不会影响我们的婚姻
Not in a way to hurt our marriage.

115
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,721
也没有妨碍
Nor did it interfere

116
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:46,030
他执行公务的能力
with the exercise of his public duties.

117
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,365
尽管如此
Nevertheless,

118
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:52,373
这一恶习仍是家族丑闻
the vice was a private shame to him.

119
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:55,997
我不喜欢他的恶习 对此他十分在意
He was very sensible of my dislike of it.

120
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,014
当他酒瘾发作时
When he felt the obsession to keenly

121
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,227
他就会完全放纵自己
he took himself off

122
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,145
喝得烂醉
until the poison had exhausted him.

123
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,573
他的做法自然
It distressed me of course

124
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:08,184
让我悲痛万分
that it should happen

125
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,582
但他仍保持着自尊
but he was proud and sensitive enough

126
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,471
从不让我看见他烂醉的模样
never to allow me to witness it.

127
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,362
对此 我很感激
I felt deep gratitude for that

128
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:23,850
而且深表同情
and not a little pity.

129
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,428
你能明白吗 先生?
Can you understand that gentlemen?

130
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:28,828
我从未听过有人在谈起这类事情时
I have never heard a like case talked of

131
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:34,186
还怀着深切的同情 夫人
with such illuminating compassion madam.

132
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,819
我想还有件事
I must, however, ask you

133
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:38,336
会让你更惊奇的
to believe something further.

134
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,034
对于拥有如此恶习的丈夫
I was in some measure grateful

135
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,920
我仍是很感激的
for this vice of my husband's.

136
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,586
怎么会?
How could that be?

137
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,659
我是在澳大利亚南部
I spent most of my life in South Australia,

138
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,713
一个靠近阿得雷德的
in the wine growing country

139
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:52,013
酿酒村庄长大的
near Adelaide.

140
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,374
在我很小时
As a very young woman

141
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,050
我就和我父亲生活在一起
I lived alone with my father.

142
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,280
我妈妈已经去世
My mother was dead.

143
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,312
真要说谁给了我母爱
If I had a mother

144
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:07,993
那就是我忠诚的梯芮萨
it was my loyal Theresa.

145
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:12,491
那是一段非常自由的生活
It was a very free life.

146
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,513
我发现我很难
I found it extremely difficult

147
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,570
在英国适应
to adapt to the proprieties of England

148
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:20,951
庄园夫人这样的身份
being mistress of such a place as this.

149
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,213
所以我想 如果
So I felt if I would

150
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,097
对于我丈夫的恶习
just show a decent understanding

151
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,869
表达出更大的宽容
of my husband's weakness

152
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:28,158
相反 他也会
he would, in turn,

153
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:31,393
原谅我一些失礼的举动
forgive me for my unsuitable behavior.

154
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,576
而事实也正是如此
And so it proved.

155
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,766
我明白了
I see.

156
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:41,218
现在我来告诉你昨晚的事
I'll tell you about last night.

157
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,594
优斯塔斯爵士大约10点半休息
Eustace retired about half-past ten.

158
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,581
仆人们都已经回到自己的屋子
The servants had already gone to their quarters.

159
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:47,725
他们的屋子在哪?
Which are where?

160
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:48,980
在东翼
In the East Wing.

161
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,683
只有我的丈夫 梯芮萨和我
Only my husband, Theresa and myself

162
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,082
住在正中部分
sleep in the central block.

163
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,688
其他仆人听不到这的响声
The servants would have heard nothing.

164
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,812
你那时休息了吗?
Had you retired by then?

165
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:57,617
我在自己的房间
I was in my room.

166
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,676
在夫人未上床休息前我是不会休息的
I never retire until I've seen madam to bed.

167
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,111
谢谢
Thank you.

168
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,141
我还未睡下
I sat up,

169
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,791
就坐在这屋子里
this room in fact.

170
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,778
我有个习惯就是
It is my custom to walk around

171
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,450
睡前总要检查下房屋是否安全
to see that the house is secure

172
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,029
因为显而易见
because for obvious reasons,

173
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,203
优斯塔斯爵士
Sir Eustace

174
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,636
在这方面
is not always to be relied upon

175
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,100
是靠不住的
in that respect.

176
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:51,141
我先去猎枪室
I went into the gun-room,

177
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:55,349
厨房
the kitchen,

178
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,252
食起室
the butler's pantry,

179
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,773
弹子房
the billiard-room,

180
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,803
客厅
the drawing-room,

181
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:10,637
最后是餐厅
and finally the dining-room

182
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,109
看到窗帘没拉上
where the curtains were drawn.

183
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,831
很难告诉你
It's difficult to tell you

184
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,639
之后发生了什么
much of what happened next.

185
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:48,103
我走到窗前
I took a step towards the curtain

186
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,567
迎面站着
and I found myself

187
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:51,693
一个闯入者
face-to-face with an intruder.

188
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,817
体型庞大
A big man,

189
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:57,152
年过半百
quite elderly.

190
00:11:57,231 --> 00:12:00,982
我们对视了一会
For a moment we just stared at each other.

191
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,137
然后有两个男人出现在他背后
Then two other men came in behind him

192
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,297
这个人立即向我扑来
and he came for me.

193
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,039
我一定是昏过去了
I must have been unconscious

194
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
好几分钟
for some minutes.

195
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,585
正在这时我倒霉的丈夫
It was then that my unfortunate husband

196
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,196
来到餐厅
entered the room.

197
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:44,375
正如你们看到的 他们杀了他
They dealt with him as you shall see.

198
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:48,720
我又一次昏过去 我也不确定
I believe I fainted again, I'm not sure.

199
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,063
具体的事很难...
The exact events are difficult...

200
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:53,839
我时而清醒 时而昏迷
I drifted in and out of consciousness,

201
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:57,526
你能理解吗?
you understand?

202
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,103
我知道他们
I do know that they

203
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,799
拿走了屋子里的银器
cleared the room of its silver

204
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,411
他们给自己开了瓶
and they must have drawn themselves

205
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,144
波特酒
a bottle of port,

206
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,693
我看到他们喝酒了
some of which I saw them drink.

207
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:07,976
袭击我的人
The man who struck me

208
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,166
是个留有胡须的中年人
was elderly with a beard.

209
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,672
另外两个年轻人
The others younger,

210
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,929
面部很干净
smooth faced.

211
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,263
是的
Yes.

212
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:18,560
他们走过来看看是否已把我缚紧
Finally they checked that I was securely bound

213
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,001
然后带着银器离开了
and left taking the silver with them.

214
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:23,784
你是何时发觉情况不对的?
How was the alarm raised?

215
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,759
夫人一直没有上楼
Madam had not come upstairs.

216
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,850
早前她说过在我之后就会上楼
Early she said she would follow me shortly

217
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,238
所以到了午夜 我就下楼看看
so at midnight I went down

218
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,081
以防她又抱着书睡着了
in case she had fallen asleep over her book.

219
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,522
我讨厌抱着书睡着
A thing I hate to do.

220
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,295
于是我就发现了夫人 可怜的人儿
And there I found her, poor lamb,

221
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:38,797
正如她说的
just as she says

222
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,115
爵士倒在地板上
and him on the floor,

223
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:44,574
他的血和脑浆溅了一屋子
his blood and brains all over the room.

224
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,667
这些事足以使她吓昏过去
Enough to drive a woman out of her wits.

225
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,233
她被绑在那儿 还被塞住了嘴
And her gagged and bound

226
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,677
衣服上还溅上了许多血点
and her very dress spotted with him.

227
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,515
要不是这位澳大利亚阿得雷德港的
She never wanted courage,

228
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:59,621
玛丽・弗莱泽夫人 也就是格兰其庄园的
did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide,

229
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,745
布莱肯斯特尔夫人变得性格坚强
and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange

230
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,808
那她早就失去生活的勇气了
has learned new ways.

231
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,612
你们询问她的时间已经够长了
You've questioned her long enough, gentlemen.

232
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,266
这位夫人和她的女仆
When did the lady and the maid

233
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:10,761
是何时离开澳大利亚的?
come from Australia?

234
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:11,938
大约十八个月前
About eighteen months ago, sir.

235
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,265
她爸爸送她
Her father sent her

236
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:14,313
来欧洲体验生活
to get her experience of Europe.

237
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,775
实际是为了找个丈夫吧?
That is to a find a husband?

238
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,317
可怜的女人那时一定以为嫁了个好夫君
Poor woman must have seen the bruited match.

239
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,158
现场一片狼藉 先生
It's a mess sir.

240
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,896
警官
Constable.

241
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,253
的确是一片狼藉
A mess indeed.

242
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,685
他们没有碰过任何东西
They've touched nothing sir.

243
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,254
你有何看法 医生?
What do you make of it, Doctor?

244
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,502
我可以验下尸吗?
Should I?

245
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,454
可以 我亲爱的朋友
Please proceed my dear fellow.

246
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:50,799
一击毙命
Why it's a blow.

247
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,158
狠狠地一击
Of savage velocity.

248
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,482
只有一击吗?
A single blow?

249
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:55,468
我想是的
I believe so.

250
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:59,614
你看 伤口很明显
It is a straightforward enough wound, you see

251
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,808
从耳部开始
it begins thus below the ear

252
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,038
以这个角度
and then crosses both spheres

253
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:08,454
伤至顶骨
of the parietal bone at such an angle.

254
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,418
而这一边则被
That this side is smashed

255
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,638
击致颅缝
as far as the cranial suture.

256
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,497
我从未见过这样的伤口
I've never seen anything like it.

257
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,494
这个上了年纪的阮达尔 力气一定很大
A powerful man, this elder Randall.

258
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:26,112
他干的一半勾当都和暴力有关
Half his trade is violence sir.

259
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,855
显然这次他也运用了自己的优势
He certainly left his trademark.

260
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:30,110
让我想不通的是
What beats me

261
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:33,773
既然他们知道
is how Randall could do so mad a thing,

262
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,029
夫人能说出他们的外貌
knowing that the lady could describe them,

263
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:37,638
并且我们也能认出他们
and that we could not fail

264
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,299
为什么他们还会做出这种蠢事
to recognize the description.

265
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,291
犯罪心理是难以捉摸的
The criminal mind has its quirks

266
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,955
也许有时会带有良知的顾虑
of consciousness scruples.

267
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:44,177
从这个角度考虑
In that respect,

268
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:47,176
此案与其他案件一样拥有独特奇怪之处
it is as individual and curious as any other.

269
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:50,408
这位夫人也许看似吝啬 实则十分慷慨
A noted miser, Lady, secretly charitable

270
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,886
所以残暴的阮达尔打消了
so this violent Randall may draw the line

271
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:56,059
杀死这位昏迷的夫人的念头
at the murder of an unconscious woman.

272
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,633
要不就是他确信
Or he may well believe

273
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,332
这位夫人没有看到他
that she did not see him.

274
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,658
这怎么可能呢 先生?
Well how is that sir?

275
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,369
她说他们俩对视了一会儿
She testifies that they stared at each other.

276
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,326
没错 但拿着蜡烛的是她
Yes but it was she who held the light.

277
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,790
而阮达尔看到的
What Randall may have seen

278
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:11,413
极有可能只是闪烁的烛光
was mostly flickering candle flame.

279
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:16,074
烛光后的相貌
The face behind it,

280
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:19,794
只是模糊的影子罢了
a distorted mask.

281
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,859
他也许没想到
He may be not imaginative enough

282
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,355
她看到的
to have thought that she saw

283
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,267
并不比他清楚
anymore than he did.

284
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,361
所以他立马打昏了她
He knocked her unconscious at the next instance,

285
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:28,927
这样就可以达到他的目的
thus for his purposes

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,804
彻底解决问题...华生?
solving his problem... Watson?

287
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:36,090
你能检查下土耳其地毯吗?
May I impose upon you to search the Turkey rug?

288
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,561
检查地毯干吗 福尔摩斯?
What for Holmes?

289
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:41,742
看看是否有蜡滴 华生
Candle wax, Watson, candle wax.

290
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,969
这条铃绳很有问题
Now this bell presents a mystery,

291
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:46,298
不是吗 巡官?
does it not Inspector?

292
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,346
先生
Sir.

293
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,699
绳子往下一拉
When this was pulled down

294
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,166
厨房的铃声应该是很响的
the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly.

295
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,415
由于厨房的位置
No one would hear it

296
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,738
没人能听得到
the way the kitchen is placed.

297
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,096
这个情况强盗怎么会知道的呢?
How did the burglar know that?

298
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:55,871
确实 福尔摩斯先生 
Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly.

299
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,682
这个问题 我也反复考虑过
For the very question I've put myself.

300
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:59,635
强盗一定很熟悉这栋房子
Now either he has known the house

301
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,443
要不他准和
or he may have dealings

302
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,838
某个仆人有勾结
with one of the servants.

303
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,409
我的手下正在
One of my men is going over the record of service

304
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,284
警局给仆役长
at the station with the butler,

305
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,890
录笔录
at this very moment sir.

306
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,492
巡官 你考虑得很周到
Inspector, you seem to have thought of everything.

307
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,775
谢谢你 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

308
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:11,824
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

309
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,427
怎么了 华生?
What is it Watson?

310
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,182
看
There.

311
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,479
一小滴蜡
A scattering of wax

312
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,335
而且有轻微地硫化
and a very light scorching.

313
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:25,718
已经清理掉了
Invisible,

314
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,009
但仍留有其独特的味道
but leaving it's characteristic scent.

315
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,567
夫人一定是在这昏倒的
The lady would have fallen here.

316
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,135
而阮达尔迅速
Randall would have snatched up

317
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,534
接住了烛台
the candelabra immediately.

318
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:38,776
我想他们在那
I suppose that is

319
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,757
吃了些小点心
where they took their refreshment.

320
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:41,804
是的 以此缓解紧张的心情
To steady their nerves, yes.

321
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,372
是波特酒 先生
Port wine, sir.

322
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,796
布莱肯斯特尔夫人有说
Did Lady Brackenstall say

323
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,401
他们用拔塞钻了吗?
that the butler's corkscrew was used?

324
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,683
没有 先生
No sir.

325
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,043
这伙强盗开酒瓶的时候
She was senseless at the moment

326
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,473
她已经失去了知觉
the bottle was opened.

327
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:51,757
的确是这样
Quite so.

328
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,542
他们是用螺旋器开瓶的
It was opened with a pocket screw,

329
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,496
很有可能是小刀上带的螺旋
probably contained in a knife.

330
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:59,004
仔细观察软木塞的上部可以看出
If you examine the top of the cork you will observe

331
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,024
螺旋插了三次
that the screw was driven in three times

332
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,316
才拔出软木塞
before the cork was extracted.

333
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:06,423
其实用拔塞钻卡住瓶塞
This long screw would have transfixed it

334
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:09,652
一下便能拔出来
and drawn it with a single pull.

335
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,193
你抓到这个人的时候
When you catch this fellow,

336
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,689
你会发现
it is likely that you will find

337
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,423
他身上有把多用小刀
that he has a multiplex knife in his possession.

338
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,271
分析得妙极了 福尔摩斯先生
Excellent, Mr. Holmes.

339
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:21,247
这三个玻璃杯
These three glasses

340
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,132
确实困扰着我
do puzzle me,

341
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,082
这我必须承认
I must confess.

342
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,110
布莱肯斯特尔夫人确实
Did Lady Brackenstall say

343
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:34,174
看见这三个人喝酒了?
that she actually saw the three men drinking?

344
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,403
是的 这一点她记得很清楚
Awe yes, she was clear about that, sir.

345
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,485
那么 这个情况就说到这儿
Well then there is an end of it.

346
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,715
还有什么可说的吗?
What more is to be said?

347
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,061
巡官 也许像夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Perhaps, Inspector, when a man has special powers

348
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,049
这样拥有非凡能力的人
and special knowledge, like Sherlock Holmes,

349
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,678
当遇到一个极其简单的问题时
it rather encourages him

350
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,814
追求复杂的答案
to seek a complex explanation

351
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,068
才能让他欢欣鼓舞
when a simpler one is at hand.

352
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,510
一抓到阮达尔就通知我们
You let us know when Randall is arrested.

353
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,250
可怜的福尔摩斯 你现在一定很郁闷
Poor Holmes, you must feel like an abstruse.

354
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,541
一个有学识的专家
A learned specialist

355
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,919
却被邀请去解决一个豆大点的事
calling for a case of measles

356
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,359
很烦人吧
Annoying.

357
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,703
我们必须得回去
We must return.

358
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,692
那三个玻璃杯
Three glasses.

359
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,442
华生
Watson,

360
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,921
夫人的美貌
We have been dazzled out of observation

361
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:29,048
影响了我们的判断力
by that lady's beauty,

362
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,366
她美是事实
beauty may be truth

363
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,540
但她没有必要说那件事啊
but she does not necessarily speak it.

364
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,283
三个杯子全沾了酒
There was port in each glass

365
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:39,520
可是只有一个杯子里有渣滓
but there was only crusting in one glass.

366
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,025
倒酒时最后一杯
Last glass filled

367
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:43,211
很可能是有渣滓的
is the one most likely to contain the crusting.

368
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:43,943
没错
I agree.

369
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,161
但前提是倒最后一杯酒时
If the last pouring it

370
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,522
瓶中已所剩无几
had approached the bottom of the bottle

371
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,059
但瓶子中仍还有半瓶
but the bottle was half full

372
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,421
而如果倒之前摇晃过的话
and it had been agitated.

373
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,241
那三杯中都应有渣滓
The crusting was present throughout the port.

374
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,193
那你是怎么想的?
Well what then do you suppose?

375
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,488
其实只用了两个杯子
That only two glasses were used

376
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,777
两个杯子的渣滓
and the drinks of both

377
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,827
都倒在第三个杯子里
were poured into a third

378
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:01,453
所以产生了假象
to give us the false impression

379
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,935
好像有三个人在那儿喝酒
that three people were there.

380
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,633
我明白了
I understand.

381
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:08,873
如果我的推测没错 华生
If I'm right Watson then in an instant

382
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:12,561
这个案件立刻变成
this case rises from the common place

383
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:15,872
一件很不寻常的案子
to the exceeding and remarkable.

384
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:18,455
那应该就是去肯特郡的火车了
That would be the Kent train.

385
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:21,416
哪里?      那里
What way?        That way.

386
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,570
你听到火车声了?
How on earth did you hear it?

387
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:30,250
我什么也没听到 华生
I heard nothing Watson,

388
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,445
我观察得来的
I observed.

389
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:35,476
荒废了一个早晨后
Salutary thought

390
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:38,369
该好好思考了
after such a misspent morning.

391
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,034
布莱肯斯特尔夫人和她的女仆
Lady Brackenstall and her maid

392
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,470
掩护罪犯
must have some very good reason

393
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:43,871
一定有重大的理由
for shielding the real criminal.

394
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,862
好了 华生
Well Watson,

395
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:51,466
我们得靠自己
we shall just have to construct our case

396
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:54,695
设法弄清当时的情况
for ourselves without depth.

397
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,658
快去格兰其庄园
The Abbey Grange as fast as you can.

398
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,514
华生
Watson.

399
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:50,104
看来斯坦莱・霍普金
Well it appears that Inspector Hopkins

400
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,978
已经去总部汇报
has gone to report to headquarters.

401
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,787
太好了 我们可以采取主动了
Splendid, then we can take possession.

402
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:08,374
对于辛苦劳作的人
How many frustrated episodes

403
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:09,949
在这块布满废铁的坟地上
for the laboring men here

404
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,552
重建家园
could one reconstruct

405
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,056
要经历多少苦难啊?
from this mechanical cemetery?

406
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,137
那是什么
What's this?

407
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,512
华生?
Watson?

408
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:29,064
看起来似乎不完整
Not entirely mechanical it seems.

409
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:48,102
法吉
Fudge.

410
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,213
愿灵魂安息
Requiescat in pace.

411
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,184
我认为这应该是宠物的墓碑
I imagine it's a pet's gravestone.

412
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,791
它已经被打碎过了
It has been smashed.

413
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:07,082
然后被修补 接着再被打碎
Mended and smashed again

414
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,441
这是有意为之
with deliberate force.

415
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,555
它告诉了我们发生在不久之前的事件
The story it tells is of the immediate past.

416
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:25,883
华生?
Watson?

417
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:31,178
一块残缺的狗项圈
The remnants of a dog's collar.

418
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,155
法吉
Fudge.

419
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,684
嗨 你
Hey you!

420
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,562
在上个月里 这个庄园有没有
Has any servant been dismissed from the house

421
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,169
一位仆人被辞退?
in the last month?

422
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:43,089
没有 先生
No sir.

423
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:44,933
那么就和我想象的一样
Then it's as I thought.

424
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,560
法吉
Fudge.

425
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,529
布莱肯斯特尔夫人的宠物狗
Lady Brackenstall's pet dog,

426
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:55,414
让我们猜想一下 死亡
let us imagine, dies.

427
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:57,365
一定不难想象
It may not be too fanciful to suggest

428
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:58,995
这个可怜的不幸的动物
that the poor unfortunate creature

429
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,702
是被谋杀的
was literally killed.

430
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:01,851
被谋杀?
Killed?

431
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:03,036
因为什么
For what reason?

432
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:04,612
我认为原因是很难猜到的
Reason I suggest hardly entered into it.

433
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,629
应该源于一场能够称为疯狂虐杀的事件
It was done in a fit of insane rage.

434
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:07,569
被谁?
By whom?

435
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:09,481
一个酒鬼 一个残酷成性的恶棍
By a drunkard, sadistic ruffian.

436
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,590
其中一个凶手?
One of the murderers?

437
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:12,582
不 华生
No Watson.

438
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:15,160
那位夫人的丈夫
The lady's husband.

439
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:17,109
布莱肯斯特尔的最后一代
The last of the Brackenstall's.

440
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,502
布莱肯斯特尔
Brackenstall.

441
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:20,380
你想想
Consider it.

442
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:21,986
除了这个家的主人 没有人
No one but a member of the household

443
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:23,518
可以破坏墓碑
could vandalize a gravestone

444
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,331
还把它留在原地
and it remain in place.

445
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,559
我有些困惑为什么
Why should Brackenstall

446
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:30,335
布莱肯斯特尔先生要这么对待
entertain such an obsession

447
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,768
一只宠物 似乎他再也
about a pet animal

448
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,789
不愿意留下任何关于它的回忆
that he would forbid any remembrance of it?

449
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:35,915
你也看到了那位夫人胳膊上的伤痕了
You saw the marks of course on the lady's arm.

450
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:37,411
是的 我很惊讶
Yes I was surprised

451
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:38,800
那没有引起你过多的兴趣
that it did not interest you more.

452
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:40,300
那些伤口应该是
They were stab wounds

453
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,257
长缝衣针或者帽针造成的
made by a long needle or a hatpin.

454
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,501
这位夫人已经生活在对自己
This lady has been living in fear

455
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,980
人身安全的恐惧中很长时间了 华生
of her physical safety Watson.

456
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,336
小心点 福尔摩斯
Take care Holmes.

457
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,922
华生
Watson?

458
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:15,112
我们的案子解决了
We have got our case.

459
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:18,874
我差点犯了个最严重的错误
Highly likely, the blunder of a lifetime.

460
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:22,561
但是现在整个谋杀过程就快完整了
But now the chain is almost complete.

461
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:23,962
你弄清哪些人是罪犯了?
You got your men?

462
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,561
是一个罪犯 华生
Man, Watson, man.

463
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,782
只有一个罪犯
Only one,

464
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:33,462
但是是个非常难对付的人
but a remarkable person.

465
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:35,799
他健壮得像头狮子 灵活得像只松鼠
Strong as a lion, active as a squirrel,

466
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,096
他的手很灵巧 而且
dexterous with his fingers and finally,

467
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:40,644
他的头脑也异常地聪明
remarkably quick-witted.

468
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:48,026
啊 布莱肯斯特尔夫人
Awe, Lady Brackenstall.

469
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:49,722
我不希望给您造成
I do not wish to cause you

470
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,609
不必要的苦恼
any unnecessary trouble,

471
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,215
我的愿望是让事情
my whole desire

472
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,532
更快解决让你摆脱痛苦
is to make things easier for you.

473
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,031
我知道您已经遭受了很多的磨难
I am convinced that you are a much-tried woman.

474
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,158
如果您愿意把我当做
If you will trust me

475
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,664
朋友一样地信任
and treat me as a friend,

476
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:10,930
您会发现我不会辜负您的诚意
you may find that I will justify that trust.

477
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,326
你要我做什么呢
What do you want me to do?

478
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:13,648
告诉我真实的情况
To tell me the truth.

479
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:14,830
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes!

480
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,342
不不不不 布莱肯斯特尔夫人
No, no, no, no please, Lady Brackenstall,

481
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:20,574
掩盖是没有用的
it is of no use.

482
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:22,043
你也许听过我
You may have heard of

483
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:23,433
所享有的小名声
a little reputation that I may possess,

484
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,005
我用我的名誉担保
I will stake it all on the fact

485
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,987
你所讲的完全是编造的
that your story is a complete fabrication.

486
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,686
你是个无耻的家伙
You're an impudent fellow.

487
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:32,447
你是不是说我的女主人撒谎了
You try to say that my mistress has told a lie?

488
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,261
你没有什么要和我说的了吗
Have you nothing to tell me?

489
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,879
我全说了
I have told you everything.

490
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,454
布莱肯斯特尔夫人 再想一想
Now think just once more, Lady Brackenstall.

491
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:43,528
坦率一些不是更好吗
Wouldn't it be better to be frank?

492
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:47,079
我知道的都说了
I have told you all I know.

493
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:53,802
对不起
I am sorry.

494
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,455
铃绳给了我们提示
The bell rope gave us the clue,

495
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:06,996
我的推论绝对没错
which should have left us in no doubt.

496
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,209
到底怎么一回事呢
How is that?

497
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,749
华生 如果你想把铃绳拉下来
If you were to pull down a bell rope, Watson,

498
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,446
你认为绳子应当从哪儿断呢
where would you expect it to break?

499
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:12,916
当然是在最上面
Surely at the top

500
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,614
与铁丝相接的地方
where it is attached to the wire.

501
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,320
而不是离铁丝三英寸的地方
Not three inches from the top.

502
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:17,577
但是绳子是磨损的
But the rope was frayed.

503
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,016
那个绑住夫人的绳子是被磨损的
The rope, which held Lady Brackenstall, was frayed.

504
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:22,074
这人很狡猾 用刀子故意磨损绳子的一头
He was cunning enough to do that with his knife.

505
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:23,985
可是另外一头没有磨损
But the other end was not.

506
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,901
如果你像我一样从壁炉架上看
If you would have stood on the mantelpiece as I did

507
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:28,933
你会看到另一头切得很平 没有磨损痕迹
you would have seen that it was cut through.

508
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,038
请停下
Stop.

509
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,780
马夫
Please driver.

510
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:48,048
华生
Watson?

511
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:53,378
这个圆木从今天早上就没有移动过
That log has not moved since early this morning.

512
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,325
有东西阻碍了它移动
Well perhaps it's snagged on something.

513
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,893
抑或是它被固定了
Or anchored.

514
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,519
保证霍普金会在他回来
See that Inspector Hopkins

515
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,654
的路上拿到这个 明白吗
gets this on his return, will you?

516
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,422
车站
Chilehurst station.

517
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,507
现在要去哪 福尔摩斯
Where to now Holmes?

518
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:28,260
跨南航线的海运公司的办公室
The shipping office of the Southern Cross Line.

519
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:30,523
对 当然了
Yes, yes of course.

520
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:33,797
跨南航线
The Southern Cross Line

521
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,228
主要承运从阿得雷德
is the principal passenger carrier

522
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,938
到伦敦的客人
between Adelaide and London.

523
00:29:38,018 --> 00:29:41,175
哦 我懂了
Ah, I see.

524
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,556
那年五月
In May of that year,

525
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,918
只有一条航船到了英国港口
only one of ours reached the home port,

526
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,570
这条船叫"直布罗陀磐石"号
our flagship the Rock of Gibraltar.

527
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:02,111
我会把乘客名单给你的
I'll have the passenger list sent up.

528
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,347
福尔摩斯先生究竟是怎么知道的?
How on earth did Mr. Holmes know that?

529
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:20,879
哦  找到了
Awe, here we are.

530
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,774
阿得雷德的玛丽・弗莱泽夫人 头等舱
Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide, first class,

531
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,406
她的女仆在旁陪同
accompanied by her maid.

532
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,707
直布罗陀磐石号现在在哪
Where is the Rock of Gibraltar now?

533
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,175
我去查查就知道了
I'll know today.

534
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:31,672
福尔摩斯先生 她现在
She was steaming west

535
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,215
正向西通过阿拉伯海湾 
through the Arabian Gulf, Mr. Holmes,

536
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:37,729
前往苏伊士运河
heading for Suez, I hope.

537
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,906
你们的政策是
Is it your policy

538
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:45,627
经常调整船与船之间的人手的吗
to transfer officers much between ship and ship?

539
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,203
不是 恰恰相反
No not at all.

540
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:50,268
我们的政策是尽量不要这样
It is our policy not to.

541
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,852
哦 我明白你的意思了 先生
Awe, I have you, Mr. Holmes.

542
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,587
你想问我在这艘船上
You are asking the whereabouts

543
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:57,365
工作的某个船员
of a member of the crew of the Rock

544
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,628
常常在这艘船上工作
who has been seen very recently

545
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:01,236
但是此次却不在船上的船员
but not on the ship.

546
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:04,915
先生 你的理解能力真让我惊讶
Mr. Viviali, your precocity astonishes me.

547
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:07,777
我要告诉你 我是看了
I assure you it is only through study of

548
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:10,452
您这位好医生所描写您工作的精彩故事
the good doctor's masterly exposition of your work

549
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,799
才学会了您推理能力的一点皮毛
that I now have any small capacity to reason.

550
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:15,195
真的?
Really?

551
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:17,490
真让我惊奇
You amaze me.

552
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:20,347
华生 你不做笔记吗
Watson are you taking notes?

553
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:26,128
还有 您会非常高兴地听到
Also, you will be pleased to hear

554
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:30,135
我知道您要找的人是谁
that I know exactly who the officer is.

555
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,403
哦 太棒了
Awe, excellent,

556
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,137
布贝吉太太
Mrs. Burbage,

557
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:40,234
太棒了
excellent.

558
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:41,930
是的 各位先生
Yes gentlemen,

559
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:44,160
现在唯一是这艘船的船员
the only officer from that voyage of the Rock

560
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:46,224
却不在这艘船上的人
who is not aboard her now,

561
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:47,956
是杰克・克洛克
is Jack Croker,

562
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,566
一位出色的小伙子
a magnificent chap.

563
00:31:49,637 --> 00:31:52,141
难道我说得不对吗 布贝吉太太
Am I not correct Mrs. Burbage?

564
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,073
克洛克有个缺点
Croker has a defect.

565
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,162
他是个讨人喜的同事
A delightful fellow.

566
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,586
帅气得就像一个王子
Handsome as a prince.

567
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:05,130
船员崇拜他
The crew worship him.

568
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:07,077
我们也将他提升为我们的
And we've promoted him to captain

569
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,956
新船"巴斯磐石"号的船长
of our new vessel the Bass Rock.

570
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:10,623
不用给我沏茶了
No tea for me please.

571
00:32:10,704 --> 00:32:13,278
这是艘刚刚装修好的新船
Which is just fitting out.

572
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,296
他是我们最年轻的船长
He's the youngest captain we have

573
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,909
但是将会是最好的
but he'll be the best.

574
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:21,911
没有任何一个船长可以比得上他
Not an officer in the fleet to touch him.

575
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:27,729
他性情急噪
He is hot headed

576
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,389
容易激动
and excitable

577
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:30,576
但是忠诚
but loyal,

578
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,973
诚实
honest

579
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,623
而且是个热心肠
and kind-hearted.

580
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,641
有些时候在你的生命里
Sometimes in this life

581
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,447
你遇到了那种
you meet people who are,

582
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:42,275
你也许会叫做 拥有大智慧
what you might call, large-souled,

583
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:45,548
来自上天恩典的人
who are a privilege to know.

584
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:47,680
克洛克就是这样的人
Croker is one of those.

585
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:01,569
在我的工作中曾经有一两次
Once or twice in my career

586
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,521
由于我查出罪犯而造成的害处
I feel I've done more real harm

587
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:05,255
要比犯罪事件本身
about my discovery of the criminal

588
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:08,220
所造成的害处更大
than ever he had done by his crime.

589
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:14,109
我现在已经懂得需要谨慎
But I've learned caution now,

590
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:16,471
我最好是哄骗一下
and I'd rather play tricks

591
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,079
英国的法律
with the law of England

592
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:20,168
而不是我的良心
than with my own conscience.

593
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:39,562
船长克洛克
Captain Croker,

594
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,924
请坐
sit down.

595
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,391
我收到了你的电报
I've got your telegram,

596
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,482
并且按照你的要求准时来了
and I've come at the hour you said.

597
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,224
我听说你去过办公室
I heard you've been down to the office.

598
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:51,816
我是无法从你手里逃脱了?
There's no getting away from you is there?

599
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,172
大声说出来啊 
Speak up, man.

600
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:54,602
你不能站在那里
You can't stand there

601
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:56,170
和我玩猫捉老鼠的把戏啊
and play cat and mouse with me!

602
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,560
你到底知道什么了
What do you know?

603
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,225
华生 能给他一支雪茄吗
Would you give him a cigar, Watson?

604
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,146
拜托
Please.

605
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,652
克洛克船长 抽抽烟
Bite on that,Captain Croker,

606
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:12,422
你要控制住自己的感情
and try not to let your nerves run away with you.

607
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:14,793
如果我把你当成罪犯 我就不会
I shall not sit here smoking with you

608
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,470
坐在这儿和你一起抽烟了
if I thought you were a common criminal.

609
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:24,053
告诉我
Tell me

610
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:27,088
你是用什么来
what did you use

611
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:29,869
让银器被固定在漂浮的圆木上的呢
to secure the silver to the floating log?

612
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,382
我猜想是用猎枪室的鱼线
My guess it's was fishing gut from the gun-room

613
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:34,745
但是银器被取出来时我不在现场
but I was not present at its recovery.

614
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,591
我说的对吗
Am I right?

615
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:37,949
你想要得到什么
What do you want?

616
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:41,149
正义
Justice.

617
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,475
为谁?
For whom?

618
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:44,249
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

619
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:48,009
我们只是想看到正义得以伸张
We just want to see justice done that is all.

620
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,417
很好
Very well.

621
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:56,085
是鱼线吗
Was it fishing gut?

622
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,324
不 是麻线
No, twine.

623
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,139
这是一个年轻水手
It was a throw back to the days 

624
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:02,984
必须要掌握的东西
before the master as a youngster.

625
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:05,531
甚至现在我都会随身带着一枚银币
Even now I always carry a silver coin

626
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,921
和长麻线
and length twine...

627
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:09,668
还有一把多用小刀?
And a multiplex knife?

628
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:17,262
你到底是怎么知道的
How in the devil do you know that?

629
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,403
你到底是谁
Who are you?

630
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,011
现在
Now,

631
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,001
对我老老实实地讲讲
give me a true account of everything

632
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:34,701
昨晚在格兰其庄园发生的事
that happened at the Abbey Grange last night.

633
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,835
你对我坦白 我们还可以好好谈谈
Be frank with me and we may do some good.

634
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,234
对我耍花招的话
Play tricks with me

635
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,850
我就毁了你
and I'll crush you.

636
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,831
那我就豁出去了
I'll chance it.

637
00:35:57,904 --> 00:35:59,114
但是有一点我要先说清楚
But one thing I'll say first,

638
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,258
我毫不后悔
I regret nothing,

639
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,586
也不害怕
I fear nothing

640
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,802
如果再遇到一次 我还会这样做
and I'd do it all again if I had to

641
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:05,030
并且以此自豪 那个该死的家伙
and be proud of the job, damn the man!

642
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:08,589
但只有我 是我一个人干的
Well that's my side of things, only my side.

643
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:10,215
当我想到玛丽
When I think of Mary,

644
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:11,828
亲爱的玛丽・弗莱泽
sweet Mary Fraser,

645
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,359
一想到我使她
I think of getting her

646
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,821
陷入了困境
into this bloody business,

647
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:16,106
我就心神不安
it's that, that turns my soul to water.

648
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,288
我是在上一艘船上见到她的
I met her when I was first officer

649
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,621
那时候我是大副
on my last ship.

650
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,086
我要休息
Air.

651
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:56,569
哦 我得休息一下 克洛克先生
Oh I need air, Mr. Croker.

652
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:59,351
我从来没有这么跳过舞
I've never danced so much in my life.

653
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,757
你天生就是个舞者 弗莱泽小姐
You dance if you were born to Miss Fraser.

654
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,204
我保证 这既不是天生的也不是后天培养
Neither born nor bred, I assure Mr. Croker.

655
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:08,792
我想是因为我有个更会跳舞的舞伴
Led to it, I think, by a better dancer than I am.

656
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,741
她对待我就和
She treated me as fairly

657
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:12,834
一般的女人对男人那样
as ever a woman treated a man.

658
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,434
我们从来没有订过婚
We were never engaged.

659
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,975
我并没有怨言
I have no complaints.

660
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:22,407
我只是一厢情愿地爱着她
But it was all love on my side

661
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:27,002
她只是把我当朋友看待
and all-good comradeship and friendship on hers.

662
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,702
当我们分开的时候
When we parted

663
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:31,002
她仍无所牵挂
she was a free woman

664
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:37,590
我却再也不是个了无牵挂的人
but I could never again be a free man.

665
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:51,062
当我再次航海归来的时候
Next time I came back from the sea

666
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,400
我听说她结婚了
I read of her marriage.

667
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,983
这似乎是她本应就该得到的
It seemed to be the sort of thing she was made for.

668
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,611
我并不悲伤
I didn't grieve.

669
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,770
相反我觉得很高兴
I felt it to be right.

670
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:09,613
我没想到还会再遇到她
So I never thought to see her again.

671
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:13,797
上次航行以后我被提升
At last voyage I was promoted,

672
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,608
而新船还没下海
and the new boat was not yet launched,

673
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,239
所以我要和我的水手们
so I had to wait for a couple of months

674
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:20,170
在肯特等两个月
with my people in Kent.

675
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:25,257
我知道她在那 可是我没有去见她
I knew now where she was but stayed away.

676
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,736
有一天我遇到了梯芮萨・瑞特
Then I met Theresa Wright one day

677
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,411
她告诉了我关于她的一切
and she told me all about her,

678
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:34,200
包括那段婚姻
about the marriage,

679
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,153
她残酷的醉鬼丈夫
about the man's drunken cruelty,

680
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,758
以及所有的事
about everything.

681
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,683
你们知道那位崇高的男爵
Do you know this noble baron

682
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,294
烧掉了她的宠物
had burnt her pet dog

683
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:47,889
还威胁她吗
and threatened as much to her?

684
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:50,812
先生们 我告诉你们
I tell you gentlemen,

685
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:54,889
这简直要让我气疯了
it nearly drove me mad.

686
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:58,155
我确实见到了玛丽
I did meet Mary

687
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,499
之后我又见了她一次
and I met her again.

688
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:04,498
最后
At last,

689
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,278
她不想再见我了
she would meet me no more.

690
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,804
接着我接到通知
I was then given notice

691
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:14,424
要在一周内出海
that I would leave of my voyage within the week.

692
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,904
你疯了
You're mad.

693
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,803
你怎么能来这呢
How could you come here?

694
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:10,074
我马上就要离开了 玛丽
I'm to go away Mary.

695
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:14,669
他们给了我艘船
I've been given a ship.

696
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:19,373
我马上就走了 我想向你道别
To go and not say farewell.

697
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:21,806
我也许再也没法见到你了
I thought I might never see you again.

698
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:25,394
你要走了?
You're going away?

699
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:29,361
我一点也不为此开心
I do not relish it.

700
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:34,723
你会是个好船长的
You'll make a fine captain.

701
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,389
你千万不要错过
You must not let anything

702
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,240
这个大好机会
spoil such an opportunity.

703
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:47,464
我对你是有感情的
I feel for you.

704
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:51,057
可你无能为力
You can do nothing.

705
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,572
这是最让我伤心的事情
However, it is which hurts most stunning.

706
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,658
我觉得我这几周
I believe I should have gone mad

707
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:01,391
都快要疯了
these past few weeks.

708
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:06,411
玛丽?
Lf... Mary?

709
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:09,550
如果我没有这么想你
If it had not been for the thought of you,

710
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,937
我的朋友
my friend.

711
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,616
好吧
Alright.

712
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:19,882
是朋友就好 玛丽
Friend will do, Mary.

713
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,552
这就是我对你的爱
It is the measure of my love for you

714
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:25,074
它如此强烈 将永存于我的心中
it's so strong it will live on crumbs.

715
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,679
朋友就好
Friend will do.

716
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,422
杰克 你别这么说
Jack don't even say it.

717
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,792
这并不会让我们更开心
It won't make us any happier.

718
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:37,402
你知道我的感觉
You know what I feel.

719
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,351
我知道吗
Do I?

720
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:46,215
你知道的
You know you do.

721
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:50,001
那么我要比我来的时候更喜悦了
Then I shall go a happier man than when I came.

722
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,675
上帝保佑你 亲爱的玛丽・弗莱泽
God Bless you sweet Mary Fraser.

723
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:57,037
这对我来说已经足够
That's enough for me.

724
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,050
我必须走了 杰克
You must not stay Jack.

725
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:37,322
看在我的份上 把这个带走吧
Take this for my sake.

726
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:56,477
我终于抓住你们了 夫人
At last I have you madam.

727
00:42:56,552 --> 00:42:59,815
这就是你见不得人的事
At your taint.

728
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:06,400
这就是你该死的端庄的真面目吗
Here's a key to your damn modesty.

729
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:09,014
你还有什么想说的吗 夫人
You have a confession madam?

730
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,140
一个该死的妓女
A damn whore,

731
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:13,121
一个贫穷的贱人
A gutter queen,

732
00:43:13,196 --> 00:43:15,902
一个肮脏的荡妇
A filthy jade.

733
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:24,502
是的 先生
Yes sir.

734
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:25,791
来吧
Come sir.

735
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,902
站在这
Stand you there, sir,

736
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,097
不要管那个该死的妓女了
over the body of your bloody harlot.

737
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:41,702
她没事
She's all right.

738
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:43,616
杰克?
Jack?

739
00:44:43,692 --> 00:44:45,674
哦 杰克
Oh Jack.

740
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,399
谢谢你 船长
Thank you. My captain.

741
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,628
把这个喝了
Now drink this.

742
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:16,135
哦 发生了什么
Oh... oh what happened?

743
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,018
我杀了他
I killed him.

744
00:45:21,296 --> 00:45:23,065
什么?
Are you certain?

745
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,318
我杀了他
I know.

746
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:25,786
我早就想到会有今天了
I felt it.

747
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:28,565
哦 老天
Oh dear God.

748
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,707
我们该怎么办
What are we going to do?

749
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:37,303
听老梯芮萨的话
Listen to your old Theresa.

750
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:39,188
你被打了一拳
You're marked with a blow

751
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,687
这差点要了你的命
that could have killed you,

752
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:44,239
这也许是你解脱的机会
that shall be your salvation.

753
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,150
梯芮萨异常的冷静
Theresa was as cool as ice.

754
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:56,704
这是她和我的密谋
It was her plot as much as mine.

755
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,060
我们必须让一切看起来
We must make it appear

756
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:00,534
好像是强盗做的
the burglars had done the thing.

757
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,914
梯芮萨一再给她的女主人
Theresa kept on repeating 

758
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:02,971
重复我们编造的故事
our story to her mistress,

759
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:04,435
而我爬上去
while I swarmed up

760
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:07,845
切断铃绳
and cut the rope of the bell.

761
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,545
然后我把玛丽绑在椅子上
I then lashed for her in her chair,

762
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:11,015
把绳子的末端弄成磨损的样子
frayed out the end of the rope

763
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,643
来让一切看起来自然些
to make it look natural.

764
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,043
银器的事你们都知道了
The silver well you know about that.

765
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:15,851
是的 那三个装着酒的杯子
I do, and the third glass of port

766
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:17,424
就是为了嫁祸给阮达尔吧?
to tie in with the Randalls?

767
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:18,742
是的
Yes.

768
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,138
然后我们把烛台
And we dropped the candlestick

769
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:21,493
扔在玛丽摔倒的地方
by where Mary fell

770
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,446
这样蜡就会溅到她身上
for the wax would splash on her.

771
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,765
我以为警察永远
I never thought the police

772
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:27,097
不会识破我们的计谋
could have seen through our dodge.

773
00:46:27,176 --> 00:46:29,290
当我知道那个野蛮人已经死了
When I knew that savage fiend was dead

774
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,760
她也可以自由的时候
and she was free of him

775
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,457
我就把那晚看作是我生命中最美的一晚
I reckon I done the best nights work of my life.

776
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:35,173
即使我被绞死我也会做这么做的
I still do even if I swing for it.

777
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:46,879
这就是真相
That is the truth.

778
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:49,008
全部的事实 先生
The whole truth, sir.

779
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:53,773
老天
Dear God.

780
00:46:55,694 --> 00:46:57,746
没错
Yes.

781
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:01,011
是的 你告诉了我们一切
Yes you have told me the truth.

782
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,159
如果那个女仆
And if the lady's maid

783
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,211
能够不要那么节约
had been less abstemious

784
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:05,337
处理了那几个杯子
and accepted your glass of port,

785
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,565
也许你就可以骗过我了
your ingenuity might have fooled me

786
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:12,053
就像你已经骗过了警察那样
as you have certainly fooled the police.

787
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,312
谁把你的方向引向我的
Who put you onto me?

788
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:19,572
你如何找到我的
How on earth did you find me?

789
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,275
只有杂技演员或水手
No one could have gone after that bell rope

790
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,469
才能够到铃绳
but an acrobat or sailor.

791
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,795
只有水手
No one but a sailor

792
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:26,225
会打那把椅子上的
could have made the knots

793
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,209
那种方式的绳结
with which the cord was fastened to the chair.

794
00:47:28,285 --> 00:47:30,338
那位夫人在那种情况下
It was evident that the lady was shielding someone

795
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,106
依旧在庇护别人
to do so under such circumstances

796
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:36,530
说明她爱那个人
meant that she must love the person.

797
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:41,960
把她和她来这国家时
Was that too wild a leap of the imagination

798
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,328
所乘坐的船上的船员联系起来
to connect her with an officer of a ship,

799
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:45,760
也并不是太难 不是么
which brought her to this country?

800
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,259
克洛克
Croker.

801
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:57,145
你在等一个人
You're expecting a visitor.

802
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,238
我有吗?
I am?

803
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:34,050
这位先生知道所有的事
My dearest the gentleman that knows everything.

804
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,670
所以不必对他有所隐瞒
There's no hiding from it.

805
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:38,823
我知道了
I Know.

806
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:41,012
他的电报让我来这的
His telegram brought me here.

807
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:46,443
你有什么打算 福尔摩斯先生
What do you intend, Mr. Holmes?

808
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:48,638
克洛克船长
Well Captain Croker

809
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,737
这是个非常严重的事件
this is a very serious matter.

810
00:48:50,807 --> 00:48:53,479
虽然我非常确定基于你今晚
Yet I feel sure that on the basis of the story,

811
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,157
告诉我的故事
which you have told us here tonight,

812
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,672
大英帝国的法庭会理解
a British court of law will understand

813
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:01,346
你的行为是出于自卫
that you acted in defense of your own life.

814
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:03,541
但是 这一切
That, however,

815
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:05,283
必须要由陪审团决定
is for the jury to decide.

816
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,355
不过
Meanwhile,

817
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:10,681
我非常同情你
I have so much sympathy for you

818
00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:12,778
因此你可以选择在
that if you choose to disappear

819
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,616
24小时内消失
within the next 24-hours

820
00:49:14,694 --> 00:49:18,065
我保证没有人会阻拦你
I promise no one will hinder you.

821
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:21,202
这样就可以没事了?
Then it will all come out?

822
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,185
肯定不会有什么事了
Certainly it will come out.

823
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,037
这算是什么馊主意啊
What sort of proposal is that?

824
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:27,884
玛丽必须要承担所有的后果
Mary would be left to face the music.

825
00:49:27,962 --> 00:49:29,871
甚至作为共犯被拘禁
Held as an accomplice maybe.

826
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:31,855
不 先生 我不会这么做的
No sir, it will not do.

827
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:35,052
杰克 你必须走
Jack you must go.

828
00:49:35,135 --> 00:49:36,795
我不会的
I shall not.

829
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,927
船长 平静下来
Calm yourself Captain.

830
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:41,360
我只是在试探你
I was only testing you.

831
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:44,843
华生 这家伙次次都是说的真话
Watson, this fellow rings true every time.

832
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:47,493
我需要承担
It is a great responsibility

833
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,154
极大的责任
that I take upon myself

834
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,696
但是我们会
but we will do it

835
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:52,322
按照法律程序来解决的
in due form of law.

836
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:53,828
克洛克 你是犯人
Croker, you are the prisoner.

837
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:55,040
华生
Watson?

838
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,776
你是一位英国陪审员
You are a British jury,

839
00:49:59,855 --> 00:50:01,874
我从未见过一个
and I never met any man

840
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:06,218
比你更合适担任陪审员的人了
more eminently fitted to represent one.

841
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:09,289
现在 先生
Now gentle man

842
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:10,915
你已经听取了证词
you have heard the evidence

843
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:13,017
你认为这个犯人有罪还是无罪
do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty.

844
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,191
无罪
Not guilty.

845
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,660
人民的呼声便是上帝的呼声
Vox populi, vox Dei.

846
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:17,264
克洛克船长 你无罪释放了
You are acquitted,Captain Croker.

847
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:23,909
不
No.

848
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:25,374
不 先生你不能这么做
No sir it will not do.

849
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:26,279
船长?
Captain?

850
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,433
如果警察抓了其他可怜的无辜者怎么办
What if the police arrest some other poor devil,

851
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:32,860
怎么办
what then?

852
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:35,082
我就会运用我全部的能力
Then I will use all my powers

853
00:50:35,163 --> 00:50:37,490
来劝说他们相信自己抓错了人
to persuade them of their mistake.

854
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:38,669
如果他们偶然发现了你
If they light on you

855
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,244
那就是另外一回事了
then that is another matter.

856
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:41,870
不过 我认为这不太可能
However, I think that is unlikely.

857
00:50:41,953 --> 00:50:44,836
一年后你再回到这位夫人身边吧
Come back to this lady in a year's time,

858
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:47,453
但愿你和她的未来都能证明
and may her future and yours justify

859
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:49,292
我们今晚作出的
us in the judgment that we

860
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,102
判决是正确的
have pronounced this night.

861
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,985
哦 谢谢你
Oh thank you.

862
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:07,335
夫人 我很好奇
Madam, I'm intrigued,

863
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,840
对于一个可悲的酗酒鬼
you gave such a compelling account

864
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:11,823
你是如何做出如此真实的描述的?
of the man's sad addiction to drink

865
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:13,322
因为据我们所知
and yet it is not as we now know

866
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:15,057
你的丈夫并非如此
portrayed as your husband

867
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:17,463
可你的描述又如此的令人信服
but it was such a clear description I wondered.

868
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:20,495
那是我的父亲
My father.

869
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:23,166
我可怜的父亲 医生
My poor father, Doctor.

870
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:26,347
他正因为这个赶来英国
He's on his way England because of it.

871
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:27,972
正是他的自律
His self-management was the reason

872
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,715
才让我并不害怕我丈夫的恶习
I didn't fear the vice of my husband

873
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,608
因为我们结婚前我就知道这个了
because I knew of it before we were married.

874
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:34,560
我真是个傻瓜
How foolish I was.

875
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:35,881
谢谢你 夫人
Thank you madam.

876
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,533
我非常确定你故事的真实性
I felt sure that your story was true to reality.

877
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:40,681
祝你好运
Good luck to you.

878
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:50,644
你似乎并不太赞成
It's almost as though you disapproved

879
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:53,430
我们今天促成的好事
of the happiness we have fostered this day.

880
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:57,888
不 我赞成你的决定 我当然是赞成的
Oh no, I approve of that, of course I do.

881
00:51:57,964 --> 00:51:59,732
但是你让我
But I'm uneasy

882
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,887
又做律师又做法官的 
that you took upon yourself the duties

883
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:04,153
这对我来说可不容易
of advocate and judge.

884
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,771
华生 你被条条框框束缚住了
You are too bound by forms, Watson.

885
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:10,180
福尔摩斯 社会就是条条框框组成的
Forms are society, Holmes.

886
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,368
人不能没有规矩 福尔摩斯
Manners make a man, Holmes.

887
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:21,354
幸好你是独一无二的
It's just as well you are unique.

888
