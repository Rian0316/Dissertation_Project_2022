Clarify something for me.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,170

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,910
An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,890
It is.
是啊

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,220

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
when you said, "The next person I see talking
边吃边说的人至于死地之后  

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
with food in their mouth will be put to death."

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,740

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
No. Uh-uh. We're good.

73 is the 21st prime number.
73是第21个质数

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,720
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21,
而它反过来说  37是第12个质数  而它再反过来21

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,230
is the product of multiplying--
则是构成73的两个数字

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,830
hang on to your hats-- seven and three.
高潮来了  也就是7和3相乘的结果

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,000
"one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one"
是1-0-0-1-0-0-1

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
which backwards is "one-zero- zero-one-zero zero one"
所以它反过来念是1-0-0-1-0-0-1

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
exactly the same.
两者是一致的

34
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,640
All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."
而把查克·诺里斯的名字反着念是"Sirron Kcuhc"[无意义]

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,850
Just for the record,

I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated.
