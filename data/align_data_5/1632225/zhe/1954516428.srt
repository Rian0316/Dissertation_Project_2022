1
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,400

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,620
Clarify something for me.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,170
Isn't the point of a communal meal

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,670
the exchange of ideas and opinions?

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,910
An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,890
It is.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,220
You just kind of put a damper on things

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
when you said, "The next person I see talking

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
with food in their mouth will be put to death."

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
Well, we could argue about who said what all night long,

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,960
but to set things back on course,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
I will propose a new topic of conversation.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,570
Great.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,790
What is the best number?

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,990
By the way, there's only one correct answer.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,740
5,318,008?

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,180
Wrong.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,540
The best number is 73.

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,030
You're probably wondering why.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
No. Uh-uh. We're good.

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,650
73 is the 21st prime number.

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,720
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21,

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,230
is the product of multiplying--

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,830
hang on to your hats-- seven and three.

25
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,620
Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,860
We get it.

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,040
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

28
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,040

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,310
Chuck Norris wishes.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,000
"one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one"

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
which backwards is "one-zero- zero-one-zero zero one"

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
exactly the same.

34
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,640
All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,850
Just for the record,

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,820
when you enter 5,318,008 on a calculator,

37
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,870
upside-down it spells "boobies""

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,530
Remember when you were wondering

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,150
why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,960
Yeah, I get it now.

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,990
I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,850
Oh, thanks.

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,240
Howard gave it to me.

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,450
It's the cutest thing.

45
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,240
Every time I have dinner with his mom,

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,480
the next day I get jewelry.

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,980
Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape

48
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,060
is not actually based on the shape of a human heart,

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,590
but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,910
Oh, so I spent seventh grade

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,830
dotting my I's with little asses?

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,020
Cool.

53
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,910
Hey, Penny, how's it going?

54
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,350
Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?

55
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,670
My dad's company prints the menus for this place.

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,620
I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated.

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,240
Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em.

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,470
Guess how I got the idea?

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,440
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.

61
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,220
- Hi. - Hey.

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,760
Hoo.

63
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,080
Okay, well, it was good to see you.

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,690
Yeah, you, too.

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
He's really cute. How do you know him?

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,650
Oh, we went out a couple of times.

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,590
I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,220
Does "went out" mean "had intercourse"?

69
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,340
- Yes. - No, no.

70
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,060
But in this case, yes.

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,500
Interesting.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,900
And was it not satisfactory?

73
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,840
No, it was great.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.

75
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,140
Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,140

77
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,020
Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.

78
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,540
It's what I do with Howard.

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,070
I'm much smarter than he is.

80
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,560
But it's important to protect his manhood.

81
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,230
Hoo.

82
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,210
What's the matter?

83
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,020
My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy,

85
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,290
my mouth is dry.

86
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,450
In addition, I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,490
Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?

88
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,840
It's no mystery.

89
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,970
I obviously have the flu

90
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,030
coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.

91
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,030

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,960
Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?

93
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,080
- No. - What happened?

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,810
They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,110
and one of the techs got bit.

96
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,200
Did he get superpowers?

97
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,120
No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

99
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,040
Why?

100
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,500
Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab,

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,980
you kind of want to turn into a superhero.

102
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,590
Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?

103
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,520
Who wouldn't?

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,740
You could zip through a maze in nothing flat,

105
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,420
squeeze through really small holes,

106
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,230
and shut down restaurants in a single bound.

107
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,720
And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man,

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,060
you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Mouse Boy?

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,910
You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

111
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,440
How about "Kid Vermin"?

112
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,470
First of all, if we had superpowers,

113
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,020
I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,640
Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,450
Leonard, settle this.

116
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,880
Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,710
Yeah, Leonard, who?

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,200
12 years after high school, and I'm still at the nerd table.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,450
Aren't you slicing that man's brain a little too thin?

120
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,610
It's too thin if I were making

121
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,490
a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,420
For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.

123
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,620
Well, you're the expert.

124
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,760
If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.

125
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,520
Very well.

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,230
If you die and donate your body to science,

127
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,510
I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.

128
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,990
Thank you.

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,350
Now, if you'll excuse me,

130
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,310
I have to take my temperature.

131
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,930
Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms

132
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,330
in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity?

133
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,630
I did that one summer.

134
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,590
Ah, youth.

135
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,500
No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night,

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,260
so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,110
I'd be happy to create a chart

138
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,390
and participate in a differential diagnosis.

139
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,470
Oh, that sounds like fun.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,990
All right.

141
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,270
What were the symptoms?

142
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,950
Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth

143
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,710
and localized vascular throbbing.

144
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,680
Localized to what region?

145
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,920
Ears and genitalia.

146
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,410
Interesting.

147
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,240
Not body parts that usually team up.

148
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,040
What about environmental factors?

149
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,100
Describe the scene for me.

150
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,170
I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette,

151
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,670
drinking water -- carbonated as it was a special occasion.

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,310
Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello

153
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,380
and I said "hoo."

154
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,170
Who?

155
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,860
Zack.

156
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,710
Then why did you ask?

157
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,610
- Ask what?  - Who.

158
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,240
Zack.

159
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
All right, let's start over.

160
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,700
What did you say when Zack walked in?

161
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,670
- "Hoo".  - Zack.

162
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,930
Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

163
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,640
Because you keep saying "who."

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,860
I'm not saying "hoo" now.

165
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,380
I said "hoo" last night.

166
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,180
And the answer was Zack, correct?

167
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,270
There was no question.

168
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,280
I simply said "hoo."

169
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,550
All right, I think I have enough to go on.

170
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,680
Possible explanations for your symptoms are,

171
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,690
in descending order of likelihood:

172
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,830
hyperthyroidism, premature menopause,

173
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,060
hosting an alien parasite or --

174
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,900
and I only include it for the sake of covering

175
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,640
absolutely all bases -- sexual arousal.

176
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,210
Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?

177
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,760
There you are.

178
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,960
Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,180
I don't know. Um...

180
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,260
nuclear war.

181
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,020
Accidentally being buried alive.

182
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,640
Any of those movies where you get that phone call

183
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,150
that says you're going to die.

184
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,080
And then you do.

185
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,920
No. Something very specific

186
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,170
that we both know you,

187
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,560
Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.

188
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,100
Well, type two diabetes runs in my family.

189
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,960
The thought of losing a toe...

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,610
Spiders! You're afraid of spiders!

191
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,680
What the heck is this?

192
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,260
A jar with a big spider in it, of course.

193
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,970
Bravery test.

194
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,960
First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.

195
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,800
Are you crazy?

196
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,650
Perhaps.

197
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you scared?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,820
No. But it's a stupid test.

199
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Oh, really? What if the Earth was in danger

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,130
and the only way to save it was

201
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,350
to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?

202
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,540
Oh, yeah? What if the Earth was in danger

203
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,250
and the only way to save it was to take a shower

204
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,280
in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?

205
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,470
Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen.

206
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,770
Put your hand in the jar

207
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,090
or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

208
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,030
All right, I will.

209
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,570
How did you get so brave all of a sudden?

210
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,860
It's easy.

211
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
The spider's crawling up your arm.

212
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,130
Get it off! Get it off!

213
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,780
Please, Raj!

214
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,000
Please.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,090
My blood work shows thyroid function normal.

216
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,850
Cortisol levels normal.

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,380
How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?

218
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,800
Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.

219
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
Are you sure?

220
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,960
You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.

221
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,210
I think we need to face the cold, hard truth:

222
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,540
I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.

223
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,040
Hang on. I don't know

224
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,390
that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis

225
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,200
a fair shake.

226
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,790
Let's look at this logically.

227
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,820
I have a stomach; I get hungry.

228
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,680
I have genitals; I have the potential for sexual arousal.

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,150
A cross we all must bear.

230
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,040
You know, in difficult moments like this,

231
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,070
I often turn to a force greater than myself.

232
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,840
Religion?

233
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,370
Star Trek.

234
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,450
Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

235
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,130
- No. Don't. - It's terrible. However...

236
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,670
in it, we learn that

237
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,850
when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic

238
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,780
by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them

239
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,990
using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

240
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,530
Are you suggesting we live our lives

241
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,200
guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?

242
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,530
"Cheap science fiction"?

243
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,880
What are you doing?

244
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,600
Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.

245
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,630
Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment

246
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,050
is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?

247
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,080
I hadn't considered that.

248
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,240
Give me a moment.

249
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,870
All right, I've considered it.

250
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,370
- And? - I reject it.

251
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,200
You reject it because you don't feel jealousy,

252
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,810
or because you are suppressing jealousy?

253
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,520
I think I'll eat my lunch at home.

254
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,700
That's not your lunch, Sheldon;

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,080
those are the cadaver brain specimens.

256
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,250
As they were incorrectly sliced,

257
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,720
you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.

258
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,270
- Hello. - Hey.

259
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,660
Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?

260
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,970
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener.

261
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,410
If this one under-or over-softens,

262
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,740
I'll need time to make things right.

263
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,170
That's thinking ahead.

264
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,360
The alternative would be to think backwards.

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
That's just remembering.

266
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,280
So how's Amy?

267
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,470
Amy's changed.

268
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,700
I might have to let her go.

269
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,600
Oh, no. Why?

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,100
I thought she was a highly evolved creature

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,560
of pure intellect, like me.

272
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
But recent events indicate that

273
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,960
she may be a slave to her baser urges.

274
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,000
Like you.

275
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,320
Just going to skip over that insult.

276
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,180
What insult?

277
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,340
Yeah! That's why I'm going to skip over it.

278
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,090
Are you saying that Amy is...

279
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,280
oh, what's the scientific word...

280
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,610
Forget science. She's horny.

281
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,550
Oh! Okay. Wow.

282
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,700
It's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.

283
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,630
Are you sure?

284
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,560
What are you suggesting?

285
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,340
I'm suggesting there might be something

286
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,980
you could do about... Amy's urges?

287
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,950
It's illegal to spay a human being.

288
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,670
Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.

289
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,780
You mean... something I could do.

290
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,300
Exactly.

291
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,770
Well, I was hoping to avoid this.

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,680
But I might as well get it over with.

293
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,450
Thank you, Penny.

294
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll let you know what happens.

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,630
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

296
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,300
Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

297
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,350
Is this the Zack Johnson

298
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,780
who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny?

299
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,000
Sorry to bother you.

300
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,970
Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson

301
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,500
who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny.

302
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,000
Coitus. It means intercourse.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,820
And I have a feeling I'm speaking to the right Zack.

304
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,750
This is Sheldon Cooper.

305
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,860
Fine. Shelly.

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,420
Yes, that does sound like a girl's name.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,590
No, it doesn't bother me.

308
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,830
Yes, "Smelly Shelly" does bother me.

309
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,370
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

310
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,310
I'd like to know if you'd be interested

311
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,540
in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler.

312
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,980
Amy Farrah Fowler.

313
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,730
Yes, that is a girl's name.

314
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,510
Good grief. It's like trying to talk to a dolphin.

315
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,700
Really?

316
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,910
This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick?

317
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,580
You got a better idea?

318
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,930
Every idea is better than this idea.

319
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,050
Ding!

320
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,590
- Wait. What the hell is "ding"?  - It's a bell.

321
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,020
I don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell.

322
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Fine. How do you want to start?

323
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,690
I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?

324
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,920
One-two-three-go? That's for babies.

325
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,110
Okay, how about, uh...

326
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,530
on your mark, get set, go?

327
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,220
That's for a footrace. If you want to race,

328
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,150
we have to go outside.

329
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,860
No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.

330
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,950
Oh, for crying out loud.

331
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,120
What kind of superhero needs a jacket?

332
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,860
What kind of superhero says, "Dibs on the red tights!

333
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,500
Dibs on the red tights!"

334
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,010
All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.

335
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,930
Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say

336
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,780
- when we do start, or...  - We're starting now!

337
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,450
Don't yell at me!

338
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,620
Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night.

339
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,760
None come to mind.

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,740
Look at this stamp. On what authority

341
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,460
are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?

342
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm sure it'll wash off.

343
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,340
Little comfort tonight.

344
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,320
I look like a Hell's Angel.

345
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,430
There's Zack.

346
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,490
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

347
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,510
It's not what I want to do;

348
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,780
it's what I have to do.

349
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,870
Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

350
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,870
Follow your endocrine system.

351
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,150
Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.

352
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,130
Please don't drag this out.

353
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,450
This is never going to come off.

354
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,720
Excuse me?

355
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,480
Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night.

356
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,040
I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge.

357
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,320
Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason

358
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,930
And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen,

359
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,230
longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus

360
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,720
and make Shakespeare's metaphorical

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
beast with two backs.

362
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,120
My gluteus what?

363
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,070
On the other hand,

364
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,280
as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face,

365
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,620

366
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,620
I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

367
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
- Good-bye, Zack. - Bye.

368
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,830
Hoo.

369
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,420
That should hold me for a while.

370
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm legally obligated to inform you

371
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,110
that I took a karate lesson when I was 11.

372
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,640
I'd be a regular ninja by now

373
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,350
if my mom could've arranged a carpool.

374
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Oh, yeah?

375
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
Well, I've been taking Pilates class at the rec center,

376
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,410
and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.

377
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,050
Oh, yeah? Won't matter, you're going down!

378
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,740
No, uh-uh, you're going down!

379
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,280
If anybody's going to go down, it's going to be you.

380
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,540
Fellas. It's been 30 minutes. Nobody's touched each other.

381
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,010
I'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain

382
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,520
and return to the realm of pure intellect.

383
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,930
As am I.

384
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,280
What are you doing?

385
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,260
An experiment.

386
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,660
Nope. Nothing. Never mind.

387
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,820
You realize you can't win.

388
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,960
I prefer to think that I can't lose.

389
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,620
You're wrong.

390
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,710
It's only a matter of time

391
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,220
before you fall into Rat-Man's rat trap.

392
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,240
You pathetic fool!

393
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,970
If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

394
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,730
Just because I didn't express myself well

395
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,000
doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid!

396
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,300
You bloviating buffoon!

397
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,330
You narcissistic nincompoop!

398
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,250
You crimson coward!

399
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,160
Oh, Leonard, wake up,

400
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,270
you're missing some very excellent superhero quips.
