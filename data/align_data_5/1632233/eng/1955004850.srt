1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Morning.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,010
Morning.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,940
(exhales)

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,010
- Sleep okay?
- Um uh.  Great!

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,010
Hey, can I ask you something?

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,230
Sure.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,190
Last night, me wanting to try
that stuff out of the Kama Sutra.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,160
Was that fun for you
or kinda racially insensitive?

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,950
Yes. Just because you're in bed
with an India woman

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,430
you think that gives you permission

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,550
to use crazy positions
from an ancient Indian love manual.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,190
Hey, if you can find a book
called "Weird Sex with White Boys"

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,470
I'd be okay with that.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,690
(laughing)

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,670
No, no, you know you have such
beautiful eyes.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,900
Have you ever thought about
getting contacts?

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,800
I tried in the seventh grade.
I could never get used to them.

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,030
Oh. That's too bad.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,760
Yeah. If I had contacts,
I would have been the coolest

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,790
Debate Club president ever to be
stuffed into his own cello case.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,770
If you had them on now, you could
see what we're going to do next.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,240
That-That's okay.
I can infer from context.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,420
Hey, Raj, you wanna see a new
magic trick I been working on?

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
Eh, Howard.

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,740
If I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,580
Is working on magic tricks, really
how you want to spend your time?

27
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,380
Uh, granted,
you're just an engineer, but...

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,860
That doesn't mean you might
not someday build a geegaw

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,090
or a thingamabob that

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,660
that may get you a "thank you" in someone
else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
Is the trick making him disappear?

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,180
Sure, let's see it.

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,080
Here.
Shuffle these.

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,310
Okay.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,340
Now spread them out on the table.
Face down.

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,330
Pick one.
Look at it.

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,550
Okay.

38
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,550
Now remember your card.
Put it back in the deck.

39
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,480
Is it any wonder
he doesn't have a doctorate?

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,430
Now remind me,
what's your birthday?

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,650
October sixth.

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,100
Okay, October is the tenth month.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,660
So 10-- one plus zero
is one plus six is seven.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,880
Turn over the seventh card.

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,740
How about that!

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,960
But, is that your card?

47
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,470
Yes. It is.
Very cool!

48
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,190
Oh it's not cool.

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,080
It's a childish trick, designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,300
How'd you do it?

51
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,350
A magician never reveals his secrets.

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,200
But surely a future
Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

53
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,650
Fine.

54
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,870
Give me a second.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,910
You ever notice when he thinks
real hard it smells like bacon?

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,950
- Oh hey!
- Sorry! Oop!

57
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,810

One, two,

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,780
three, four, five.

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,630
No way.

71
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,610
That's your card, right?

72
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,110
Seven of clubs!

73
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,480
That is amazing!

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,820
It's not amazing.

75
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,460
All magic tricks are merely
a combination

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,160
of manipulation
and misdirection

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,790
with the occasional dwarf in
a box wiggling his feet.

78
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,760
Oh, really?
So how did I do it?

79
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,370
I don't care how you did it.

80
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,140
I have more important things
to think about.

81
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,010
Clearly, the cards
are marked.

82
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,380
I thought you had more important
things to think about.

83
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,150
I do.
You just happened

84
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,050
to have caught me
on a break.

85
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,790
Oh, let me see
those cards.

86
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,120
Big deal. Not knowing

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,660
is part of the fun.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,530
"Not knowing is part
of the fun."

89
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,490
Was that the motto
of your community college?

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,970
Hey, guys,
what do you think?

91
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,430
Priya took me
clothes shopping.

92
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,650
Hey, you look great.

93
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,800
Good for you, Priya.

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,770
I could never get that stupid
hoodie off him

95
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,740
when we were...

96
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,870
Well, you look great.

97
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,310
Thank you.

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,940
Lets go hang
everything up.

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, good.

100
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,650
New contacts.

101
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,980
I should have done this
years ago.

102
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,520
So you finally getting used to
them doing it on a daily basis?

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm not going out with him.

104
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,130
He can sleep
with whoever he wants.

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,860
Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

106
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Oopsy.

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,940
This deck is rigged in
some fashion.

108
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,900
Fine. Get another deck

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,240
and I'll do
the trick with that.

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
So you're saying this is
a regulation deck?

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,740
I'm saying believe in magic,
you muggle.

112
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,220
You know, well, I'm happy
Leonard's found someone.

113
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,790
Not that anybody asked.

114
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,990
How many <i>Star Trek</i> uniforms
do you have?

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,380
Just two:

116
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,870
everyday and dress.

117
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,530
Uh-huh.

118
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,700
Listen, we need
to talk about something.

119
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,840
Oh, my God, you're breaking up
with me!

120
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,110
Why would you take me out
shopping

121
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,540
and then break up with me?
That is so cruel!

122
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,450
Leonard, I'm not breaking up
with you.

123
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,400
Oh, okay.

124
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,240
So, what's up?

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
It's a little weird,

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,730
your ex-girlfriend hanging out
here all the time.

127
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,830
I know.

128
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,400
I usually never see
my ex-girlfriends,

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,830
unless their hard drives crash.

130
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm just saying, how would you
feel if I was hanging out

131
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,670
with my ex-boyfriend?

132
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,110
Um, not great, I guess.

133
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,970
But Penny and I are
just friends.

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,340
I don't care.

135
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,210
This is a woman you have
slept with.

136
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,600
If you want her around,

137
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,920
then I have to wonder if maybe
you're not ready to move on.

138
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,630
No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

139
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,150
I gave up the gift of
sight for you.

140
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,790
If that's not moving on,
what is?

141
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,060
You need to cut the cord
with Penny.

142
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,430
Oh... okay.

143
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,760
You don't sound very confident.

144
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
No, no, I'm confident.

145
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,800
Its not like I'm unfamiliar with
the "get lost" conversation.

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,940
Although, this will be the first
time I'll be the one saying it.

147
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,110
Thank you.

148
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,440
I appreciate it.

149
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,710
Sure.

150
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,180
Oh, God, you
smell so good.

151
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,210
Of course, that
could just be

152
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,130
my other senses
getting stronger.

153
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,190
Hypothetically, if I had access

154
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,790
to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?

155
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,030
Leonard, it is a source
of great pain

156
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,160
to me and my family

157
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,330
that my brother has that outfit
in his wardrobe.

158
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,830
Can we not discuss it?

159
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm sorry. Never mind.

160
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,540
And was your card the jack
of diamonds?

161
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,950
Oh, unbelievable!

162
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,620
Know how he did it yet?

163
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,160
Um...

164
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,360
Aw, he has the same look
my little nephew gets

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,160
when he can't figure out
how I got his nose.

166
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,770
You know, I have some remedial
magic tricks

167
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,540
that might be more your speed.

168
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,970
Like, ooh, look!

169
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,310
The pencil's rubber!

170
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,780
Hey, I think I know how you did
the card trick.

171
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,150
Oh, please, if I don't know,
you don't know.

172
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,800
That's axiomatic.

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,690
Come here.

174
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,520
You're right.

175
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,960
Not too bad for someone

176
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,500
who doesn't know
what "axiomatic" means.

177
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,370
Oh, hi.

178
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,710
Hey, you.

179
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,210
What happened with
the contacts?

180
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,480
One of them's upstairs.

181
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,050
The other one sort of slipped
back into my skull.

182
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,400
Hey, is that one of the new
shirts Priya got you?

183
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
Yeah.

184
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,320
You don't wanna
wash that.

185
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,190
No?
No, that's silk.

186
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,410
Seriously, what would you do
without me?

187
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,290
Yeah. (chuckles)

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,080
You know, I gotta
tell you, I think

189
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,660
you got a real winner
with Priya.
Yeah, me, too.

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,030
She seems really sweet.

191
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,200
Believe me, you do not want
to take that for granted.

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,970
There are a lot of bitches
out there.

193
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,370
Yeah, bitches are the worst.

194
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,240
All right, I'll
see you later.

195
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,950
Uh, Penny, there's something
I have to tell you.

196
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,080
What?

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,850
Okay, uh, how do I put this?

198
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,520
Um... are you familiar with
Darwin's observation

199
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,590
of the finches
in the Galapagos Islands?

200
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,890
Did they make a movie about it?

201
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,590
No.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,530
Then no.

203
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,330
All right, well, anyway, Darwin
observed that when two groups

204
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,740
of finches competed
over the same food source,

205
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,940
eventually one of them would
evolve a different beak shape

206
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,610
so they could feed on
something else.

207
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,210
Okay.

208
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,480
So what do you think we can
learn from that behavior

209
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,920
that we can apply
to our own lives?

210
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,960
Uh, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush?

211
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,590
Sure, that has birds in it.

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,270
It's fun talking to you,
Leonard; I always learn stuff.

213
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna count that.

214
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,610
PRIYA: Do you really have
to wear that in bed?

215
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,050
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me
to rub my eye during the night.

216
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,590
It was either this or one
of those giant neck cones.

217
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,990
So did you get
to talk to Penny?

218
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,700
Oh, yes.
Indeed, I did.

219
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
And?

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
She completely understood
everything I said. Case closed.

221
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,840
Was she upset?

222
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,140
Maybe, but that's
not my problem.

223
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,110
She's not my girlfriend,
you are.

224
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,110
I hope you weren't
cruel to her.

225
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,520
Is the autumn cruel
for letting the flowers die,

226
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,420
or is that just nature's way?

227
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,550
(knocking)

228
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,390
SHELDON: Leonard?
(knocking) Leonard?

229
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,520
Leonard?

230
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,030
What?!

231
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,760
I think I figured out
Wolowitz's magic trick,

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,930
and I need you
to pick a card.

233
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,470
I am not opening
that door, Sheldon!

234
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,800
As you wish.

235
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,450
Pick a card, put it back,
and prepare to be amazed.

236
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,450
Did you pick one?

237
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,890
Yep.

238
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,890
Is this your card?

239
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,160
Nope.

240
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Drat.

241
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,830
Is this your card?

242
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,000
No.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,070
I'll be right back.

244
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,430
Pick a card, Sheldon.

245
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,870
Now look at it,
and put it back in the deck.

246
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,440
Now do you remember your card?

247
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,540
Of course I do, I have
an eidetic memory.

248
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,310
My apologies.

249
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,780
Now shuffle the cards.

250
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,280
Shuffling.

251
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,020
Wait here.

252
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,490
Processing image,
cross-referencing...

253
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,260
Whatcha doin'?

254
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,290
I'm reverse engineering
Wolowitz's magic trick.

255
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,400
What's up
with the infrared cameras?

256
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,900
I'm measuring residual heat
levels on the playing cards

257
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,500
to determine
which one's been touched.

258
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,370
By the way,

259
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,770
if you hope to have children,

260
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,640
I suggest you switch
from briefs to boxers.

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,540
Your testicles look a tad warm.

262
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Holy crap,
are you connected

263
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,590
to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory?

264
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,160
Yes. I'm using their
Cray supercomputer

265
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,460
to analyze
shuffling patterns.

266
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,400
Sheldon, that computer
is used

267
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,660
for national defense.

268
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,330
Hacking into it is
a federal crime.

269
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,500
Relax, we're not under
attack right now.

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,140
Okay, I'm leaving before the
black helicopters get here.

271
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,880
And is this my card?

272
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,310
Rats!

273
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,620
I wonder if Howard used
a radioactive tracer.

274
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,520
Where am I going to find
uranium-235 this time of night?

275
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,730
Come on, CraigsList.

276
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,900
Is it racist that I took you
to an Indian restaurant?

277
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,370
It's okay, I like Indian food.

278
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,840
Or as you probably call it
back home, "food." (chuckles)

279
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,780
Why didn't you wear
your contacts?

280
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,080
Don't you like them?

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,350
No, no, I do.

282
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,420
It's just I knew I was having
curry tonight

283
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,950
and I only want one part
of my body to burn at a time.

284
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,930
You know... (clears throat)

285
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,830
...my company offered me a
position here in Los Angeles.

286
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,930
Does that mean you'd relocate
here permanently?

287
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,470
Maybe. What do you think?

288
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,800
I love it.

289
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,770
That's great!
(knocking)

290
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,910
Hi!

291
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,410
Hi! Just hang on.

292
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,550
(chuckles) Small world.

293
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,720
You did talk to her, didn't you?

294
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Of course, I did.
I talked and talked and talked.

295
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,420
Hey! Look at Leonard
in his fancy-ass
grownup clothes.

296
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,090
Way to go, Priya.
For once, he doesn't look

297
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,430
like a mannequin in
the boys' department.

298
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,200
(chuckles)
Hey, did he

299
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,970
tell you I saved
the silk shirt?

300
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,340
No, he did not.

301
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,440
He was gonna throw it
in the washing machine

302
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,140
with his
Spiderman underwear.

303
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,910
That's our Lenny, huh?
(laughs)

304
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,880
Yes, that's our Lenny.

305
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,130
So how's
the food here?

306
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, wow, that is
really, really good.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys are on a date.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
We can hang out
anytime. Have fun.

309
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,260
Bye.
Good night.

310
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,590
Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

311
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,680
Whoo! It really
sneaks up on ya, huh?

312
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,100
All right, I gotta go.

313
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,540
It is pretty spicy.

314
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,110
Oh, I've been meaning
to tell you,

315
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,380
I figured out
your magic trick.

316
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,180
Really?

317
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,380
Oh, yes.

318
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,850
In fact, I improved upon it.

319
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,820
I'd love to see that.

320
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,090
How about you, Raj?

321
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,920
Beefaroni <i>and</i> a show?

322
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,630
How do you turn that down?

323
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,500
All right. (clears throat)

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,170
Pick a card.

325
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,430
Okay.

326
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,000
Bippity-boppity-boo.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,310
(beeps)

328
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,720
What's with the wand
and the beep?

329
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,480
The wand is called showmanship,

330
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,850
and the beep is none
of your business.

331
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
(text alert tone sounds)

332
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,090
Oh! Excuse me.

333
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,630
I'm getting a text message

334
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,190
completely unrelated
to this magic trick.

335
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,800
Oh, look, my
dry cleaning's ready.

336
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,700
And your card was
the five of spades. Ta-da.

337
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,470
These cards have barcodes
on them.

338
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,540
The wand is a reader.

339
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,540
It's transmitting to your phone.

340
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,310
I said, "ta-da."

341
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,380
Show's over.

342
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,680
That's pathetic.

343
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,390
Let me show you how
a real magician does it.

344
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,720
Raj, take a card.

345
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,590
Don't let me see it.

346
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,930
Okay.

347
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,430
Three of clubs.

348
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,830
Son of a gun,

349
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,360
you're blowing my mind!

350
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,070
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

351
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,040
That does it.
I'm getting uranium.

352
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,250
You ever gonna tell him?

353
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,420
Maybe.
When it stops being fun.

354
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,900
So never.

355
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,560
Oh, hey, I was
just on my way to work.

356
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,030
Oh, okay,
its not important.

357
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,000
It can wait.

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,620
No, it's all right.
Walk me down.

359
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
So, what's up?

360
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,300
Uh, I kind of have
a problem

361
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,310
I was hoping
you could help me with.

362
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,370
Sure, anything.

363
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,880
Move out.

364
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,240
What?

365
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,580
Not far.

366
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,650
Hey, if you ever wanna
start a family,

367
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,500
La Cañada has
some great schools.

368
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay, I'm not
moving anywhere.

369
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,050
What the hell
is this all about?

370
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,620
Why does it have
to be about anything?

371
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,720
Can't a fella ask
his buddy to relocate,

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,830
no questions asked?

373
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,230
Oh, for God's sake,
Leonard,

374
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,730
this is about Priya,
isn't it?

375
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,460
She doesn't want me
hanging out with you.

376
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,630
Yes. There, I said it.

377
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
Okay, look.

378
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
I happen to like
your girlfriend.

379
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,520
And she likes you.

380
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,170
No, she doesn't.

381
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,910
Not really, no.

382
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,840
It doesn't matter.
Look, I promise from now on

383
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,310
I will keep
my distance from you.

384
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,710
Well, now, hold on.
What kind of distance

385
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,650
are we talking about?
Because we are neighbors.

386
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,950
I mean, I can hear the toilet
flush in your apartment.

387
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,590
You can hear my toilet flush?

388
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't listen for it,
but it's nice to know

389
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,730
everything's okay
with your plumbing.

390
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,600
The building's plumbing.

391
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,800
Leonard, I get it.

392
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,260
You're in
a new relationship now.

393
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,500
And I'm happy for you.

394
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,970
So why don't we
just shake hands
and part friends?

395
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,170
Well, now hold on.

396
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,400
How about this?

397
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,610
How about we still hang out,
but on the down-low?

398
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,140
Are you really that kind of guy?

399
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,810
No.

400
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,020
I actually felt kinda silly just
saying "on the down-low."

401
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,570
Good-bye, Leonard.

402
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,160
Penny, wait.

403
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,660
Ah!

404
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,430
Damn contacts.

405
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,320
Incoming.

406
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,910
- Hi!
- Hey!

407
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,160
Hello.

408
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,170
Why so glum, chum?

409
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,170
Apparently,
you can't hack into

410
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,140
a government
supercomputer

411
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,740
and then try
to buy uranium

412
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,870
without the Department of
Homeland Security tattling

413
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,040
to your mother.

414
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,920
Oh, that's too bad.

415
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,480
Figure out the magic trick yet?

416
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,790
(mocking):
Figure out the magic trick yet?

417
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,020
Want me to tell you
how to do it?

418
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,860
No.

419
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,590
Ill show you one more time.

420
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,190
Raj?

421
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,890
Hang on.

422
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,830
This time do it with me,

423
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,130
so I can make sure
there's no monkey business.

424
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,110
All right.

425
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,900
Two of hearts.
I hate you.

426
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,460
Yeah, he's gonna win
the Nobel Prize.

427
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,170
