1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,800
在2007的五月 Lily阿姨和Marshall叔叔结婚了
In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,200
就在纽约州北部具有历史意义的 Van Smoot House
at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,700
哇，好漂亮，Lily
Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,100
没错，就跟我一直想要的一样
Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,000
最好你本来就这么想
Well, that was a load of crap.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,900
孩子们，当你要结婚了 你会学到宝贵的一课
You see, kids, when you get married, you learn a hard lesson.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,200
你一开始打算办的婚礼 最终大都不会成真
The wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,500
[婚礼前8个月] 所以，我们决定办个小型的户外婚礼
So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
只请亲人和比较亲密的朋友
just family and close friends.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,700
不超过25人
No more than 25 people

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,100
在某个漂亮的花园
in a beautiful garden somewhere,

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
也许当我们走在红毯上时
maybe an acoustic guitar playing

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,100
可以用原音吉他伴奏
while we walk down the aisle.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,800
也许你们已知道有谁到了法院
And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,600
注册成为司仪
and registered as an officiant

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,600
他或者她，还是他--
so that he or she-- he--

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,200
可以主持仪式
could perform the ceremony.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,200
但你恨婚姻，你怎么会想主持婚礼？
But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
因为那会在无声无息下 灌输一个想法到每个在场的女性脑中
Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,000
那就是当我问什么问题时
that when I ask a question,

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,600
都要说 "我愿意"
you say, "I do."

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
没错
Yeah.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
[婚礼前6个月] 你越接近那个大日子
The closer you get to the big day,

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,500
就会做出越多的让步
the more concessions you make.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
太好了，我妈要我邀请Lessners一家
Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
那会让宾客数到达3位数
This puts our numbers in the triple digits.

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,000
哇，我想有时Lessner反而代表"比较多" (Less是较少之意)
Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,600
你知道有时候"较少反而是较多" 是怎么样的情况
You know how like sometimes less is more.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,800
没错，现在就是了，是吧，宝贝？
Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,300
你知道吗？没关系 这只代表这会是个有点大的户外婚礼
You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,500
[婚礼前5个月] 所以不办户外婚礼了
So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,500
Marshall的老爸听信人家说 在纽约办户外婚礼
Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York,

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,100
他会被抢劫，所以要改在室内
he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,800
会很棒的，我们还是可以用原音吉他伴奏
It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
[婚礼前3个月] 所以不用原音吉他
So now, instead of an acoustic guitar,

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,400
要改用竖琴
we're having a harp player.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,500
我爸欠一个家伙人情... 那家伙的女儿会弹竖琴
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,300
她正点吗？我很乐意从我的清单中 除去"竖琴手"这一项
Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross "harp player" off my list.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,400
那清单有多长？
How long is this list?

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,600
老兄，我可不打算去数那清单有几张
Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,100
我不是笨蛋
I'm not crass.

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,900
无论如何，那无所谓，因为她怀孕了
Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,100
太好了！我可以划掉两个项目
Sweet! I can cross off two things.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,300
Lily和Marshall的超大室内婚礼那天来到...
And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding...

47
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,700
[婚礼前1小时又42分] 伴随着竖琴
with a harp.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,900
嗨，Lily
Hi, Lily.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
哇，Andrea
Wow. Andrea.

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,300
你真的是怀孕了
You really are pregnant.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,100
没错
Yeah.

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,600
你的腹部这么...你怎么弹？
How do you play the harp with your belly so...?

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,500
我没有真的要-- 我只能弹到大概一半的琴弦
Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,700
你要只用半个竖琴来弹
You only play half the harp?

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,900
没错
Yeah.

56
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
哦，不，没关系，Lily，我会处理的
Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this.

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,800
我来弹另一半，这很难学吗？
Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,900
我已经学了12年了
I've been studying the harp for 12 years.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
不过我学东西很快
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,400
你有没有听过"吉他英雄"这游戏 我一天内就会玩了
You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"? Learned that in a day.

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,700
那有"竖琴英雄"吗？
Is there a "Harp Hero"?

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Robin，没关系
Robin, it's fine.

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,400
那，你预产期是何时？
So, so, when are you due?

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,300
周二
Tuesday.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
哇，那快到了
Wow, that's soon.

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,000
是上周二
Last Tuesday.

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,300
[婚礼前1小时又38分] 见鬼，我们得辞退她
Holy crap, we have to fire her.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
她会在你的典礼到一半时 就生出一个小伙子来
She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,200
Robin，我不会让自己太不安
Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out.

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,700
我讨厌那些说
I hate those women who say,

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,200
"哦，我的婚礼一定要十全十美"的女人
"Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."

72
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,000
总是会出状况的 有时候是DJ放错歌了
Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist.

73
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,800
有时候你会在新人退场时 踩到胎盘滑倒
Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
能不能马上给我些威士忌苏打？
Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,900
不，在招待会前，我不能提供食物给人
No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.

76
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,500
哇，你刚刚少掉了一大笔的小费，兄弟
Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,000
我也不被允许接受小费，兄弟
I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,500
那你有没有被允许接受批评？
You allowed to accept criticism?

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,700
你，先生，是只笨驴... 兄弟
You, sir, are an ass... buddy.

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,200
嘿，你们想知道什么搭讪词 对竖琴手没有作用吗？
Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player?

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
"嘿，宝贝，要弹(吹)吗？" (pluck有弹乐器之意，但也有口交之意)
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"

82
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,200
真的？那没有用？
Really? That didn't work.

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
连一点用都没有
Not even a little.

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
嘿！Bill是谁啊？
Hey! Who's Bill?

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Bill？
Bill?

86
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,600
对啊，这家伙在酒吧跟我讲话
Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,300
我能请问你些事吗？
Can I ask you something?

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,700
典礼中是什么时候他们会问有没有人反对？
Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
呃... 我想他们好像不再这么做了
Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,700
那你认为什么时候比较好？
Oh, so when do you think someone should do it?

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,700
是等休息时间的时候还是？
Just wait for a lull or what?

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,800
哦，不
Oh, no.

93
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,100
你看到的是不是一个想要成为裁判 但是没有成功的人？
Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?

94
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,400
的确有点像
He kind of did.

95
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,800
那就是Scooter
That's Scooter.

96
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,300
你的高中男友，Scooter？
Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,900
他的真名叫Bill
His real name is Bill.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
我妈一定邀请他了
My mom must have invited him.

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
为什么？她为什么要这么做？
Why? Why would she do that?

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
我们两家关系很亲密
Our families are really close.

101
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
但是邀我的前男友？
But my ex-boyfriend?

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
拜托，老妈
Come on, Mom.

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,600
我可没有邀请老爸抓到 跟你在一起的那个职业壁球选手
I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with.

104
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,800
哦，我需要杯酒
Oh, I need a glass of wine.

105
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,700
我去拿
I'll get it.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
哦，谢了，嘿，Marshall还好吧？
Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?

107
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,500
他很好
He's great.

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,800
他就要去剪头发了
He's about to get his hair cut.

109
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,700
哦，我很担心我的侄子会剪得太短
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,500
我也是，我整晚睡不着
Me, too. I was up all night.

111
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,500
嗨，Lily
Hello, Lily.

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,300
嘿，Bill
Hey, Bill.

113
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
嘿，Barney
Hey, Barney.

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,800
Scooter，你来这里干什么？
Scooter, what are you doing here?

115
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
我不再叫"Scooter"了
It's not "Scooter" anymore.

116
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,100
叫我Bill
It's Bill.

117
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,700
我变了很多，Lily
A lot of things have changed about me, Lily,

118
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
但有一点没变
but one hasn't.

119
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,800
我还是爱着你
I still love you.

120
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,100
我来这里就是要赢回你的心
And I came here to win you back.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
你真是可爱，哦，不，是真的吗？
You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?

122
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
Lily，我知道这样很疯狂
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,

123
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,900
但我爱你
but I love you,

124
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,300
如果你能看着我的眼睛
and if you can look me in the eye

125
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,100
告诉我你想嫁给Marshall
and tell me that you want to marry Marshall,

126
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,200
我马上离开，永远离开你的生命
I will leave right now and be out of your life forever.

127
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,500
我想...
I want...

128
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,900
我想...
I want...

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Scooter！
Scooter!

130
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,400
我需要杯酒
I need a glass of wine.

131
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
而我需要你立刻从我眼前消失
And I need you to get out of my face.

132
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,100
是给新娘的，所以...
It's for the bride, so...

133
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
白酒还是红酒？
White or red?

134
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,700
白酒
White.

135
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
还有，她也想要点威士忌苏打
And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,200
马上来
You got it.

137
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,800
她还想要盘烟熏杏仁
She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,000
我这里没有
I don't have any,

139
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,300
但我想我可以跑到外面转角去买一些
but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.

140
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,200
只不过这是她人生中最重大的日子，所以...
Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,700
游戏开始了
Let the games begin.

142
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
[婚礼前47分] 给，不能久留，有些事想试试
Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.

143
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
也许我的话没法改变你的心意
Maybe my words won't change your mind,

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,100
但也许一首诗可以
but maybe the words of a poet will.

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,300
我在"November Rain"读到的 ("枪与玫块"乐团的歌曲)
I read from "November Rain."

146
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,500

Barney说你需要我赶走 一个叫Scooter的家伙？

那就是Scooter
That's Scooter.

151
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,200
交给我了
I'm on it.

152

- 嘿 - 嘿

153
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,600
我能要你的电话号码吗？
Can I have your phone number?

154
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
不行
No.

155
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,000
给新娘的
It's for the bride.

156
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,800
哦，等等，我拿支笔
Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
新娘要你走路走慢点
The bride wants you to walk slower.

158
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,600
[婚礼前40分]

哦，哇
Oh, wow.

160
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
哦，Robin...
Oh. Robin...

161
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
我的妆看来很完美
My makeup looks perfect right now,

162
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
但我要哭了，想想办法吧
and I'm about to cry. Do something.

163
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,700
我的乳头很多毛
I have hairy nipples.

164
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,500
真的？
Really?

165
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,300
假的，但真的有用，不是吗？
No, but it worked, didn't it?

166
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,500
嘿，有件事很好笑
Hey. Funny story.

167
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,200
我扭倒一个我以为是Scooter的人
I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter.

168
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,900
结果那是你的摄影师
Turns out it was your photographer.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
别担心，我有这支很棒的照相手机 所以不会有问题的
Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.

170
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
有摄影师？
There's a photographer?

171
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

172
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
- 没关系，我只要打电话给... - Robin，停，停
- Okay, I just have to call... - Robin, stop. Stop.

173
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,900
没关系的
It's okay.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,300
今天我不会让任何事情影响到我
I am not gonna let anything get to me today.

175
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,100
[婚礼前33分] 我刚接到花店的电话
I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here

176
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
花要到典礼中才会到
till halfway through the ceremony.

177
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
我没事
I'm okay.

178
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,500
[婚礼前28分] 不是故意要打扰你，但是... 我想我在停车场捡到你的面纱
I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.

179
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,600
我没事
I'm fine.

180
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,036
[婚礼前24分]

181
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
只是让你知道一下，我的羊水破了
Just FYI: my water broke.

182
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,700
但我也许可以...
But I can probably...

183
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,600
...撑过去
...make it through.

184
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,100
完全没关系
Totally cool.

185
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:43,562
[婚礼前21分]

186
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,600
哦，不
Oh, no.

187
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Lily，我想我忘了带你的婚礼内裤
Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties.

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,100
我以为我带了，实在很抱歉
I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.

189
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
没关系，我穿现在穿的这件就好
Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.

190
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

191
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,500
今天我要嫁给Marshall了
I'm marrying Marshall today.

192
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,500
所以就算我要没戴头纱走过红毯
So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle

193
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,900
在一个没有花的房间里
without a veil in a room that has no flowers

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,600
音乐是一个正在分娩的女人 弹着半支竖琴
to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning,

195
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,000
同时我的高中男友念着"枪与玫瑰"的歌词
as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics.

196
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,200
那都没关系
But that's okay,

197
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,800
因为根本也没摄影师在场 能照下任何照片
because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
Lily，你还好吗？
Lily, are you okay?

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100
你觉得呢？！我当然不好！
What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay!

200
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,500
所有我的婚礼上可能发生的状况都发生了
Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has!

201
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
一切都被破坏了！
It's ruined!

202
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,700
你不是说"我不会想要一个完美婚礼"？
What happened to "I don't want a perfect wedding"?

203
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,400
成熟点吧，Robin 我当然想要完美的婚礼！
Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding!

204
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,500
哦，天啊，我本想... 我本想不要太在意婚礼的，但是...
Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but...

205
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,800
我很在意，我今天应该要感觉像公主一样
I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.

206
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,000
你会的
And you will.

207
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,300
不会有事的，宝贝
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

208
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,300
我为何不到外面去？ 我有样东西可以让你好过点
Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.

209
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,700
你有什么东西可能让我好过点？
What could you have that could possibly make me feel better?

210
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,400
天啊，希望Marshall今天过得比我好
God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.

211
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,800
哦，我的天啊，我的天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

212
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,200
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

213
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

214
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,600
- 我的天啊！ - 怎么了？
- Oh, my God! - What?

215
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,200
不是太短
Well, it's not too short.

216
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,517
[婚礼前17分]

217
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,000
我的头发，瞧我的头发！ 她把我的头发毁了
My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair!

218
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,200
我看起来好像是"新好男孩"的成员 (90年代很红的男孩团体)
I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!

219
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,200
的确很像
You totally do.

220
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
而且甚至不是好的新好男孩
And not even the good Backstreet Boys,

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,200
是比较老，跳着差劲舞步 复出巡回演唱的新好男孩
the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.

222
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
好的"新好男孩"？
The good Backstreet Boys?

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
我该怎么办？！
Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!

224
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000
你到底发生什么事？
What-what the hell happened to you?

225
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,800
Lily的侄子上美容学院
Lily's cousin is in beauty school,

226
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,700
Lily不想要她弄她的头发
and Lily didn't want her to do her hair,

227
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
所以跟她说她可以弄我的
so she said she could do mine.

228
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,200
不要太短就好，可以吧？
So, um, just not-not too short, okay?

229
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
我们甚至一点都不用剪
Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all.

230
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,100
可以造型一下就好
Could just give it some style.

231
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,300
那就太好了
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.

232
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
因为要是太短，就会看来很怪
'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird.

233
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,200
我可不想在那个时候看起来很怪
And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.

234
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
我可以给你弄很酷的挑染 (tips挑染，也有提示建议之意)
Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,700
我不认为我要当一个酷哥 会需要人家的建议
I don't think I need advice on how to be cool,

236
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,200
但也好，就弄吧
but yeah, great, lay that on me.

237
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,100
我不能像这样结婚，不行！
I can't get married like this! There's no way!

238
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
让我看看我能怎么办
Ah, let me see what I can do.

239
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
什么？你能怎么办？
What? What can you do?

240
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
我有超能力的
I have a superpower.

241
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
Lily会杀了我的！
Lily is gonna kill me!

242
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,600
瞧我！
Look at me!

243
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,300
她不会想嫁给像这样的我
She's not gonna want to marry me like this.

244
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
别傻了，她当然愿意
That's crazy. Of course she will.

245
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
那你愿意跟我结婚吗？
Would you marry me?

246
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,800
不，不过不是因为头发 是因为我有个原则：
No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule:

247
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,700
绝不跟曾一起比赛过放屁的人结婚
never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.

248
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,700
太好了，所以你现在是说Lily和我 根本不应该结婚？
Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?

249
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
大家注意我这边好吗？
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

250
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,900
是跟新娘有关的
It's for the bride.

251
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,800
首先，新娘希望...
One, the bride would...

252
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,600
我肩上所有压力能释放一下
like all of this tension out of my shoulders.

253
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,400
而她想要
And she would like, let's say,

254
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,200
穿着不合宜的短裙的你帮忙消除一下
you in the inappropriately short dress to rub them.

255
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,600
第二...
Two...

256
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,900
第二点是什么？
What was two?

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,400
好的，我们是出了点小状况
Okay, we have a bit of a situation.

258
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
不要太惊慌
Let's not panic.

259
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
试着找解决办法
Let's just find a solution.

260
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,000
老兄，你剃了你的头发
Dude, you shaved your freakin' head.

261
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,000
没错，但那很好
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,900
我应该把它剃光光 真是个很好的解决方法
I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution.

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,400
光头很酷，对吧？
Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right?

264
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
布鲁斯威利，乔丹，还有小甜甜布兰妮... (布兰妮前阵子被看到剃了个大光头)
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears...

265
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
天啊，我做了什么？
Oh, God, what did I do?!

266
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,000
你怎么能让我剃我自己的头发？
How could you let me shave my head?!

267
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,700
- 什么？！ - 你真是史上最差劲的伴郎！
- What?! - You're the worst best man ever!

268
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
我恨你！
I hate you!

269
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,600
我不出去见人了！ 我要离开，永远不再回来
I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.

270
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
我要去找出放在那棵树旁岩石下的钱
I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree

271
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,900
去跟Zihautanejo海滩的那家伙一起住 (这两句其实是"申肖克的救赎"的结局 台译片名是"刺激1995")
and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
老兄，他们是罪犯
Dude, those guys are criminals.

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,500
只有Red是，Andy是被冤枉的 (前述电影的主角)
Only Red Andy was falsely accused.

274
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Ted，你是我的伴郎！ 你得想想办法
Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!

275
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,900
没事的，过来，深呼吸一下，好吗？
Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right?

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,100
别担心，别担心
Don't worry. Don't worry.

277
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,100
- 这个我拿着 - 不要！
- I'll just... I'll take these. - No!

278
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,900
- 嗨，Ben叔叔是吧？ - 是的
- Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right? - Yes.

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
我们在后面有一点点小麻烦
Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there.

280
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
你在想你能不能帮个忙
Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.

281
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
可以啊
Yeah.

282
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Marshall不小心剃掉了他部份的头发
Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
- 哦，不！ - 没错
- Oh, no! - Yeah.

284
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
所以我是这么想的
Yeah, so here's what I was thinking.

285
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,600
要是我能找到什么来遮着剃光的地方？
What if I found something to cover up the bald area?

286
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,200
没错，那就太好了
Yeah, that would probably work,

287
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,600
但是用什么呢？
but with what?

288
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
这是个难题
That's a tough one.

289
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,300
也许是顶假发
Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um...

290
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,500
像是男性假发
toupee.

291
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,500
某个符合他头发颜色的东西
Something that matches his hair color,

292
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,300
那也刚好有点像你头上头发的颜色
which is, which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair.

293
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
是喔
Mm, yeah.

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,100
但这里有谁戴假发？
Does anyone here wear a toupee?

295
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,900
应该不难找到
Shouldn't be hard to find out.

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
大部份都是很差的
Most of them are pretty bad.

297
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,000
没有错，没有错
That is true. That is true.

298
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,600
我们只要找到某个戴着
We just need to find someone who wears a toupee

299
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,500
和Marshall的及你的头发
that is the same color

300
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,700
一样颜色的假发的人
as Marshall's and your hair.

301
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,100
孩子，那真是很困难的事
Boy, that's a pretty tall order.

302
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,500
真的？
Really?

303
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
你难道想不到任何地方
You can't think of any place in the general area

304
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,900
可能会有我跟你描述的那样的假发？
where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,200
不，除非是我头上...
No, not off the top of my...

306
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,600
不，不行
No. Can't.

307
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,300
让我们从另一个角度来谈这件事 我的口袋里有50块钱
Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket

308
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,600
- 那可能比... - 新娘需要这个
- which is probably a lot more... - The bride needs this.

309
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,565
[婚礼前13分]

310
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,100
我想真的有点用
Actually, I think it kinda works.

311
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,300
的确
It totally does.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
Barney？
Barney?

313
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
老实说，我
To be honest, I'm, uh,

314
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,100
我没有机会戴，感到很羡慕
I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,900
好了，问题解决了
Okay, problem solved.

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,900
危机解除了
Crisis averted.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
可以结婚了
Let's get me married.

318
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,400
看起来糟透了，是不是？
It looks terrible, doesn't it?

319
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,700
那有点
It kinda looks like fur,

320
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,500
让你看起来像是梳洗整洁的"大脚" (外型类似雪怪的传说生物)
which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.

321
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
- 哦，你知道... - 是不好的那一种像
- Oh, you know... - In a bad way.

322
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,900
嘿，很酷的头发，兄弟
Hey. Cool hair, bro.

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,300
你的衬衫怎么了
What happened to your shirt?

324
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,700
我扭倒那个办外烩的时候 沾上了酱汁
I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.

325
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,500
要不要再找件穿上？
You gonna put another shirt on?

326
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,500
不，我没关系
No, I'm good.

327
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,300
嘿，你们有看到Scooter吗？
Hey, you guys seen Scooter?

328
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,900
什么？什么？Scooter在这里？ 那家伙在我的婚礼中？
What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,700
不会太久的，兄弟
Not for long, bro.

330
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,400
不会太久的
Not for long.

331
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
你知道吗？我需要点空气
Okay, you know what? I need some air.

332
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,000
我想我们应该出去走走
I think we should go for a walk, okay?

333
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,700
那可以掩盖掉问题
It would cover up the problem.

334
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
那是个节庆
It's festive

335
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
庆祝这个伟大的国家祖先留下的遗产
and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.

336
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,500
好了，除非你真的有一顶在你的车上
Okay, unless you actually have one in your car,

337
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,500
不然就别再提议什么 "有认证的美洲原住民头饰"
stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.

338
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,900
哦，不
Oh, no.

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
哦，我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

340
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,200
Marshall...
Marshall...

341
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,000
Lily，你不应该看见我的
Lily, you're not supposed to see me.

342
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,000
真见鬼了，我想任何人都不应该看到你
Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.

343
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,500
怎么了？Amy把你弄成这样的？
What happened? Did Amy do this to you?

344
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,300
只有挑染是，其余是我搞的 很抱歉，宝贝
Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby.

345
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,300
我把个整个婚礼都毁了，是吧？
I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?

346
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
哦，不，你没有毁了婚礼，宝贝
Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie.

347
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,100
它早就毁了
It was already ruined.

348
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,900
没有花，没有摄影师
There's no flowers, no photographer.

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
还有，Scooter也在这
Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.

350
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,700
我知道，我听说了
Yeah, I know. I heard.

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
我的面纱被弄得乱七八糟 那个竖琴手在生孩子
My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor,

352
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
而我没有穿着我的婚礼内衣
and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.

353
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,600
什么？ 没有后面写着"Marshall的财产"那件？
What? No "Property of Marshall" across the back?

354
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
那人家怎么知道那是谁的屁股？
How are people going to know whose butt that is?

355
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
怎么了？
What happened?

356
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,500
记得我们本来想要的婚礼 是秘密的户外婚礼吗？
Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?

357
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
真希望我们能办那样的婚礼
I wish we could have that wedding.

358
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
那就办啊
So do it.

359
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,300
什么？
What?

360
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
现在就结婚
Get married now.

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
就在这
Right here.

362
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,700
听我说，这里不就是你们想要的户外
Look, it's outside like you always wanted.

363
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
只有亲密的朋友
Intimate, close friends.

364
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,400
没有吉它，但很接近了
There's no guitar, but it's pretty close.

365
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Barney可以主持仪式
Barney can officiate.

366
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
对，我可以
Yes. Yes, I can.

367
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,600
抱歉了各位，你们全都掉了样东西：
Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something:

368
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
你们的下巴--
your jaws--

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,500
因为Barney Stinson就要做 一场婚礼的共犯
because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.

370
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,000
我们可以这么做吗？ 那在那里的那些人怎么办？
Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?

371
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,200
那边也办，然后要是出了什么状况
Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong,

372
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
你们就不会在意 因为真正的婚礼在这里办过了
you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.

373
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,700
你怎么想，宝贝？
What do you think, baby?

374
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,700
我喜欢这个主意
I love it.

375
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,000
我也是
Me, too.

376
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
就这么做吧，让我们在结婚前结婚
Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.

377
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
太好了
Great.

378
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,500
等等
Wait, hold on.

379
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,600
抱歉打扰一下，先生
Excuse me, sir.

380
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,800
我们可以借一下你的帽子吗？
Could we borrow your hat?

381
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,000
好的
Okay.

382
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

383
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,800
帽子
Hat.

384
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
我们在想到帽子之前
We thought of authentic Native American headdress

385
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,600
竟会先想到了"有认证的美洲原住民头饰"
before we thought of hat.

386
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,100
谢谢各位光临
Thank you all for coming.

387
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
怕在座有人不认识我...
For those of you who don't know me...

388
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
我并不是那种很相信婚姻的人
I'm not the biggest believer in marriage.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,900
但是... 你们在一起真的很棒
But... you two are so great together, you know?

390
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,900
就好像，你们是为彼此而存在
It's like you were, uh, made for each other.

391
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,200
- 他要哭了 - 不，才没有
- He's gonna cry. - No, I'm not.

392
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
我没有，我没有，我没有...
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

393
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Lily和Marshall...
Lily and Marshall...

394
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,800
当大家看到你们，他们...
when everyone sees you, they...

395
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
看见的是真爱
see true love.

396
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,400
最美的爱...
It's the best love...

397
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,800
我们可以... 直接跳到交换戒指之类的吗？
Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?

398
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,400
不好了
Oh, no.

399
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,900
我没有带我的誓辞
I don't have my vows.

400
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
我也没有带我的
I don't have mine either.

401
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,900
你们不需要誓辞 只要说说为什么爱他/她
You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.

402
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
好，我先
Okay, I'll go first.

403
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,700
Lily
Lily,

404
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,200
我爱你有一百万种理由
there are a million reasons why I love you.

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,500
你让我笑
You make me laugh

406
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,300
当我生病时照顾我
and you take care of me when I'm sick.

407
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,400
你贴心，关心 甚至做了一道鸡蛋菜肴以我命名
You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me.

408
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,200
她在炒松蛋之前，放了些意式沙拉酱在里面
She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them.

409
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,900
叫作"Marshall蛋"，而且那棒极了
It's called "Eggs Marshall," and it's awesome.

410
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,400
但我爱你最主要的理由是
But the main reason that I love you is

411
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,400
你是我最好的朋友，Lily
that you're my best friend, Lily.

412
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
你是... 我有过最好的朋友
You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had.

413
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
- 抱歉了，兄弟 - 没问题
- I'm sorry, buddy. - No problem.

414
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,900
完全没关系
It's totally okay.

415
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
轮到我了
My turn.

416
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,400
哦，谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

417
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Marshall，我爱你，因为你很有趣
Marshall, I love you because you're funny

418
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,900
你让我感到被爱
and you make me feel loved

419
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
让我感到安全
and you make me feel safe

420
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,400
而为了我们的周年纪念 你送了我一件汗衫，上面写点
and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says,

421
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,800
"Lily和Marshall天下无双，自'96年开始"
"Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."

422
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,900
我有点希望现在我是穿着它的
I kinda wish I was wearing it right now

423
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
因为那有你的味道
'cause it smells like you.

424
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,000
但我爱你最主要的理由 Marshall Ericksen
But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen,

425
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
是你让我快乐
is you make me happy.

426
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,800
你总是让我快乐
You make me happy all the time.

427
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,600
嘿，我找到你的内裤了
Hey, I found your panties!

428
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
我没关系
I'm good.

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,500
Marshall，你愿意接受Lily成为你的妻子
Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?

430
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,400
- 慢一点 - 我没办法
- Slow down. - I can't.

431
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
由今日起互相扶持，直到人生最后一天？
From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?

432
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,400
我愿意
I do.

433
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Lily，你答应Marshall成为你的丈夫 并互相扶持... 一天？
Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?

434
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,800
我愿意
I do.

435
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
好，那么
Okay, then,

436
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,200
以在Lafayette街的法院工作的 那个超刻薄的老巴基斯坦人
by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man

437
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,800
所授予我的权力
who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street,

438
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,200
我现在宣布你们成为夫妻
I now pronounce you man and wife.

439
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,100
