Jimmy, how's that sweepin' going?

34
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
掃著呢  老爸
Goin' good, pop.

35
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,120
你好嗎
Hi. How are ya?

36
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,280
你好  先生
Hello, sir.

37
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,650
不知道你能不能幫我個忙
Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could help me.

38
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,520
什么事
Yeah?

39
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,840
我今早開車進城
Well, I drove into the city this morning.

40
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,940
通常我都搭火車  但今天特別趕時間
U-usually, I take the train, but I was in just such a rush

41
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,300
趕著給我兒子弗萊迪買藥
to get some medicine for my son, Freddie.

42
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,310
他有癲癇
He has epilepsy.

43
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,310
今天早上發作的時候
He had an attack this morning, but during his fit,

44
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,670
打翻了我妻子手中的藥
he knocked the bottle of medicine out of my wife's hand

45
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,190
砰一聲  撒了一地
and just -- bam, one huge puddle.

46
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,370
真糟糕
That's terrible.

47
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,290
長話短說吧  我開車進城
Well, long story short -- drove into town,

48
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,680
身上所有錢都拿去買了藥
bought the new medicine with every last nickel in my pocket,

49
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,610
接著我的車就拋錨了
and then my car died.

50
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,810
我的天  這實在...
Oh, god, that's -- that's just, uh...

51
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,760
我知道
I know.

52
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,740
屋漏偏逢連夜雨  對吧
When it rains, it pours, right?

53
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,160
我試著發動  怎么也點不著
I-I tried the ignition, just nothin' -- not firing.

54
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,110
總之  我只知道
And, anyway, now I've convinced myself

55
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,820
在我帶藥回家之前
that Freddie's ‭gonna have another seizure

56
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,710
弗萊迪的癲癇隨時會再次發作
before I get back with the medicine.

57
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,550
要是你能幫我  我會感激不盡
So, i-if you can help me, I would be so grateful.

58
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,920
我可以幫你檢查一下車子
Well, I could come out and check your car for ya.

59
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,320
可能只是火花塞的問題
You know, ‭maybe it's just a spark plug.

60
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,990
我儲藏室里有一盒火花塞
I-I-I got a box of plugs back in the stockroom.

61
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,410
謝謝  我很感激
Thanks, ‭and I-I appreciate that,

62
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,930
但如果你能給我五塊就好了...
but if you could possibly just spare $5 instead...

63
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,140
我寧可打車也不愿再折騰我那破車
I'd rather grab a cab than take a chance with my old clunker.

64
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,970
好啊  五元
Yeah, $5.

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,710
如果能給的話
I-if you can spare it.

66
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,230
行  當然
Yeah, okay, sure.

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,510
爸  過來一下
Dad, c'mere!

68
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,720
過來一下
C'mere!

69
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,280
爸  這是詐騙  跟上周那個乞丐一樣
Dad, it's a rip-off, just like that bum from last week.

70
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,880
吉米
Jimmy.

71
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,640
鎮上的騙棍都知道
Every grifter in town knows that

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,060
這里是騙取施舍的好地點
this is the spot to come for an easy handout.

73
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,060
"騙棍"  你哪里學來的詞
Grifter? Where in the world did you learn that word?

74
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,130
爸  他鬼話連篇
Dad, his story's baloney.

75
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,100
他多半根本沒有兒子
He probably doesn't even have a son.

76
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,940
他在敲詐你
He's conning you.

77
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,230
吉米  萬一你錯了呢
Jimmy... What if you're wrong?

78
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,960
這樣吧
Y-you know what?

79
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,010
很抱歉麻煩你們  我這就走
Sorry to bother you folks. I-I'm gonna get outta here.

80
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,100
-我這就...  -不不不
- I-I'm gonna... - No, no, no, no, no.

81

- Dad. - ‭No, no bother.

There's $10 for you.

真的很慷慨
That's -- that is so generous.

86
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,450
沒事  這樣吧
Of course, and -- and you know what?

87
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,820
我去后面儲藏室
I'm gonna go back in the stockroom.

88
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,980
找點火花塞
I'm gonna find those spark plugs.

89
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,720
或許能幫你把車發動  如何
Maybe we'll get your car started for you, okay?

90
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,170
來吧  吉米  幫我看一會兒行嗎
Come on, Jimmy. Just man the till, okay?

91
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,650
我馬上回來
And I'll just be back in a jiff, okay?

92
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,490
一條酷爾煙多少錢
How much for a carton of Kools?

93
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,330
四塊錢
4 bucks.

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,630
好  來一條
Yeah, gimme a carton.

95

Gimme two cartons.

Oh, gosh.

火花塞分明就在這里
These spark plugs are back here somewhere.

再給我一分鐘好嗎
Just give me one more minute, okay?

-小小地  -一點點
- A tad? ‭- A wee bit.

他決定不能再昧著良心
He's decided that he can no longer in good conscience claim

128
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,729
說現場發現的槍是屠庫·塞拉曼加的
claim that the gun found at the scene belonged to Tuco Salamanca.

-那是誰的槍呢  -誰知道呢
- So, whose gun was it? ‭- Who's to say?

少如響尾蛇  多則如沙粒
Somewhere between the number of rattlesnakes and grains of sand.

所以很多
So...a lot.

133
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,049
是你的槍嗎  厄門紹特先生
Was it your gun, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

134
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,359
他沒這么說
No, he's not saying that.

135
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,029
能讓厄門紹特先生自己說嗎
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?

136
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,719
槍不是塞拉曼加的
The gun wasn't Salamanca's.

137
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,119
我只知道這么多
That's all I can tell you.

138
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,599
你原來說是他的
You told us it was.

139
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,359
你說塞拉曼加掏出槍對著你
You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.

140
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,849
他沒有
Well, he didn't.

141
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,639
-你為什么要改陳述  -好公民嘛
- Why are you changing your story? ‭- Good citizenship.

142
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,119
槍上只有一個人的指紋
Look, there was only one set of prints on the gun --

143
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,419
塞拉曼加的
Salamanca's.

144
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,439
槍怎么可能不是他的呢
How's that gonna happen if it wasn't his?

145
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,379
這個就不能問我的委托人了  對吧
That's not really for my client to say, now, is it?

146
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,349
他又不是鑒定專家
He's not a forensics expert.

147
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,599
誰知道呢  說不定
Who knows? Maybe it, uh,

148
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,159
是從飛過的鳥兒嘴里掉下來的
fell ‭from a passing bird's beak,

149

塞拉曼加先生接住了槍想扔掉
and Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away.

00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,589
我是說有好多可能性
I mean, ‭the possibilities are endless.

151
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,579
塞拉曼加威脅你了嗎  厄門紹特先生
Did Salamanca threaten you, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

152
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,389
我們想讓他多關幾年
We wanna put this guy away for years.

153
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,789
槍是最關鍵的  你們知道
The gun makes all the difference. You know that.

154
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,899
你想讓他早點出來再次傷害你嗎
You gonna let this person victimize you twice?

155
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,869
別說槍的事了  行嗎
Forget about the gun, all right?

156
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,519
槍不是塞拉曼加的
The gun was not Salamanca's.

如果你們要把槍納為證據
If you try to introduce it into evidence,

158
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,489
厄門紹特先生會幫被告人辯護
Mr. Ehrmantraut ‭will make himself available to the defense,

他會澄清是非
and he will set the record straight,

直截了當  毫不含糊
categorically and unequivocally.

161
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,019
他威脅你了  還是賄賂你了
Did he threaten you or pay you off?

162
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,199
夠了  到此為止  走吧
Okay, that's it. We're done. Okay. Let's go.

163
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,699
你沒做錯
You're doing the right the thing.

164
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,779
這個叫塞拉曼加的
This Salamanca character?

165
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,139
簡直是瘋子
Maniac.

00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,009
我自己也
I had my own...

168
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:08,829
跟他打過交道
...thing with him.

169
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,409
之前因為利益沖突啊啥的  就沒有說
I didn't wanna say it before because of conflict of interest,

170
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,849
但是他確實是個神經病
yadda yadda, but, yeah, he's nuts.

171
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,489
他把我五花大綁帶到沙漠里
I'm talking he had me hog-tied in the desert

172
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,379
拿槍頂著我腦袋
with a gun to my head.

173
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,339
當著我的面折了兩個家伙的腿
Broke two guys' legs right in front of me.

174
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,609
要是我沒說服他  他可能就把他們...
If I hadn't talked him down, he probably would've...

175
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,669
血淋淋的細節就不談了  總之很慘
I'll spare you the gory details, but it was a deal and a half --

176
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,449
讓人永生難忘啊
not something you forget.

177
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,159
你跟我說這些干嘛
And you're telling me this why?

178
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,109
別太苛責自己
Don't be too tough on yourself.

179
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,559
人們說  謹慎即大勇
Like they say, discretion is the better part of valor.

180
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,209
換我也會這樣做
I would've done the same thing.

181
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,819
今天算我幫你  不收費
Hey, today, ‭it's on me -- no charge.

182
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,269
你搭下趟電梯
You take the next one.

183
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:56,839
照常收費
And bill me.

184
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,319
忘恩負義
Ingrate.

185
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:06,919
喂  吉米
Hey, Jimmy.

186
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,349
你跟霍華德說了嗎
Did you tell Howard yet?

187
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,329
我現在還不能說
I can't really talk right now.

188
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,529
你沒跟他說啊
You didn't tell him.

189
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,259
還沒  等確定了我才能說
No, and I won't until it's rock-solid,

190
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,119
要等到錄用通知書到手
like offer-letter-in-hand solid.

191
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,239
你什么時候能拿到錄用通知書
When are you gonna get that offer letter?

192
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,069
下禮拜四吧
‭I'm guessing next Thursday,

193
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,699
跟合伙人面試過以后
After my interview with the partners.

194
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,539
-那只是走個流程吧  -差不多
- Yeah, but that's just a formality, right? ‭- Basically.

195
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,619
希望是
I hope.

196
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:26,909
到底給你開的什么條件
What's the offer you think?

197
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,719
我是說實質的
I mean, brass tacks.

198
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,779
比不上你在戴維斯梅因律所的
Well, it's not gonna be as much as your deal at Davis & Main,

199
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,819
但是兩年后可以成為合伙人
but they'll make me partner in two years,

200
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,769
而在HHM需要五年或者永遠不能
as opposed to somewhere between five years and never at HHM.

201
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,139
不錯嘛
Not too shabby.

202
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,159
還幫我還法學院貸款
Yeah, and then there's my law-school loans.

203
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,729
還要還多少  幾千塊嗎
What is that -- a couple grand by now?

204
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,549
只有幾千就好了
I wish.

205
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,569
我還有其他開支
I had to finance the whole thing

206
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:44,839
當時還拿的是收發室工資
and was only making mailroom money.

207
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,039
還剩一萬五沒有還完
I've got ‭like $15,000 left.

208
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,659
斯韋卡特還真是想挖你啊
Schweikart wants you bad, huh?

209
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,089
但是  吉米
But, J -- but, Jimmy,

210
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,329
你找我有什么事
Did you have something you needed?

211
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,069
不不  就打電話問問
No, no. I was just checking in.

212
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:55,689
一會兒見  好嗎
Uh, I'll see you later, okay?

213
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,439
如果你表現好的話
If you play your cards right.

214
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,279
拜拜
Bye.

215
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,499
奧馬爾  你在哪
Omar, where are you?

216
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,979
奧馬爾  幫我寫封信行嗎
Omar, would you be so kind as to take a letter for me?

217
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,759
"最親愛的克利福德"  不  太過了
"Dearest Clifford..." No, that's too much.

218
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,839
"親愛的克利福"
"Dear Cliff..."

219
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,359
你覺得應該叫克利福德還是克里福
Whaddaya think -- Clifford or Cliff?

220
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,909
我不知道  要看是什么信吧
I don't -- it depends on what the letter is.

221
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:26,669
沒事  你看著寫吧
That's fine. Treat yourself.

222
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:29,279
親愛的  加什么都可以
Uh, "Dear..." Whoever you put in.

223
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,659
接下來  "我的心沉重得就像"
Continuing -- ‭uh, "My heart is heavy as --"

224
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,249
不行  聽起來像是身體出狀況了
No, that sounds like a medical condition.

225
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,299
這么寫吧
Let's go with, um,

226
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,969
"我懷著沉重的心情"  好吧
"It is with a heavy heart," Okay?

227
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:46,439
"我懷著沉重的心情向戴維斯梅因律所
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation

228
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,339
"正式提交辭呈"
"to Davis & Main."

229
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:50,719
用"提交"比"上交"好吧
"Tender" is better than "Submit," Yeah?

230
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,619
你說辭呈嗎
Resignation?

231
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,699
是啊
Yes, sir.

232
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,759
"向戴維斯梅因律所提交...
So, "Tender," Blah, blah, blah, "To Davis & Main.

233
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,499
"在這里工作的日子
"These have been, uh,

234
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:04,099
"是我一生中最有職業成就感的一段時間"
"some of the most professionally satisfying days of my life..."

235
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:08,499
怎么了
What's wrong?

236
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,459
是不是說得有點過了
Do you think ‭I'm laying it on too thick?

237
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,699
不是...
No, um...

238
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:16,459
我只是沒想到你在這里這么受氣
I just didn't realize how unhappy you were here.

239
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,689
不是受氣
Not unhappy, per se.

240
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,509
而是...不開心
More like... Not happy.

241
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,899
我完全沒看出來
I had no idea.

242
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,379
不是你的錯  伙計
‭It's not your fault, buddy.

243
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,309
你很能干
It's just -- you're top-notch.

244
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:30,659
我們寫到哪了
Where were we?

245
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,439
可是你那么努力才爭取到這一切
It's just y-you worked so hard to get here,

246
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,369
現在放棄的話你會失去很多
and it's so much to give up --

247
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:38,139
單說你的特別待遇
I-I mean, the perks alone.

248
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:38,939
是啊
Yeah.

249
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,599
公寓確實...不錯
The apartment is, uh... Yeah.

250
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,219
還有車
And the car.

251
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,519
那輛車整體上是相當不錯的
For the most part, car is pretty sweet.

252
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,789
還有簽約獎金
And the bonus.

253
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,069
獎金已經到手了
The bonus is a done deal.

254
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,529
他們早就把支票給我了
It's -- ‭they already cut me the check.

255
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,549
獎金我可以留著
I get to keep the bonus.

256
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,419
除非你辭職
Not if you quit.

257
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,079
在一定時間內辭職  我記得你的是一年內
Before a certain term -- I think yours is a year --

258
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,949
你就要把錢還回來的
You have to pay the money back.

259
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,529
是...
It's, um...

260
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,389

262
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,909
應該是這兒
I think it's right, uh, there.

263
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,769
我看看
Yeah.

264
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,619
奧馬爾  這個
Omar...That whole, ‭uh,

265
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,519
辭職信的事情
letter-of-resignation thing

266
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,149
我不是認真的  一個字也不作數
that -- I didn't mean that, not a word.

267
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,149
我...
I...

268
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:46,599
我只是
I-I'm so incredibly

269
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,739
壓力太大了
stressed out.

270
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,649
壓力太大
I'm stressed out.

271
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,609
而且  坦白說
And frank-- to be honest,

272
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:56,689
適應戴維斯梅因的工作節奏
it has been more of an adjustment

273
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:00,149
比我預想中更困難
than I expected here at Davis & Main.

274
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,419
所以我有點  別把我剛才說的告訴別人
And so I just -- don't repeat what I said to anyone.

275
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,879
我就覺得有些不對勁
I figured ‭something had to be wrong --

276
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:11,649
肯定不對勁  因為你很喜歡在這里工作吧
I mean, really wrong because you like it here, right?

277
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:12,649
愛死了
I love it.

278
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:16,849
剛剛  就當是一瞬間失去理智吧
It -- call it ?A momentary lapse of reason.

279

我們
And but just --

280
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,209
我們忘了這回事吧
Let's just rewind the tape and, you know, forget this happened.

281
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,359
沒問題  絕對不說出去
Mum's the word. No problem.

282
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,759
我感覺好多了
Yeah, I feel better already.

283
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,169
有時候必須把想說的大聲發泄出來
I -- you know, sometimes, you have to say something out loud

284
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,859
才知道那聽起來有多荒唐
to hear how crazy it sounds.

285

你得用力才行  像這樣
You just got to force it. Yeah!

For Christ's sakes, Jimmy!

00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:55,521
只能倒著來  明白嗎
Backwards only -- solo backward-o, yeah?

306
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:58,231
因為這樣才有吸力  杠桿原理啥的
Because, uh, you've got suction that way, leverage.

307
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,101
這是物理  物理
It's physics -- el physico!

不好意思
Excuse me.

都能聽見嗎  很好
Everyone can hear me? Good.

319
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,131
坦白說  我從沒想到
Frankly, this is not a conversation

320
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,201
在自己的職業生涯中要進行這種講話
I ever thought I would have in my professional career,

321
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:38,081
但我注意到
but it's been brought to my attention

322

洗手間出了狀況
that we have an ongoing situation in the washroom.

323

Someone is not flushing.

Once is an accident -- maybe even twice.

325

三次就形成模式了
Three times -- no, that's a pattern.

326
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,971
而且還不是小便
And we're not talking about a number one.

327
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,831
是的  謝謝你  艾琳
Yes. Thank you, Erin.

328
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,901
我不是來給誰難堪的
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone --

329
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,141
我都不想知道是誰干的  但是...
Nor do I even want to know who did it, but --

330
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,431
克利福德  是我干的
Uh, Cliff, it was me.

331
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,221
吉米  我說了我不想知道
Jimmy, I just said I didn't want to know.

332
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,751
我們需要節約水
Hey, we need the water.

333
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,251
我聽說圣達菲的水位
I read somewhere that the Santa Fe watershed

334
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:06,371
今年下降了五厘米
is down ‭two full inches this year.

335
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,291
每沖一次水
Every time you flush a toilet,

336
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,481
都會浪費一加侖水  一加侖呢
you waste a gallon of water -- a gallon!

337
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,271
還有比不沖水更好的節約方法嗎
What could be greater than this?

338
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,021
那些都是低流馬桶  吉米
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.

339
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:16,661
從現在開始  你要沖水
From now on, flush.

340
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,131
低流  不錯啊
Low-flow -- that's good.

341
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,211
好主意
Good thinking.

342
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,111
什么聲音
What is that?

343
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,491
吉米  里面怎么回事
Jimmy, ‭what's goin' on in there?

344
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:15,061
吉米
Jimmy!

345
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,641
你隔著門也能聽見嗎
Oh, you could hear this through the door?

346
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,051
我沒注意到  抱歉
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

347
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:20,711
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

348
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,231
我接受了你的建議
Uh, I took your advice.

349
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:23,691
我在釋放壓力
I'm blowing off steam.

350
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,511
釋放壓力
Blowing off steam?

351
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,991
是啊  就像你彈吉他一樣
Yeah, yeah, like you and your guitar, you know?

352
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,611
不得不說  你說得沒錯
Um, I got to say -- you're right.

353
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,801
這非常有助于緩解壓力
I mean, ‭it really helps with stress.

354
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,241
聲音不怎么好聽  但我剛學
I know I don't sound very good, but I'm just learning.

355
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:38,151
我聽說關鍵是要一直讓這個氣囊充氣
I heard that the key is you have to keep this bag inflated.

356
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:39,331
夠了
Enough!

357
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,891
趕緊給我放下來
Put that down. Now.

358
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,621
你來我辦公室一趟
I want you in my office.

359
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:53,601
你贏了
You win.

360
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:55,751
我贏了什么
What do I win?

361
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:56,931
你被炒了
You're fired.

362
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,221
什么  克利福德  如果是因為那個風笛...
What? Cliff, if this is about the bagpipes --

363
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:01,551
不是因為那個風笛
It's not about the bagpipes.

364
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,671
當然是因為風笛了
Well, of course it's the bagpipes.

365
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,171
是因為風笛  是因為不沖水
It's the bagpipes, ‭and it's the not flushing

366
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,081
還因為你這身...扎眼的所謂西裝
And this -- this optical migraine you call a business suit.

367
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:12,671
是因為...是因為你想保住你的獎金
It's about -- it's about you keeping your bonus.

368
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,071
都是因為這個
That's what this is about.

369
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:17,201
你最近一直在溫習合同法吧
Been brushing up on ‭your contract law, haven't you?

370
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:18,911
你顯然想離開這里
You want outta here, clearly,

371
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,301
但你不能辭職  否則獎金不保
But you can't just up and quit and expect to keep your bonus.

372
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,441
如果我因為你的不當行為解雇你
And if I fire you for cause --

373
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,361
在你拍廣告時我就應該炒了你...
Like I should have done for the TV commercial --

374
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,531
獎金也沒有
Again, no bonus.

375
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:26,861
但是
However,

376
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:30,181
如果無緣無故  就因為你是個混蛋而解雇你
if I fire you not for cause but for being an all-around jackass...

377
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:32,481
你就能得逞了
Yeah.. ‭Hurray for you.

378
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,801
如果你認為我有什么瀆職行為...
If you think there's been some malfeasance here --

379
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,991
省省吧
Oh, save it.

380
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,511
我可以和你爭  但我不想為你浪費時間
I could fight you on this, but you're not worth my time.

381
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,771
你最好趕緊走人
I'd rather just have you gone.

382
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,541
你這么想我很抱歉
I'm sorry you feel that way.

383
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,021
我去...收拾東西
I'll just, uh... pack up.

384
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:52,061
首先...行行好
First... Do me the favor

385
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,301
不要把我當傻子
of not treating me like a fool for once.

386
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:57,121
告訴我  我到底對你哪里不好了
Tell me -- ‭how exactly did I mistreat you?

387
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,111
我到底做了什么讓你這樣對我
What did I do to deserve is kind of behavior?

388
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:01,311
我們給了你機會  鼓勵你發展
We gave you opportunities, encouraged you to excel.

389
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,681
給你配了車  配了房
We got you a car, an apartment.

390
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,451
還有黃檀木辦公桌
Hell, that cocobolo desk.

391
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,101
你在這兒看到過那樣的桌子嗎
Do you see a desk like that in here?

392
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,211
你根本沒有認真考慮
You never gave this a chance.

393
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:09,221
為什么
Why?

394
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,181
我努力想要適應  真的
I tried to make it work -- really, I-I did.

395
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:17,531
我只是...不適合這里
I'm just... a square peg.

396
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:20,171
如果你早就知道  為什么還要接受這份工作
If you knew that, why did you take the job?

397
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:25,051
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,311
那張桌子多少錢
How much was the desk?

399
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,061
七千
$7,000.

400
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,631
我會給你開張支票
I'll write you a check.

401
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,541
隨便  雖然不知道有什么用
Fine, ‭for whatever good that does.

402
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:40,381
帶上你的桌子離開這里
Take your desk and get out.

403
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:47,141
克利福德  不管怎么樣  我覺得你是一個好人
Hey, Cliff, for what it's worth, I think you're a good guy.

404
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,491
不管怎么樣  我覺得你是一個混蛋
For what it's worth, I think you're an asshole.

405
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:25,835
{\an8}哈姆林先生
抱歉通知你  我將辭去

406
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,345
門開著
Uh, yeah, it's open.

407
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:45,425
-吉米  -我能和你談談嗎
- Jimmy. ‭- Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute?

408
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,175
霍華德知道你來嗎
Does Howard know you're here?

409
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,145
當然不知道  我溜進來的
God, no. I snuck in.

410
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,115
好吧  但是快點
Well, uh, yeah, but make it quick.

411
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:54,785
其實  我們能不能去會議室談
Actually, can we, uh, talk in the conference room?

412
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:55,735
為什么
Why?

413
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:57,485
這樣更正式
It's just more appropriate.

414
00:22:57,485 --> 00:23:00,785
四點之前沒人要開會  我看過了
Um, no one's gonna need it till 4:00 -- I checked.

415
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:02,745
行嗎
Please?

416
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:04,115
最多十分鐘
10 minutes, tops.

417
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,705
你先請
After you.

418
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,745
坐吧
‭Have a seat.

419
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:11,685
怎么...怎么回事
What -- what is going on?

420
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:12,655
說吧
Spill it.

421
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:16,365
好吧
Okay.

422
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,785
斯韋卡特考科利會幫你付清欠哈姆林麥吉爾的債務
Schweikart and Cokely will pay your debt to HHM

423
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:22,185
并在兩年之后將你提拔為合伙人吧
and make you a partner in two years, correct?

424
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:23,375
顯然是的
Apparently.

425
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,695
是這么約定的
That's the deal, yes.

426
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,565
怎么了
Why?

427
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:29,005
要不要考慮一個更好的工作機會
Would you entertain a better offer?

428
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,435
誰給的  哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所嗎
From whom -- HHM?

429
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:33,515
我
From me.

430
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,695
我明天就讓你成為合伙人
I'll make you a partner tomorrow.

431
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,555
以此為證
Consider that proof of concept --

432
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,615
韋克斯勒麥吉爾合伙律所
Wexler-Mcgill, partners at law.

433
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,385
你和我一起
You and me, together.

434
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,185
斯韋卡特可以幫你償還債務  我也可以
If Schweikart can pay your debt, so can I.

435
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,975
再加上我的簽約獎金
And with my signing bonus,

436
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:53,845
你就可以從頭開始了
you'll have a clean slate.

437
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,165
前程無限好
The sky's the limit.

438
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:56,895
我倆合作很好的
Hey, we're good together.

439
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,255
這你知道的
You know that.

440
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,845
還猶豫什么
So, what's stopping us?

441
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,005
全身心投入  做自己的老板
Let's jump in with both feet, be our own bosses,

442
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,505
共建屬于我們的未來
build our own future.

443
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,065
"做自己的老板"
"Be our own bosses."

444
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:10,545
哪里來的委托人呢
What about clients?

445
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,685
你剛剛簽了梅薩維德銀行  是吧
Mesa Verde just signed with you, didn't they?

446
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,465
想把他們挖走很難
It'll be a hard sell to take them with me.

447
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,715
那就再找一個梅薩維德銀行
So, then there will be another Mesa Verde.

448
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,795
這全都靠你  金
That was all you, Kim.

449
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:21,125
你能簽下這個  再簽一個有何難
You did it once. You can do it again.

450
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,225
你說得輕松
You make it sound easy.

451
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:27,725
不  你面前的這個男人
No. You're talking to a guy

452
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,795
可是在美甲店里蝸居了多年的
who lived ‭in the back of a nail salon.

453
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:32,385
當然不容易  肯定要付出很多心血和汗水
No, this is gonna be a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears --

454
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:33,975
至少一開始肯定很艱難
at least, at the start.

455
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,665
但是最終我們會擁有完全屬于我們的生意
But in the end, we'll have a practice that is 100% ours,

456
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:38,935
很值得
that's worth it.

457
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,665
也有可能失敗  兩手空空
Or we fail ‭and end up with nothing.

458
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,325
你說得對  這就是一場賭博
Well, you're right -- it's a gamble.

459
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,395
這是一場豪賭
It's a big one.

460
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,365
沒錯  但你是把賭注壓在自己身上
Yeah, ‭but you're betting on yourself,

461
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,185
就我看來  你贏的幾率很大
and from where I sit, the odds are in your favor.

462
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:50,985
你是一名出色的律師
You're an amazing lawyer.

463
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:53,235
這是你向世界展示的機會
This is your chance to show the world that.

464
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:58,835
那我為什么不去斯韋卡特呢
So, why not go to Schweikart?

465
00:24:58,845 --> 00:24:59,665
他們也會讓我成為合伙人
They'll make me partner,

466
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,405
而且他們律所可靠  聲譽又好
and they are a solid, respectable firm.

467
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:02,525
這一點無可否認
You can't deny that.

468
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,915
你不該只滿足于這樣的橫向調動
You deserve more than just a lateral move.

469
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:07,295
這就是斯韋卡特代表的
Bottom line -- that's what Schweikart represents.

470
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,785
他只是另一個霍華德·哈姆林罷了
He's just Howard Hamlin by a different name.

471
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,365
你一直在說我和斯韋卡特
You keep talking about me and Schweikart.

472
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,875
那你和戴維斯梅因怎么辦
What about you and Davis & Main?

473
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,225
結束了  我今天辭職了
That's over. I quit today.

474
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,925
嚴格來講  是我被炒了
Well, technically, I got fired.

475
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:20,295
怎么了
What happened?

476
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,005
互相看不順眼  而且由來已久
It was mutual and a long time coming.

477
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:25,005
這份工作從一開始就不適合我
That job was never the right fit for me.

478
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,195
這份才是
This is.

479
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:32,815
如果我們倆要成為律所合伙人
If we're gonna be law partners,

480
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,155
有一件事我需要確認
I need to know one thing.

481
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:38,925
你會是什么樣的律師
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

482
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,455
我不是指你要專攻哪一方面  我指的是
I don't mean what kind of law are you gonna practice. I mean

483
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:45,715
你會照章辦事嗎
are you gonna play it straight,

484
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,545
還是繼續
or are you gonna...

485
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:49,905
耍各種花招
be colorful?

486
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:54,575
我會照章辦事  絕不出格
I'm gonna play it straight, right down the line.

487
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:57,775
我會萬分謹慎
I'm gonna dot every "I," and I'm gonna cross every...

488
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:10,285
如果我不能做自己  那這又有什么意義
There's no point in me doing this if I can't be myself.

489
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:14,085
每一次我照著別人的方法來做事
Every time I try to do things someone else's way,

490
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:15,305
我都會把事情搞砸
it blows up in my face.

491
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,645
在戴維斯梅因律所就是如此
That's what happened at Davis & Main.

492
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:19,035
看看結果如何
Look how that turned out.

493
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,965
我差點毀了你的事業  惹毛了所有人
I almost derailed your career, pissed everyone off.

494
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:27,205
我一直都努力活在別人的期望中
I've been trying to be the person someone else wants me to be for...

495
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:29,135
我也不知道有多久了
I don't know how long.

496
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:30,775
一開始是查克
I mean, first, it was Chuck,

497
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:33,885
然后是你  這并不是你的錯
then it was you -- ‭and that's not your fault.

498
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,165
那是我自己的選擇
That was my choice.

499
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:37,055
但是如果我們要這么做
But if we're gonna do this,

500
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,505
我要做我自己
I got to go into it as me.

501
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,075
所以  沒錯
So, yeah.

502
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:44,485
我估計會繼續耍小花招吧
Colorful, I guess.

503
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:46,425
你覺得怎么樣
What do you say?

504
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:49,925
我只是
I just...

505
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,445
我不明白為什么我倆非要在一起工作呢
I don't see ‭why it's so important to you that we work together.

506
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:55,985
我們已經...
I mean, we're already...

507
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:57,945
你為什么還要拉我入伙呢
‭Why do you need me for this?

508
00:26:57,945 --> 00:27:00,625
我不是需要你  我想要你
I don't need you -- I want you.

509
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:03,645
你已經擁有我了...
You've got me...

510
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,265
只不過不是合伙人
Just not as a law partner.

511
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,645
我得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

512
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:21,965
你沒事吧
You okay?

513
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:22,775
沒事
Yeah.

514
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:24,705
沒事  我很好
No, I'm fine.

515
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:27,165
去吧
Go on.

516
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:31,405
那一會見
See you later? ‭

517
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,005
一會見
Yeah.

518
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:43,305
你也看到了  這房子可以拎包入住
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

519
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:45,625
在過去三年里已經重新裝修過了
And they've renovated within the past three years --

520
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,945
地板和廚房都是新的
new floors, new kitchen.

521
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,625
空間也很大
And it's a good amount of space.

522
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,825
你覺得這房子不算太過吧
It's not too much house, you think?

523
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,495
一點也不過分
No, not at all.

524
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,665
看看那后院啊
And look at that backyard.

525
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:01,775
他們把小房子都留在這了
They're leaving the playhouse.

526
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:03,155
是不是很棒
Isn't that amazing? ‭

527
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:05,345
凱莉肯定愛死了
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

528
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:08,365
-她肯定進去了就不想出來  -是吧
- You'll never get her outta there. - I know, right?

529
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,195
最重要的是
And the most important part --

530
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:12,865
周圍的學校很不錯  鄰居也很棒
the schools are good and the neighborhood is great.

531
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,845
我打了本警區的電話  問了犯罪率
I called the local precinct and asked about the crime stats --

532
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,555
這里是市里最低的之一
they're some of the lowest in the city.

533
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,515
而且  他的語氣很好
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.

534
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,505
聽起來很負責任
Like, they sounded really responsive.

535
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:22,965
這很不錯
That sounds perfect.

536
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:24,095
是的
Yeah.

537
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,155
你喜歡嗎
Do you like it?

538
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,365
你開心我就開心
If you're happy, I'm happy.

539
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:29,535
你喜歡嗎
Do you like it?

540
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:32,055
是  我喜歡  但是我
Yeah, I do, but I'm --

541
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:35,215
-但是什么  -需要一大筆錢
- But what? - ‭It's a lot of money.

542
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,765
我知道我一直重復  但確實要很多錢
I know -- I'm like ‭a broken record, but it is.

543
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:38,775
這你不必擔心
You don't worry about that.

544
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:40,405
無論多少錢都要買下來
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.

545
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:42,275
-麥克  -我說真的
- Mike. - ‭Hey, I'm serious.

546
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:43,825
別多想了
Not another thought.

547
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,985
你想要就買吧
If you want it, it's yours.

548
00:28:56,905 --> 00:28:57,615
房子怎么樣
How we looking?

549
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:59,655

-成交  -非常好
- Let's do it. ‭- Fantastic.

551
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:03,625
你們還有時間嗎
Do you have another hour?

552
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,805
我們可以去辦公室
We could go down to the office,

553
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:06,385
申請貸款預批之類的
get the pre-approval in order, all that.

554

Sure. See you in a few.

556
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:13,165
我終于能松口氣了
Oh, I feel like I can finally breathe.

557
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,885
行  我很高興
Good. I'm glad.

558
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:18,715
你想坐我的車嗎
You wanna ride together?

559
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,295
不  我跟著你開
No, I'll follow you over.

車不錯
Car looks good.

連剮蹭的痕跡都看不出來
Wouldn't even know ‭you so much as scratched it.

562
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:26,625
沒錯  修車工技術好

No problem.

568
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,985
小心魚缸
Watch the fish tank.

To the left.

這東西要怎么處理
‭What should I... do with this?

577
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:28,265
丟到路邊去
Dump it ‭on the side of the road --

578
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:30,265
我當初也是在路邊撿的
That's where I got it in the first place.

579

-給  伙計  -不用

-我想喝一杯  -不用了
- I know I could use one. - ‭No.

謝謝
Thanks.

600
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,895
簡易判決嗎  是的  我處理過六起
Summary judgments? Uh, yes. I've handled six.

601
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:30,275
其實最近一起非常復雜
Actually, one recently was quite complex.

602
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:34,115
一起訴訟案  離婚不順造成的
It was a litigation -- the result of a nasty divorce.

603
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,045
我的委托人起訴她以前的公司
My client was suing her former company,

604
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:38,285
她和前夫在協議書中分了該公司的財產
which she and her ex had split in their settlement.

605
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:41,735
其中的問題讓我研究了幾周判例法
The issues involved had me chasing case law for weeks.

606
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:44,065
-誰審理的  -皮特曼法官
- Who heard it? ‭- Judge Pittman.

607
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:47,245
他很難纏啊
That guy -- he's a handful, huh?

608
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,205
他有時候是很難搞
Well, he can be a tough nut to crack,

609
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,095
但他做出了有利于我的判決
but he did rule in my favor.

610
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:54,185
行了  別總說法律了
All right, ‭enough about law, law, law.

611
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,365
我們知道你很棒
We know you're good.

Tell us about Kim Wexler.

你從收發室干起
You started in the mailroom.

615
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:02,435
-是吧  -沒錯
- Is that right? - ‭I did.

616
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,855
這大概是十年前的事了
I was there almost, ‭uh, well, 10 years ago now.

617
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:08,325
一步一步往上爬  很不錯
Pulled yourself up by your bootstraps -- I like that.

618
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:10,765
你上過新墨西哥大學法學院  你是新墨西哥人嗎
I see you went to UNM law. Are you from New Mexico?

619
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,045
老家不在這
Not originally.

620
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,675
我是中西部人
I'm from the Midwest,

621
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,645
地圖上都沒有的小鎮
Just a tiny, little town barely on the map --

622
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,555
堪薩斯和內布拉斯加交界處
You know, ‭that Kansas-Nebraska border.

623
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:20,185
你們肯定沒聽過
You've never heard of it.

624
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,225
那你怎么到這兒來了
So, what brought you here?

625
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:24,705
也許...
I guess...

626
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:30,075
有一天  我回顧人生  回顧曾經的我
Uh, one day, ‭I just looked around at my life, at who I was,

627

我意識到  如果繼續走那條路的話

哪條路
Which way was that?

629

最好的情況
Best case?

630
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:38,945
可能是嫁給鎮上開加油站的那個人
Probably married to the guy that ran the town gas station.

631
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:41,135
也可能是在辛奇丁奇當個收銀員
Maybe cashiering down at the Hinky Dinky.

632
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,105
-辛奇什么  -辛奇丁奇

不用  我很高興你把我和霍華德弄混了
No, no, no, no. I'm happy to be confused with Howard.

這次我想要臺移動攝影車
Oh, and I want a dolly this time.

What kind? Western? Hustler? Pee-wee?

669
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,205
在女士面前注意措辭

Now, go on. Get outta here.

抱歉
Sorry. ‭

677
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:15,965
你終于有張黃檀木辦公桌了

我終于有張黃檀木辦公桌了

就這個
This.

682

個體律所  又一次給自己打工

我不會接受那份工作
I'm not taking the job.

Why not?

693
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,995
你說得對  我應該做自己的老板了
You were right -- it's time for me to be my own boss.

694
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:57,565
個體律所
Solo practice.

695
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:02,925
怎么  你又覺得這么做不好了
‭What? You don't think it's a good idea now?

696
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:06,385
別告訴我你改變主意了
Don't tell me ‭you've changed your mind.

697

不  我很驚訝而已
No, ‭I'm -- I'm surprised, is all.

好
Good.

704
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:24,865
為此  我有個提議
To that end... I have a pitch for you.

705
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:36,005
不是韋克斯勒麥吉爾  而是韋克斯勒
Not Wexler-McGill, but Wexler...

706
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:38,635
以及麥吉爾
and McGill.

707
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:42,345
我們找間辦公室  平攤物業費
We find an office, ‭share the housekeeping costs,

708
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:44,805
房租  電費  一切
the rent, electricity -- everything.

709
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:47,925
但我是律師金·韋克斯勒
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,

710
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,985
你是律師吉米·麥吉爾
and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law,

711
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:52,305
我們都可以按自己意愿執業
both free to practice as we see fit.

712
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:55,975
同一屋檐下兩間律所
Separate firms under one roof?

713
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,565
我們都要出城  為什么不拼車呢
We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?

714
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:02,345
你按你的方式來  我按我的來
You do things your way, and I do them mine.

715
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:03,605
我們有自由
We'll have freedom,

716
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:06,345
但也不會孤軍奮戰
but we aren't each trying to go it alone.

717
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,675
不是合伙人  而是一起工作的個體律師
Not partners -- ‭solo practitioners, together.

718
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:15,065
你覺得怎么樣
What do you think?

719
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,535
我不知道說什么好
I don't know what to say.

720
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:21,085
說同意吧
