[Jackson] You ready?

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
[Viv] Ready as I'll ever be.

175

[rock music playing]

176
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Okay.

177
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
[Viv] He's looking at us.

178
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Act like I've said something really funny.

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080

Okay, too much. Too much. Reign it in.

182
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,840
He's making his way over.
Remember what I said, all right? Be cool,

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
- be calm, be confident.
- Bev.

184
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
- Hi.
- Whoa.

[scoffs]

186
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,720
Honestly, don't worry about it, Bev.
It's fine. It happens all the time.

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,960
You keep calling her "Bev."
Her name's actually Viv.

188
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,920
Viv.

189
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm so sorry.

190
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
I did know that.
I'm just terrible with names.

191

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600

- Friends. We're just friends.

193
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,040

194
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah. Right? Well, uh...

195
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
what can I help you with, Viv?

196
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,840
<i>War of the Ring.</i>

197
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Oh, I love that game,
but we've just sold our last one.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,240
- [inhales] Shit.
- [Dex] Tell you what,

199
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,200
maybe I could take your number down,

200
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,160
and I can let you know
when it comes back in stock.

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Yeah.

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,120
That's me. [chuckles]

203
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll never forget the look on their faces.

Staring at me.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
The man who was supposed to be
their father...

206

in the middle of Hamleys.

207
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
That's my biggest regret.

208
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Well, thank you for sharing, Nathan.

209
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,720
That was... very touching.

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,120
I'd like to share. [clears throat]

211
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,800
- I'm Erin and I'm an addict.
- [man] Hello.

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,800
[Erin] I've been clean for 13 months now.

213
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,720
And, you know, every day is a struggle.

214
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
This is my daughter, Maeve, here too.

215
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,800
She's very angry with me,

216
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
but I understand her anger,

217
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,640
and I want her to know
it's okay to blame me

218
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,360
because so much of her pain is my fault.

219
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
But I also want her to know
that life hasn't been easy for me either.

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,520
I have ended up in many bad situations
in my life,

221
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,680
but I was just doing the best that I could
with the tools I had at the time.

222
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
Maeve...

223
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,520
I will never forgive myself
for abandoning you and your brother.

224
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,480
And I just hope...

225
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,160
you'll be able to find it in yourself
to forgive me.

226
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
You're unbelievable.

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
- What's wrong?
- It's all about you, isn't it, Erin?

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,240
That wasn't an apology.
That was just another excuse.

229
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,280
[sighs]

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,280
You don't end up in bad situations.
You make bad choices.

233
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,760
- Can you give me a hand, please?
- Why would I do that... sucker?

234
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,560
Come on. It was pretty funny.

235
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
You don't laugh much, do you?

Is that your <i>schtick?</i>

238
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,120
Well, come and have a look if you like.

239
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm not interested.

240
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,880
Except you kind of are.

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm not.

[Isaac] My brother and I,
we teach this class once a week.

- Where did you guys learn how to dance?
- Yeah, you know, around and about.

Happened in the army.

It's not the 1960s anymore.

261
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,800
This week's focus
is on the pleasure points

262
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,600
inside the vagina.

263
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,840
Now, the primary pleasure point,

264
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,680
if you want to refer
to your leaflets, yes,

265
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
is the clitoris,

266
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,440
which can be found at the crest
of the labia majora.

but, um...

- Yes.
- Oh, yes, I was wondering...

270
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,040
if your bike has been sitting
in the garden for six years,

271
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,880
it's probably going to be quite rusty,
isn't it?

272
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,640

Yes.

What I'm asking is,

275
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,840
if you haven't been touched
in a long time,

276
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,640
are you still going to feel anything?

277
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,040
I can assure you, vaginal pleasure
does not diminish with age

278
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920

347
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,680
Uh...

348
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,360
- Yeah, um...
- Everything all right, Dad?

349
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah, just, uh, you know,
just getting my...

350
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,400
my bearings.

351
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
This is faulty. Have you got a map?

352
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,760
Mm-hmm.

353
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,040
Um, do you want to use my phone?

354
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,800
No, a map is just fine.

355
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Yeah. Uh...

356
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,000
This way.

357
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,120
Yeah, it is definitely this way.

358
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,840
Maybe the drinking was a bad idea.

359
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,920
[thunder rumbling in the distance]

360
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
Have you ever had a weird dream?

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,720
[cash register beeping, tray opens]

362
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Oi!

363
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,000
- I'm talking to you.
- I don't dream.

364
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,320
- Everyone dreams.
- No, I've smoked too much weed.

365
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
What about a sex dream?

366
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,000
- About another guy?
- Look, I said I don't dream. Okay?

367
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,040
I had a sex dream last night about a girl.

368
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,960
Even though we didn't actually have sex,
we just kissed.

369
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,960
- I just can't stop thinking about it.
- Dreams aren't real.

370
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,720
That's why they're called dreams.

371
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
Do you think it means something
if I'm having sex dreams about girls?

372
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,280
I don't know.

373
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,080
Go and ask Google like everyone else.

374
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
You didn't answer my question before.

375
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
Where'd you learn to dance?

376
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,640
Well, we lived with this lady for a bit,

377
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,240
ex-ballroom champion. She was horrible,

378
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
but she had rhythm, so...

379
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,840
What do you mean "for a bit"?

380
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Foster families never keep
the disabled kid around too long.

381
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Make a sad face and I will ram you.

382
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,520
[chuckles]

383
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,320
I keep seeing your mum coming in
and out of NA.

384
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
She looks like a character.

385
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,840
[chuckles]
Yeah, well, that's none of your business.

386
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Cynthia said that she pissed off
a few years ago.

387
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
- Junkies are the worst.
- She's been clean for two years.

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah, we've all heard that one before.

389
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
You don't know me...

390
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,760
or my mum, okay?

391
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
Oh, I thought we we're going to bond.
Orphan to orphan.

392
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, you were wrong.

393
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,320
Hey, I didn't mean to cross a line.
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,360
Maybe your mum's different. I mean...

395
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,280
Nothing changes,
if nothing changes, right?

396
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,480
Did you just make that up?

397
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,280
No. That's the quote
they use on their poster.

398
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,000
I think it should say, "Once an addict..."

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,160
always an addict."

400
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,480
You're a real dick, you know?

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Who do you notice more when you walk
down the street? Men or women?

402
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,520
Both.

403
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,240
- I thought everyone did.
- Well, I only notice girls.

404
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
They're everywhere.

405
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,760
Um...

406
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm a pansexual, apparently.

407
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,920
What, like...

408
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,320
fucking pots and pans?

409
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,200
I knew a guy who...

410
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,960
used to like to stick his dick
in the suction pipe of a vacuum cleaner.

411
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
It's normal.

412
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,040
Pansexual means that you're attracted
to the person, not the sex or gender.

413
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,360
Uh, it's about the connection you have
with the human being,

414
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,080
not with their genitalia.

415
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,560
Huh.

416
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
Kind of makes sense, actually.

417
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,320
It doesn't make sense to me.

418
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,840
[knocking at door]

419
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,520
[exhales] You were supposed to be here
three hours ago.

420
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,040
Yeah, I walked.

421
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm really enjoying walking at the moment.
It's so evaporating.

422
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,000
- Invigorating?
- Yeah. That's what I said.

423
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,160
[exhales]

424
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
[seductive music playing on stereo]

425
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Oh, sorry. That was an accident.

426
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
[chuckles] Okay.

427
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,400
Ah...

428
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
Do you not want me to?

429
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,320
What makes you think I don't?

430
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,240
- You keep slapping me in the head.
- Maybe we can watch a film or something?

431
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah.

432
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you sure everything's okay?

433
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,760
I feel like you've been acting
a bit strange

434
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,360
since what happened with the bus.

435
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,800
- Do you want to talk about it?
- I'm fine, Steve.

436
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm just tired from my walk.
Go and get the laptop.

437
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
[shower running]

438
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
[buzzing]

439
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,120
Ah...

440
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,440
[breathing deeply]

441
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,040
[Jackson]
...there's something to be jealous of.

442
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,960
- So, when he texts you...
- He won't text me.

443
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
He will definitely text you.

444
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,240
And you will definitely make him wait

445
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,600
at least two and a half hours
for a response.

446
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,560
- Why so much game playing?
- Only at the start.

447
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,680
Eventually, you will just like each other
for your personalities.

448
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,080
When have you ever liked anyone
for their personality?

449
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,880
I did.

450
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
I liked someone quite a lot.

451
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Yeah, I'm sure that you're pining over
Maeve Wiley's love of feminist literature.

452
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
It had nothing to do with
the size of her boobs.

453
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Why are you so chippy?

454
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,120
Because guys like you
never see girls like me.

455
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,960
All your conquests look like
they've been made in lab.

456
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,120
It's transparent.

457
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
I really liked Maeve, you know.

458
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,280
What was it about her
that you liked so much?

459
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
It's just the feeling, isn't it?

460
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,680
I can't really explain it.

461
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,160
"Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind,

462
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,920
and therefore,
is winged Cupid painted blind."

463
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,880
- <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>
- Yeah, you know.

464
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,840
So, I've been reading his other plays.

465
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Not sure about all the pixie stuff,
but he's all right.

466
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,600
I think you should tell your mum
that you're in a school play.

467
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
She'll be really proud.

468
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,560
Sorry, did you just give me
a compliment just then? Or...

469
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,680
If you stop being so lazy
and learn your lines.

470
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

471
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you for today.

472
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,200
It's all right.

473
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,800
Bye.

474
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,560
Hey, Viv?

475
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah?

476
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,440
I <i>do </i>see you, by the way.

477
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,560
I see a girl that gave Dex her number.

478
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,720
[chuckles]

479
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,800
[Jackson laughs]

480
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,160
[Viv] See you later.

481
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,400
Two and a half hours.

482
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,320
[Viv] Okay.

483
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,880
[thunder rumbling]

484
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,000
Dad, we're lost, all right?

485
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,520
We are not lost.

486
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,320
What does the flipping map say?

487
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,280
It says it's a cheap piece of shit.

488
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
It is okay to admit we're lost.

489
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm not going to admit anything
because we are not lost.

490
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,120
[Eric] Guys!

491
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
Guys!

492
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,960
- Guys, I think I can see our stuff.
- Ah, you see!

493
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,800
I told you we were not lost.

494
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,160
Oh, my God!

495
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,560
My hat!

496
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,800
All right, let's just get these tents up.

497
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,360
They are pop-up, right?

498
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,280
Yeah, you just gotta open the bag,
and then, you just...

499
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,840
And then it just pops up.

500
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,280
You need to take the... strap.

501
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,960
[Remi grunting]

502
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,920
[Remi grunting]

503
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,720
Dad?

504
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
All right, you think you're winning?

505
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,040
Do you? I have been through
so much worse than you.

506
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,680
How many bloody doctorates
have you got? You...

507
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,360
piece of fucking shit!

508
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,880
Pop-up, my arse!

509
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
Why don't we get a hotel?

510
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,920
No, we're not getting a fucking hotel.

511
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,440
Hey, two rooms, please...

512
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,800
Janine.

513
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
[inhales]

514
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,120
What are they for?

515
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
Just felt like buying them.

516
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,760
They're far too expensive.

517
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
[sighs]

518
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,480
I want a divorce.

[door closes]

521
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,480
You were right.

522
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
I did make choices.

523
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
And I can't take them back.

524
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,760
And nothing you can say
will ever make me feel

525
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
any worse than I already do.

526
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,840

529
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
I haven't got all night, though, so...

530

[phone vibrating]

531
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,240
- Why'd you keep ignoring Rahim?
- 'Cause I'm hanging with you.

532
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,440
I don't want to be one of these people
that're suddenly obsessed

533
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,520
- with who they're dating.
- Well, that's very sweet, Eric,

534
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,000
but why are you ignoring him?
Didn't he ask you to be his boyfriend?

535
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Okay. [laughs]

536
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,280
I have to tell you something.

537
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,120
Okay? But you can't be mad
I didn't say anything before.

538
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,320
Do you remember
I got detention last term with Adam?

539
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,360
Well...

540
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,120
he gave me a blowjob.

541
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
[laughs]

542
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,440
And since he's been back, we've been
going on all these late-night walks

543
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,360
where we go and smash stuff
and then we kiss...

544
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
a lot and... and it's amazing.

545
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,680
Why is your face not moving?

546
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,640
Because he... he bullied you...

547
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,480
- for years, Eric. He's a horrible person.
- No, but people can change.

548
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,480
If he's changed, then why is he making you
sneak around at night?

549
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880
Well, it's romantic.

550
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
Something you wouldn't know about
because you're too busy

551
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,960
pretending to have feelings
for your girlfriend,

552
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,360
when everyone knows
that you're actually in love with Maeve.

553
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,400
- No, take that back.
- You take back what you said.

554
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,440
- What about Rahim?
- Oh, my God.

555
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,360
He's not ashamed to be with you.

556
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,360
- Don't pretend to be all "Team Rahim" now.
- What's that supposed to mean?

557
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
I think that that is what this
is really about.

558
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,880
You don't like being
the one left behind for a change.

559
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,560
No, Eric. This is about you
being so self-hating

560
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,360
that you'd let yourself fall for someone
who literally treats you like shit.

561
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,840
Don't therapize me, Otis.

562
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,480
You don't know what my reality is.

563
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,400
Okay.

564
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,920
Do what you want.

565
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,920
Okay? But...

566
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,080
ask yourself...
why have you really been hiding it?

567
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,880
[Remi, shouting]
Why, Delilah? Don't! Don't hang up!

Yeah, Delilah has, uh...

577
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,920
has left me...

578
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,560
for someone else.

579
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,560
Oh, shit.

580
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,480
I'm sorry.

- Yeah, I will. I'm good.

We're always at school.

Where's Otis?

603
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,760
Don't worry... he's with Maeve.
