24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
They've got to stop them in this series.

25
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,050
- Geez! Damn it! - Come on!

26
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,990
In Texas, the Holy Trinity is God, 

27
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,960
football and barbeque,

28
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,530
not necessarily in that order.

29
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,940
I don't care if you win, just cover the damn spread.

30
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,190
Mom, are you betting again?

31
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,130
No.

32
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,430
...fans on their feet,

33
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,890
trying to urge the defense on.

35
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,960
Fourth down.

36
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,120
Gotta punt.

37
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,490
Gotta.

38
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,920
Statistically, always punting on fourth down

39
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,180
makes no sense.

40
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,970
Statistically, you're a dumbass.

41
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,250
When the Aggies give up the ball

42
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,090
on their own five-yard line,

44
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,810
the opposing team has a 92% chance of scoring.

45
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,850
When they punt from deep in their own territory,

46
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,350
the other team still has a 77% chance of scoring.

47
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,360
But since they convert on fourth down 50% of the time,

48
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,390
the math says they should never punt again.

49
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, you can tell me, 

50
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,770
who's his real daddy?

51
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,230
Sheldon, I've been playing and coaching football all my life.

52
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,970
I don't think your math is right.

53
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,360
Really?

54
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,720
Hang on.

55
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,530
No, it's right.

56
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,140
...able to hold A&M to a field goal,

57
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,980
they'll only be down six points.

58
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,130
Is it your dentist?

59
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,060
The little guy with the glasses?

60
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,770
You can tell me.

61
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,480
I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about my mother.

62
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,290
She keeps betting on these football games,

63
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,170
next thing you know, there's an Italian fella

64
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,580
driving off with her pickup truck.

65
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,310
You think Sheldon's right?

66
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,360
About what?

67
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,170
The punting and the math.

68
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,670
I should think so.

69
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,800
He's been doing our taxes since he's six years old.

70
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,780
We never been audited.

71
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,170
That's true.

72
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,900
He even got us that nice refund last year.

73
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,490
How come Mom's not taking me to school?

74
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,700
'Cause once in a while,

75
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,030
your dad wants to spend some time with you.

76
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,850
My little Shel-man.

77
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,060
But Mom's car has a backseat.

78
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,090
Statistically, I'm much safer there.

79
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,870
Hey, I'm glad you brought up statistically.

80
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,400
You think those numbers you talked about for Texas A&M

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,300
would apply to my JV squad?

82
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,190
I don't see why not.

83
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,530
Unlike our former principal, math doesn't discriminate.

84
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,790
You're not thinking about taking his advice, are you?

85
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,170
- Never you mind. - But he's wrong.

86
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,370
Everybody knows you punt on fourth down.

87
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,300
Why does everybody knowing something make it right?

88
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,930
Because.

89
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,450
That's what makes this country great.

90
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,820
Many years later,

91
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,010
my brother would use this same argument

92
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,830
in front of a judge.

93
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,450
He was still convicted for urinating in a phone booth.

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,060
Oh, damn it.

95
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,620
I'll send in the punting team.

96
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Hang on. Hang on.

97
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,840
What?

98
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's go for it.

99
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,430
Why? We got plenty of time.

100
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,880
I know. Still want to go for it.

101
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,750
We're on the 12-yard line. Everybody know you punt.

102
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,520
Why does everybody knowing something make it right?

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,670
But we're on the 12-yard line, Coach.

104
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,270
Okay, Coach says we're going for it.

105
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,590
Stupid brother.

106
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,710
- What? - Nothing.

107
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,780
Power left jumbo on two, on two. Ready, break!

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,280
And your Wolves are going for it on fourth down.

109
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,450
What the hell? Punt!

110
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,770
Statistically, they're better off going for it.

111
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,510
- Says who? - My little boy.

112
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,140
That's why everybody punts.

113
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,100
That was just plain foolishness.

114
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,030
Your little boy's a real genius.

115
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,380
Well, actually he is.

116
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,690
Come on.

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,430
Too many men on the field, defense.

118
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,620
Replay fourth down.

119
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,490
Ah. Thank you, Jesus.

120
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,930
Now, can I send in the punt team?

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,430
Coach?

122
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,130
And they're going for it again.

123
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,140
What the hell? Punt!

124
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,950
Remind me to tell you about the tax refund I got from the IRS.

125
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,480
Set. Hut!

126
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,190
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

127
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,580
Go! Whoo!

128
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,890
Go, go, go! Go!

129
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,310
He's at the 30, the 20, the 10.

130
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,410
Touchdown, Wolves!

131
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,520
I never had any doubt, Coach. Never had any doubt.

132
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,110
Oh, booyah! Yes.

133
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,730
Sweet dreams, baby.

134
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,620
Night, Meemaw.

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,980
Can I ask you a favor?

136
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,520
- Sure. What? - You know those statistics

137
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,020
that you were talking about with your dad?

138
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,810
Could... could that be applied to, say,

139
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,370
who might win the Cowboys-Packers game next week?

140
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,380
And, more specifically, by how much?

141
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,790
I suppose with enough data I could make a reasonable guess.

142
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,050
I don't want a guess, I want to know.

143
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,560
Mom said you're not supposed to gamble.

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,120
Sleep, child!

145
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,420
- Mom? - In here!

146
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll get those numbers to you tomorrow.

147
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,420
Just tucking him in.

148
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,600
I got something for you.

149
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,030
It's dirty.

150
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,690
Well, that's 'cause it's the game ball.

151
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,330
And you earned it, 'cause you helped us win.

152
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,470
Okay, but can you wash it?

153
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,170
Sheldon, your daddy's telling you he's proud of you.

154
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,250
I see. Thank you, Dad.

155
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,010
You're welcome.

156
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,740
I'm still never touching that.

157
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,740
Let's go wipe it off.

158
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,980
For the next five weeks,

159
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,250
I continued to help my father apply statistics

160
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,540
to coach his team.

161
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,080
Not surprisingly, they continued to win,

162
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,150
which changed my status in the school dramatically.

163
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,300
- There he is! - Yo, Sheldon!

164
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,250
Shel-dog!

165
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,970
Math man!

166
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,820
Hey, cutie.

167
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,220
It was a nightmare.

168
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,600
Shel-dog!

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,380
Hugging, hair tousling, high fives.

170
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,770
And as my popularity grew, so did my time aloft.

171
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,480
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

172
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,790
Do you know how popular we are?

173
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,180
- We? - Yeah.

174
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,860
I put the word out I was helping you with the football stats.

175
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,010
And since I'm Asian, they bought it.

176
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,240
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

177
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,910
You're not?

178
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,800
I was touched 82 times this afternoon.

179
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,280
What do you mean, "touched"?

180
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,930
Not inappropriately.

181
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,210
Joyfully.

182
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,890
Affectionately.

183
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,270
A cheerleader hugged me to her bosom.

184
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,010
That's amazing.

185
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,280
No more high fives.

186
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,740
I can't keep washing my hands.

187
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,270
There's my little assistant coach.

188
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,890
Hello, Dad.

189
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,010
You have any more, uh, arithmetic ideas

190
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,040
for next week's game?

191
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,210
I do, but I'm trying to finish my homework.

192
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,670
Looks complicated.

193
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,690
Advanced chemistry. It's not.

194
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,450
What are you guys doing?

195
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,270
Your brother and I are gonna knock around a few ideas

196
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,140
for the Freeport game.

197
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,750
Can I help?

198
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,300
Actually, yeah. Run out to my truck.

199
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,340
There's a little, uh, pocket calculator on my front seat.

200
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,010
I got you a present.

201
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,790
Thought it might help with your figuring.

202
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,940
I don't need a calculator, Dad. I am one.

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,850
Sure.

204
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,340
Go get it anyway.

205
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,440
It's solar-powered.

206
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,530
Can you imagine that?

207
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,070
Georgie, turn that down!

208
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,550
What?

209
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,370
And look at this room. You need to clean this mess up.

210
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,710
I'll get to it later.

211
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,320
No, you'll get to it now.

212
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
I don't feel like it.

213
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,900
Well, your feelings have nothing to do with it.

214
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,690
And stop throwing that ball.

215
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,750
My room bothers you so much, you clean it.

216
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,910
That's it! You are grounded! You hear me?!

217
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,360
The hell?

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,610
There's my little Moonpie.

219
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,060
Did you get a chance to look at this week's games for me?

220
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,600
- Not yet. - You understand there's a little time crunch involved.

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,130
Meemaw's got some outstanding loans I need to pay back.

222
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,260
I'm sorry, I have to finish my homework

223
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,690
and then I have to help my dad.

224
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,220
Come on.

225
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,090
I'm your meemaw.

226
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,380
I make you cookies.

227
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,120
How 'bout a little quid pro quo?

228
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,070
As much as I enjoy your use of Latin, no.

229
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,460
Shelly, time to get ready for bed.

230
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,690
But I'm not done.

231
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,370
Don't you sass me, too, young man.

232
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,440
Brush your teeth and get to bed.

233
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,390
I think your anger might be a little misdirected.

234
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,170
Don't you start with me either.

235
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,200
Now, see, you're still shootin' wide.

236
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,740
Good evening, Mrs. Cooper.

237
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,870
Can I speak to Sheldon?

238
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,440
No, you can't speak to Sheldon.

239
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,100
It's late. He's in bed.

240
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,250
Oh. I was hoping he might like to go to a party with me.

241
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,410
Has everyone lost their mind?

242
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,220
He's a little boy, Tam!

243
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,280
Good night!

244
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,720
Good Lord, that mouth of yours is a machine gun tonight.

245
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,930
What are you doing?

246
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,280
Trying to calculate the odds of the Dolphins

247
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,500
covering the spread next Sunday.

248
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,750
I like dolphins.

249
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,330
They talk out of that hole in their head.

250
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:20,980
Hello.

251
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,510
Tam?

252
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,010
What are you doing here?

253
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,770
Would you like to go to a party with me?

254
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,500
I don't want to go to a party with anyone.

255
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,880
I would!

256
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Please, Sheldon.

257
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,070
It's right across the street.

258
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,530
Just get me in, and you can go back to bed.

259
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,990
I have to ask my mom.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
No need. She knows all about the party.

261
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,590
All right, then.

262
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,870
I need a minute to change.

263
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,240
- Why are you wearing that? - It makes me look older.

264
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,520
Just so we're clear, once you get in,

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,220
I'm going home.

266
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,760
Hey! Sheldon!

267
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,850
What are you doing?

268
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,290
Hey, everybody, check it out! Sheldon's here!

269
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,840
I hope that doesn't wake up the kids.

270
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,270
Should I go over there and say something?

271
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
I think you should.

272
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,020
I was bluffin'.

273
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,290
Don't make me put my socks back on.

274
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,100
Never mind.

275
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,610
Good night.

276
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,330
Good night.

277
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,480
I feel bad about yelling at Georgie.

278
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,200
He deserved it.

279
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,770
You should do it more.

280
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,100
I think he's feeling left out

281
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,590
now that you and Sheldon are spending so much time together.

282
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,540
Are you kiddin' me?

283
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,680
You're always saying to find something in common with Sheldon.

284
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,720
And now that I have, you're telling me I'm ignoring Georgie?

285
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,420
I'm not saying that.

286
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm just reminding you

287
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,910
that you got two sons.

288
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,460
I know.

289
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,920
I also got a daughter I need to spend more time with.

290
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,430
You do.

291
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,150
But I wouldn't worry about her.

292
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,020
She's an angel.

293
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,480
Sheldon! Sheldon! Sheldon!

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,650
- Put me down! - Sheldon! Sheldon!

295
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,070
I said put me down.

296
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,910
Put me down! I'm not enjoying this!

297
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,690
Missy, what are you doing here?!

298
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,050
Cuttin' loose. What are you doing here?

299
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,020
Slowly! Slowly!

300
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,770
Slowly!

301
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,440
You, too?!

302
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,180
Hello, Georgie!

303
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,710
You're not supposed to be here.

304
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,710
Neither are you! You're grounded!

305
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,420
Come on.

306
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,060
Both of you are going home. Now.

307
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,400
- Oh, thank goodness. - Aw.

308
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,300
How's puberty treating you?

309
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,910
Because it is knocking me for a loop.

310
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,720
Right?

311
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,170
Somehow, my parents didn't find out about me partying heartily.

312
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,690
But I did pay a price

313
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,400
for burning the candle at both ends.

315
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,440
I made a mistake on a math test.

316
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,520
In my exhaustion, I did all the calculations in my head,

317
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,090
and, like a common zoo animal, forgot to show my work.

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,400
I just saw one of those girls from the party,

319
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,280
and she acknowledged my existence by doing this.

320
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,880
I've never felt so alive.

321
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,210
Are you okay?

322
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,440
No, I'm not.

323
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,780
Yeah, so?

324
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,070
A B-plus-- that's the beginning of the end.

325
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,400
The end of what?

326
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,740
My life.

327
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,740
If I don't make some changes, who knows how far I'll fall.

328
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,900
I could wind up a drug addict, or a lawyer.

329
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,060
Is it possible you're overreacting?

330
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,110
No. Starting today, I'm done helping the football team.

331
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,300
But if you do that, girls will no longer greet me like this.

332
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,910
I'll greet you like that.

333
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,650
It's not the same.

334
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,620
Extricating myself from this situation

335
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,550
was not going to be easy.

336
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,320
My father was counting on me, Meemaw was counting on me,

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,740
the school was counting on me.

338
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,190
After much thought, I decided to employ

339
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,890
the one strategic maneuver I knew I could count on.

340
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,110
I tattled.

341
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,570
Mom?

342
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,430
Sheldon got a B-plus! That's terrible for him!

343
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm very disappointed in all three of you.

344
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,440
That is right. Missy, this is for your ballet class.

345
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,900
We do not go to parties.

346
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,340
I am very disappointed.

347
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,890
Got to go pick up some equipment for the team; you want to join me?

348
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,210
Can't. I'm grounded.

349
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,880
Yeah, well...

350
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,040
I won't tell if you won't.

351
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,710
Sheldon going?

352
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,230
That little snitch? Absolutely not.

353
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,580
Sheldon still gonna help you with the math?

354
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,360
I don't think so.

355
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,380
But I did hear his little Asian friend can do it.

356
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,230
Hello.

357
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,630
So...

358
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,400
Oilers are a four-point favorite for this Sunday's game,

359
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,630
but it's a home game, so I'm thinking I give the points.

360
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,420
What do you think?

361
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,670
I think I have to tell on you again.

362
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,800
Go ahead. What's your mama gonna do, ground me?

363
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,990
Take the Oilers, give the points.

364
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,800
I love you, Moonpie.

365
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
For the record, the Oilers lost that game

366
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,710
by four touchdowns.

367
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,680
Meemaw never asked for my advice again.

368
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,130
Come on, come on, come on. Damn it!

369
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,640
Okay.

370
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,830
One more time.

371
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,880
Mama needs a new Jet Ski!

372
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,770
And...

373
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,880
rat bastard!

374
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,560
How you doin' there, Connie?

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,310
Hey, Vincent.

376
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,100
What brings you to Louisiana?

377
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,370
Wait, don't tell me.

378
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,010
You're here to see Tony Orlando.

379
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,370
'Fraid not.

380
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,910
Oh, well, you ought to check him out.

381
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,410
He'll, uh, knock your socks off.

382
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,040
I like my socks on.

383
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,620
Connie, you're putting me in a very awkward position.

384
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,140
I won a toaster oven playing keno.

385
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,530
You want it?

386
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,990
I got one.

387
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,690
I want my money.

388
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,440
All right.

389
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,350
Hang on.

390
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,270
That's a very nice jacket.

391
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,000
You're looking dapper.

392
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,040
Hey, they comp my room here.

393
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,390
They do that for you?

394
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,130
Actually, they frown upon my presence here.

395
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,430
Oh. I also get a coupon for the breakfast buffet.

396
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,340
You should look into that.

397
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,840
Constance!

398
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,490
Patience, Vincenzo.

399
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,430
Yes!

400
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,870
All right, now we're talking.

401
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,990
Will you take a down payment in quarters?

402
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,110
Do I have a choice?

403
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,360
Start scoopin'.

404
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,090
I got to go see Tony Orlando.

405
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,950
Hey, I need another cup!
