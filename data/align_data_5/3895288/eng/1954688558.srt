there was this guy named Chet.

225
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,187
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

226

some money.

227
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:46,651
He might have slept with my wife

228
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:50,779

The details don't matter.

Suffice it to say,
I was wronged.

230
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,286
All right.
So one summer evening,

231
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,789
I was out having a few drinks,
one or two, maybe three. Ha.

232
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,086
You get the picture.
And who do I see? Chet.

233
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:09,674
He drove up and he double-parked
outside a Dairy Queen

234
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,552
and went in to get some soft serve.
Now, Chet drove...

I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

Which way is he facing?

375
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:59,995
JFK is facing left.

376
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:02,998
Exactly.

377
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:06,585
Which way is he supposed
to be facing?

378
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:09,671
Right. He's supposed
to be facing right.

379
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:13,300
Okay.
So why is this one facing left?

380
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:17,888
Heh. November 22nd, 1963.

381
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:20,224
Kennedy is assassinated, right?

382
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,392
The whole nation
goes into mourning.

383
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:25,020
They start naming everything
in sight after him.

384
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:26,980
The mint wants in on the act.

385
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,109
So in '64, they decide to change
the Lincoln half-dollar

386
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,944
into the Kennedy half-dollar.

387
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,279
When they design it,

388
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,822
they put Kennedy facing right,
facing east.

389
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:38,784
Just the way they had Lincoln.
You know why?

390
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,619
East symbolizes the dawn.

391
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,413
That's why pretty much every
grave everywhere faces east.

392
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,374
So the spirit of the dead person
faces the rising sun.

393
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,543
So that thing.
It's a burial thing.

394
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:51,130
But there's one technician
in the Denver mint, right?

395
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,549
This guy, he believed
in the New Frontier,

Camelot, the whole deal.

397
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,595
So the assassination,
it just destroyed him.

398
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:01,056
When he sees that coin
with Kennedy facing east,

399
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:04,226
facing the American past,
it pissed him off.

400
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:06,145
And so he went rogue.

401
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,897
Without telling anybody,
he flipped things around

402
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:11,984
so that Kennedy was facing west
towards the New Frontier,

403
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:13,319
the future.

404
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,487
Now, the mint struck
about 3000 of these

405
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:18,198
before they figured it out.
They canned the guy.

406
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:21,368
About 1000 of them made it out
into general circulation.

back, melt them down.
