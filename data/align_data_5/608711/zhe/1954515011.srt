那就是你消失的原因?
So that's where you disappeared to?

14
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,749
空姐们有点小麻烦 鸡毛蒜皮的小事而已
Well,there's something about trolley dollies.It must be all that makeup.

00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,349
听着 我才不在乎他认识什么大臣
Look I don't care if he does know the Chancellor...

23
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,949
900万的价钱 没的商量 等一下 什么事?

24
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,749

Well,I called this morning to confirm.

27
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,669
我想 只是出了个小纰漏
I'm sure it was just an oversight.

28
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,949
我们的前台小姐是新手
Our reservations clerk is new.

29
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,679
甚至有时候会忘了让客人刷卡
So new in fact,she forgot to swipe your credit card.

30
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,159
你是...?

去做你那无聊的股票生意

45
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,709
5天内 能还给我50万 是不是?

46
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,789
绝对没错 不过我们得快点
Guaranteed.But we'll have to be quick.

47
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,389
Crown Offshore一旦察觉到 我们控制了他们的股票
Crown Offshore find out that we've manipulated their stock...

48
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,389
我们就玩完了

52
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,719
当你的竞争者发现 你在这上面赚了多少钱
Your competitors will be sick when they find out...

53
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,229
他们一定会被气死的
how much money you've made on the deal.

54
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,959
所以你打算让我加入?
And you're willing to let me in?

55
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,869
第一想到的就是你
First name on my list.

56
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,519
一次就拿回50万?
Half a mil,one hit.

57
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:33,429
- 没问题了? - 还有一个问题
- No questions asked. - I've got a question.

58
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,669
说吧
Shoot.

59
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,199
我的额头上写着"提款机"三个字吗?
Where on my forehead does it say cash dispenser?

60
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,149
- 这次我就不参与了 - 是吗?
- I'm not with you. - Really?

61
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:46,199
既然你还不知道出了什么问题 那么 让我来说清楚吧
Let me spell it out for you,as you're clearly not the sharpest tool in the box.

62
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,189
你告诉我有这么一件事
You tell me about this great deal you have.

63
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,349
有内应 获得无风险的利润等等
Guy on the inside,guaranteed returns,blah,blah,blah.

64
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,229
我给你1000块 你还我4000块 那时你也参与了
I give you a grand,you give me four back.You with me so far?

65
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,349
我会觉得这是可信的 所以 现在我拿到了3000块利润
I'll take that as a yes.So now I'm three grand up.

66
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,079
还是得谢谢你的
Thank you very much,by the way.

67
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,039
你少了3000块 但是你希望投入之后能有回报
You're three grand down,but you're hoping that's a good investment.

68
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:07,749
为什么?因为给了我3000块 就能够让我相信你 给你更多钱
Why?Because giving me three grand should convince me to give you more.

69
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,639
这个就是"引诱"
Let's call it bait.

70
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,989
你还好吗?你看起来有点沮丧 来点喝的?
You all right?You look a bit peaky.Can I get you a drink or something?

71
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,149
不用?好吧
No?So.

72
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:18,749
然后 我给你一大箱子的钱 当然都是现金
Now I give you a suitcase full of money,cash of course.

73
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,669
毕竟 我可以信任你了 是不是?
After all,I can trust you,can't I?

74
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,709
你曾经帮我赚到过钱
You've already made me money.

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,439
只是这次...
Only this time...

76
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,909
你消失了
you disappear.

77
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,509
简单 完美的计划
Simple.Imaginative.

78
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,999
绝对不会出差错
What could go wrong?

79
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,559
好吧 既然你这么说 交易取消
Okay,that's it.Deal's off.

80
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,509
显然你并不信任我
Clear you don't trust me.

81
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,749
那么我们就到此为止吧
I suggest we call it a day.

82
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,069
可是 我的钱已经带来了
But my money's here.

83
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,149
不用了 我已经找到其他感兴趣的人了
No,I'll find someone who appreciates what I'm offering.

84
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,789
我有兴趣 当然有兴趣 拿吧 拿走我的钱
I appreciate it,really I do.Please.Please take my money.

85
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,989
再来一次你那神奇的赚钱术
Do your magic thing one more time.

86
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,159
好吧 听着 你已经拿到3000块了
Okay,look,you're 3,000 to the good.

87
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,389
我们就当什么都没发生过
Let's just leave things as they are.

88
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,119
不 我不同意
No,let's not.

哦 不!
Oh,no.

91
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,869
这算哪门子的欢迎方式?
What kind of welcome's that?

92
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,709
谁让你们没付清帐单就消失了
The kind you get when you disappear without paying your tab.

93
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,149
还以为 你会很高兴见到我们的
We thought you'd be pleased to see us.

94
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:49,629
会计认为 没结清欠款前 不做你们的生意为妙

96
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,199
所以 你们都被拒之门外了

做些污秽不堪的勾当
Nasty piece of work.

138
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,149
我是真的以为 他上当了
I really thought I had him.

139
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,189
他很急进 总是提前一步 获悉所有对手的资料
He's obsessive,always one step ahead,has files on all his opponents.

140
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:26,349
了解所有的事 不留一丝机会给对手
Checks everything out,nothing left to chance.

141
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,389
上个月 某个竞争公司
A rival company snatched a large parcel of land...

142
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,909
在他的眼皮子底下 弄走了一大块地皮
from under his nose last month.

143
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,469
他用高尔夫球杆砸碎了办公桌
Took a nine iron to his own desk.

144
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,279
看上去 他需要学学如何控制情绪
It's like he needs a course in anger management.

145
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:44,069
更糟糕的是 他们在挖掘土地的时候 竟然发现了古罗马时期的硬币
Made worse when they discovered a cache of old Roman coins during excavation.

146
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,229
显然 价值连城
Worth a fortune,apparently.

147
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,909
那件事 让他成为了笑柄
Made him a laughingstock.

148
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,639
似乎 好人是不会有这种遭遇的
Sounds like it couldn't happen to a nicer bloke.

149
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,709
- 你还需要点什么? - 不用 谢了 Mickey 不过我很好
- Do you need anything? - No.Thanks,Mickey,but I'm fine.

150
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,469
不过 很高兴你们能来看我 我知道 那样做并不容易
I appreciate you coming,though.Know it couldn't have been easy.

151
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,829
Mick 你在里面的时候 也穿成那样吗?
Mick,did you have to dress like that when you were inside?

152
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,669
- 别提了 Danny - 只是开个玩笑
- Drop it,Danny. - It was a joke.

153
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,589
- 这个玩笑糟透了 - 抱歉 Mick 我无意冒犯
- A bad one. - Sorry,Mick,no offense.

154
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,829
不用穿成那样
None taken.

155
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,399
听着 好吧 大家听好
Listen,right,listen up.

156
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,909
我想 我们来搞定Jennings这个家伙
I say we take this Jennings bloke.

157
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,039
- 我们不行 - 为什么不行?
- We can't. - Why not?

158
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,149
- 告诉他 Ash - 好吧 他知道太多了
- Tell him,Ash. - Well,he's clued up.

159
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:27,549
当有人发现他们被骗了 他们就会更小心
When some realize they've been conned,they get obsessed by it.

160
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,039
做很多相关的调查
You know,research the subject.

161
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:32,949
他知道很多 足以迷惑Harry这样的熟手 并且反过来骗得钱财
And if he knows enough to take convincer money off a good grifter like Harry...

162
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,389
正如他所做的
that's what he's done.

163
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,359
也就是说 他不会再次上当
Which means they can't be taken again.

164
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,269
诈骗的首要原则...
First rule of the con...

165
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,079
凡事 都要比人早一步下手
always stay one step ahead of the mark.

166
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,189
等一下
Hang on a minute.

167
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,159
我记得首要原则是 你不能欺骗老实人
I thought the first rule of the con was you can't cheat an honest man.

168
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,989
- 这条也是 - 这也可以吗 Albert?
- It's that,too. - Yeah,can he do that,Albert?

169
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,229
只要他想 他就可以更改首要原则?
Can he just change the first rule when he wants?

170
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:51,549
当他们知道有人在骗他们 你就不能再去骗他们了
You can't con someone who knows when they're being conned.

171
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,709
你的意思是 这个家伙比我们都聪明?
You're saying,this bloke's too clever for us?

172
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,709
不 我的意思是 我们只打有把握的仗
No,I'm saying we play percentages.

173
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,589
如果 目标知道诈骗的规则 我们就没什么可玩了
And if the mark knows the plays,it leaves us nowhere to go.

174
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,269
抱歉
Excuse me.

175
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,189
天 真讨厌!
No,idiot.

176
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,919
嗨 美女
Hello,gorgeous girl.

177
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,349
是的 和病人在一起 谁?
Yes,I'm with a patient.Who?

178
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,429
是的 我们是在旅途中邂逅的
One of the passengers,that's right.

179
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,269
没错 遇到气流 太恐怖了 象是场噩梦
Yeah,it's the turbulence in the air....Sickness,nightmare.

180
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:19,429
好的 我会给你打电话的 一定 再见
All right,yeah,I'll call you,of course.Bye.

181
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,589
听着
Look.

182
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,799
难道你们就没其他的 想对我说的?
What's the one thing you've said to me more than anything else?

183
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,669
除了"闭嘴 Danny"
Apart from ''Shut up,Danny.''

184
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,719
听着 每个人都有缺陷 是吧?人人都有弱点的
Listen,now,everyone has a way in,all right,everyone's got a weakness.

185
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,029
也许他就是这个原则的例外
Maybe he's the exception that proves the rule.

186
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,149
也可能不是 对不?
Maybe he's not,okay?

187
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:38,229
是人就会有缺陷 就会有弱点
A mark is a mark is a mark...

188
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,589
就可以下手
is a mark.

189
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,989
行了 既不需要你用功夫 又不需要什么侦察机
All right,look,there's no point doing all this Kung Fu,Grassyhopper stuff...

190
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,149
Mickey 相信我 你不会想要我去做这个实验吧
Mickey,with me,if you're not going to let me put it to the test.

191
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,799
Danny 诈骗是一门科学
Danny,the long con is a science.

192
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,309
你必须理智 考虑到各种可能性 不能有一丝破绽
It's about reason,covering all the angles,leaving nothing to chance.

193
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,629
是的
Yeah.

194
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,349
可是 这就象是去瓶里拿东西一样轻松
But it's also about having the bottle to go for it.

195
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,269
听着 白痴都可以拿走瓶里的东西
Look any idiot can go for it.

196
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,599
而诈骗专家骗走他们的钱
But a con artist takes the mark's money...

197
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,239
他们并不知道 甚至没发现自己被骗了
and he doesn't even know he's been conned.

198
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:09,229
是的 好吧 我们也会有直觉吧?
Yeah,okay.But isn't it also about gut instinct?

199
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,789
Albert 你怎么称呼它的?诈骗第六感?
What's Albert call it?What do you call it,Albert?Grift sense?

200
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,549
最重要的是 不要冒任何不必要的风险
Most of all it's about not taking unnecessary risks.

201
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
好吧 不问这个 换个人来问
All right.Let's put it out.Let's ask the others.

202
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,919
别问我 我退出
Leave me out of it.

203
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,799
当我不存在 行吗?
Just pretend I'm not here,all right?

204
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,679
多谢 好吧 让Albert来决定
Thanks a lot.Okay.Let's let Albert decide.

205
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,069
好吧 表面上看 毋庸质疑...
Well,on the surface,granted...

206
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,389
企图诈骗Jennings的确不太明智
trying to con Jennings is a bad idea.

207
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,829
但是 也有另一种可能性
But there's another challenge here.

208
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,869
不同风格的诈骗方式
Two styles of grifting.

209
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,869
一种深思熟虑过的 就象Mickey说的 各种因素都得考虑到
One reasoned,well thought out,as Mickey says,covering all the angles.

210
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,429
另一种 更需要直觉...
The other more intuitive...

211
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,799
更危险 需要当事者步步为营
daring,relying on one's ability to think on their feet.

212
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,629
很难说 哪种方法更好
Which is the best?Hard to say.

213
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,949
各自有各自的优点
They each have merits of their own.

214
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,469
瞧 说到关键了
See?I got merits.

215
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,469
当然 真正的实施 需要两种互相配合
Of course,the true con has elements of both.

216
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,869
那就这样做 象Albert说的 那是个挑战
That's it,then,what Albert says.It's a challenge.

217
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,069
什么?
What?

218
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,669
赌一把吧 成功了 就是我赢 没有成功 那么换你来
We take the con.If it works,I win,and if it don't,you do.

219
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,909
- 你不觉得 这样做有点孩子气? - 没有 Mickey 我不觉得 来吧
- You don't think that's a little childish? - No,Mickey.No,I don't.Okay?

220
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,749
50便士
50p?

221
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,269
- 什么? - 50便士 赌我可以搞定他
- What? - 50p says that I can take him.

222
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,949
- 50便士? - 是的 现金
- 50p. - Yeah,cash.

223
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,039
赌我能搞定这个不会上当的家伙
To con the un-connable mark.

224
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:33,749
当然 Mickey 如果你是个软脚虾
Of course,if you're too much of a girly wuss,Mickey...

225
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,749
你没有胆子打这个赌的话 现在就忘了这个赌约
a little bit too frightened to take the bet,we'll just leave it right there.

226
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:44,469
好吧 大明星 就和你赌一次
Okay,superstar.You have got yourself a bet.

227
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,949
所以 不管怎样 我们都得下手了?
So we're actually going to do this?

228
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,949
显然是的 没错
Well,it looks like it.Yeah.

229
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,549
告诉他们 不要调解
Tell them it's non-negotiable.

230
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,679
我要那个家伙接受最高刑罚 管它多少年
I want this loser sent down for whatever the maximum sentence is.

231
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,229
是他想玩游戏 他输了 就得付出代价 就是这样
He played the game,he lost.He pays the bill.End of.

232
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,789
很简单 再想想吧
Very simple,just think.

233
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,719
仔细想想
Think it through.

234
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
听着 Danny 为什么你总想要单枪匹马?
Look,Danny.Why do you always have to go out on a limb,hey?

235
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:30,309
我不知道 只是我的内心这么跟我说 Ash 然后....
I don't know.I just hear myself saying it,Ash,and then...

236
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,869
就这样 不管怎么说 我已经开始了
that's it.Anyway,I'm in it now.

237
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:48,919
需要帮助吗?
Need any help?

238
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,399
不用
Me,no.

239
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:53,279
不 谢了 我都已经准备好了
No,thanks.No,I've got it all sussed.

240
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:58,309
我只是...只是在过一遍所有的细节
I'm just really,you know,going through those fine details.

241
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,799
细节?
Details?

242
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,349
我知道你怎么想
I know what you're thinking.

243
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,429
你知道?
Do you?

244
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,269
你在考虑的最重要的事就是...
You're thinking the most important thing...

245
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,509
怎么才能让他不敢报警 是不是?
is to keep him away from the police,right?

246
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,829
大部分受害者都不会报警
Most marks don't report a con...

247
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,949
因为他们认为他们做的事是违法的
because they think they've done something illegal...

248
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,239
更惨的是 有些人不知道什么时候被骗的
or better still,they don't know they've been conned in the first place.

249
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,509
是的 没错
Yeah,that's right.

250
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,269
对于Jennings来说 名誉是至关重要的
With Jennings,his reputation is the biggest thing.

251
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,269
他要自己成为最优秀的
He has to be seen as top dog.

252
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,759
厉害!
Brilliant!

253
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,069
厉害啊 真是....哇!
Brilliant.It is....Wow!

254
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,429
你就象我肚子里的蛔虫
That's like you're in my head.

255
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,389
你大概在想一个办法 如果他报警了的话
You're probably thinking of a way to make him look stupid...

256
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,949
他就会象个傻瓜 是不是?
if he did go to the police,right?

257
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,109
没错
Right.

258
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,359
有些事可能会毁了他的名声 有些特别的事....
Something that might ruin his reputation,that sort of thing?

259
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,629
知道嘛 因为他太聪明 太聪明了
You know what?That is really,really clever.

260
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,789
是啊 有时候我也会害怕这点
Yeah,I scare myself sometimes.

261
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,519
好的 我明白了!各位 听着
Okay,I've got it!Right,listen up.

262
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,589
1个小时后集合 别迟到 谢谢
Briefing back here,one hour.Don't be late.Thank you.

263
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,439
2个小时吧
Let's make it two.

264
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,989
听着 我们得做得夸张点...
You see,whatever we do has to be so outrageous...

265
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,669
这样尽管他知道自己被骗了 也不会去报警
that even if he knows he's being conned,he ain't going to go to the police...

266
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,909
因为他会象个傻瓜 好吧 我从Harry那里获得了灵感
because he's going to look a prat.Right,I got the idea from Harry.

267
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,389
记得嘛 他说Jennings这家伙非常易怒...
You remember he said this Jennings bloke was miffed...

268
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,709
因为另一家公司找到了金币
'cause that other company found all them gold coins.

269
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,189
- 是的 所以? - 所以....所以...
- Yeah,and? - And...

270
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,469
我们可以卖给他一块地
we sell him a piece of land...

271
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,909
我们得让他相信 地底下有东西
but we make him believe there's something under it.

272
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,269
比如?
Such as?

273
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,919
我看过这里的博物馆展览品
I read about this museum exhibition--

274
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:44,509
- 你读得明白? - 是的 谢谢 Stacie 我识字
- You read something? - Yes,thank you,Stacie.I can read.

275
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,589
多谢!
Thank you.

276
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,589
事实上 是Irish John告诉我的
Actually,Irish John told me about it.

277
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,509
这个 Jubilee展品
Right.The Jubilee collection.

278
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,989
黄金铸品 可以追溯到铜器时代
Gold artifacts dating back to the Bronze Age,found...

279
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,959
是在把Jubilee线扩张到东部的时候发现的
when they were extending the Jubilee line into the East End.

280
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,229
是的 我听说过这个
Yeah,I heard about that.

281
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,229
至今人们还不清楚 这些展品是打哪儿来的
What they couldn't work out was where all the gold came from.

282
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,309
有假设说 拥有大量该物品的
It suggested that the Bronze Age inhabitants...

283
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,389
是铜器时代的土著居民 位置就是..
of what would eventually become London...

284
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,359
- 现在的伦敦 - 多谢了 我正打算说这段
- had a plentiful supply-- - Thank you,I was just about to say that.

285
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,629
等一下 这些东西为什么 不可能从其他地方来
Hold on.Why couldn't the gold have come from somewhere else?

286
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,519
事实上 更象是Mendips或Wales 不过...
There are more likely sites in the Mendips or Wales,but...

287
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,269
鉴于此后5000年还没有发明出M4炸弹 所以很有可能是就地开采到的
as the M4 wasn't built for the next 5,000 years,chances are it was mined locally.

288
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,949
- 找寻金矿 - 好了 多谢了
- Gold mine scam-- - Hello,thank you.

289
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,309
- 这是我的计划 - 等一下
- This is my con. - Wait a sec.

290
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:29,909
我们打算卖给这家伙一座金矿?在伦敦中部?
We're going to sell this guy a gold mine?In Central London?

291
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,589
为什么不行?
Why not?

292
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:37,029
这大概是我挣得最轻松的50便士了
This is going to be the easiest 50 pence I've ever earned.

293
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,789
好吧 行了 现在先别花你的钱
Okay,yeah,all right.But don't spend your money just yet...

294
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,279
因为接下来的 才是重点
'cause that is the whole point.

295
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,239
最奇怪的是...
The more outrageous it is,the less...

296
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,199
他会亲眼看着金子的出现
he's going to see it coming.

297
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,999
不过 听上去似乎有悖逻辑
Well,there's a twisted logic in there somewhere.

298
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,909
不 他说的没错 我是说...
No,he's got a point.You know,I mean...

299
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,109
谁会笨到在伦敦的中部去买一座
who'd be stupid enough to try and sell a fake gold mine...

300
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,149
假的金矿?
in the middle of London?

301
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,189
就是这样
There you go.

302
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,759
Harry告诉我 Jennings会看Telegraph杂志
Harry told me Jennings reads The Telegraph.

303
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,189
我们就再弄一份给他
So we mock up a copy for him.

304
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,349
现在他肯定知道这次展览 不过 我们再提醒他一次
Now he must know about the collection,but let's remind him.

305
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,069
下一步 找地皮
Phase two,the land itself.

306
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,909
Ash帮我们找了块地皮
Ash has found us a place.

307
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:53,749
1.5万平方英尺 距离这些藏品的发现地不到1英里
15,000 square feet,less than a mile from where the artifacts were found.

308
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,589
长年以来一直都是废品回收站 如今...
Run as an old rag and bone yard for years.Now the old guy--

309
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,799
非常感谢 现在老人准备退休了 他很愿意卖给我们
Thank you very much.The old man is retiring,so he's willing to sell it to us.

310
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:03,389
协议是我们一找到买家就支付费用
The agreement is we pay when we find a buyer.

311
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:07,679
我准备以双倍的价钱卖给Howard
Okay,I say we sell it to Howard for twice what the land's worth.

312
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,509
我们把老人送去Bognor Regis度假
We'll pack the old boy off on holiday to Bognor Regis...

313
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,789
所以他有两周时间 不会出现
so he's going to be out of our hair for two weeks.

314
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,709
怎么样才能让他相信 那里有黄金?
How do we convince the mark about the gold?

315
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,109
我们要做的就是埋个伏笔
All we got to do is plant the seed.

316
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,789
让他考虑去做个土壤测试
Just enough to get him to take a soil test...

317
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,869
再找一个专家来做评估
and then get a gold expert in for evaluation.

318
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,349
当然 专家也会是我们的人
And he,of course,will be one of us.

319
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,109
你怎么认为?
What do you think?

320
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,669
再多挖几个洞 你可以直接滤茶喝了
If it had any more holes,you could strain tea with it.

321
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,349
老实说吧 伙计 你是怕输了这场赌局
Let's be honest,mate,you're just frightened of losing the bet.

322
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,709
好吧 先做什么?
Okay.So what's first?

323
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,789
- Ash 办公室怎么样了? - 再过几天就弄妥了
- Ash,what about the office? - We'll be set up in a couple of days.

324
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,269
好的 这样 剩下的就是 看我怎么把他弄进来
Right.Then that leaves nothing more than for me to reel him in.

325
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,669
- 什么? - 有问题?
- What? - Problem?

326
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,669
当然 Albert才是下套的人
Yes,Albert's the roper.

327
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,869
这个是分工流程 大家各司其职
That's how this works,we all do our own jobs.

328
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,599
Albert下套 Stacie负责财务...
Albert ropes,Stacie's the banker...

329
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,989
Ash负责提供支援 你和我负责重点
Ash is our fixer,and you and I play the inside.

330
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,389
好吧 无意冒犯你 Albert 可是我们不能太教条主义了
I know that,okay,and no offense,Albert,but we can't do this one by the book.

331
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:06,269
如果Jennings知道所有步骤 我们就得弄个新的来
If Jennings knows all the moves,we've got to invent new ones.

332
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,269
没有人下套 没有甜头
No roper steering him to the inside man,no convincer.

333
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,669
我准备直接上手
I'm just going to dive straight in.

334
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,429
"嗖――"
Whoosh.

335
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,229
"嗖――"?
Whoosh?

336
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,749
相信我 他不会知道 他失在哪一步的
Trust me,he won't know what's hit him.

337
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,839
你怎么想的?
What do you think?

338
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,309
等待结果出现是种折磨
It's a disaster waiting to happen.

339
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,159
告诉我 我想错了
Tell me I'm wrong.

340
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,999
我不行
I can't.

341
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,109
我想 我们得留意一下他
I think we should keep an eye on him.

342
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,229
好的
All right.

343
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,799
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

344
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,669
等一下 我和你一起去
Wait,I'll come with you.

345
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,789
你总是不安于轻松的生活 是不是 Danny?
You don't make life easy for yourself,do you,Danny?

346
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:57,029
会成功的 Albert 相信我 会成功的
It'll work,Albert,all right.It will work,just trust me on it.

347
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,389
- 一切皆有可能 - 什么 你觉得我好高骛远?
- Anything is possible. - What,you think I'm out of my depth?

348
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,039
用你的天赋让我们大吃一惊
Use that talent of yours and surprise us all.

349
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,589
记住 第一印象是至关重要的
And remember,your first meeting with a mark is crucial.

350
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,749
走错了这一步...
If you get off on the wrong foot...

351
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,589
- 就全功尽弃了 - 没错
- you're beat from the start. - Right.

352
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,109
在你说话之前 cold read他 (cold reading:一种心理术)
Cold read him,learn everything you can...

353
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,869
获得你所要的信息
before you say a word.

354
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,309
冷什么?
Cold what?

355
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,109
你应该知道cold reading
You do know about cold reading?

356
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,559
哦 cold reading 我当然知道cold reading
Oh,cold reading.I know about cold reading.Yeah.

357
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,519
好吧 要不要再复习下?
Well,how about a little refresher course?

358
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,989
如果有时间 我想....当然行
If we've got time,I mean....Yes,please.

359
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,629
事实上这很容易 跟我来
It's really very simple.Follow me.

360
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,229
你看见什么?
What do you see?

361
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,029
好的
Okay,right.

362
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,919
- 一个家伙 - 再具体点
- A bloke. - More specific.

363
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,429
你要让他相信你们俩志趣相投 就象是你们心灵相通
You've got to convince him that you're like-minded,like two peas in a pod...

364
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,789
你可以成为他的朋友 要做到这个 你得知道他到底是谁
that you could be his friend.Now to do that,you need to know who he is.

365
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,789
做一条变色龙
To become a chameleon.

366
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:03,869
变色龙
Chameleon?

367
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,999
好吧 他的名字...
Okay.His name...

368
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,799
叫mark
is Mark.

369
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,869
好吧 认真点 好的 他....
All right,okay,seriously.Well he's...

370
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,909
- 他离婚了? - 真是不错
- he's divorced? - There you go.

371
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:16,189
但也许他没离婚
Maybe he's not,though.

372
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,999
他在出差 可以在这里找艳遇
He's on a business trip.Could be here on the pull.

373
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,949
- 没用古龙水 - 好吧
- Not enough cologne. - Okay.

374
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,029
还有什么?
What else?

375
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:28,309
离异 周末会在快餐店 探望孩子们
Divorced.He sees his children on the weekends,at fast food restaurants.

376
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:31,469
他得支付抚养费 而这笔费用...
He has to pay a fortune for the maintenance and that's left him...

377
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,229
让他精疲力竭
tired and stressed.

378
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,269
他可能从不在家吃饭
He probably didn't cook before he left home.

379
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,309
因此 最近他体重下降了
Consequently he's lost weight recently.

380
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,959
不行 我做不到
No way.I'm not having that.

381
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,629
看他的袜子 瞧见没 ――有孩子
Look at his socks.See?Children.

382
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,909
还有指甲 ――压力很大
And his nails.See the stress?

383
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,029
他的皮肤...
His skin.

384
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,349
那是快餐 对吧?
That's the fast food,yeah?

385
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:50,749
这些我都知道了 不过你怎么知道他减肥了?
Okay,I'm having all of this,but how you telling me he's lost weight?

386
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,669
看看他的皮带
Look at his belt.

387
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,119
看这线 都有束痕了
See the line.He's pulled it in a notch.

388
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,549
Mark 你好吗?
Mark,how are you?

389
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,349
你最近是不是减肥了?孩子们怎么样?
Have you lost weight recently?How are your lovely children?

390
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:15,909
多谢
Thanks.

391
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,559
她还是很喜欢你
She's still got the hots for you.

392
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,079
是吗?
Is that so?

393
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,719
怎么 装作不知道?
What,like you didn't know?

394
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,839
这是我呆过的最棒的团队 我想就这样 永远不改变
This is the best crew I've ever had,and I intend to keep it that way.

395
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,429
你Stacie在一起 就会把它搞砸?
And you think hooking up with Stacie would spoil that?

396
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,109
我知道 我和她在一起会搞砸
I know hooking up with Stacie would spoil that.

397
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,519
也许你该告诉她
Maybe you'd better tell her.

398
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,349
伙计们 凡事都要先下手为强
Guys,it's all about staying one step ahead of the competition.

399
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,189
- 你想要什么 你就... - 去争取它
- You see what you want and you just... - Go for it.

400
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,349
不是"争取" Nick 是"得到"
It's not ''go for it,'' Nick.It's ''get it.''

401
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,319
我就是这个意思
Yes,I mean,that's what I meant.

402
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,429
Islington的那个案子
That site I had in Islington.

403
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,749
有个83岁的老人不肯签约
83-year-old tenant blocking the deal.

404
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,559
她不想搬走 她担心她的小猫
She wouldn't move because she was worried her little cat...

405
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:43,829
会找不到回家的路
wouldn't find its way home.

406
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,669
你一定大伤脑筋
That's wrinklies for you.

407
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,959
所以 我开车轧死了那只猫 她两星期内就搬走了
So I ran over the cat,she signed within a fortnight.

408
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,839
你要的东西 一定要紧紧攥在手心里
See what you want,grab it by the balls.

409
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,909
去你的吧
Off you go.

410
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,669
来杯香槟 伙计
Glass of shampoo,squire.

411
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,229
哦 天哪!真够养眼的 不是吗?
Oh,God,scenery's nice,isn't it?

412
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,079
没人打算去碰碰运气?
Anyone tried to pull yet?

413
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,119
Nick打算去试试 不过他忍住了
Nick was just about to try his luck,but he bottled it.

414
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,389
我说了 她可能在等人
I told you,she's probably waiting for someone.

415
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,469
好吧 有一种办法可以知道
Well,there is only one way to find out.

416
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,309
50英镑 赌我能钓到她
50 quid says that I pull it.

That would make me a queen,and a time traveler,at that.

562
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:25,309
事实上 我负责研究该时期的出土文物
No,I'm actually in charge of the artifacts that hail from the period.

563
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,119
这些是我最引以为傲的
And these are my crowning glory.

564
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,999
伦敦最为神秘的文物之一
One of the great mysteries of London.

565
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:37,559
也许会有些荒诞 据说伦敦某个地方有金矿
It seems a bit far-fetched,that there's a gold mine in London somewhere.

566
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:40,719
不 并不奇怪
No,not really.

567
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:44,269
毕竟 六千年以前 地表构造和现在完全不同
The landscape was very different 6,000 years ago,after all.

568
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,589
不过 也存在可能性
No,it's perfectly feasible.

569
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:50,429
而且 我们博物馆有个地质学专家
In actual fact,we have a professor of geology here in the museum...

570
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,029
他正在撰写相关的论文
who's writing a paper on it.

571
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,189
是吗?我怎么才能找到他?
Really?Where do I find this professor?

572
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,509
我是个慈善家 专门投资科学研究
I'm a philanthropist,I invest in scientific studies.

573
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,149
是嘛 我想他会很高兴见到你的
In that case,I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you.

574
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,909
我把他的号码写给你
Let me write down his number.

575
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,399
据说 这个原始的矿藏将价值上百万
It says here the original mine would be worth millions.

576
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,949
没错
Indeed.

577
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,269
我估计 这里所展示的 只是实际的1%吧
I doubt what you see here represents even 1% of what was actually there.

578
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,709
当然 出产地也许已经建了高楼大厦...
Of course,the site has almost certainly been built on by now,so...

579
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,709
谁知道呢 是不是?
we'll never know,will we?

580
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:28,909
我在另一面写了我的号码
I've written my number on the other side.

581
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,309
好好欣赏 玩得愉快
Enjoy the rest of your visit.

582
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,349
Saxon village的复制品也很经典
The Saxon village reconstruction is excellent.

583
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:52,839
你觉得Danny搞不定这事 是不是?
You don't think Danny's going to pull this off,do you?

584
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,149
是的
No.

585
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,989
可是 你还是让他尝试了?
But you're letting him try anyway?

586
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,829
他觉得我们做的事都很容易 让他受点挫折没坏处
He thinks what we do is easy.Won't hurt to bring him down a peg or two.

587
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,079
顺便赌赢这场比赛?
And win the bet in the process?

588
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,589
为胜利者干杯!
To the victor the spoils.

589
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,669
喂?
Hello?

590
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,949
根据我的笔记 Howard....可以叫你Howard吗?
According to my notes,Howard....May I call you Howard?

591
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,029
当然
Yes.

592
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,599
普遍观点认为 大部分金矿的形成...
It's widely believed that most gold deposits,particularly...

593
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,669
尤其是火山岩和沉积岩的那种矿山...
of the volcanic and sedimentary variety...

594
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,319
是由于岩浆带动地下水
were formed from circulating ground waters...

595
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,279
循环而形成的
driven up by magma.

596
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,909
不过 当然 也可能是 岩浆冷却后形成的
But,of course,it could also be expelled from the magma itself as it cooled.

597
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:38,149
- 所以 伦敦也可能出现这种情况? - 哦 是的
- And this could happen in London,right? - Oh,yes.

598
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,229
没理由怀疑 尽管专业得来讲...
No reason not,although geologically speaking...

599
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,119
- 条件并不十分理想 - 但还是有可能的?
- conditions aren't ideal. - But is it possible?

600
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,709
哦 是的 还是有不少残留物质
Oh,yes,there are certain residues...

601
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:51,189
经过了数千年历史的洗涤
that have been around for thousands of years.

602
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,389
如果你认为地里有黄金 你怎么来确定呢?
And how could you find out if you thought you had land with gold in it?

603
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:59,269
很多办法 总之需要做个土壤测试
A multitude of ways,mostly by a simple soil test.

604
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,349
土壤测试?
Soil test?

605
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,309
我可以带些土壤给你
So I could bring you some soil...

606
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,959
你可以告诉我 地底下是否有黄金?
and you could tell from that whether there was gold underground?

607
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,949
不行 我得做很多其他实验
No,I have to have further tests for that.

608
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,869
但是我可以判断出可能性
But I could determine that the possibility was there.

609
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,189
准确率呢?
How accurately?

610
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:16,029
得视地表层的面积而定
It depends on the size of the deposit.

611
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,709
大概百分之八,九十吧
80,90%,possibly.

612
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,509
你有这样一块土地?
You hold such a piece of land?

613
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,589
不 还没有
No,not yet.

614
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,959
不过 如果我有的话 你可以为我做这个测试吗?
But if I did,would you be prepared to do this test for me?

615
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,239
当然可以 如果博物馆不反对的话
Yes,of course.If the Museum has no objection...

616
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,349
我很乐意帮忙
I'd be happy to help.

617
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,949
你说什么?我不需要这个 我不需要
What you talking about?I don't need all this.I don't need all this.

618
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,349
是的
Yes.

619
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:42,669
就这么做 好吧 就这样
Just do it,all right,do it.

620
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:52,669
她很可爱 是不是?伙计 你好 什么事?
Cute,isn't it?All right,mate,how you doing?What's up?

621
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,709
其实 Nick还不知道这件事 他就要离开我们了
Basically,Nick doesn't know it yet,but he's leaving us.

622
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:02,229
所以的他的工作暂时无人接替 也许你对这个职位会有兴趣
So his job's up for grabs.I just thought you might be interested.

623
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,349
年薪5万 加上佣金就翻倍
50K a year,double that with your commission...

624
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:09,109
汽车 住房津贴
nice car,relocation allowance.

625
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,239
真不错 我在听
Lovely.Yeah,I am listening.

626
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:17,589
只是我不知道 你是否适合这个位置
Only trouble is I'm just not sure you're right for it.

627
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:21,639
我也不知道 我是否想为你工作
I'm not sure I want to work for you.

628
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,949
别生气 Paul
Don't take offense,Paul.

629
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:27,519
我想知道 你曾经做过些什么项目?
It's more about what kind of deals you're used to handling.

630
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,909
我是说 和Martin一起 你做过最大的项目是什么?
I mean,with Martin,what's the biggest deal you're doing?

631
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,799
我是不是象个木偶?
Do I look like a Muppet?

632
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:35,549
- 什么? - 你想打听我们的客户
- Pardon? - You're just trying to nick all our clients.

633
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:38,599
好吧 算了
All right,well.

634
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:41,719
只是随便打听下 不用那么认真吧
You can't blame a chap for trying,can you?

635
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:46,469
好吧 就谈谈其中一个项目
Okay,look,just talk me through one of your deals.

636
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,909
我想说...
I mean....

637
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,629
Martin曾经谈到过的 是什么呢?
Martin was talking about one the other day.What was it?

638
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,229
Jubilee的案子?
The Jubilee deal?

639
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,189
- 你知道那个? - 一点点而已 那是什么?
- You know about that? - A little.So what is it?

640
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,839
我只知道....
All I know...

641
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:08,279
我只知道 我们被要求出面购买一块土地
all I know,is that we've been hired to buy a parcel of land...

642
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:11,479
不管出多少价
regardless of price.

643
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,879
- 谁要求的? - 那我不清楚
- By who? - That I don't know.

644
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,989
Martin对这个很保密的
Martin's very secretive about it.

645
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,469
也就是说 就他一个人知道
Which usually means that he wants to take all the credit.

646
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:21,829
你知道是哪块土地吗?
Do you know where the land is?

647
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:43,479
据说拥有者是一个废品回收商
It's owned by an old rag and bone merchant.

648
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,269
我们出两倍的价钱 现金支付的 但是他始终都不同意
We've offered him twice what it's worth in cash,but he ain't having any of it.

649
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,669
用现金?
Cash?

650
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:53,309
是的 他不喜欢银行
Yes,he hates banks.

651
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:54,989
就是个废物
It's a shithole.

652
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,029
我不明白的就是...看那儿
That's what I don't get.I mean,look at it.

653
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,149
不过就是2间房子 不是嘛?
Barely going to get two houses in there,are you?

654
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:02,199
我承认 它离Jubilee线并不太远
I mean,it ain't that far from the Jubilee line,granted.

655
00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:06,269
可我就不明白 老板为什么如此渴望得到它
But,I don't know,the boss seems very keen to pay way over the odds for it.

656
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,349
是啊 你能替我引见下主人吗?
Right,can you get me in to see the owner?

657
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:11,229
我有什么好处呢?
What's in it for me?

658
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,349
我们之前谈的那个职位
The job we discussed earlier.

659
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:14,749
不行
No.

660
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,069
听着
Look.

661
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:21,319
我不知道你想做什么
I don't know what you're up to,all right.

662
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,149
我不知道 我也不在乎
I don't know,I don't care.

663
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,349
可是 你突然告诉我这件事
But,you cut me in and then maybe,you know...

664
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,629
要知道...也许 我会当真的
maybe I'll suddenly start thinking about it.

665
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,949
我喜欢你 Paul 就好象看见了自己
I like you,Paul,you remind me of me.

666
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,789
所以?
So?

667
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,389
没错 成交了 你安排见面时间
Yeah,you've got yourself a deal.Set up a meeting.

668
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,189
我只知道 我们被要求出面购买一块土地
...all I know,is that we've been hired to buy a parcel of land...

669
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,549
不管出多少价
regardless of price.

670
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,829
...不管出多少价
...regardless of price.

671
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,709
- 让你想到了过去 是不是? - 什么?
- Got to you the other day,didn't it? - What?

672
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,309
- 去监狱探望Harry之后 - 是啊 是有点
- Going to see Harry in prison. - Yeah,a little.

673
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,709
不过 你已经惹麻烦了
In which case,you've got a problem.

674
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,709
你知道现在这事情很棘手 不是吗?
You know this is going to go pear shaped,don't you?

675
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:13,709
那孩子太操之过急了
The kid's gone off 100 miles an hour.

676
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:16,229
没有计划 没有诱饵 没有补救措施
Little or no groundwork,no convincer,no Plan B.

677
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,709
行了 要相信他 目前为止他做得很好
Come on,give him credit,he's played it well so far.

678
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,829
得了 Mick 你和我一样心知肚明
Come on,Mick.You know as well as I do.

679
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:23,029
筹备诈骗行动和能否顺利逃脱
There's a huge gulf between setting up a long con...

680
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,679
毕竟还是有很大区别的
and actually walking away clean.

681
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:26,749
我知道
I know.

682
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,749
就是说 你已经有决定了
Which means you've got a decision to make.

683
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:33,389
什么?
Which is?

684
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:36,949
如果他失手了 你会替他收拾烂摊子吗?
If it's going down the pan,do you bail him out?

685
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:41,189
还是让他从失败中吸取教训 顺便赢了这次的赌局?
Or do you let him fail,to teach him a lesson and win the bet?

686
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,149
即使那意味着 你要重新回去坐牢
Even if that means you going back to prison.

687
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:36,029
喂?
Hello.

688
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,229
Howard
Howard.

689
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:41,429
是的 这块地值21万
Yeah,the land's worth 210.

690
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:45,269
我想Martin的最后报价是42万
I think Martin's latest offer was 420.

691
00:46:47,439 --> 00:46:50,559
是的 45万应该没问题
Yeah.450 should do it.

692
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,229
好的 什么时候?
Okay.What time?

693
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,559
好的 很好 我一会到
Yeah,that's fine,I'll be there.

694
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,039
好 一会见
All right,bye.

695
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:02,669
上钩了
We're on.

696
00:47:08,879 --> 00:47:10,109
喂?
Hello?

697
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:13,189
Jennings先生 是的 你好
Mr.Jennings.Yes,hi.

698
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:16,229
十点半 在哪里?
At 10:30.And the address?

699
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,709
好的 我就来 再见
Right.I'll be there.Bye.

700
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,469
喂?Howard?好的 当然
Hello?Howard?Okay,sure.

701
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,999
没问题
No problem.

702
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,909
在哪儿?好的
And the address?Fine.

703
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,389
真奇怪
That's weird.

704
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,439
他为什么要所有的人都到场?
Why does he want everyone there?

705
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,519
我说过 不是嘛?他戒心很重
Well,I told you,didn't I?He's a control freak.

706
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:45,749
好吧 没问题
Okay.No problem.

707
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,669
Ash 去准备下
Ash.Go get set up.

708
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,389
准备好你的50便士吧
Better get your 50p ready.

709
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:10,029
- 准备好了? - 是的
- Right,you set? - Yeah.

710
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:11,839
再过10分钟
Okay,10 minutes.

711
00:48:28,399 --> 00:48:29,719
看起来情况不妙
This doesn't feel good.

712
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,559
那是Danny的事
It's Danny's call.

713
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:49,269
Howard
Howard.

714
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,029
好啊
How are you?

715
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,629
我想最好还是带着保镖 这可是一大笔钱
Thought I'd better bring some security.There's a lot of money in here.

716
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,709
好啊 伙计 欢迎
All right,lads,welcome.

717
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,829
这个是Colin
Here he is,Colin.

718
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:02,229
这就是我跟你提过的Jennings先生
This is the man I was telling you about.Mr.Jennings.

719
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,549
这是Colin Nash
This is Colin Nash.

720
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:05,039
很高兴认识你 Nash先生
I'm pleased to meet you,Mr.Nash.

721
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,549
看上去 你象是准备打一场硬仗
You look like a man who's prepared to drive a hard bargain.

722
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:08,629
是啊
Yeah,rats.

723
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,829
- 是吗? - 我开门见山说
- Really? - I ain't got long.

724
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,399
这家伙很对我胃口
A man after my own heart.

725
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:15,149
他说 你的价比那个家伙要高
He tells me you're willing to beat the other bloke's offer.

726
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:17,069
没错 合同在这里
Indeed,yes,there's a contract here.

727
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:19,669
钱也在这里 都是现金
And the money's in here.In cash.

728
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,309
我明白你不喜欢银行
I understand you don't like banks.

729
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:23,959
是的 就象吸血虫
No,leeches.

730
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:25,309
我也这么认为
I couldn't agree more.

731
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,389
那么 你准备了多少钱?
So how much you got in there,then?

732
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,429
45万
450,000.

733
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,429
到时间了
It's time.

734
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:38,949
小心点
Be careful.

735
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:50,799
我们成交了?
So,do we have a deal?

736
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:52,909
当然 再做一件事就行
Absolutely.Just one condition.

737
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,199
我要做个土壤测试
That I carry out a soil test.

738
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:59,509
土壤测试?
Soil test?

739
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,079
是公司的规定
It's company policy.

740
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,199
非常感谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

741
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:07,999
- 我不知道 为什么我也得来 - 他们是谁?
- I'm not exactly sure why I'm here. - Who are they?

742
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,559
他们是来做测试的
They'll be carrying out the tests.

743
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,199
没有人说要做什么土壤测试
No one said nothing about no soil test.

744
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:14,469
不做测试 交易也取消
No soil test,no deal.

745
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,829
好吧 快点 就象我说的...
Yeah,well hurry up,then,like I said...

746
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:18,239
我没多少时间
I ain't got all day.

747
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,199
我把所有东西都带来了 不用多长时间
I've got everything I need here,it wouldn't take long.

748
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,549
你开始吧
In your own time.

749
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:27,749
我不明白
I don't get it.

750
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,589
你到底想找什么?
What exactly are you looking for?

751
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:31,589
你会知道的
You'll see.

752
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,639
是吗?你确定?
Well?Are you sure?

753
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,309
绝对是微量的黄金
Definite traces of gold.

754
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:55,709
我认为 地底下曾经有过一条地下河
It's my belief there was an underground stream here at some point...

755
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:59,839
是一条支流 并把一些物质带到了地表 瞧见了没?
skirting the main source and bringing the particles up to the surface.See?

756
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:02,109
太棒了
Excellent.

757
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:06,669
- 那么 成交了? - 基本没问题
- So do we have a deal? - It would seem so.

758
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:09,029
再做一件事就可以签约了
Just one more bridge to cross and then we can sign.

759
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,679
什么事?
What bridge?

760
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:11,749
行了
Okay.

761
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,189
Howard 如果你是在开玩笑 我就走了
Howard,if you're messing me about,I'll go.

762
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,949
事实上 Paul...
The thing is,Paul...

763
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,029
那让我感觉是个有预谋的诈骗
it occurred to me this might all be part of some elaborate con.

764
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,109
- 诈骗? - 是的 你可能听过那些骗取信任的把戏
- Con? - Surely you've heard of a confidence trick.

765
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:31,829
比如 你们这些人是一伙的?
For example,say you were all part of the same gang?

766
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:32,949
我怎么会知道?
How would I know?

767
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,109
一个星期前 我一个都没见过
I haven't met any of you until this week.

768
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:37,429
对于我来说 把一整箱的现金
So for me to part with a briefcase full of cash...

769
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:39,669
交给认识不到一个星期的人
to people I've known for less than a week...

770
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:42,029
是不是有点傻?
would be pretty stupid,wouldn't it?

771
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,869
而我 并不傻 所以...
And I'm not.Stupid,that is.

772
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:47,509
我想 最好还是多点保障
So I thought I'd better get some insurance.

773
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,559
你瞧 教授刚刚告诉我 这里可能有黄金
You see,the Professor has just told me there are gold deposits here.

774
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:51,629
黄金?
Gold?

775
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:54,109
没错 你老板对此不是很保密吗?
That's right,yes,your boss was very secretive,wasn't he?

776
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:57,429
尽管你知道土地在哪里 他出多少钱
Although you knew where the land was and how much he'd offered.

777
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,359
所以现在 我要再做个测试
So now I do my own tests.

778
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:02,319
在你们告诉我 地下有黄金的5分钟后
And if they don't find anything...

779
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,429
他们却找不到任何东西
five minutes after you've assured me there was gold...

780
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,549
那么我相信 你们是在诓我
then I'd have to assume you were about to con me.

781
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,309
一个都不准走
No one leave.

782
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,229
如果他们找不到黄金 我觉得他会发狂的
When they don't find gold,I've got a feeling he's going to be very pissed off.

783
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:35,119
如果你能告诉我 你打算从哪条路溜走
So if you tell me which way you're going to run...

784
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,949
我相信 我们溜的时候不至于撞在一起
I can make sure we don't bump into each other.

785
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,549
该死的
Shit.

786
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,989
- 我真希望Danny准备了B计划 - 或是C计划
- I really hope Danny's got a Plan B. - And C.

787
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:50,389
那是什么?
What's all this,then?

788
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:51,629
不会很久的
Won't take long.

789
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:13,229
- 是只害虫 - 你弄完了没?
- Vermin. - Are you quite finished?

790
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,549
得烧了它
Have to burn them.

791
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,999
嗨 这些血是什么回事?
Hey,what the bloody hell's all this?

792
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:22,399
我猜你也该现身了
Do you know I thought you might make an appearance.

793
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:24,549
Paul?
Paul?

794
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,589
这是我的项目
This is my deal.

795
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:29,799
- 你知不知道你在干什么 - 听着
- You have no idea what you're doing. - Look.

796
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:34,239
Jennings先生出价比你高 对方也同意了
Mr.Jennings has topped your offer,it's been accepted.

797
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,309
没你的事了
Get over it.

798
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:36,429
你被解雇了
You're fired.

799
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,549
我想 你只是正巧路过吧?
You just happened to be passing,I take it?

800
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,199
不 我不是路过 Dorothy 告诉我 他在这里
No.I wasn't just passing.Dorothy told me he was here.

801
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:42,269
我们已经成交了
We've done the deal.

802
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:43,709
我是来重新开价的
I'm here to make another offer.

803
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:48,029
Nash先生 我新报一个价 希望你能考虑
Mr.Nash,now,I have another offer that I really think you should consider.

804
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,189
老板
Boss.

805
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:54,989
得了
Okay.

806
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:56,069
我们搞砸了
We're screwed.

807
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,989
我就知道 他会让Albert先做个测试
I take it he got Albert to do a test first.

808
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,189
你怎么会知道?
How did you know that?

809
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:02,269
这是唯一的方法 确信他是不是被骗了
That's the only way he'll know for certain if it's a con.

810
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:03,999
那么我们该怎么做?
So what are we going to do?

811
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,509
Nash先生 我们成交了
Looks like you've got yourself a deal,Mr.Nash.

812
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:28,519
在这签个名
If you could sign there.

813
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:37,519
非常感谢 Nash先生
Thank you very much,Mr.Nash.

814
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:44,509
看上去 你大为恼火啊 Golden Balls
Looks like you've been pipped at the post,Golden Balls.

815
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:47,799
很抱歉 多做了些事 没办法 就怕错信了人
Sorry about all that other stuff,but you never know who to trust.

816
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:50,789
Paul 关于那个工作 我还是决定留着Nick
Paul,about the job.I've decided to keep Nick on after all.

817
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,869
抱歉
Sorry.

818
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,229
有没有人告诉我 到底怎么回事?
Can someone explain to me what just happened?

819
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:03,549
- 他找到了黄金 - 怎么可能?
- He found gold. - How?

820
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:06,549
我猜 Jubilee遗址就在这附近
Well I guess the Jubilee site had to be somewhere.

821
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,029
那就是说 这块地价值上百万
But that means this place could be worth millions...

822
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,429
我们用45万就把它卖了?
and we just flogged it to him for a poxy 450K.

823
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,189
有得必有失嘛
You win some,you lose some.

824
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,399
真够惊险的
That was intense.

825
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,829
快点离开这里
Let's get out of here.

826
00:55:23,479 --> 00:55:24,959
我还是没明白
I just still don't get it.

827
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,069
本该是件非常糟糕的事 不过...
It would have been a terrible,terrible thing.But....

828
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:34,229
真是奇妙啊
Strangely....

829
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,909
我美妙的生活 差点毁于一旦
My sex life would have been a terrible thing.

830
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:40,389
我还真是不太习惯
Do you know I could get used to this.

831
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:42,589
一个安静的Danny
A quiet Danny.

832
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,549
沉默是金
Silence is golden.

833
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,159
笑得很开心嘛
Having a good laugh,are you?

834
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:53,269
大家都笑那么开心
Everybody having a good laugh?

835
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,669
好吧 我的50便士呢?我还要一封信
Okay,where's my 50p?And I want a letter.

836
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:59,319
- 一封信? - 是的 要你亲笔签名
- A letter? - Yes,I want a letter signed by you...

837
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:04,029
为低估我的能力 和不公平的待遇而道歉
apologizing for underestimating me and stating uncategorically...

838
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,469
我是个更棒的诈骗专家 你们都亲眼见到了
that I'm the better grifter.You lot can witness it.

839
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,199
Eddie 拿些纸来 谢谢
Eddie,paper on the bar,squire.Thank you.

840
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:11,839
我希望能这么做 Danny 如果你真的赢了的话
I'd happily do that,Danny.If you'd won the bet.

841
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:14,559
- 我们是不是卖出土地了? - 是的
- Did we sell the land or not? - Yes.

842
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,589
- 好的 钱有没有拿到手? - 是的

843
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:17,669
好的 那么付钱吧
Yeah,then pay up.

844
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:19,869
不 我们赌的是 那种诈骗方法最好
No,but the bet was which is the best style...

845
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,029
是你那种无组织 无纪律 走一步算一步
your unstructured,undisciplined,fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants...

846
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,469
差点害大家都坐牢的诈骗方法呢
let's-all-go-to-jail madness masquerading as a long con...

847
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,029
还是我这种专业的 有计划的 各方面都考虑到 不会被逮到的诈骗方法
or my professional,reasoned,covering- all-the-angles,never-get-caught style.

848
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,109
废话
Bollocks.

849
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:36,909
- 那就是你的理由吗? - 不是 我的理由是 我们成功了
- And that's your argument,is it? - No,my argument is the con worked...

850
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:39,389
- 所以你得认输付钱 - 可是这个计划差点失败了
- and you should pay up. - But the con was falling apart.

851
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,359
我们还是拿到钱了
We still got paid.

852
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,629
那是因为 我帮了你一把
But only because I was watching your back.

853
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:45,519
- 什么? - 告诉他 Ash
- What? - Tell him Ash.

854
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,509
不 别叫我做这个
No,you leave me out of this.

855
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,559
你没有考虑到各个方面 所以我替你考虑了
You hadn't covered all the angles,so I had to do it for you.

856
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:52,829
你怎么做的?我都没听你提过
How did you do that?I didn't hear you say a word.

857
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:54,149
我不需要说什么
I didn't have to.

858
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,509
- 还记得Ash开的那一枪吗? - 是啊
- You remember Ash firing his gun? - Yeah.

859
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,349
他并没有打中什么
He didn't actually shoot anything.

860
00:56:58,439 --> 00:57:02,069
- 哦 难道那只老鼠死于心脏病? - 事实上...
- All right,so the rat died of a heart attack. - Actually...

861
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:03,829
那是我事先准备好的
it was one I prepared earlier.

862
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:07,469
- 什么意思? - 他只是对着地上开枪
- What do you mean? - He simply fired into the ground.

863
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:09,149
为什么?
Why?

864
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,119
因为他在子弹里加了些黄金
Because he'd filled the cartridges with gold.

865
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,909
他的目标就是看中 他们取土壤样品的地方
All he had to do was aim at the spot where the sample was about to be taken...

866
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,389
然后开火 把黄金射入土壤里
and fire,peppering the soil with gold.

867
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,869
- 所以 地里没有黄金? - 当然没有
- So there weren't any gold? - No.

868
00:57:22,959 --> 00:57:24,229
只有我们放进去的那些
Only what we put there.

869
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,029
哦 不 是为了替你收拾烂摊子而放的
Sorry,only what I put there to cover your ass.

870
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:31,559
经验加科学 Danny
Experience,science,Danny.

871
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:32,829
考虑到所有的方面
Covering all the angles.

872
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:35,589
而不是随心所欲
Not going off half-cocked.

873
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:37,159
所以 我赢了
So I win the bet.

874
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,749
是的 好吧....
Yeah,well....

875
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,349
不过...
Whatever.

876
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:46,149
算是打平了 怎么样?
Call it a draw,all right?

877
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,829
不 等一下....
No,now wait a minute...

878
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:50,879
如果我撒手不管 事情就麻烦了
if I hadn't bailed you out,the whole thing would have gone pear shaped.

879
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,629
如果不是我 我们一开始就不会做了
If it weren't for me,we wouldn't have been there in the first place.

880
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,029
- 你欠我50便士 付钱吧 - 不 该你付
- You owe me 50p.Pay up. - No,no you pay up.

881
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,309
- 可是我赢了 - 没有 你没赢
- But I won. - No,you didn't win.

882
00:57:58,399 --> 00:58:00,549
你没赢 因为我 我们赢了一箱子钱
You didn't win.We made a case full of money because of me.

883
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:01,789
是我 因为我才赢了钱
No,because of me,you mean.

884
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:04,149
- 那个网站怎么说? - 我正打算做
- What about the web site? - I was going to do that.

885
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:07,039
我让Albert给你上一堂cold reading课呢?
I arranged for Albert to give you a lesson in cold reading.

886
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,149
什么 cold reading课?我早就知道那些了
What,cold reading?I knew that stuff already.

887
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,639
不 你并不知道
No,you did not.

888
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,469
看上去得吵一晚上了
Looks like it's going to be a long night.

889
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,439
没错 就让他们吵去吧
Yes,shall we leave them to it?

890
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:17,429
为什么就不承认 我光明正大了赢了你?
Why don't you just admit it,I beat you fair and square?

891
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:19,109
那你又为什么不肯承认呢?
Why don't you just admit it,all right?

892
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,839
我赢了那箱钱 你就得离开了
You were going to walk away,I made us a case full of money.

893
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,109
- 我讨厌不服输的人 - 是嘛?是嘛?
- I do hate sore losers. - Do you?

894
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,069
再赌一次
Double or quits.

895
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:29,079
- 什么? - 我想到一个好办法
- What? - I've got this great idea.

896
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:32,199
- 哦 不 - 不 听我说 鸽子

897
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:34,759
- 鸽子? - 是的 赛鸽
- Pigeons? - Pigeons,yeah.

898
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,559
塞鸽 我看到过这个 值很多钱
Pigeons.I read all about them.They're worth a fortune.

899
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:39,389
你会画鸽子吗?
Can you paint a pigeon?

900
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:41,629
- 不知道你在说什么 - 是因为你知道 我说对了
- I'm not even listening. - No.'Cause you know I'm right.

901
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,749
