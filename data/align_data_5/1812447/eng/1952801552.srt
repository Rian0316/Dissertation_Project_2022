1
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:06,775
Oh, man, you guys missed
a great party last week.

2
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:09,978
<i>Say hello to your</i>

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,546
new foster family, Ethel.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,847
You're one of five wives?

5
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:15,050
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?

6
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:17,352
Would it be all right if
my son Jonah came to visit?

7
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:18,486
Keep laughing,

8
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:20,188
and I will slit your throat
while you sleep.

9
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:21,456
<i>Shoplifting is out of hand.</i>

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,857
Did Mickey pay for that?

11
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,159
You have to stand up to him.

12
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:26,227
<i>Tried that once</i>
<i>with his father.</i>

13
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:28,029
Now hold it like you want
to do something with it.

14
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,198
Mickey? Again?
What was I supposed to do,

15
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:31,099
shoot him over a cup of soup?

16
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,600
No touching the forbidden fruit

17
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:34,202
until I'm knocked up.

18
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,070
<i>Slept with someone.</i>

19
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:35,870
Not cash.

20
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:36,905
<i>Guess this was like</i>

21
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:37,972
<i>a booty call, huh?</i>

22
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,007
Yes.

23
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,642
<i>Steve got a text from Candace.</i>

24
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,543
Is he dating someone else?

25
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,111
Who the fuck is Candace?

26
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,547
We work together.
That's all.

27
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,249
<i>I'm home.</i>
<i>Little brother!</i>

28
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:49,150
Hey, you.

29
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:51,019
Mmm.

30

Okay, but you

Okay, I promise...
I won't tell Fiona.

51
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,405
Now, whose house is this?

52
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm not sure.

53
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:21,843
What the hell are we doing here?

54
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:24,212
Trying to find out
if Steve's cheating.

55
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,547
What?

56
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:28,383
Tell me that's not a woman's
car parked out front.

57
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,153
Fiona's a big girl.

58
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:36,691
Fiona takes care of everyone,
but no one takes care of Fiona.

59
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,026
Is this about Candace?

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,695
Because Fiona knows
about Candace.

61
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,430
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.

62
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:44,132
So we have to.

63
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,568
You're a sweet kid, Debs.

64
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:11,693
Did you purposefully
order a "Sex on the Beach"

65
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,828
just so I'd say it
to the gay bartender?

66
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,064
Maybe. Maybe I was
hoping you'd actually

67
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:19,000
take me away someplace so
we could have sex on a beach.

68
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,269
I could barely get you
overnight in a local hotel.

69
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,171
Well, that was then;
this is now.

70
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:26,241
I just feel like I haven't
seen a lot of you lately.

71
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:29,510
You-you mean that you'd
like to see more of me?

72
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,514
Yes, I guess
that's what I'm saying.

73
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,921
Usually by this time
in a relationship,

74
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,290
the guy starts just showing up
for late-night booty calls

75
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,858
or wants me to meet his mother.

76
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:45,927
Either way, I start looking
for reasons to walk.

77
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,696
Well, my mom is in Michigan,
so you don't have to worry.

78
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:52,767
I think that's the first time
you've ever mentioned your family.

79
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,769
Really?

80
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,137
Not much to say.

81
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:59,741
I mean... they
live in Michigan.

82
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,709
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.

83
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,177
Dad used to work for GM,

84
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,914
so I try to send back
what I can to help.

85
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:09,584
Family business...
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.

86
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,486
Come on, let's dance.

87
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,691
Come on.

88
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:23,564
Liam is officially asleep.

89
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,433
That was fast.
Yeah, well,

90
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,468
three pages
from Deb's <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>

91
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:28,836
and he's out.

92
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,772
And if James Franco
wasn't in the movie,

93
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,073
I would've nodded off, too.

94
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,444
Have you got any cash
you can float me?

95
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,947
Florence & the Machine are playing
down at the Chicago Theater.

96
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,215
I really want to take
Karen for her birthday.

97
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,483
Pricey gift.

98
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,152
You think it's getting serious?

99
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:47,221
Fuck off. She's my best friend.

100
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:50,625
Okay? You know I'd never spend that
kind of cash on a girl, anyway.

101
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,759
All right, well,

102
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,062
I got a Hamilton,
and it's yours.

103
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:55,697
Thanks, man.

104
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,801
One, two, three.

105
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,372
God bless Jonah,
my sweet baby boy.

106
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,240
And God bless my husband Clyde.

107
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,875
May those who are caring for him

108
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,877
remind him to take
his blood pressure supplement

109
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,680
and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin
supplement...

110
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,783
so that he can bend down
to pick up our child.

111
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:17,051
And God bless the other wives,

112
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,753
who are probably on
their knees right now

113
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,055
asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?

114
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,590
That's got to suck.

115
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,793
Hopefully, the visit with him
tomorrow will cheer her up.

116
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,628
I'm kind of excited about it.

117
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:29,197
Having a full house... two kids.

118
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,498
Don't get too excited.

119
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:33,368
It's only temporary.

120
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,770
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,572
Mm-hmm. Are you gonna
put those in my ass?

122
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,841
'Cause I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.

123
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,476
And they're for her.

124
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,746
Oh, good, 'cause
that would've sucked,

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,748
trying to fish those out.

126
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:05,767
Hey... hey...

127
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,635
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.

128
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:17,345
Who the fuck are you?

129
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm Frank.

130
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,519
Did we...?

131
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,725
Aw, now... now...

132
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,262
Chins up.

133
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,311
Fuck off.

134
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:52,013
How'd you know it was me?

135
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,182
I was talking

136
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,384
to my Promisemakers
group, and...

137
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,686
I want you to know
that I understand

138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,723
that so much of your bad
behavior is my responsibility.

139
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,126
If you leave a dog
in the house alone

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,262
for more than eight hours,
you can't get mad at him

141
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,898
for peeing the rug, right?

142
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:15,203
I found this...
in an album in the basement.

143
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,907
I don't know...

144
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,976
maybe we can try to...

145
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,778
capture more moments

146
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,913
like these together.

147
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,562
Why is it that I feel like you can't
get away from me fast enough?

148
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,499
Because you're paranoid!

149
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,069
Hey, whatever happened
to that computer class

150
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:50,204
you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.

151
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,272
Not enough people, I guess.

152
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,740
Liam's gonna be up in a second.

153
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,276
I got to get him fed and dressed
and to the clinic

154
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,277
for some shots.

155
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:59,547
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.

156
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:00,581
Hey, Debs.

157
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,183
Steve.

158
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:05,019
Liam up yet?

159
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,420
Squawkin' a little.

160
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,690
So, everything cool with, uh,
with you and Steve?

161
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,325
What? Why?

162
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,361
No reason... I'm
just checking in.

163
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:27,074
Hi, baby bottoms!

164
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,076
Did you have sweet dreams?

165
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,579
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.

166
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,481
I said you <i>have</i> a baby bottom.

167
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,617
Mm, I swore I would never
date a guy whose ass was

168
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:38,686
smaller than mine, but
I seem to be breaking

169
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,954
a lot of my own rules lately,

170
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,322
don't I?

171
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,991
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.

172
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:48,329
Hey, you want to come by
tonight after Liam's down?

173
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:49,330
V gave me a copy

174
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:50,698
of <i>Queen of Outer Space.</i>

175
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,400
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.

176
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:55,303
We could watch it...
and not watch it. I don't think

177
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,939
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work. Okay.

178
00:08:57,973 --> 00:08:59,941
Mm... ah.

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,010
Hey, Steve!

180
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,482
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.

181
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,188
Breakfast! Hey, Steve, can I
get a ride to the library?

182
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:15,423
Motorcycle;
no can do.

183
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:18,559
When did you get motorcycle?
Always had one.

184
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,862
I guess there's a lot I don't
know about you. Truth?

185
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:24,699
I'm in the CIA, and
this is all just a cover.

186
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,807
Any calls, Kate?

187
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,243
Yeah, actually, some
A-hole was looking for you.

188
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,278
Left this number.

189
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,180
Hand me the phone, will ya?

190
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:42,883
Your tab is bigger than my ass, and
you smell like kimchi and vomit.

191
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,485
Now, stop that.

192
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,487
Your ass looks great.

193
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:48,956
Like you in the sack,
make it quick.

194
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,193
I wasn't quick, I was just
busy that day.

195
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:57,031
Hello.

196
00:09:57,065 --> 00:10:00,101
Yes. I have
Frank Gallagher calling.

197
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,603
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.

198
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,605
Who-who... who the fuck is this?

199
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,607
Your settlement is in.

200
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,109
Yeah! Which one?

201
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:10,311
Come see me,
I'll give you the 411.

202
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,949
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!

203
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:23,257
Kev? Veronica?

204
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,459
Didn't you just
clean that yesterday?

205
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:28,929
Child Protective Services is
bring my baby Jonah for a visit.

206
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:32,066
Everything has to be just so.

207
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,402
You're so lucky
you have a baby.

208
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:36,904
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.

209
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:40,908
Two more years, and you'll
be old enough to start trying.

210
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,045
Does it hurt?

211
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,480
Sexual relations or childbirth?

212
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,715
Both.

213
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,383
Yes.

214
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:50,751
Oh, fuck!

215
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:52,253
He's such a douche bag.

216
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,256
He's on this whole father-
daughter Purity Ball kick.

217
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,194
He wants me to
take a vow of celibacy

218
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,730
so we can rekindle our
father-daughter relationship.

219
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,999
Maybe we could not...
talk about your father right now.

220
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,134
Not what you had
in mind for dirty talk.

221
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,903
Oh! Not exactly.

222
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,673
Oh, fuck!

223
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,509
Oh, shit!

224
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,312
- Oh, shh, Carl's right outside. Shh.  
- Oh, fuck!

225
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,714
Oh, fuck!

226
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:20,715
Oh, shit!

227
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,419
- Oh, shit!
- Keep going! Oh...!

228
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,761
Yes? Shatterproof, my ass!

229
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:46,540
Want to go to the planetarium
tonight and get high?

230
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:50,177
I can't. I'm busy.

231
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,912
Doing what? Danielle?

232
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:53,914
The less you know, the better.

233
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,651
Are we still on
for Friday night?

234
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,387
Yeah.

235
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:02,089
Can you give me a hint?

236
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:04,792
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.

237
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,600
Aha.

238
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,902
<i>Crucial Confrontations.</i>

239
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,105
Haven't seen you
here in a while.

240
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,774
Been kind of busy, Simon.

241
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,209
I got a signed first
edition of <i>Harry Potter.</i>

242
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,412
Overrated. Made a better
movie than a book.

243
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:27,415
And now with all those
kid actors grown up,

244
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,884
they're scarier looking
than the villains.

245
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,120
Hey, can you help me
on the computers?

246
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:34,655
What do you want to do?

247
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,290
Dig up some dirt.

248
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:37,892
Name.

249
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:39,894
Steve... W-W-Wilson?

250
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,529
Wilton? You kind of need to know

251
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,864
what the name is before
you can look it up.

252
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,000
Try Wilton, in Lake Forest.

253
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:52,173
There are zero in Illinois,

254
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,008
but there are 15
of them nationwide.

255
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,075
Can you do it backwards?

256
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,577
Notliw?
No. I mean,

257
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,346
if I give you an address,
can you work from there?

258
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:05,152
Hey, um, maybe sometime we
could just casually hang out.

259
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,655
Fine. Fine, yes, we can
casually hang out.

260
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,758
1055 North Ave.

261
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,026
It says the property owners

262
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,095
are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.

263
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,431
Hello, Ms. D-lish.

264
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,133
Cool, then we can, uh,
hang out sometime?

265
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,768
We just did.

266
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:33,214
She opened an ING
Direct Savings account.

267
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:35,683
I haven't kept any large bills
in there for months.

268
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:38,152
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know where she is?

269
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,688
No idea. How much you need?
I've got to buy

270
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:43,557
concert tickets. Yikes.
Wish I had it.

271
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,960
Maybe you should take Mrs.
Niedereiter up on her offer.

272
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,967
Well, that should do it,
Mrs. Niedereiter.

273
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:57,104
There are a lot of dark
corners around my house

274
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:59,773
that could use some
attention, Phillip.

275
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,412
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously

276
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:06,714
gonna do it?

277
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:10,484
Well, no, but... I could
smash her birdhouse again.

278
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,521
Hey...

279
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,589
what do you think of Steve?

280
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,592
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.

281
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,930
You about to retreat
and count your wounded?

282
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,198
No.

283
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:28,002
Just... just want to know
if I should trust him.

284
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:31,038
That's like asking if
you should believe in God.

285
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,743
Just be yourself.

286
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:36,844
Okay.

287
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,680
Okay. Here we go.

288
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,152
Hi. Come in.

289
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:49,390
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!

290
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,194
Hi, baby. Hi.

291
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,196
Good afternoon.

292
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,998
I'm Kev.

293
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,234
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife, Veronica.

294
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,835
Hello. Good afternoon.

295
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,737
How you doing?

296
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,906
I'm Andrea Johnson from DCFS,

297
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:08,842
and I'm here to observe
the home visit today.

298
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,911
So if everything go good,

299
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,180
then Baby Jonah
may stay overnight.

300
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,382
Is your voice dressed
up for Halloween?

301
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,184
Excuse me?

302
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,386
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?

303
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:20,788
Come to tell me I don't know

304
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:22,423
how to be a mother.

305
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:24,792
Uh, you got it wrong,
sister girl.

306
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:27,227
I'm here to see how
Ethel mothers, not you.

307
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,730
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.

308
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,865
That girl's only 13 years old,

309
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,201
but she's still got
her parental rights.

310
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:37,438
I need to make sure the child can
handle a child, you feel me?

311
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,139
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I <i>feel</i> you.

312
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,875
Mm.

313
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,977
Oh! Baby Jonah!

314
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,713
Look at you!

315
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,948
You're hung like
a little bear, aren't you?

316
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,985
Hey, Andrea?

317
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,186
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.

318
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,388
You think we could
apply to get Baby Jonah

319
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:56,490
as a foster kid, too?

320
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,759
That's gonna be a crap-load
of paperwork for me,

321
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:02,396
but we do encourage keeping
family members together.

322
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,064
Yay!

323
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:15,142
All right, then, uh, Eddie's
just down in the basement.

324
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,143
He'll be right up.

325
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,144
And, of course,

326
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:18,812
you will all get your shoes back

327
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,247
when you go, so don't worry.

328
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:23,350
It'd be great if mine
came back shined.

329
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,586
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!

330
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,821
That would be great!

331
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,593
Ah, but at last came a knock,

332
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,094
and I thought of the door

333
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,964
with no lock to lock.

334
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:41,001
Robert Frost... I was
a poetry major in college.

335
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,205
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles to Psalms 127,

336
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,942
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.

337
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,477
Okay.

338
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,646
You guys are
all... okay.

339
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,282
Oh, sweetie...

340
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,185
Oh!

341
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,187
Oh, you are ripe!

342
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:02,890
Oh, nothing a little
Puerto Rican bath can't fix.

343
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,958
Oh... honey.

344
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,326
Where were you last night?

345
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:08,696
I had to spend the
night with the kids.

346
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,330
They needed a little
Frankie time.

347
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,966
Oh. You're such
a good dad.

348
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,236
- Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Sorry, folks.

349
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:18,572
Had a little plumbing issue.

350
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,407

00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,947
Lou?

356
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,015
Frankie boy, how's it hanging?

357
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,518
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?

358
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,554
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss
with this thing on.

359
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:09,857
That's a lie. It was the wiping
that was tough.

360
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,292
This from the escalator
thing at the mall?

361
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,795
No, no, no, this is
the train doors

362
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,630
closing on your ankle.
Right.

363
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,432
I haven't been the same since.

364
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:21,935
Yeah. All I need is
your signature and Monica's,

365
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,604
and the money is all yours...

366
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:24,605
with the exception

367
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,974
of a third of it,
that goes to me.

368
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,208
Plus expenses.

369
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:31,311
Sounds fair.

370
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,648
Me... and Monica.

371
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:36,250
Yay.

372
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,751
That was a hell of warm-up.

373
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,253
Unfortunately, those aren't
the originals.

374
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:42,189
You two will have to go down
to the city legal offices

375
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,724
and do it in person.

376
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,593
What? I'm supposed to take
off work to go do this?

377
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,129
Of course not,
because as you know,

378
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,931
those injury's prevented you
from working, remember?

379
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,567
Oh, shit.

380
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,436
Hey, look at that.

381
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:59,506
Client just went into labor.

382
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,642
Is that gonna be a problem,
getting Monica to sign?

383
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,444
No. Why-why would it be
a problem?

384
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,381
If memory serves,
she was a summa cum laude cunt.

385
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:08,582
Yeah, well, she was

386
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,683
a lot of things.

387
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:10,984
You even know where she is?

388
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,953
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.

389
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,555
Uh-huh. I hope so.

390
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,323
She's a joint claimant
on this thing.

391
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,658
No Monica, no money.

392
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,561
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs before you go?

393
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,696
Bag of dog food
in my desk drawer.

394
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,765
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...

395
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,909
Mmm!

396
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:37,411
All right, come on!

397
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,080
Get off of her!

398
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:43,116
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you

399
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,251
from a phone booth.

400
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,086
Just hit me back at whatever
number comes up

401
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,289
on your cell, all right?
It's important.

402
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,464
Hey, thanks
for taking long enough

403
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,433
to let me enjoy
the scent of urine.

404
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,702
Yeah, I didn't even know
that phone booths exist anymore.

405
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,303
What's up? Sounded urgent.

406
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,739
Yeah, um, I was just wondering,

407
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,543
do you think you can loan me
a couple bills?

408
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,879
I can pay for a job.

409
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,280
You got a driver's license,
right?

410
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:14,615
A few of 'em, yeah.

411
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,517
All right, meet me by the L
at 11:00.

412
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:24,858
Are you screwing
my sister's boyfriend?

413
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,426
If you're selling cookies,

414
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,495
that's a hell
of an opening line.

415
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,132
Do come in.

416
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,043
Can I get you something? Milk?

417
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,378
Soda?

418
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,580
A joint?

419
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:47,881
It's medicinal.

420
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,317
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.

421
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:52,386
How do you know Steve?

422
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,389
Who is Steve?

423
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,190
He's my sister's boyfriend.

424
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,292
How nice.

425
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:00,961
So, he's not

426
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:02,362
pushing it into you?

427
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,568
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna
swing by the hospital

428
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:11,972
to see Dad, so you
can relax now, okay?

429
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,573
Oh! Thank you, Jimmy.

430
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,742
You take such good care
of your mama bear.

431
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,511
Mmm! Mmm!

432
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:20,881
Oh! This is, uh...

433
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,149
Debbie.

434
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,350
Debbie Gallagher.

435
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,419
Nice to meet you...

436
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:27,154
Jimmy.

437
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:29,656
Jimmy is my youngest.

438
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:34,428
Top of his class at
Michigan in med school.

439
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:38,665
He is going to be
a cardio-thoracic surgeon

440
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,501
like his big brother
and his daddy.

441
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,670
And he has been taking
such good care of me

442
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:45,939
since his father went
into the hospital.

443
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:50,277
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.

444
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:54,348
And you know, doctors make
the worst patients.

445
00:21:54,382 --> 00:21:57,617
Oh, would you like to stay
for dinner, sweetheart?

446
00:21:57,652 --> 00:22:01,221
Oh shit!
I liked her.

447
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,159
Hello? Hello?

448
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:09,730
Shit. Shit.

449
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:12,366
Shit, shit, shit!

450
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,700
Frank?

451
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,906
Frank, I... I certainly hope
you're not pooping in there.

452
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,442
It's a closet.

453
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,978
Frank?

454
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,817
You didn't poop
in there, did you?

455
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,319
I was waiting

456
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,354
to surprise you.
Oh.

457
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:36,623
Surprise!

458
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:41,995
You got me!

459
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,630
Oh, Frankie.

460
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,965
Hey, do me a favor?

461
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,334
Call this number,

462
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,537
and, and ask if
Monica is there.

463
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:53,640
And if she is, tell her...

464
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,008
Congratulations!

465
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,443
She's won!

466
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:57,944
Who's Monica?

467
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,613
Doesn't matter.

468
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:00,914
What'd she win?

469
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,983
Uh... I don't know.

470
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:06,286
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.

471
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,654
A lottery?
A prize.

472
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,022
A teddy bear.

473
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,491
What for?

474
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:13,660
Jesus, with the
questions already!

475
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,695
Just call, say..

476
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,098
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.

477
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:21,068
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.

478
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:26,973
Well... I hope this Monica,

479
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,110
whoever she is,

480
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:34,214
worked really hard
for that prize.

481
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,485
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!

482
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,823
Sheils... Shit.

483
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,263
Hey.

484
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,532
Hey...

485
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,502
Come on.

486
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:02,476
She didn't really
win a teddy bear.

487
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,744
But you want to know what?

488
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:08,215
If I was giving away
teddy bears,

489
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:11,485
you would be absolutely
top of the list.

490
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,907
If you will do this for me,

491
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:38,578
I will dress up
any way you want,

492
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,580
no safety word.

493
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,850
Is this Monica?

494
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:49,322
Well, hello. This is Sheila,

495
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,491
from Market Promotions.

496
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:55,529
Can I ask you where you do
all of yr grocery shopping?

497
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:59,032
Well, yes, that's right!

498
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,834
You've won!

499
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,436
First prize!
Congratulations!

500
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:06,239
It's $100.

501
00:25:06,274 --> 00:25:08,074
Yes. And, um...

502
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,376
What?
Teddy bear.

503
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,944
Teddy bear.

504
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:12,212
And, and a teddy bear.

505
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,214
And a great big teddy bear.

506
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:17,817
Hello?

507
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,187
Yeah...

508
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,022
She's crying.

509
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,557
Oh, fuck.

510
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:26,393
Oh, yeah, no, I've never
won anything either.

511
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:27,928
Aw...

512
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,362
It's so great.

513
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,531
Yeah. I'm thrilled.

514
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,166
I'm thrilled for you.

515
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,035
Get to the fucking point.

516
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,771
Anyway, prizes will be given out

517
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,339
at 3:00.

518
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,409
At the store.

519
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:43,910
Yes.

520
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:47,948
WGN's own Tom Skilling
will be presenting.

521
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,220
She doesn't
know who Tom Skilling is.

522
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,955
I don't know who fucking Tom...

523
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,323
He does the weather.

524
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:58,391
Tom Skilling, he does
the weather on WGN.

525
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,227
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.

526
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:03,563
Jim Ramsey might be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

527
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:05,498
He does weekend weather.

528
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,733
Okay... okay...

529
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,602
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!

530
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:11,538
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?

531
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,040
How can you not know who two
of Chicago's weathermen are?

532
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,575
What kind of person
is this Monica?

533
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,912
Is she coming to get
the fucking prize or not?

534
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,348
Yeah. She...
oh, she's going.

535
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,782
She's...

536
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,618
she's excited about
that teddy bear.

537
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,132
You know, not sure
I can prove it, but...

538
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,167
I think it's colder
on the North Side.

539
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,205
Let me take you home, Debs.

540
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,074
I'm not supposed to
take rides from strangers.

541
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,277
And it's clear that
you are a stranger.

542
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,146
Oh, man.

543
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,682
Are you gonna tell Fiona?

544
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,784
Exactly what am I
supposed to tell her?

545
00:26:57,818 --> 00:27:00,487
That your name isn't Steve?

546
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:03,223
That you have a family
in Chicago she's never met?

547
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:05,492
Or that your mom
kisses you on the lips?

548
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:07,160
Which is really gross,
by the way.

549
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,963
Life gets really complicated
when you're an adult.

550
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:12,065
I mean, you can't
possibly understand

551
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,433
these things right now.

552
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,604
I understand that you
lied to my sister.

553
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,040
Why?

554
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:22,442
Because I was raised
by a pack of wolves.

555
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,377
Just like you were.

556
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,780
Only my wolves went to Harvard.

557
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,882
You know they have Red Wolves
at Lincoln Park Zoo.

558
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,884
Maybe we could go
check them out sometime.

559
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,485
Trying to distract me

560
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,521
by asking me out on a date?

561
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:36,289
I do not want to be a doctor.

562
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,758
I do not want to be like
the rest of my family.

563
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,760
What I want is Fiona.

564
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:42,529
I love her!

565
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:45,198
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.

566
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,000
What are your intentions?

567
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,635
You're distracting her,

568
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,171
and I need her in the game
for at least a few more years.

569
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,973
I can't have you
breaking her heart,

570
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,608
or running off with her.

571
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,711
So if you're not serious
about sticking around,

572
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,512
back off now.

573
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:02,482
I bought her a house.

574
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,484
Is that serious enough?

575
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,219
You what?

576
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,855
Come on.
I'll show you.

577
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,969
Really?
Yeah.

578
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,637
Yes! Yes!

579
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:26,139
This was
Mr. Harris's house.

580
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,607
They said he died
of lung cancer,

581
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,776
but we're all pretty sure
it was full-blown AIDS.

582
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,782
Oh. My. God.

583
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,417
Has Fiona seen it?

584
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:39,052
No, she doesn't
know about it yet.

585
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,820
I was going to, you know,
fix it up a bit,

586
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,455
and surprise her
when the time is right.

587
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:46,726
Think we could build
an above-ground walkway

588
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:48,228
that connects the two houses?

589
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:49,562
What, like a Habitrail tube?

590
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,531
That would be awesome.

591
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,001
Are you going to tell Fiona?

592
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,673
Don't know yet, Jimmy.

593
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,343
Saw a really cool
pink vest at the mall.

594
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,911
Really?

595
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,747
And I could use a new
rolling pin and flour sifter.

596
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:10,016
Sheila's teaching me
how to bake.

597
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,751
Anything else?

598
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,089
Not for the moment.

599
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,357
So...

600
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,260
which room will be mine
when I sleep over?

601
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,274
Not going out with that
Gallagher degenerate tonight?

602
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,143
Good.

603
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,579
You deserve better.

604
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,881
I've been reading more about
this Purity Ball thing.

605
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,283
It says here you can

606
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:45,151
"re-dedicate yourself
as a virgin."

607
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:47,654
Start over.
Isn't that nice?

608
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:54,828
I mean, you show up,
confess your transgressions,

609
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:57,831
and pledge yourself to be pure
again, in the eyes of the Lord.

610
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,469
I'll give you the damn car.

611
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,005
Really?

612
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:18,485
Fiona would be pissed

613
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,553
if she knew you were
into this shit with me.

614
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,092
Well, what she doesn't
know won't hurt her, right?

615
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:28,094
All right.
Task at hand.

616
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,496
You'll be driving
the follow car.

617
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,898
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.

618
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,300
Nice silver Mercedes.

619
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:36,336
Nice security camera
at the intersection.

620
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,404
Wait, why don't we head up
to some asshole town,

621
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,273
like Lake Forest?
Plenty of douche-mobiles up there. No.

622
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,342
No, I was just thinking that, you know...
Listen, no.

623
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,211
200 bucks to follow me
after I lift the car,

624
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:47,280
you get your concert tickets,
I get my work done.

625
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:49,816
That's it. Okay?
All right, man.

626
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:56,890
Shit.

627
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,892
Rule number two:

628
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:02,462
always remember where
you park the follow car.

629
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:15,909
Fuck.

630
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,894
Monica.

631
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,009
Monica?

632
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,197
Deb.

633
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:14,033
Jimmy.

634
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:16,703
Fiona's next door with Liam.

635
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:19,405
That my "shut-up gift"?

636
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,575
Well, I like to think of it
as a peace offering.

637
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,043
Peace offering

638
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:26,045
implies a one-time thing.

639
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,414
This could take a while.

640
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,882
How long?

641
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,653
Till I'm sure that
you're not still lying.

642
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:37,590
Okay. I gotta get back
up to Lake Forest.

643
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,992
They're releasing my dad
from the hospital.

644
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:41,060
I'm gonna pick him up,
I'm gonna take him home.

645
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:44,263
You know everything there is
to know. No more secrets.

646
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,299
I promise.

647
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:51,404
Sifter sifts, and
rolling pin rolls.

648
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:54,407
Nice when things do
what the say they will.

649
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,017
Jimmy.
Steve.

650
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:06,185
Is this your idea
of a joke, huh?

651
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,856
'Cause you're scared of women
with an opinion, yeah?

652
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,558
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.

653
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:15,561
I'll show you what's funny
when I rip your fucking face

654
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,130
off your fuckin' head!

655
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,299
Out of the way, Monica!

656
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:25,138
- Get out of the way now!
- Put the shovel down. Please!

657
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,174
I'm sorry.

658
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,976
Who lies about a teddy bear?

659
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,278
Wasting my fucking time.

660
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,280
Are you sure this is even
the right store? Yes.

661
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,349
They specifically
said this store?

662
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:37,950
Yes, I told you yes.

663
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:40,286
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.

664
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,156
Stop talking to me
like I'm stupid.

665
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:53,266
Frank?

666
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,203
Frank!
What?!

667
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,772
Frank!

668
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,178
Start the car!

669
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,879
What?

670
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,082
Go, go, go!

671
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,817
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.

672
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,719
What's going on?

673
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:15,621
Come on, we gotta
get outta here! Go!

674
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,932
I'm gonna rip it off
when I catch you!

675
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,369
Can't this piece of shit

676
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,904
go any faster?!
No.

677
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,741
Monica's batting
for the other team.

678
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,709
What?!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!

679
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:38,044
Shit!

680
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,616
Hmph!

681
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,787
♪ You're gonna look over, you
never know what you'll find... ♪

682
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:52,892
Go! Go!
Shut up, Frank!

683
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,161
Go! Go!

684
00:34:56,363 --> 00:35:00,333

685
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:01,467
♪ But we'll stop! ♪

686
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:04,036
Fuck off, lesbos!

687
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,574
I would say my advice
to you would be

688
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:11,410
to let Fiona live in
her own relationship.

689
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,012
You can't do it for her.

690
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,781
There's things you should know.

691
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:18,384
Well, sometimes, sweetie,
when people are in love,

692
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:21,754
they don't tell someone
everything for a reason.

693
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,456
That's like lying.

694
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,928
No, sweetie, it's just...
it's a little editing.

695
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:32,431
Now the sifting. See?

696
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,468
We separate and aerate
those flour particles

697
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:38,204
to make them absorb
liquids better.

698
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,673
Someone should sift my dad.

699
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:44,243
Oh, you Gallaghers.

700
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,478
You're all so funny.

701
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:47,947
Frank!

702
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,048
This is bullshit, Frank!

703
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,683
Bar the door!
Lock the door!

704
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,618
What is happening?!

705
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:53,619
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.

706
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,521
I thought we lost 'em.

707
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:56,789
Did you even have
a plan back there?

708
00:35:56,824 --> 00:36:00,693
I was going to charm her
into signing once she was there.

709
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,829
How the hell was I
supposed to know

710
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:07,200
she would show up with ghetto
Godzilla in a Peterbilt.

711
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,702
I am seriously this close
to punching you in the dick.

712
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:24,217
Get...
They're just girls.

713
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,652
Stop. You talk to them.

714
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,188
I need the key
to the back door.

715
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:30,690
That is not a sexual euphemism.

716
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,659
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?

717
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,829
I-I-I don't know. I can't think when
you yell, Frank. I'm not yelling.

718
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,464
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.

719
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,132
I need the key, Sheila.

720
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:43,102
Okay, okay, it's by the...
it's by the...

721
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,738
it's by the washing machine.
It's not by the washing machine.

722
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,607
Yes, it is. I put it

723
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,475
by the washing machine.
It's not by the...

724
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:51,744
Mom.

725
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:57,383
It-it's Mom.

726
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,527
Debbie.

727
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,129
Oh, my sweet pea.

728
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:28,614
What the fuck

729
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,716
are you looking at?!

730
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,723
Hey, look, I got nothing
to do with it, all right?

731
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,891
I'm just the driver.
Sit.

732
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,259
Sit your ass down.

733
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,298
Oh...

734
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:49,068
That was a nasty trick.

735
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,471
Even for you, Frank.

736
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,907
I had my heart set
on that teddy bear.

737
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,575
Oh, poor Monica.

738
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,977
Well, what about your kids?!

739
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:00,046
Remember?

740
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,647
The six kids?

741
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,416
Youngest was only
two months old

742
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,617
before you ran off.

743
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:07,086
Ended up with...
fucking Shrek here.

744
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,821
You want me to step
in here, Monica?

745
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,657
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.

746
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,593
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose

747
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,928
to leave my family.

748
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,530
You almost destroyed me.

749
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:19,632
When I turned up at
Roberta's that night,

750
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,667
- I was an...
- Emotional cripple!

751
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:22,768
Oh, bullshit.

752
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,603
With not one ounce
of self-respect.

753
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,672
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.

754
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,641
You drove me into
the ground, Frank.

755
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:31,978
You-you robbed me
of any sense of dignity

756
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,612
I ever had,

757
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,147
and...

758
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:38,284
Where's the rest of the kids?

759
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,318
They're out playing.

760
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:41,320
They live down at Fiona's.

761
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,790
You mind putting some bags on?

762
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,928
Can you... can you put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?

763
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,764
- Take your shoes off.
- I need you to put bags on.

764
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:10,349
Don't, don't don't.

765
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:13,019
Hell hath no fury
like popcorn burned.

766
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:15,321
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.

767
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,791
Are you guys going to make
a baby while we watch <i>Cosmos?</i>

768
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,593
'Cause that's going
to make me throw up.

769
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:22,495
Billions and billions of sperm.

770
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:23,729
Ew!

771
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:25,698
Steve, please turn it on
already.

772
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,333
Yeah, hurry up.

773
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,635
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!

774
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:30,903
Cool.

775
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,005
Hey.

776
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,473
And what our faith may be.

777
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:37,710
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.

778
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:42,314
Get a room.

779
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:43,883
- Get your tickets?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

780
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,085
Glad I could help.

781
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,219
Glad you're glad.

782
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,821
Steve.

783
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,723
And birds...

784
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:54,293
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.

785
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:56,362
That doesn't mean I want
you to buy us a new one.

786
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,030
The universe is
smaller than atoms.

787
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:03,569
But it's also the story
of our own planet. Debs?

788
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:04,603
Honey, what happened?

789
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:08,007
What, Dad have
one too many again?

790
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:11,043
You just got to ignore him
when he's like that, Debs.

791
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,913
Why do you always
blame Dad first?

792
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:16,782
Who else is there?

793
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:19,185
She's over at Sheila's.

794
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,920
Who?

795
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,289
Monica.

796
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:27,793
Relationships of the
awesome machinery of nature.

797
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,429
Who the hell is Monica?

798
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,565
Her mother.

799
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,733
On this shore, we've learned...

800
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,369
Debs.

801
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:39,405
What do you care?!

802
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,109
You'll be living with Steve in
that house he bought next door!

803
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:47,279
Some part of our being knows...

804
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,484
Surprise.

805
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:55,554
Because the cosmos
is also within us.

806
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:58,824
We're made of star stuff.

807
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,560
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.

808
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,932
Mommy! Mommy!

809
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,167
I know.

810
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:13,339
Mommy!
Mommy!

811
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:17,610
Worlds of ice
and stars of diamonds.

812
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,111
Atoms and masses...

813
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:32,758
What the fuck?

814
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,260
I need to see you.

815
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:36,295
- Not a good time.
- Who keeps hanging

816
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,397
their fucking laundry
on my pull-up bar?!

817
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:41,100
I-I-I don't know
where else to go.

818
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:44,170
I thought you were
working today.

819
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:47,306
Uh, Linda's gonna have my ass.

820
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,809
I'm supposed to be there now.

821
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,678
I'll meet you there in 20.

822
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,850
Oh, bullshit!

823
00:41:57,884 --> 00:42:00,319
You physically abused me.

824
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,921
What?! When?!

825
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:03,222
The Fourth of July.

826
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:05,524
Oh, come on, you
hit me in the face

827
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,426
with a tray of apple pan dowdy.

828
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,128
And you hit me back.

829
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:12,398
Yeah, after you broke my nose
and scratched my cornea.

830
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:13,499
Oh, yeah? What about this?

831
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:16,001
Oh, come on, you
started that one.

832
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,003
And I'll finish it
if you lay a finger on her.

833
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,371
Roberta...

834
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,606
Bob. Only Moni
called me Roberta.

835
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,277
All right, well Bob,
we're just in the way here

836
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,880
and we should make our exit

837
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:31,250
and leave Monica
for her apologies.

838
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:32,418
Apologies?

839
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:33,552
For walking out

840
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:34,954
on this piece of shit?

841
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:37,990
No, for walking out on them.

842
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,365
Oh, my God.

843
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,467
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.

844
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,902
Just came to rubberneck.

845
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:00,279
<i>Alhamdu lillah!</i>

846
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:02,481
Ian, I did it.

847
00:43:02,515 --> 00:43:04,149
Linda's pregnant.

848
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:06,652
Ian. Finally knocked her up.

849
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:08,120
Where are you?
I did it.

850
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:09,955
It's over.

851
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:20,366
What the fuck?!

852
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:35,447
Sign the name! Sign the name!

853
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:42,454
You're all so big.

854
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,691
I missed you so much.

855
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:49,561
Well, why didn't you
take us with you?

856
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:53,265
Because...

857
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:58,170
I knew you'd be fine
with Fiona.

858
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:28,334
Fucking right you
keep your mouth shut.

859
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:33,906
You better keep it shut.

860
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:37,276
You hear me?

861
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,879
Put the candy back, Mickey.

862
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:47,419
Mm. That's sweet.

863
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:48,987
I like 'em sweet.

864
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:53,492
But then, uh...

865
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,461
so do you, huh?

866
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:56,562
Huh?

867
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:59,131
Put it back.

868
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:00,999
Now.

869
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:05,471
Fuck!

870
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,874
Kash, what are you doing?

871
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:10,809
It's a fucking Snickers bar!

872
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:13,512
Fuck!

873
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,413
Holy shit!

874
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:18,150
Jesus Chr...!

875
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:19,551
You okay?
Fuck!

876
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:24,289
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!

877
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:34,099
Thought you were at work.

878
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:36,268
There was a shooting.

879
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,270
Mickey and Kash.

880
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:40,873
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?

881
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:43,342
Kash shot Mickey.
What?

882
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:45,744
In the leg. He's fine.

883
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,881
I just wanted to get out of
there before the cops got there.

884
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:51,383
What'd I miss with Mom?

885
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,853
Well, you know how Dad's
a total fucking asshole?

886
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:56,088
Yeah.

887
00:45:56,122 --> 00:45:59,291
Turns out he's the good one.

888
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:02,594
Oh, I can't believe you sucked
me back in here for money!

889
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,630
I did no such thing.

890
00:46:04,664 --> 00:46:08,233
But since you're in town, why don't
you sign up for this little thing

891
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:11,003
and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

892
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:12,905
Wait, you brought
her back here?

893
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,573
Oh, Ian.

894
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,443
Wait, you knew where
she was the whole time?

895
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:19,144
Okay, look, this little reunion

896
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,280
was bound to happen
sooner or later anyway.

897
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:24,516
We were thinking about coming around
to talk to you about something else.

898
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,385
No, no... Yes, now. Yes, now.

899
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:29,054
Moni and I want to take
Liam to live with us.

900
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:30,088
What?!

901
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,490
Over my dead body.

902
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:34,126
How about Moni sign whatever
the hell it is you need...

903
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,761
we get Liam.
Done.

904
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,629
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.

905
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:39,998
Why the hell not?

906
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,767
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,

907
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,735
Liam is black.

908
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,738
All you white folks scooping up black
babies like fashion accessories

909
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:48,841
have a rude awakening coming.

910
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,477
There will be a backlash
if people don't stop

911
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:53,412
underestimating the
cultural importance

912
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:55,614
of a black parent

913
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:58,050
raising a black baby.

914
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:00,419
Liam needs me
and he's coming with us.

915
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:02,087
Out of the fucking
question, Roberta.

916
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:04,756
Roberta and I want to
start a family of our own.

917
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,892
Well, how about you
finish this one first.

918
00:47:06,926 --> 00:47:08,060
They're taking Liam?

919
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:09,695
No!
Yes!

920
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,663
No, nobody's taking
anyone anywhere.

921
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:12,798
You don't get

922
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:15,100
to abandon your kids
and then show up one day

923
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:17,603
to take your pick of the litter.

924
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:19,071
Oh, now that's not fair.

925
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:20,272
Your mother's made mistakes,

926
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:22,107
but she's here now.

927
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:25,978
- That's got to count for something.
- Shut up, Frank!

928
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:27,613
This isn't about you.

929
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:29,681
This is about you.

930
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:33,051
This is about what
you didn't do.

931
00:47:33,086 --> 00:47:34,987
It's about what I did.

932
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,822
And you know what?

933
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:39,591
I did a fucking great job.

934
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,827
Debbie is class president.

935
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,663
She's on the debate team,
going to nationals.

936
00:47:44,697 --> 00:47:47,032
And Lip, he's top of his class.

937
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:49,101
He set the curve.

938
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:51,470
Ian was promoted in ROTC

939
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:53,405
and he tested out of English.

940
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:56,909
And Carl made something
blow up for his science fair.

941
00:47:56,943 --> 00:48:00,546
And you know what, they did
it all, no thanks to you!

942
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,114
Because you weren't here!

943
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:03,515
And I appreciate that, Fiona.

944
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,953
But I'm here now.

945
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:09,121
And Liam

946
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:11,590
belongs with me.

947
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:13,091
He doesn't even
know who you are.

948
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:16,128
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!

949
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,134
I don't!
I don't know!

950
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:23,435
Maybe I'll never be able

951
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,204
to make things right with you...

952
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,142
but there's still
time with Liam.

953
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:33,845
And Debbie and Carl,

954
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,349
I am so sorry if I hurt you.

955
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:41,620
See, I love you so much.

956
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:43,689
Please let me be
your mommy again. Please?

957
00:48:58,004 --> 00:48:59,204
You know what?

958
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:03,308
You're right.

959
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:05,510
You are their mother.

960
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:08,513
And you're here now.

961
00:49:08,548 --> 00:49:09,948
So I'm done.

962
00:49:09,983 --> 00:49:13,952
I'm done with the school
and the bills and the clinics.

963
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:16,655
I'm done.

964
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:19,024
They're all yours now, Mom.

965
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:21,326
Good luck.
