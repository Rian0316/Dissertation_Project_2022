00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,054
Thank you.

355
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,598
- Hi.
- Hey, you're...

356
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm sorry.
It took me a while to get going.

357
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,102
It's okay.

358
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,397
There's still
a little light left.

359
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,193
No, no, wait.
I want one of those.

360
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,619
♪ ♪

361
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,162
Yo, Reese.

362
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,664
- Hey, Zoe.
- Hey.

363
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,583
- Just give me one second.
- Thank you.

364
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,295
- [Jordan] Hi.
- Hey.

365
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,090
Do you think that we could
push, like, an hour?

366
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,217
Um, I just overslept,

367
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,511
and I am still waking up,
and I have a couple errands

368
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,221
- I need to run before.
- You know what?

369
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm totally exhausted, too.
I could...

370
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,766
I could really just go home
and crash right now.

371
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,810
Wait, no. I just need an hour.

372
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,187
Okay. I just thought that...

373
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,647
I mean, if I'd known we weren't

374
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,357
having dinner at all,
I would've planned

375
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,525
my whole day differently.

376
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,152
Sure, sure.
Sure, an hour's fine.

377
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,361
Great. So,

378
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,322
I'll see you in a bit, okay?

379
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,410
- Thank you, Reese.
- See you later.

380
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,330
Oh. No, no, no, no.

381
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,041
Hey. Can you just let me in?

382
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,378
You guys, like, closed
six minutes ago. I just...

383
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,880
I just really need
to pick up a prescription.

384
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,381
I'll be in and out.

385
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,759
Come on!

386
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,803
I would open the door for you.

387
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,435
[Jordan] Uh,
can we have bruschetta,

388
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,895
- as well, please? And, uh...
- Sure. Yeah.

389
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,898
And I'll have a glass
of Nebbiolo.

390
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,441
You want any wine?

391
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,234
- What do you think?
- What?

392
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,403
Have a full day of work
ahead of me.

393
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,363
I was just asking.
Sometimes you...

394
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,908
Not today.

395
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,202
And for you?

396
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,872
Would it be possible
to get some scrambled eggs?

397
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,874
Scrambled eggs?

398
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, and bacon.

399
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,919
That's really all I want
right now.

400
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,378
Zoe, uh...

401
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,214
What?

402
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,883
I know they have eggs because
they serve spaghetti carbonara,

403
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,844
and eggs is one of the main
ingredients of carbonara.

404
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,012
And guanciale.

405
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,557
That's kind of
like bacon, right?

406
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,393
Uh, yeah. I mean,
I can certainly check

407
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,686
with the kitchen if they...

408
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,396
[Zoe] I don't know why
you even have to check.

409
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,775
They can just scramble the eggs
that we both know they have

410
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,820
and put it on a plate
with the guanciale,

411
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,866
and it's spaghetti carbonara
minus the spaghetti.

412
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,911
Uh, chef does not generally
allow substitutions.

413
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,832
But is there anything else
you would like if he says no?

414
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,710
You know what?
Forget it. It's fine.

415
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,795
I'll just have a cappuccino.

416
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,713
Sure.

417
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,591
Look, toast.

418
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,095
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

419
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,347
Thank you.

420
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,643
What?

421
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,272
Nothing.

422
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,449
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

423
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,959
- Hey, hey.
Hey, man. Hey, listen.
- Yeah.

424
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,502
Sorry about that.

425
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,753
[waiter] Oh, it's no problem.
It's good.

426
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,380
[Jordan] She's just
not feeling well.

427
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,007
And-and if you could bring
the cappuccino,

428
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,633
that would be great.
And then if you have eggs

429
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,051
and you could bring the eggs,
that would...

430
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,095
That's fantastic.
If not, that's totally fine.

431
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,430
- [waiter] Yeah, of course, sir.
- [Jordan] Yeah.

432
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,973
- And thanks again.
- [waiter] Sure, sure.

433
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,143
- [Jordan] Appreciate it.
- [waiter] Yeah.

434
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,563
So, my mom's coming
into town this weekend.

435
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,273
Mm, really?

436
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,275
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't know
she was visiting.

437
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,611
Or did you tell me and I forgot?

438
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,029
She's going on a cruise
with my aunt

439
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,780
that-that leaves from New York.

440
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,033
- Mm.
- And so she's flying in
a little early

441
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,910
to spend some time with me.

442
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
That's nice.

443
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,873
She wants to meet you.

444
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Really?

445
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,337
And I want her to meet you, too.

446
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,633
I think we're there. Don't you?

447
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,218
Definitely.

448
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,304
Yeah. Okay.

449
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,265
So, where should we take her?

450
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,434
Maybe, like,
a nice dinner somewhere?

451
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,227
Where I don't order

452
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,939
- eggs, I promise.
- [chuckles]

453
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,983
Uh, the thing is
she-she has to be

454
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,401
on the boat by 4:00.

455
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,945
So, and-and there's nothing

456
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,113
that she loves more
when she's in town

457
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,117
than to go to this dim sum place
we both love in Sunset Park.

458
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,370
Oh. Okay.

459
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,790
So, it's kind of
a-a-a brunch type thing.

460
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,752
- Like, a early...
early afternoon type thing.
- Okay.

461
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,629
I-I know that...
I know it's not ideal,

462
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,423
uh, but I don't know when
she'll be back in town again,

463
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,425
and, uh, and like I said,
I just really want...

464
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,303
I really want
to meet her, Jordan.

465
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,515
I'm excited.

466
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,774
Stop worrying.

467
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,693
You know I'm fine.

468
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,362
I love spending time
with just you.

469
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,738
Thanks, Ma.

470
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,240
Sorry.

471
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,659
You're gonna have to tell her
it's her fault that I ate

472
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,537
twice as many dumplings
as I planned to, though.

473
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:33,084
I'm... I'm gonna... I'm just
gonna tr-try one more time.

474
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,050
[phone vibrating]

475
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,263
Oh, shit!

476
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,557
Um, I'm so sorry. I'm on my way.

477
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,976
Don't-don't bother.
We're-we're almost done here.

478
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,519
Just glad you're okay.

479
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,479
Yeah, I-I am okay.

480
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,482
I was, um, asleep,
but I think you know that.

481
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,777
Like I said, just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

482
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,654
Listen, I'm an idiot.
I didn't set my alarm

483
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,574
because I thought
I would just stay up, but I...

484
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,908
Just go back to bed.

485
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,286
Shit. Okay.

486
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,997
[muttering]

487
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,499
Ow.

488
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,336
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm here.

489
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,173
I'm here. Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

490
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,759
- Oh, wow, you so did not
have to run down here.
- Hi.

491
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,635
Hi. I'm Zoe.

492
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,263
I'm so happy
to finally get to meet you, Zoe.

493
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,806
Me, too. I am so, so sorry.

494
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,517
Oh, don't be.
It's the weekend. You're young.

495
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,603
- No.
- I know how it is.

496
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,730
No, that's actually
not what happened,

497
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,607
- but...
- Oh, it's okay. [chuckles]

498
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,942
I look forward to getting
to know you better next time.

499
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,820
- Me, too. For sure.
- You should get going, Ma.

500
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,406
Okay. [chuckles]

501
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,993
- Mwah. Love you.
- You, too.

502
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,245
- [chuckles]
- Oh.

503
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,039
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

504
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,415
- Safe travels.
- Next time.

505
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,834
Okay.

506
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,758
I love you. Bye.

507
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,013
- I am so sorry.
- I know you are.

508
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,390
- I will make it up to you.
- You can't, but it's fine.

509
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,227
Well, if I can't,
then it's not fine,

510
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,813
so don't say it's fine
if it's not fine.

511
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:21,608
Okay, then, you know what?
It's not fine.

512
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,528
- Okay.
- I hate that
you weren't there today.

513
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,363
But-but-but it's so much
more than that.

514
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:30,826
I-I... I hate that we can't
do anything normal, ever.

515
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,828
I hate that we can't
go for a walk

516
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,205
or-or coffee and-and-and brunch.

517
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,624
- Brunch.
- Yeah, brunch.

518
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,709
I-I hate that I'm tired
all the time.

519
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,920
I hate that I have
to make excuses for you.

520
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,005
I hate that I can't dream
of a future with you

521
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,590
because who knows
what that's gonna look like.

522
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,342
A midnight wedding?

523
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,428
A baby you can't
