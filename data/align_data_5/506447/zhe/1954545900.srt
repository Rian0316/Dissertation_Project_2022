福尔摩斯探案集  

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,326

4
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:36,125
-=破烂熊字幕组=- 

5
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:44,538

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,858
有什么不对头吗?
Something wrong?

7
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:03,211
一个为了艺术而热爱艺术的人
To the man who loves art for its own sake,

8
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,711
常常是从最不重要
it is frequently in its least important

9
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,378
最为平常的形象中
and lowliest manifestations

10
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:11,127
得到最大的乐趣
that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.

11
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:17,481
这么说也没错 福尔摩斯
Oh, if you say so, Holmes.

12
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:24,501
我高兴的观察到 华生
It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson,

13
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,313
从你诚诚恳恳地为我们的
that you have so far grasped this truth

14
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,875
案件所作的记录中
that in these little records of our cases

15
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:30,229
你已经掌握了真理
which you have been good enough to draw up,

16
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:33,042
而且我肯定地讲 你有时还加以润色
and I am bound to say, occasionally embellish,

17
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,396
你加以突出的并不是那些我曾经
that you have given prominence not so much

18
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:38,458
参与过的著名案件的侦破
to the many cause celebes and sensational trials

19
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:39,291
和轰动一时的审讯
in which I have figured,

20
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,895
而是那些本身情景
but rather to those incidents

21
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,515
可能是平凡琐碎的案件
which have given room for those faculties

22
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:46,505
但给人发挥逻辑推论才能的余地
of deduction and logical synthesis

23
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,978
这正是我的特殊研究领域
which I have made my special province.

24
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,145
很高兴你这么说 福尔摩斯
Kind of you to say so, Holmes.

25
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,415
也许你确有错误
You have erred, perhaps...

26
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,268
错就错在...
you have erred...

27
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,372
总想把每项记录
in attempting to put color and life

28
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:15,518
都写的生动一些
into each of your statements,

29
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,643
而不是将你的任务限制
instead of confining yourself to placing upon record

30
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:22,913
在记述事件因果关系的推理上
that severe reasoning from cause to effect

31
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,038
这实际上是事物唯一值得注意的特点
which is really the only notable feature about the thing.

32
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,726
你用这个烟斗时
You are always in a disputatious mood

33
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:37,707
总是在争论
when you choose that pipe.

34
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,958
在这个问题上 我看我对你
It seems to me that I have done you

35
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,730
还是十分公正的
full justice in the matter.

36
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,816
不 不 不...
No, no, no, no, no, no,

37
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,422
这不是我自私或是自大
it is not selfishness or even conceit.

38
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:48,029
如果我要求公正地对待我的艺术
If I claim full justice for my art,

39
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,428
是因为犯罪是常有的事
it is because crime is common;

40
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,722
逻辑却是难得的东西
logic is rare.

41
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,371
因此 应该详细记述的
Therefore, it is upon logic rather than upon crime

42
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,040
是逻辑而不是罪行
that you should dwell.

43
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,566
你把本该是讲授的课程
You have degraded what should have been a course

44
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,902
降级成了一连串的故事
of lectures into a series of tales.

45
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,361
没错 福尔摩斯
Really, Holmes,

46
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,176
我想我的拙文达不到你的要求
I hardly think my poor scribbling deserve that.

47
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,556
可我的故事终究让你家喻户晓
They have, after all, made your name a household word.

48
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,642
啐 我亲爱的老伙计
Oh, pshaw, my dear fellow,

49
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:22,333
对于公众 不善观察的公众
what do the public, the great unobservant public,

50
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,106
他们不可能从一个人的牙齿认出他是编织工
who can hardly tell a weaver by his tooth

51
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,296
或从一个人的左拇指看出他是排字工
or a compositor by his left thumb,

52
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,987
他们会关心分析和推理的细微区别吗
care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction?

53
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,410
但是 如果你确实写的太繁琐
But, indeed, if you are trivial,

54
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:45,794
我也不能责备你 作大案子的时代已经过去了
I cannot blame you, the days of the great cases are past.

55
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,756
一个人 或至少是一个罪犯
Man, or at least criminal man,

56
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:53,093
已经没有了过去的冒险和创新精神
has lost all enterprise and originality.

57
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,699
肯定没有
Oh, surely not.

58
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,159
恐怕是的
I fear so.

59
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,183
我的小行业
As to my little practice,

60
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:03,728
似乎也退化到了处理家庭琐事
it seems to be degenerating into an agency

61
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:06,752
寻找丢失的铅笔
for recovering ost lead pencils

62
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,881
替寄宿学校的姑娘们出出主意
and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools.

63
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:12,069
亲爱的朋友
My dear, dear friend,

64
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:14,051
你怎么能这么说呢
how can you say such a thing?

65
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:18,013
我想 我已经身处事业谷底了
I think I have touched bottom, finally.

66
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,994
不管怎么说 这张我今早收到的条子
However, this note I had this morning

67
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,288
我想标志了我的最低点
marks my zero-point, I fancy.

68
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,894
老天啊 谁寄来的
Well, goodness, who is it from?

69
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,336
读一读
Read it.

70
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,591
亲爱的福尔摩斯先生
Dear Mr. Holmes:

71
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,472
我急切的想找您商量
I am very anxious to consult you

72
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:37,616
关于我是否应该接受别人聘请我
as to whether I should or should not accept a situation

73
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:40,118
当家庭女教师的问题
which has been offered to me as a governess.

74
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,558
我明天十点半来拜访你
I shall call at half-past ten tomorrow

75
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,957
如果不麻烦你的话
if I do not inconvenience you.

76
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,023
你的忠实的维奥莱特・亨特
Yours faithfully, Violet Hunter.

77
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,782
我不得不承认对这信的内容
I must confess to being somewhat puzzled

78
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,431
有点疑惑 亨特小姐
by the contents of your letter, Miss, uh, Hunter,

79
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,933
因为你咨询的问题
since the matter on which you seek advice

80
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:08,375
不在我的工作范畴之内
is somewhat outside my sual field of expertise.

81
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,147
是的 我知道
Yes, I am aware of that.

82
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,961
但是你会原谅我麻烦你的
But you will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,507
我确定 因为我最近的经历很不寻常
since I have recently had a very strange experience.

84
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:17,967
是吗
Indeed?

85
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:22,660
我没有父母或任何亲戚
As I have no parents or relations of any sort

86
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,745
可以请教
from whom I could ask advice,

87
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,726
我想也许你会好心
I thought perhaps you would be kind enough

88
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,394
告诉我应该怎么办
to tell me what I should do.

89
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,149
我将会高兴地尽力为您服务
I shall be happy to serve you in any way I can;

90
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,920
请 继续
pray, proceed.

91
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:39,238
西郊有一家出名的家教介绍所
There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End

92
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:43,097
叫维斯塔维 我最近每周都要到那里
called Westaway's, and I have lately been calling there

93
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:46,225
询问是否有
about once a week in order to see whether

94
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,830
适合我的工作
anything has turned up which might suit me.

95
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,655
经理是斯托珀小姐
It is managed by Miss Stoper.

96
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,140
她坐在自己的办公室里
She sits alone in her own office,

97
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,434
求职的女性
and the ladies who are seeking employment

98
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,309
在接待室等待接见
wait in the anteroom,

99
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:12,499
之后挨个进去
and are then shown in one by one,

100
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,899
她会在记录本上查看
when she consults her ledgers and sees whether

101
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,712
有没有适合求职者的工作
she has anything which might suit them.

102
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:20,111
格林小姐在我们的登记簿上已经很长时间了
Miss Green has been on our books for some years

103
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,093
有很好的资历
and has excellent references.

104
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,368
实际上 她的前任雇主
In fact, were it not for the swift return to Kuala Lampur

105
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,244
对她非常满意
of her present employer,

106
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,850
如果不是急于举家返回库阿拉兰珀
who finds her most satisfactory,

107
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:34,813
她今天也不会在这里待选
she would not be available today for your consideration.

108
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,883
谢谢 格林小姐
Thank you, Miss Green.

109
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:22,046
她就可以
Oh, that will do.

110
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,805
我不能要求比这更好的了
I could not ask for anything better.

111
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,791
好极了 非常好
Oh, capital, capital.

112
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,459
太好了
Splendid.

113
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,023
请坐 亨特小姐
Please be seated, Miss Hunter.

114
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,212
你是来寻找职位的吧 小姐
Now, then, you are looking for a situation, miss?

115
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,047
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

116
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:44,881
做家庭女教师?
As a governess?

117
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,715
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

118
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,487
你要求多少薪水?
And what salary do you ask?

119
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,677
我以前在斯彭斯芒罗上校那里
I had four pounds a month in my last place

120
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,137
是每月4英镑
with Colonel Spence Munro.

121
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,578
他给她的待遇已经很高了 鲁卡斯尔先生
He has given her an excellent reference, Mr. Rucastle.

122
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,142
毫无疑问 毫无疑问
Oh, doubtless, doubtless,

123
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,331
可是每月4英镑?
but four pounds a month?

124
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,251
如果那太多了...
If that seems too much...

125
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,588
太多了?不 不
Too much? oh, tut, tut,

126
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,986
怎么会有人出这么可怜的小数目
how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady

127
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,845
给一位如此有吸引力和造诣的女士?
with such attraction and accomplishments?

128
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,345
我的造诣 先生
My accomplishments, sir,

129
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:15,431
可能不如你所想像的那样深
may be less than you imagine.

130
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:19,706
懂一点法文 一点德文 音乐 绘画...
A little French, a little German, music, drawing...

131
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,540
啧 啧
Oh, tut, tut,

132
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,209
这些都不是主要问题
that is quite beside the question.

133
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:26,067
关键是你有没有
The point is, have you or have you not

134
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:29,717
具备一位有教养女士的举止和风度?
the bearing and deportment of a lady?

135
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,011
简单地说就是这一句话
I mean, that is it in a nutshell.

136
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,432
我希望自己有 先生
I would hope to have lady like qualities, sir.

137
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,370
如果你没有
If you have not,

138
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,457
你就不适合教育一个
then you are not fitted for the rearing of a child

139
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,646
家世和才华
whose background and qualities point

140
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,209
直指成功未来的孩子
to a brilliant future.

141
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:47,024
倘若你有 为什么竟有人会要求你
And if you have, why, how can any gentleman ask you

142
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,570
屈尊接受少于三位数的薪水?
to condescend to accept anything under three figures?

143
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:54,845
三位数 先生
Three figures, sir?

144
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,243
这是我提供的薪水 女士
Your salary with me, madam,

145
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,893
一年一百英镑
would commence at a hundred pounds a year.

146
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,211
我都不知道说什么了
I hardly know what to say.

147
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,755
这也是我的习惯
It has also been my custom to advance my young ladies

148
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:14,448
预付一部分的薪水给我的年轻的小姐
a small portion of their salary beforehand,

149
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,514
好让她们应付旅费上的开支
so that they might meet any little expenses

150
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,809
并置办一些衣服
of their journey and their wardrobe.

151
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,310
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

152
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,210
可否问问你住在什么地方吗
May I ask where you live?

153
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,817
汉普郡 可爱的乡村地区
Oh, Hampshire, charming rural place,

154
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,277
铜山毛榉
The Copper Beeches,

155
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,884
离温切斯特只有5英里
five miles on the further side of Winchester.

156
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:38,950
是最可爱的乡村
Oh, it is the most lovely country,

157
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:43,746
亲爱的小姐 还有最可爱的老房子
my dear young lady, and the dearest old country house.

158
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:45,415
我的职责呢?
And my duties, sir?

159
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,292
我很想了解一下
I should be glad to know what they would be.

160
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,358
一个孩子 刚刚六岁的小淘气
One child, one dear little romper just six years old.

161
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,922
多好啊
How charming.

162
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:56,259
斯托珀小姐 你要是能看到
Oh, Miss Stoper, if you could only see him

163
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,240
他用拖鞋打死蟑螂
killing cockroaches with a slipper,

164
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,410
一眨眼的功夫 三只就报销了
three of them gone before you could wink.

165
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,079
很聪明
Very clever.

166
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,250
我唯一的工作
My sole duties, then,

167
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,856
就是 照顾一个孩子?
are to take charge of a single child?

168
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,255
不 不 不...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

169
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,444
不是唯一的 我亲爱的年轻的小姐
not sole, my dear young lady.

170
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:18,155
还有什么?
Oh, what else, then?

171
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,302
你的责任是
Well, your duty would be,

172
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,971
我肯定你聪明的头脑能意识到
as I am sure your good sense would suggest,

173
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:24,515
听候我妻子的任何命令
to obey any little commands that my wife might give.

174
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,434
你是说命令?
You said commands?

175
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:29,729
假如有的话 当然
Provided, of course,

176
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,232
这些命令是一位小姐
that they were such commands as any young lady

177
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,004
理应遵从的话
might with propriety obey.

178
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,340
你看 没有任何困难吧?
You see no difficulty?

179
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,407
不 什么都行
None, whatsoever.

180
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,411
很乐意能够帮得上忙
I should be happy to make myself useful.

181
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,767
太好了
Quite so.

182
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:52,146
说说服装  比如说 我们都是我们喜欢时尚
In dress, for example, we are faddy people,

183
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:56,109
你知道 时尚癖 但心眼不坏
you know, Miss Hunter, faddy, but kind-hearted.

184
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:58,090
倘若我们给你衣服
And if you were asked to wear any dress

185
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,549
让你穿的话
that we might give you,

186
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,721
你不会反对我们小小的怪癖吧?
you would not object to our little whims, huh?

187
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,475
为什么 不会啊
Why, um, no.

188
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,664
叫你坐在这里 坐在那里
Or to sit here, or to sit there,

189
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,001
不会让你不高兴吧
and that would not be offensive to you?

190
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,982
不会
No.

191
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,403
或者你来之前 把头发剪短一点
Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?

192
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:24,574
剪短头发?
Cut my hair?

193
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:26,035
剪得很短
Quite short.

194
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,185
我想这可能不行
Well, I am afraid that's quite impossible.

195
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,375
恐怕这点很重要
And I am afraid it is quite essential.

196
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,295
这是我妻子的小小癖好
It's a little fancy of my wife's,

197
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,841
夫人们的癖好 我亲爱的小姐
and ladies' fancies, my dear madam,

198
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,760
夫人们的爱好必须得考虑
ladies' fancies must be consulted.

199
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,162
那么 你不打算剪掉头发?
So you won't cut your hair?

200
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,020
不 先生 实在不行
No, sir, I'm afraid I could not.

201
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:04,405
好吧 真可惜
Ah, well, it is a pity,

202
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,845
因为其它方面你实在很合适
because in other respects you might have done very nicely.

203
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,931
既然这样 斯托普小姐
In that case, Miss Stoper,

204
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,017
我最好再看几个姑娘
I had best inspect some more of your ladies.

205
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,045
亨特小姐
Miss Hunter,

206
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,695
你愿意将姓名保留在登记簿上吗?
do you desire your name to be kept upon our books?

207
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:25,674
如果你乐意的话 斯托普小姐
If you please, Miss Stoper.

208
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:29,638
其实 登记似乎也没有什么用处
Well, really, it seems rather useless,

209
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,975
既然你用这种方式拒绝了最优厚的待遇
since you refused the most excellent offer in this fashion,

210
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:36,624
我们很难再为你寻找
you could hardly expect us to exert ourselves

211
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,813
一个这样的机会
to find another such opening for you.

212
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,586
抱歉 斯托普小姐 但是我的头发...
I'm sorry, Miss Stoper, but my hair...

213
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:42,149
再会 亨特小姐
Good day, Miss Hunter.

214
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,927
到底为什么他会让你剪短头发?
Now, why on earth should he want you to cut your hair?

215
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,534
不知道
I don't know.

216
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:54,767
奇怪的要求
A very strange fact.

217
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,061
正如你所见 福尔摩斯先生
As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,

218
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,249
我的头发很浓密
my hair is somewhat luxuriant

219
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,065
有着栗子般特殊的色泽
and a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.

220
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:05,819
颇为艺术 在我看来
And most artistic, if I may so observe.

221
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,800
考虑到这些
It has been considered so.

222
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:11,554
我不能这么轻易的
I simply couldn't think of sacrificing it

223
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:12,805
为了满足别人就把它牺牲掉
in such an offhand manner.

224
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:15,203
恐怕确实是不可能的
Well, I should think not, indeed.

225
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,330
当时我就是这种感觉
Oh, such was my feeling at the time.

226
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,668
第二天我开始想
The next day I was inclined to think

227
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,231
自己是不是错了
that I had made a mistake,

228
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,151
第三天 我肯定自己错了
and the day after I was sure of it,

229
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,383
我收到了这位先生的信
when I received a letter from the gentleman himself.

230
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,469
我把它带来了 这就念给你听
I have it here, and I will read it to you.

231
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,478
亲爱的亨特小姐:
Dear Miss Hunter:

232
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,434
斯托普小姐将你的地址告诉了我
Miss Stoper has kindly given me your address,

233
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,929
所以写信想问一下
and I write from here to ask

234
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,313
你有没有重新考虑自己的决定
whether you have reconsidered your decision.

235
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:46,171
我们愿意支付每季度30英镑
We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter,

236
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,446
也就是每年120英镑来补偿你
or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you

237
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,408
因为我们癖好可能带来的小小不便
for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. 

238
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,764
那你的头发呢?
And your hair?

239
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:58,058
他很坚决
He is insistent.

240
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,436
"考虑到你的头发 无疑非常遗憾
As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,

241
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:05,043
尤其是在我们短暂的会面中我就不禁赞美
especially as I could not help remarking its beauty

242
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:07,233
你美丽的头发
during our short interview.

243
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,361
但恐怕我必须坚持这一点
But I am afraid I must remain firm upon this point,

244
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,967
惟愿增加的一点薪水
and I only hope that the increased salary

245
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,053
也许足以补偿你的损失"
may recompense you for the loss. 

246
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:17,556
可以吗?
Will it?

247
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:21,204
我已经决定接受了
My mind is made up that I will accept the offer.

248
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,210
然而我想 在走这最后一步前
I thought, however, that before taking the final step,

249
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:27,982
最好把事情的全部经过
I should like to submit the whole matter

250
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,651
都告诉你
for your consideration.

251
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:31,631
亲爱的亨特小姐
My dear Miss Hunter,

252
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,718
既然你已经决定了
as your mind is already made up,

253
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,385
事情就已经解决了
the matter is settled.

254
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,680
但是 如果你发现
But, if at any time you should find yourself

255
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,139
有任何的疑惑或者遇到危险
in any doubt or danger

256
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,286
危险?
Danger?

257
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,892
你预见到什么危险?
What danger do you foresee?

258
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,290
如果能够确定 那就不叫危险了
There seems to be a danger, if we could define it.

259
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,375
但不论什么时候 白天或晚上
But at any time, day or night,

260
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,565
打一个电报我就来帮你
a telegram will bring me down to your help.

261
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,571
这足够了
Then that is enough.

262
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,513
我会马上写信回复鲁卡斯尔先生的
I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,

263
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:04,788
现在可以安心的去汉普郡了
and go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now.

264
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:06,874
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,320
福尔摩斯?
Well, Holmes?

266
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:25,225
我可不会让我的姐妹接受这样的工作
I should allow no sister of mine to accept such a situation.

267
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,112
杰夫罗・鲁卡斯尔 汉普郡温切斯特附近 铜山毛榉 

268
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:48,639
这是我的仆人 托勒 他喜欢安全一点
That's my man, Toller, he likes to keep it secure.

269
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,247
但你能理解吧 亨特小姐
But you look apprehensive, Miss Hunter.

270
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,123
完全可以 鲁卡斯尔先生
Not at all, Mr. Rucastle.

271
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,792
太好了 太好了
Good, good.

272
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,679
你肯定是爱德华
You must be Edward,

273
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,451
我很期待见到你
I have looked forward to meeting you.

274
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:31,703
爱德华少爷
Master Edward,

275
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,997
这是你新的家庭教师 亨特小姐
this is your new governess, Miss Hunter.

276
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,314
看来你给亨特小姐准备了见面礼
Oh, I see you have a present for Miss Hunter.

277
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,296
干得好 好枪法
Oh, well done, good shot.

278
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:44,319
铜山毛榉?鲁卡斯尔先生
Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle?

279
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:49,116
全死了 亨特小姐 大部分都死了
All dead, Miss Hunter, mostly dead.

280
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,915
就是这里 进来 进来
Here we are, then, come in, come in.

281
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,879
托勒夫人 这位是维奥莱特・亨特
Oh, Mrs. Toller, this is Miss Violet Hunter,

282
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:06,841
她是爱德华小主人的家教
who is taking up the position of governess to Master Edward.

283
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,035
你好 亨特小姐
How do you do, Miss Hunter?

284
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,476
你的房间已经准备好了
Your room is all ready for you.

285
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,728
谢谢
Thank you.

286
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:22,064
现在去 托勒 把行李搬过来
Come along now, Toller, fetch the trunk.

287
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:27,591
亨特小姐 等你休息过后
Oh, Miss Hunter, after you are refreshed from your journey,

288
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,510
我带你去游览铜山毛榉
I'll take you on a tour of The Copper Beeches.

289
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,903
房子很大 鲁卡斯尔先生
The premises is certainly extensive, Mr. Rucastle.

290
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:54,075
是的 这么大的房子需要好好防护
Oh, yes, and the extensive premises need protection.

291
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:57,098
看 是不是很漂亮
Look in here, isn't he a beauty?

292
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,895
别害怕 亨特小姐
Don't be frightened, Miss Hunter,

293
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:03,771
它是卡罗 我的看门犬
it's only Carlo, my mastiff.

294
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,587
我称它为我的 但实际上
I call him mine, but in fact,

295
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:09,297
托勒是唯一能驯服它的人
Toller is the only man that can do anything with him.

296
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,861
他晚上就放它出来
He lets him loose at night,

297
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,615
上帝保佑那些置身它利牙之下的路人
and God help any trespasser he lays his fangs upon.

298
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,430
我们每天喂他一次 但喂的不多
We feed him once a day, and not too much then,

299
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,725
所以他总是很饥饿
so that he is always keen as mustard.

300
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,416
看在上帝的份上 亨特小姐
Oh, for goodness sakes, Miss Hunter,

301
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,317
晚上无故跨过这道门槛的话
under no pretext set foot across this threshold at night;

302
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,444
很可能会丧命的
it's as much as your life is worth.

303
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,151
鲁卡斯尔夫人马上就来
Mrs. Rucastle will be here shortly,

304
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,968
她会让你知道她有多么高兴
and she will tell you herself how delighted she is

305
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,053
你接受了这个工作
you are able to accept this situation.

306
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,389
你的待遇非常丰厚 先生
Your offer was a most generous one, sir.

307
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,939
可是 我还是对你们的要求很好奇
Though, well, I am still curious about the conditions.

308
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:11,338
你是说我小小的癖好?
My little fads and fancies, you mean?

309
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,483
是的
Yes.

310
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,194
其实没什么
But they're nothing at all.

311
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:19,678
我妻子特别喜欢一种颜色
My wife is very fond of a particular shade

312
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,868
铁蓝色
of electric blue,

313
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,204
她希望你早上能够在家
and she would like you to wear such a dress indoors

314
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,353
穿这样的衣服
in the morning.

315
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,960
但是我并没有这样的衣服
But I do not have such a dress.

316
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:33,024
但我们有
Ah, but we have one.

317
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,467
说到坐在这里 那里
As to sitting here or there

318
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:40,011
或者用任何方法逗你笑
or amusing yourself in any matter indicated,

319
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,599
不会让你感到不方便吧?
well, that need cause you no inconvenience, need it?

320
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,102
不
No.

321
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:00,968
你好 亨特小姐
How do you do, Miss Hunter?

322
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:03,576
很抱歉没去迎接你
I'm sorry I was not here to greet you,

323
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:06,912
微有小恙在身
a slight indisposition.

324
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,415
我想你现在已经好多了吧?
I trust you are feeling better now?

325
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:11,814
好很多了 谢谢
Much better, thank you.

326
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:14,733
我刚才在和亨特女士讲蓝衣服的事
I was just telling Miss Hunter about the blue dress.

327
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,779
是的 我想那衣服你穿肯定很合身
Yes, I think it would fit you very well.

328
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:47,948
我在想这案子究竟会是
I wonder what desperate circumstances

329
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,825
在什么样的恐怖环境下引起的?
could occasion such an appeal?

330
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:52,328
我曾想过七种假设
I have devised seven separate explanations,

331
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,934
每种都适用于现在我们知道的事实
each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.

332
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:59,313
你更倾向于哪种 福尔摩斯?
Oh, and which one do you favor, Holmes?

333
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,023
目前为止还没有比较偏好的
At the moment, I have no favorites.

334
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:09,427
材料 材料 材料 没有粘土我没法做出砖头来
Data, data, data, I cannot make bricks without clay.

335
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:13,808
能远离贝克街的
Well, it's nice to get away from the fogs

336
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:15,475
乌烟瘴气太好了
of Baker Street now and again.

337
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:18,810
多么漂亮的小农房啊
What delightful little farms these are,

338
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,314
你不觉得他们清新美丽吗?
don't you agree, aren't they fresh and beautiful?

339
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:23,086
你知道 华生
You know, Watson,

340
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,694
我性格被诅咒了的一个表现就是
it is one of the curses of having a mind

341
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,133
每件事都要和自己研究的
with a turn like mine that I must look at everything

342
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:32,888
特殊问题联系起来
with reference to my own special subject.

343
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,556
但这不会让风景的美丽
Well, it doesn't make the scenery

344
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:36,225
有损一分一毫 不是吗?
any less admirable, does it?

345
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:38,726
你看这些零星散布的农房
You look at these scattered houses,

346
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,290
他们的秀丽给你留下深刻印象
and you are impressed by their beauty.

347
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:43,316
我看到它们时 心里涌现的想法是
I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me

348
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,921
总感觉它们非常孤立
is a feeling of their isolation

349
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,946
会使可能发生的罪行得不到应有惩罚
and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.

350
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:50,926
我的天啊
Good heavens,

351
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:55,097
谁会把犯罪和这些可爱的老农房联系起来
who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?

352
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:57,911
它们总使我充满恐怖之感
They always filled me with a certain horror.

353
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:01,979
这是我的信条 根据我的经验
It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience,

354
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:05,210
伦敦最卑贱 最恶劣的小巷
that the lowest and vilest alleys in London

355
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,818
也不会发生比这令人愉悦的美丽的乡村里
do not present a more dreadful record of sin

356
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:10,424
更恐怖的犯罪行为了
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.

357
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:13,865
向我们求援的这位小姐
Had this young lady who appeals to us for help

358
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,638
要是住在温切斯特
gone to live in Winchester,

359
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,827
我绝不会为她担心
I should never have had a fear for her.

360
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:23,457
但危险在于这五英里之外的农村
It is the five miles of country which makes the danger.

361
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,260
这能说明什么 福尔摩斯?
What can it mean, Mr. Holmes?

362
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:59,013
恐怕没有足够资料 我们还不能下定论
We cannot theorize without data, I'm afraid.

363
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:03,288
请继续说 亨特小姐
Please, continue, Miss Hunter.

364
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,103
首先
In the first place,

365
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,980
总的来说
I may say that I have met, on the whole,

366
00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:10,587
我没有受到
with no actual ill-treatment from

367
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:12,359
鲁卡斯尔夫妇的虐待
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle.

368
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,383
但我很不放心
But I am not easy in my mind about them,

369
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,513
而且也不能理解
and I cannot understand them.

370
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,223
不能理解什么
What can't you understand?

371
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,663
为他们行为的辩解的理由
The reasons for their conduct.

372
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:28,208
我到铜山毛榉后 头两天
For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches,

373
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,085
生活很平静
my life was very quiet.

374
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,986
第三天 我吃过早饭下楼到绘画室
On the third, I went downstairs after breakfast to find

375
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:37,071
去找鲁卡斯尔夫妇
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle in the drawing room.

376
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,451
鲁卡斯尔先生提到了那件衣服
Mr. Rucastle informed me that a dress,

377
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:44,787
把一件铁蓝色的衣服
an electric blue dress,

378
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,768
放在了我的卧室里
had been laid out for me in my bedroom,

379
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:48,331
要求我穿上
and asked me to put it on.

380
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:50,834
我照他说的做了
I did as he requested.

381
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,072
太棒了 亨特小姐 太棒了
Oh, superb, Miss Hunter, oh, quite superb.

382
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:23,470
你不觉得吗
Do you not agree?

383
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,452
再合身不过了
It could not be a better fit,

384
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:28,162
就像特地量身制作的一样
not if you had been measured for it.

385
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:31,917
请坐下 亨特小姐
Please, be so good as to sit down, Miss Hunter.

386
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:37,755
完美 太好了 真完美
Oh, perfect, I mean, it's quite, quite perfect.

387
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:40,362
坐这里 如果不介意的话 亨特小姐
Over here, if you don't mind, Miss Hunter.

388
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,803
看啊 看啊 多么漂亮
There, there, there now, excellent.

389
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:46,097
你觉得舒适吗?
Are you quite comfortable?

390
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,765
是的 谢谢
Yes, thank you.

391
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,044
你希望我在这里坐多久 先生?
How long do you wish me to remain here, sir?

392
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,528
一个小时 可能更久
Oh, an hour, perhaps, perhaps longer.

393
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,615
一个小时?
An hour?

394
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:06,116
但是 我保证绝对不会是无聊的一个小时
Oh, but not, I assure you, an hour of tedium.

395
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:09,557
让我们试试逗你开心
Let us see how we can best entertain and divert you.

396
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:13,103
喜欢好玩的故事吗 亨特小姐?
Do you enjoy funny stories, Miss Hunter?

397
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:15,917
是啊 为什么?
Why, yes.

398
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,690
好吧 那我就给你说几个
Well, then, I shall tell you some,

399
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:20,193
但我保证这都是真事儿
and all of them, I assure you, absolutely true.

400
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,407
让我给你讲讲乔治的事
Let me tell you about George.

401
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:27,716
他这个人极其特别
He is the most extraordinary character.

402
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:28,732
是这样
Well, it seems, 

403
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:30,854
有人想去温切斯特
somebody wanted to find his way to Winchester,

404
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,957
然后乔治 真是个怪人
and George, he really is such an eccentric,

405
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,041
你可能会把他错当成稻草人
you might mistake him for a scarecrow,

406
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:37,917
我是说 他的腿总是劈开
I mean, his legs are all astray,

407
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:40,107
他的胳膊总是这样
his arms always thrust out like this,

408
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:43,549
他的头活像一个大头菜
his head shaved like a turnip,

409
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:47,719
他头上还带着与众不同的帽子
and on his head he wore the most extraordinary hat 

410
00:29:48,658 --> 00:29:50,533
然后 鲁卡斯尔先生
Then Mr. Rucastle,

411
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,349
在房间的另一边上蹿下跳
walking up and down on the other side of the room,

412
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:56,686
开始讲述我听过的
began to tell me a series of the funniest stories

413
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,355
最好笑的故事
I've ever listened to.

414
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:01,900
你们想不出他有多滑稽
You cannot imagine how comical he was.

415
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:05,028
我都笑累了
I laughed till I was quite weary.

416
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,511
两天以后完全相同的情景
Two days later this same performance

417
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:10,866
又上演了一遍
was gone through again.

418
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:20,042
这是上帝的和平 没人能够理解
This is the peace of God, that passes all understanding.

419
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:27,759
我的天哪!已经一个小时了?
Oh, bless my soul, is that the hour already?

420
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:31,512
时间过的真快 太有趣了 先生
Time has passed very quickly, and most amusingly, sir.

421
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:33,597
很高兴你这么说
Well, I'm glad to hear you say so.

422
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:36,726
现在干该去自己的工作了
But now, it is time for you to attend to your duties,

423
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,289
去换掉衣服
so go and change your dress,

424
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:41,209
然后去照顾小爱德华
and then look to little Edward in the nursery.

425
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,295
你不难想象 福尔摩斯先生
You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes,

426
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:45,797
我是多么难以理解这种
how curious I became as to what the meaning

427
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:49,550
异乎寻常的表演
of this extraordinary performance could be.

428
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:54,764
我察觉到他们总是小心的让我脸背对窗户
Since my face was always turned away from the window,

429
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,308
我开始好奇想看看
I became consumed with the desire to see

430
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,499
背后到底有什么东西
what was going on behind my back.

431
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,940
下一次的表演中
On the very next occasion,

432
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,528
我想办法在手里握了一块镜子
I managed to conceal a small piece of mirror in my hand.

433
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:13,324
噢 乔治 我不能告诉你...
Oh, George, I can't tell you -

434
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:16,138
当我笑的时候
In the midst of my laughter,

435
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:18,850
我将手帕举到了眼前
I raised my handkerchief to my eyes,

436
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,248
稍微摆弄了一下
and was able with a little management

437
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,334
看看我背后有什么
to see all there was behind me.

438
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:26,044
什么也没有
There was nothing,

439
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,422
至少我第一印象如此
at least that was my first impression.

440
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:34,802
第二次看的时候
At second glance, however,

441
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,992
我察觉到有一个长胡子的男人
I perceived that there was a bearded man

442
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,121
靠在场地的围栏上
leaning against the railings which bordered our field,

443
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,253
认真的朝这边张望
and was looking up earnestly at the house.

444
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:48,254
我把举着的手帕放低 瞥了鲁卡斯尔夫人一眼
I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle,

445
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:53,675
发现她正犀利的盯着我
to find her eyes fixed upon me in a most searching gaze.

446
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:56,595
她没说什么
She said nothing,

447
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:00,139
但我相信她已经猜出我手中有镜子
but I'm convinced she divined I had a mirror in my hand.

448
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:06,917
杰夫罗 那边有个不三不四的家伙
Jephro, there is an impertinent fellow

449
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,586
盯着亨特小姐呢
who stares up at Miss Hunter.

450
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,567
真的?
Oh, does he indeed?

451
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,756
不是你的朋友吧? 亨特小姐
No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?

452
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:15,989
不是 我在这里一个人也不认识
No, I know no one in these parts.

453
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:18,803
天啊 真是不礼貌
Oh, dear me, how very impertinent.

454
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:20,264
不可容忍
Quite intolerable.

455
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:22,767
请你转过身去
Kindly turn around, Miss Hunter,

456
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:25,060
示意他离开
and motion him to go away.

457
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:29,126
当然还是不理他更好
Surely it would be better if we took no notice.

458
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:31,212
什么 让他一直这样看下去吗?
What, and have him loitering here always?

459
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,775
不 转过去 亨特小姐
No, turn around, Miss Hunter,

460
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:36,008
像这样挥手让他离开
and wave him away like this.

461
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:56,027
这是一周之前的事
That was a week ago,

462
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:59,781
之后我就不再坐到窗户边
and from that time I have not sat in the window,

463
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,493
也没穿过蓝衣服
nor have I worn the blue dress,

464
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,785
更没见过那个长胡子的男人
nor seen the man with the beard.

465
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:08,435
但是 发生了别的事情
But something else occurred,

466
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:14,691
让你最终急匆匆来找我的事情
an event which caused you to summon me with such urgency?

467
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:21,677
是 是的 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, yes, oh, Mr. Holmes,

468
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,763
我从没有这么害怕过
I've never been so frightened.

469
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:27,621
不要害怕 亨特小姐
Do not distress yourself, Miss Hunter,

470
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:32,938
打起精神来 告诉我们是什么
compose yourself, and then tell us what it was.

471
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,280
房子边上有个塔楼
There is a turret to the house

472
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:44,409
看起来根本没人住在里面
which appears not to be inhabited at all.

473
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:49,518
一扇朝向那边通往托勒家的门
A door which faces that which leads into the quarters

474
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:52,541
可以从那扇门进入那间塔楼
of the Tollers opens into the turret,

475
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:54,626
但它通常是锁着的
but it is invariably locked.

476
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,754
直到昨天我才有机会
It was only yesterday that the chance came

477
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:00,257
走过那扇门
for me to pass beyond the door.

478
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:03,906
托勒?
Toller?

479
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,157
是的
Yes.

480
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,616
原来确实是你
So it was you, then.

481
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,161
我看到门开着的时候就想到了
I thought it must be when I saw the door open.

482
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:19,977
我很害怕
I'm so frightened.

483
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:22,896
我亲爱的女士
Oh, my dear young lady,

484
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:29,464
是什么吓着了你
oh, my dear young lady, what has frightened you,

485
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:31,028
我亲爱的年轻小姐
my dear young lady?

486
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:36,868
我太愚蠢了
I - I was foolish enough

487
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,474
跑到了锁着的塔楼上
to go up into the shuttered turret.

488
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,707
你注意到是锁着的?
You noticed it was shuttered then?

489
00:36:44,272 --> 00:36:45,314
是的
Yes.

490
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,589
照相也是我的爱好之一
Photography is one of my hobbies.

491
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,445
我把那间房子作为黑室
I have made my dark room up there.

492
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:57,929
多么循规蹈矩的年轻小姐啊
What an observant young lady one has come upon.

493
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,726
里面的光线很昏暗 非常阴森恐怖
It was so lonely and eerie in this dim light

494
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,437
我很害怕 于是跑了出来
that I was frightened and ran out again.

495
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:11,588
心里还是很害怕
It's so dreadfully still in there.

496
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:14,926
只是这些?
Only that?

497
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:22,224
怎么了?你认为还有什么原因?
Why, yes, what do you think, what other reason?

498
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,872
你觉得我为什么要锁上门?
Why do you think I keep that door locked?

499
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,897
我确实不知道
I'm sure I don't know.

500
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,713
为了不让无关的人进去
It is to keep people out who have no business there,

501
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,547
你明白吗?
do you see?

502
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,902
要是我早知道...
I'm sure if I had known

503
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,362
你现在知道了
Well, you know now.

504
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:40,158
如果你再敢踏上那台阶
And if you ever set foot across that threshold again,

505
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:44,329
我就把你扔给看门犬
I'll throw you to the mastiff.

506
00:37:56,008 --> 00:38:00,804
我太害怕了不知道该怎么办
I was so terrified that I didn't know what to do.

507
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:07,268
然后我想到了你 福尔摩斯先生
Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes.

508
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:13,211
我今早从那里轻易脱身
I had no difficulty in getting leave to come

509
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,671
来到温切斯特
to Winchester this morning,

510
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,070
但我必须在3点之前回去
but I must be back by 3:00 o'clock,

511
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:19,780
因为鲁卡斯尔夫妇要去别人家拜访
for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit

512
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,553
所以整夜都不回来
and will be away all evening,

513
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,160
我得照顾孩子
so that I must look after the child.

514
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:30,415
我把我的奇遇都告诉给你了 福尔摩斯先生
Now I've told you all of my adventures, Mr. Holmes.

515
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:35,943
到底是怎么回事 我该怎么办?
What does it mean, and what should I do?

516
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:41,260
那个少有言语的孩子爱德华有朋友吗?
Does the unspeakable child Edward have a friend?

517
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,449
有
Yes, uh,

518
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,994
农场里一个同样可怕的孩子
an equally unpleasant child at one of the farm cottages.

519
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:49,080
太好了
Splendid.

520
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,563
华生医生和我会在4点半
Dr. Watson and I will arrive at the Copper Beeches

521
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,023
准时到达铜山毛榉
at 4:30 precisely.

522
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:57,421
但在我们到达之前 有一两件事
But before then, there are one or two things

523
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,090
我希望你去做
I should like you to do.

524
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,676
如果我不是认为你一位卓越的女性
I would not ask this of you, Miss Hunter,

525
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,431
我是不会让你做这些的
if I did not think you were quite an exceptional woman.

526
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,767
托勒太太
Mrs. Toller?

527
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,447
托勒太太
Mrs. Toller?

528
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:17,454
托勒太太 爱德华可能把自己锁在了地下室了
Mrs. Toller, I think Edward has locked himself in the cellar

529
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,391
地下室?
The cellar?

530
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,852
我哪里都找不到他
Well, I can't find him anywhere,

531
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,728
已经过了喝茶的时间
and it is past his tea time.

532
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:23,710
我也发现了 我不明白为什么
Well, just the same, I don't see why Master Edward

533
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,378
爱德华少爷要把自己关在地下室里
would have locked himself in the cellar.

534
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:26,733
早些时候门是开着的
Well, the door was open earlier,

535
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,027
我看见托勒拿着一个瓶子出来
I saw Toller come out with a bottle.

536
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,521
可能他去找蟑螂了吧
Perhaps he went down to look for cockroaches.

537
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,379
门锁着
It's locked.

538
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:11,985
打开了 小姐
There you are, miss.

539
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:13,133
您先请
After you.

540
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:23,664
我们的目的地
Our destination.

541
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:28,357
福尔摩斯 你确定看门犬没有被放出来吗?
Holmes, can we be quite sure the mastiff isn't loose?

542
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:31,692
到达房子之前什么也不能确定
We can be sure of nothing until we reach the house.

543
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,437
天啊 那是什么
Good God, what was that?

544
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:33,420
快来
Come quickly.

545
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:40,093
往左走 福尔摩斯先生
To the left, Mr. Holmes.

546
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:23,676
这里肯定有发生过恐怖的事情
There has been some villainy here.

547
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:27,117
看起来有人从房顶上爬过来过
It looks as though someone has gone across the roof.

548
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:32,018
爱丽丝 爱丽丝...
Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice.

549
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,089
爱丽丝?
Alice?

550
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,762
我女儿呢?
Where is my daughter?

551
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,534
我还要问你呢
That is for me to ask you that.

552
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:50,578
他女儿?
His daughter?

553
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:55,688
贼 你们这些间谍 贼间谍
Thieves, you spies, thieves and spies.

554
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:58,294
我抓到你了 不是吗
I have caught you, have I?

555
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:00,171
你在我手心里了
I have you in my power.

556
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:01,943
我来好好伺候你
I'll serve you.

557
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:05,696
他什么意思?
What does he mean?

558
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,617
他去放狗了
He's gone for the dog.

559
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:18,313
华生
Watson.

560
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:48,447
有人放了狗
Someone has loosed the dog.

561
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:50,323
它已经两天没有喂食了
It's not been fed for two days.

562
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:52,305
快点 不然就迟了
Quick, before it's too late.

563
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:42,771
还昏迷着
Still unconscious.

564
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:44,543
我已经尽力了
I've done what I can for him,

565
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,524
他需要立刻进行手术
he now needs a surgeon as soon as possible.

566
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:48,400
我已经派托勒叫鲁卡瑟尔夫人
I've dispatched Toller to Mrs. Rucastle

567
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,964
去找医生
to summon such assistance.

568
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:51,425
小姐 可惜你不曾让我知道
Oh, miss, it's a pity you didn't let me know

569
00:46:51,462 --> 00:46:52,676
你的打算
what you were planning,

570
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:55,075
我本来早点可以告诉你 省得你费那么大的劲
I could have told you your pains were wasted.

571
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:56,847
很明显 托勒太太
It's clear Mrs. Toller knows

572
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:58,828
比谁都了解这件事
more of this matter than anyone else.

573
00:46:58,865 --> 00:47:02,477
是的 先生 我知道 我...
Well, yes, sir, I do, and I'm...

574
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:04,459
我已经准备好把我知道的一切告诉你
I'm ready enough to tell you what I know.

575
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:08,523
但是如果警察要介入这件事
But if there's police court business over this,

576
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,965
记住我是爱丽丝小姐的朋友
you will remember I was Miss Alice's friend.

577
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:14,468
爱丽丝小姐?
Miss Alice?

578
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:20,307
鲁卡斯尔先生第一次结婚时的女儿
Mr. Rucastle's daughter by his first marriage.

579
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:24,791
也就是锁着的塔楼的秘密
Ah, the mystery of the shuttered turret.

580
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:27,086
托勒太太 请坐下说
Mrs. Toller, please sit down.

581
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:31,150
告诉我你知道的一切
Now, tell me all you know.

582
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:35,948
她在家里从来没有开心过
Well, she was never happy at home,

583
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:37,824
爱丽丝小姐
Miss Alice wasn't,

584
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:40,535
从他父亲再次结婚开始
from the time that her father married again.

585
00:47:40,953 --> 00:47:43,663
她...她开始有点冷漠
She - she was slighted like,

586
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,747
什么话也不说
and had no say in anything.

587
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:49,398
可是... 事情开始好转
But - but it didn't became bad for her

588
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,109
当她遇到了富勒先生
until after she met Mr. Fowler.

589
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:56,488
请问 谁是富勒先生?
And pray, who is Mr. Fowler?

590
00:47:57,114 --> 00:47:59,095
他是爱丽丝小姐年轻的男朋友
Well, he was Miss Alice's young man.

591
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:05,455
你... 你可能看到过他在附近
You - you might have seen him hanging about,

592
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,541
场地边的路上转悠
out in the road by the field.

593
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:08,896
是的
Yes.

594
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,711
富勒先生的卷入
And how did Mr. Fowler's involvement

595
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:14,840
又给绝望的爱丽丝带来了什么?
bring Miss Alice to her distressing circumstances?

596
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:18,802
据我所知
Well, as far as I could learn,

597
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:20,983
爱丽丝小姐有母亲遗嘱里
Miss Alice had rights of her own 

598
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:23,129
赋予的权利
under her late mother's will,

599
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:26,622
但她是如此安静和忍让
but she was so quiet and patient, she was,

600
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:28,290
从来不提权利的事
she never said a word about them

601
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:31,730
而是将一切都交给鲁卡斯尔先生处理
but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands.

602
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:33,712
他知道和她在一起可以很放心
Well, he knew he was safe with her,

603
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:37,465
但一旦有丈夫掺和进来
but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,

604
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:40,177
他一定会要求在法律范围内应得的东西
who would ask for all the law will give him,

605
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:44,242
于是她父亲认为是该制止这事的时候了
well, then, her father thought it time to put a stop on it.

606
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:47,996
他要女儿签署一个字据
He wanted her to sign a paper

607
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:50,812
声明不管她结婚与否
so that whether she married or not,

608
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,375
他都可以用她的钱
he could use her money.

609
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:56,130
由于她不愿意签
Well, when she wouldn't do it,

610
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,674
他就一直闹
he kept worrying her, worrying her,

611
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,385
直到女儿得了脑炎
till she got brain-fever;

612
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:04,678
徘徊在死亡的边缘六个星期之久
for six weeks she was at death's door.

613
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:08,120
最后她逐渐康复
When she got better at last,

614
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:11,456
但已经骨瘦如柴
all worn to a shadow,

615
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:13,751
美丽的头发也剪掉了
and with her beautiful hair cut off,

616
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:18,026
他把她安排到塔楼去住
he moved her to the turret room,

617
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:22,196
把她囚禁在那里
where she was kept prisoner.

618
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:41,903
但这不能让她的男朋友变心
But that didn't make no change in her young man,

619
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:45,657
他仍然对她十二分的忠诚
and he stuck to her true as a man could be.

620
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:49,515
然后鲁卡斯尔先生把亨特小姐从伦敦带过来
And then Mr. Rucastle brought Miss Hunter down from London

621
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,809
来假扮她的女儿
in order to impersonate his daughter

622
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,893
这样来摆脱那个年轻人
and get rid of the young man.

623
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:55,562
是这样的 先生
Well, that was it, sir.

624
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,462
但是富勒先生是一位坚持不懈的人
But Mr. Fowler being a - a persevering gentleman,

625
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:06,301
就好像一名好水兵一样 封锁了房子
as a good sailor should be, blockaded the house.

626
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:10,681
后来遇见了你以后 通过各种手段
And having met you succeeded by certain arguments,

627
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,557
金钱还有其他方法
metallic and otherwise,

628
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,895
说服了你 使你相信你和他的利益是一致的
in convincing you that your interests were the same as his?

629
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:19,023
富勒先生是一位和蔼
Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken,

630
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,359
出手阔绰的先生
free-handed, gentleman.

631
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,947
通过这种手段 他设法让你
And in this way he managed that your husband

632
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:30,180
他设法让你的丈夫不缺酒喝 没锁好门
should not want for drink, the gates unlocked,

633
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:32,578
确保猛犬被栓好
thus insuring that the mastiff should remain chained,

634
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,871
把一把扶梯准备好
and that a ladder should be ready to assist him

635
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,540
帮助他把爱丽丝小姐救出去
in the rescue of Miss Alice?

636
00:50:37,479 --> 00:50:41,023
如你所说 就是这么一回事
You have it, sir, just as it happened.

637
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:52,910
于是铜山毛榉那所邪恶房子的
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house

638
00:50:52,947 --> 00:50:55,099
谜团解开了
called The Copper Beeches.

639
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:59,895
鲁卡斯尔先生幸免于死 但已经精神颓废
Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man,

640
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:03,544
全凭他忠心耿耿的妻子护理才苟延残喘
kept solely alive through the care of his devoted wife.

641
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:05,630
还和他们的老佣人住在一起
They still live with their servants,

642
00:51:05,668 --> 00:51:08,655
大概他们知道鲁卡斯尔家过去的事太多
who probably know so much of Rucastle's past

643
00:51:09,177 --> 00:51:13,868
鲁卡斯尔先生很难辞退他们
that he finds it difficult to part from them.

644
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:19,915
富勒先生和鲁卡斯尔小姐申请特许证书结了婚
Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married by special license

645
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:22,314
他现在任职于
and he now holds a government position

646
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:23,982
毛里求斯岛的政府中
on the island of Mauritius.

647
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:28,169
亨特女士现在担任

沃尔索尔地区一家私立学校的校长
a private school in Walsall,

649
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:39,831
我相信她在教育工作上颇有成绩
where I gather she has met with considerable success.

650
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,607
那么 福尔摩斯 你的意见呢?
There, Holmes, your verdict?

651
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:51,821
非常美好 华生
An admirable account, Watson.

652
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:57,451
你不认为我加入了太多色彩和活力吗?
Oh,you don't think I've put too much color and life into it?

653
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:01,309
我亲爱的朋友
Oh, my dear friend

654
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:04,437
我卑谦的顺从
I humbly defer such considerations

655

太好了
Good.

657
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:21,603
