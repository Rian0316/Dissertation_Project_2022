《致命女人》前情提要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Previously onWhy Women Kill...

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,660
他是个男人  有些男人是会出轨的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's a man. Some of them cheat.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,500
罗伯不会的  尤其是在失去了我们的女儿之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not Rob. Not after what happened to our daughter.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,130
我爱上你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am in love with you.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,270
你知道规则的  我永远不会离开我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You knew the rules. I will never leave my wife.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,600
要是他和她在一起那么幸福  为什么还要跟我在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why would he even be with me if he was so happy with her?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,420
或许她做了什么伤害他的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe she did something to hurt him

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,300
他需要时间去原谅她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he needs time to forgive her.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,780
我让我的炮友住进了我们家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I moved my lover into our home.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,880
我们三个正式在一起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The three of us are officially a throuple.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,270
如果我明早不能把剧本给他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My agent's gonna drop me

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,530
我的经纪人就要炒了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if I don't get him my script by tomorrow morning.

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,590
-把那50页给我  -直接说哪里不好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Give me the 50 pages. - Skip to what sucks.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,120
就是你的主人公
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That would be your lead character.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,340
-伊娃怎么了  -她差不多等了15页的篇幅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What's wrong with Eva? - She waits around for 15 pages

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,600
就希望男人来拯救她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}hoping a man will save her.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,070
她是个受害者  我讨厌受害者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's a victim. I hate victims.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,460
话说你是怎么想到这种设定的呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, how did you come up with that stuff anyway?

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,910
或许我也并不像表面看起来这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe there's more to me than meets the eye.

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,200
那家伙可是个瘾君子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The man's a drug addict.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,490
你们一半的积蓄都被他拿去买毒品了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Half your savings went up his nose.

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,120
你们一半的积蓄都被他拿去买毒品了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli has changed.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,780
等等  我有东西能帮你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on, I have something.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,580
吃掉它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take this.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,010
万一他比你更喜欢她了呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happens when he likes her more than you?

26
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,770
他说这是我写过的最好的剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He said it's the best thing I've ever written.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,940
天  我真为你高兴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, I am so happy for you.

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,990
你是在搞婚外情吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you having an affair?

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,700
卡尔  我看你是嫉妒了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, I believe you're jealous.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,070
快告诉我这人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me who it is.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,290
是我们乡村俱乐部的朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is it one of our friends from the country club?

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,330
汤米回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy's back.

33
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,440
还真是巧啊  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wasn't that lucky, dear.

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,050
汤米刚好在卧室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Seems Tommy was right there in the bedroom,

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,440
正派上用场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}ready to be useful.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,610
你不明白吗  我们不需要离婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't you see? We don't need to get a divorce.

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,920
我们无意中卷入了这完美的安排
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have stumbled into the perfect arrangement.

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,810
不是什么都是笑话的  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everything is not a joke, Karl.

39
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,770
我想要一个深爱我的男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want a man who loves me so much,

40
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,160
如果我和别人睡了  他会愿意去杀了那男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that he would kill another man if I slept with someone else.

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,140
但是你永远做不到  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm never gonna get that from you, am I?

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,140
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

萨蒙妮和我曾经关系很亲密
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone and I used to be very close,

47
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,830
在我还是她理发师的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}back when I was her hairdresser.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,950
泰勒和我不得不交际
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor and I were forced to socialize,

49
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,430
因为我是她老公的经纪人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'cause I was her husband's agent.

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,290
我完全不了解贝丝·安  尽管她是我邻居
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't know Beth Ann at all, even though she was a neighbor.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,810
我以前和她有聊不完的八卦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I used to gossip with her for hours.

52
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,350
她可喜欢我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She adored me.

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,640
我试图在派对上和她聊天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I tried to talk to her at parties.

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,850
她从来听不懂我的笑话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She never got my jokes.

55
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,960
我以前会在集市上观察她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I used to watch her at the market.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,470
她看上去人很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She seemed nice.

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,270
人是种有趣的生物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's funny about people.

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,640
他们每天都会进入我们的生活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They come into our lives every day...

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,160
你却永远不知道谁会扮演最重要的角色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and you never know who will play the most important part.

60
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,140
一个完全的陌生人可能会救你于水火之中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A total stranger might be the one to save you

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,070
也可能将你推入深渊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or destroy you.

62
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,370
老实说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To be honest...

63
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,300
我感觉他的死我有责任
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I feel responsible for his death.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,430
要不是因为我  我不确定会有人死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure anyone would've died if it wasn't for me.

65
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,640
我早知道她会杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I knew she was going to kill him.

66
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,630
我也很高兴她这么做了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I am so glad she did.

67
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,740
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Simone.

68
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,770
-你怎么来了  -这算哪门子愚蠢的问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What are you doing here? - What a silly question.

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,350
你知道我有多喜欢我们的画廊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know how much I adore our little gallery.

70
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,490
得了吧  你好几个月都没来过了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, please. You haven't stopped by in months.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
一旦我们开始谈判离婚协议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Once we begin negotiating our settlement,

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,660
我知道你会争取这个地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know you'll fight for this place.

73
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,380
你会告诉法官应该归你  因为我从没帮过忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll tell the judge it should go to you because I never helped out.

74
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,420
我这就来帮忙了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, here I am helping out.

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,180
-打扰下  -你好  有什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Excuse me. - Yes? Hello.

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,150
你们这有利希滕斯坦的作品吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you have any Lichtenstein prints?

77
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,180
我们在谈话  能回避下吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're talking. Do you mind?

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
销售员工这么有魅力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And with charm like that on our sales staff,

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,470
我们的画定会卖得很快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}these paintings should just fly off the walls.

80
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,550
今天不见汤米吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No Tommy today?

81
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,900
我们今早谈过了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We spoke this morning.

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,160
是吗  是在电话里谈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes? Was that on the phone

83
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,750
还是在床上翻身敲他肩膀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or did you roll over and tap him on the shoulder?

84
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,810
我建议我们暂时别再见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I suggested we take a break.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,570
我的离婚律师认为和青少年搞婚外情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My divorce lawyer feels an ongoing affair

86
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,330
可能会让我显得没有同情心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with a teenager could make me seem unsympathetic.

87
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,700
你聘请了律师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've hired a lawyer?

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,160
伯尼·莫顿  我前两次离婚就是他受理的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bernie Morton. He did my first two divorces,

89
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
所以他知道我的喜好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so he knows what I like.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,370
不不  我们说好要在艾米婚礼后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no, no. We-we agreed we weren't gonna get divorced

91
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,760
才离婚的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}until after Amy's wedding.

92
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,030
我们说的是在那之前不对外宣布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We agreed not to announce it till then.

93
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,530
不代表我们不能先办手续
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That doesn't mean we can't get the ball rolling.

94
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,270
可接下来几周我们会有很多事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}B-But there's so much coming at us in the next few weeks.

95
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,910
艾米的俄克拉荷马亲戚明天会全体赶到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, Amy's Oklahoma in-laws are turning up tomorrow en masse.

96
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,630
天哪  我怕极了那顿晚餐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God. I'm dreading that dinner.

97
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,440
我和布拉德的母亲就通了两分钟电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I spoke to Brad's mother for two minutes on the phone.

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,980
-已经受不了她  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I already can't stand her. - Exactly.

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,970
如果我们还吵架
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we're fighting each other,

100
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,370
怎么有精力去讨厌他们呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how will we have the energy to properly hate them?

101
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,250
你让我经历的那些事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After what you've put me through,

102
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,740
我的怒火多着是呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have more than enough rage to go around.

103
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,380
好吧  显然我们需要婚姻咨询
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right. Clearly, we need counseling.

104
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,730
能至少等到我们见过婚姻咨询师后吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, can we at least wait until after we've seen a therapist?

105
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,600
结束了  不再等了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's over. No more waiting.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,570
接受吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Accept it.

107
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,310
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well.

108
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,370
我想今天帮得够多了  回家见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess I've helped enough for one day. See you at home.

109
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,440
你看到泰勒的短信了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you see Taylor's text?

110
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
没有  我一直在写作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, no. I've been writing.

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,310
她坐了早些的飞机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She got on an early flight.

112
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,910
一会儿就到家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's gonna be here in a couple minutes.

113
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,660
-好  -我在想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, okay. - So, um, I was wondering,

114
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
你要什么时候告诉她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when you want to tell her?

115
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,920
告诉她什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell her...?

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,960
关于昨晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}About last night?

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,250
咱俩做爱的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And how-how we fucked?

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,750
你想提这茬
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You-you want to mention that.

119
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,130
毕竟发生了  我们得坦诚相对  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it happened, so we have to be honest about it, right?

120
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,710
嗯  当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sure. Yeah.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,650
-很好  棒极了  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Great. Awesome. - Yeah.

122
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,830
但我在想  你觉得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do wonder, though, um, what-what do you think

123
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,100
我们告诉她后她会怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor's reaction will be when we tell her?

124
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,350
我觉得她不会介意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I think she'll be cool with it.

125
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,970
我们是三人行关系  她也见过我们做爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, we're in a throuple, she's seen us have sex before.

126
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,190
没什么大不了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-It's-- it won't be a big deal.

127
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,060
有意思  很有意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mm. Interesting. That's interesting.

128
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,290
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

129
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,870
你觉得她可能会嫉妒吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think, you think she might get jealous?

130
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,030
也许  也许会嫉妒  也许会暴怒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe. Maybe jealous, maybe furious.

131
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,880
很可能暴怒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, likely furious.

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,980
是的  但你不觉得如果我们不说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but don't you think she'll be angrier if we don't tell her

133
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,610
她自己发现后会更生气吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then she finds out anyway?

134
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,190
你看  这就是非常流行的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It-- well, see? See, that's where the ever-popular

135
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,800
"带进坟墓"哲学派上用场的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"Take it to our graves" philosophy would come into play.

136
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,480
你想保密
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want to keep it a secret?

137
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,550
老实说  这不是我的首选
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be honest, it's not my first inclination,

138
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,220
-但听你这么一说  我喜欢  -伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- but hearing you say it out loud, I like it. - Eli.

139
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,010
不  我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I...

140
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,810
我们不能这样  感觉不对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can't. That-that feels wrong.

141
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,640
那不对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's wrong.

142
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,150
好吧  好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, all right, all right.

143
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,410
你说得对  你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're right. You're right.

144
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,730
非坦诚相待即背叛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anything less than full honesty is a betrayal.

145
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,950
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

146
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,920
她来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here she is.

147
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,720
-让我骄傲  -见鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Make me proud. - Shit.

148
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,490
-嗨  -宝贝  旅途怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hi. - Hey, babe. How was the flight?

149
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,900
哭闹的小孩  婊气冲天的空乘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Crying babies, bitchy flight attendants,

150
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,580
弄丢了我的行李箱  还有我讨厌优步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they lost my suitcase and I hate Uber!

151
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,980
你们都干了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What have you guys been up to?

152
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,460
没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh... nothing much.

153
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,030
嗯  没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,660
只是见你回家很开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just happy to have this one home.

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,870
不如给你泡个澡吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you say we put you in a bath, huh?

156
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,480
-太好了  -你值得拥有  放浴盐吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, my God. - You deserve it. Salt, no salt?

157
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,020
-多放点  -给你放满
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- So much salt. - Salt it up.

158
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,920
你干什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Whatcha doing?

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,430
我正想该把祖母的亚麻布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was just trying to think of a place

160
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,520
都存放在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to store all of Nana's linens.

161
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,520
如果世界爆发餐垫短缺危机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If there's ever a worldwide doily shortage,

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,810
我们绝对高枕无忧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we'll be sitting pretty.

163
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,720
大功告成
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is done.

164
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
正式全部开箱完毕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are now officially unpacked.

165
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,730
我以为你几周前就完成了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought you finished weeks ago.

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,060
你说不喜欢看到箱子放的到处都是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You said you hated seeing all of the unpacked boxes lying around,

167
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,470
所以我就把它们放进了阁楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I put them all in the attic.

168
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,290
每天拿一个下来开箱整理
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Every day, I would bring one down and empty it.

169
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,110
你把所有箱子都搬进了阁楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You lugged all these boxes to the attic?

170
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,490
就为了让我眼不见心不烦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just so I wouldn't have to look at 'em?

171
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,250
这没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was nothing.

172
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
你每天做那么多事取悦我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You do so many things each day to please me.

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,530
我都没注意到的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Things I don't even notice.

174
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,690
我想注意到  好谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I want to notice them, so I can thank you.

175
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,890
我不想要感谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't need to be thanked.

176
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,640
知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know,

177
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,240
过去几个月我经常加班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've been working a lot of late nights the past few months.

178
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,580
我在忙的那个项目  快完成了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This project I've been involved with, it's almost over.

179
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,880
-是吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It is? - Yeah.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,420
一旦完成后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Once I'm done,

181
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,610
我们就能回到正常时间表
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we'll get back to a normal schedule.

182
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,920
我会晚上准时回来吃饭  每晚都是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be home in time for dinner, every night.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,180
那我会非常开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That would make me very happy.

184
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,420
我们终于搬进来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, we're finally moved in.

185
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,800
该怎么庆祝呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How should we celebrate?

186
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,390
不如办个派对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why not throw a party?

187
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,070
乔迁派对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Like a housewarming thing?

188
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,670
对  我们可以把邻居都请来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, we can invite all the neighbors.

189
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,050
还有很多我没见过面呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's so many I haven't met yet.

190
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,330
那我们下周六办吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. Let's do it next Saturday.

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,260
-太好了  -很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- That would be wonderful.- Fantastic.

192
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,890
-要我帮你把这箱子扔了吗  -先别扔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You want me to throw this box away for you? - Oh, not just yet.

193
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,720
里面还有些照片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's still some photos in there.

194
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,730
我本来想把这些摆到楼上的橱柜里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was going to put those in the cupboard upstairs.

195
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,410
或许这一张该摆在外面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe we should leave this one out.

196
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,460
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really?

197
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,250
你说过这张让你难过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You said it upset you.

198
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,540
那是以前的事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eh, that was a while ago.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,380
想起来让人很心痛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It hurts to remember,

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
但忘记更糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but it'd be worse to forget.

201
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,940
你说得太对了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're absolutely right.

202
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,140
萨蒙妮  我们要迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, we're going to be late.

203
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,400
来了  着什么急
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm coming. Hold your horses.

204
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
艾米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Amy.

205
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,380
你和我们一起去吃晚饭吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you coming with us to the dinner?

206
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,940
我们以为你会跟布拉德一家去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We assumed you'd be going with Brad and his family.

207
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,130
我整天都跟他们在一起  我需要喘口气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was with them all day. I need a break.

208
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,390
他们真有那么难相处吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, are they really that bad?

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,420
你了解拖拉机吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you know much about tractors?

210
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,980
不了解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, no.

211
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,430
-到上甜点时你就了解了  -你应该喝一杯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You will by dessert.- I think you deserve a drink.

212
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,800
你这么努力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sure Brad is very pleased

213
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,810
布拉德一定很高兴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that you're making such an effort.

214
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,060
相信我  我马屁拍到飞起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Trust me, I'm sucking up like crazy.

215
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,720
如果我能留下好印象
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And if I make a good impression,

216
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,160
他父母可能会给我们买栋房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}his parents might buy us a house.

217
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,070
房子啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A house?

218
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,740
作为结婚礼物吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As a wedding gift?

219
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,480
亲爱的  我们送区区芝士火锅叉子可能不够
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling, we really need to rethink those fondue forks.

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,000
他们的农场下面埋有大量石油
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Their farm sits on millions of gallons of oil.

221
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,920
所以不管你对他们有什么看法  都友好一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So whatever you think of them, be nice.

222
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,940
-我一向很友好  -要真心的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm always nice.- Really nice.

223
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,210
不是皮笑肉不笑这种
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not bitchy nice.

224
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,190
你"绑住我手脚"了  不过行吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're tying my hands, but fine.

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
别接
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't pick up.

226
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,390
-我们迟到了  -别担心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We're late. - Uh, don't worry,

227
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,400
我们装了那种新型的机器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we've got one of those newfangled machines

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,830
能留言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that takes a message.

229
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,310
真不知道以前没有它时我们是怎么过的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, I don't know how we lived without it.

230
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,740
萨蒙妮  我是伯尼·莫顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, Bernie Morton here.

231
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,410
我在填写你的离婚文件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm working on your divorce paperwork,

232
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,670
但我还需要一些财务表格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I still need some financial forms, so...

233
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,030
伯尼  现在不是时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bernie, it's not a good time.

234
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,410
我们明天再谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll talk to you tomorrow.

235
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,100
你又要离婚吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're getting divorced again?

236
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,020
艾米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, Amy...

237
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,200
就在我婚礼之前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Right before my wedding?

238
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,520
不会影响你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It won't affect you.

239
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,720
布拉德的父母如果认为养大我的女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Brad's parents are not going to buy me a house

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,420
她的婚姻比薄荷糖的效力还短
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if they think I was raised by a woman

241
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,030
是绝对不会买房子送我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who's never had a marriage last longer than a breath mint.

242
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,480
你还怪我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're blaming me?

243
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,870
是的  因为你换了三个老公
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After three husbands, yes.

244
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,130
你这次又有什么借口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's your excuse this time?

245
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,640
这个故事很有意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a charming story.

246
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,230
没错  我俩都有有意思的故事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Y-Yes, well, we-we both have charming stories,

247
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,670
但我不想说一堆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I don't want to bore you

248
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,940
我们英国人所谓的"荒唐事"  让你无聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with a lot of what we Brits call, um, tommyrot.

249
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,080
行吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine.

250
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,020
我们走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's just go.

251
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,430
荒唐事  你不是吧  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommyrot? Really, Karl?

252
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,490
你真可笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're hilarious.

253
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,360
我们终于意见一致了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At last, we agree on something.

254
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,640
早上好  我是贝丝·安·斯坦顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good morning. I'm Beth Ann Stanton,

255
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,560
你的新邻居
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}your new neighbor.

256
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,550
我和我丈夫刚搬到附近
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My husband and I just moved in down the street.

257
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,100
我知道你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I know who you are.

258
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,010
我听说你叫玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I hear your name is Mary.

259
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,590
玛丽·弗拉辛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary Vlasin.

260
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,060
终于见面了  真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's nice to officially meet you.

261
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,090
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary!

262
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,570
那是你丈夫吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That your husband?

263
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,780
是的  现在不太方便
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, yes. Now's not a good time.

264
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,850
我很快就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be quick.

265
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,630
我有东西给你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have something for the two of you.

266
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,400
我就是为此而来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's the reason I dropped by.

267
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,500
是张邀请函
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's an invitation.

268
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,480
我和罗伯周六要办乔迁派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob and I are throwing a housewarming party on Saturday;

269
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,930
没多隆重  就是小吃和啤酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}nothing fancy. Just finger food and beer.

270
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,990
邀请了一些老朋友来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll be having some old friends, and

271
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,240
希望也有新朋友来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}hopefully some new ones.

272
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,090
我都不记得上次参加派对是什么时候了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't remember the last time I went to a party.

273
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,860
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary!

274
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,710
你觉得你们能来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, do you think you might be able to make it?

275
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,170
我就想统计下人数
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just doing a head count.

276
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,650
我说不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know, um...

277
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,370
我本来要过去的  刚才在跟新邻居说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was coming. I was just, uh, talking to our new neighbor.

278
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,720
你好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, hello there.

279
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,730
我不知道有人来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't realize we had company.

280
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,950
我是贝丝·安·斯坦顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm Beth Ann Stanton.

281
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,350
刚搬到附近
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've just moved in down the street.

282
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,100
她邀请我们去参加  派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She invited us to, uh, a party.

283
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,090
只是周六有个小小的乔迁派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh.Just a little housewarming thing on Saturday.

284
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,770
玛丽说她不确定你们是否能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary said she wasn't sure you'd be able to...

285
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,400
哪有  我们很乐意参加
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, we'd love to come.

286
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,780
-是吗  -当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Really? - Sure.

287
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,320
需要我们带点什么吗  或者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want us to bring anything, or...

288
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,930
不用  不用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. No.

289
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,250
你们两个小可爱来就够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just your lovely selves.

290
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,950
那好吧  到时见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, all righty, then. We'll see you soon.

291
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,160
太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wonderful.

292
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,400
我去问问领班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll check with the maître d',

293
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,370
看看布拉德的家人是否到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}see if Brad's family's arrived.

294
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,580
我的天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God.

295
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,050
-是赫克托  -赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It's Hector. - Hector?

296
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,340
他是我有过的最好的理发师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was the best hairdresser I ever had.

297
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,940
我是说  直到他不干了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, until he dropped me.

298
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,380
他为什么不干了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why did he drop you?

299
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,900
谁知道呢  有一天他就突然停止了预约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who knows? One day, he just stopped scheduling appointments.

300
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,970
你肯定做了什么冒犯他的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'm sure you did something to offend him.

301
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,240
你为什么会这么想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why would you assume that?

302
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,280
对哦  我很讨人厌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, right, I'm horrible.

303
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,040
艾米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Amy!

304
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,220
佩蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Patty.

305
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,350
妈  这是布拉德的姐姐佩蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mom, this is Brad's sister Patty.

306
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,340
很高兴认识你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

307
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,470
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

308
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,890
他们把我们安排在私人包间里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, they've seated us in a private dining room.

309
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,940
是你安排的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you arrange that?

310
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,510
是的  我想为我的新家人们做点什么特别的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did. I wanted to do something special for my new family.

311
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,490
真是个不错的主意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a great idea.

312
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,510
现在我们可以随心所欲大吵大闹了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now we can get as loud and crazy as we want.

313
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,850
我不知道艾米是否告诉过你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know if Amy told you,

314
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,140
我知道如何用约德尔唱法歌唱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I know how to yodel.

315
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,140
{\an8}{\fs14\fsp2\fn方正准圆简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\c&H2100DE&}以瑞士传统的真假嗓音交替歌唱

316
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
她没说过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

317
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,200
要是说过  我想我会记住的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think I would have remembered that.

318
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,780
太好了  让我们开始狂欢吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Great, let's get the party started.

319
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,380
-卡尔  大家都到了  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Karl, everyone's here. - Oh, good.

320
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,530
-你好  -你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hello. - Hi.

321
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,070
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone.

322
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,460
大伙儿好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, guys.

323
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,940
你们来啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, here they are.

324
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,220
认识你们甚是荣幸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What a pleasure it is to finally meet you.

325
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,950
我是露比  他是德怀特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm Ruby and this is Dwight.

326
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,270
-幸会  -你们好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Charmed. - Well, hello, there.

327
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,310
抱歉我们迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry we're late.

328
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,720
如果你是忙着在打扮自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, if you were busy making yourself beautiful,

329
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,410
请允许我说  任务完成了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}may I just say, mission accomplished.

330
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,790
你真坏  德怀特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Heel, Dwight.

331
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,480
看来我得防着点你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I see I'm gonna have to watch my step around you.

332
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,190
我无法告诉你们艾米能嫁给一个像你们儿子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't tell you how thrilled we are that Amy's marrying a young man

333
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,820
这么令人敬佩的年轻人我们有多激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}as admirable as your son.

334
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,540
听听这声线
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That voice.

335
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,910
他就像是PBS电视台里的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's like someone on PBS.

336
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,010
谁想来点香槟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, who wants champagne?

337
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,260
大家都想吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sure we could all be persuaded.

338
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,930
我能听他说上一整天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could just listen to him talk all day long.

339
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,970
如果你嫁给他  你会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you were married to him, you would.

340
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,110
露比和我也很喜欢你们的女儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, Ruby and I are just as crazy about your daughter.

341
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,990
我们一家都是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The whole family is.

342
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,500
佩蒂不停地讲她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Patty hasn't shut up about her.

343
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,310
因为我很开心  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Cause I'm happy, okay?

344
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,090
我终于有个妹妹了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm finally getting a sister.

345
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,820
很激动我能成为大家庭中的一员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'm thrilled to finally be a part of a big family.

346
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,010
我总是梦想举办一场大型家庭聚会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've always dreamed of hosting large family gatherings.

347
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,690
你们知道我的梦是什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what I dream about?

348
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
抱孙子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Grandkids.

349
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
我也梦到过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I've had that dream.

350
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,140
每次都尖叫着醒来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I always wake up screaming.

351
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,510
你为什么不想抱孙子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, why don't you want grandkids?

352
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,700
那我就得告诉大家我当外婆了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'd have to tell people that I'm a grandmother.

353
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,730
看看我这面相  谁会相信我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And let's face it, who's gonna believe me?

354
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,690
还有人需要香槟吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Does anyone need more champagne?

355
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,880
-天啊  需要  -需要  太需要了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God, yes. Yes, absolutely.

356
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,000
非常抱歉  我出去一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, I'm terribly sorry. Will you excuse me?

357
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,590
我非常需要去"飞流直下三千尺"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, uh, I desperately need to use the facilities.

358
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,340
听听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Listen to him.

359
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,490
撒尿都说得这么花里胡哨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He even makes taking a piss sound fancy.

360
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,240
完成了  我刚写完
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is done! I just wrote the words

361
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,610
"消逝于黑暗中"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"Fade to black."

362
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,400
我的剧本完成了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My script is complete!

363
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,750
伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli!

364
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,530
我的天哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. Oh.

365
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,520
-宝贝  太棒了  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Honey, that's amazing. - Yeah, it is.

366
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,720
你知道最棒的是什么吗  不知怎的全都通了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what's amazing? Somehow it all works.

367
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,830
我是说  角色  情节  一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, the characters, the plot, all of it.

368
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,690
我可能用了"操"这个词
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I probably used the word "Fuck"

369
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,480
六十多次  但是没关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about 60 times too many, but that's fixable.

370
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,890
重点是我也许真的能成为一个好编剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, the point is: I may actually be a good writer.

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,340
我真为你骄傲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'm so proud of you.

372
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,150
谢谢  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, thank you. Thank you.

373
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,600
我给拉马尔打了电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, so I called Lamar,

374
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,420
然后他想请我们出去吃饭庆祝庆祝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he wants to take us all out to dinner tonight to celebrate.

375
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,040
那太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, that'd be great.

376
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,640
我们应该去月夜餐厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We should go to La Serata.

377
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,450
-很好  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Ooh, molto bene. - Yeah.

378
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,470
我并不想换话题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not to change the subject,

379
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,060
但有件事我很好奇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I'm curious about something.

380
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,120
什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's up?

381
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,990
我不在的时候  你们俩是不是睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}While I was away, did you two fuck?

382
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,340
不知道为什么  我就是有这种感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know why, I just have a feeling.

383
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,030
是我疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Am I crazy?

384
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,840
我们绝对睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We absolutely fucked.

385
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,520
天  真的啊  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit. Wow. Hmm.

386
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,470
你生气了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you upset?

387
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,300
不好说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure.

388
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,370
我俩又不是趁伊莱不在的时候没睡过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not like you and I have never done it without Eli.

389
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,810
那倒也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's true.

390
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,500
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

391
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,880
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay?

392
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,550
显然我还有些感受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, obviously I have some feelings

393
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,260
需要平复
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that I need to work through,

394
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
但这是...这是注定要发生的  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but this was... this was bound to happen, right?

395
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,270
迟早的事  既然我们都住在一起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At some point, since we're all together now.

396
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,580
而且我爱你们俩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I love you both,

397
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,880
所以为何...我为何不想让你俩再走近点呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so why... why would I not want you guys to get closer?

398
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,340
是啊  没错  我就知道如果我们能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, exactly, and I-I knew that if we were just open

399
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,720
开诚布公地谈论整件事的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and honest about the whole thing,

400
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,380
会发现其实也没什么大不了的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that it wouldn't be a big deal.

401
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,010
是啊  谢谢你告诉我真相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Well, thank you for telling me the truth.

402
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,960
-知道真相后的感觉真不错  -那是当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It feels good to know. - Of course. Of course.

403
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,970
对了  你应该告诉拉马尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you know what, you should tell Lamar

404
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,750
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}发送给: 伊莱
你是个混蛋

405
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,530
我认识月夜餐厅的经理
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that I know the manager at La Serata,

406
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,650
她能帮我们预定一个好位置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so she can get us a good table.

407
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,840
好啊  好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yeah, yeah.

408
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,750
行啊  行啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Totally. Great call.

409
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,610
我会...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will, um...

410
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
我立刻传简讯给拉马尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I will, I will text Lamar right now.

411
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,480
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

412
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,720
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}伊莱:  我知道

413
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,040
我能感觉到罗伯还在生那晚的气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I can tell Rob is still mad about the other night.

414
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,660
他已经多日没打给我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He hasn't called in days.

415
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,130
我想过打给他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought about calling him,

416
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,550
但我不想让自己看起来太绝望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I don't want to seem desperate,

417
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,690
虽说我确实有点绝望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}although I am a little bit,

418
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,290
但他不需要知道这些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but he doesn't need to know that.

419
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,230
不管怎样...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway...

420
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,510
你觉得我该怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}what do you think I should do?

421
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,900
你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hmm. What?

422
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,160
你看看我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Listen to me.

423
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,900
我一直叨唠罗伯  你一定听烦了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I must be boring you to tears always talking about Rob.

424
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,360
不  不好意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I'm sorry.

425
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,100
我刚才在想今天遇到的这个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was thinking about this woman I met today.

426
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,880
她在我脑海中挥之不去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't get her out of my mind.

427
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,810
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

428
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,170
我去她家送东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was at her door dropping something off,

429
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,650
感觉事情不太对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and, just, something wasn't quite right.

430
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,000
怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do you mean?

431
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,120
她很担心她丈夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She was worried about her husband.

432
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,730
我能听到他喊她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could hear him calling for her.

433
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,950
他的语气有些奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There was just something about his tone.

434
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,090
着实吓到我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It scared me.

435
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,890
然后他来开门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then he came to the door,

436
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,150
看起来很有魅力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he was charming.

437
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,510
这个女人  她是不是画着浓妆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This woman, was she wearing a lot of makeup?

438
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,340
确实是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She was.

439
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,410
你怎么知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How did you know that?

440
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,200
他经常打她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He hits her.

441
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,500
你觉得是这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think?

442
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,820
不  他不是那种人  他事业很成功
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, he isn't the type. He's very successful.

443
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,620
我父亲是名医生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My father was a doctor.

444
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,590
我过去常常看着我母亲用化妆品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I used to watch my mother apply makeup

445
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,260
来遮盖她青肿的眼眶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to cover up her black eyes.

446
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,210
不会吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, no.

447
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,930
她会先抹绿色的遮瑕膏来遮住淤青
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She would smear green concealer to cover the bruise,

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,090
然后再涂一层遮瑕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then she would apply a second layer of concealer

449
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,830
用以匹配她的肤色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that matched her skin tone.

450
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,520
然后她会在另一半脸上再重复同样的操作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then she would do the same thing to the other side

451
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,000
这样人们就看不出来差别了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so that people wouldn't notice the difference.

452
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,850
那也太惨了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's awful.

453
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,380
不  惨的在后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, here's the awful part.

454
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,430
我们全家都知道这件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My whole family knew what was going on.

455
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,400
我的姑婶  叔伯  堂兄们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aunts, uncles, cousins--

456
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,820
他们都清楚他做了些什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they all knew what he was doing,

457
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,270
但是他们都视而不见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and they just looked the other way.

458
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,930
我恨那些视而不见的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hate people that look the other way.

459
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,960
他告诉店主无论吉布森兄弟开出什么价
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And he told the owner he was willing to match

460
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,710
他都愿意出同样的价格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}any offer the Gibson twins could come up with.

461
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,720
德怀特就是这样垄断了塔尔萨县
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And that's how Dwight cornered the Tulsa County market

462
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,580
挖掘机市场的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for earth-moving machinery.

463
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,960
在那之后...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The next thing that happened...

464
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,290
请停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please stop!

465
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,300
等我找到卡尔再讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Until I find Karl.

466
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,100
他一定不会想错过这个精彩的故事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He would hate to miss this amazing story.

467
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,700
他在洗手间待了好久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has been in the gents' room quite a while.

468
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,860
你想让我去看看他是怎么回事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, you want me to check on him?

469
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,100
不用  我去就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I-I've got this.

470
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,740
-女士  那是男厕  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Ma'am, that's the men's room. - Oh, I know.

471
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,440
我丈夫总不会躲在女厕吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My husband isn't hiding out in the ladies' room.

472
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,210
很开心我们终于见面了  拉马尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So nice to finally meet you, Lamar.

473
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,000
我听了好多关于你的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've heard so much about you.

474
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,120
我也听说了很多你的事  美女
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Heard a lot about you, too, pretty lady.

475
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,110
我有好多问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I have so many questions.

476
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,440
-求你别问  -拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Please don't ask them. - Come on.

477
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,580
今天是我请客  我唯一想要的回报
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm paying for this meal. All I want in exchange is

478
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,810
就是关于你们新生活方式的一些八卦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}a few juicy details about your new lifestyle.

479
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,880
好吧  哥们  别让我难堪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, dude, don't embarrass me.

480
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,940
我要是没必要知道我就不会问了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to know.

481
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,620
你为什么需要知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why do you need to know?

482
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,490
事实是  我一直在考虑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Truth is, I've been thinking about

483
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,330
往我和德洛丽丝的关系中再添一个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}bringing another woman into my relationship with Delores.

484
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,660
她不介意吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And she's open to the idea?

485
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,830
当然介意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Absolutely not.

486
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,600
好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, okay, all right.

487
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,270
我们来谈谈我的剧本吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's talk about my script.

488
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,970
-伊莱说你觉得不错  -不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Eli said that you think it's good. - No.

489
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,290
我觉得棒极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think it's brilliant.

490
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,130
-告诉我能卖出去  -当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Okay, just tell me it'll sell. - Oh, yes.

491
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,510
已经有四个制片人感兴趣了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I already got four different producers interested.

492
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,880
我估计出价能有六位数  接近一百万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm expecting offers in the high six-figure range.

493
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,470
你认真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you serious?

494
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,570
我只会开性的玩笑  从不开钱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I joke about sex, not money.

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,940
我以前的剧本从没有过这样的反应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I've never had a script get that kind of reaction before.

496
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,720
你从没写过这样商业的剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've never written a script this commercial before.

497
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,900
我想我们得谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I guess we have you to thank for that.

498
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,100
别
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop.

499
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,810
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

500
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,490
只是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It just--

501
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,970
伊莱有点写不下去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli was having some problems with his story,

502
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,470
所以我看了前50页的剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I read the first 50 pages,

503
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,700
给了他一些点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I-I gave him a few ideas.

504
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,910
不止一些  她可以说是救了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}More than a few. I mean, she saved my ass is what she did.

505
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,800
结尾那里  伊娃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That part at the end, where-where Eva,

506
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,050
她烧毁了那地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she burns the place down and goes,

507
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,990
然后烧死了所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}like, full-blown arsonist on everybody?

508
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,090
是洁德的点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade's idea.

509
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,620
酷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cool.

510
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,270
所以你剧本还没写完就拿给她看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, you let her read the script before it was finished?

511
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,570
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}W-Well, yeah.

512
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,720
你从没让我提前看过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Cause you never let me do that.

513
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,310
不  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No-- h-honey,

514
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,880
这次我实在是被逼入绝境了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my back was up against the wall on this.

515
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
-我  -我还
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I mean... - I-I also,

516
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
我给了他一些关于主角的想法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I gave him some thoughts on the lead character.

517
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,490
我很了解千禧一代的女生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, I have insight into the millennial female brain.

518
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,970
能看出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And it shows.

519
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,610
伊娃是他笔下最棒的人物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eva is the-the best character he's ever created.

520
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,050
这我可说不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I don't know about that.

521
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,070
我可以  相信我  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do. Trust me, Eli.

522
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,590
好好待洁德  她是你的灵感女神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be good to Jade. She's your muse.

523
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,200
-你也许是对的  -别胡说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You might be right. - Oh, that's ridiculous.

524
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,440
洁德  你有想过自己写剧本吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, Jade, you ever think about doing any writing yourself?

525
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,220
有过  我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, yeah. I-I have,

526
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,980
我其实有几个剧本的点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I actually have a couple script ideas, yeah.

527
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,210
我很有兴趣听听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I would love to hear about them.

528
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,920
-真的吗  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Really? - Yeah.

529
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,670
-失陪一下  -好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Um, excuse me for just one moment. - Yeah.

530
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,370
你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure?

531
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,740
他总是在找我的替代者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's always looking for my replacement, so please.

532
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,340
你到底是怎么想的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What in God's name?

533
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,640
该死  我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit. We...

534
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,880
我们有点忘乎所以了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We got a bit carried away.

535
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,400
我们很久没见过面了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We haven't seen each other in years.

536
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,840
我的天  所以你才不给我理发了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. Is that why you dropped me as a client?

537
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,670
因为你在上我老公
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because you were screwing my husband!

538
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,770
我不能直视你的眼睛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I couldn't look you in the eye anymore.

539
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,940
没法给你剪刘海
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was impossible to trim your bangs.

540
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,480
我想你该走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you should leave now.

541
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,030
不管有没有用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For what it's worth,

542
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,180
我喜欢你头发的层次感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I love the layers.

543
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,130
快滚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go.

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,760
你怎么能这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could you?

545
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,700
你不至于这么吃惊吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't be completely shocked.

546
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,510
你很清楚我和男人睡过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You knew perfectly well I slept with men.

547
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,890
可是和赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But with Hector?

548
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,510
你惊讶于我睡的男人是你的理发师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're surprised that the man I slept with was your hairdresser?

549
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,640
这就相当于同志性爱版的"是管家干的"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is the gay sex equivalent of "The butler did it."

550
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,790
你们在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What the hell is going on?

551
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,370
没什么  我们很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nothing. We're fine.

552
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,500
我们才不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are not fine.

553
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,860
你不会相信卡尔如何背叛了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You would not believe how Karl betrayed me.

554
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,330
我不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't care.

555
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,860
我拍了克莱皮特一家六个月的马屁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've spent six months sucking up to the Clampetts,

556
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,980
我不允许你们一夜之间给我毁了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you're not gonna blow it for me in one night.

557
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,250
赶紧出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now move it!

558
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,620
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on.

559
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:22,490
我们就别破坏她卷进不必要抓马的机会了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's not ruin her chances with unnecessary drama.

560
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,620
行  我就等到我们上离婚法庭时再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine. I'll wait till we're in divorce court.

561
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,320
我到时会做的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what I do to you then

562
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,120
就相当有必要了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}will be very necessary.

563
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,740
格雷琴  戴尔  欢迎来到我们的聚会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Gretchen, Dale! Welcome to our little shindig.

564
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,070
-你好  -谢谢邀请我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hi! - Thanks for having us.

565
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,320
天呐  你这短裤可真亮眼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wow, those are some shorts.

566
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,080
是啊  专门为派对买的  很棒吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Bought 'em special for the party. Aren't they great?

567
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,000
饭厅里有食物和饮品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's food and drink in the dining room.

568
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,200
-请自便  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Please help yourself. - Thank you.

569
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,700
-瞧吧  她喜欢我的短裤  -她可没这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- See? She liked them. - That's not what she said.

570
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,540
你好啊  贝丝·安  对曲目有什么要求吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, Beth Ann. Got any requests?

571
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,610
别弹古典曲目  除非等到我想赶客的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't play classical until I want people to leave.

572
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,660
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

573
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,720
我是怎么跟你说的  不准在家里乱跑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What did I tell you? No running in the house.

574
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,200
但这不是我们家啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it's not our house.

575
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,770
我对天发誓  本尼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I swear to God, Benny.

576
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,130
拜托  经过古巴那事  没人会投票给他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on. Nobody's gonna vote for the guy after what happened in Cuba.

577
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,200
那不重要  无论如何我都坚定认为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't matter. I can't think of one scenario

578
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,090
肯尼迪肯定会连任的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}where Kennedy doesn't get a second term.

579
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,340
那是不可能的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Never gonna happen.

580
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,750
所以你从没乘过凯迪拉克吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you're telling me you've never been for a ride in a Cadillac?

581
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,880
我很乐意带你兜兜风
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd be happy to take you around the block.

582
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,190
莉诺  你能来厨房给我帮帮忙吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Lenore, could you please help me in the kitchen?

583
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,190
真是太感谢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you so much.

584
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,670
亲爱的  麦尔斯在吹嘘他在休斯飞机公司的薪水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, Miles is bragging about his salary at Hughes Aircraft.

585
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,080
我能告诉他我的薪水吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I tell him how much I make?

586
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,510
-绝对不要  -拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Absolutely not. - Oh, come on.

587
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,570
饼干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cookies!

588
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,900
那是魔鬼蛋吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are those deviled eggs?

589
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,160
请自便
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Help yourself.

590
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,960
嗨  你们来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hi. You came.

591
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,190
当然了  我们不会错过的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course. We wouldn't miss it.

592
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,090
很抱歉我们迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry we're late.

593
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,340
别说傻话  派对才刚刚开始呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be silly. The party's only just started.

594
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,990
你这房子可真漂亮啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nice place you got here.

595
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,240
我们的确很喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We certainly like it.

596
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,890
我不想空手而来  所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I didn't want to come empty-handed, so...

597
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,750
你不必如此麻烦的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You shouldn't have.

598
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,950
不  不麻烦  我用的是现成的糕点粉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. It was no trouble. I used a mix.

599
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,460
再次感谢你邀请我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you again for inviting us.

600
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,410
亲爱的  你看  那是戴尔·克拉克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, honey, it's Dale Clark.

601
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,930
我认识他  我们应该去打个招呼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know him. We should go say hi.

602
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,490
瞧瞧他的短裤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at those shorts.

603
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,280
泰勒  你还在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor? Are you still in here?

604
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,070
泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor?

605
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,450
你在这儿啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There you are.

606
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,990
你还好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you okay?

607
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,770
男人们都开始担心了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The boys are starting to worry.

608
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,880
我没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm fine.

609
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,440
-你确定吗  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Are you sure? - Yeah.

610
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,740
在方便呢  马上就出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Doing my thing. I'll be out in a minute.

611
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,480
那你的裤子为什么没脱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are your pants on?

612
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,460
那你为什么这么奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are you being weird?

613
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,860
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry.

614
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,620
听着  如果你生气了  我完全理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I understand if you're upset.

615
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,540
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you?

616
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,180
我和伊莱之间发生的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happened with me and Eli

617
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,570
显然触发了某些伤痛的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}has obviously triggered some hurt feelings,

618
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,710
我真的完全理解的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I totally get it.

619
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,380
洁德  如果我说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade, believe me when I say

620
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,330
我完全不在乎你跟我丈夫上床的事  请你信我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't give a fuck if you screwed my husband.

621
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,560
好吧  那问题到底是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, so then what's the problem?

622
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,780
他的灵感女神  那是什么狗屁话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His muse? What kind of over-the-top undeserved bullshit is that?

623
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,920
好吧  他只是想说些客气话而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, he was just trying to be nice.

624
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,750
你没有拯救他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You didn't save him.

625
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,930
你不过是抛出一些想法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You toss out a couple ideas

626
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,180
在他熬夜时  给他到咖啡而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and poured him coffee while he pulled an all-nighter.

627
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,340
过去两年  他把我们的生活毁得千疮百孔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am the one who spent the last two years

628
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,040
收拾烂摊子的人是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}cleaning up the mess he made of our lives.

629
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,450
-他干什么了  -他什么没干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What did he do? - What didn't he do?

630
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,490
安非他命  可卡因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Speed, cocaine...

631
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,130
老天呐  我都能写个清单出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Christ, I can write you a list,

632
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,910
但这地方半夜就打烊了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but this place closes at midnight.

633
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,120
洁德  他是个瘾君子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade, he's an addict.

634
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,110
他曾经差点死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He almost died.

635
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,640
如果不是我强迫他戒毒  他已经死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And he would've if I didn't force him into rehab.

636
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,910
我之前不知道这事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I didn't know that.

637
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,120
你怎么可能知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, how could you?

638
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,890
我什么都没说  因为...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't say anything because...

639
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,640
我以为我们已经没事了   但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought we were fine and...

640
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,740
你来了以后  就...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just having you here, it's...

641
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,130
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

642
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,570
老天  这暴露出了我们之间的感情的裂缝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Man, that's just shining a light on the cracks in our relationship.

643
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,310
-我不是有意...  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I don't mean to... - I know.

644
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,330
这不是你的错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not your fault.

645
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,510
你没做错任何事  我只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You did nothing wrong. I'm just...

646
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,910
我也说不清
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

647
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,350
我只是不太确定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just not sure

648
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,930
当前的共处形式是否可以成立
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the current living situation is working.

649
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,520
你的意思是你希望我离开吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you saying you want me to go?

650
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,800
我也不知道我是什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know what I'm saying.

651
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,220
我只是觉得  目前的这种关系是行不通的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just don't think this whole thing's working.

652
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,120
希拉  希拉  快来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila! Sheila! Come on.

653
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,140
你干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What're you doing?

654
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,730
你没听到吗  他们在弹奏《扭扭舞》呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't you hear? They're playing "The Twist."

655
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,530
真是太棒了  我在吃派呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's terrific. I'm eating pie.

656
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,680
别吃什么派了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forget about the pie.

657
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,660
-快来  我想跳舞  -你的舞伴在这儿呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Come on. I want to dance. - Well, here's your partner.

658
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,140
她就跟我一样  不过更小  更娇弱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's just like me, but smaller and stickier.

659
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,840
来吧  亲爱的  等我们跳完舞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on, honey, and after we're done dancing,

660
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,560
爸爸要跟你讲讲那些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Daddy's gonna tell you about all the nice women

661
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,840
他本该娶的所有好女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he should've married.

662
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,900
嗨  要来一起跳吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hi. Joining us?

663
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,930
我看看  抬起腿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's see it. Lift your leg.

664
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,500
-你还好吗  格雷琴  -我的高跟鞋跟断了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You okay there, Gretchen? - I broke my heel.

665
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,860
我马上回来  阿斯泰尔先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be right back, Mr. Astaire.

666
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,540
你跳得太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're a killer.

667
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,440
她才是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, she is.

668
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,740
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary.

669
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,030
可以邀请你跳支舞吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}May I have this dance?

670
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,310
不  算了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I don't think so.

671
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,110
拜托  别让我独自跳舞啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aw, come on. Don't make me dance alone.

672
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,210
真的  我有两只左脚[不会跳舞]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Seriously, I have two left feet.

673
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,360
跟我的加一起我们就有四只脚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, add them to mine and we'll have four.

674
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,280
-好吧  就跳一下  -这就对了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Okay, just for a minute. - Yeah, now you're talking.

675
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,700
你跳得不错啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at you go.

676
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,650
抬起手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hands up!

677
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,210
我的错  你跳得很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mistake. Oh, you're doing great.

678
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,030
过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on.

679
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,000
-我们只是在跳舞  -我说了过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We were only dancing. - I said come on!

680
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,090
伙计
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Buddy.

681
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,750
没有必要这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's no need to be like this.

682
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,110
你可以随心所欲绿你妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can cheat on your wife all you want,

683
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,850
但是休想碰我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you're not touching mine.

684
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,960
你看到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you see that?

685
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,020
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

686
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,490
他当着所有人的面把她抓走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He just grabbed her and pulled her away in front of everyone.

687
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,230
他很生气她在跟我跳舞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was angry that she was dancing with me.

688
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,340
这不是借口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's no excuse.

689
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,700
他们进书房去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They went into the study.

690
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,230
你得去确保他没有伤害她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You need to make sure he's not hurting her.

691
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,440
怎么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well?

692
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,650
他们婚姻中的事情跟我们没有关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happens in their marriage is none of our business.

693
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,070
所以我们才去参加各种派对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that why we go to parties?

694
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,130
好让你能跟陌生男人调情吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you can flirt with strange men?

695
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,860
人们可以听到你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}People can hear you.

696
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,410
或者是你就喜欢侮辱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or do you just enjoy humiliating me, huh?

697
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,270
能出去吗  这是私人对话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you mind? This is a private conversation.

698
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,810
如果我们太吵了  我向你道歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I am so sorry if-if we are being too loud.

699
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,210
我们很快就会离开  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll be out of here in two shakes of a lamb's tail, okay?

700
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,160
听着  这不是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, this is not my fault.

701
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,610
她总是喝太多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She always drinks too much.

702
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,820
我刚刚在饭厅里摆上了一份天使蛋糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've just set out some angel food cake in the dining room.

703
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,160
你们不去吃一块吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't you go have a slice?

704
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,590
不了  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, thank you.

705
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,130
我们要回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're going home.

706
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,990
或许你想再多待一阵子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe you'd like to stay a little longer?

707
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,570
给他个冷静的机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give him a chance to cool off.

708
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,330
这只会让事情变得更糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That'll just make it worse.

709
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,810
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary.

710
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,140
能像你这样坚强
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It must be a wonderful thing

711
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,620
一定很棒吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to be strong like you.

712
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,210
所以我们才变成了美南浸信会教徒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the reason we became Southern Baptist.

713
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,470
循道宗教徒有点过于自由了  不合我们口味
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Those Methodists were just a little too liberal for our taste.

714
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,640
酒瓶就别拿走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Leave the bottle.

715
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,210
亲爱的  你不觉得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My darling, don't you, uh,

716
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,610
你喝得够多了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}think you've had enough?

717
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,550
对你  我确实是受够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of you? Yes.

718
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,860
霞多丽吗  绝对不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of chardonnay? Never.

719
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,600
佩蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Patty!

720
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,540
看看你的新裙子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at your new dress.

721
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,380
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, darn.

722
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,250
艾米帮我买了时髦的衣服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Amy helps me buy something chic

723
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,910
我第一次穿就把它弄脏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I ruin it first time out.

724
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,580
我们明天再去购物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll just go shopping again tomorrow.

725
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,870
你需要爽身粉来除掉丝绸上的油渍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For grease on silk, you want talcum powder.

726
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,980
租车里有个旅行装的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's a travel size in the rental car.

727
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,050
好   失陪下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay. Excuse me.

728
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,890
布拉德跟我说你们俩一起开了艺术画廊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Brad tells us you two run an art gallery together.

729
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,890
感觉如何
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's that like?

730
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,180
-有趣  -很有挑战性
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Fun. - Challenging.

731
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,710
是很有挑战性  但也很有趣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a challenge, but a fun one.

732
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,430
不像我们的婚姻  完全就是挑战
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Unlike our marriage, which is purely a challenge.

733
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,980
说起婚姻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Speaking of marriage,

734
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,040
我很好奇  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just curious, Simone,

735
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,950
你结了几次婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how many times have you been married?

736
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,060
就三次  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just three. Why?

737
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,990
只不过是个无关痛痒的问题而已  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's just an innocent question, my love.

738
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,960
-我没在跟你说话  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I wasn't talking to you. - I know.

739
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,430
你为什么那么生他的气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are you so cross with him?

740
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,950
我没有生气  我有生气吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wasn't cross. Was I cross?

741
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,440
你绝对生气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You were definitely cross.

742
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,470
当然了这不关我事  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, not that it's any of my business, but...

743
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,960
如果我离过两次婚  能遇到卡尔这样的男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if I were twice divorced, then hooked a man like Karl,

744
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,320
我会更加善待他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd treat him a little nicer.

745
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,720
换到我好奇了  露比
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now I'm curious about something, Ruby.

746
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,070
如果你走进盥洗室里看到他跟男人接吻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How would you treat Karl if you walked into the bathroom

747
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,890
你会怎么对待他呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and found him kissing another man?

748
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,550
真棒  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bravo, Simone.

749
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,150
没错  甜心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's right, sugar.

750
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,450
卡尔是同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl is gay.

751
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,170
还对他有感觉吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Still have a crush on him?

752
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,660
你继父是同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your stepdad is gay?

753
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,470
我以为他的谈吐举止是因为他是英国人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought he was just English.

754
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,250
这就是我们离婚的原因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's why we're getting divorced.

755
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,700
天哪  又要离婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dear God. Another divorce?

756
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,490
这不是重点  德怀特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not really the headline, Dwight.

757
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,560
你这个可怜的女人啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you poor, tragic woman.

758
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,070
我的确受过苦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have suffered. It's true.

759
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,290
不好意思  别为西蒙娜难过了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I'm sorry, do not shed tears for Simone.

760
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,990
她从她的情人那里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She is receiving ample comfort in the arms

761
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,270
得到了足够的慰藉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}of her lover

762
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,510
也就是汤米·哈特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy Harte.

763
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,390
什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What the fuck?

764
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,210
闭嘴  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shut up, Karl.

765
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,630
你跟汤米上床了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're sleeping with Tommy?

766
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,110
你们可能不知道  他才刚刚18岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who, for the newcomers, is all of 18 years of age.

767
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,850
我的老天爷啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, sweet suffering Jesus.

768
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,170
英国同性恋  青少年情人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}British homos, teen lovers?

769
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,820
这是要结什么鬼亲家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What kind of spangled hell pit are you marrying into?

770
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,380
我找到爽身粉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Found the talcum powder.

771
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,570
为什么大家都这么严肃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why is everyone so serious?

772
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,160
我从来没想到有一天我的家里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I never thought I'd see the day our family

773
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,300
会有一个同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}would have a homosexual in it.

774
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,830
布拉德  你发誓不会说出去的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Brad, you swore you wouldn't tell.

775
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,610
不  佩蒂  佩蒂  我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, Patty, Patty, I-I...

776
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,260
我不知道布拉德跟你说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I don't know what Brad told you,

777
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,920
但是我对你的感情是姐妹情  不是姬情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but my feelings for you are sisterly, not sexual.

778
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,520
我的天老爷啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, sweet suffering Jesus.

779
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,510
佩蒂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Patty!

780
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,810
回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, come back!

781
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,310
亲爱的  这一定不是真的吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sweet baby, please say it's not true.

782
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,070
她是同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's a lesbian.

783
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,030
我怎么会没看出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How did I miss that?

784
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,310
有人要来一杯餐后鸡尾酒吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anybody want an after-dinner cocktail?

785
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,160
我就不了  我现在头很疼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, not me. I have the worst headache.

786
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,900
那你去楼上躺着吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't you go on upstairs and lie down?

787
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,720
我们今晚就不打扰你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can give you a little space tonight.

788
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,810
那太好了  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That'd be nice. Thank you.

789
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,040
我要来杯苏格兰威士忌  你要吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna have me a scotch. You want one?

790
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,130
洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade?

791
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,500
你为什么不告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could you not tell me?

792
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,760
我不知道你指的是什么...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure I know what you're talking...

793
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,330
那些药  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The pills, Eli.

794
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,580
你有毒瘾还接受了我给你的药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're an addict and you let me give you pills.

795
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,950
我去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit.

796
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,060
-你是怎么...  -泰勒告诉我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- How did you... - Taylor told me.

797
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,870
晚餐的时候在卫生间告诉我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At dinner, in the bathroom.

798
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,210
我去  她...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit. She d--

799
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,260
但她不知道我吃过什么吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she doesn't know that I took anything, though, right?

800
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,110
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

801
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,030
-谢天谢地  -还不知道罢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, thank Christ. - Not yet.

802
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,540
不  不  不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

803
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,000
你这"不"是什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you mean, "No"?

804
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,730
我必须告诉她  这是件大事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have to. This is too big.

805
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,720
我去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fuck.

806
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,490
我该怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What am I gonna do?

807
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,920
她已经开始质疑我们目前的生活状况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, she's already questioning our living arrangement.

808
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,980
如果她发现了的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If she finds out about this,

809
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,750
不管她还对我还有什么感觉  我肯定要被赶出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it doesn't matter how she feels about me. I am out on the street.

810
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,730
我无处可去  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't have anywhere to go, Eli.

811
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,220
薇珞和米莎走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And Willow and Mischa are gone

812
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,300
但杜克还在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and Duke is still out there.

813
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,550
听着  洁德  洁德  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Listen. And I...Jade, Jade, listen-listen to me.

814
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,020
不会这样的  我不会让事情变成这样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's not gonna happen. Okay? I'm not gonna let that happen.

815
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,440
-我需要你在这里  -为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I need you here. - Why?

816
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,510
我是你的灵感女神还是你的毒贩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I'm your muse or am I, am I just your dealer?

817
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,620
我已经戒掉了  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm-I'm done with the pills. Okay?

818
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,470
戒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Done.

819
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,130
她不需要知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So she doesn't need to know.

820
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,430
如果是那样的话  那还给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In that case, give them to me.

821
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,170
-什么  -如果你戒了的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - If you're done with them,

822
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,390
就没有理由不把它们还回来了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then there's no reason that you can't give them back.

823
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,680
所以呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So?

824
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,260
但是现在感兴趣的制片人之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, the thing is, one of the producers who's interested

825
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,010
-想要我改写  -我就知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- wants a rewrite.- I knew it.

826
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,200
她有一些很棒的点子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's got some really great ideas.

827
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,830
-拉马尔说如果我可以在周五之前交稿的话...  -伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Lamar says if I can turn out a draft by Friday...- Eli.

828
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,900
好的  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, fine.

829
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,790
天哪  拿走吧...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jesus, just take them....

830
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,500
我离事业东山再起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just, I'm-I'm-I'm so, I'm so, so close

831
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,110
只有一步之遥了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to getting my career back.

832
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,290
没有这些东西你也可以改写成功的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can handle a few rewrites without them.

833
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,600
是啊  我只知道我曾是个编剧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, all I know is that I used to be a writer

834
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,090
也是个瘾君子  然后我戒毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and an addict, and then I got clean,

835
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,670
突然之间  我就不再是编剧了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and all of a sudden, I wasn't a writer anymore.

836
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,300
但如果我这次做到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But if I can do this,

837
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,180
如果我可以  可以完成这个剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if I can, if I can finish this thing

838
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,520
如果我可以按时把作品交上去的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and if I can get it to them on time,

839
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,230
那我就...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then, you know, I'm...

840
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,740
我就能回归
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm back.

841
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,410
我就能再次走上巅峰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will be legit again,

842
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,400
他们就会再次信任我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they will trust me again

843
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,220
然后就会有收入了  洁德...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and the money that will follow, Jade...

844
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,950
我就可以照顾你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...I can take care of you.

845
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,820
求你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please.

846
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,000
我需要它们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need them.

847
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,760
你保证你会照顾我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you promise you'll take care of me?

848
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,410
我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I promise.

849
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,820
我们去忙你的剧本吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's get to work on your movie.

850
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,220
天  今晚真是"惊喜不断"啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Christ, what an evening.

851
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,690
我累死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm exhausted.

852
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,050
你今晚不能待在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you're not staying here tonight.

853
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,320
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that so?

854
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,910
我要你立刻收拾东西离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want you to pack your things and leave, now.

855
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,080
少来了  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, knock it off, Simone.

856
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,820
我已经够生气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm angry enough as it is.

857
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,500
你生气  我女儿也许再也不会跟我说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're angry? My daughter may never speak to me again.

858
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,380
那能怪谁呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, and whose fault is that?

859
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,090
你之前要是闭嘴而不是羞辱我就行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you'd just kept your mouth shut instead of humiliating me.

860
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,620
你把我激怒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was provoked.

861
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,840
所以无论如何你也不可能抑制住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, so there was no possible way you could suppress the impulse

862
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,320
你想破坏今晚的冲动了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to blow up the entire evening?

863
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,570
你好意思说  你随时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Says the man who couldn't stop himself

864
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,120
都想溜进男厕所去快速打一炮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}from sneaking off to the men's room for a quickie.

865
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,040
去你妈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, fuck you!

866
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,150
我一辈子都在控制自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've spent my whole damn life controlling myself,

867
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,330
隐瞒我的本质
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}hiding the central fact of my existence

868
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,140
就为了不让我家人  朋友或妻子失望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I wouldn't disappoint my family, my friends or my wife.

869
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,120
只有赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hector was the only person

870
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,270
能看清我真实的为人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who ever saw me for the man I truly am,

871
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,340
而不是那个我假装的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}not the one I was pretending to be.

872
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,060
你根本不知道他对我的意义
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have no idea what he meant to me.

873
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,590
别再浪漫化你肮脏的一时放纵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop romanticizing your grubby little fling.

874
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,840
我爱过他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I loved him!

875
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,090
他叫我跟他私奔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He asked me to run away with him.

876
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,780
但我对你许下了承诺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, but I-I had made a commitment to you,

877
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,630
所以我选择留下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I chose to stay.

878
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,950
我是你妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am your wife.

879
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,960
你没离开我难道要感激你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Am I supposed to be grateful that you didn't walk out?

880
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,920
我只希望你能从我的角度来看这事  哪怕就一次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just want you to see it from my perspective for once.

881
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,960
想想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just think

882
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,120
我为了信守我对你的誓言而失去了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about what it may have cost me to honor the vow I made to you.

883
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,080
所以不  萨蒙妮  我不指望你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So no, Simone, I do not expect you

884
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,480
感激我所做出的牺牲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to be grateful for the sacrifice I made,

885
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,910
可是你好歹承认吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but for fuck's sake, at least acknowledge it.

886
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,050
我要去睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am going to bed.

887
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,810
不去客房睡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not in the guest room.

888
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,830
我要去我们的房间  在我们的床上睡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In our room, in our bed.

889
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,910
你想在哪睡都行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You sleep where you like.

890
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,860
汤普森一家刚走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The Thompsons just left.

891
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,120
让我替他们谢谢你的热情招待
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Said to thank you for a lovely time.

892
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,740
不跟我说话了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, you're not talking to me.

893
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,150
我要说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What am I supposed to say?

894
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,030
那是个派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was a party.

895
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,550
我不会闹出什么幺蛾子的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wasn't gonna cause a scene.

896
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,900
他伤害了她  就在你面前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He hurt her, right in front of you,

897
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,500
你却袖手旁观
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you did nothing.

898
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,460
我能做什么  打他吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What was I supposed to do? Hit him?

899
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,750
我们的客人肯定会喜欢我那么做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I'm sure our guests would have loved that.

900
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,320
你本可以跟他对峙的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You could have at least confronted him.

901
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,740
让他知道那种行为是不能接受的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Reminded him that kind of behavior is unacceptable.

902
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,590
他喝了酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The guy had been drinking.

903
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,130
他肯定不是有意伤害她的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt her.

904
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,720
这不是他第一次对她动手了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is not the first time he's gotten rough with her.

905
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,810
你怎么知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do you know that?

906
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,580
她手臂上有好几处淤伤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She had several bruises on her arm.

907
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,130
所以她才在这么热的天里穿长袖
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's why she's wearing long sleeves on such a hot day.

908
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,850
如果有那么糟的话  她怎么不离开他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If it's that bad, why doesn't she leave him?

909
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,620
她能去哪  罗伯  这里吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And where would she go, Rob? Here?

910
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,630
你愿意让她睡我们家沙发吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you let her sleep on our sofa?

911
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,500
老天  贝丝·安  我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jesus, Beth Ann, I don't know.

912
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,180
万一拉尔夫在半夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what if Ralph comes banging on our door

913
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,870
来猛敲我们家门  想拖她回去呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}in the middle of the night to try to drag her back?

914
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,780
你会有种和他对抗吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you have the balls to stand up to him then?

915
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,180
别用这种语言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't use that kind of language.

916
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,860
你当然不会了  你只会像个懦夫一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course you wouldn't. You would just slink away

917
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,510
偷偷溜走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}like the coward you are!

918
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,390
够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay!

919
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,930
他不是完美丈夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's not the perfect husband.

920
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,800
轮不到我对他评头论足
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not my job to judge him!

921
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,810
你想要邻居到我们家来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you like the neighbors coming in here

922
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,890
因为你不是完美母亲而对你评头论足吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and judging you for not being the perfect mother?

923
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,850
我意思是  别管了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just saying, leave it alone.

924
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,810
我不知道你还在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't know you were still here.

925
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,670
我刚在楼上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was just upstairs.

926
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,890
收拾垃圾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just... picking up some trash.

927
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,780
所以你都听到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you heard everything?

928
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,770
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

929
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,400
你们在吵什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What was that all about?

930
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,030
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey.

931
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,730
没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's okay.

932
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,200
你可以跟我说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can talk to me.

933
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,110
不管是什么  我不会评判你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Whatever it is, I don't judge.

934
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,100
我们的女儿因我而死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our daughter died because of me.

935
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,070
闯祸的是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm the one who's responsible.

936
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,140
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone.

937
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,970
你来干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing here?

938
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,170
我得知道  你爱他吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to know. Do you love him?

939
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,700
爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do.

940
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,400
那就邀请我进屋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, then invite me in.

941
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,240
我们有很多要谈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have a lot to talk about.
