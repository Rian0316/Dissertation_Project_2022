1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,682
Ooh, look pretty sharp tonight, Earl.
You going somewhere special?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,488
Max, I'm free, black and 75.
Who knows what the night will bring?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,681
Well, here's a 20.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,446
Can you break this the way
you just broke my heart?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,728
Pop, pop! Ha, ha!

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,680
Look at all this.
People really tipped well tonight.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,241
Don't get used to it.
Thanksgiving is almost here.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,722
Soon as people realize how much
they have to spend on holiday gifts...

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,764
...their wallets snap tighter
than Kim Kardashian's legs...

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,843
...after the wedding check cleared.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,810
I always love this time of year.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,248
Spiced pumpkin lattes,
bringing my winter furs out.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,008
Then bringing my winter furs to the dry
cleaners to get the red PETA paint out.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,004
For me, it was jumping into a pile
of leaves and finding a used condom.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,124
What's up, Children of the Corn?

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,968
I will stay tonight and decorate diner for
American holiday of Thanksgiving.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,771
Wow. I'm surprised you got
the right holiday decorations.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,924
Last month you put out
Easter bunnies for Yom Kippur.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,966
So many Jewish holidays,
I cannot Wikipedia them all.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,248
What, like I don't got a life?

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,644
My father and I had a special
Thanksgiving tradition every year.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,282
Let me guess. You'd fly someplace
like the Bahamas, lay by the pool...

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,051
...and he'd light other people's
stolen money on fire?

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,966
No. We'd rent out the Waldorf Astoria
ballrooms and feed the homeless.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,887
Don't look at me right now.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,169
And after, we'd fly down to our home
in St. Barts for two weeks.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,448
Okay, you can look at me again.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,171
I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria once.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,526
Beautiful hotel.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,170
Fifty dollars for a hamburger.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,164
For that money, it should eat me first.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,928
Okay, ready to go?

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,842
If you'd like to do something
to honor the spirit of Thanksgiving...

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,843
...open your doors, feed the homeless.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,207
Yeah, put your money
where your cornstalk is.

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,090
- Caroline and I will work for free.
- Isn't it enough that...

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,881
...when I see them on the street, I smile
and pretend to fumble for change?

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,323
No, it isn't. You can afford
to open the diner for one night.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,245
You can't put a price tag
on those emotional rewards.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,008
Yes, I can. Eighteen dollars for 16-pound
turkey, and I will need many of them.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,969
There. Price tag.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,086
Here. I will pay for turkeys.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,890
Jeez, dude, where'd you get that?

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,886
I sell cigarettes from New Hampshire
to school kids in New York.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,284
It is a good profit.
And beautiful drive. I love the leaves.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,807
All right, I'm feeling y'all.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,450
I'll bring the pies.

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,802
My mother used to make the best
chocolate pie.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,486
She got so mad at
this white woman she worked for...

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,722
...she took this pie into the bathroom--

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,451
No, hold up, that was from The Help.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,366
I know it's not Burberry
like we're used to, but I'm telling you.

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,887
Used moving blankets
are gonna be in this year.

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,481
Who's a trendsetter?

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,360
We're really lucky November
is so warm.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,570
Another thing I'm giving thanks
for this Thanksgiving? Global warming.

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,645
I think the three remaining polar bears
would disagree.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,282
Max, it's time to teach me how to bake.

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,808
Okay, well, if we're doing that,
first I have to go get baked.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,606
I'm serious.
It's the beginning of the holiday season.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,684
With all the Christmas cupcakes
and festive gift baskets...

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,842
...you're gonna need help.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,611
Festive holiday gift baskets?

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,481
- No way. I'm not into all that crap.
- Oh, no. Are you one of those...

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,167
..."I'm too cool to believe in the wonders
of Christmas" type of bitches?

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,851
I am so many types of bitches,
I've lost count.

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,961
The only wonder of Christmas
I'm aware of is...

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,442
...I wonder how you're gonna keep
that attitude through Christmas.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,080
Why, because this is my first holiday
without any money?

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,368
Uh, yeah.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,490
Money isn't what makes
the holidays special, Max.

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,762
Uh, yeah.

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,561
The holidays are totally about money.
About spending money to buy things...

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,406
...to stuff into the giant black sucking
hole in the center of each of us...

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,450
...that reminds us life is hard
and then we die.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,680
And that's my Christmas card.

77
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,605
Max, I'm aware this holiday season
will be challenging.

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,243
Will I miss my 20-foot Christmas tree
decorated by ten gay men? Yes.

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,764
Will I miss those ten gay men outing my
cousin Steven before he was ready? No.

80
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,009
My holiday spirit is bigger
than my money. Teach me how to bake.

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,969
- We only have a couple weeks.
- Fine.

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,044
- Pour a cup of milk into the mixer.
- This will be fun.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,762
When I was little, I used to make
my father cakes in my Easy-Bake Oven.

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,804
My Easy-Bake Oven was repossessed.

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,163
So, uh, speaking of your father,
are you doing okay?

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,164
This is a hard time of year
for people who have feelings...

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,045
...and with your father in prison,
how are you doing?

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,044
I'm great. I found out
that since it's Thanksgiving...

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,720
...they're allowing me to see him
for the first time.

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,165
Well, that excitement will probably taper
off after the full-body cavity search.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,090
I don't know, I might like it.

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,210
It's been a while since
I've had any cavities searched.

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,489
All right. Pour the milk, slut.

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,884
One cup milk.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,042
- There. How's that?
- Good.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
Now into the mixer.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,762
- There. How was that?
- Uh-uh.

98
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,891
We're not playing "rich girl gets a trophy
every time she does something normal."

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,806
Just cover the bowl with the towel
so it doesn't splash out and turn it on.

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,926
- Oh, it's not plugged in.
- Oh, right.

101
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,730
No, not without the towel.

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,811
Christmas comes but once a year,
and I think it just did.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,891
Wow, high-end mixers are a lot of money.
I thought if we came to a big store...

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,407
...there'd be a lot of them
and better prices.

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,530
- We can't afford these.
- How much did you think they'd be?

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,724
I don't know.
I guess I'm not used to looking at prices.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,282
I usually just point, pout
and it's purchased.

108
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,325
I had a version of that,
only it was more like point...

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,047
...and when they look the other way,
stuff steaks down your pants and run.

110
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,601
There has to be a mixer here
we can afford.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,649
There is.

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,129
Here.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,131
A $5 spoon?
That's what we can afford?

114
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,489
Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,770
I'm used to being poor around your stuff,
but not around stuff that I want.

116
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,123
What happened to all your
"money's not important" holiday spirit?

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,489
Max, it feels like you want me
to be depressed about the holidays.

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,964
I'm just saying it's okay for you not to be
all up around me if you're not feeling it.

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,043
It's all right to let your dark side out.

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,362
Come to the dark side.

121
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,086
Oh, my God, look.
They're hiring elves.

122
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,244
Why would I go to the dark side
when I could go to Santaworld?

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,046
Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,487
Me too, as a David Sedans story...

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,165
...not as an actual real-life option.

126
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,971
If we get hired, we could use
our employee discount...

127
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,561
...to get one
of the really good cake mixers. Oh!

128
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,281
And then it'd be like it came from Santa.
Come on, Max.

129
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,601
We'd be great elves.

130
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,161
I have the holiday spirit,
you're great with kids.

131
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,484
And we're both so desperate for money,
we'll wear other people's tights.

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,167
I've been coming to this store
at Christmas since I was little.

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,210
I'd get all dressed up in my fanciest
winter coat and hat...

134
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,809
...and then stand in line to see Santa
with my hands in my muff.

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,127
And they didn't throw you out?

136
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,520
There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,925
The place Santa sends promiscuous
elves to get the results of their STD test.

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,768
That kind of comment almost got us
knocked out of the first round.

139
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,288
- You're lucky I edited your application.
- Why? What was so bad?

140
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,762
You requested to work in Santa's
sex-toy shop.

141
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,485
Max, that's not even a thing.

142
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
Tell that to my candy-cane
shaped vibrator.

143
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,248
Max.

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,244
I call it "Santa's big helper."
Heh-heh.

145
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Please try
and get into the holiday spirit.

146
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,291
I know. If we get hired, we'll go right
home and watch Miracle on 34th Street.

147
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,209
It'll be a miracle on 34th Street...

148
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,769
...if we make it out of the bottom
of this slave ship without elf scurvy.

149
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,604
Hi. I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle On 34th Street.

150
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,081
That's my absolute favorite
Christmas movie.

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,287
Mine too.

152
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,442
Second favorite is
It's a Wonderful Life.

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,525
- Mine too.
- I've got Schindler's List on Blu-ray.

154
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,481
- Hi, I'm Mary.
- I'm Caroline.

155
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,005
Hi. I'm Mary.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,924
It's cool. We don't need to talk.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,560
That's Max.
She's kind of a Grinch about Christmas.

158
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,529
Oh. Like my brother Patrick.

159
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,842
He's always teasing me about
loving Christmas.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,606
He calls me Mary Christmas.

161
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,087
Get it? Ha, ha!

162
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,608
It's because my name is Mary.
Ha, ha!

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,444
I can't help it,
it's my favorite time of year.

164
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,924
- Mine too.
- Yo. Disconnect before it's too late.

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,327
Don't be so cynical.

166
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,686
Especially Christmas Eve.

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,367
It's an O'Brien family tradition,
all seven of my sisters and brothers...

168
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,603
...we line up on the staircase
in our brand-new Christmas PJs...

169
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,364
...and have our picture taken.

170
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,603
- Bitch is 30.
- Max.

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,608
It's my father.

172
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,206
Hi, Daddy. You'll never guess
where I am right now.

173
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,840
Applying for a job at Santaworld.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,923
No, it's not depressing at all.

175
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,846
The man's in prison
and he thinks this is depressing.

176
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,046
Oh.

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,124
Are you sure? It's really not that far.

178
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,444
Okay, if that's what you want.

179
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,171
Call me on Thanksgiving. Love you.

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,329
He thought about it and doesn't want me
to come. He can't face...

181
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,608
-...having me see him in there.
- You okay?

182
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,364
Fine.

183
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,682
Quiet, please, people.
I have an announcement.

184
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,362
Everyone in this corridor
has been chosen to be an elf.

185
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,726
Mazel.

186
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,847
Yay, we're elves.

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,129
Report to work at 3 a.m.
the morning of Black Friday.

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,968
Ooh! This is so exciting. Ha, ha!

189
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,122
Fa la Ia la Ia
La la <i>la</i> Ia

190
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,848
Okay, well, I'll see you both then.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,490
Okay, Mary

192
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,646
Great, 3 a.m.
You, me and Definitely-A-Virgin Mary.

193
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,202
Good night. Get home safely.

194
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,921
Oh. Maybe I should not
have said that to homeless.

195
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,845
That is it, 2 a.m. Freebie Thanksgiving
dinner is now officially over.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,368
According to my calculations,
we served over 300 turkey dinners...

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,443
...and only had two knife fights.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,361
Thank you, Caroline.

199
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,406
This experience taught me
that rich or poor, home or homeless...

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,284
...we are all the same.

201
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,209
Wait. Where's my wallet?

202
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,926
They took my wallet.
Those dirty sons of--

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,367
Oh, here it is.

204
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,729
Yes, we are all the same.

205
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,887
Well, I have two things to say.

206
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,080
First, I'm proud of us for spreading
the spirit of Thanksgiving together.

207
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,244
And secondly, someone left an adult
diaper in this booth...

208
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,767
...and I am not dealing with that.

209
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,490
What's with the sad face?
You saw the bathroom?

210
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,885
We fed the homeless, but it doesn't
feel like Thanksgiving without my father.

211
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,883
You made a lot of people
happy tonight.

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,408
- You should feel pretty good about that.
- Yes, I do.

213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,082
Come on, elf. Clear these tables.
We have to be at Santaworld in an hour.

214
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,561
You have to be there
in the middle of the night?

215
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,166
Because it's Black Friday.
The doors open at 5 a.m.

216
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,089
We wanna be there right on time...

217
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,965
...to see the first person trampled
to death by Uggs.

218
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,521
We work all night
and then all day tomorrow.

219
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,763
- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

220
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,843
Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

221
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,044
If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

222
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,646
- Nine-Hour Energy shots, a.k.a. Elf Juice.
- I've never done these. Do they work?

223
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,083
Millions of wired-off-their-asses
college students can't be wrong.

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,287
Whoa, whoa, wh--

225
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,284
- Did you just drink that whole thing?
- Yeah. Why?

226
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,611
Nothing. I'm sure it's not too much.

227
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,244
They suggest sipping it,
but who are they?

228
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,850
All right, we'd better go.
We gotta go, go, go.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,241
Oh, you should've sipped it.

230
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,566
How do I look? Because I kind of feel
like I look like a north pole-dancer.

231
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,803
You actually look cute. You look good
in red and green together.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,765
You can pull off anything. You're
so beautiful. I don't tell you that enough.

233
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,362
Whoa!
Whoa, slow down, Speed Racer.

234
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,126
I can't stop.
What was in that stuff you gave me?

235
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,011
I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

236
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,088
Well, my corazón
is beating muy rápido.

237
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,722
- Why aren't you in your elf costume yet?
- I was talking to those people.

238
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,680
There's a slight chance, but a chance,
I could move to the strolling carolers.

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,925
Their ethnic mix is short a token blond.
And I'm blond, baby.

240
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,369
No, no. Look, forget it.

241
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,161
You got me into the underbelly of
the elf beast. You are not bailing on me.

242
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,368
Those period costumes
are so much prettier.

243
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,046
I'll knock you to Rudolph's house
if you abandon me.

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,123
We're in this together. Get your bells.

245
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,647
I didn't wanna tell you this
because it's gross.

246
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,007
The last elf who had the tights
they gave me?

247
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,131
Let's just say her little lady elf
friend visited unexpectedly.

248
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,727
Ew. Talk about a period costume.

249
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
You're right. It's disgusting.

250
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,761
I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving.

251
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,686
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I feel tired and wired at the same time.

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,730
This was an awful, awful, awful idea.

253
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,010
All right, calm down. Jeez, you're
like a Christmas crack monkey.

254
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,766
Look, we are not
going anywhere, okay?

255
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,400
You got me all elfed up
and now we need these jobs.

256
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,643
Talk to someone and tell them
why you need a new pair of tights.

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,564
I can't. It's embarrassing.

258
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,405
Look, either you ask her
or you rip out the crotch...

259
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,928
...and risk showing 6-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

260
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,607
And now I'm sad.

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,047
You. The one with the dark hair.
Come with me.

262
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,851
Where? And is there
a drug test involved?

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,765
Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

264
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,651
The other one had to leave.
Blamed menopause.

265
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,649
Menopause, please. Heh.

266
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,926
I had my uterus yanked out on my lunch
hour and I was back at my desk by 2.

267
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,010
Follow me. Oh, unless you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

268
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,006
Oh, no. You are not leaving me here
alone when I'm crashing on elf juice.

269
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,965
If I can't be a singer,
you can't be Mrs. Claus.

270
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,607
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm throwing you
under the sled, sister.

271
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,082
That extra $2 an hour will bring us
closer to the really good mixer.

272
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,730
And the way my life is going...

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,402
...this might be my only chance
to be married to a rich guy.

274
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,123
I'd double-check those tights
if I were you.

275
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,808
- Look over here.
- Look over here.

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,045
Unh. These tights suck.

277
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,486
Hi. Hi, elf. I just got assigned
to the front of the line with you.

278
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,369
Oh, crap.

279
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,204
It's me, Mary.

280
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,681
Mary Christmas. Ha, ha.

281
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,889
- Like my brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

282
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,765
Look at how cute we look, Jingles.

283
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,088
I just named you Jingles.
Heh-heh.

284
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,447
Get it? Because of all your bells.

285
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,927
Oh, listen.

286
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,569
Ah. This is my number one favorite
Christmas song. Ooh!

287
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,206
- What's your favorite?
-"Silent Night." Get it?

288
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,647
Because I want you to be silent.

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,002
What's the matter with you?

290
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,323
You're acting like an elf-hole.

291
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,571
- Oh, hello, children.
- Yeah!

292
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,884
- Who's next to see my husband, Santa?
- I am so mad at you right now.

293
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,644
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

294
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,643
Um, hold on, children.

295
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,361
Mrs. Claus is just having an issue
with one of her elf employees.

296
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,729
- What are you doing? What's wrong?
- You abandon me on Christmas...

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,487
...the day after my father abandons me
on Thanksgiving? You have balls.

298
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,804
Christmas balls, like on Santa's tree.

299
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,122
Or a Hanukkah bush.

300
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,203
Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

301
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,567
Santa is kind of handsy.

302
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,603
And you leave me here with this one...

303
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,923
...when I'm coming down the bad side
of Nine-Hour Energy Mountain?

304
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,085
I don't know what's at the bottom, but
so far, not the miracle on 34th Street.

305
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,242
- Well, elf--
- Her name is Jingles.

306
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,249
One more word, Mary. Seriously.

307
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,811
Listen, Bipolar Express...

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,048
...you need to jingle
up that mountain...

309
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,402
...because all these kids
are looking at us.

310
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,281
Hello. You got your list for Santa?

311
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,561
Yep. Got it right here.

312
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,246
Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

313
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,845
Yay! Let's go.

314
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,850
Hi. Oh, you look so pretty
in your hat and your coat.

315
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,246
Thank you very much.

316
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,243
I used to have a coat like that.

317
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,042
But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

318
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,244
Oh, you have your list for Santa?
Let's see what you want.

319
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,131
- Oh, a pretty doll.
- Had it.

320
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,760
- An Easy-Bake Oven.
- Had it.

321
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,684
- A Barbie Dreamhouse.
- Oh. Had that too.

322
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,764
Had all those things
and now I have nothing.

323
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,764
- Nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

324
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,282
Jingles, what are you doing?

325
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,761
- Tell them, Max.
- No, no, I'm not Max.

326
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,490
I'm Mrs. Claus.

327
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,844
Mrs. Beyoncé Claus.

328
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,082
And I'm married to Santa.

329
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,204
No, tell them what you told me.

330
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,443
That it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

331
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,807
I've been married for 50 years.

332
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,122
I don't even think
about holes anymore.

333
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,291
Why is she talking to children
about holes?

334
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,204
- I'll get her

335
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,725
- Caroline--
- No, Max.

336
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,962
You were right.
They should know the truth.

337
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,851
Mrs. Claus, have a little elf control.

338
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,489
Jingles, come into my little house.

339
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,802
No, Max, they should know.

340
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,045
There is no miracle on 34th Street
and it's not such a wonderful life.

341
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,961
If it were, I wouldn't be standing here
in crotchless tights in Santaworld...

342
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,640
...with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

343
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,646
- Stop it. You're gonna ruin Christmas.
- Christmas is all about money.

344
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,646
If you want stuff from Santa,
you gotta buy it, because there is no--

345
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,848
Merry Christmas.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,082
Get her out of here now.

347
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,210
And you, put your knees together.

348
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,249
Hope I didn't ruin Christmas
for all those sweet children.

349
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,847
No, you didn't. All they saw
was a crotchless elf freaking out.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,891
But Mary Christmas
will never recover.

351
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,051
They'll find her in her studio apartment
in two weeks...

352
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,202
...hung from the chimney with care.

353
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,682
This is all kind of your fault.
You told me to come to the dark side.

354
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,363
I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

355
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,249
Once I went, I couldn't get back.

356
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,121
- And chugging that elf juice didn't help.
- It wasn't just the drink.

357
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,204
Before those presents came
crashing down on me, reality did.

358
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,283
I have no money
and a father in prison...

359
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,608
...who didn't wanna see me
on Thanksgiving.

360
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,730
Yeah, well, there are a lot of people
way worse off than you.

361
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,805
Yes, your father's in prison, but at least
you have one and you know where he is.

362
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,046
And you have a home and a job.
And you have a freaking horse.

363
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,325
So happy holidays.
It is a wonderful life.

364
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,405
You're right. I am so lucky.

365
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,971
Well, since right now is the closest to
the Christmas spirit we're gonna get...

366
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,010
...Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

367
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,491
It's our new mixer.

368
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,485
We're gonna old-school it.

369
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,405
Oh, you spooned me.

370
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,163
I feel bad, I didn't get you anything.

371
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,164
Max, you got me everything.

372
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,806
Before you, I was living on a subway,
and now look.

373
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,361
I'm living near a subway.

374
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,931
So did you buy this?

375
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,923
No, it's from Santa.

376
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,488
Jingles, did you steal this?

377
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,449
Yeah. Ha, ha.

378
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,841
I grabbed it
when they were throwing us out.

379
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,201
Wow, Caroline Channing.

380
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,524
You keep this up, you won't have to ask
permission to visit your father in prison.

381
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,327
But I did give $2 of our cupcake fund
money to the Salvation Army Santa.

382
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,962
So, God bless us everyone.
It's a wonderful life.

383
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,007
It's times like this
I really miss Darth Caroline.
