- Now, what the hell was that?

168
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,080
- [laughs]
It's-it's a Dachi stance.
- [Lucy] It's from an anime.

169
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,082
- You don't know karate?
- [Lucy] It's from one
of her baby shows.

170
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,667
- [Dez] I don't even know
what the hell...
- It's a baby show.

171
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,961
- It's not a baby show.
It's anime.
- I'm sorry. I love you.

172
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,671
- It's just a dumb show
called Kaleido Star.
- [Alexa] What's it called?

173
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,297
- [Dez] That shit is weird.
- [Katie] Anime?

174
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,924
No. I mean,
what was the name of the show

175
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,427
- that you mentioned?
- Oh. Um... Uh, Kaleido Star.

176
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,388
- [Becca] What is this?
- Anime?

177
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,473
- It's, like, animation.
- [Alexa] It's
Japanese cartoons.

178
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,725
They have the really big eyes.

179
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,644
[Katie and Alexa laugh]

180
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,729
Have you seen... Wait,
have you seen Black Butler?

181
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,982
- No. No, what's that?
- Okay, that-that one's

182
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,525
my favorite. It's about this boy

183
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,194
who signs a Faustian contract
with a demon

184
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,737
to get revenge

185
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,364
on the people
who have murdered his family

186
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,158
- and then tortured him.
- That's so dark.

187
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,909
- That sounds cool.
- I think you would like it.

188
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,245
And, um... Wait,
what was your name? [chuckles]

189
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,830
- I didn't get your name.
- Uh, Katie.

190
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,415
Katie. Okay. I'm Alexa.

191
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,000
So, no,
I've heard of Kaleido Star,

192
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,251
but I haven't seen it.

193
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,711
I watched Gakuen Alice
when I was a lot younger.

194
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,962
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay, cool.

195
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,505
- Yeah.
- Like, nobody knows that one.

196
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,465
- This is crazy. [laughs]
- Hey, I don't know

197
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,967
anyone else
who's watched it, either.

198
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,969
Yeah, and, like,
all my friends think I'm, like,

199
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,429
super stupid for watching anime.

200
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,930
- Oh, really?
- But they haven't even seen,

201
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,183
like, any anime, so they can't
really judge me, you know?

202
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,767
- But, um...
- [Rainer] All right, everybody.
Let's get down

- About us hanging out
over the weekend.

226
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,334
Uh, 'cause of rehearsing the...

227
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,669
If you... If you can't,

228
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,712
- that's okay. Um...
- [Katie] Um...

229
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,547
[Tyler] I understand.

230
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,633
Um... No, uh, yeah.

231
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,051
Yeah, I would really...

232
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,970
- Really?
- I would really,
really love to.

233
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,346
- Awesome. Okay.
- Yeah.

234
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,139
Um, unless you want
to rehearse it in the lock-in,

235
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,141
- since, you know,
we're both blue.
- [chuckling] No way.

236
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,352
- That sounds awful.
- [laughs]

237
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,187
Yeah, you're right.
Um, okay, let's...

238
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,981
[Katie] She told us that she
was gonna be gone for a while,

239
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,732
but I didn't expect it
to be overnight,

240
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,317
so we came here.

241
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,987
And she'd been in this, like,
terrible car accident.

242
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,822
- What?
- It was...
It was traumatizing, really.

243
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,574
And she was there for, like,
another twoish weeks.

244
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,619
Um, but that was, like,
a really long story. I'm sorry.

245
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,288
[Alexa] No, really,
is your mom okay now?

246
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,123
- [phone buzzing]
- Oh, yeah, no,
she's totally fine.

247
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,000
Just basically made her,
like, quit her job

248
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,835
and reevaluate
her whole life, but...

249
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,546
Uh, she's in med school now,

250
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,381
and she's almost...

251
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,591
These things are so stupid.

252
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,135
Here, you can take it.
What's the combination?

253
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,929
It's, uh, 15-42-3.

254
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,848
[Alexa] You can take it.

255
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,350
It's just spam.
[chuckles]

256
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,937
Oh.

257
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,397
- What's this?
- No.

258
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,399
- [laughs]
- No, it's nothing.

259
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,484
- Is it true
you're 93% dateable?
- No. No.

260
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,320
My friend made me do this,

261
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,322
and it was not willing,
and it's...

262
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,407

talking about feelings,

263
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,451
- and you're ready
to fall in love."
- No. No.

264
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,287
- [laughs]
- No. No. No, no.
These things are so ridiculous.

265
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,122
Okay? I did one the other day

266
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,208
about how my Patronus
is a beagle.

267
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,127
- Which is ridiculous bec... No.
- Aw.

268
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,879
No, beagles are so lame.

269
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,047
- No, they're not.
- Do you ever think

270
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,298
- about beagles?
- They're so sweet.

271
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,425
- No. Well, maybe.
- [chuckles]

272
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,677
- I think my Patronus
is a dolphin.
- Ooh.

273
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,679
- Dolphin. I like that.
- Dolphins are cool.

274
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,140
Yeah, they are cool. They have,
like, superhuman emotions.

275
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,142
Did you know
that they're the only animal

276
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,394
other than humans
to have sex for pleasure?

277
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,772
- [laughs] What?
How do you know that?
- Yeah.

278
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,775
- Why do you know that? [laughs]
- I don't know. [laughs]

279
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:55,154
So have you ever dated anyone
since you're 93% dateable?

280
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,614
[laughs]

281
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,533
Uh, no. No. Have you?

282
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,703
Oh, no. I'm probably
zero percent dateable.

283
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,914
- [phone buzzes]
- Oh, that's my mom.

284
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,916
We live about five minutes away,
and she still insists

285
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,918
- on driving me everywhere.
- Yeah, mine, too.

286
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,253
We're literally,
like, four blocks away.

287
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,173
I'm on 126th and 107th Ave.

288
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,175
- I don't know if you're...
- Oh, my God.

289
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,260
- I'm on 124th and Liberty.
- I don't...

290
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,970
- That's, like, I...
- No. That's, like,
really close.

291
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,639
- Really?
- We're only, like,
a couple blocks

292
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,015
- down from each other. Yeah.
- Oh, that's really cool.

293
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,517
- Really?
- Yeah.

294
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,310
That's her. See you tomorrow.

295
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,313

00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,076

- Sorry!

298

299
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,954
- She's pretty dusty.
- [Lori] Okay, here she is.

300
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,330
Amber, just tell me
where I'm going.

301
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,249
Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry.
Class ran a little late.

302
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,418
- Left or right? Kathryn!
- [Amber] Uh...

303
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,336
Why do you have a phone
if you're not gonna

304
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,713
- answer it when I call you?
- Uh... it's a left.

305
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
Left. Thank you. Kathryn,
you could at least text me back.

306
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,634
That's the whole point of why

307
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,844
you have the thing
in the first place.

308
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,220
Uh, sorry. I was just talking

309
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,638
to Ms. Vacher about my scene.

310
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,390
[Lori] Amber, can you get,
uh, Jenna's mom

311
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,892
on the phone and tell her
we're gonna be 20 minutes late?

312
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,519
Uh, Cynthia.
Kathryn, put your seat belt on.

313
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,479
Is it a... is it a "C"
or an "S" or a... Cynthia?

314
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,481
No, no, no. "C." C-Y-N.

315
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,941
[Katie] My battery was
running a little low,

316
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,110
too, so I just didn't
want to text you. Sorry.

317
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,737
[Lori] Today is the day
that you had to be in the car,

318
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,156
and I need to hear from you.

319
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,532
- Don't forget.
- [Amber] Huh?

320
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,950
[Lori] No, no, no.
Just text her. Cynthia.

321
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,244
[Amber] Okay. Oh, I see.
Okay, there we go.

322
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,246
Okay, now what should I do?

323
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,664
[Lori] All right,
tell her, we're g...

324
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
we're gonna be 20 minutes late.

325
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,127
I mean, seriously, Kathryn, the
reason why I got you the phone

326
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,087
is so that I could be
in touch with you,

327
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,047
not so you could write
to Moush and Lucy ten times.

328
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,466
[Lori]
This is what we have.

329
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,718
- Massive rip in the top.
- Nobody is gonna notice.

330
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,136
Move.

331
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,596
[Lori] Look, this is the
sleeping bag that we've got.

332
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,014
- Katie, do not go into my room.
- Mom, I can't take that one.

333
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,682
Here. Look. It's not even

334
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,142
- that big of a rip.
- [Katie] I can't. I can't.

335
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,477
It's just this little thing
with the fuzz coming out.

336
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,145
- I can sew it for you.
- It's gross, and there's

337
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,480
- a huge rip, and it just...
- Well, I don't why

338
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,898
I'm finding out about it now
a half hour before

339
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,399
you're supposed to be
at the school that you need

340
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,817
- a brand-new sleeping bag.
- 'Cause you're never home,

341
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,277
and when you are home,
all you're doing is studying,

342
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,778
- studying, studying.
- Excuse me?! All right,
Kathryn.

343
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,863
- I don't have time for this.
- You don't care

344
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,114
about me
or what's important to me.

345
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,157
Amber, can I have
your sleeping bag, please?

346
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,325
She cannot take my sleeping bag!

347
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,202
You're gonna have
to clean all this up.

348
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,578
- Can't leave
this big mess for me.
- ...and go to Dad's,

349
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,704
I could've done this beforehand.

350
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,289
- Okay?
- Can't have my sleeping bag!

351
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,749
If you want to go
to your father's...

352
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,167
- What? Who paid for it, Amber?
- I wanted to before,

353
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,335
- but you wouldn't let me!
- Then, fine.

354
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,419
It takes an hour
to get to your father's.

355
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,795
You could go or you can miss it.

356
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,172
Ugh!

357
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,673
I thought you were just going
with Moush and Lucy.

358
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,592
- I don't know why
you need something fancy.
- Here.

359
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,596
Here. Look.
This one is newer.

360
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,224
No. That is a ginormous
Peppa Pig sleeping bag.

361
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,226
Okay, so we'll turn it
inside out.

362
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,019
All right, look,
there's nothing in here.

363
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,022
- It's purple.
- Ooh.

364
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,358
Still see the pink Peppa Pig
zipper. I'm not a nine-year-old.

365
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,776
Well, then, we'll just cover it
up, or take the thing...

366
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,277
I don't understand why
everything has to be so...

367
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,820
There's no freaking way
I'm taking that thing

368
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,322
- to the lock-in.
- Kathryn!

369
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,325
[loud, overlapping chatter]

370
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,540
- Katie!
- Hey!

371
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,916
Dude, I thought
you were freaking dead!

372
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,334
I was about to call the cops.

373
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,419
- You guys aren't playing?
- [Moush] Oh, no.

374
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,879
- Dodgeball is the worst.
- No.

375
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,381
Mr. Daniel said we're gonna play
capture the flag soon

376
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,799
- all over the entire school.
- Are you kidding me?

377
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,717
[Lucy] I'm seriously gonna
ask to switch colors

378
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,135
'cause, legit,
no one on green is athletic.

379
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,345
Like, none
of the guys do sports.

380
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,763
- Really?
- [Lucy] Yeah. They got all

381
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,682
- the athletic guys.
- Oh, but did you see Jake?

382
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,183
He had a major grow-up
over the summer.

383
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,727
[Lucy] Okay, kind of,
but just Jake. That is...

384
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,813
- No, there's also Charlie.
- Is anyone else hungry?

385
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,273
[Lucy] I... You got all the...

386
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,859
Collect all three
of the other team's flags.

387
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,612
Big rule: the second floor
is off-limits.

388
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,614
- Yes!
- Yes!

389
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,241
Can everyone say that with me?

390
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,077
[all] The second floor
is off-limits.

391
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,121
Right? So we shouldn't see
anybody running on the stairs.

392
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,832
I don't want to see
any pushing, any kicking.

393
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,458
Does everyone understand that?

394
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,252
- Robert, does everyone
understand that?
- [girl] Yes.

395
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,797
Great. Okay. So I will be
with the red team.

396
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,216
- I want all of you
to walk, not run.
- Oh.

397
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,218
- Get your flag.
- Come on!

398
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,928
- Go. Go, go, go!
- [Daniels] Yellows are with me!

399
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,263
[overlapping chatter]

400
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:53,058
[boy] Mr. Daniels!

401
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,602
The team comes in,
just it's called...

402
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,813
Uh, yeah, just make sure
part of it's open, okay?

403
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,982
Uh, stop talking about it.
Nobody look at it.

404
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,275
Everyone, over here.
Okay, come on.

405
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,735
- Shh.
- Guys, just listen up. The way

406
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,278
everyone will know
where we've hidden it is,

407
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,946
is if we just have people
standing outside the library.

408
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,657
- Yeah.
- We've got to keep
switching defenders, okay?

409
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,034
- So, maybe you two
could start? Right?
- Perfect.

410
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,535
And then, I'm gonna lead a party
to the cafeteria

411
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,953
for yellow.
Who's with me?

412
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,080
Okay. Go. Go, go.

413
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,124
There are no other places
to hide in the gym.

414
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,585
And, like, shouldn't we try
to get red anyway?

415
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,754
No. The cafeteria is
such much closer to our base.

416
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,505
- We just... We're fine, right?
- Um, no.

417
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,715
- Like, why are we gonna
get red out?
- I feel like

418
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,716
it would be better
if we got red out.

419
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,509
It would be better. Like...

420
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,846
- Oh, Moush!
- Can you just let the...
What are you do...?

421
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,058
- [boy] Watch out!
- [giggling]

422
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm faster! No, no, no.

423
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,813
No. No, it's like a tactic
I'm throwing you.

424
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,691
- [laughing]
- A tactic. I'm throwing you off

425
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,110
- by chasing you.
- Okay, okay.

426
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,363
Do you want to help me find
the yellow flag?

427
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,739
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right?

428
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,241
It could be... it could be
a shared blue-red win.

429
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,327
Yeah, we could, like,
cut it right down the middle.

430
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,120
- Brilliant.
- And we have perfect,
amazing...

431
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,748
- Cool. Let's go. Great. Great.
- Let's go.

432
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,416
[overlapping chatter]

433
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,003
[both laughing]

434
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,047
Well, there aren't any
yellow defenders in here.

435
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,924
- We have to go
where the defenders are.
- All right.

436
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,343
- Defenders!
- Defenders! Where are you?

437
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,220
- [hums] Defenders!
- Defenders!

438
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,139
- Defenders!
- Defenders!

439
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,683
Defenders.

440
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,268
[whispers] Alexa?

441
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,687
Alexa?

442
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,605
You're not supposed
to be on the stair...

443
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,024
Oh, my...

444
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,027
[whispers] Alexa?

445
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,573
Alexa?

446
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,158
Alexa, come on.

447
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,576
What are you doing?

448
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh, my God.

449
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,454
[both laugh]

450
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,872
There's no one here.
We can sit down.

451
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,417
- Behind the MPR.
- Okay. Go.

452
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,419
- This way.
- No, this is faster.
It's faster.

453
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,337
[woman] Hello?

454
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,673
Who is that?

455
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,676
[door squeaks open]

456
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,221
[door closes]

457
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,766
- [laughs]
- Shh.

458
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,853
Wait.

459
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,897
[woman] Hello? Who's up here?

460
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,239
- Okay.
- What?

461
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,117
- [panting]
- [door opens]

462
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,911
[Katie] Duck down.

463
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,413
Yeah.

464
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,416
[both panting]

465
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,003
- [shoe squeaks]
- [gasps]

466
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,463
Oh, my God.

467
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,465
- Hey. Shh.
- [footsteps approaching]

468
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,966
[door squeaks open]

469
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,718
- Shh. Shh.
- Okay.

470
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,595
[door squeaks]

471
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,305
[door closes]

472
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,474
[footsteps retreating]

473
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,227
[both panting]

474
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,190
- [groans]
- I think she's gone.

475
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,234
I think she's gone.

476
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,404
How long do you think we're
gonna have to wait in here?

477
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,240
[panting]

478
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,368
For eternity.

479
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,459
I got a detention for this once.
It was...

480
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,885
[laughs]

481
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,847
[both laughing softly]

482
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,400
Okay, come on.

483
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,778
[both giggle softly]

484
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,240
[both laugh]

485
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,282
We can't hold hands.

486
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,700
Why not?

487
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,494
[laughs] We just can't.
Don't be crazy.

488
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,745
I don't care.

489
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:45,374
Well, you're-you're crazy, too.
[laughs]

490
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,042
- [laughs]
- What?

491
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,295
[indistinct chatter]

492
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:54,007
Girls, you're late! Come on.

493
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,759

666
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,395
She's just not back
from the lock-in yet.

667
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,940
Can you come down, honey? I want
you to meet Alexa's friend!

668
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,777
[coughing]

669
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,862
- [grunts]
- Craig?

670
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,784
- Morning.
- Morning. [chuckles]

672
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,243
What's your name?

673
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm Katie.

674
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,164
Hi, Katie. I'm Alexa's dad.

675
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,791
- Nice to meet you.
- Coffee?

676
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,001
No. No coffee.
[chuckles softly]

677
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,920
Coffee's for adults.
He's kidding.

678
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,131
What'd you guys get into
and talk about at the lock-in?

679
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,051
Uh, nothing, really. Just, like,
some games, I guess, and stuff.

680
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,637
- Yeah.
- Sounds like fun. You know,

681
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,764
Alexa should be back soon.
If you want to just wait up,

682
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,015
her room is
at the top of the stairs

683
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,433
- on the left, okay?
- Okay.

684
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,602
- Uh... thanks.
- [chuckles]

685
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,147
- [Craig] You know,
Adam called me last night...
- [blender whirring]

686
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,149
[Belinda] Just let me know
if you need something to drink

687
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,985
- or-or breakfast! Whatever!
- Okay.

688
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,237
Thanks.

689
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,240
[Belinda speaking indistinctly
in distance]

690
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,289
[blender whirring in distance]

691
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,193
- [door opens]
- [Alexa] Mom!

692
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,238
- [Belinda
speaking indistinctly]
- [door closes]

693
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,831
[footsteps approaching]

694
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,886
- Hey.
- Hi.

695
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:23,928
What are you doing here?

696
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,764
I... I just...

697
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,766
I have to talk to you.

698
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,269
[Alexa] Okay.

699
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,021
[exhales] Sorry,

700
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,441
could you just, um,
close the door?

701
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,279
Thank you.

702
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,281
[door closes]

703
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,366
Okay.

704
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,082
- Listen, I'm really sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

705
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,335
- I'm the one apologizing. You
don't have to apologize, okay?
- I got us in trouble for...

706
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:58,421
I am... I'm really messed up
for what I did,

707
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,340
and I should not have said
what-what I said.

708
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,675
And I-I'm really sorry for that.
And I...

709
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,511
I-I don't want to give you,
like,

710
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,763
the wrong idea,
because I-I know I'm not gay.

711
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,974
Like, I'm 100% positive
that I'm not.

712
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,644
And-and I really don't want
to lead you on or whatever.

713
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,980
But, like, you're a Leo, right?
A-And I'm a Libra.

714
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,066
And there's, like,
zero compatibility there.

715
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,067
Those are, like,
the worst combination.

716
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,485
So it just really wouldn't work.

717
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,861
And I took this quiz,

718
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,863
and it, percentage-wise,
turns out I'm asexual.

719
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,615
- So I-I...
- Katie, you...

720
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,784
No, no. I really just don't want
to give you the wrong idea.

721
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,160
And that is...

722
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,120
what I wanted you to talk...

723
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,664
- I-I wanted to talk
to you about.
- Well, I don't...

724
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,040
- So maybe I should just,
like, go.
- I don't understand.

725
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,333
Why did you kiss me?

726
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,585
Well, I-I wasn't thinking
in that moment,

727
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,588
- and-and I wanted to, but I...
- Well, you wanted to?

728
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,675
Yeah, I wanted to,
but I just wasn't...

729
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,218
I-I wasn't really thinking
about...

730
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,511
Then that's okay.

731
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,764
If you wanted to.

732
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,311
Well, did you want to?

733
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,063
Yeah.

734
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,314
[Katie] Really?

735
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,483
Yes. [chuckles]

736
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,152
Okay.

737
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,654
Okay. [chuckles]

738
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,282
[chuckles softly]
Sorry that I'm just, like,

739
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,158
- standing here in your room,
creepily.
- [chuckles]

740
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,994
It's fine. I'm pretty sure
that my parents

741
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,912
are probably making us breakfast
right now.

742
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,997
So...

743
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,373
We usually have pancakes
every Saturday.

744
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,126
[chuckles] Um, okay. Yeah, if...

745
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,794
- if you don't mind.
- No. [chuckles]

746
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,879
- Will your parents mind?
- Nope. [chuckles]

747
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,549
Okay, yeah. I just, like,
probably have to, like,

748
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,301
call my mom or text her
really fast.

749
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,636
