1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
是, 大臣  第1季第5集

4
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,000
大白天下

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,500
这份报告我仍然不满意 汉弗莱
I am still not happywith this report, Humphrey.

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,300
好的大臣 我们很乐意为您重新起草
Then we shall be happyto redraft it for you.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
你们已经重新起草三次了     这么说不准确
You have redrafted it three times.That's not absolutely correct.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
准确 伯纳 我会数数 这是第三稿
Yes, it is, I can count.This is the third draft report.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,600
对 就是说先起草了一次
Thereforeit has been drafted once

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,700
然后重新起草了两次
and subsequentlyredrafted twice.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,700
别钻牛角尖 伯纳
Don't quibble, Bernard.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
我们很乐意起草第三次
We shall be happyto redraft a third time.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,100
还有第四次 第五次 肯定还有第六次
And a fourth and fifth.And a sixth, no doubt.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
里面说的还不是我想说的 是你想说的
And it still saywhat you want it to say.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
我只想说我想说的       您想说什么?
Not what I want it to say.What do you want it to say?

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,800
我们想要它说您想说的
We want it to saywhat you want to.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
本部门当然不想要您说您不想说的
Not anything you don'twant to.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,700
不要再绕了
Stop wittering

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,100
六周前 研究所找我们要
The Think Tank asked us

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,900
公务员过剩的证词
forourevidenceon Civil Service overmanning.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
我向公务员一字一句布置了三回
I have briefed a group of civilservants in words of one syllable

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
每次他们交来的报告都不知所云
and they've sent backan unintelligible report,

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,200
和我要他们说的刚好相反
saying the exact oppositeof what I asked them to say.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
恕我直言 大臣 如果它不知所云
With respect, how do you knowit says the opposite

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
您怎么知道刚好相反?
if it's totally unintelligible?

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
我只想说公务员系统
All I am saying isthat the Civil Service

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
严重超编 必须裁员
is grossly overmannedand must be slimmed down.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,100
正是 报告也是这个意思
Quite so.That is what the report says.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,400
才不是呢       是 就是
No, it doesn't.Yes, it does.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
才不...听好 我说的是分阶段
No, it... Look, what I'm talkingabout is a phased reduction

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
裁掉20万名公务员
in the Civil Serviceof about 200,000 people.

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,900
你到底能不能写进报告里?
Are you going to put thatin this report?

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,400
大臣 您本周末拿回去好好研究一番
If you were to takethat draft home and study it,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
也许会发现它说的正是此意
you might find that it sayswhat you want it to say.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,300
要是没有呢       那我们只能重新起草了
And if it doesn't?Then we can redraft it.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
汉弗莱 坐下
Humphrey, sit down.

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,000
我坦率地问 你能坦率回答我吗?
Will you give me a straightanswerto a straight question?

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
好吧 大臣 只要您不要求我诉诸
Oh, well, Minister, as long asyou are not asking me to resort

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,900
简单粗拙或者大而化之的概括
to crude generalizationsand vulgar over simplifications,

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
比如"是"或"不是" 我将尽全力服从
such as a simple yes ornoI shall do my utmost to oblige.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,700
意思是"是"?
Is that "yes"?

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,100
是       好
Yes.        Right.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
问题来了       我以为刚才那个就是
Here is the straight question.I thought thatwas it.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
你给研究所的证词 会不会支持我的观点
When you give your evidence,are you going to support my view

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,000
说公务员严重超编?
that the Civil Serviceis overmanned ornot?

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,100
是或不是
Yes orno

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,000
讲明白
Straight answer

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
大臣 您一定要我坦率地讲
If you ask mefora straight answer

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
我只能说 就目前情况
then I shall say that,as far as we can see,

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,500
综观全局 纵览古今
looking at it by and large,taking one time with another,

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
考虑各部门平均水平
in terms of the averageof departments,

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,300
分析总结 也许可以认为
then in the final analysisit is probably true to say

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,900
综上所述 概括说来
that at the end of the day,in general terms,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,800
您很可能发现
you would probablyfind that

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
尽管也许不中听
not to put too fine a point on it,

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,900
无论如何 恐怕前景微妙
there probably wasn't very muchin it one way or the other.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,200
现阶段只能如此预期
As far as one can see...at this stage.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
到底"是"还是"不是"?
Is that "yes"? Or"no"?

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
是也不是
Yes and no.

60
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
如果不要你坦率回答呢?
Suppose you weren't askedfora straight answer?

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
那我会尽量争取时间 大臣
Then I should play for time.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
汉弗莱爵士
Sir Humphrey.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
啊 伯纳 请坐       谢谢
Ah, Bernard, do sit down.Thank you.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
你能来太好了       我很荣幸
Good of you to pop in.It's my pleasure.

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,000
伯纳 你知道部里那份给
Bernard, you knowthe Department's report

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,900
中央政策评估小组的报告吗?
on the Central PolicyReview staff?

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,000
知道 汉弗莱爵士
Er, yes, Sir Humphrey.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
大臣还没还给我们
We haven't had it backfrom the Ministeryet.

69
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,500
是的 没有      为什么没有?
No, Sir.      Why not?

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,400
这个...也许您应该问大臣本人
Er... perhapsyou should ask the Minister.

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,600
不 我就问你 伯纳       是 汉弗莱爵士
No, I'm asking you, Bernard.Yes, Sir Humphrey.

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
你好像吞吞吐吐的 伯纳
You don't seem to be replying.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
是也不是 汉弗莱爵士
Yes and no, Sir Humphrey.

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
伯纳 你在搪塞我吗?       绝对没有
Are you trying to be impertinent?Oh no.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
我真想搪塞 会成功的
I would succeed if I tried.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,200
请来杯加冰威士忌       好的 先生 就一杯吗?
Scotch on the rocks, please.Yes, sir. One, sir?

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,900
对 就一杯
Yes, just one.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,000
伯纳 大臣在认真批公文吗?
Has the Ministerbeen doinghis boxes properly?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
当然 他非常尽责       那到底怎么了?
Yes, he's very conscientious.Then what's going on?

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
请您去问大臣       我问你
You should ask the Minister.I'm asking you.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
但我是大臣的私人秘书 要对他负责
But as the Minister's Secretary,I'm responsible to him.

82
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,500
没错 但你也是公务员
But you are also a public servant.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
大臣的平均任期不到11个月 伯纳
The average Minister's tenureis less than eleven months,

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,400
你可要干到65岁 对吗?
but yourcareerwill lastuntil you're 65, won't it?

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,300
对 我希望能       我也希望 伯纳
I hope so. Yes.So do I, Bernard.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
不过 你自己拿主意
However, the choice is yours.

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,800
呃 汉弗莱爵士
Er, Sir Humphrey...

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
能否请教一个假设的问题?
Can I ask youa hypothetical question?

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,800
这总是个好办法
That's always a good idea.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,400
好 如果有位大臣 一位完全假设的大臣
Well, suppose a Minister,a purely hypothetical Minister,

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,100
不满意本部门
were to be unhappywith a department draft

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
对某委员会的证词草案
of evidence to a committee.

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
如果这名大臣企图
And suppose that Ministerwere planning to replace it

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
自己重写 只参谋政治顾问
with his own draftworked outwith his political adviser

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
和他的政党...       我真不敢相信
and his party...I can't believe it.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
不不 这纯粹是假设
Oh, no, no.It's purely hypothetical.

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,800
如果这位大臣打算
And suppose that Ministerwere planning to bring in

98
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,200
拖延交稿 让部里没有
his own draft so close to the finaldate that there won't be any...

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,200
不会     不会
Wouldn't...Wouldn't

100
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
让部里不会有时间重新起草
be any time forthe Departmentto redraft it forhim.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,700
怎样?
Well?

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
如果这位假设大臣的首席私人秘书
Suppose this hypothetical Minister'sPrincipal Private Secretary

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
知道了这份
were to be aware of this

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,100
假设的文件 当然是作为机密
hypothetical draft,in confidence of course,

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,700
他该不该透露给这个假设部门的
should he pass on this informationto the Permanent Secretary

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
常任秘书?
of this hypothetical department?

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,100
当然不该 伯纳
Certainly not, Bernard.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,300
既然这名首席私人秘书得到的
Not if this Principal Private Secretaryhad been given

109
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
属于机密信息
the information in confidence.

110
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,000
我也是这么想的 汉弗莱爵士
That's what I thought,Sir Humphrey.

111
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
来一杯 伯纳?
Have a drink, Bernard.

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,000
还有件事 大臣
One more thing, Minister.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,700
给中央政策评估小组的报告
The evidence to the CentralPolicy Review Staff.

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
你说研究所?       对 大臣
You mean the Think Tank?Yes, Minister.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,900
怎样?       您是不是重新起草了您草案的草案?
Have you redraftedthe redraft of yourdraft?

116
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
你不是要拿回去吧?       正是
You don'twant it yet, do you?Yes.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,300
为什么?       好为您重新起草
Why?So thatwe can redraft it.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
没有必要       我认为有 大臣
Thatwon't be necessary.I think itwill.

119
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,200
汉弗莱 起草文件不是公务员的特权 知道吗?
Drafting is not a Civil Servicemonopoly, you know?

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
不 这是门艰深的技艺
No, it's a highlyspecialised skill

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
非公务员很难掌握
which few outsidethe Service can master.

122
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,300
胡说 起草最容易了
Nonsense.Drafts is easy.

123
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,000
人人都能玩一把
It's a game anyone can play.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
想不被玩进去就难了
Notwithout getting huffed.

125
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
能否请您把草案还给我?
So could I havethe draft proposal, please?

126
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
没问题 汉弗莱
Certainly, Humphrey.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
什么时候 大臣?       过一阵 汉弗莱
When, Minister?          Later, Humphrey.

128
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
对 但是具体什么时候?
Yes, but when?

129
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,700
你总说做事不能操之过急
You always saywe musn't rush things.

130
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,300
大臣 我必须请您坦率答复
I must ask youfora straight answer.

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
哪天?明天?周一?周二?
On what day? Tomorrow?Monday? Tuesday?

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,400
适当的时候 汉弗莱
In due course, Humphrey.

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
等机会来临
At the appropriate juncture.

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,700
万事俱备
In the fullness of time.

135
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,000
条件成熟
When the moment is ripe.

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
所有必要程序都走完
When the necessary procedureshave been completed.

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
当然不会贸然给你
Nothing precipitate, of course.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
大臣 这事很紧急
Minister, this is getting urgent.

139
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
紧急 汉弗莱?今天新词不少么
Urgent, Humphrey?What a lot ot newwords

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
大臣 请恕我冒昧
You'll forgive me if I say this,

141
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,200
但我开始怀疑
but I am beginning to suspect

142
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
您对我隐瞒了什么
that you are concealingsomething from me.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,100
我们两个之间当然没有秘密 对吗?
You and I have no secretsfrom each other, have we?

144
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
抱歉 大臣 但有时人不得不想到
I'm sorry, but sometimesone is forced to consider

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
事情可能受到操纵
the possibility that affairsare being conducted in a way

146
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
考虑一切情况 前思后想
whichallthingsbeingconsidered,andmakingallpossible allowances

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,100
尽管可能比较刺耳
is, not to put too finea point on it,

148
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,100
也许您不完全坦率
perhaps not entirely straightforward.

149
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,000
坦率不坦率你最懂了
You're the experton straightforwardness.

150
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,600
那给政策评估小组的草案怎么说?
So what aboutthe draft evidence?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
好吧 既然你问了 汉弗莱 还问的这么坦率
since you ask, Humphrey,and to be perfectly straightforward,

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
我自己重新起草了一遍
I have redrafted it myself.

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
我不要你再改
I don'twant you to redraft it.

154
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,300
我非常喜欢它现在的样子
I'm perfectly happywith it as it is.

155
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
我能否斗胆问句您写了什么?
May I be bold enoughto ask what you have said?

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,700
就是我想说的 分阶段裁减公务员      对 可是...
What I wanted: Phasedreductions in the Civil Service.

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
汉弗莱 你挫败了我的透明政府
You have frustrated meoveropen government,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,400
挫败了我的节约运动 这次我可志在必得
and the economy drive,this time I'm going to have my way.

159
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,500
政党需要它 公众也需要
The party wants it,the public wants it.

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,800
我不得不说 公务员只会采取拖延战术
And all we get from the CivilService is delaying tactics.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,900
公务员的拖延不能叫"战术" 大臣
I wouldn't call Civil Servicedelays "tactics", Minister,

162
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,900
这是把消极当积极
thatwould be to mistakelethargy for strategy.

163
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,300
很好笑 汉弗莱
Very droll.

164
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,000
但你必须了解 改革是当务之急
But there is a real desirefor radical reform in the air.

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,800
党派联席特别行政委员会
The Select Committeeon Administrative Affairs,

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
由我建立 非常之成功
which I founded,it's a great success.

167
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,500
哦 是吗 有什么成就?
Oh, indeed,what has it achieved?

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
眼下没有 不过我们党派很喜欢
Nothing yet.But the party's very pleased with it.

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,500
为什么?
Why?

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
首先 上周一《每日邮报》10寸的专栏
Ten column inchesin last Monday's Daily Mail.

171
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
如今政府以专栏长度论成败啦?
The government measuresits success in column inches?

172
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
是...不是...
Yes... no...

173
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
是也不是
Yes and no

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,700
大臣 您要提交的证词
Minister, the evidencethat you are proposing to submit

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,000
不仅不真实 更有甚者 还不明智
is not only untrue, it is also,which is much more serious, unwise.

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
这件事我们讨论过
Now, we have beenthrough all this before.

177
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
公务员编制庞大
The expansionof the Civil Service

178
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
是议会立法的结果
is the resultof parliamentary legislation,

179
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
与官僚帝国无关
not bureaucratic empire building.

180
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
就是说下次质询 你要我告诉议会
So you want me to tellParliament that it's theirfault

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
是他们害公务员队伍这么庞大?
that the Civil Service is too big?

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,900
可这是事实 大臣       我不要事实
But it's the truth.I don'twant the truth.

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
我要给议会一个交待
I want somethingI can tell Parliament.

184
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,100
汉弗莱 你是我的常任秘书 应该执行我的政策
Humphrey, you are supposedto enact my policies.

185
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,900
可我不明白 你怎么专门跟我作对
Yet, you seem implacablyopposed to them.

186
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,300
我必须知道你站在那边
I must knowwhereyou stand on all this.

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
大臣 一个人站的立场 取决于他坐的位置
Where one stands, Minister,depends upon where one sits.

188
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
我猜你是不支持我了?
Am I to inferthat you will not support me?

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,700
我们永远支持您 大臣
We will always support you,

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
但要给您扛旗 而不是抬棺材
but as your standard bearernot as you pall bearer.

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
汉弗莱 你在说什么呀?
What are you saying?

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,100
我认为再清楚不过了 大臣
I should have thoughtis crystal clear.

193
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
不要把报告交给
Do not send this report to a body

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,700
打算发表它的人
whose recommendationsare to be published

195
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
我就是要拿去发表
That is exactlywhy I'm sending it.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
我不想再听你说了
I don'twant to hearany more.

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,100
我能否再说一件事?       拜托用人话说
May I say just one more thing?Lf it's in plain English.

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
很好 大臣
Very well, Minister.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
如果您非要做这件蠢事
If you are going to dothis damn silly thing,

200
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,900
拜托别用这种蠢办法
don't do itin this damn silly way.

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,300
大臣 内阁会议您要迟到了
Minister,you'll be late forCabinet.

202
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
哦 对了 内阁
Oh, yes. Cabinet.

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
今天上午讨论什么?
What are we talking about?

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
内阁讨论您的提案 关闭土地局
Yourproposals to close downthe Land Registry.

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,700
我的提案?
My proposal...?

206
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,150
您记得吗 缩减地方自治政府
Reducing the autonomousGovernment Departments.

207
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,100
是你的提案       您签字了
Itwas yourproposal.You have initialled it.

208
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,600
哦 是吗?写的什么?       放心 大臣 绝对一致通过
Oh, have I? What's in it?It'll all go through on the nod.

209
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
好吧 东西带齐了?       齐了
Got all the stuff?         Yes.

210
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,900
快点 可别迟到
Come on then,mustn't be late.

211
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100
小汉
Humpy...

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
你们部给研究所的证词写了吗?
Have you written yourevidenceto the Think Tank yet?

213
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
多少算吧       怎么讲?
More or less.What do you mean?

214
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
大臣在写       小汉
The Minister's written it.Humpy

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
对对 很不明智 可他一定要写
Yes, I know. All very unwise.But he insisted.

216
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
他一个多星期就没干别的
He's been working at nothing elseformore than a week now.

217
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,300
你不该让大臣卷进这么深
You should never let Ministersget so deeply involved.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
今天写草案 再不盯紧 他们要定政策了呢
The next thing you knowthey'll be dictating policy.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
是 我明白
Yes, I know.

220
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
这次会议长吗?       估计不会
Is this a lengthy Cabinet?I don't think so.

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,900
纯粹浪费生命
Ghastly waste of time.

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
没错 可没有我们牵着小手
Yes, but if we're not hereto hold theirhands,

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
天晓得他们会干出什么来?
God knowswhat they might not get up to?

224
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,800
失陪了 巨人 是 大臣
Excuse me, Jumbo.Yes, Minister?

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,900
你知道我提议内阁关闭土地局吗?      知道
I'm recommending to Cabinetto close down the Land Registry.

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
为什么?       为什么?
Why?             Why?

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
为什么关闭还是为什么提上内阁?
Why are we closing itorbringing it to Cabinet?

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,100
什么?       什么?
What?           What?

229
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,100
我为什么要提上内阁?
Why am I recommending it?

230
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
您当然知道       不知道我才问
Surely you know.No, that's why I'm asking.

231
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,200
你说会一致通过 我才提的
You said itwould gothrough on the nod,

232
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
现在首相问起来了
now the PM's startedasking questions.

233
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
我自己还没读过
And I haven't read my proposal.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,600
因为地方政府部门扩张了9.75%
There was a 9.75 rise in autonomousGovernment Departments.

235
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,500
对对 谢谢你
Yes, of course. Thank you.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
抱歉 巨人
I'm sorry, Jumbo...

237
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,100
你们在限制地方自治政府?
Helping to restrictthe autonomous departments?

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
正好跟首相的政策走
That should find favourwith the PM policy-wise.

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,900
哦?为什么?
Oh? Why?

240
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
最近时兴削减公务员
Veryfashionable simplifyingthe Civil Service

241
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
特别是研究所出报告之后
especially with this Think Tankrecommendation.

242
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,500
报告还没提交吧       提交了 私下的
But they haven't reported.Yes, they have, unofficially...

243
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,600
不会 证词还没收集全呢
They haven't takenall the evidence yet.

244
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
中央政策评估小组高贵的头脑
The Central Policy Review Staffdon't sully their elevated minds

245
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
掺不进证据这种沙子
with anything as sordid as evidence.

246
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
估计他们正建议首相
You may take it thatthey'll be advising the PM

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
简化政府行政部门呢
to simplify the administrationof government.

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,800
那我有得忙了 对吧
Well, that'll keep me busy.Ah, well.

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
我估计不会
I shouldn't count on it.

250
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
你不指望我－首相的资深政策顾问
You surely don't expect me,the PM's Senior Policy Adviser,

251
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
把机密透给一个常任秘书吧
to betray confidences.

252
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
当然 透机密怎么能找同事
Not to yourcolleagues, certainly.

253
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,000
反正午饭前你也会听到小道消息
No doubt the grapevinewould inform you by lunchtime.

254
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,200
听到?听到什么?
Inform?Inform us of what?

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
汉弗莱 你那位大臣千方百计
Your Minister is seeking

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,700
裁减公务员队伍
to reduce overmanningin the Civil Service.

257
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,500
这回他大功告成了
Well, he's going to get his way.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
财政部 内政部和公务员系统
Treasury, the Home Officeand the Civil Service

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
都提议
have all proposed 

260
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,000
废除你们行政事务部
to abolishyourDepartment of Administrative Affairs

261
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
首相对提案微笑了
and the PM is smiling on the plan.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
真荒唐       干净利落
That's absurd.Clean. Dramatic.

263
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
众望所归 没什么阻力
Very popularpolitically.No real inconvenience.

264
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,000
你们所有的职能都将由其他部门接手
All yourfunctions could besubsumed by otherdepartments.

265
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,200
吉姆・哈克大公无私 牺牲自己
Jim Hackerwill win throughwith a self sacrificing policy.

266
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
首相大概会把他踢到上院 供起来
The PM will probablykick him upstairs.

267
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
神风敢死队哈克阁下
Lord Hackerof Kamikaze.

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,800
丹尼尔 这一点都不好笑
I hardly think that's funny,Daniel or likely.

269
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,100
怎么?他领导过反首相运动吧
Why not? He ran the leadershipcampaign against the PM.

270
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
这可是首相精彩的一笔 一条龙服务
This could be the PM's masterstrokein one fell swoop.

271
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,700
先招安 再封爵 最后架空
Approbation, elevationand castration.

272
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
你知道首相的座右铭
You know the PM's motto

273
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,700
"败则怀恨在心 胜则反攻倒算"
"In Defeat, malice.In Victory, revenge".

274
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
废除我的部门
Abolish my Department.

275
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,600
想都不要想
Out of the question.

276
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
绝对做不到
Simply can't be done.

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
你当然最清楚 汉弗莱
I'm sure you knowbest.

278
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,600
顺便 马贩街有个就业中心
By the way, there's a job centrein the Horse ferry Road.

279
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
19路公交 下车即到
The No. 19 Busstops right outside.

280
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
我太震惊了       您还震惊
I'm appalled.You're appalled?

281
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,700
我才震惊呢
I'm appalled.

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,700
真不敢相信 我...太震惊了
I just can't believe it.I'm... I'm appalled.

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,300
伯纳 你怎么想?       我震惊了
What do you make of it?I'm appalled, Minister.

284
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
我也是 震惊啊
So am I. Appalled

285
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
实在是让人震惊
It's appalling.

286
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
震惊...
Appalling.

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
我简直没法形容
I just don't knowhow to describe it.

288
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
震惊了?      震惊了 可这是真的吗?
Appalling.But I mean is it true?

289
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
他不是吓唬你吧?
Sure he wasn't having you on?

290
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,400
一个部门怎能说废就废
They can't abolishthis entire department.

291
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,800
听起来很像真的 对吧?
It rings true, doesn't it?

292
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,400
我刚看到了各部门联合提案
I've just see the jointdepartmental proposal.

293
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,500
白厅里最不缺提案
Whitehall's full of proposals.

294
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,800
丹尼尔・休斯是首相的亲信

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,700
会发生什么?我会去哪呢?

296

有个传闻 大臣

工业协调总管大臣

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,900
工业协调?
Industrial harmony?

300
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,200
你知道这是管什么 罢工啊
You knowwhat that means.That means strikes

301
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,500
今后全英国的罢工都是我的错
Every strike in Great Britainwill be myfault.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,400
那太好了
Oh, marvellous.

303
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
您想过我会怎样吗?
Have you consideredwhat might happen to me?

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,000
没 怎样?       八成会调到农渔部去

305
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,600
余生都用来讨论鳕鱼配额
The rest of my career dedicatedto arguing about the cod quota.

306
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,100
至于你 伯纳
And as foryou, Bernard,

307
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
你的大臣落了地 你现在的好名声
if your Ministerbites the dustyourreputation as a high flyer

308
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,700
也全打水漂
will be hit for six.

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,600
你余生大概都要
You'll spend yourcareer

310
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,500
呆在斯旺西(威尔士南郊)的交通管理中心
in the Vehicle Licensing Centrein Swansea.

311
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,300
都是你的错       我的错
It's yourfault.         Myfault?

312
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,500
是你提议削减地方自治部门
Itwas yourproposal to reducethe autonomous departments.

313
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,300
是您提议分阶段削减公务员
You proposed phased reductionsof the Civil Service.

314
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,000
我们还是别吵了 想想现在怎么办?
Don't let's argue about that.What are we going to do?

315
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
我们可以上书
We could put a paperup.

316
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,900
往哪上?
Up what?

317
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
太妙了       大臣 您倒说一个?
BrilliantHave you any suggestions?

318
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
我不知道 我...       震惊了?
I don't know, I'm...Appalled?

319
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,300
大臣 这次我们真的要齐心协力
I do think thatwe should worktogetheron this.

320
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
这话我听过       什么意思?
I've heard that before.What do you mean?

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
你所谓齐心协力 就是你出主意我出力
You telling me what to do,me doing it.

322
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
不是的 大臣       你也没办法?
That isn't true.You've no suggestions?

323
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,100
我提议让伯纳叫你的政治顾问来
Bernard could fetchyour Political Adviser.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
弗兰克?你要我请教弗兰克?       是的拜托 大臣
You want me to consult Frank?Yes, Minister.

325
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
还有 大臣 恕我直言...
And Minister, with respect...

326
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,100
别跟我说这个 汉弗莱
Don't use that language to me,Humphrey.

327
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,000
说什么?       我知道什么叫"恕我直言"  
What language?I knowwhat "with respect" means.

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,300
你在暗示我的建议全都不值一提
That anything I suggestis beneath contempt.

329
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,900
啊 大臣
Ah, Minister.

330
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,400
这次我是真想齐心协力
I really do meanthatwe should work together.

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
我需要您       你说真的?
I need you.Do you mean that?

332
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,000
是 大臣       汉弗莱 你太好了
Yes, Minister.Humphrey, how very nice of you.

333
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,500
大臣 如果首相要搞阴谋
Minister, if the Prime Ministeris behind a scheme,

334
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,400
光凭白厅制止不了
Whitehall on its owncannot block it.

335
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
内阁大臣的阴谋很容易制止...重新起草
Cabinet Ministers' schemesare easily blocked... redrafted,

336
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
但首相就另当别论
but the Prime Ministeris anothermatter.

337
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
我们得从议会和白厅两面出击
We need to fight thisin Westminsterand in Whitehall.

338
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,100
弗兰克・埃瑟尔动员后座议员
And Weisel might be ableto mobilise the backbenchers.

339
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
对对 媒体呢 他也许还能发动媒体
Yes. And he might be ableto mobilise the Press.

340
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,500
弗兰克 你听到消息了?       伯纳刚告诉我
You've heard the news?Bernard just told me.

341
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,200
有什么建议?
What do you suggest?

342
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,600
我想不出来...我震惊了
I can't think of anything...I'm appalled.

343
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
我们不能跟老母鸡似的自乱阵脚
Mustn't all flap aroundlike a lot of wet hens.

344
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
得设法拯救这个部门
We've got to savethis Department.

345
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,400
听好 你找组织秘书动员后座议员
I want you to getto the backbenchers

346
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
趁它出世之前消灭掉
to put a stop to this thingbefore it starts.

347
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,800
对不起 大臣 可是没出世的东西消灭不着
I'm sorry, but you can't stopsomething before it starts.

348
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,400
多谢了伯纳 弗兰克...
Thank you. Frank...

349
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,300
没那么容易 吉姆 后座议员非常欢迎这计划
Itwon't be that easy.Itwill be a very popularmove.

350
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,300
发动舆论呢?大臣 您知道:
A publicity campaign?You know:

351
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
"行政救国" "公文之乐"
"Administration Saves the Nation""Red Tape is Fun".

352
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,000
整版广告登在...
Full page ads in...

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
我瞎想的
Itwas just an idea.

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
"公文之乐"?
"Red Tape is Fun"

355
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,100
"公文连起你我他"呢?
What about "Red Tape holdsthe Nation together"?

356
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,600
没办法挽回了 已经大白天下了
Well, there's no doubt about it,the writing's on the wall.

357
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,300
反正公众应该感激行政部
The public should think kindlytowards Administration,

358
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,100
解决了欧通卡的事       就是
because of the Europass.Quite.

359
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
欧通卡?       欧洲统一身份证
Europass?European Identity Card.

360
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
伯纳 你没告诉大臣?
You've informed the Minister?

361
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
大臣 您没看公文盒?
Didn't you do yourboxes?

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
没有 我在起草草案的草案呢
No, I was redraftingthe redraft of the draft.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
简单说 大臣 欧盟即将颁布
Well, Brussels is about to decree

364
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
一种新的欧洲统一身份证
that there is to be a newEuropean Identity Card

365
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,300
供欧洲共同体全体成员使用
to be carried by all citizens of the EEC

366
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
外交部已经准备妥协了
The Foreign Officeis ready to go along with it

367
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,400
补偿我们硬栽出去的黄油山
as a quid pro quo fora dealover the buttermountain,

368
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
红酒湖 牛奶海
the wine lake,and the milk ocean,

369
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
羊肉战 鳕鱼堆
the lamb war,and the cod stink.

370
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,900
很显然 首相要您来提出立法
And the Prime Ministerwants youto introduce the legislation.

371
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,200
我?       对
Me?           Yes.

372
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
众所周知您是亲欧洲派嘛
You're pro Europe, you see.

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,100
这也能大大简化行政程序
And itwould simplifyouradministration.

374
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,000
实在是好主意       好主意?
So it's a good idea.    Good idea?

375
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,100
好主意?       好主意?
Good idea?       Good idea?

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
有什么不好吗?       这是政治自杀
Not a good idea?     Political suicide

377
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,800
让英国人都带身份证?
Trying to make British peoplecarry Identification Papers?

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
他们会说这是极权国家的做法
They'll call it a Police State.

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,300
我们打了两次世界大战 就为这个?
Is this whatwe foughttwo world wars for?

380
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,200
大臣 这就跟驾驶证差不多
It's little more than a sortof driving licence.

381
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,800
这是给我落井下石
It's the last nail in my coffin.

382
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
您可以改叫它"欧洲快车"
You might get awaywith calling it "Euroclub Express".

383
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
伯纳 要么闭嘴要么出去
Bernard,eithershut up orget out

384
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
为什么是我们 不该归外交部吗?
Can't the Foreign Officeintroduce it?

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
其实 首相原本也这样想
Thatwas the Prime Minister'ssuggestion,

386
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,000
但外交部长说归内政部
but forthe Foreign Secretaryitwas a Home Office matter

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
内政部说其实
and forthe Home Officeitwas essentially

388
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,800
这是行政事务 首相同意了
and administrative matter,and the PM agreed.

389
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
都在踢皮球
Pass the parcel.

390
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
里面有定时炸弹 能怪他们吗?
Can you blame themwhen you can hear it ticking?

391
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,300
恐怕按计划 这个身份卡议案
The identity card billis planned to be

392
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,200
会是本部门的收山之作
the last actionof this Department.

393
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
反欧洲分子该高兴了
Wonderful ammunitionforthe anti Europeans.

394
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,400
外交部不知道这会分裂大欧洲吗?
Don't the Foreign Office realisethe damage to the European idea?

395
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,500
当然知道 所以要支持
That's why they support it.

396
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
外交部该亲欧洲吧?
The Foreign Office is pro Europe,isn't it?

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
是也不是...原谅我的措辞
Yes and no...if you'll forgive the expression.

398
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,700
外交部亲欧洲 实际是为了反欧洲
The Foreign Office is pro Europebecause it is really anti Europe.

399
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,900
公务员团结在这一理念下
The Civil Service was unitedin its desire to make sure

400
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,200
保证共同市场不能形成
that the Common Marketdidn'twork.

401
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,400
所以我们才打进去       你在说什么?
That's why we went into it.What are you talking about?

402
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,800
大臣 英国的外交目标
Minister, Britain has hadthe same foreign policy objective

403
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,300
500年来没有变过
forat least the last 500 years:

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
创造一个分裂的欧洲
To create a disunited Europe.

405
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,600
因此 我们联荷兰制西班牙
We have foughtwith the Dutchagainst the Spanish,

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,900
联德国制法国
with the Germansagainst the French

407
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,200
联法国和意大利制德国 联法国制德国和意大利
and with the French againstthe Germans and the Italians.

408
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,000
分而治之 您看
Divide and rule, you see.

409
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,500
一贯效果很好 为什么要改变?
Why should we change now,when it's worked so well?

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
这都是老皇历了吧?
That's all ancient history surely?

411
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
对 也是现行政策
Yes, and current policy.

412
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
我们必须打进去 从内部攻破
We had to break the whole thing up,so we had to get inside.

413
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,700
我们施加过外力 没有成效
We tried from the outside,but itwouldn'twork.

414
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,200
现在可以从里面把它搅成一锅粥了
Now, we can make a completepig's breakfast of the whole thing.

415
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,100
挑德国反法国
Set the Germansagainst the French,

416
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
挑法国反意大利 挑意大利反荷兰
the Italians against the Dutch...

417
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,800
外交部高兴坏了 光辉岁月又回来了
The Foreign Office is terriblypleased, it's just like old times.

418
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,100
但我们都忠于大欧洲理念吧
Butwe're all committedto the European ideal.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
诚然 大臣
Really, Minister.

420
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
不然为什么要增加成员国?
Why are we pressingforan increase in the membership?

421
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,100
一个道理 就像联合国
Forthe same reason.It's just like the United Nations.

422
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,800
群龙无首 人多嘴杂
The more members it has,the more arguments it can stirup,

423
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
它就越发鸡毛蒜皮
the more futileand impotent it becomes.

424
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,300
这也太刻薄了吧       是啊
What appalling cynicism.Yes.

425
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
我们一般叫做外交 大臣
We call it diplomacy, Minister.

426
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,600
别的国家会怎么看身份证?
Howwill the othercountriesfeel about identity papers?

427
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
它们没意见吗?
Won't they resist too?

428
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,700
没有 德国人正合意 法国人不在乎
The Germans will love it,the French will ignore it,

429
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,900
意大利和爱尔兰乱成一团 根本执行不下去
and the Italians and the Irishwill be too chaotic to enforce it.

430
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,900
只有英国人受罪
Only the British will resent it.

431
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,500
这是成心陷害我       反正也要废你的部
It's a plot to get rid of me.They'll abolish your Department.

432
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
也许首相要斩草除根
Perhaps the PM wantsto make absolutely certain.

433
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,300
别神经过敏       大家都要对付你 你也会神经过敏的
Don't be so paranoid.Everyone is plotting against me.

434
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,100
我们支持你 大臣       对 大臣
We're on yourside, Minister.Yes, Minister.

435
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,500
马丁会支持我们       对 马丁在哪?
Martin will be on ourside.Yes, where is Martin?

436
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,300
外交部长大概在下院 大臣 您也该去的
I think he's in the House,Minister, where you ought to be.

437
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,900
我们去找他
Let's go and see him.

438
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,900
真让人震惊 吉姆
This is appalling, Jim.

439
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
你就像参孙       参孙?
You've done a Samson act.Samson?

440
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,100
对 你一心想减少公务员 就动手了
You've reducedthe Civil Service bureaucracy.

441
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,900
摧垮整座大厦 埋葬了你自己
You've pulled the superstructuredown and buried yourself.

442
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
惨胜不如败       没办法吗?
A Pyrrhic victory.No ideas?

443
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
若能帮忙我当然尽力       不过我还不明白欧通卡...
I'd help if I could, but...But the Europass...

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
说不过去
It doesn't make sense.

445
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,900
首相看不到它会危害政府吗?
Why can't the PM seethe damage?

446
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,900
没错 欧通卡是我入内阁以来
Yes, this Europass issueis the biggest disaster

447
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
政府最大的危机
since I asked to join the Cabinet.

448
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
您当然不是这个意思 大臣
I don't think you quite mean that.

449
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
人人都知道欧通卡行不通
Everybody knowsthis Europass thing won't happen.

450
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,200
但是为了拿破仑奖  首相一定得玩到底
The PM's got to play along with itbecause of the Napoleon Prize.

451
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,900
拿破仑奖?
Napoleon Prize?

452
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,300
北约颁的 五年一次
A NATO Awardgiven once everyfive years.

453
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,500
布鲁塞尔开大会 发金奖牌 10万镑奖金
Gold medal,big ceremony in Brussels.

454
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
这次首相呼声最高
The PM's the front runnerthis time.

455
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,300
颁给对欧洲统一贡献最大的政治家

456
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
拿破仑以降 如果不算希特勒的话
Since Napoleon.That is if you don't count Hitler.

457
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
所以呢?
So? What...?

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
委员会六周后决议
The awards committeesits in six weeks.

459
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,000
首相不能最后阴沟里翻船
The PM isn't going to rockthe boat until it's in the bag.

460
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
"阴沟里不可翻船" (交通管理中心^_^)
You don't put boats in bags.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
你说什么 伯纳?       没什么 首相
What's that Bernard?Nothing, Minister.

462
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,000
一旦奖到手 首相马上推翻欧通卡
Once the prize is awarded,the PM will dump the Europasses.

463
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,800
马丁 多少人知道拿破仑奖的事?
Howmany people know aboutthe winnerof the Napoleon Prize?

464
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
这是最高机密       你是说人人都知道
It's top secret.You mean everyone.

465
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
不是 最高最高机密       就是它了
No, top secret top secret.That's it then.

466
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,000
汉弗莱 你没想到吗?       想到什么?
Humphrey, don't you see?See what?

467
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,500
后座议员 消息泄漏       威尔士民族党?
Backbenchers. Leaks.The Welsh Nationalist party?

468
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,200
不 不 不
No. No. No.

469
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
对不起 外交大臣 我过会再来
Oh, I'll come back later.

470
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,900
别 别走 正要找你
No. No.Don't go, the very man.

471
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,100
进来 丹尼尔
Come on in, Daniel.

472
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,400
我有一事请教       我尽量帮忙 大臣
I want to ask youradvice.I'll give any help I can.

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,200
但要是木已成舟的事
But if it's about shutting stabledoors afterhorses have bolted,

474
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
我也为无力挽回
even I am powerless to help.

475
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,600
这事你能出力
You won't be powerlessin this case.

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,100
完全是个道德困局
It's really a sort of moral dilemma.

477
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
假设一名后座议员
Supposing a backbencherwere to put down

478
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,200
向首相质询欧通卡的事...
a question forthe Prime Minister,asking whetherthe Europass...

479
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,600
哪个议员?欧通卡是最高机密
Which backbencher?Europass is top secret.

480
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,200
跟拿破仑奖得主一样机密吗?
You mean like the winnerof the Napoleon Prize is top secret?

481
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
我想大臣是说假设有议员
The Ministermeanta hypothetical backbencher.

482
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,200
正是 伯纳 谢谢你
Quite so, Bernard.Thank you.

483
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,100
一名假设的议员
A hypothetical backbencher.

484
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,300
对首相提了个假设的问题
And a hypothetical question

485
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,000
问英国是不是会接受欧通卡
asking whetherornot Britainwas going to adopt the Europass.

486
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
非常不可能       我同意 非常不可能
Highly improbable.Oh, I agree. Highly improbable.

487
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
但如果首相说"会"
But suppose the PMwere to answeryes,

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
会严重打击国内吧?
itwould be very damagingin the country?

489
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,300
对
Yes.

490
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,300
如果首相说"不会"
And if the PMwere to answerno

491
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,700
在欧洲又很尴尬?
itwould be very damagingin Europe?

492
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
对首相个人来说
To the PM personally.

493
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,300
拿破仑奖方向
Napoleon prizewise.

494
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
好 如果这个假设的首相预先知道了
Now, if a hypothetical Ministerwere to get to hear

495
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
这个假设的问题 他该怎么办?
of this hypothetical questionin advance, what should he do?

496
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
唯一办法是保证
The only coursewould be to ensure

497
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,900
没人会质询这个 很明显
that the questionwas not tabled.

498
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,000
压制议员质询 责任重大啊
Serious business,suppressing an MP's question.

499
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
不过 没有别的办法
There is no othercourse.

500
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,700
想拦住他 唯一办法也许是
The only way to stop himmight be to get him

501
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
消除他的另一个疑问
to put down a question askingthe Prime Minister

502
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
要首相澄清传说中
to squash the rumoursabout the closure

503
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
废除行政事务部的谣言
of the DepartmentforAdministrative Affairs.

504
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
哦 我肯定...你怎么会想到...
Oh, but I'm sure...whatevermade you think...

505
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,200
没问题 我们全力支持
anything but the fullest support...

506
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
昨天你还说废除行政部已经提上议程
You said that a plan to abolishthe Department had been put up,

507
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
首相还朝它微笑
and the PM was smiling on it.

508
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
不 是嘲笑 嘲笑 不是微笑
No, smiling at itSmiling at it, not on it.

509
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
这个主意荒谬绝伦
The whole idea was ridiculous.

510
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,700
可笑 不值一驳
Laughable.Out of the question.

511
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,500
开玩笑
Ajoke.

512
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
开玩笑?
Ajoke?

513
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,900
当然是玩笑 你不会以为...
You didn't imagine...

514
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,400
那由首相办公室出具的
So that a minute from the PrimeMinister's office confirming this,

515
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,100
澄清谣言的备忘录 会在24小时内
and squashing the rumour,will be circulated to all departments

516
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,400
下发到所有部门吧
within 24 hours.

517
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,300
让大家都看到 一起笑嘛
So thatwe can all share it,jokewise I mean

518
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,500
你真觉得有这个必要吗?
Do you really think it's necessary?

519
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
有
Yes.

520
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
好吧 肯定有办法的
Well, I'm sure somethingcan be arranged.

521
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
我先失陪
If you'll excuse me.

522
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
将死他了吧
Checkmate, I think.

523
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,500
一击中的
Game, set and match.

524
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,600
丹尼尔・休斯能做到吗?
Can Daniel Hughes fix this?

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
首相自己有想法的吧?
Don't Prime Ministershave minds of theirown?

526
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,400
当然
Certainly.

527
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,700
但正像尼克松总统的亲信说的
But as President Nixon'shenchmen once said:

528
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,300
"抓住了他们的要害
"When you've got them by the balls,

529
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,400
他们的意志和头脑就为你所制了"
theirhearts and minds will follow".

530
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,200
不是吗?
Isn't that right?

531
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
