           [Chuckling]          
        Well, thank you!        

501
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:31,205
    I'm a long-time listener    
    and a first-time caller.

504
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,544
    Oh, I see...                

505
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:38,379
                Hello, ma'am.

     [Camera shutter clicks]    

510
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:48,039
             Uh-huh.

512
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:53,060
              What's your name, 
                   honey?       

517
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:13,631
          God damn it.          

518
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,068
                 The crowd's    
           already thinning out.

519
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,919
           Apparently, the image
        on the side of the house

520
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:20,479
            has started to fade.

521
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:22,014
Tomorrow we're bringing in      
 additional security            

522
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,016
and blocking off parking.       

523
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:26,927
        Answer me this --       

524
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,338
        if they're saying       
  it's radioactive over there,  

525
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,916
      how the hell is Acker     
      still in that house?      

526
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,360
That was really more of         
 an OSHA situation.             

527
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,937
 The concern was for            
the construction crew.          

528
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:39,999
   Turns out the radiation level
            was completely safe.

529
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:43,277
  We should be cleared to resume
       construction on Thursday.

530
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,663
           Assuming nothing else
                  comes up.     

531
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:53,880
      Kim, [Clears throat]      
      bottom line me here.      

532
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:58,109
Clearly, this is all designed   
to force us back to the table   

533
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,686
and put us at a disadvantage    
 when we get there.             

534
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:03,681
[Scoffs] We've gotta get back in
the driver's seat on this thing.

535
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,118
              I say             
     we sue 'em right back.     

536
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,861
           Sue Acker.           
          Sue Goodman.          

537
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:11,138
         Take the fight         
          back to 'em.          

538
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,292
            Going down that road
              could take years. 

539
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:16,819
They know this is costing       
     Mesa Verde.                

540
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,646
       Time is                  
   on their side.               

541
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:21,157
            [Scoffs]            
       You got that right.      

542
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,561
              Rich,             
  do you have anything to add?  

543
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,563
      Possibly.                 

544
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:32,567
What if there were a way        
to turn this around on them?    

545
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:35,421
What if you don't build         
  the call center?              

546
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,998
Or not at that location,        
      at least.                 

547
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,984
Suddenly you're holding         
   all the cards.               

548
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,243
There's nothing to delay.       

549
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,095
  The other side's              
the one spending money          

550
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,223
with no hope of recovering      
   their expenses.              

551
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,250
           Wait. So...          

552
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:50,344
          [Sighs] What?         

553
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:54,014
I understand there's a viable   
  alternative site.             

554
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:57,685
You make the switch,            
   and you've won.              

555
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,336
             [Sighs]            
         Wait. Hold up.         

556
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,355
          Didn't we let         
       the other site go?       

557
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:03,115
Lot 2375 is available,          

558
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,600
   and our permits              
    still apply.                

559
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:07,178
           We'd still           
         hit our target         

560
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,014
   for getting the call center  
         up and running.        

561
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,351
       We took the liberty      
 of running the numbers for you.

562
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,588
Paige: The financial hit        
would be negligible.

             [Sighs]            

564
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:35,889
         My dad did not raise me
            to run from a fight.

565
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:37,632
       Kevin,                   
 we're not saying --            

566
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:40,119
         I'm not gonna roll over
   and let some low-life shyster

567
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:41,762
           bully me off my land.

568
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:43,406
                 No offense,    
                    Kim.

00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,411
                I got a room    
        fulla the best there is.

571
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,572
                 Here's what    
              we're gonna do -- 

572
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:54,725
   you're gonna figure out a way
    to get them off my property.

573
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,629
   That call center's not movin'
              one goddamn inch!

576
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,751
                 You gave it    
               your best shot.  

577
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,420
 Yeah?                          
               [Chuckling] Yeah.

578
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,699
           You went the distance
             for the old S.O.B.,

579
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,259
              above and beyond. 

580
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,870
            You should feel good
                 about that.    

581
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,279
    You think so?               

582

                   [Sighs]      

583
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:37,526
               You gave Acker   
          more than he deserved.

584
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:40,437
                  And, uh,      
               let's be real.   

585
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,032
           Putting me on this --
                that was bad.   

586
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:47,035
                   I mean,      
          if anyone found out...

587
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,996
              You risked a lot  
                for this guy.

00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,969
                    Look,       
            this time next week,

590
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,047
            Acker will be living
               somewhere else.  

591
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,809
               Is that really   
              such a big deal?  

592
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,386
                    Plus,       
                Mesa Verde --   

593
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:06,980
                 that's your    
              bread and butter. 

594
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,575
                You can only    
              push 'em so far.  

595
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,374
               There's always   
                another play.

597
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:26,483
          But the rational thing
   to do here is close the deal,

598
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,985
                 get the guy    
                a few bucks,    

599
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,170
              pop the champagne 
         with the other winners,

600
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:33,490
                  and smile     
              like you mean it. 

601
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,602
              You want a beer?  
             I'm gonna get one.

       Jimmy.                   

604
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:55,679
              There's no reason 
            on God's green Earth

605
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,514
                to take this    
                any further.    

606
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,250
             It's not worth it.

       Or...?                   

609
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,634
                   [Sighs]      

610
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,043
                    Or...       

611
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:13,213
                 we go after    
               Kevin Wachtell.  

612
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:15,032
               It gets nasty.   

613
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,034
              It gets personal. 

614
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,438
             It gets dangerous. 

631
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,714

                Hey. It's me.   

632
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,549
           Yes, it is.

                   Great.

00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:34,053
                 Uh, listen,    
        I got something for you.

635
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,705
             Hear me out because
           this is a good thing.

636
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,449
