1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,040
孩子们  有时候你的感情会一帆风顺
Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,260
久到你以为一辈子都会那样
that you think it will be that way forever.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,540
但那是不可能的
It never is.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,850
我们刚刚第一次吵架
Well, we just had our first fight.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,300
我们刚刚第一次吵架
We had our first fight.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,030
不会吧  你们为了什么吵?
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,980
不会吧  你们为了什么吵?
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,680
几个月前  我的建设事务所进行了 一件新大楼的设计案
A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,940
那是在斯普肯的大型摩天楼
It's this big skyscraper in Spokane.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,710
这对他的事务所来说是个大案子
It'd be a huge project for his firm.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,810
如果我们拿不到那个案子 我们可能就会倒闭
And if we don't get it, we could go under.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,850
当首席设计师在全体员工
So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,280
面前发表了他的设计
to the whole company.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
- 不会吧 - 不会吧
- No. - No.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,330
是的
Yes.

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,380
所有的摩天楼看起来都像是...
All skyscrapers kind of look like a...

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,080
马修 那是栋78层 粉红大理石的高楼
Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,660
顶上还有一个圆顶
with a rounded top

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,570
正面还有两个球形通道
and two spherical entryways at the front.

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,480
全套都齐了嘛
Wow, so it's the whole package.

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,540
- 讲得好 - 谢谢
- Yeah, you did. - Had to.

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,230
伙计  如果他们要卖公寓 你可要帮我弄一套
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,570
但不要给我柱型部分的
And don't give me the shaft.

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,420
- 讲得好 - 谢谢
- Yeah, you did. - Had to.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,720
这也太搞笑了
It's a travesty.

26
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,680
那将会是城市的空中标志物
It's gonna define the skyline of the city.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,220
如果是我的话 我肯定能设计出很棒的作品
If it was me, I could've designed something amazing.

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,230
结果我却花了12个小时 去设计飞檐
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.

29
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,990
- 讲得好 - 这个不是笑话
- Yeah, you did. - That wasn't one.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,950
老爸老妈的浪漫史 第二季 第四集

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,320
你和泰德吵了第一次架
So you and Ted had your first fight.

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,000
很明显  结局还不错 我意思是 你还能和我一起在这儿
It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.

33
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,820
事实上  我们还没吵完
Actually, it didn't end at all.

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,920
我开始生气后  就来了这里
I started getting bummed out, so I came here.

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,920
我就是这样的
It's what I do.

36
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,760
我祖母去世的时候 我去烫了头发
When my grandma died, I got a perm.

37
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,800
一天听到两个悲剧
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,140
事情是这样的 泰德已经不断抱怨
The thing is, Ted has been literally

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,570
他的工作好几个星期了
complaining about work nonstop for weeks.

40
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,080
所以我今天过去以后 真的受够了...
So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.

41
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,441
- Hey. - Hey.

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,440
- 今天怎么样? - 很好
- How was your day? - Good.

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,280
你真是个好记者
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

44
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,530
你不准备问问我的工作吗?
Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,170
不  我知道你过得很糟
No, I know how it was. It was awful.

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,480
今晚你想租部电影看看吗?
Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,120
知道吗
You know, um...

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,480
我一直都倾听你工作上的事
I listen to your work stories all the time.

49
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,080
对  但是... 我不想显得太粗鲁
Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here,

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,690
但是我的故事都很有趣
but my work stories are interesting.

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,760
我是个电视新闻记者
I'm a television news reporter.

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,840
- 罗宾 - 怎么?
- Robin... - What?

53
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,600
我清楚知道他想说的话
I knew exactly what he was going to say.

54
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,310
我只是加快他的进程
I was just helping him get there faster.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,270
你应该在自杀热线工作
You should work at a suicide hotline.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,420
然后事情就变糟了
And then it got ugly.

57
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,100
我可没有把相同的故事 一遍又一遍跟你说
What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again.

58
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,000
就像你也不会一部电影
I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie

59
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,840
重复看很多次吧
over and over again, would you?

60
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,870
除非是像 虎胆龙威 那样的好电影
Maybe a great movie like Die Hard.

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,530
但如果是  梦幻之地?
But Field of Dreams?

62
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,740
看一次都嫌够了
Once is more than enough.

63
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,840
那就是你认为的糟糕电影?
So that's your go-to bad movie?

64
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,840
你所能想到的头号 糟糕电影的例子
The number one example on the tip of your tongue

65
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,620
梦幻之地?
of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?

66
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,960
那部电影是讲什么 鬼魂棒球选手的
It's about ghost baseball players.

67
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,570
我觉得那很傻
I think it's stupid.

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,860
所以现在他为了 那部傻电影 生我的气了
So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.

69
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,630
他是因为你不听他说话而生气
Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him,

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,780
不是因为你不喜欢那部电影
not because you didn't like some movie.

71
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,990
怎么能有人不喜欢梦幻之地?
How do you not like Field of Dreams?!

72
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,710
倾听是一段感情的基础
Listening is the foundation of a relationship.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,340
如果他真的一直嘀咕
And if he's really droning on,

74
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,840
你可以练习倒着说字母表
you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards.

75
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,310
以防酒后驾车被警察逮到
You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,800
我想我不需要练习那个
I guess I don't know how to do that.

77
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,240
就算你是清醒的 那也很难
Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober.

78
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,210
我就是这么和警察解释的
That's what I tried to explain to the cop.

79
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,000
我不知道 怎么处理这种 "女朋友该做的事"
No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing.

80
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,380
我从来没有过这么认真的交往过
I've never been in a relationship this serious before.

81
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,440
我是不是应该去跟他道歉?
I  should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,040
你现在就在倒背  对吧?
You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?

83
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,620
Q前面到底是什么?
What the hell comes before "Q"?

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
电影结束的时候 他和父亲又玩了一次 接抛球
Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like...

85
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,720
就像他以前年轻 时候都没玩过一样
like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,020
我们能谈点别的吗?
Can we talk about something else?

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,830
知道吗  伙计
You know what, dude?

88
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,150
忘了罗宾吧 你今晚和我们混了
Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight.

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,030
我有个超棒的派对在等着呢
I've got an awome party lined up.

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,430
上帝啊
Oh, God.

91
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,100
又是个古怪的全男人派对吗?
This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,260
那是个扑克牌游戏 你到底有什么毛病啊?
That was a poker game. What is wrong with you?

93
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,790
不  那是今年第一个法学院派对
No, it's the first law school party of the year

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,340
那肯定会很棒
and it's gonna be awesome.

95
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,250
自从去年我和莉莉分手后
I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year

96
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,820
我已经很久没见过他们了
before Lily and I broke up.

97
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,120
所以我得向所有人 宣布这个消息
So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody.

98
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,090
那肯定会让他们伤心的
It's really gonna bum them out.

99
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,650
这个派对肯定会很糟
This party's gonna suck.

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,090
这个派对我很乐意参加
Well, love to join you at that one.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,940
但是我有性感拳击的票子
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

102
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,760
我也想和你们一起玩 但我要回去
I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back

103
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,830
完成我明显很无聊的工作
to my apparently boring job.

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,370
- 你的工作不无聊啊 - 罗宾觉得无聊
- Your job's not boring. - Robin thinks so.

105
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,710
伙计  很多美女认为建筑师很酷
Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,270
想想看  你能凭空制作东西出来
Think about it, you create something out of nothing.

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,420
这就像是上帝
You're like God.

108
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,460
没人比上帝更帅了
There's nobody hotter than God.

109
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,420
很高兴你能引用圣经
I love it when you quote Scripture.

110
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,530
我是说  你应该对女士们 使用你的建筑师魅力
I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.

111
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,790
首先  我已经有女朋友了
Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend.

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,260
再说  建筑师魅力根本对她无效
Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her.

113
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,190
第三  我不觉得那会 对任何人有效永远
And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.

114
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,550
那是因为你总是这样...
That's 'cause you're always like...

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,870
泰德・莫斯比  建筑师
Ted Mosby, architect.

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,080
如果是我  我会这样...
If it were me, I'd be like...

117
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,700
泰德・莫斯比  建筑师
Ted Mosby, architect.

118
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,930
只要说的语气对 任何东西听起来 都会印象深刻
Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.

119
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,050
马修・埃里克森
Marshall Ericksen.

120
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,750
最近刚被甩 现在正要去一个很糟的派对
Recently dumped and heading to a lame party.

121
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,400
女士们  别激动
Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy.

122
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,630
你们每个人都能得到我
There's enough of me for everyone.

123
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,070
嗨  你好
Oh. Hi. Hello.

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
好了  我们要走了...
All right. We're gonna take off..

125
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,080
等等  我和你们一起走
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

126
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,600
泰德・莫斯比  建筑师
Ted Mosby, architect.

127
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,260
相信我
Trust  me.

128
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
只是有点好奇
Hey, just out of curiosity.

129
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,390
如果有人告诉你 他是个建筑师
If  a guy told you he was an architect,

130
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,820
你会怎么想?
what would you think of that?

131
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,980
你开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding?

132
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,210
建筑师很酷
Architects are hot.

133
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,590
你觉得布莱迪先生是怎么约到卡罗尔的? (美国电影脱线家族里布莱迪是建筑师)
How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,240
很好的观点
Solid point.

135
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,200
她的确是有一头金发
She did have hair of gold.

136
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,170
对  是有
- Yes, she did. - Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,810
泰德还在这儿吗?
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

138
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,830
不在
No.

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,690
莉莉
Hey, Lily.

140
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,030
- 你还是单身吗? - 对
- You still single? - Yes.

141
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,660
知道吗...这些年来 我给了你很多免费的饮料
You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years.

142
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,070
很多
A lot.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,470
你真的会和一个为了啤酒
Carl, do you really want to be with a woman

144
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,710
跟人上床的女人在一起?
who would trade sex for beer?

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,660
如果是你  就会
Only if you're into it.

146
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,970
我请你
It's on me.

147
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,510
谢谢
Thanks.

148
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,140
泰德去哪儿了
I wonder where Ted went.

149
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,720
泰德・莫斯比 那个建筑师?
Ted Mosby, the architect?

150
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,860
非常正确
Actually, yeah.

151
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,040
他是个非常酷的男人
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

152
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,560
他刚才还在这儿
He was here earlier.

153
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,940
是什么让你决定 要成为一名建筑师的?
And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?

154
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,560
艺术家的灵魂
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

155
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,880
大师级精湛的手艺
hands of a master craftsman.

156
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,160
我想这是不可避免的
It was inevitable, I guess.

157
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,620
我肯定你会画画  对吗?
I bet you can draw, can't you?

158
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,110
你应该画画我
You should draw me.

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,370
我可以试试 但我怕你最后变成 一个中世纪的3层结构
Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level.

160
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,320
如果你愿意我的朋友马修 邀请我去一个派对  我们可以一起去
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to.

161
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,120
马修也很棒  虽然只是个律师
Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer,

162
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,410
但是总要有人 帮我们这种创作型的人把纸放好吧
but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types.

163
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,890
- 我说的没错吧 - 没错
- Am I right? - Yeah.

164
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,820
-他邀请她去了派对 -天啊 你还好吗?
He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?

165
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,220
好啊  这很好 这样对我们都好
Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win.

166
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,370
泰德找到发泄的地方 我又不用再听他讲
Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it.

167
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,570
也许他唆完之后就会回来
Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over

168
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,090
然后我们就可以开始有趣的部分了
and I'll get the fun part.

169
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,870
你有毛病吗?
What is wrong with you?

170
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,360
天啊  我觉得教你谈恋爱 像是在说外星话
God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here.

171
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,250
你知道当你的男朋友向你诉苦时
Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories

172
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,700
你应该要倾听了
you're supposed to listen?

173
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,670
那么  当他在酒吧 随便约了个女孩去派对的时候
Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar,

174
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,330
你应该要感到害怕
you're supposed to freak out.

175
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,720
我才不害怕呢 我觉得她肯定很胖
I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.

176
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,510
她是健身拳击的教练
She's a kickboxing instructor.

177
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,750
她的屁股比我的脸还好看
Her ass looks better than my face.

178
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,570
好吧  我们改去派对吧
All right, we'll swing by the party.

179
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,000
这个派对是为了马修一些
Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates

180
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,800
从哥伦比亚法学院来的同学办的
from Columbia Law School,

181
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,510
这些人在白天是全国最尖锐
who by day were some of the sharpest

182
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,480
思想最严肃的人
and most serious young legal minds in the country.

183
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,430
但是到了晚上...
By night, however...

184
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,290
该死  这儿都是些 快喝醉的准律师
Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.

185
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,030
说真的...
Okay! Seriously...

186
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,940
谁想要刮我的屁股
who wants to shave my ass?!

187
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,230
这家伙后来变成了 最高法院检察官
That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.

188
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,790
那些家伙和他们勾搭的女人在哪儿?
Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,540
你们好啊  女士们 欢迎来这个派对
Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah!

190
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
只需在这里签上你们的名字 表示同意这里的主人
Just need you to sign this release protecting the host

191
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,340
不用对某位或是所有人 有可能的自我伤害行为负责
from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself

192
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,460
或是第三方的行为负责
or a third party.

193
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,190
然后就尽情狂欢吧
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,210
醉了的法律人士 你有见过马修・埃里克森吗?
Hey, drunk legal dude, um... have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

195
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,760
他和一个叫泰德的人在一起
He was with a guy named Ted.

196
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,860
泰德・莫斯比 那个建筑师?
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

197
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,510
真是个梦想家！
Man, what a visionary.

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,620
没错  他们刚才在这儿
Yeah, they were here.

199
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
获奖的确很棒 它们很配我的架子
Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf.

200
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,130
没有什么称赞比得上
But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy

201
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,350
看到太阳从你设计的 第一幢楼前冉冉升起的快乐
of seeing the sun rise over your first building.

202
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,670
Wow.

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,570
我很乐意和你一起看日出
I would love to watch the sun rise with you.

204
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,550
我知道  你会的
I know you would.

205
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,750
这可是个工作
It's the job.

206
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,540
你今晚应该让我们刮你的屁股
Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.

207
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,390
没门
No way.

208
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,760
马修  莉莉在哪儿?
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?

209
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,730
我不想这么早毁了大家的派对
I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh...

210
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,040
但是  大家都请坐
everyone take a seat.

211
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,620
莉莉今年夏天取消了原定的婚礼
Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer

212
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,620
去了旧金山
to go to San Francisco.

213
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,150
所以...
So...

214
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,190
我们分手了
we're broken up.

215
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,790
她的名字不在租约上吧?
Her name wasn't on your lease, was it?

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,130
如果没有的话  根据纽约洲的法律 你没有义务
'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated

217
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,620
在你搬的时候要给她一半的定金
to give her half the deposit when you move.

218
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,550
那不是我真正担心的部分
Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.

219
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,160
不要忘了史密斯・罗赛贝特 74年的案例
And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

220
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,380
她所有留在你房子里的东西
Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling

221
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,260
过了30天后就是你的了
become yours after 30 days.

222
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,050
我们能不能暂时不要 用律师的观点来看
Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute?

223
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,680
爱已死
Love died.

224
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,440
那个让你陷入爱河的爱 它现在已经死了
The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.

225
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,620
你应该起诉她
You should sue her.

226
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,300
真的吗? 为了什么呢  凯拉?
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

227
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,480
理由就是...闭嘴
On the grounds of... shut up.

228
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,860
那是我们的法律代理人
That's our attorney general.

229
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,730
看到吗?马修还陷在我们 分手问题上
See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup.

230
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,960
为什么? 因为我都听他说话
Why? Because I listened to him.

231
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,650
那是段坚定  稳固的感情
It was a strong and nurturing relationship

232
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,800
而我把它当旧口香糖似的抛弃了
that I threw away like old gum.

233
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,140
我不是在担心什么 不过  说回泰德的"日出"
Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising

234
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,680
用什么话形容她最贴切的?
over Ted and, uh... oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?

235
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,550
那个姑娘有个超棒的臀部
The girl with the smackable ass.

236
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,020
没错  就是那位年轻女士
Yes, that's the young lady.

237
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,760
我认识个电音俱乐部的保安
So,  I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers.

238
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,540
你想和我一起去跳舞吗?
Do you feel like dancing?

239
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,400
很好  泰德不可能会去跳舞的
Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing.

240
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,840
泰德讨厌俱乐部
Ted hates clubs.

241
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,310
当然  我喜欢俱乐部
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

242
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,590
虽然我今晚应该要设计大教堂
I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight,

243
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,580
我要解开上帝和人类之间的关系
kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum.

244
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,340
但是没问题  我们去跳舞吧
But sure, let's go dancing.

245
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,560
等等  我和我朋友说一声
Wait, let me just check with my friend.

246
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,380
好的
Okay.

247
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,240
你想去一个超级吵闹 不断重复放些
Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music

248
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,210
从90年代中期就没变过 音乐的地方吗？
that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?

249
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,860
当然要去了
Um... only always.

250
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,790
走吧
Let's go.

251
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,530
跳舞?他和个女孩去跳舞?
Dancing? He went dancing with this girl?

252
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,710
也许这就不太好了
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

253
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,380
跳舞太糟了 跳完就该上床了
Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to sex.

254
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,670
你终于从自由之城成长了吗?
Did you grow up in that Footloose town?

255
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,100
我要打给他 我要告诉他我错了
I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong

256
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,530
我很抱歉  而且 我非常想听他那些愚蠢的故事
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.

257
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,560
想个别的方法来说 你会没事的...
Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.

258
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,470
他不接电话
He's not answering.

259
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
打给马修
Calling Marshall.

260
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,800
喂
Hello.

261
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,530
马修  我是罗宾 我能和泰德说话吗?
Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?

262
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,320
罗比  你好啊
Oh, Robin, hi.

263
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,300
不  泰德今晚不在这儿 他...他在工作
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.

264
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,000
好的 再见
Uh, okay. Bye.

265
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,450
马修在骗我
Marshall just lied.

266
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,000
泰德出轨了
Ted's cheating on me.

267
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,830
不好意思  我要找一对 早些时候来过这儿的两个男人
Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier.

268
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,580
一个大约6英尺4英寸 重210磅 浅棕色头发
One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair.

269
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,930
还有一个是出轨的混蛋
And the other's a cheating bastard.

270
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,850
你需要更新一下我的记忆
You're going to need to refresh my memory.

271
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,270
好的  小伙子 我们知道规矩
Okay, fella, baby knows how this game's played.

272
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,910
20美金能帮你想起来吗?
How's a $20 help your memory?

273
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,700
谢谢  但是说真的 今晚太疯狂了
Thanks,  but seriously, it was crazy tonight.

274
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,370
你真的应该更新一下我的记忆
You really do need to refresh my memory.

275
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,130
那我能不能...?
Then can I have the...?

276
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,870
没关系  你留着吧
That's cool. You keep that.

277
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,310
我们要找的人是个建筑师
So these guys-- one of them's an architect.

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,770
泰德・莫斯比 那个建筑师?
Ted Mosby, the architect?

279
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,860
就是他
That's the one.

280
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,120
对 他来过这里
Oh, yeah, he was here.

281
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,050
然后我说  不  弗兰克・杰瑞 这次你把自己黑了
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry. You're on your own this time."

282
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,930
这就是那个黑客最后的职业生涯
And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.

283
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,470
我就住在街对面
I live across the street.

284
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,680
那可真是出人意料
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

285
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,090
你想去坐一会儿?
You want to come over?

286
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,390
我还不确定
Well, I don't know.

287
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,890
但至少我应该送你回家
But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home.

288
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,380
跳上来
Hop on.

289
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,270
我们一会儿在书吧见  温尼
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

290
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,910
- 我会给你带三明治的 - 太棒了
 - Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudite. - Nice.

291
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,310
兄弟  兄弟  你这是干什么?
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

292
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,790
奔跑啊
Galloping.

293
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,580
你已经证实了建筑师 泰德・莫斯比 确实能泡到妞
You proved it, all right? The whole Ted Mosby, architect things works.

294
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,800
建筑师法则
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

295
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,700
你真的一点也不担心有人
Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody

296
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,690
可能会发现你现在所作所为?
might find out that you're doing this?

297
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,030
这不是你  泰德
This isn't you, Ted.

298
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,910
今天就是这样
It is tonight.

299
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,680
Whoo!

300
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,990
你认识这个女的 她住哪儿?
You know this girl. Where does she live?

301
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,320
你至少要给我20块 不然我不会告诉你的
I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.

302
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,423
- 我没钱了 - 我也是
- Well, I'm out of money. - I'm cashed, too.

303
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,390
你的手袋我也收
I'll take your purse.

304
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,460
我的手袋?
My purse?

305
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,080
我女朋友喜欢clutche的东西
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

306
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,870
好吧  给你
Okay, fine.

307
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,830
你要告诉她 这个和巧克力色靴子很配
You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.

308
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,970
你该庆幸我带的是我最小的手袋
Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse.

309
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,090
没地方能放我的枪  给你
No room for my gun. Here.

310
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,590
快说  那个荡妇住哪里?
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

311
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,900
那个亮绿灯的大楼 3楼C座
The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.

312
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:59,352
我的天啊  罗宾
Oh, my God, Robin,

313
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,800
你是不是要狠狠揍她一顿
are you going to kick this girl's ass?

314
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,433
没错
Yeah...

315
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,880
还要偷了她的手袋
and steal her purse.

316
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,240
真不敢相信 他竟然背着我偷情
I can't believe he's cheating on me.

317
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,100
你知道我有多少次这样的机会?
You know how many times I could have cheated?

318
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,430
6...不 7次
Six... no seven.

319
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,000
如果你知道其中的两个是谁 你会很惊讶的
And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.

320
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,400
3楼C座  开始吧 你准备好了?
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

321
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,940
我是不是应该踢门进去?
Should I just kick the door in?

322
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,010
这双高跟鞋真的很好看 你的手袋已经没了...
Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse.

323
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,210
看看门有没有锁
Let's see if it's unlocked.

324
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,810
没锁
It's unlocked.

325
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,790
好吧  我们进去 狠狠踹她屁股一脚
Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass.

326
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,750
罗宾
Robin.

327
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,000
- 有问题的是我 - 什么?
- I'm the problem. - What?

328
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,330
你说得对
You were right.

329
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,650
我不知道怎么做女朋友
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

330
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,040
我找到了世界上最好的男人
I took the nicest guy in the world

331
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:43,672
却把他弄成了个爱情骗子
and I made him a cheater.

332
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,280
别光站在这儿贬低你自己
Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up.

333
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,170
进去揍泰德一顿
Get in there and beat Ted up.

334
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:50,372
我来处理那个下贱的自由搏击手
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

335
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,260
事实上  我还是处理泰德吧
Actually, I'll take Ted.

336
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,030
- 我们开始吧 - 我来了
- Let's do this. - Bring it.

337
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,210
你知道你在干...
What do you think you're...?

338
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,480
巴尼?
Barney?

339
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,920
谢天谢地  你们来了 能帮我解开吗?我没有指甲
Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.

340
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,490
我现在完全糊涂了 泰德在哪儿?
Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?

341
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,690
泰德?他在工作啊
Ted? He's at work.

342
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,450
你怎么会在这儿的?
How did you get here?

343
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,310
好棒的故事  像往常一样
Awesome story. As per usual.

344
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,903
你觉得布莱迪先生 是怎么约到卡罗尔的?
How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?

345
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,660
很好的观点
Solid point.

346
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,170
- 而且她确实有一头金发 - 对 没错
- And she did have hair of gold. - Yes, she did.

347
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,290
对不起  我忘了我的 我忘了看性感拳击赛的望远镜了
Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing.

348
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,530
看来这里有更性感的东西嘛
Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.

349
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,010
没错  是有 而且你来得正好
Yes, they did. And you're just in time.

350
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,010
姑娘们  我要走了 但是我留下个好货 只要你们不嫌脏
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

351
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,010
不要走  我们还不知道你的名字 怎么知道哪座楼是你设计的
Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.

352
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,090
对啊 别走 (快走)
Yeah, stay.

353
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,070
请稍等一下
Excuse us for one second.

354
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,080
你说得没错 用建筑师的魅力真的有效
Okay, you were right-- the architect thing totally works.

355
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,850
但是我已经有女朋友了 而且我现在要回去工作了
But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work.

356
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,510
这个工程越来越难做了(暗指抛唇ㄖ越来越硬了)
This project is getting harder and harder.

357
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,640
- 讲得好 - 谢谢
- Yeah, you did. - Yeah, had to.

358
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,900
再见
See ya.

359
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,550
对不起  我的... 实习生必须要走了
Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.

360
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,440
太可惜了
Oh, well, that's too bad.

361
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,540
对了  我是安娜
I'm Anna, by the way.

362
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,460
泰德・莫斯比 建筑师
Ted Mosby... architect.

363
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,650
但是没有一种称赞能和那种
But  none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy

364
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,210
看着太阳在你的处女作那儿 冉冉升起的快乐相比
of seeing the sun rise over your first building.

365
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,990
- 兄弟  兄弟  你这是干什么? - 奔跑
- Dude, dude, what are you doing? - Galloping.

366
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,470
你已经证实了用泰德・莫斯比 建筑师 确实能泡到妞
All right, you proved it. The whole Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

367
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,700
建筑师法则
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

368
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,850
你真的一点也不担心有人 可能会发现你现在所作所为吗?
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this?

369
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,900
这不是你 泰德
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

370
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,940
今天是...
It is tonight.

371
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,840
接下来的几个小时
And that led to a couple of hours

372
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,810
作为一名绅士 我不能  告诉你
that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you.

373
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,760
我们在这儿  这儿 还有这儿做了
We did it right here, and here and here.

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,860
但是你为什么要用泰德的名字?
But why would you use Ted's name?

375
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,230
我最近在互联网上有点坏名声
I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web.

376
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,130
所有我对用真名有点顾虑
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole "using my real name" thing.

377
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,520
太好了  根本不是泰德 什么问题都没了
Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

378
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,490
并不是没问题了
Everything isn't okay.

379
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,860
看看我  我像个疯子似的 嫉妒而且还在乱想
Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.

380
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,650
人们谈恋爱的时候就是这样的
This is how people act in relationships.

381
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,530
那就是我不想陷入感情的原因
And that's why I avoid relationships.

382
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,380
知道吗
Well, guess what,

383
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,600
我已经好几个月没有发疯 嫉妒或是乱想了
I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months,

384
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,900
我真的很想那样
and I really miss it.

385
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,880
这一段的结尾就是 让我们在巴尼一夜情的房间里
And thus ended this chapter of, "Let's pour our hearts out

386
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,200
互诉心房吧
in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."

387
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,180
快点我们要在 她洗完澡前离开
Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.

388
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,710
你真是头猪 你甚至不打算说声再见吗?
You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?

389
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,420
正如你们所见 我写了封公式信
I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter

390
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,850
专门为了在这种情况下用的
for use in just such an occasion.

391
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,010
只要填上名字  然后...
Just fill out her name and then...

392
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,930
好像是有个A的
Something with a "A."

393
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:02,792
A... A...

394
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,570
我就写"公民"吧
I'll just put "resident."

395
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,860
撤  撤  撤  撤
Go, go, go, go.

396
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,950
罗宾那晚走了很久
Robin took a long walk that night.

397
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,650
她思考着怎么 向另一个人敞开胸怀
She thought about how opening yourself up to another person

398
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,010
通常放开胸怀意味着 变得有点疯狂
usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy.

399
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,820
她想了如果一个人的话 会更容易些
She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone.

400
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,690
然后她来见了我
And then she came to see me.

401
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:35,352
# And I am nothing of a builder #

402
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:40,310
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... # Hey.

403
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,080
Hey.

404
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,860
- 你来这儿干嘛? - 我带了点唐纳兹(甜面包圈)
- What are you doing here? - I brought donuts.

405
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,650
我不是吹牛 他们放了很多果酱
And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.

406
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,620
谢谢
Thanks.

407
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,940
那么...你今晚怎么样?
So, uh... how was your night?

408
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,200
还...不错 没什么特别的
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

409
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,630
你呢?
How was yours?

410
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,460
你真的想听无聊 建筑师的事情吗?
You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?

411
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,470
是的  我想听
Yes, I do.

412
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,260
之前的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about earlier.

413
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,400
我根本没看完过梦幻之地
To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams.

414
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,830
我看到一半就睡着了
I fell asleep half way through.

415
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,040
什么?最后20分钟是精华部分
What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.

416
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,720
也许他们应该把那部分提前一点 因为...
Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

417
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,790
知道吗?
You know what, um...

418
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,750
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is...

419
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,090
我喜欢当你的"垃圾桶"
I love being the person you bitch to.

420
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,200
今天过得怎么样? 建筑师先生
So how was your day, Mr. Architect?

421
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,670
我喜欢你那样说话
Oh, I like the way you say that.

422
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,500
你想看看那座大楼吗？
Hey, you want to see the building

423
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,730
那会让斯普肯所有的男人 觉得自己不够大
that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?

424
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,430
很明显
Obviously.

425
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,130
- 哇 - 没错吧
- Wow. - Yeah.

426
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,420
你没提到底边那圈叶子
You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base.

427
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,310
如果能修修底部 剩下的看起来会更大
If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.

428
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,540
你不用告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,800
还有...纯粹为了好玩... 我已经
And, um... just for fun, I've...

430
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,680
我做了我理想中的建筑的图纸
I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be.

431
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,970
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

432
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,760
还记得第一次去斯普肯 我指给你们看的那栋摩天楼?
You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper?

433
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,550
那是我的第一件设计品
That was the first building I ever designed.

434
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,070
而那天晚上是我第一次 把我的手稿给别人看
And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

435
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:21,281
Wow.

436
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,020
泰德  这太棒了
Ted, this is amazing.

437
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,950
谢谢
Thanks.

438
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,900
也许并不会真的建成
It's not like it will ever come to anything.

439
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,670
那我就不知道了
I don't know.

440
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,130
但是有些事是可能的
It might come to something.

441
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,300
姑娘们都认为建筑师非常帅
You know, girls find architects very hot.

442
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,920
好的
Okay,

443
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,330
不过你可不要期望什么 "78层"或别的东西(暗指"别指望他的那啥能有那么长")
but I don't want you expecting 78 stories or anything.

444
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,820
亲爱的公民
"Dear Resident...

445
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,750
我们一起度过的时光 不管多久
The time we spent together, however long it was,

446
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,620
对我来说都是我的全部
meant the world to me.

447
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,550
我很愿意再一次见你 但是很不幸  我不能
I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot.

448
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,040
要知道  我是个鬼魂
You see, I am a ghost.

449
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,960
我只能每10年 在我死祭的那天
I can't only materialize once every decade

450
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,480
成形一次
on the anniversary of my death.

451
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,630
在我活着的这天 我选择和你一起度过
I chose to spend my one day among the living with you,

452
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,690
亲爱的  公民
sweet... Resident.

453
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,610
也许我们会在 下一个10年再次见面
Perhaps we will meet again in another decade,

454
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,930
到那时一定要保持 你现在的身材
provided you keep your figure.

455
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,470
给你我来自远方的爱
Until then, all my love from the beyond.

456
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,200
巴尼
Barney."

457
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,810
巴尼？
Barney?

458
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,520
这该死的巴尼是谁?
Who the hell is Barney?
