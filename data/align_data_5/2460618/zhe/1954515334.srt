老爸老妈浪漫史
第八季  第六集

10
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,860
<i>2012年的秋天</i>
<i>In the fall of 2012,</i>

11
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,020
<i>尼克和罗宾感情越来越好</i>
<i>Nick and Robin were going strong.</i>

12
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,140
<i>有时很难说究竟是什么</i>
<i>Sometimes it's hard to say what it is exactly</i>

13
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,250
<i>让一对情侣"琴瑟和鸣"</i>
<i>that makes a couple click.</i>

14
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,240
妙极了
Bravissimo!

15
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,460
<i>不管是什么  孩子们  尼克和罗宾</i>
<i>Whatever it was, kids, Nick and Robin</i>

16
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,950
<i>起初真的很合拍</i>
<i>really connected at first.</i>

17
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,450
我觉得我们之间
Hey, you know, I think I'm really starting

18
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,500
好像真的有什么...
to feel something here..

19
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,450
<i>但后来这种情况时常发生  他们开始渐行渐远</i>
<i>But then, as often happens, they started to drift apart.</i>

20
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,650
<i>为什么</i>
<i>Why?</i>

21
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>谁知道呢</i>
<i>Who can say?</i>

22
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,470
我和尼克都三天没做爱了
Nick and I haven't had sex in three days.

23
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,950
这全赖你
And it's your fault.

24
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,840
尼克不肯做爱
Nick won't have sex

25
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,370
是因为他拉伤了腹股沟肌肉
because he pulled his groin muscle,

26
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,010
都怪你让他加入白痴篮球队
all 'cause you made him join your stupid basketball team.

27
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,440
你刚才是说"白痴篮球队"吗
Did you say "stupid basketball team"?

28
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,180
-对  -天啊  伙计们
- Yeah. - Oh, my gosh, guys,

29
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,150
我们得赶紧把罗宾送去医院
we have to rush Robin to the hospital.

30
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,760
因为她把声带咽下去了
Because somehow, she swallowed her vocal cords

31
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
现在卡在直肠里
and they got lodged in her rectum,

32
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,850
所以她都用屁股说"屁话"
because she's talking out of her ass.

33
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,820
先驱广场娱乐中心

34
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,920
<i>这个夏天  马修加入</i>
<i>Over the summer, Marshall had joined</i>

35
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>一支市中心的职业篮球联盟</i>
<i>a midtown professionals basketball league.</i>

36
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>他的律师队取名为"不可抗力"</i>
<i>His team of lawyers was called The Force Majeurs.</i>

37
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,500
取自法律名词"force majeure"

38
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,570
<i>自从他们输给了一支会计队</i>
<i>Ever since they lost to a group of accountants,</i>

39
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,930
<i>他就开始有点过于较真</i>
<i>he'd started getting a little intense about it.</i>

40
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,450
你确定没偷用一两个职业篮球员吗  乔尔
You sure you didn't have a ringer or two out there, Joel?

41
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,200
不知道你在说什么
Don't know what you're talking about.

42
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,990
刚才的进攻真不错  阿布巴卡尔
Good hustle out there, Aboubakar!

43
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,100
如果乔尔能找人来冒名顶替  我们也可以
If Joel can use ringers, then so can we.

44
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,620
尼克是我们最优秀的球员
And Nick is our best player.

45
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,840
所以依我看来
So as far as I'm concerned,

46
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,240
你们俩都该"冷藏"下腹股沟
you can both keep your groins on ice.

47
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,350
"冰上腹股沟"吗
Groins on Ice.

48
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,150
麦迪逊广场最不受欢迎的假日节目
Least popular Madison Square Garden holiday show ever.

49
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,170
你为什么那么热衷于这个篮球联盟
Why are you so into this basketball league?

50
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,740
罗宾  这是30岁以上在市区工作人士的
Robin, it's the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30

51
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,420
小常春藤专业人员联盟
Who Work In Midtown League.

52
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,190
这可是玩真的
It's the show!

53
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,520
说来也有趣
You know, it's kind of funny,

54
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,030
想象下人们把冰块放在腹股沟上
imagining people icing their groins.

55
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,450
一开始会很凉很冰
I mean, first they'd be all cold,

56
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,100
然后冰会开始融化
and then the ice would start to melt, and

57
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,270
那里就会变湿  "大湿特湿"
things would get all wet and... steamy.

58
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,890
好了  莉莉
Okay, Lily.

59
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,910
听着  伙计
Look, buddy,

60
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,200
我也是"30岁以上在市区工作人士的
I'm also the captain of a team

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,850
小常春藤专业人员联盟"
in the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30

62
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,480
其中一队的队长
Who Work In Midtown League.

63
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,770
我也为那刺激感着迷
I'm addicted to the adrenaline, too.

64
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,860
不过  你不觉得你有点
Still, don't you think you're getting

65
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,920
太过痴迷于...
a little obsessive about...

66
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,170
打住  打住
Uh, hold up, hold up.

67
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,130
你刚是说你不但
Are you suggesting that you are

68
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,070
是篮球队的一员  而且还是队长吗
a member of a sports team and you're the captain?

69
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,240
说到"队长"
So says the "C"

70
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,430
我还把这个词缝到运动衫上了呢
I personally sewed onto my jersey.

71
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,860
我和维多利亚分手后
After Victoria and I broke up,

72
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,300
有空闲时间了
I had some free time.

73
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,460
所以我叫上了几个建筑师朋友
So, called up a few architect friends

74
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,930
组了个篮球队  名叫
and put together a little team called

75
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,070
"T字尺"[建筑师常用绘图工具]
the T-Squares.

76
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,290
看到了吗
See that?

77
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,080
地面不平
The floor's uneven.

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,660
那个窗户的设计也烂死了
And that window placement is rubbish.

79
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,620
如果精灵给我一个愿望
You know, if a genie gave me one wish,

80
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,560
我会拆掉那堵墙  然后重新整整
I would knock down that wall and create a nice flow.

81
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
好愿望
Great wish.

82
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,590
硬木太多了  对吧
I mean, there's too much hardwood, right?

83
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,140
你们这群书呆子到底打没打篮球啊
Did you nerds actually play any basketball?

84
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,520
我们这群书呆子  专注的是更重要的东西
Um, us nerds focused on something far more important:

85
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,180
感情凝聚
bonding.

86
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,210
你们肯定会被操傻了吧
You guys are going to get pounded.

87
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,720
而我却没那个福气
And I am not.

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,290
拜托  你几周不做爱都受不了吗
Oh, come on. You can't go a couple weeks without sex?

89
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,230
我们的控球后卫是个52岁的处男  快乐得很
Our point guard's a 52-year-old virgin, happy as a clam.

90
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,080
那他一定控得"一手好球"
I'm sure he's quite a ball handler.

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,820
问题是  现在我们不做爱
The problem is, now that we're not having sex,

92
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,980
就更多机会谈话
we're talking more,

93
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,190
而我发现尼克有点...
and I'm realizing that Nick is kind of...

94
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,280
蠢
dumb.

95
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,000
-真的吗  -不是吧
- Really? - News to me.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,820
-我没注意到  -不
- I hadn't noticed that. - No.

97
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,620
天啊
Oh, my God.

98
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,760
你们也觉得他蠢吗
You guys think that he's dumb, too?

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
-蠢爆了  -脑子比气囊还空
- So dumb. - Air bags are sharper.

100
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,820
肌肉身材  肌肉脑袋
Hot as lava but just as thick.

101
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,490
你们什么时候开始注意到他蠢的
When did you guys start to notice that he was kind of dumb?

102
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,440
尼克在做字谜游戏的时候
Well, there was that time Nick was doing the crossword.

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,300
跟"Cut"同义的四字词是什么
Hey, what's a four-letter word for cut?

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,300
"cut"和"nick"都有切的意思

105
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,250
-尼克[Nick]  -什么事
- "Nick." - Yeah?

106
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,090
是与"cut"同义的四字词啊
Is a four-letter word for cut.

107
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,920
是什么
What is?

108
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,740
-"Nick"  -怎么了
- "Nick." - What?

109
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,160
知道了
Oh. I got it.

110
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,440
是"Shave"[五字]
"Shave."

111
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,440
"cut"和"shave"都有削的意思

112
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,200
还有他评论吉普赛人的时候
And there was the comment about Gypsies.

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
不不  我觉得吉普赛人现在
No, no. I think Gypsies prefer

114
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,960
更爱被叫做罗姆人
to be called Romani now.

115
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,500
是吗  真的吗
Do they? Really?

116
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,380
那独角兽  精灵
And what do unicorns and, uh, elves

117
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,910
和矮妖更爱被叫做什么呢
and leprechauns prefer to be called?

118
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,170
你知道吉普赛人
You do know, uh, Gypsies are

119
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,150
是真实存在的族群吧
a real ethnic group that actually exists?

120
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,850
伙计们  真是太惭愧了
Oh, you guys, I feel terrible now.

121
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,190
我一直以为他们是虚构的
I always thought they were just made up,

122
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,160
就跟地精  巨魔和海豚一样
like goblins or trolls or dolphins.

123
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,690
还有你说过  你跟尼克是怎样
And then there's that story you told about how you and Nick

124
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,650
搭上一个丹麦交换生
picked up that Danish exchange student

125
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,710
然后三人共浴的事
and you all took a shower together.

126
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,940
我从没说过那种事
I never told a story like that.

127
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,870
那现在可以说了
Well, no time like the present.

128
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,880
我们给那个丹麦骚货取个名字
Let's give this Danish ho a name.

129
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,220
就纳迪亚吧
I'm thinking Nadia.

130
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,090
对  这名字放荡不羁  而且性向不明
Yeah, she sounds slutty and bi-curious.

131
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,120
你到底怎么了
What is wrong with you?

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,290
你孩子就在那边
Your kid is right there.

133
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,320
要不要别这么黄啊
Maybe want to clean it up a lit...

134
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,690
你挂个宝宝  还练引体向上
You're wearing a baby and you're doing pull-ups?

135
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,560
不  泰德  我闲坐着等肌肉变软
No, Ted, I'm sitting around getting soft,

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,890
因为冠军"从不锻炼"
'cause that's what champions do.

137
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,280
问题是  现在我知道尼克有多蠢
The problem is, now that I know how dumb Nick is,

138
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,260
我得重新考虑这段感情
it's kind of making me reconsider the relationship.

139
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,220
为什么
Why?

140
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,280
最后  尼克的腹股沟会康复
Eventually, Nick's groin will heal

141
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,800
你们也会重登巫山
and you'll be back in Sexville,

142
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,180
重登巫山后  填字游戏只是浮云
where all the crossword puzzles only have one box to fill.

143
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,980
说到双重标准
Talk about a double standard.

144
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,430
每次我追不会看时间的大胸无脑女
Every time I go after a busty dullard who can't tell time

145
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,400
或以为我是莱昂纳多鬼魂的蠢妹  
or thinks I'm the ghost of Leonardo DiCaprio,

146
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,250
我就被骂肤浅
I'm shallow.

147
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,150
但是罗宾却可以和一个
But somehow it's okay for Robin to date a guy

148
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,430
逛街时不能离开家长视线的蠢货
who can't be trusted around outlets.

149
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,770
甩了他
Dump him!

150
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,180
行了  太荒谬了
Okay, that is ridiculous.

151
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,100
尼克是天才吗  不是
Is Nick a genius? No.

152
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,860
他的智商有平均水平吗
But does he have average intelligence?

153
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,030
也没有
No.

154
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,860
但是他是一个人  有感情的人
But he is a human being, with a heart!

155
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,850
你是害怕  如果我甩了他  会影响到比赛
And you're afraid if I dump him, it'll throw off his game.

156
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,790
罗宾  上周他拿了36分和17个篮板球
Robin, he got 36 points and 17 rebounds last week.

157
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,310
那还是他球鞋穿错脚时的表现
And that was with his shoes on the wrong feet.

158
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,480
好吧  你们可能想知道
Well, you're probably all wondering

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,010
T字尺队现在是怎么训练的
how the T-Squares' practice went today.

160
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,270
T什么
The T-What?

161
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,890
我们用头脑比赛
We played up here.

162
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,090
其实人们并不知道  
Basketball, people don't realize,

163
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,570
篮球关系到几何学  物理学和工程学
is all geometry, physics and engineering.

164
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,560
如果你像建筑家那样思考
If you think like an architect,

165
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,910
不用摸到球  就能赢一千场比赛
you could win a thousand games without ever touching a ball.

166
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,650
你的球怎么了
What happened to your ball?

167
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,810
隔壁的希伯来小孩会把球抢了
Some kids from the Hebrew school next door took it

168
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,570
而且不还我们
and wouldn't give it back.

169
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,420
和尼克的分手进行得如何了
How'd the breakup with Nick go?

170
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,840
那个...
Well...

171
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,360
我今天去找了算命师
So, I went to this fortune teller today

172
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,330
她说我身上有个诅咒
and she said there was a curse on me.

173
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,010
那她告诉你怎么驱除了吗
Did she sell you something to ward off the curse?

174
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,720
这你也猜到  你跟她一样神啊
It's like you're a fortune teller, too.

175
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,060
尼克
Nick, um...

176
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,040
我们得谈谈
I think we need to talk. Yeah.

177
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,200
就是...
Uh... it's just...

178
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,850
练得好结实
Whoa, these are hard.

179
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,670
反正这条五百元的手链
Anyway, this $500 bracelet will ward off evil

180
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,400
可以辟邪一周
till the end of the week, so...

181
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,900
你觉得你可以
Do you think that you could do,

182
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,370
边说话边做仰卧起坐什么的吗
uh, sit-ups or something while you talk?

183
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,940
可以啊
Yeah.

184
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,500
总之  这个算命师
Anyway, this fortune teller,

185
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,240
她仅从我的信用卡 
she was able to tell me all sorts of stuff about my future,

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,600
社保号和驾照
just from my credit cards

187
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,900
就能预见我的将来
and my social security number, driver's license.

188
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,400
我就知道你会失败
I knew you'd cave.

189
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,840
所以为了让你和尼克分手
Which is why I came up with

190
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,180
我想出了一个激励你的方法
a little extra incentive to break up with Nick.

191
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,680
晚上八点分手  要么这个邀请生效
End it by 8:00 P.M. Tonight or this invite goes live.

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,840
"罗宾和帕特里斯的闺蜜玩乐日"
"Robin and Patrice's BFF fun day?!"

193
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,750
<i>孩子们  帕特里斯是罗宾的同事</i>
<i>Kids, Patrice was a coworker of Robin's</i>

194
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,480
<i>她有点巴着罗宾不放</i>
<i>who'd become sort of obsessed with her.</i>

195
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,290
<i>罗宾一直到现在都设法</i>
<i>Robin had managed, until now,</i>

196
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,690
<i>和帕特里斯保持距离</i>
<i>to keep Patrice at arms length.</i>

197
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,440
<i>不过如果帕特里斯被邀请来参加</i>
<i>But if Patrice were invited to something called</i>

198
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,070
<i>"罗宾和帕特里斯的闺蜜玩乐日"</i>
<i>Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day,</i>

199
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
<i>她会一直粘着罗宾  绝不放手</i>
<i>she'd latch onto Robin and never let go.</i>

200
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,390
你为什么这么做
Why would you do that?

201
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,830
马上删掉
Delete that right now!

202
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,690
不  我不给你点压力
No! If I don't give you a little push,

203
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,210
你就一直拖  拖到他能再登巫山
you'll let this drag on until Nick can have sex again,

204
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,970
到时候你又会在床上任他摆布  并继续拖延
and then you'll be right back to procrastinating on all fours.

205
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,090
不得不承认  穿西服的男士说得对
I hate to admit it, but the man in the suit has a point.

206
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,250
好吧  不过季后赛就快开始了
Fine, but the playoffs are coming up soon,

207
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,660
他可不能精神崩溃啊
and I can't have this guy an emotional wreck.

208
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,590
如果你要甩他  委婉点吧
If you do dump him, at least let him down easy.

209
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,600
对  带他去一家精致的餐馆
Yeah, take him to a nice restaurant.

210
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,320
最好是吃甜点的地方
Preferably a dessert place.

211
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,990
那样你就不必等吃完一顿饭
That way, you won't have to sit through a whole meal

212
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,860
才到...
before you get to...

213
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,400
-分手点  -正解
- Splitsville. - Exactly.

214
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
我说的是"分手甜品店"
No, Splitsville.

215
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,570
在街角的那个甜品店
It's a dessert place right around the corner.

216
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,820
分手的必去场所
It's sort of the place to end a relationship.

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,690
尼克  听我说
Uh, Nick, listen.

218
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,100
你是个很好的人
You are awesome

219
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,270
好到爆  但是我们...
and totally sweet, but we're just not...

220
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,450
你知道我要说什么  是吧
You know where I'm going with this, right?

221
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,580
不  不知道
No. No clue.

222
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,400
我觉得我们不该再"见面"了
I don't know if we should keep seeing each other.

223
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,640
你是想  关灯做爱  看不到对方吗
You want to start turning off the lights during sex?

224
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,180
不  天啊  不是
No. God, no.

225
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,760
不是  不是
No! No.

226
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,730
我觉得我们不太适合做情侣[我们不锻炼]
I am just worried that, as a couple, we're not working out.

227
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,360
你想一起去健身房吗
You want to start going to the gym together?

228
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,030
不是  尼克  事情是这样的
Okay, no, Nick, here is the deal.

229
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,880
对不起  亲爱的  接个电话
Sorry, babe. I got to take this.

230
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
抱歉
Excuse me.

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,300
喂
Hello.

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
怎么了
Hey, what's up?

233
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,480
你...
You...

234
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,710
什么...  我...
What? I...

235
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,510
我不明白
I don't understand.

236
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,070
不过你...
But you...

237
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,570
好吧  其实呢
Okay, um, you know what?

238
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,150
对不起  我得挂了
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.

239
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,430
怎么回事
What happened?

240
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,220
我...
I...

241
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,860
我...
I, um...

242
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,560
抱歉  我不想说
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't talk about this.

243
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,330
对了
Anyway,

244
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,630
你刚想要说什么
what were you going to say?

245
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,470
我想说
Uh... I was gonna say,

246
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,980
你还想吃什么  随便点
order whatever else you want.

247
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,780
我请客[放在我身上]
It's on me.

248
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,880
谢了  不过我还是
Well, thanks, but I think I'd just rather

249
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,710
放在碗里吃吧
eat it out of a bowl.

250
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,840
你们还想知道
Well, no doubt you're all wondering

251
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,890
T字尺队第一场比赛是什么情况
how the T-Square's first game went.

252
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,160
什么队
What Squares?

253
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,970
想象一台完美协调的机器
Picture a well-oiled machine.

254
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,310
你的缝纫机吗
Your sewing machine?

255
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,690
时间只剩下两秒钟了
There were two seconds left on the clock.

256
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,330
阿布巴卡尔全力防守我
Aboubakar was all over me.

257
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,900
突然间我多年以来所受的建筑学训练
And that's when all my years of architectural training

258
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,620
成为了我的神助
came to my aid.

259
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,570
我看见了对手绝对发现不了的空隙
I saw the space in a way my opponents never would.

260
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,750
帅呆了
Yes!

261
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,230
我就说我会投进这种球的
I told you guys I'd make one of these!

262
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,410
结果  这个进球也被判无效
Turns out, those two points were taken away

263
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,390
因为他们说这球"出界"了
because apparently the ball went "out of bounds."

264
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,320
不过别担心
But don't worry,

265
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,300
我已经向联赛办公室申诉了
I'm appealing to the league office.

266
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,770
那个阿布巴卡尔  打完你们是一起冲澡吗
This Aboubakar-- I'm assuming you showered with the guy?

267
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,770
描述一下共浴的情景
Paint me a word picture.

268
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,610
你好
Hello.

269
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,400
莉莉  巴尼在吗
Lil, is Barney there?

270
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,870
他都不接电话
He's not answering his phone.

271
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,950
他现在有点小忙呢
Mm, he's a little busy right now.

272
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,900
是罗宾打来的
It's Robin.

273
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,870
37...  38...
37... 38...

274
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,490
打开免提放给我听  39
Put her on speaker. 39...

275
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,010
你什么时候变得如此孔武有力了
When did you start being able to do stuff like this?

276
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,780
几个月前  你连做个三明治
A few months ago, you had to catch your breath

277
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,660
都累得上气不接下气
after making a sandwich.

278
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,430
巴尼  快把"罗宾
Barney, delete the Robin

279
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,530
和帕特里斯的闺蜜玩乐日"的邀请删了
and Patrice's BFF Fun Day invite!

280
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,790
你和尼克分手没
Did you break up with Nick yet?

281
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,930
我分不了  他刚接了个特别不好的电话
I can't! He just got some horrible call.

282
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,140
我想大概是他家有亲戚死了之类的
I think a family member might have died or something.

283
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,490
太好了  太棒了
Oh! Yes! Yes!

284
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,560
一级好  一级棒
Yes! Yes! Yes!

285
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,580
我是说  罗宾没和他分手很棒
I mean, good that Robin can't dump him.

286
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,440
死人的事当然是很惨
The death part, less good.

287
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,200
罗宾  如果你和尼克分手
Robin, if you dump Nick,

288
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,900
他一怒之下  可能会把你上衣撕得粉碎
he could get mad and tear your blouse off.

289
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,490
然后一口咬在你脖子上
And then he bites you on the neck,

290
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,420
不是发狠地咬  而是介于
not super hard, just on the brink

291
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,930
快乐与痛楚边缘的那种咬
between pleasure and pain.

292
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,000
然后丹麦骚货纳迪亚
And then that Danish slut Nadia

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,020
冲入
bursts in...

294
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,790
你没时间了  他的腹沟伤马上就好了
You can't wait. His groin will heal

295
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,010
然后在不知不觉之间  你就会发现自己
and then before you know it, you'll be marrying a man

296
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,530
嫁给一个曾把香草味蜡烛都吃掉了的人
who once ate a vanilla-scented candle!

297
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,860
那件事错在我
That was on me.

298
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,380
我就不该把蜡烛放在厨房
I shouldn't have left it in the kitchen.

299
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,130
尽管那蜡烛还在烧  靠  这男的真蠢
Though, it was lit. Man, he dumb.

300
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,210
这份邀请将在五分钟后发送
The invite goes live in five minutes.

301
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,030
什么
What?!

302
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,000
这份邀请会自动发送  只有我能让它停下
It goes out automatically unless I stop it,

303
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,410
除非你在免提里甩了那个男人
and that only happens if I hear you dump Nick

304
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,650
否则我绝不按停
on speakerphone before then.

305
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,280
好吧
Fine.

306
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,460
尼克  抱歉抱歉
Hey, Nick. I'm sorry about that.

307
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,690
听我说
Um, listen,

308
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,830
有件事我需要
there's something I need

309
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,610
和你谈一谈
to talk to you about.

310
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,630
罗宾  抱歉  我刚没说完
No, Robin, I'm sorry. I'm like half here.

311
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,760
那通电话是
That phone call, it just...

312
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,350
我有坏消息要说
I got some really bad news.

313
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,160
我的医生帮我做了核磁共振图
My doctor did an MRI...

314
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,160
结果
and...

315
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,490
我的天  到底怎么了
Oh... Oh, God. What, what is it?

316
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,000
我的腹沟受伤情况比推测的严重
My groin injury is worse than they thought.

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,700
我好几周都不能打篮球了
I can't play basketball for weeks.

318
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,320
谢天谢地  我还以为他是要死了之类的
Thank God. I thought he was dying or something.

319
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,540
几周不能玩  到底几周不能玩
How many weeks? How many weeks?!

320
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,430
拜托  千万不要是
Please tell me it's not a tear

321
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,900
骼腰韧带拉伤
in the iliolumbar ligament.

322
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,760
我的骼腰韧带拉伤了
It's a tear in the "libioflumflar linament."

323
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,780
如果情况不严重  他还可以参加最后决赛
If it's a small tear, he can still make playoffs.

324
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,100
拉伤得相当严重
It's a big tear.

325
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,470
千万不要这一季都上不了场
He better not be out for the season.

326
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,370
-我这一季都上不了场了  -该死的
- I'm out for the season. - Damn it!

327
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,170
他们要独自对阵"算数能手"会计队了
They're going up against The Number Crunchers without me.

328
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,860
这不过是律师会计和爱缝纫的建筑师玩的
It's an after-work basketball league for lawyers

329
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,920
下班后篮球联赛
and accountants and architects who sew.

330
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,610
谁会这么看重这件事啊
I mean, who takes it that seriously?

331
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,240
老天爷啊
No...!

332
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,600
我只是不想让埃里克森教练失望
I just hate letting coach Eriksen down.

333
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,100
我愿意陪他一起上刀山下火海
I would follow that man through the gates of hell!

334
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,920
胜利
Winning.

335
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,990
几周前  当我们战胜了"算数能手"队时
What do we win when we beat those Number Crunchers

336
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,760
我们赢得了什么
a few short weeks hence?

337
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,420
一场比赛吗  这当然
A game? Sure.

338
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,570
一个奖杯吗  勉强算吧
A trophy? Sort of.

339
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,150
我们赢得了商店的25块礼品券
We win a $25 gift card to Bennigan's,

340
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,510
但我们真正赢得了什么
but what is it that we really win?

341
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,120
赢了比赛
The game!

342
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,470
-这我已经说过了  尼克  -是
- Yes, I said that Nick. - Right.

343
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,470
我们同时赢得了
But we also win

344
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,770
昂首阔步的权利
the right to walk tall.

345
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,750
赢得了敢于自称冠军的资格
The right to call ourselves champions.

346
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,890
所以我们要全力以赴
Yeah. So we are gonna go out and we are

347
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,100
把这群小会计打得溃不成军
gonna wipe the floor with those accountants!

348
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,250
赢得胜利之后  我们将会像君王一样
And afterwards, we will feast like kings

349
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,040
尽情享用西南铁板香料虾
on Southwest Fajitas and Cajun shrimp!

350
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,650
而饭钱  也会稍微地便宜一些
And that check, that check will be marginally less expensive!

351
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,970
-太好了  -太好了
- Yeah! - Yeah!

352
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,630
现在  他们大概不得不付全额的饭钱了
Now, they're probably gonna have to pay full price for that meal.

353
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,020
尼克  你人太好了  可我
Nick, you are so sweet, but I just...

354
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,530
好消息是
Good news is

355
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,440
反正我的腹沟都需要
it doesn't really matter if it takes my groin pull

356
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,580
长时间慢慢来恢复
a little longer to heal,

357
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,550
所以我又可以和你翻云覆雨了
so I may as well start having sex again.

358
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,420
我听着呢
Listening.

359
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,480
恶心着呢
Sickening.

360
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,100
狂奔出门着呢
Exiting.

361
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,360
尼克
Nick...

362
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,170
我只是
I just...

363
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,440
我
Ah... I...

364
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,860
你觉得如何
What do you think?

365
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,330
我觉得我突然想要来点火热的东西了
I think I am suddenly in the mood for something hot.

366
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,300
我懂了  看来我得点热的卡布奇诺了
I see. Sounds like I should order some cappuccinos.

367
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,550
明早之前都闭嘴别说话
Don't talk till tomorrow morning.

368
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,190
她不能和你一起回家  尼克
She can't go home with you, Nick.

369
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,070
-巴尼  -为什么呀
- Barney? - Why not?

370
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,140
因为罗宾和我深爱着彼此
Because Robin and I are in love.

371
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,020
巴尼  你来这里干什么啊
Barney, what are you doing here?

372
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,950
我是来解决某件
Taking care of something

373
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
你显然没法独自完成的任务的
you clearly can't do on your own.

374
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,360
抱歉
I'm sorry,

375
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,970
但你和罗宾没戏了
but you and Robin are done.

376
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,560
什么  罗宾  他什么意思
What? Robin, what is this?

377
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,020
巴尼  我知道你想干嘛
Barney, look, I-I know what you're doing, okay?

378
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,350
请别这样
Please stop.

379
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,830
罗宾不想伤害你的感情
Robin doesn't want to hurt your feelings

380
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,230
因为你这人不错
because you're a nice guy,

381
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,640
但她认为你很蠢  她讨厌你
but she thinks you're stupid and she hates you.

382
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,290
不用谢
You're welcome.

383
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,490
别这样
Stop doing this.

384
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,980
我爱她  尼克
I love her, Nick.

385
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,650
他不爱我
Look, he doesn't love me.

386
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,000
他这样说是因为...
He's just saying this because...

387
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,990
我爱她的一切
I love everything about her,

388
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,650
说出这种话  对我来说不容易
and I'm not a guy who says that lightly.

389
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,150
我这辈子对女人都是虚情假意
I'm a guy who has faked love his entire life.

390
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,800
我认为爱情只是
I thought love was just something

391
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,110
白痴才会有的感觉
idiots thought they felt,

392
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,390
但这个女人抓住了我的心
but this woman has a hold on my heart

393
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,720
就算我想挣脱也于事无补
that I could not break if I wanted to,

394
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,240
我不是没有试过摆脱对她的感觉
and there have been times that I wanted to.

395
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,380
我不知所措  任爱摆布    
It has been overwhelming and humbling

396
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,370
有时甚至心里好痛
and even painful at times,

397
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,050
但我没办法不爱她
but I could not stop loving her

398
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,540
就如同不能呼吸一样
any more than I could stop breathing.

399
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,780
我无可救药地  义无反顾地爱着她
I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her.

400
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,920
而她却不知道我的爱有这么深
More than she knows.

401
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,810
罗宾  这是真的吗
Robin, is this true?

402
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,350
你也听到啦
You heard him.

403
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,010
哇  感觉我心里
Oh, wow, it feels like I have

404
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,400
有一块被拉伤的腹股沟肌肉
a pulled groin muscle in my heart.

405
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
-尼克  真是对不起  -别
- Nick, I-I'm so sorry.- Don't.

406
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,560
我只觉得也许...
I just think that maybe...

407
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,200
打扰下
Pardon me.

408
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,790
你刚刚也心碎了吗
But did you just also get your heart broken?

409
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,710
碎了
Yes.

410
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,420
刚刚我的心也碎了
I just got my heart broken, too!

411
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,820
那么你们两个
Well, do the... the two of you...

412
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,730
想去我家吗
...want to come back to my place?

413
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,490
-想  -走吧
- Yes. - Come on.

414
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,040
<i>分手之秋就此结束了</i>
<i>Thus concluded the Autumn of Breakups,</i>

415
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,800
-够疯狂的  对吧  -是啊
- Crazy, right? - Yeah,

416
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,720
知道什么是真正的疯狂吗
you know what would be really crazy?

417
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,880
如果他们一起上
If all of 'em got it on--

418
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,630
巴尼  罗宾  尼克  那两个女人
Barney, Robin, Nick, and those two women,

419
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,420
纳迪亚也带着宠物蛇
and you just know Nadia's watching in the corner

420
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,780
在角落看着
with her pet snake.

421
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,580
够了  你俩为什么不做爱
Okay, why aren't you two having sex?

422
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,600
什么
What?

423
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,710
说什么呢
Excuse me?

424
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,250
莉莉垂涎罗宾的性生活
Lily has been slobbering over Robin's sex life

425
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,890
就像卡通里流浪汉  垂涎窗台上变凉的馅饼
like a cartoon hobo watching a pie cool on a windowsill,

426
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,770
至于你
and you--

427
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,450
唯一一次你这样玩命地锻炼
the only other time you've ever exercised this seriously

428
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,440
是莉莉大一时患了单核血球增多症
was when Lily had mono freshman year

429
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,110
被我撞到你做单手俯卧撑
and I caught you doing one-armed push-ups

430
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,670
而你老弟下面摆着一碗冰
with your genitals over a bowl of ice.

431
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,200
你们什么时候开始禁欲的  为什么
So, when did you stop doing it and why?

432
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,170
就是从
It was, you know,

433
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,360
马文出生前开始的
before Marvin was born.

434
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,980
什么  这太离谱了
What? Th-That's insane.

435
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,930
生孩子后要禁欲一段时间
Well, you have to wait a while after having a kid,

436
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,950
然后又因为整晚照顾孩子而精疲力竭
and, and then you're exhausted from being up all night.

437
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,650
然后一种诡异的现象出现了
And then this uncanny phenomenon began.

438
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,710
你们得解决这个问题
Wow, you guys got to fix this.

439
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

440
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,080
泰德  有了孩子一切都变了
Ted, having a kid changes things.

441
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,050
没有时间  没有精力  永远没有二人世界
You don't have the time or energy, you're never alone.

442
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,430
给我
Come here.

443
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,770
你干嘛
What are you doing?

444
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,490
带马文出去散步
Taking Marvin for a walk

445
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,940
给你们一点私人空间
so you guys can have some privacy.

446
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,650
泰德  得了
Oh, Ted, come on,

447
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,420
这样解决不了问题
that's, that's just not the way that it works.

448
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,280
我们又不能说做就做
Yeah, it's not like we can have sex on cue.

449
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,410
我会给你们很多时间
Yeah, I'll give you guys plenty of time.

450
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,460
我甚至可能
