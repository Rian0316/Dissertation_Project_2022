我結算了小蛋糕店的收銀機
Oh, I closed out the cupcake register.

31
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,490
這是掙來的房租錢
Here's our rent money.

32
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,490
錢拿去  信封袋還我
Gimme back the envelope though,

33
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,400
那袋子也是我的珠寶首飾盒
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

34
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,210
我也結算了收銀機
I closed out the register.

35
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,580
我這也有一份交房租的錢
I have our rent money.

36
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,850
麥克斯  你知道這代表什么嗎
Max, do you know what this means?

37
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,100
如果我腦子沒有被驢踢了
Unless I was hit in the head by a piece of farm equipment,

38
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,670
就表示咱們有盈余啦
it means we have extra money.

39
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,970
我好想來一段盈余慶祝舞
I wanna do the extra money dance,

40
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,850
但我們沒有這一套舞  
but we don't have one

41
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,780
因為我們的錢從沒有過盈余
because we've never had extra money!

42
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,550
我唯一會的掙錢[盈余]舞  
The only extra money dance I know

43
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,740
需要用到乒乓球
involves ping-pong balls

44
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,600
又名"十八招"  常由東南亞女性表演
由下陰"吞入""噴吐"乒乓球的成人表演

45
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,600
而我也久沒跳  技藝生疏了
and I'm really out of practice.

46
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,670
厄爾  我給你帶來了你的最愛
Earl, I brought you your favorite.

47
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,420
黑人華人混血肚皮舞女嗎
A half-black, half-Chinese belly dancer?

48
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,960
椰子味小蛋糕啦
A coconut cupcake.

49
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,390
你看卡洛琳
Look at Caroline over there.

50
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,190
使出渾身解數跟人調情
She's flirting harder with him

51
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,400
比我對抗心臟病還賣力
than I flirt with heart disease.

52
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,260
不許  不許說
Stop, stop!

53
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,390
人家才看到第一季第二集
I'm only on episode two of season one.

54
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,630
敢說人家打死你
I will kill you!

55
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,410
那...  下回分曉吧
Then... to be continued.

56
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,860
那就是還有下回咩
Oh! It's gonna be continued.

57
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,720
好呀  那我們下回分曉時
Well, then, we will continue this

58
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,490
再來下回分曉吧
when we continue this.

59
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
如果你盡全力就這程度
If that's your game,

60
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,130
那估計你這輩子都得跟姐住了  妹子
you're gonna be living with me forever, fran.

61
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,950
他已經連續三晚來我這區
He's been in my section three nights in a row

62
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,020
點火雞肉三明治了
for the turkey club.

63
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,040
我叫他"火雞三明治帥哥"
I'm calling him "the turkey club cutie".

64
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,280
聽得我想"叫救命"
I'm calling poison control.

65
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,910
我看他應該差不多要約我了
I think he's getting ready to ask me out.

66
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,330
他問我是不是住在附近
He wanted to know if I live around here

67
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,690
還問我幾點下班
and what time I get off.

68
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,650
一個愿意等到你下班[高潮]的男人
If a man's gonna wait for you to get off,

69
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,220
絕對要留住啊
he's a keeper.

70
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,830
那就...
So...

71
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,430
下次見啦
See you next time.

72
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,040
那我們就下次見啦
I will see you next time as well.

73
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,330
再見
Bye.

74
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,720
-那是什么  -不知道  我哪會知道
- What's that? - I don't know. How would I know?

75
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,160
因為是你頭上掉下來的啊
Because it came out of your head.

76
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,720
麥克斯  我才沒有去接發
I don't have hair extensions, Max.

77
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
好吧  那我拿去扔了
Okay, I'll throw it out.

78
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,490
別  下次能當故事說
No! I'll keep it for this story!

79
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,780
什么故事
What story?

80
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,380
某天晚上我們
The story about how we found

81
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,870
無緣無故發現一段金色接發的故事
a blonde hair extension out of nowhere that night.

82
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
超好笑啊
It's hilarious!

83
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,930
是比你大多數故事都好笑了
Well, it's already funnier than most of your stories.

84
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,060
你看  又一段"爆笑故事"
Oh, look, there's another hilarious story!

85
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,510
好啦  麥克斯  我得坦白件事
Okay, Max, I have a confession to make.

86
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,060
我有做過接發
I have hair extensions.

87
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,520
我也有件事想坦白
I also have a confession to make.

88
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,820
我在羅德島殺過人
I murdered a man in Rhode island.

89
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,100
我就接了幾段  讓頭發有點層次
I just have a few. It gives me volume.

90
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,460
可惜它不能讓你有點深度
Too bad it doesn't give you depth.

91
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,920
我現在得想辦法把它們重新接上
Now I have to go and try and reattach these.

92
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,870
這接發不應該這么容易掉啊
These weaves are supposed to last.

93
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,340
我真不敢"接"信會這樣
This is unbe-weave-able!

94
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,340
我在生菜里發現了這個
I found this in the lettuce.

95
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,080
里面有發現陰道避孕環嗎
Any sign of a nuva ring in there?

96
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,010
因為我的不見了
'Cause I can't find mine.

97
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,120
是卡洛琳在掉頭發吧
Caroline's losing her hair, isn't she?

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,090
她是不是生病了
Is she sick?

99
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,490
她是不是得了癌癥  得了大"C"[癌]
Does she have cancer, the big "C"?

100
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,370
才不是  小東西
No, little you.

101
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
她沒有"大C"  
She doesn't have the big "C".

102
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,770
她連"AA"罩杯都沒有
She barely has the double "A"s.

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,650
阿憨發現了你的頭發
Han found more of your hair.

104
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,380
他知道我接發的事了嗎
He knows about the extensions?

105
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,570
沒  他以為你得了癌癥
No, he thinks you have cancer.

106
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,060
那就好  沒人知道就好
Oh, good! So no one knows.

107
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,370
安安  姑娘們  今夜因我而性感啦
Hola, ladies! Your night just got sexier.

108
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,590
路易斯  你早就下班了
Luis, you punched out hours ago.

109
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,960
你這么晚還來餐廳干嘛
What are you doing here so late?

110
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,740
回基[家]的路上嗎
On your way homo?

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,830
牙尖嘴利呀  小賤人
Good one, hooker!

112
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,280
我在夜店跑攤
No, I'm between clubs.

113
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,100
馬戲夜店現在是直男吧了
Circus just became a straight club,

114
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,300
衛星夜店還得再等半小時  才會變成基吧
And satellite doesn't become a gay club for a half hour.

115
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,090
所以就來跟我兄弟奧列格喝杯雞尾酒啦
So...I'm here to have a cocktail with my bro Oleg.

116
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,550
路易斯  跟你說過他是直男了
Luis, we told you. Oleg is straight.

117
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,200
拜托  我在阿拉巴馬州也是直男
Oh, please! So am I in Alabama.

118
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,200
阿拉巴馬州反對同性戀
學校老師必須教導學生同性戀是違法的

119
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,070
他已經走了
Well, he left already.

120
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,990
我都跟他說我會來坐坐了
But I told him I was gonna stop by.

121
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,940
男人都這樣  懼怕親密感情
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

122
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,250
卡洛琳兒  趁我過來
Oh, Carolina, while I'm here...

123
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,640
順便把我上班發現的東西還你
This is yours. I found it during my shift.

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,510
我沒拿走的小費嗎
Ooh, tips from my tables?

125
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,890
是你沒收好的頭發
More like hair from your head.

126
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,320
我就知道你那頭秀發不可能是真的
I knew this was all too good to be true.

127
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,110
你做了接發
You have extensions.

128
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,600
不是  我是得了癌癥
No, I have cancer.

129
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,470
屁咧  你做了接發  少唬我
No, you have extensions. Good try.

130
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,950
回見
Later!

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,550
看出我有何改變嗎
Hey. Notice anything different?

132
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,390
我用小店盈余去弄了新接發
I took some of the extra money and got new hair extensions.

133
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,590
我還給你準備了份禮物  放你房里了
And I also got you a surprise. I put it in your room.

134
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,590
去看看
Go look!

135
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,860
我感興趣的只有大肚豬
I'm not interested unless it's a potbelly pig

136
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,670
打扮成早期移民的大肚豬
or a potbelly pig in a pilgrim costume,

137
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,360
或打扮成大肚豬的早期移民
or a pilgrim in a potbelly pig costume,

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,790
或大麻[肚]
or just pot.

139
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,220
提示  我放在你床上哦
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.

140
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,120
覺得如何  愛不愛啊
What do you think? Do you love?

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,920
為啥這坨屎會在我床上
Okay... why is all this crap on my bed?

142
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,320
這他媽是什么玩意啊
And what the hell is it?

143
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,740
這是床裙啊
That's a bed skirt.

144
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,480
我的床才不要穿裙子  它是大老爺們
My bed doesn't wear skirts. It's a dude!

145
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,820
看它在我睡覺時從背后頂我  就知道是爺們 
I know, because it pokes me in the back while I'm asleep.

146
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,660
我幫你買了新寢具
I got you new bedding,

147
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,720
幫自己買了套新法蘭絨睡衣
and me some cute new flannel jammies.

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
上面還有埃菲爾鐵塔的圖案
They have eiffel towers on them.

149
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,750
大家都討厭法國人  所以這衣服超便宜的
They were marked down because everybody hates French people.

150
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,810
這上面連"污漬"都沒有
These don't even have stains!

151
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,230
這樣我怎么知道哪邊是上面
How am I gonna know which is the top now?

152
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,540
麥克斯  這有啥不好
Max, what's the problem?

153
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,000
你的舊床單都用多久了
You've had those old sheets forever.

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,870
你連替換的都沒有
You don't even have a spare set.

155
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,960
替換的床單
A spare set of sheets?

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,270
你當我誰啊  英國女皇嗎
Who am I, the queen of England?

157
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,820
你真沒勁  氣得我都想扯頭發了
You're so frustrating, I'd pull my hair out...

158
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,100
但我怕不小心扯到接發
But I'm not sure which of it is mine.

159
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,480
你看  這下你高興了嗎
Look! Look! Are you happy?

160
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,900
栗寶都不開心了  他知道我們吵架
Chestnut's upset. He knows we're fighting.

161
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,790
很好  
Good!

162
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,890
是該讓他知道哪天他出門買包薯片
He should know that if he goes out for a bag of chips,

163
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,810
很可能一回來
he could come home to find

164
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,270
就發現他的馬鞍被換成丁字褲了
you replaced his saddle with a thong.

165
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
我可是送你禮物呢
I got you a present.

166
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,670
你會氣圣誕老人嗎
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus?

167
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,630
他是誰啊
Who's that?

168
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,100
求你了  麥克斯
Max, please.

169
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,980
做點改變  睡在好寢具上面嘛
Just for a change, try sleeping on something nice.

170
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,330
行
Fine!

171
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,010
但我要真想睡在好寢具上面
But if I wanted to sleep on something nice,

172
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,080
我就跟那個搬回家照顧
I would have hooked up with that guy

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,030
生病老母親的男人走就好了
who moved home to take care of his sick mother.

174
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,380
小心提防啊  栗寶
Watch your back, Chestnut.

175
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,390
防火防盜防小人
Watch your back.

176
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,620
你個賤人  我的舊寢具呢
Where are my old sheets, bitch?

177
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
為什么
Why?

178
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,690
為什么要大半夜罵我賤人
Why are you calling me a "bitch" at night?

179
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,100
人家穿著新睡衣睡覺呢
I was sleeping in my new jammies.

180
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,830
沒我的舊寢具我睡不著
Well, I can't sleep without those sheets.

181
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,240
你所有抽屜我都看過了  你藏哪去了
So where are they? I checked all your drawers.

182
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,030
對了
And by the way,

183
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,280
誰會把電動棒收星巴克杯子里啊
Who hides their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

184
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,780
明知故問  我繼續睡覺了
You already know the answer, so I'm going back to sleep.

185
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,500
為什么呀
Why!

186
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,890
為什么穿著新睡衣的我會在地上
Why am I on the floor in my new jammies?

187
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,480
到底放哪去了
Where are they?

188
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,010
不在我這  我送給窮人了
I don't have them. I gave them to the poor.

189
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,470
你從窮人那里偷過去的
You took them from the poor!

190
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,370
現在窮人想討回來
And the poor wants them back.

191
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,390
已經遲了
Well, it's too late.

192
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,950
我放到救世軍的慈善捐助箱了
I put them in the Salvation Army donation bin.

193
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,810
那起來  你得去軍中一趟了  賤婦
Well, get up. You're going to the army, bitch.

194
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,610
為什么呀
Whyyyy?

195
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,260
為什么我們大半夜得跑來這里
Why are we here in the middle of the night?

196
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,760
我們要干嘛
What are we doing?

197
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
就在這了  跟我過來
Here it is. Come on, follow me.

198
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,410
麥克斯  你要在這殺我嗎
Max, is this where you kill me?

199
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,960
我一直都知道會有這么一天
'Cause I always knew it was gonna happen,

200
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
但我不知何時會發生
I just didn't know when.

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,930
但這里很有那感覺啊
This feels right though.

202
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,440
我是應該宰了你
I should kill you.

203
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,120
那套寢具對我有很特別的意義好嗎
Those sheets were really special to me, okay?

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,080
你在上面失去貞操的嗎
Oh, did you lose your virginities on them?

205
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,960
我不在床上做愛  那是我吃飯的地方
I don't have sex in beds. That's where I eat.

206
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,050
卡洛琳  我有件事要坦白
Caroline, I have a confession.

207
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,680
-什么事  -你有接發
- What is it? - You have hair extensions.

208
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,400
好啦  我說  但你不許看我
Okay, I'll tell you, but look away.

209
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,470
重點是那個枕套  我小時候就開始用了
It's the pillowcase. I've had it since I was a kid.

210
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,300
它又軟又有觸感
It's like soft and nubby

211
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,550
還有邊邊  我可以摸
and it had this edge that I'd like...rub,

212
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,430
在倒霉的日子  也就是每一天
and it relaxed me when things were crappy,

213
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,230
都能讓我放松
which was all the time.

214
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,410
我需要那個枕套才能睡著
I guess I still need that pillowcase to sleep or whatever.

215
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,300
麥克斯  你好可憐哦
Max, that's so sad.

216
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
當然可憐啊
Of course it's sad!

217
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,830
我有過歡樂童話故事嗎
When has it ever been a happy tale?

218
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,180
好啦  我得爬進去
All right, I need to crawl in here.

219
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,150
麥克斯  你要爬進這臟箱子啊
Max, you're just gonna crawl into that dirty box?

220
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,550
我們都不知道這箱子有多臟
We don't know where that bin's been.

221
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,240
對了
By the way,

222
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,430
"臟箱子"[臟貨]也是我當年在學校的綽號 
"dirty box" was my nickname in continuation school.

223
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,720
幫忙一下
I need help.

224
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,700
你是要我踩你背上  還是踩你的頭
Would you rather I step on your back or your head?

225
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,330
想都別想  這么貴的頭會給你踩嗎
My head? Hardly. Not at these prices.

226
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,730
來吧  十根手指伸出來
Come on, gimme ten fingers.

227
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,280
給過了
I already did.

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
來的路上伸過十次中指
Behind your back while we were walking here.

229
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,050
是讓你這樣  我就能踩著上去
No, like this, so I can step into it.

230
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,570
就跟個手指籃子一樣
You know, like a finger basket.

231
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,600
手指籃[裝蛋蛋]
Finger basket?

232
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,100
那是你的另一個綽號嗎
Is that another nickname of yours?

233
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,720
不是  但某年夏天本來可以的
No, but for one summer, it could've been.

234
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,870
那算了  來幫忙搬東西讓我踩吧
Forget this, just let me pull this stuff over.

235
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,490
麥克斯  我覺得我們一直在突破下限
Max, I feel like we're not even acknowledging

236
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,350
下限都成路人了
our low points anymore.

237
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,570
麥克斯  千萬小心
Okay, Max, now be very careful.

238
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,530
等我數到...
And on the count of...

239
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,240
你完全能當體操員啊
Wow! You could've been a great gymnast,

240
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,170
如果你有錢  有教練  做了縮胸手術的話
if you'd had money, coaches, and a breast reduction.

241
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,710
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

242
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,400
麥克斯
Max?

243
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,540
發點聲音出來啊
Gonna need some voice contact.

244
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,190
吾路不孤
I'm not in here alone.

245
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,910
你說吾路不孤是個什么意思
What do you mean you're not alone?

246
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,970
意思是  里面不只我一個人
I mean, I'm not in here alone.

247
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,160
別慌  我馬上救你出來
Stay calm! I will get you out of there.

248
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,780
不  我做不到
No, I won't.

249
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,530
我在找打開門的把手
I'm looking for a lever on the inside.

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,250
滾出我家
Get outta my house!

251
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,840
我只是想看看你是不是壓在我的枕套上
I just wanna check and see if you're on my pillowcase.

252
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
-別啊  麥克斯  -我要我親愛的寢具
- Max, no! - I need my sweet sheets!

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,390
放棄吧
Let it go.

254
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,090
如果被他壓在身下了  那也不親不愛了
If your sheets are under there, they're no long sweet.

255
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,550
滾出我家
Get outta my house!

256
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,960
關上門
Close the door!

257
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,690
行行行
Okay! Okay!

258
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,100
真是的  咱倆也算睡過了  真無情
God, sheez. You'd think we'd slept together.

259
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,930
這下我得怎么辦
What am I gonna do?

260
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,620
沒那套寢具我就睡不著
I can't sleep without those sheets.

261
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,290
我恨死你了
I'm so angry at you!

262
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,010
要不是發現這件好奶罩  我會更氣
I'd be even angrier if I hadn't found this great bra.

263
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,820
你想睡覺為啥還要來蘇菲家
Why are you going to Sophie's if you're trying to sleep?

264
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,960
她是我們認識最大嗓門的人了
She's the loudest person we know.

265
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,100
電影院里愛喧嘩的黑人都嫌她吵
Even black people at the movies tell Sophie to be quiet.

266
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,500
我來她家是想要個安眠藥
I am going to Sophie's to get a sleeping pill.

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,060
也就是她口中的"晚安糖"
Or as she likes to call them, "night candy".

268
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,780
你不需要吃安眠藥
You don't need a pill.

269
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,490
我有一招很棒的入眠方法
Listen, I have a great sleep technique

270
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,660
是我的睡眠教練教我的
that my sleep coach taught me.

271
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,610
我也跟一堆教練"睡"過
I have slept with my fair share of coaches,

272
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,480
他們的唯一用處就是讓我不能睡
and if anything, they kept me awake.

273
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,090
麥克斯  凌晨三點
Max, it's 3:00 A.M.

274
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,760
正常人應該都睡了
Any normal person is sleeping right now.

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,410
姑娘們
Hi, girls.

276
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,020
我一邊聽貓王  一邊拼拼圖呢
Just doing a puzzle and listening to Elvis.

277
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,900
趁你們還沒累累  先來杯酒酒吧
You two want a mai tai before you get too ty-ty?

278
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,860
不用了  但說到累累
No, thanks, but speaking of ty-ty,

279
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,460
我想問你要一顆安眠藥
I was hoping I could snag one of your sleeping pills.

280
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,410
沒問題  我能給你  
Oh, sure, I can hook you up.

281
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,770
我從來不用
I never use them.

282
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,840
我晚上都只需要睡三小時
I only need three hours of sleep at night

283
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,230
白天再睡個六小時  進來吧
and six during the day. Come on.

284
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,040
蘇菲
Sophie...

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,460
發現哪里是新的嗎
Notice anything new?

286
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,770
有啊
Oh! Yeah!

287
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,630
你頭上接了更多頭發嗎
You planted more hair on your head.

288
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,950
我聽說了
I heard.

289
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,220
麥克斯  你居然告訴她
Max! You told her?

290
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,990
沒  這事都上新聞聯播了
No, it was on CNN.

291
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,190
先報導了敘利亞的新聞
They led with Syria,

292
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,820
然后連續報道了五分鐘你頭發的事
and then did a solid five on your hair.

293
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,580
來啦  藥跟香料
Here we go-- pills and spices!

294
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,820
你有滿香料架的藥嗎
You have a spice rack full of pills?

295
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,300
改天下廚做頓晚餐請我吃吧
You gotta cook me dinner sometime.

296
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
我看看
Let's see.

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,500
魚油  盤尼西林  阿莫西林
Fish oil, penicillin, amoxicillin...

298
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,580
彩虹糖
Skittles.

299
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,310
這是我的德國神藥
Oh, and this is my German pill

300
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,370
哪天核彈大爆發  還是我被放逐外星時吃
in case they release the bombs or I'm ever abandoned in space.

301
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,310
給  麥克斯  睡個好覺
Here you go, Max. Nighty-night.

302
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,490
這樣吧
Oh, you know what?

303
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,100
管這么多干嘛  老娘也來一粒
What the hell! I'm gonna have one too.

304
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,290
這是睡衣派對
It's a slumber party!

305
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,480
你又有另一架子[胸部]的藥了
Oh, now you got another rack full of pills.

306
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,720
算了吧
Oh, you know what?

307
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,310
別等我了  麥克斯  估計得找一會
Don't wait for me, Max. This might be a while.

308
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,750
麥克斯  你真的得靠藥物嗎
Max, do you really need to take that?

309
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,040
吃完安眠藥  很多人會做怪事
People do weird things on sleeping pills.

310
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,750
我一個朋友
My friend Candice Travelstead

311
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,130
夢游用奶油涂滿皮夾  還打算吃下去
buttered a wallet and tried to eat it.

312
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,980
別擔心  我沒皮夾
Don't worry, I don't have a wallet.

313
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,820
等等  等等
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

314
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,450
你那顆是安眠藥
Is that the sleeping pill,

315
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,290
還是我的緊急自殺太空藥
or is that my emergency space pill that kills you?

316
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,250
兩種都能讓我閉眼安眠
Either way, I'll get some shut-eye.

317
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,110
麥克斯  不許
Max, no!

318
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,120
不許你拋下我一人在這世界上
You are not gonna die and leave me here alone.

319
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
在沒有監護人帶領的情況下  我還沒搞懂
I still don't know how to go east on the "L" Train

320
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,830
怎么坐L火號車去東邊
without a chaperone.

321
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,650
麥克斯  現在是凌晨3點30分
Max, it's 3:30 A.M.,

322
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,430
睡眠教練卡洛琳
and sleep coach Caroline here

323
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,510
最晚能讓你在3點45分安然入睡哦
will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

324
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,270
你不是應該泡個熱水澡嗎
You're supposed to be taking a hot bath.

325
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,930
本來是  但當我把塞子塞進去時
I was, but when I put the stopper in,

326
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,000
有東西又把它給頂出來了
something pushed it back out again.

327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,050
藥片在哪里
Where's that pill?

328
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,610
我藏在身上呢
I've got it on my person,

329
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,760
如果這些都不管用  我就把它給你
and if this doesn't work I'll give it to you.

330
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,360
為了藥片  整只手伸入你洞內找
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill.

331
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,890
我都會做哦
And don't think I won't.

332
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,330
麥克斯  這是你的新寢具
Max, meet your new sheets.

333
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,550
新寢具  這是...
New sheets, meet--

334
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,380
用不著互相介紹  我又不是神經病人
Don't make me meet the sheets. I'm not a mental patient.

335
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,340
如果我是  那住的地方會比這好多了
If I was, I'd be living in a much nicer place.

336
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,420
而且我所有的枕套都會有花邊
And all my pillowcases would have edges.

337
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,040
哇  你的枕套居然有花邊啊
Wow, even your pillowcase had an edge.

338
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,550
你的枕套到底是什么樣的
What was it like anyway?

339
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,450
就像是你新睡衣下面那樣
It was kinda like the end of your new PJs,

340
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,030
但你的睡衣是我見過最基的東西
but not the queerest thing I've ever seen.

341
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,170
還點蠟燭  你以為我們是女巫嗎
A candle? What are we, witches?

342
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,030
現在想象自己處在一個輕松美麗的地方
Now, imagine yourself in a relaxed, beautiful place.

343
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,330
讓呼吸自由進出
Breathe in and out.

344
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,550
吸氣  呼氣
In and out.

345
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,480
聽著  手指籃姑娘唯一了解的事情
Look, if there's one thing old finger basket know how to do

346
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,420
那就是"進跟出"
it's in and out.

347
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,560
把藥片給我
Gimme the pill.

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,690
我還沒說完呢
I'm not finished yet.

349
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,490
但先提醒你
But just so you know,

350
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,370
那顆藥片在一個小時里變色了三次了
that pill has changed colors three times in the last hour.

351
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,410
要么會吃死人  要么就是五彩糖球
So it's either deadly, or an Everlasting Gobstopper.

352
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,580
我真是被你氣死了  你就拿走我唯一一樣
I am so mad at you. You took my one thing.

353
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,930
我生命中有特別意義的東西
That pillowcase was my one special thing.

354
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,920
我的人生中  人們從我身邊拿走了很多東西
In my whole life of people taking things away from me,

355
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
唯有那個枕套從來沒人會拿
that was the one thing no one took,

356
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,170
而現在我再也睡不著了
and now I'm never gonna sleep again.

357
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,480
我愛睡覺
And I love sleeping.

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,640
做夢是我離有線電視最接近的時刻了
Dreaming is the closest thing I have to cable TV.

359
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,380
夠了  麥克斯
Enough, Max!

360
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,410
在你對"一張床單"[屎]過分依賴的事情上
I've been very patient with this weird attachment you have

361
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,660
我已經夠耐心了
to this little piece of sheet.

362
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,930
你才是"一坨屎"呢
You're a piece of sheet.

363
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,000
在我失去一切時  我懂得兩個道理
Listen, if I learned anything when I lost everything,

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,970
那就是  第一  
It's that, "A," there's no wiggle room

365
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,050
白干酪的保質期限說到就到了
when it comes to cottage cheese expiration dates,

366
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,220
第二  你不能過于依賴物質事物
And "B," You can't get attached to material things.

367
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
得了吧  接發不算嗎
Okay, extensions.

368
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,500
這話什么意思
What does that mean?

369
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,230
意思就是準確來說
It means that your material things

370
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,480
你依賴的事物粘了你滿腦袋
are literally attached to your head.

371
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,540
完全不一樣好嗎
Not the same thing at all.

372
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,670
你滿腦子都是你對那個枕套的依賴
Your dependency on that pillowcase is all in your head,

373
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,730
而你卻不需要它
you don't need it.

374
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,230
那你也不需要這個
Oh. You don't need this.

375
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,840
你欠我14塊
You owe me $14.

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,490
先記賬吧
Run a tab.

377
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,500
我才不要坐在這里忍受你的侮辱
I'm not about to sit here and take this abuse

378
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,980
就因為你對一個枕套有著病態的依賴心理
because you have an unhealthy attachment to a pillowcase.

379
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,810
晚安  馬里布芭比
Good night, Malibu Barbie.

380
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,380
希望你不是想要侮辱我
I hope you're not trying to insult me,

381
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,190
因為你這話是在贊美我
because she's gorgeous!

382
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,370
對了  鄭重聲明
And for the record,

383
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,640
我對我的頭發才沒有什么病態的依賴心理
I do not have an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

384
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
是嗎
Oh, really.

385
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,100
你個禽獸
You're a monster!

386
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,040
對不起  人家睡不著嘛
I'm sorry, I can't sleep.

387
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,110
只要你把藥片給我  我就沒事了
I'll be fine. Just give me the pill.

388
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,340
只是你心理作用
No! It's all in your head!

389
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,700
快去睡覺
Go to sleep!

390
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,460
我用繩子把門把和我的床綁到一起
I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope

391
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,320
然后把臥室所有的窗戶都關上了
and locked all the bedroom windows.

392
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,500
你是想傷害我  還是想讓我欲火焚身啊
Are you trying to hurt me or turn me on?

393
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
你要做好心理準備  厄爾
Brace yourself, Earl.

394
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,640
麥克斯今天上班的心情不會太好哦
When Max gets here, she will not be in a good mood.

395
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,110
卡洛琳  如果我想跟一群天天好心情的人共事
Caroline, if I wanted to work around people in a good mood,

396
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,450
我早去谷歌上班了
I'd go work at Google.

397
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,060
她從昨天開始就睡不著
She hasn't slept since yesterday

398
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,900
因為我不愿意給她安眠藥  她現在超級火大
and is furious because I won't give her a sleeping pill.

399
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,170
明智之舉
Smart move.

400
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,230
安眠藥只會把人搞得更糟
Sleeping pills mess you up.

401
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,470
我曾經吃過一次  結果在一天后醒來
I took one once, woke up a day later

402
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,520
發現自己科尼島的云霄飛車上
on the roller coaster ride in Coney Island.

403
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,820
我喜歡云霄飛車
I love roller coasters.

404
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,310
但得是坐在座位里我才喜歡啊
Me too, when I'm in a seat.

405
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,540
你們好啊
Oh, hello!

406
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,080
你們倆今晚好嗎
How are you two tonight?

407
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,090
天啊  她太友善了
Oh, no. She's nice.

408
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,770
她肯定從哪里搞到安眠藥了
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

409
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,470
不  我沒吃藥  只是想明白了
No. No pills. Just had some clarity.

410
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,180
-請跟我來  -好吧
- Follow me, please. - Oh, okay.

411
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,090
你是"抽"明白了  還是"吸"明白了
Did you smoke or snort this clarity?

412
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,960
既然你這么好  送我新床單
Yeah, since you were nice enough to get me new sheets,

413
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,220
我也有東西作為回禮  給
I got you something in return. Here.

414
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,260
這是表示歉意的同時
Oh, is this like an apology,

415
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,830
兼表示謝意嗎
thank you kind of thing?

416
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,730
給我看好了
Now watch.

417
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,000
人接受禮物時就應該這么優雅
This is how one graciously accepts a gift.

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,420
這是啥玩意啊
What the hell is this?

419
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,300
假發
A wig?

420
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,780
不然就是你剝了80年代拉拉的頭皮
Either that or you scalped a lesbian from the '80s.

421
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,700
是的  我一把抓住她的波洛領帶
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie

422
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,730
然后爬上她的墊肩[當年流行]
and climbed up on her shoulder pads.

423
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,910
你奪走讓我有安全感的東西
You took away my security thing--

424
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,980
我的枕套
the pillowcase--

425
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,780
所以現在我要奪走讓你有安全感的東西
So now I'm taking away your security thing--

426
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,930
你的頭發
your hair.

427
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,200
你今晚可以戴著那玩意
You can wear that on your head tonight

428
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,450
然后告訴我一切都只是心理作用可以克服
and then tell me again how this is all in my head.

429
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,680
你非得買人家店里最丑的那一頂嗎
Did you have to get the ugliest one they had?

430
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,180
3毛7的東西  你還想要求什么
What do you want for 37 cents?

431
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,000
好吧  我會把這個爛玩意頂頭上
Fine! I'll put this roadkill on my head

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,830
向你證明  我的價值不只是這頭秀發
Just to prove to you that I am so much more than my hair.

433
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,880
還有我的態度  心靈  大腦和勇氣
I am my attitude, my spirit, my brain, my bravery.

434
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,770
-戴上它  -麥克斯  我好害怕
- Put it on. - Max, I'm scared.

435
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,410
快  把劉海撥到后面[從后面搞]
Go. The bangs go in the back.

436
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,440
我就喜歡這種女人
That's my kinda woman.

437
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,560
科布沙拉  上菜
Cobb salad, pick-up!

438
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,060
蘇菲
Uh...hey, Sophie.

439
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,210
你是知道有黑手黨寡婦折扣  才穿著這樣嗎
Are you here for the mafia widow discount?

440
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,630
厄爾  我在保持低調
Earl, I'm incognito.

441
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,260
偷偷來給麥克斯送藥的
I'm making a drug drop for Max.

442
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,410
麥克斯  你的藥[毒品]來了
Hey, Max! I got your drugs!

443
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,220
謝啦
Thanks.

444
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,640
我愛死你永遠能找到一套
And I love that you have an outfit

445
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,660
適合我讓你干的事的衣服
for everything I ask you to do.

446
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,970
那個金發緝毒特警呢  麥克斯
Where's the blonde narc, Max?

447
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,200
天啊
Oh, my God!

448
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,890
卡洛琳加入保齡球隊了嗎
Did Caroline join a bowling team?

449
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,550
麥克斯  不行
Max! No!

450
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,110
糟糕
Aw, crap!

451
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,600
被羅德·斯圖爾特逮個正著
Rod Stewart just busted us.

452
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,600
英國老派搖滾歌手  發型類似

453
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,780
讓她爽一下吧  有啥大不了的  老古板
Let her have some fun. What's the big deal, square?

454
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,490
因為她覺得自己需要這藥的理由
The big deal is that Max thinks she needs these pills

455
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,580
是因為我丟了她的小被被
because I threw away her blankie.

456
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,120
那是個枕套  有它我才能睡著
It was a pillowcase, and I need it to sleep.

457
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,770
她得摸著才能睡
She has to rub it.

458
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,420
在波蘭
In Poland,

459
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,770
我也有樣小東西
I had this little thing that I liked to tickle

460
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,610
喜歡在睡覺前玩
before I went to sleep.

461
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,920
但也被我姨母扔了
But my aunt threw it away.

462
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,570
那是什么
What was it?

463
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,510
我的諾拉表妹
It was my cousin Nora.

464
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,540
-把藥給我  -不要  
- Give me the pills. - Nope.

465
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,990
麥克斯  你是錯的  瞧我
And, Max, you were wrong. See?

466
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,140
我一點都不依賴我的頭發
I'm not attached to my hair.

467
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,430
老實說  我開始愛上我的新發型
In fact, I am loving my new look.

468
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,210
我是個懶得打扮的單親母親
Am I a single mom trying to keep it simple?

469
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,880
或是助理地方檢察官呢
Am I an assistant D.A. in over my head?

470
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,420
又或是邦·喬飛故事里的查理茲·塞隆
Or am I Charlize Theron in the Jon Bon Jovi story?

471
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,580
或許吧  我完全不介意
Maybe, and I'm fine with it.

472
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,720
因為我一點也不看重我的頭發
'cause I am not my hair.

473
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,710
天啊  火雞三明治帥哥  掩護我
Oh, my god, turkey club cutie! Hide me!

474
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,720
戴著難看的假發  雙膝跪地
On your knees in a bad wig.

475
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,730
姑娘  我也有過這樣的經歷
Listen, girl, I've been there.

476
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,830
不  我只是不想被人看見
No, I just don't wanna be seen.

477
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,090
卡洛琳  卡洛琳  我愛你
Caroline, Caroline, I love you,

478
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,180
但我聽不下去了
But I can't hear anymore.

479
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,280
這頂假發即使在70年代  也讓人不忍直視
That hair was hard enough to look at in the '70s.

480
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,670
好吧  你是對的  我是錯的
Fine! You were right, I was wrong.

481
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,070
幫我把假發脫下來  我不能讓他見我這樣
Now help me get this off. He can't see me like this.

482
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,780
沒錯  把藥給我
That's right, gimme the pills.

483
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,170
麥克斯  不  你不需要
Max, no. You don't need them.

484
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,450
我們都不知道這藥哪來的
We don't know where they've been.

485
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,890
好吧
Fine!

486
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,510
那我回家睡覺
I'm going home to try to sleep.

487
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,080
既然這都是你的錯  那你來替我上班吧
Since this is all your fault, you can finish my shift.

488
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,840
你自己上班吧
You're on your own,

489
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,550
80年代肥皂劇那個住在對面街的女人
lady who lived across the street from Al Bundy

490
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,910
不得不說  我真佩服我自己也能接發
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed I can do this.

491
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,900
其實沒那么難嘛
It's not so hard.

492
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,440
我不懂錢妮絲干嘛老抱怨
I don't know what Chanice is always bitching about.

493
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,780
或許她就是個愛抱怨的賤人吧
I guess that's who she is.

494
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,490
真不敢相信我到現在還沒睡著
I can't believe I still haven't slept.

495
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,250
我這輩子都別想睡覺了
I'm gonna be awake forever.

496
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
最后會像那部電影《喚醒》  但我是想睡死過去
It's gonna be like that movie Awakenings, but not at all.

497
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
電影講述的是一名醫生在偶然的機會通過一種尚未通過臨床研究的藥物
使得病人走出了幾十年的夢境

498
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,160
麥克斯  你可以摸我
Max, you can rub me.

499
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,460
哇  那頂拉拉假發把你掰彎啦
Wow, that wig changed you.

500
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,840
不  是這里
No, here.

501
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
摸我睡衣下面的花邊
Rub the edge on the bottom of my jammie top

502
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,710
-把它當成是你的枕套  -不要
- like it's your pillowcase. - No.

503
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,350
如果我摸你睡衣的下面
If I rub the bottom of your jammies,

504
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,600
那我就會變成無下限
that would be my bottom.

505
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,900
火雞三明治帥哥沒有約我出去
Turkey club cutie didn't ask me out,

506
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,310
可能是因為我的頭發被假發弄得太亂了
probably because my hair was so messed up from the wig.

507
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,650
別對自己那么苛刻
Don't be so hard on yourself.

508
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,050
也有可能是討厭你性格啊
it could've been your personality too.

509
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,760
你真的覺得他是因為頭發才喜歡你嗎
You really think he only liked you for your hair?

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,120
反正我是
I only like me for my hair.

511
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,620
早說了吧  你就是愛它
Told you. You're attached to it.

512
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,720
我超級愛我的頭發
So attached to it!

513
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,450
用手轉著玩  甩著玩  翻著玩
Twirling it, tossing it, flipping it.

514
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,500
在我的脖子  肩膀還有后背感覺它
Feeling it on my neck, on my shoulders, on my back.

515
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
沒有光滑發髻的卡洛琳·錢寧
Caroline Channing without the option

516
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,990
就不是卡洛琳·錢寧了
of a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing.

517
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,070
對不起啦
And I'm sorry.

518
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,980
很抱歉我因為
I'm sorry I judged you

519
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,420
你對某物過于依賴而批評你
for having an attachment to something

520
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,100
而我也沒好到哪去
when I'm no better.

521
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,360
抱歉我把你親愛的寢具扔了
And I'm sorry I got rid of your sweet sheets.

522
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,190
麥克斯
Max.

523
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,830
麥克斯
Max?

524
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,860
晚安  麥克斯
Night, Max.

525
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,390
為什么啊
Whyyyy?

526
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,050
為什么我就不能擁有點好東西呢
Why can't I ever have anything nice?
