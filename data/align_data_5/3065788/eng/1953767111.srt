1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:02,901
My brothers and I
are the first vampires.

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:06,367
In all of history...
The Originals.

3
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:09,904
300 years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:13,459
Now we've returned
to find a city at war.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,461
The vampire Marcel leads an army

6
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:18,914
against a coven
of desperate witches.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,251
My brother Klaus
is playing against both sides,

8
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:24,587
hungry for power

9
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:28,090
and hoping to protect
the werewolf carrying his child,

10
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,059
but Marcel has an advantage.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,844
He holds our brother
Elijah captive

12
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,230
with the aid of a secret weapon.

13
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,233
Now in order to get back
the brother I love,

14
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:41,270
I have no choice but to side
with the one I cannot trust.

15
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:45,557
August 1359.

16
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,443
I have noticed a difference

17
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,994
in my siblings.

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,565
Our bond strains beneath
the pressure

19
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,869
of our life as vampires.

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,904
Each day removes them further
from the humanity

21
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,956
they once possessed.

22
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:03,292
My sweet sister Rebekah

23
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,743
has grown quite indifferent
to brutality.

24
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:12,300
However, the true problem
remains by brother Niklaus.

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:19,390
He continues to hide
his loneliness with cruelty.

26
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:24,563
Still, I cling to the hope
that I, as their eldest brother,

27
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:27,283
can lead them
down the correct path,

28
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:31,936
a path charged with the power
of a family united...

29
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:36,575
For if I fail,

30
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:40,329
our family's legacy will end
in darkness.

31
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,413
I cannot
believe you disposed

32
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,132
of those vampires
without me.

33
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,217
You know how I love
to set things on fire.

34
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,218
Was I supposed
to leave them

35
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,087
in the front yard
to rot?

36
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:50,172
Besides, they were
my responsibility.

37
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,091
They attacked the helpless,
pregnant girl

38
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,726
who's carrying
my child.

39
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,061
Oh, I am so moved

40
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,846
by your newfound sense
of fatherly duty

41
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,098
towards the werewolf
carrying

42
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,432
your hybrid bun
in her oven.

43
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,599
Ha!

44
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:05,938
The werewolf would like
to know what the plan is.

45
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,240
Well, that depends
what plan you mean, luv...

46
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,225
My plan
for global domination

47
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:13,245
or Rebekah's plan to find love
in a cruel, cruel world.

48
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:14,580
Hmm.

49
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,783
The plan
to rescue Elijah,

50
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,584
you know...
The good brother,

51
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,953
the one who is now
in the possession

52
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:22,788
of your mortal enemy
after you stabbed him

53
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,173
in the back.

54
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,258
In the front,
if we're being specific.

55
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,743
You two said that
you would get him back.

56
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:30,546
So is there
a plan, or what?

57
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:32,381
Ok.

58
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:36,719
Well, firstly, Marcel
is not my mortal enemy.

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,637
He's my friend,
albeit one

60
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:41,273
who is unaware that I
am trying to sabotage

61
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,309
his hold over
the supernatural community

62
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,526
of the French quarter,
but a friend nonetheless,

63
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:48,447
and secondly,
I daggered Elijah

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,199
in order to gain
Marcel's trust.

65
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,068
If I had known he would
place my brother

66
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,571
in the hands of a particularly
nasty teenage witch,

67
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:57,156
I certainly would have
weighed my options

68
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,875
a bit differently,
and thirdly, sister, please.

69
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,161
And thirdly, the plan,
as you have demanded,

70
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,962
is for Niklaus to
simply asks Marcel

71
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,831
for Elijah back.

72
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,636
That's not
the whole plan, is it?

73
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,388
Oh, please.

74
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,156
Klaus may be
a miserable excuse

75
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:15,541
for a sibling,
but there is none

76
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,227
more diabolical.

77
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:20,396
That's only
the plan "a," luv.

78
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:22,231
There's always
a plan "B."

79
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:25,049
And what's
plan "B"?

80
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:28,186
War.

81
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,159

82
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,526
♪ Well,
I'm a long way from home ♪

83
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:39,031
♪ With some pressure
all my own ♪

84
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,751
♪ Such a long way from home ♪

85
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:46,955
♪ But I'll be back soon

86
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,424
♪ Yeah

87
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,959
Damn, I do look good
in a suit.

88
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:53,762
Joshua Rosen, 18,

89
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:55,264
had recently arrived
in New Orleans as part of...

90
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,632
My guy and the docks
is gonna come forward

91
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,467
as an eyewitness,
say he saw those two

92
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,387
drunkenly fall
into the Mississippi.

93
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,554
They'll be dredging
for weeks.

94
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:04,056
No one will come
looking around here.

95
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,441
That's good,
considering one

96
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,192
is dead in a dumpster
behind the county morgue

97
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,361
and the other one
is a vampire now.

98
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,830
Anything else?
Ow!

99
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,701
Allow me, darling.

100
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:16,952
One thing.

101
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,570
I sent 4 nightwalkers
to look into

102
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,373
a werewolf sighting
in the quarter.

103
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,159
I haven't heard
from them since.

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,944
That makes 10 dead
nightwalkers

105
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,796
in the last week.

106
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,465
You think the werewolves
are back in town

107
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,166
trying to start
some trouble?

108
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:34,303
Look. I know you
and Klaus are friends,

109
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:36,338
but the fact is, since
the Originals showed up...

110
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,257
Oh, come now,
Thierry.

111
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,975
You're not still upset
about that little,

112
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,544
toxic werewolf bite
I gave you, are you?

113
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,263
I thought we
were at by

114
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,665
I see you've given him free rein
of your compound now, too.

115
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,999
Yes. Well, seeing
as my family and I

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,968
lived here, built
the place, in fact...

117
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,220
All right.
Come on.

118
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,554
You both
know the drill.

119
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,223
Thierry is my guy,
inner circle.

120
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:56,458
Klaus is my old-time
friend and sire.

121
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,394
He's also
a guest here.

122
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:03,449
Peace, all right?
All right?

123
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,016
What you need,
my brother?

124
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:07,136
I'm afraid my sister
Rebekah is insisting

125
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:09,688
I demand
Elijah's return.

126
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,539
She's quite worked up
about it.

127
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,308
I'll say.

128
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,961
We're not gonna have 3 Originals
walking around town, are we?

129
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,362
Half our guys think the sister
killed the nightwalkers.

130
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:21,199
Is that an accusation
against an original?

131
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,158
What did I say
about peace?

132
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:28,340
Come on.

133
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,675
Walk with me.

134
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:35,013
Your inner circle man
lacks a sense of humor.

135
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,548
He's a little
overprotective,

136
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,317
but loyal to a fault.

137
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,352
I saved his life
back in the forties,

138
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,653
found him dying
of a war wound

139
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,105
outside a VA hospital.

140
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,357
He'd kill for me
and die for me.

141
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,109
Plus, that boy
can play the trumpet

142
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,944
like you
would not believe.

143
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,529
Maybe I'll see if he
can play a little

144
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,030
tonight at the party.

145
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,949
You're coming,
right?

146
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,118
How can I miss my chance
to meet the city councilman

147
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,737
as he accepts your gigantic
charitable donation?

148
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,956
Oh, he's a schmuck,
but he lets us

149
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,341
do our thing
in exchange

150
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,376
for certain
community services,

151
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:07,579
like keeping our fangs
out of the locals.

152
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,848
Listen. About
your brother,

153
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,583
I would love
to help you out,

154
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,018
but Thierry
is right.

155
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,353
My guys are on edge.

156
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,188
They see the original
family moving in,

157
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,057
vampires dying,
it makes them nervous.

158
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,692
If I hand Elijah
back now,

159
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,260
it might give
the wrong impression

160
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,062
about who's really
in charge here.

161
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,531
You know
what I mean?

162
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:30,152
You understand
I had to ask.

163
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:32,037
Hey, Klaus, for the love
of Mary Magdalene,

164
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,072
how long does it take
to ask a simple question?

165
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,407
Much longer
than you'd think,

166
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,994
considering the answer
was, as expected, no.

167
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:41,880
Marcel's man Thierry
is suspicious.

168
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,082
He thinks you killed
10 nightwalkers.

169
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,833
Well, that's a lie.
I only killed 8.

170
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,002
Should I make
Thierry the ninth?

171
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,587
Marcel
is playing friendly.

172
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,088
We can't kill
the favorite son,

173
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,423
or he'll catch
onto us.

174
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,559
So war it is, then.
Indeed.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,627
Do you know what to do
with the witch?

176
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,129
I believe I do.
Good.

177
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,731
You manage
Sophie Deveraux.

178
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:02,234
I'll take care
of the next step.

179
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,135
I ordered you to drain
him of blood.

180
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:07,940
What's taking so long?

181
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,159
Sorry. I'm not medieval
torture expert guy.

182
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,364
Ah...

183
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,748
What did he
do to you, anyway?

184
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,367
It's not about
what he did.

185
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,452
It's about what
he's going to do

186
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:22,320
when we're done here,
which is

187
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:26,041
whatever I want him to,
just like you.

188
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:30,761
For example, drive this
through his torso.

189
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,470
That is crazy.

190
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,506
I didn't want to do it,
but I did it, anyway.

191
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,458
It's called
mind compulsion.

192
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,227
Vampires can
compel humans.

193
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:46,628
Originals like
my siblings and I

194
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,146
can also compel
vampires,

195
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,948
and no one can
compel Originals.

196
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,451
You following? Good.

197
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,319
That is how a brand-new
nightwalker

198
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,187
such as yourself is here
doing my bidding

199
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,123
with no one
the wiser.

200
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,358
But I never had my guts
drained out of me.

201
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,412
Yes. That, young Joshua,
is because I got to you

202
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,863
before you had
even a drop

203
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,498
of herbal vervain
in your system.

204
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,867
You see, it prevents
compulsion.

205
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,585
Marcel has had his whole
crew taking it

206
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:13,138
since I returned
to town, and that is why

207
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,975
our friend here needs
to be bled dry of it

208
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:20,445
so I can compel him to
follow my every command,

209
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,648
and with my brother
currently in captivity

210
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,850
awaiting rescue,
we can't afford

211
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,852
to be gentle about it.

212
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:29,053
Come here. Yah!

213
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,991
Oh, so glad
you could make it.

214
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,526
Elijah only lies
daggered and rotting

215
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:35,861
whilst you
dillydally.

216
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:37,395
You're lucky
I came at all.

217
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,864
What do you want?

218
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,032
Hayley was attacked
last night by Marcel's crew

219
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,166
because somebody
told him there was

220
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,567
a werewolf
in the quarter.

221
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,786
She only made
one stop.

222
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:47,039
Whoever saw her here
ratted her out.

223
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,741
Watch and learn.

224
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:56,244
Hey, Soph.
Hey, Katie.

225
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,521
That's filled
with marigold,

226
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,556
great for attracting
the opposite sex,

227
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,191
would look
awesome on you.

228
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,977
I very seriously
doubt that.

229
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:11,530
Do you have any others,
one with, say...

230
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:15,600
I don't know...
Wolfsbane, perhaps?

231
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,869
Wolfsbane?
Why would you want that?

232
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,291
Please do not
play dumb with me.

233
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,776
Rebekah!

234
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,578
I just sold the werewolf
some herbs. That's all.

235
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,580
Are you lying to me,
Katie?

236
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,464
I suggest you answer
my question honestly.

237
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:34,052
Just answer the
question, Katie, please.

238
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,055
Yes. I told someone,
but you don't understand.

239
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,037
I... I love him.

240
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:50,298
Then tell me, who is this
vampire Romeo of yours?

241
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,969
Shall I count to 3?

242
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,642
Be quick about it.

243
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:59,611
I have an army to build,
and one compelled minion

244
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,747
does not an army make.

245
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:02,780
Well?

246
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,299
You were right
about the traitor.

247
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,784
Luckily, she's just a kid
and she doesn't know

248
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,285
anything about us
and what we're up to.

249
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,486
Do you want
to hear the part

250
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:09,621
that's gonna
please you the most?

251
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,256
Oh, do tell.

252
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,125
She's in love with someone
in Marcel's inner circle.

253
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,493
Guess who it is.

254
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:19,598
Right-hand-man type,
favors silly caps?

255
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,999
Two points for you.

256
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,635
Thierry is fraternizing
with the enemy.

257
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,304
Well, that means he
just unwittingly became

258
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:28,173
the key to
our entire plan.

259
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:29,640
I told you
you'd be pleased.

260
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:32,394
Oh, to be young and
in love in a city

261
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:35,781
where witches and
vampires are at war.

262
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:39,984
How very tragic.

263
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,447
Are you out
of your mind?

264
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,666
No way.
It's very simple.

265
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,619
We need you to perform
a teeny, tiny locator spell

266
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,903
to help us
find our brother.

267
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,839
Witches who practice
magic in this town

268
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,123
get caught, and
they get killed.

269
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,378
Yes. About that,
it seems you left out

270
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,548
a crucial detail
when we made our deal...

271
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:12,385
Marcel's secret weapon,
the way he knows

272
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,303
when a witch
is using magic.

273
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:18,274
Girl about yay high,
cute as a button, anger issues.

274
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:21,526
Davina?

275
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,863
Where have you
seen her?

276
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,214
I don't know.

277
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,899
The little brat
erased my memory

278
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,069
right after she threw me out
a window with her bloody mind.

279
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,938
Let me cut
to the chase.

280
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,856
Davina has Elijah.

281
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:37,743
You witches, I assume, want
to get Davina away from Marcel.

282
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,395
We don't know
where she is.

283
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:41,998
Ergo, we need magic.

284
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,833
Davina
would sense it.

285
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,668
Unless, of course,
another witch...

286
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:48,421
Say, a traitor
to the cause,

287
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:51,173
Katie, for example...
Was to perform

288
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:54,010
much more powerful magic
at the same time.

289
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,678
That would create
a smokescreen

290
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,963
concealing your very small
spell from Davina.

291
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,302
Katie doesn't
deserve to die.

292
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,737
Sophie Deveraux...

293
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:11,360
You're in no position
to be so principled.

294
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:14,780
You can't win a war without
a few strategic losses,

295
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,617
no matter how regrettable
they may be.

296
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:19,318
How many times
have the vampires

297
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,421
been one step ahead,
known something they shouldn't,

298
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,126
your sister executed
in the public square

299
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:30,713
for practicing magic
who knew she'd be caught?

300
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:34,216
Did she even
attempt to flee?

301
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:37,053
She was caught hiding
in a cargo hold

302
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,671
of a freighter
before it set sail

303
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,856
down the Mississippi.

304
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,776
And who, pray tell,

305
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,345
in Marcel's valued
inner circle

306
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:50,015
manages his business
at the docks?

307
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:53,018
Katie's boyfriend
Thierry.

308
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,862
You're right.
He's good.

309
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:06,499
Right? Music man
I call him.

310
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,168
Ladies love him,
but he's spoken for.

311
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,004
He knocks around with
this pretty, little witch,

312
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:16,542
says he loves her,
but I don't know.

313
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:18,594
Yo brightest soldier
is fraternizing

314
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:22,315
with your enemy,
and you don't care.

315
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,551
Well, of course I care,
but Thierry is a grown man.

316
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:27,320
He makes
his own choices,

317
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,155
and I get
some good intel.

318
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,489
Besides, he's not
gonna do anything

319
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,224
to jeopardize what
we're doing here.

320
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,526
I mean, check this out,

321
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:37,229
a vampire hosting
a ritzy charity event.

322
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,499
We have a community here.
No one is gonna mess that up.

323
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,288
Still...

324
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:49,542
You don't want the
witches to get too bold,

325
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,794
given that a witch's tip
about a werewolf in town

326
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:55,013
led to the disappearance
of your nightwalkers.

327
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,465
I'm sure you've
considered

328
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:58,916
the possibility that it
could've been a trap.

329
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,925
Maybe I'll send
a little message.

330
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,728
Thierry...

331
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,062
Take a team
of nightwalkers

332
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,147
to the cauldron
tonight,

333
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:12,531
do a little
rousting...

334
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:16,601
Oh, and, Thierry,
make it nasty.

335
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,274
And so with that,
I moved back here

336
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,327
to be closer to my brothers
because... let's face it...

337
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,446
Family is important,
right, Camille?

338
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,448
Cami. I have to change
this name tag.

339
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:31,449
Drunk guys keep hitting
on me in French.

340
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,085
You sure you haven't
been in here before?

341
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,770
Your face looks
so familiar.

342
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,422
Oh!

343
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:38,791
You must have seen me
out and about.

344
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,427
Aren't you dating
Marcel Gerard?

345
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:44,296
He's a pal of mine...
Sort of.

346
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,649
I heard he had a crush
on the blond bartender

347
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,734
at Rousseau's.

348
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:51,237
I would hardly
call it dating.

349
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,773
He's wooing me...
Sort of.

350
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,140
I don't know.

351
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,259
He's very charming,
which probably means

352
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,695
I should run
for the hills.

353
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,414
I'm kind of in an
on-again/off-again thing

354
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:02,698
myself at the moment.

355
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,282
Those are the worst,
aren't they,

356
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:05,418
the ones
you can't shake,

357
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,419
even though
you know better,

358
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,337
and you always
know better?

359
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,155
I like you, Cami.

360
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,291
Most girls have
the unfortunate tendency

361
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,493
of being whiny,
little twits.

362
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:16,629
Thanks... I think.

363
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,300
Hey, I'm supposed to go
to this posh charity thing

364
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,936
thrown by this
philanthropist tonight.

365
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,472
He's a bit of a Gatsby,
throws a mean party.

366
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,840
Any interest?

367
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,284
Little sister.

368
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,236
Well, brother, I believe
I've made certain

369
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:42,520
Marcel will be properly
distracted tonight.

370
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:43,956
Dare I ask?

371
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,358
Let's just say his attention
will not be on us.

372
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,410
I did my bit. What are you
doing to ensure

373
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:49,662
Elijah's
safe return?

374
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:52,081
Currently, I'm
preparing insurance

375
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,866
against
the tender-hearted.

376
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,000
Meaning?

377
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,002
We need proper
motivation for Katie

378
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,656
to cast a powerful
spell tonight.

379
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:03,976
I'm creating
that motivation.

380
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:07,512
Marcel has ordered
a rousting of the witches.

381
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,370
No!

382
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,388
I, in turn, have
arranged for things

383
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,190
to go tragically wrong.

384
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:20,826
You understand
what you're to do?

385
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,161
Good.

386
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,579
Aah!

387
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,405
Hey.

388
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,343
Mm.

389
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,244
What's happening
out there?

390
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,913
Oh, it's Klaus.

391
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,414
He's convinced Marcel
that the witches

392
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,383
are planning to make
a move against him.

393
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:47,386
Marcel wants us
to send a message,

394
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:49,522
and if he thought
I was playing favorites

395
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:52,224
just because I'm in
love with a witch...

396
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,259
Say that again.

397
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,429
I love you, Katie,

398
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,266
and all this is gonna
be ok, promise.

399
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,651
Marcel may not
be concerned

400
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,403
with Thierry's
romantic entanglements...

401
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,624
I already got
that one.

402
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,047
But there are other crimes
which he'll be

403
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:17,449
less inclined
to so easily forgive...

404
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,386
Aah!
Thierry! Aah!

405
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,620
Leave her alone.
Get off.

406
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,300
Killing a vampire,
for example.

407
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,322
That would be
unforgivable.

408
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,197
If Katie hopes to save
her one true love

409
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,033
from Marcel's punishment,
well, a rescue mission

410
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:54,336
like that will require
something positively magical,

411
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,790
but then...

412
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:02,326
What's worth dying for
if not love?

413

You look precious.

This party
is ridiculous,

425
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,630
but I think I could get
to enjoy this place.

426

Scotch, please.

inviting her here?

437

I think
she's darling.

00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:14,514
I can tell you fancy
her pure heart.

439
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,434
Perhaps I'll
feed it to you.

440
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:20,719
Hmm, jealousy looks
good on you, Bekah.

441
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:26,492
The guy of hers Rebekah
was talking about...

442
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:30,997
I'm sensing
that would be Marcel.

443
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,916
I wouldn't
worry about it.

444
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,734
Ancient history.

sister is a bit of a bitch.

Ha ha!

447
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,340
It's as though she
invented the term.

448
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,345
Listen.

449
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,082
Pardon me
for a moment.

450

Cami.

451
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,424
Hey, killer party.

452
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,310
Oh, it's more
of a work thing.

453
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,528
I would've
invited you...

454
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,029
Oh, no. We've been
on one date.

455
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,398
No explanation
necessary.

456
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,285
You do your thing.
I'll entertain myself.

457
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,487

00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,572
looking
the way you do?

459
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,741
Hell with that.

460
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,313
You're not
supposed to be out here.

461
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:55,198
Who are you?

462
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,449
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

463
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,751
I'm Sabine. We met.

464
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,586
I'm one of
Sophie's friends.

465
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,755
You're one
of the witches.

466
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,173
Sophie just
asked me to come

467
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:06,426
keep you company
while everyone is out.

468
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:10,597
You know,
it's drawn to you.

469
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:11,932
The child
you're carrying

470
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:14,050
is part vampire,
part werewolf.

471
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:16,002
You and Klaus made
something special.

472
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,306
You sound like Elijah.

473
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:24,060
He thinks this baby
is gonna make us

474
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:28,211
one big, happy family,
but now he's gone,

475
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:32,541
and I don't even know what...

476
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:36,122
It is.

477
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,357
You know,
I can do something

478

about that
if you want,

479
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,527

it's a boy or girl.

00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,662
I thought you couldn't do
witchy stuff around here.

00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:56,162
He broke Marcel's
biggest rule.

532
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,465
You'll never
see him again...

533
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:05,004
Unless we
do something.

534
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,940
"We"?

535
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:09,342
I want to save
our people.

536
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:12,445
You want to save
Thierry?

537
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,181
There's only one way
we can do both.

538
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,794
You ready?

539
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,808
Marcel. Something
is coming.

540
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,279
Magic.

541
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,198
I want to hear
your side of it.

542
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,333
Hey, Marcel,
come on.

543
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,284
Your version. Go.

544
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:34,620
We were tossing
the cauldron.

545
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:36,238
This guy,
some nightwalker,

546
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,708
he attacked Katie
for no reason.

547
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,209
His name was Max.
I turned him.

548
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,628
As far as reasons go,
he doesn't need one.

549
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,381
She was a witch.
He was a vampire.

550
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:49,083
Now he's dead.

551
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:54,056
I didn't mean
for it to happen.

552
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:56,892
You broke my most
important rule.

553
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:59,094
Damn it, T.

554
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:02,031
How long we been
friends, 70 years?

555
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:03,432
Yeah.

556
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,217
I turned you into something
that would never die.

557
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:07,737
I gave you a gift.

558
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,457
And I have been loyal
to you all this time,

559
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,876
and I still am.

560
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:17,446
I'm still
your friend, Marcel.

561
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:20,382
I swear,
that hasn't changed.

562
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:33,796
You were right, luv.

563
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:36,731
He's got a temper,
doesn't he?

564
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:44,322
I guess this is the moment
I remember I know better.

565
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:09,798
We found this
at his girl's place.

566
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,890
Still my friend, huh?

567
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,842
That's funny because
it looks to me

568
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,811
like that little witch of yours
got her hands on a spell

569
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:22,978
that I keep locked away.

570
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:24,363
Marcel, I have
never seen that.

571
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:25,514
Shut up.

572
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:26,615
I see on your hand,
you still have

573
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:27,900
the daylight ring
I gave you.

574
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:29,735
So what would you need
with the recipe

575
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:31,520
for making new ones
unless maybe you and Katie

576
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:33,856
were gonna go off and start
a little kingdom of your own?

577
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:34,957
Marcel, no.

578
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,659
Here's a lesson
in friendship.

579
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,961
Friends don't lie to me,
they don't break my rules,

580
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:42,213
and they do not steal
what is mine.

581
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:56,011
Ohh...

582
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,313
For the crime of murdering
one of his own,

583
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:00,149
I sentence
Thierry Vanchure

584
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,333
to 100 years
in the garden.

585
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:09,157
And it begins.

586
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:25,958
You're doing
the right thing.

587
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:29,512
It's the only way
to find Elijah.

588
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:32,597
I'm doing
what I have to do.

589
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,581
Katie, no!

590
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,917
Like clockwork.

591
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:09,417
Oh!

592
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:14,923
Aah!

593
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,323
Hurry.

594
00:30:34,995 --> 00:30:36,160
No!

595
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:49,625
You're here
to save your man.

596
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:52,928
Well, come on,
little girl.

597
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:54,663
Raagh!

598
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,599
Aah!

599
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,183
Die, you son
of a bitch.

600
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:00,468
No! Katie!

601
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:11,012
Something is wrong.
Katie's magic stopped.

602
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:13,682
I can keep going.

603
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,150
You can't.
She'll sense it.

604
00:31:15,151 --> 00:31:17,953
No. I can find Davina.
I just need another moment.

605
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:19,672
You may be willing
to die to get

606
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:21,189
your witch back,
but Hayley and the baby

607
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,791
will die with you.

608
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:23,993
Elijah will never
forgive us,

609
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,861
and rescuing him
will be for nothing.

610
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:31,198
It's over.
We failed.

611
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,388
No. Katie. No, no, no, no.

612
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,375
No.

613
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,663
Just tell me this.

614
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:09,010
Was she worth it?

615
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,639
I loved her.

616
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,756
Uhhhngh!

617
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,946
Seal him up

618
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:25,777
and let him rot.

619
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:58,164
How much did Cami see?

620
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:01,367
She just saw
an argument, mate.

621
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:04,202
It's nothing
you can't fix.

622
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:10,010
You really like her,
don't you?

623
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:13,146
I like that she's not
a part of any of this.

624
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:15,632
Sometimes it's good
to see the world

625
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,996
the way the humans do.

626
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:26,109
I am sorry about
Thierry, you know?

627
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,663
I can tell he was
a good friend.

628
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:31,614
I made him
what he was.

629
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:33,515
Obviously, my trust
was misplaced.

630
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,805
Doesn't make it
easier.

631
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:45,845
You saved me tonight.
I guess I owe you one.

632
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:49,248
You asked for
your brother back.

633
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:51,780
Seems like
the least I can do.

634
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,279
Cami...
Don't even try it.

635
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,748
I get the bro code.

636
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:23,066
You're here to
smooth things over

637
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,501
for your friend.

638
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:25,668
It's very nice
of you, but...

639
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:27,120
But you've been
hurt before,

640
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:29,488
and you aren't taking
any more chances.

641
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,591
Something like that.

642
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:34,444
The guy I saw
tonight,

643
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:38,181
not the guy
I thought he was,

644
00:34:38,182 --> 00:34:40,066
and if he can turn
on a dime like that...

645
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,803
Sounds like more than
just a broken heart.

646
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:47,389
Someone broke
your trust...

647
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:54,634
Camille, the brave
bartender.

648
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:06,479
I'm sorry...

649
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:11,530
But I need you to give
Marcel another chance.

650
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:17,603
Wow. I totally
misread that.

651
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:20,039
No. You read it
quite well,

652
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,625
but we all have
our roles to play.

653
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:28,898
You went to Marcel's.
You danced.

654
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:31,834
You feel badly hat he
had a row with his friend,

655
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:34,287
but otherwise,
all you remember

656
00:35:34,288 --> 00:35:37,539
is that it was perfect.

657
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:52,522
Well, tonight
was an epic failure.

658
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:54,640
On the contrary,
sister.

659
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:57,143
Tonight was
a masterpiece.

660
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:58,578
Are you mad?

661
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:00,479
Katie died before Sophie
could complete the spell.

662
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,649
Oh, I'm well aware.
I killed Katie.

663
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,752
You what?

664
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,454
There's no way our
little suicide witch

665
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:09,906
wasn't gonna
try and take out

666
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:11,757
Marcel with her.

667
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:14,761
I saved his life,
and in doing so,

668
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:19,515
I now have him exactly
where I want him.

669
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:22,051
Sophie trusted you.

670
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:25,171
I trusted you against
all my better instincts.

671
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:29,342
Wake up, Rebekah.

672
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:30,810
The witches
are on no one's side

673
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,111
but their own.

674
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,981
This girl Davina,
that's all they want,

675
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,232
and when they have her,
what do you think

676
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:38,985
happens then,
a truce?

677
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:40,069
Of course not.

678
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,955
They will use
Davina's power

679
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,456
against all of us.

680
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:45,992
Even if you're right,
the plan was to find Elijah,

681
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:48,161
and you failed us.

682
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:51,447
You always did
lack faith.

683
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,334
By protecting Marcel,
I've cemented his trust,

684
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:56,336
so much so
that he's agreed

685
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:59,005
to return Elijah to us,

686
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:00,590
and when the time
is right,

687
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:02,759
when he has told me
everything

688
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,778
I need to know
about Davina,

689
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:08,713
I will have her
for myself.

690
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,101
I have all the faith
in the world

691
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:14,687
that you'll get
what you want, Nik.

692
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:16,806
You always do,

693
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,224
no matter what it costs
the rest of us.

694
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:25,230
You disgust me.

695
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,934
Are you ok?
I was so worried.

696
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,102
Thank you.

697
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,470
Whatever you did,
I felt it.

698
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,888
You helped me.

699
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:55,640
It was the old ones,
wasn't it?

700
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,309
Actually, Klaus is the one
that saved me tonight.

701
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,944
I'm gonna
make things right,

702
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,779
starting off by giving
him his brother back.

703
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,816
No.
What?

704
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,736
Davina...
No.

705
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:11,955
You said the old ones
were dangerous.

706
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:16,826
I won't give him back
until I know how to kill them.

707
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,683
I thought you might
like to know,

708
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,883
Elijah is
returning to us.

709
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,556
Congratulations.

710
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:49,576
I guess being diabolical
has its perks.

711
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,000
You hardly know him,
and yet you miss him.

712
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:02,072
What is it about my brother
that always inspires

713
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,175
such instant admiration?

714
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,079
He was kind to me.

715
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,883
There are
moments when I doubt

716
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,803
if my family
is capable of redemption...

717
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:20,874
Hey, I learned
something today.

718
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,178
I think it's a girl.

719
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,372
Elijah, voice-over
yet each time that I am tempted

720
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:39,577
to surrender, I see it,
the glimmer of goodness

721
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:42,579
that allows me to believe.

722
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,296
You're following me.

723
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:14,110
Maybe you're
just in my way.

724
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,796
I told you
no good would come

725
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,515
from this unholy alliance
of yours.

726
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,087
At least
I'm doing something.

727
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:41,938
What about you?

728
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,446
Sabine, tell them
what you saw.

729
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,118
It's the girl,
the wolf.

730
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,491
I think it's a girl.

731
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,526
No. Wait.

732
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,328
Wait what?

733
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,497
Please tell me I'm not
having a mini Klaus.

734
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,456
Hoc est infantima malom.

735
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:18,375
Nos omnia perdetu el eam.

736
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:21,694
Hoc est infantima malom.

737
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:25,215
Nos omnia perdetu el eam.

738
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:03,515
