30
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,260
麥克斯  我知道新時間表該怎么排了
Okay, Max, I figured out our new schedule.

31
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,720
我也才知道我們用的便宜牙膏
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste

32
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,930
其實是放尿布疹軟膏
we've been using is really diaper cream.

33
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,760
但好歹我牙齦上的尿布疹都消了
On the plus side, that rash cleared up on my gums.

34
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,330
晚上6點到清晨2點在餐廳上班
We'll do our diner shift from 6:00 till 2:00,

35
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,890
清晨2點到清晨4點賣小蛋糕
then sell cupcakes here from 2:00 to 4:00,

36
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,960
早上7點到11點做小蛋糕
make the cupcakes in the morning from 7:00 to 11:00,

37
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,640
然后中午12點到下午4點去學校
And then pastry school from 12:00 to 4:00.

38
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,220
-有忘了什么嗎  -拉屎跟睡覺時間
- Forget anything? - Just poopin' and sleepin'.

39
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,820
現在我得去重安排時間表了
Now, I have to go rewrite the schedule.

40
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,950
來吧  麥克斯  明天是你的超超大日子
Let's go, Max, you have a huge, huge day tomorrow.

41
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,670
第一天上烘焙學校
First day of pastry school.

42
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,140
別說"超超大"了
Stop saying it's huge.

43
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,490
每次以為要看到"超大東西"時
Whenever I think something's gonna be huge,

44
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,010
最后都只看到"大巨蛋"
It just turns out to be all balls.

45
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,240
我花錢干洗了我的襯衫
I splurged and had my blouse cleaned.

46
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,820
這干洗袋讓我想起了當有錢人的時光
Dry cleaning bags remind me of when I had money.

47
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,610
那袋子只讓我回想起
Really? They remind me of

48
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,750
我媽曾想把我悶死
when my mother tried to suffocate me.

49
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,160
據說而已啦  走吧
Allegedly. Let's go.

50
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,290
等等  麥克斯  你還不能走
Wait, wait. Max, you can't go yet.

51
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,320
我需要你留下來幫忙一件事
I need you to stay and help with something.

52
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,850
阿憨  我都教過你了  
Han, I told you-- it's bend and wipe,

53
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,940
彎下身擦屁股  褲子拉上穿穿好
then up come your big boy pants.

54
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
阿憨說得對  你不能走
Yeah, Han's right. You can't go.

55
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,700
再待一會吧
Stay here a few more minutes.

56
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,600
為啥
Why?

57
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,700
我們要開麥克斯的批斗大會嗎
Are we having an intervention for Max?

58
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,570
大家安安
Hey, everybody.

59
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,200
我還沒錯過"歡慶麥克斯
Oh, I hope I'm not late for Max's

60
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,870
首日上學驚喜派對"吧
first day of school surprise party.

61
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,370
蘇菲  我們都還沒給她驚喜呢
Sophie, we hadn't surprised her yet.

62
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,880
她站在這都聽見啦
Oh, but she's right there.

63
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,120
驚喜都被你劇透光了  阿憨
You just blew it, Han.

64
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,500
有驚喜派對呢
Aw, a surprise party.

65
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,020
-是不是很溫馨啊  麥克斯  -我才不信咧
- Isn't this sweet, Max? - I don't trust it.

66
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,550
上次奧列格給過我"驚喜"
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,

67
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,080
他把雞雞塞在熱狗面包中間了
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

68
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
一盒肉香滿溢披薩
One meat lover's pizza.

69
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,190
一位肉欲滿溢愛人
And one meat lover.

70
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,900
麥克斯  快來  "趁熱享用"哦
Max, come on. Get it while it's hot.

71
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,710
你去打開那盒子
You're opening that box.

72
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,660
誰有十塊錢
Hm, who's got a ten

73
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,660
給這個可愛的送披薩男小費啊
to tip the cute pizza delivery guy?

74
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,170
蘇菲  他是路易斯  白班服務生
Sophie, this is Luis, the day waiter.

75
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,750
你就是蘇菲啊
Oh, you're Sophie,

76
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,900
奧列格的前任
Oleg's ex.

77
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,330
姐妹  我對你了如指掌
Sister, I know all about you.

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,770

Oh, do you?

79
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,230
你真的對我從里到外都了解嗎
Do you know all about me?

80
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,040
我是他的好朋友
I'm his good friend.

81
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,930
你的口音有點重  我聽不太清楚
You know, I'm having trouble hearing your accent.

82
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,140
是"好朋友"還是"女"朋友啊
Did you say "good friend" or "girlfriend?"

83
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,280
拜托  我倒想呢
Please, mami. I wish.

84
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,360
我喜歡這娛樂節目啊

麥克斯  我們都以你為傲

明天是你后半生的第一天

Aw, crap. I gotta do this again?

90
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,270
行  但是這次
All right, but this time,

91
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,550
我不要再看勵志電影了
I'm not seeing Trouble With the Curve.

92
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,910
你即將要干一番大事業
You are about to do something very big.

93
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,150
對啊  向前邁大步
Yes, she is. Such a big step.

94

我們一起邁進一大步
Big step for both of us,

95
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,080
因為我也得用我的商業頭腦
'cause I'll be using my business acumen

96
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,140
在辦公室里工作來幫她賺學費
working in the office to help pay the tuition.

97
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,310
別吵  我是在說麥克斯呢
Shh. I'm talking about Max.

98
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,360
我們大家都湊錢給你買禮物
So we all chipped in to get you something

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,300
慶祝你首日上學

- It's my first day too. - Caroline, please,

101
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,510
你害我聽不到阿憨說麥克斯什么了
I can't hear Han talking about Max, okay?

102
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,020
給  小寶貝
Here you go, darling,

103
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,640
上學的書包
A book bag for school.

104
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,390
所以給我的驚喜派對是在這之后嗎
So what, then? Is my surprise party after this one?

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,370
這是怎么一回事
What is happening?

106
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,140
有人笑容滿面地對我好
People doing nice things for me and smiling?

107
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,660
是不是又要換寄養家庭了
Am I transferring foster homes again?

108
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,810
里面還有別的東西哦
And there's more stuff inside.

109
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,670
你又把驚喜先劇透出來了
That was supposed to be a surprise too.

110
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,050
驚喜吧
Oh. Surprise!

111
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,430
麥克斯  打開  看看里面東西
Max, open it. Look inside.

112
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,800
對啊  麥克斯  看看里面有啥
Yeah, Max, see what's inside for your big day.

113
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,660
麥克斯的大日子  也是我的大日子哦
Big day for Max. Big day for me as well.

114
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,100
一張交通卡  不是吧
A metrocard? No way.

115
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,380
我送的  無限乘坐哦
From me. Unlimited rides.

116
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,410
無限"騎"[乘坐]嗎
Oh. Unlimited rides?

117
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,720
你屁股上的騷貨紋身是這個嗎
Is that what your tramp stamp says?

118
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,370
本來要跟你吵的  但你這吐槽實在是妙
I was gonna get mad, but that was a damn good one.

119
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,000
這又是啥  阿憨的房子嗎
What's this? Han's house?

120
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,700
你簡單說句"謝謝"就夠了
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
謝謝你送我你的房子  阿憨
Thank you for your house, Han.

122
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,480
鉛筆盒  我好喜歡啊
It's a pencil case, and I love it.

123
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,070
我剛才還干坐在這  想著你們會不會
And I was sitting here, thinking how you were

124
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,690
忘了明天也是我的大日子呢
all ignoring my part of the big day.

125
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,630
然后你們就送了我這個
And then, you give me this pencil case

126
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,650
帶去上班用的鉛筆盒  証明我想錯了
to use in the office and prove me wrong.

127
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,280
那是送麥克斯的
That's for Max.

128
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,230
你們他媽腦子是哪有問題啊
What the hell is wrong with you people?

129
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,140
麥克斯都不需要用鉛筆
Max doesn't even need pencils.

130
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,020
她會在烘焙東西
She'll be baking.

131
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,930
她是會暈乎乎[烘焙]才對
Well, she'll be baked.

132
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,280
打開看看
Take a look.

這一盒夠我抽到今天休息時間了
These should last me till recess.

136
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,850
等等  蘇菲要送的繡名廚師制服呢
Wait, where's the Chef's coat Sophie had monogrammed?

137
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,170
阿憨  這是我要送的驚喜呢
Han, that was supposed to be a surprise.

138
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,340
我故意的  報應來了吧
Oh, I know. Karma's a bitch.

139
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,260
好吧
Oh, well.

140
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,810
給
Look.

141
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,800
上面有我名字呢
My name's on this.

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,650
唯一上面有過我名字的東西
the only thing my name's ever been on before

143
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,700
是驗毒尿檢杯

144
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,860
謝謝你們大家
Thank you, everyone.

145
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,940
所以那書包里沒一樣東西是給我的嗎
So there is nothing in that bag for me?

146
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,670
毛都沒有嗎
Nothing?

147
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,150
現在如果送我奧列格的雞雞熱狗  我都愿意收下
I'd even take Oleg's penis in a hot dog bun right now.

148
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,300
馬上給你做
I'll be right back.

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,740
我愛死地鐵了
I love the subway.

155
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,980
發泄怒氣的完美地點
It's the perfect place to get out aggression.

156
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,960
我剛才錘了一拳別人的肚子
I just punched someone in the kidney.

157
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,590
正是在下
It was me.

158
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,070
我知道
I know.

159
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,350
好臭的屁味
Oh, oh, bad smell,

160
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,020
是誰吃了中東蔬菜球啊
Like someone hooked up with a falafel.

161
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,100
-正是在下  -我知道
-It was me. - I know.

162
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,550
-克制點  -抱歉
- Max. - Sorry.

163
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,920
地鐵里  飛機上  舞池中  我任屁自放
Subways, planes, and mosh pits, I let it ride.

164
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,390
我愛死這件上衣干洗后清新的味道了
I love the smell of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

165
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,820
我好興奮我能擺脫那服務生制服
I am so excited to be out of that waitress uniform,

166
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,600
重新穿上我的時尚工裝
and back in my chic business clothes,

167
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,550
然后走進我的辦公室
and, you know, going to my office,

168
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,790
在那里運用著我的沃頓才華
where I'll probably save the day

169
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,850
拯救辦公室於水火之中
using some of my Wharton magic.

170
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,390
我更喜歡你內心希望全滅的樣子
You know, I think I like you better without hope.

171
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,670
麥克斯  你知道這學校學費很貴吧
Max, you know this school is expensive, right?

172
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,260
你會抱著積極心態去上課吧
You're going in with a good attitude, right?

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,740
不是啊  不然厄爾的"鉛筆盒"是干啥用的
No, that's what Earl's pencils are for.

174
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,330
別擔心啦  我會盡力
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

175
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,020
你看  這次我有個書包呢
I mean, look, I have a book bag.

176
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,770
以前我去上學  我媽唯一給我帶的東西
The only thing my mother ever sent me to school with

177
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,260
就是張寫了"幫忙檢查虱子"的字條
was a note that said "Check me for lice."

178
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,130
大家送你書包真是太貼心了
It was so sweet of everyone to give you that,

179
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,350
雖然這害我一整晚睡不著
even though I didn't sleep all night about it.

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,730
而且看起來不便宜呢
And it looks kind of expensive.

181
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,160
看看是什么牌子的
Check for a designer label.

182
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,700
何必呢  心意最重要嘛
Why? It's the thought that counts.

183
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,400
胡說八道
Since when?

184
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,010
讓我看看
Let me see it.

185
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,200
第二大道站
Second avenue station.

186
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,880
這里是第二大道站
This is second avenue.

187
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,750
慘了  麥克斯
No, no, no, Max!

188
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,470
他搶到了書包  很好  麥克斯
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

189
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,840
千萬別放手
Don't let go.

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,200
萬一車子發動了
What if the train starts to leave

191
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
然后我手斷了咋辦
and my arms pop off?

192
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,070
我還怎么去上烘焙學校啊
How will I go to pastry school?

193
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,630
我就得跟那些殘疾用嘴來
I'll be one of those people decorating cookies

194
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,290
裝飾餅干的人一樣了
with a bag in their mouth.

195
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,730
你是個魔鬼
You are the devil.

196
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,910
魔鬼
The devil.

197
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,480
你就是個渣渣
You have nothing.

198
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,560
拉  麥克斯  快拉  從魔鬼手上拉走
Pull, Max, pull! Pull it from the devil!

199
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,720
拉不走啊  這魔鬼有健身
Can't. The devil works out.

200
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,150
我的書包
My bag.

201
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,780
我的襯衫
My blouse.

202
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,860
我的大麻
My weed.

203
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,440
這下好了  都開始上課了
Oh, great, look. Class has started.

204
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,510
我的新生活已經搞砸了
My new life already blows.

205
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,940
帥氣大廚在里面呢
Oh, look. There's Chef gorgeous.

206
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,560
我不想讓他看到我這么狼狽
I don't want him to see me like this.

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,730
我去洗手間看看
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see

208
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,640
能不能用冷水把這臟污弄掉
if cold water can get out any of the stain.

209
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,820
-快進去上課  -可是我的廚師服跟書包沒了
- Go, Max. - But I don't have my chef coat or book bag.

210
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,450
我知道它們只在我生命中存在過几小時
I know I only had them for a couple of hours,

211
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,390
但那是我最美好的時光
but it was the best part of me.

212
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,510
你能行的
You'll do great.

213
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,190
先幫我個忙  檢查我有沒有虱子
First, do me a favor. Check me for lice.

214
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,160
這門課是設計來向你們介紹
This course is designed to introduce you

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,210
一些技朮與技巧
to the skills and techniques required

216
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,890
來制作如發面面包
in the production of yeast bread,

217
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,040
酥皮面團  奶黃餅  泡芙
short pastry doughs, custards, pate a choux,

218
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,190
以及蛋糕糊等等
and cake batters.

219
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,040
麥克斯大廚  你遲到了
Chef Max, you are late.

220
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,930
你確定課不是10點17分開始嗎
Wait, are sure class doesn't start at 10:17?

221
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,260
對不起  我在地鐵上被混蛋給搶劫了
Sorry, I got robbed on the subway by some jerk.

222
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,010
喂喂喂  干嘛指鼻子罵我
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here.

223
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,010
我沒錢走投無路 
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna

224
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,570
又不想跳脫衣舞賺學費  所以...
strip my way through pastry school.

225
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,980
可以靠脫衣舞賺學費嗎
That's an option?

226
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,940
好了  廚師們  專心點
All right, Chefs. Let's focus.

227
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,650
他剛是說他想"搞我們"[專心]嗎
Did he say he wants to "foke us"?

228
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,910
{\an8}越洗越糟了

229
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,500
早安啊  碧碧
Morning, Bebe.

230
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,240
天啊  你這是怎么了
Hi. Oh, my God. What happened to you?

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,700
我先提醒你  我的醫生說
And I should tell you my doctor says

232
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,530
我接下來一個月內都不應該聽到壞消息
I'm not allowed to hear bad news for another month.

233
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,770
抱歉我這么狼狽來上班
I apologize for my appearance.

234
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,230
但我們在地鐵上被搶了
We got robbed on the subway,

235
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,950
然后被拿著熱咖啡的人弄了一身
and then someone hit me with hot coffee.

236
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,750
然后我去用了冷水想洗掉咖啡漬
Then, I went to wash cold water on the stain

237
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,140
結果沒洗掉  還弄得像要參加
and somehow wound up entering myself

238
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,080
性感"濕身"選美賽了
in a wet t-shirt contest.

239
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,780
負面能量太多我扛不住
Um, that's a lot of energy for me,

240
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,980
先讓我坐在位子上休息
So I'm just gonna need to sit here

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,240
然后平靜一會吧
for a second and be quiet.

242
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,760
我知道我現在該讓你平靜  我也支持
I know we're being quiet, which I'm all about,

243
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
好可愛的小狗啊
but cute dogs.

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,070
謝謝  這是可卡犬
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.

245
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,970
我拯救了他們
I rescue them.

246
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,020
大家都想著去拯救灰狗  斗牛犬啊
You know, people rescue greyhounds and pit bulls,

247
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,290
但都沒人想到可卡也需要拯救
but everyone ignores the cocker spaniel.

248
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,380
都覺得可卡犬惡心  要宰了他們
They're like, "Ew, eye goo. Shoot it."

249
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,500
我養了三只可卡[三根雞雞]
I have three cockers.

250
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,940
你有寵物嗎
Do you have any pets?

251
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,780
有匹馬  叫栗寶
I have a horse, Chestnut.

252
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,510
他是只純種馬
He's a thoroughbred.

253
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,150
我該從哪里開始幫忙呢
Well, what can I do first?

254
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,200
這是什么  為什么給了我果汁菜單
What's this? Why am I holding a juice menu?

255
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,990
每天我們都為所有學生與員工
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice

256
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,610
買新鮮的鮮榨果汁
for the students and the staff.

257
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,630
太享受了
What a treat.

258
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,920
新鮮果汁是純騙錢的
Fresh juice is such a scam

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,870
但是別人請的就不算
unless someone else is payin'.

260
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,650
我要一杯綠色三號
I'll take the greens number three.

261
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,000
好的  寫上單子
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list

262
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
然后去問別人要喝什么吧
when you get the other ones.

263
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,010
等等  所以是我得去買果汁嗎
Wait, I'm supposed to get the juice?

264
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,880
我就是壞消息集中地
Oh, boy, it's like I'm a bad news machine.

265
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,350
沒關系
Okay.

266
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,480
樂意效勞  沒意料到  但很樂意幫忙
Happy to do it. Surprised, but happy.

267
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,850
那我可以借一套那可愛的廚師服穿穿嗎
Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute Chef jackets.

268
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,800
尼可拉斯大廚規定了只有烘焙廚師能穿
Oh, Chef Nicholas only permits pastry Chefs to wear these.

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,610
但我不能第一天就這么狼狽的出場吧
But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.

270
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,010
當買果汁的人已經夠慘了吧
I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.

271
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,510
我有一些健身衣服可以給你穿
I have some workout clothes you can wear.

272
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,420
你放心  我一次都還沒穿過
Don't worry. I haven't worn them yet.

273
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,500
但總有一天會穿的
But I will someday.

274
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,780
你們好  大家好啊
Hi. Hi, everyone.

275
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,180
我是來問你們喝什么鮮果汁
I'm here to take the fresh juice orders

276
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,580
也順便說一聲  我本來上班穿的不是這個
and also to say this is not what I came to work in.

277
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,560
我穿的衣服可沒瞪著大眼的狗頭
What I came to work in had less eyes.

278
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,280
卡洛琳  歡迎你
Caroline, welcome.

279
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,750
-在辦公室干得怎么樣  -很好  
- How is it going in the office so far? - So great,

280
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,380
我今天真不是穿這個來上班
and so not what I came to work in.

281
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,500
通常我穿的都是香奈兒  而不是犬衣
I'm usually wearing Chanel, not le chien.

282
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
那是法語"狗"的意思
That's "dog" in French.

283
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,940
那也是英語"二"的意思
Oh, 'cause it's "dork" in English.

284
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,350
很高興見到你們倆
Well, it is lovely to see both of your faces.

285
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,250
同學  我們先從基本的開始
Class, we start with the basics.

286
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,370
不  不  后面的同學
No, no, no, you in the back--

287
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,030
喝果汁嗎  小姐  想從一個
Juice, miss? Care for a juice

288
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,060
高考成績1560分的人那點果汁嗎[舊制滿分1600]
from someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

289
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,380
你居然考超過500分
You can score more than 500?

290
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,510
你干嘛要穿這件衣服啊
Why the hell are you wearing that?

291
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,810
這讓你的胸部顯得更平更悲哀
I didn't think your chest could get any sadder.

292
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,240
這是碧碧的衣服
It's Bebe's.

293
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,120
麥克斯  我來這工作不是幫人點果汁的
Max, taking juice orders is not what I came here to do.

294
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,270
我懂你意思  我點一杯寶石紅
I hear you. I'll have the ruby red.

295
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,480
我總是保持花嘴干淨[龜頭]
I always keep the edge clean,

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,610
這樣當我擠[射]的時候
So when I'm squeezing it,

297
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,730
奶油[精液]就不會噴得哪兒都是了
It's not gonna have cream popping all over the place.

298
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,700
警世良言啊
Words to live by.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,950
可惜我恰恰相反
I have the opposite problem.

300
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,210
瞧  我的"奶油"噴涌而出
Yo, my cream's poppin' right now.

301
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,930
你這是干嘛
What are you doing?

302
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,930
你答應過我會認真上課的
You told me you were gonna take school seriously.

303
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,980
不能怪我  是那家伙帶壞我
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.

304
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,100
你看他
Look at him.

305
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,010
他長得就像芝麻街卡通里買毒品的人
He looks like someone who sells drugs on Sesame Street.

306
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,580
你敢玩出火就殺了你
You're gonna get in trouble,

307
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,980
我犧牲穿可卡犬衣服
and I am not wearing a cocker spaniel

308
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,770
可不是為了看你被踢出去
so you can get kicked out of class.

309
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,650
好  我知道了
Right. I hear you.

310
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,570
話說我的果汁呢
Now, where's my juice?

麥克斯大廚  快看我的獨家技能

超棒超惡心的聲音
Awesome gross sound bonus.

313
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,120
大廚  你要覺得這樣玩很有意思
Chef, if you find this so funny,

314
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,400
不如你出去跟"五指"姑娘玩吧
why don't you take a fiver?

315
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,390
反正你不就愛說這些嗎
Isn't this how your saying goes?

316
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,510
我沒愛說這些
I don't have a saying,

317
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,000
但如果我有  那應該是
but if I did, it'd be more like

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
"口交不算偷吃"
"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

319
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,870
如果有人覺得有東西很好笑
Anyone else who finds something hilarious

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,630
-麥克斯大廚  -不用了  一點都不好笑
- Chef Max? - Nope, nothing 'ilarious.

繼續上課吧
Teach on.

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,900
不許再開黃腔了
Enough with the dirty jokes.

324
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,640
我們來這的目的是成為優秀的面包師[自慰師]
We are all here to become master bakers.

325
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,110
我在掌握烘焙[自慰]這方面可是下了不少[硬]功夫

- Deke. - Did you say "Geek?"

329
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,960
大"鳥"迪克的迪克
Deke, as in "Big Deke."

330
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,220
我的更大
Mine's bigger.

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,770
我們應該成為搭檔
We should be lab partners.

332
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,620

好了  別玩了  別玩了
Okay, now stop, stop, stop.

我在努力當個好學生
I am trying to be a good student,

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,030
所以你離我遠點
so you just stay away from me.

339
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,810
你會帶壞我的
You are a bad influence.

340
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,450
我這番話肯定超順  因為小時候
And I know I nailed that speech 'cause kids at school

341
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,200
同學們總對我說這番話
used to say it to me all the time.

342
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,830
-到時間換衛生棉了嗎  -是的

345
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,430
那是用來放針的
Ah, keep my needles in this.

346
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,400
你居然還是個癮君子
You're a drug addict too?

347
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
天啊  想不跟你一起混真難
God. You are irresistible.

348
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,330
是用來打胰島素的  我是個糖尿病患

350
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,070
你的自毀傾向比我的強多了
Wow, you're even more self-destructive than me.

351
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,920
糖尿病  什么感覺啊
So diabetes, how is that?

352
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,690
很沒勁  我寧可得梅毒
Disappointing. I put in for syphilis.

別笑了  老娘要穿著這衣服

去兩個街區外扛27杯果汁

355
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,600
你干嘛讓狗頭女這樣跟你說話啊
Why'd you let the dog lady talk to you like that?

356
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,250
即使穿著那件傻逼衣服  她還是我的朋友
She's my friend, even in that shirt.

357
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,370
又花了我12塊錢
Well, there goes another $12.

358

我干洗這件襯衫的錢

360
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,780
健保  你是說我們從9毛9店
Health care? You mean that box of band-aids

361
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,940
買回來的那一盒子止血貼吧

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,960
我被果汁店員叫"倒霉狗"

"倒霉狗  你的果汁好了"

倒霉狗  上菜了

你去吧  我要坐在這休息一會
Can you? I'm kind of just sitting here a minute,

369
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,800
享受不被人使喚的美好時光
enjoying not being told what to do.

370
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,840
我在那間學校真是受夠了
I get enough of it at that school.

371
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,930
聽著
Look.

372
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,420
如果你要學人老媽使喚小孩  學像點
If you're gonna do the mother thing, do it right.

373
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,840
把你的手伸進油鍋  或更慘一點
Stick your hand in boiling oil or even more painful,

374
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,790
狂看精彩電視台的《日落沙哈》

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,950
現在就進廚房  我有話跟你說

出去  有人准備因為培訓的事而被訓
Leave, someone's about to get schooled about school.

378
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,720
貌似場面會變得丑陋不堪[淫穢下流]
This looks like it's going to get dirty and ugly.

379
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,990
我可以錄下來嗎
May I film it?

380
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,820
如果可以錄  我能放到網上賣嗎
And if so, may I then sell it on the internet?

381
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,350
聽著  你這么做不能只是為了我
Look. You can't just do this for me.

382
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,440
-說得對  那我們退學嗎  -當然不行
- You're right. So we're out? - No, we're not out,

383
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
你說過你會為我這么做的
you said you were gonna do this for me.

384
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,610
我知道  可你剛不是說
I know, but you just said

385
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,110
我不能為了你才這么做嗎
I can't just do it for you,

386
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,250
我覺得你說得對
And I agree.

387
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,490
-我的意思是  我騙誰啊  -我啊
- I mean, who was I kidding? - Me.

388
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,500
你騙我
You were kidding me.

389
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,450
我去那里上班是想施展我的商業才能
I went in there thinking I was gonna use my business skills,

390
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,480
而我曾經希望跟法國佬
and whatever hope I had of a flirtation

391
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,400
調情賣騷現在也沒戲了
with Frenchie McFrench went out the window

392
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,910
因為他看見我穿著那件T恤  上面寫著
when he saw me wearing that T-shirt that said,

393
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,950
"記得節育  勿忘閹割"
"Don't forget to spay and neuter me."

394
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,080
好吧  我退學  沒關系
Fine, I can quit. It's fine.

395
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,590
-真的嗎  -假的  當然有關系啦
- It is? Really? - No, it's not fine.

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,010
-我騙誰啊  -我啊  你騙我

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,880
能讓你保持興趣的東西
there to keep you interested,

399
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,750
因為你去烘焙學校不能只是為了我
because you can't go to pastry school just for me,

400
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,300
而我也不會為了你而退學
and I'm not gonna not go to pastry school for you.

401
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,120
好吧  你說得對  麥克斯

我當然會為你這么做
Of course I'll do it for you.

403
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,230
我只是今天過得很糟糕
I just had a bad day.

404
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,410
我們都是
I mean, we both did.

405
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,340
你丟了書包和大麻
You lost your man's briefcase and your drugs,

406
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,650
而我丟了自尊和可能有的小戀情
and I lost my dignity and a possible love interest.

407
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,010
驚喜吧
Surprise!

408
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,120
瞧  驚喜就應該是這樣
See, that's how it's supposed to go.

409
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,980
我們給你買了個新書包
We got you a new book bag.

410
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,190
一套新的大廚制服
Yeah, and a new Chef's jacket.

411
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,390
還有一把彈簧刀
And a switchblade.

412
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,230
對啊  因為我們不想再買第三套大廚服了
Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin' another Chef's jacket.

413
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,210
麥克斯  你知道這意味著什么嗎
Max, you know what this means?

414
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,970
我得到兩次驚喜禮物  而你毛都沒有嗎
That I got two surprises, and you got nothing?

415
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,140
不  在學校一切都會好的
No, that everything's gonna work out at that school.

416
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,410
我是說  眨眼之間
I mean, in the blink of an eye,

417
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,240
就像這樣  事情可以由壞變好
just like this, things can change from bad to good.

418
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,080
也不算完全變好
Well, not totally good.

419
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,860
我依舊毛都沒有
They still haven't gotten me anything.

420
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,500
卡洛琳  有你的禮物
Caroline, you didn't not get anything.

421
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,060
給  你專屬的鉛筆盒
Here, your very own pencil case.

422
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,380
但沒"鉛筆"  我的"鉛筆"供貨商被抓了
But no pencils. My pencil dealer got busted.

423
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,070
謝謝你們  我感動死了
Thank you, guys. I'm touched.

424
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,150
真是萬萬沒想到啊
I was not expecting it.

425
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,250
是嗎  你可是拿一哭二鬧三上吊來強迫我們
Really? 'cause you kinda bullied us all into it.

426
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,340
我的SAT成績語言成績是780分
So that's a 780 on verbal,

427
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,040
數學成績也是780分
and a 780 on math.

428
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,230
而且我拿的是金融學位
And with my degree in Finance,

429
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,150
在市里跑來跑去買果汁這種事
jackass-ing around the city getting juice

430
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,000
完全是在浪費我的天賦啊
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,520
我畢業典禮時的優秀學生代表說過
And as the valedictorian at my graduation said--

432
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,870
也就是我自己說過
and I'm stealin' from myself here,

433
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,050
"我看見了金融界的未來
"I've seen the future of Finance,

434
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,640
也就是我們"
and it's us."

435
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,080
所以你是想讓我去買果汁嗎
So you want me to get the juices?

436
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,730
就今天  拜托了
Just for today. Please?

437
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,820
法式蛋白乾是練習
Meringue cookies are a simple way

438
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,090

439
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,090
真是個有趣的技巧啊  大廚
Hm, interesting technique you got going there, Chef.

440
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,420
伙計  我們得拋棄彼此的無聊搭檔
Dude, we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners.

441
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,150
我被一位老奶奶拖累
I'm stuck over there with grandma.

442
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,230
不要  我不想換掉我旁邊的大胖子
No, I'm staying with the big guy next to me.

443
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,310
他才不會讓我惹麻煩
He's not gonna get me in trouble.

444
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,990
他從不說話  快走開
He never talks. Get outta here.

445
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,610
回到你的桌子上去  胖子阿伯特
Go back to your own table, Fat Albert.

446
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,650
{\an8}《胖子阿伯特》是美國70年代開始風行的熱門卡通劇集
主角是一名黑胖子

447
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,650
好吧
Okay.

448
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,490
我回去
I'm going back.

449
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,350
但你叫我胖子阿伯特  是因為我是黑人
And the Fat Albert thing was 'cause I'm black,

450
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,900
不是胖  對不對
Not fat, right?

451
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,690
因為我一年怎么也去兩三次健身房吧
'cause I go to the gym two, three times a year.

452
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,300
我聽到前面只有說話聲  沒有干活聲
I hear talking, but no baking up front.

453
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,580
不  不  你聽到的只有干活聲
No, no, no, you only hear baking.

454
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,210
這里在激烈地"干"呢
Just furiously master-baking up here.

455
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,840
蛋白乾要有漂亮的尖角
The meringue needs to have nice peaks.

456
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
你們要做出濕濕的尖尖角[乳頭]
You are looking to make moist, pointy peaks.

457
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,650
我最喜歡捏"它們"了
I like to pinch them.

458
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,080
主廚  咱倆私下說一句
Chef, seriously, man-to-man,

459
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,590
有個問題
we got a problem.

460
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,670
我覺得麥克斯不應該跟那個大胖子在一組
I don't think Max should be stuck with that big guy.

461
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,980
他太猥瑣了
He's not cool.

462
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,150
我剛在那邊
I was just over there,

463
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,140
他唯一感興趣的尖尖角在她身上
and the only pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

464
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,860
我說的是她的咪咪  主廚
Talkin' boobies here, Chef.

465
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,370
約翰大廚  迪克大廚
Chef John, Chef Deke here

466
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,260
似乎覺得你在性騷擾麥克斯
Seems to think you are sexually harassing Max.

467
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,030
拜托喲
Oh, please.

468
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,190
如果人家要性騷擾別人  那人肯定是你
If I was harassing anyone, it would be you, Chef.

469
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,800
你的魅力無法擋嘛
I mean, come on.

470
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,420
馬上回來  姐們兒
Be right back, big Mary.

471
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,860
你真懂我
You know it.

472
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,990
我的果汁呢  都過了一個小時了
Where's my juice? It's been an hour.

473
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,700
情緒波動的精靈去拿了
The mood swing elf's getting them.

474
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
聽著  我要進去跟尼古拉斯主廚賣騷
Look, I'm coming in there To flirt with Chef Nicholas,

475
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,670
當我進去的時候  我要你說
and when I enter, I need you to say,

476
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,640
"卡洛琳  你看起來美呆了"
"Caroline, you look amazing."

477
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,470
不行
No.

478
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,570
我的身體不允許我說出這種話
I actually physically can't say that.

479
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,920
我寧愿沖進去大喊
I would rather walk in there and yell,

480
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,470
"我有陰虱  剛剛有三只逃跑了"
"I have crabs, and three of them just escaped."

481
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,780
快叫救護車  快叫救護車
Call 9-1-1. Call 9-1-1.

482
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,650
那個可愛的混血男出事啦
Something's happened to the adorable mixed-race one.

483
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,630
迪克
Deke?

484
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,660
他有糖尿病  他需要打胰島素
He's diabetic. He needs insulin.

485
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,590
這里有人會打針嗎
Has anyone here ever administered a needle?

486
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,230
"打針"就跟"把針插進去"的意思一樣  對吧
Uh, administer means the same thing as "shove it in," right?

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,490
很好  很好  麥克斯  你過來
Good, good, good, Max. Come, come, come.

488
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,940
好的  他的注射器在腰包
Okay, uh, his syringes are in his fanny pack.

489
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,280
老實說  我之前干這種事時
I've actually never done this

490
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
都得聽著重金屬搖滾樂
without Iron Maiden playing in the background,

491
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,340
但我來打打看吧
But I'll give it a shot.

492
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,700
在我性感的身軀上隨便打一針就行
Just put it anywhere in my hot bod.

493
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,630
上帝保佑
God help us.

494
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,450
我討厭針  我不敢看了
Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.

495
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,380
女士們  別驚慌失措好嗎
Get it together, ladies.

496
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,190
所以醫生不准我抱小孩
This is why I'm not allowed to hold babies.

497
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,360
麥克斯  從現在開始你和迪克一組
Max, I think you and Deke should be lab partners from now on

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,250
以防今天的事再次發生
in case something like this happens again.

499
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,590
-沒問題吧  -我別無選擇
- Is that okay? - I guess if I have to.

500
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,820
麥克斯  你呢
Max?

501
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,110
我也別無選擇
I guess if I have to.

502
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,150
你是故意不按時打胰島素嗎
What, did you not take your insulin on purpose?

503
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,670
人家真的很想做你搭檔嘛
I really wanted to be your partner.

504
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,540
碧碧  我在這里找不到大廚上衣
Bebe, I can't find a Chef jacket anywhere in here.

505
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,320
很抱歉  我知道我不應該穿那個
And I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to wear one,

506
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,590
但我真的很冷
but I'm really cold,

507
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,680
我不能一天都穿著這身衣服走來走去
and I can't walk around like this all day.

508
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,130
或許我可以幫你
Maybe I can help.

509
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,600
你不能又濕又冷地站著
You can't stand there wet and cold.

510
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,880
-穿我的上衣吧  -不  不
- Take my jacket. - Oh, no, no, no.

511
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,040
不用了  那也行
You don't have-- oh, that'll work.

512
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,630
不好意思我里面沒穿衣服
I'm sorry about the no shirt under,

513
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,700
我上課的時候  總是覺得很熱
but I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

514
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,060
是啊  熱  太熱[性感]了
Yeah, hot. So hot.

515
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,690
我的天啊[法語]
Oh mon dieu.

516
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,050
我正准備[射]給卡洛琳呢
I was just giving it to Caroline.

517
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,770
我是說  她需要換件衣服
I mean, she needs something to wear,

518
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,840
我就把我的給她了
and--and now, she has it.

519
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,020
大廚  晚點見
Chef, I will see you later.

520
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,180
卡洛琳
Caroline.

521
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,490
麥克斯  我我找到讓我性致昂揚的東西了
Max, I think I found something to keep me interested.

522
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,180
這下奇怪了  現在我成了好學生
This is weird. So I'm the good student now?

523
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,430
而你卻成了跟老師上床的那個
And you're the one sleeping with the teacher?

524
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,710
我們又沒上床
We're not sleeping together.

525
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,600
干嘛這么說  你覺得他想要我嗎
Why? Do you think he wants to?

526
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,520
我不知道  但在胖子姐們兒扑過去前
I don't know, but you better hurry it up

527
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,570
你最好早點下手
before big Mary gets him.
