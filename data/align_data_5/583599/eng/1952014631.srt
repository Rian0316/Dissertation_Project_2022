2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,500
- hello, Mrs. Limoges.
- Call me laurel.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,600
My daughter left me 2 grandchildren,

4
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,100
rose and sage.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,400
Their grades are lousy.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,900
You want me to be their tutor?

7
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,000
How's megan?

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,365
She settlin' in, makin' friends?

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,300
No, she already told me
that she wasn't ready to date.

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,100
What does it matter?
You're already dating her sister Lily.

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,800
That girl totally just hit on you.

12
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,300
What if I was your girlfriend?

13
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,300
Uh, well, you're not.

14
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,065
- You're out with sage?
- No big deal.

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
It is a big deal, Lily.
She's 16 years old.

16
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,665
She's not even allowed in a bar.

17
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,300
I thought you were calling
to be nice to me.

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,500
I was!

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,700
all right. Close your eyes.

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,500
Imagine you and me...

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,300
massaged on adjoining tables,

25
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,100
scented oils burning
as our stress melts away.

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,000
What kind of scented oils?
Jasmine or sweet almond?

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Whatever you like.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Now, back to those adjoining tables.

29
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, I'd vote sweet almond,
'cause jasmine makes me phlegmy.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,200
OK. Mood is officially killed.

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,200
Sorry. Allergies.

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,500
No, it's OK. I just,

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
you know, I was a little
out of my comfort zone,

34
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:14,000
getting all sexy, sexy
on the phone, and then,

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,400
all of a sudden, phlegm,
and... well, anyway...

36
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,265
can we go to the spa now?

37
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,365
I don't think I can wait
to this weekend.

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Neither can I, but we must
have patience, grasshopper.

39
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,800
Patience, schmatience.

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,200
I have got a knot
so deep in my neck,

41
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,400
it's almost a bone.

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,500
I've named it sage.

43
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
I take it your job's not
getting any easier on you.

44
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,365
Uh, let me put it
to you this way.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,700
This is my first weekend off
in almost 3 months.

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
Ohh. Other line. Hold, please.

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Hey. Charlie, can I call you back?
I'm on the other line with jacob.

48
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:48,300
I just need 2 seconds.

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,100
Uh, OK. Hold on.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,065
Hey. So that's Charlie,

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
and he needs to talk
to me for a second.

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,100
Well, I gotta get
back to work anyway.

53
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,100
But don't forget
to pack your bathing suit,

54
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,065
unless you're a skinny-dipper,

55
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,650
which by the way,
I'm completely fine with.

56
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,200
Glad to hear it.
Not gonna happen, but...

57
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll call you later.

58
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,565
Hey. Charlie. What's up?

59
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,900
You never called me back
about the white stripes tickets,

60
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,967
and scotty needs
to know if we still want them.

61
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, crap, I totally forgot.
What's the date?

62
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,000
The 23rd.

63
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,700
It's my sister. Hold on.

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,965
Hey, Lily. What's up?

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Finally. Have you not been getting
any of my messages lately?

66
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,100
Yeah, I have.
I've just been really busy.

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
- I'm actually on the other line, so...
- I just wanted to apologize

68
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,100
about what happened
the other night with sage.

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,065
I had no idea she was so young.

70
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,800
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, she did have an I.D.,

71
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:39,800
but whatever.

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,350
I'm sorry, OK?

73
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,300
Yeah. Fine.

74
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,765
Doesn't sound fine.

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,750
What do you want from me?
I hate to say it,

76
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,700
but "I'm sorry" means
nothing coming from you.

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,465
What?

78
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,765
I mean, you say, "I'm sorry",

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,700
but then you do the same crap
over and over again, so what's the point?

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,365
The point is I'm trying to be nice.

81
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,700
Iook, I can't talk
right now. I gotta go.

82
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,100
Hey. Rose, um...

83
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,000
sorry. Sister on the phone.

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,100
Do you need anything?

85
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,800
No. I just left my books in here.

86
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,900
Well, we could go over that
last chapter together if you want.

87
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:16,100
You know what?
Just come get me whenever.

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
Yeah. OK. Bye.

89
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Megan, a word, please.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
I'll see you in my office.

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,100
- Hello.
- You gonna leave me on hold forever?

92
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,700
Oh, Charlie, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about you.

93
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:32,965
- Yeah, I know.
- You know what?

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.
Can I call you later?

95
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,100
Megan...

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
I'm sorry, laurel.
You wanted to talk to me?

97
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,365
As you know, I've been
called to a board meeting

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
in St. Barts this upcoming weekend,
very last minute.

99
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,917
- Yeah. It sounds exciting.
- Not exactly.

100
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,400
A few business dinners,
a lot of ego stroking.

101
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:54,700
St. Barts may as well be St. Iouis.

102
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,265
Oh. OK.

103
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,700
In any case, my granddaughters
are taking advantage of my absence

104
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,817
by throwing a little pool party.

105
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,900
They think I don't know about it.

106
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
But then I'm sure you're
already aware of their plans.

107
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,200
Uh, actually, I... I wasn't.

108
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,800
That's very disappointing, megan.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,665
First rule in business...

110
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,800
always be more prepared
than your superiors.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Excellent rule, and normally
I would be all over it,

112
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,500
but since I'm also
leaving this weekend,

113
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,100
maybe the girls slipped it by me.

114
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,800
First time off in 3 months.

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
We discussed it last week.

116
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,100
Yes, well, we also discussed
how the job requires flexibility.

117
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
It would be extremely helpful to me
if you could stay

118
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,600
and chaperone the ***.

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,900
Of course. Um...

120
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
I'll just make some calls.

121
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:46,700
Wonderful.

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,300
Just keep things under control.

123
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,200
And, uh...

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,900
hopefully you can
take next weekend off.

125
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,900
OK, we're up to 65 "hell, yeah"s,

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
12 "bummer,
I'm on my deathbed"s,

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
and 2 "have not replied"s.

128
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Let me guess. Breckyn and jordanna.

129
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
They seriously need
to get over themselves.

130
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
I don't know. I feel kind of bad.

131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
This was an emergency situation, rose.

132
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,565
We had no idea laurel
was going out of town this weekend,

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,100
and we definitely didn't know everyone
was gonna ditch their party for ours.

134
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,300
OK, that, we knew. But whatevs.

135
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Work it out with
your therapist, people.

136
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,900
What's going on?

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Nothing. Just school stuff.

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,500
School stuff or pool party stuff that
I'm not supposed to know about?

139
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,700
Marco told you.
He is so fired.

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Stop firing people.

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,300
Marco didn't tell me.
You girls are underestimating me.

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,500
OK, this is an impenetrable force.

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,500
I am all-knowing, all-seeing.

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,700
Laurel found out.

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,065
Yeah. The woman's good.
But come on.

146
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
I mean, did you really think that
you would get away with it?

147
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,900
She would find out eventually.

148
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Yeah, but by then, we would
have already had the party,

149
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,200
so who cares?

150
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
She's not gonna
make us cancel, is she?

151
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,400
No, but she is making me chaperone.

152
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,865
Forget that. I'd rather cancel.

153
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
Please. I happen to be
an excellent chaperone.

154
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,165
In fact, I was a quasi-chaperone

155
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
for a few of my own
high school dances.

156
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
I worked the punch bowl.

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,700
It was a very popular station.

158
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,400
Oh... my God.

159
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
I have to go have
an aneurism right now.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't worry. I will be
as invisible as humanly possible.

161
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
Your friends won't even
know that I'm there.

162
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,300
No, I know. And don't worry.

163
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,165
This isn't gonna be
a high school party.

164
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,500
Older people are coming.
Actually will's gonna be there.

165
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,000
Excellent. Yeah, I'll bring enough
bengay for the both of us.

166
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,765
That's... an arthritis ointment.

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Sorry. I just tuned out for a second.

168
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,400
OK, I just thought of
a really great idea.

169
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,100
Megan, you have a guest downstairs.

170
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
I do? Is it a boy or a girl?

171
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,000
Hold on. Let me guess.

172
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
It's Charlie.

173
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
Not really much for games,
are you, rami?

174
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Hold that thought.

175
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Hey.

176
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
You have a butler.

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,600
Well, not my own personal butler.
He comes with the house.

178
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,465
Did we have plans tonight?

179
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,800
No. Just figured it's easier to
catch you in person these days.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
You're not so great with the phone.

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Oh, crap. I totally forgot
to call you back.

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
A few times, actually.
Are you mad at me or something?

183
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
What? No, no, no. No.
Why would you think that?

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
You keep blowing me off...

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,100
our surfing lessons,
the white stripes concert.

186
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,500
Scotty gave the tickets away.

187
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,100
It doesn't matter,
but seriously, are we not cool?

188
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,717
No. No, no.
Of course we are.

189
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm... I'm so sorry, Charlie.

190
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,300
I have been completely
wrapped up in my own world,

191
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:58,200
which is no excuse,
because you deserve better.

192
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,400
No worries. I just wanted to...

193
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
you know, check in.
That's all.

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,300
Uhh! This job is a complete
black hole of time suckage.

195
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Did I tell you that I had to cancel
my trip with jacob this weekend

196
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
just to chaperone
the girls' pool party?

197
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,900
I didn't even know about the trip.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Well, it's not happening.

199
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,200
And of course I can't
bring jacob to the party,

200
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,200
because no one knows
that we're dating,

201
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,100
and, well, plus I think it
would be weird for the girls

202
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,765
to see their headmaster in a speedo.

203
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Oh, if the man wears a speedo,
I cannot allow you to date him.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Anyhoo, it is probably
going to be a disaster.

205
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,200
Luckily will is gonna be there,
so hopefully he'll be helpful.

206
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,400
Why would will be there?

207
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a party. He's a billionaire.
Those things kinda go hand in hand.

208
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,600
Well, listen, if you
need help, I'm around.

209
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,000
No. Charlie, I cannot
ask you to do that.

210
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
No, I know you can't.
That's why I'm offering.

211
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:49,000
It's no big deal.

212
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
- Really?
- Absolutely. It'll be fun.

213
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,465
Charlie, you are my hero.

214
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, what would I do without you?

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,500
Well, she didn't say
I had to cancel my plans,

216
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:02,000
but it was definitely implied.

217
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,700
So why don't you just imply
that you'll chaperone the party

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,100
and not do it?

219
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,600
Technically not lying.

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Please don't hate me.
I feel terrible already.

221
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,400
What about all the scented oils
and the skinny-dipping?

222
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,265
Well, look at the bright side.

223
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,500
There was never gonna be
any skinny-dipping.

224
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,600
- That's what you thought.
- Heh heh.

225
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,400
Hey, rose.

226
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
I guess that means you have to go.

227
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,700
Yep. I'll call you back.

228
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,100
What's up?

229
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
OK, OK, so I was
thinking about the party,

230
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,017
and I came up with this great idea,

231
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:34,100
and I just wanted to run it by you.

232
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,700
Are we talkin' themes here?
Because I rock at themes.

233
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,300
Actually, it's... it's
about the guest list.

234
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,765
I wanted to add one more person.

235
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh. Oh, I'm sure that'll be fine.
We have plenty of food.

236
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Ooh, but the thing is
I want you to invite her.

237
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,700
- Your sister Lily.
- Heh heh. Yeah, right.

238
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
And I hear Charles manson's
up for a parole pretty soon.

239
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,600
Maybe he wants
to catch some rays, too.

240
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,765
Rose...

241
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm not gonna invite Lily.

242
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,600
Why not?

243
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Look, OK, I know that you two
have your stuff to work out,

244
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:13,200
but I mean, she's still your sister,

245
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:17,100
and I mean, you're so...

246
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm so...

247
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,200
what?

248
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,500
You're so mean to her.

249
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,465
Iook, I'm only saying this

250
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
because you are so nice
to everyone else.

251
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,965
I mean, you are even
nice to sage,

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,400
who kind of wishes you
were dead. No offense.

253
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:34,900
None taken, but...

254
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,565
rose, I'm not mean to Lily.

255
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
You were kind of
harsh on the phone.

256
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:40,165
Well, yeah, but...

257
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,600
and plus you just compared
her to a serial killer.

258
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
OK, well, Charles manson was
more of a cult leader, but...

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
I get your point.

260
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,300
Rose, I've given Lily
a lot of chances.

261
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,400
So give her one more.

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Why is this so important to you?

263
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,600
Because you're my friend,
and I just...

264
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,400
I want you to be happy.

265
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,500
I am happy.

266
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,265
Yeah, except for when you're
on the phone with your sister

267
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,000
and your shoulders clench up past your
ears and your voice gets all tight.

268
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Plus, I think you and me,
we have a lot in common.

269
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,400
You know, like how we both
grew up without moms and...

270
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,665
well, even though you had a dad,

271
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,100
he obviously wasn't that great
since you never talk to him.

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
That's true.

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,300
So, OK, yeah, Lily,
she's kind of insane,

274
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,900
but at least she's trying.

275
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
And you are always the one that
tells me it's the effort that counts.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, OK. I'll invite her.
But I'm warning you.

277
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,700
Lily is a disaster.

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,200
This is your China shop.
If you wanna invite the bull...

279
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,500
olayé> baby.

280
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh!

281
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,100
- OK, good night.
- Night.

282
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Hello. Welcome.

283
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,200
Rose and sage are just right outside.

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
Hi. Welcome.

285
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
- Don't forget to wear your sunscreen.
- Where's the pool?

286
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,250
Oh, uh, it's just past the
patio, across the lawn,

287
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,700
and if you hit the ocean,
you've gone too far.

288
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Holy crap on a stick.

289
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,365
Are you kidding me with this place?

290
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,500
I got blisters just
coming up the driveway.

291
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,600
Hey, Lily. I'm glad
you could make it.

292
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,600
No problem. I was pretty surprised
to get your message, actually.

293
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Wasn't expecting it after you were
such a bitch to me on the phone.

294
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Try and watch your language, Lily.
This isn't one of your biker bars.

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Tell me, does that high horse you
sit on ever chafe your ass checks?

296
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
See? That wasn't so bad.

297
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

298
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:56,400
Yay, me.

299
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,365
Stop scowling, sage.
You'll get wrinkles.

300
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Marco, wait. You're not
even listening to me...

301
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,300
funny that. I see your lips moving,
but I can't hear anything.

302
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,165
It's not like anything's
going to happen...

303
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,700
you're right on that account.
I've already spoken to laurel.

304
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
- But she's not even here, marco.
- I have strict orders.

305
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:26,000
No one under 21 drinks alcohol.

306
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,900
Are you trying to ruin my party?

307
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Because this is so unfair.

308
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Breckyn! Jordanna! I'm so
glad you guys decided to come.

309
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:35,600
Hi.

310
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,300
Really miss this.

311
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,965
Oh, we thought you
were mad, but honest,

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,900
we did not know that laurel was
going out of town until last minute.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Oh, it's cool. My parents
are on safari for another month.

314
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:45,500
We'll have our party next weekend.

315
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh. You might wanna wait
on that a little bit.

316
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
I mean, you wouldn't want
people talking about our party

317
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,700
when they're at your party, right?

318
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Heh. Oh, look.
There's Alexander.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hey, what's up, ladies?

320
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm gonna go say hi.
Have fun, girls.

322
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
Breckyn, are those new guccis?

323
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,165
Aren't they awesome?

324
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
I got them in, like,
5 different colors.

325
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,165
Yeah? I have a pair, too.

326
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, I meant to tell you. Perry called
and said he's going to be late.

327
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,500
Weren't you supposed to be goin' out
with the boyfriend this weekend?

328
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,700
Heh. I know.

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,600
I just couldn't bear the thought
of not chaperoning a baker twins bash.

330
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,100
And for the record,
I wouldn't call him my boyfriend.

331
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:35,300
Really? What would you call him?

332
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,665
Well, I'm not really into labels.

333
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,600
I mean, they aren't
really necessary, are they?

334
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,100
I would say that he's someone whose...

335
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,000
company I enjoy, and
it's progressing nicely.

336
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
You want me to help you with that?

337
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,900
Yes. Heh. Thank you.

338
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,865
So, um, I invited Lily.

339
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
She's out by the pool.
I hope that's OK.

340
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,765
Uh, well, yeah, OK.

341
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Why... why wouldn't that be OK?

342
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,465
Oh, I, um... I just
wasn't sure, you know,

343
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,000
where you were in the whole
label-making process, so...

344
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,265
well, I'd say that
we're progressing

345
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,000
at a much more casual pace
than you and jacob, but...

346
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,700
it'll be good to see her.

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,300
- Good.
- Although I am,

348
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,000
a little bit surprised.
Aren't you guys in a fight?

349
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:19,500
Perpetually. Yes, this is
all part of my effort

350
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,200
to evolve and become
a better human being.

351
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
- One more?
- Duty calls.

352
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,400
So you just want me to just
stick this somewhere in that flower?

353
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,565
- This one.
- Yeah.

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,800
Hair pinning really isn't my thing.

355
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
- Oh, no.
- *****

356
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
hey!

357
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,600
Sorry to interrupt,

358
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,465
but we need a system to
figure out who's over 21,

359
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,200
because no one looks their age,
and they're all asking for drinks.

360
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,700
I was supposed to be
in the spa this weekend.

361
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh, uh, will, Charlie.
Charlie, will.

362
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,200
You boys entertain yourself.

363
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,800
I have to go attend to
the future felons of America.

364
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,065
How you doin'? Heard a lot of
good things about you.

365
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah, I've heard about you, too.
You're dating Lily, right?

366
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,400
I guess. Yeah, we hang out.

367
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,400
No, I just couldn't figure out
what she was doing here,

368
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,300
but now it makes sense.
She's here with you.

369
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,100
Actually, no.
Megan invited her.

370
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,700
Right.

371
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,065
Wait, seriously?

372
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah. Yeah, she said somethin'
about wanting to evolve.

373
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,700
Oh, no.

374
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,300
I take it you don't think
that's a good thing.

375
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
No, I know it's not a good thing.

376
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, I don't know.
I thought it was kind of cool.

377
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,265
You don't know them
as well as I do.

378
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,000
Trust me, the two of them
aren't going to evolve anytime soon.

379
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Well, if you say so.

380
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Anyway, it was good
to meet you, Charlie.

381
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,500
I tried to get the drinks, but...

382
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,500
but I told breckyn
that she is a guest,

383
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,900
and that I would carry 'em over.

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Okey-dokey,
we have 3 virgin mojitos,

385
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,965
4 virgin margaritas,

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,600
and a virgin vodka
soda for you, sage,

387
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,400
which is pretty much just soda.

388
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,300
Enjoy. Let me know when
you want your next round.

389
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,200
Can someone please just drown her?

390
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,900
No one likes a virgin.
Tequila, anyone?

391
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,800
- Whoo, yes.
- Yeah.

392
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh, that flask is so cute.

393
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,600
Alexander, what would
we do without you?

394
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

395
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,200
What are you doing in here?

396
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,100
Relax. I'm just
looking for a beer.

397
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,265
Well, the bar's outside.

398
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,600
But the line's shorter in here.

399
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,365
Give me a break, Lily.

400
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
I didn't invite you over here
to get into another fight.

401
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,000
Then why did you invite me?

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,300
Sorry. Marco just needed
some more mint.

403
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Iook, Lily, I know I've
been hard on you lately.

404
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,700
"Lately."

405
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,100
But I don't want that
to be our dynamic.

406
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,300
You're my sister, and I love you.

407
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,665
I thought it would
be nice to show you

408
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
what I've been up to
for the past few weeks.

409
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,100
You know, see where I'm working.

410
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
Want a tour of the house?

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
OK.

412
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,400
Oh, my God, you did not.

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
- I.c., I am so glad you could make it.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

414
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
Who's that chick with tyler?

415
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,900
Ehh. I don't know,
but she's a total flatso.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
I know, right?
She's like a human pear.

417
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,800
- So mean.
- What? Because you've always

418
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,600
way too nice, I.c.

419
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,700
You wouldn't last
a day at cielo prep.

420
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,500
I'll catch up
with you in a bit.

421
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,000
So, here's to amazing friends
who throw amazing parties.

422
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,200
Well, I'll drink to that.

423
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,300
Cheers.

424
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,065
- No way!
- I know.

426
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,565
I could fit my entire apartment

427
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,700
- into one of their closets.
- I know.

428
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,900
Here's what I don't get.

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
9,000 rooms in this house,

430
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,000
and the two of them
still decide to share?

431
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,400
Well, it's not so weird
when you know 'em.

432
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,700
They're really close.

433
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I guess.

434
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
God.

435
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,000
I moved into the garage
just to get away from you.

436
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,300
Yes, despite the asbestos problem.

437
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah, but I thought it was
a fake word you made up.

438
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,800
- You did?
- I did.

439
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I thought you were using
your fancy vocabulary

440
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,900
just to try to freak me out.

441
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,200
When I got that horrible cough
that wouldn't go away...

442
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:41,000
oh, yeah. I thought you were dying.

443
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,300
I remember that.

444
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
You were so nice to me that week.

445
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Lily...

446
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,900
remember how I used to bounce your
mattress from the lower Bunk?

447
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,800
Yes, I do. I think that's why
I still get seasick.

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,100
Oh, and remember
those glow-in-the-dark stars?

449
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,217
Those little stickers
you put on the ceiling.

450
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,300
And you'd make up
those crazy-ass stories.

451
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,465
Because you were afraid of the dark.

452
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
You would make me talk to
you until you fell asleep.

453
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
I knew you were gonna be a writer,

454
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
even then.

455
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
I knew.

456
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,600
So, um...

457
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,900
how did dad take it
when he found out I was back?

458
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,300
I didn't tell him.

459
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Really?

460
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,200
Look...

461
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
I get why you stopped talking to dad.

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,100
He's a total disaster.

463
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,700
I just never knew why you
stopped talking to me.

464
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,400
Lily, I...

465
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,200
I never meant
to shut you out. I just...

466
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,765
- ***
- excuse me, miss Smith.

467
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Your assistance is
needed down by the pool.

468
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,665
- I should go.
- No worries.

469
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,100
Iook, I really... I wanna talk
to you about this, seriously.

470
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm really glad
you're here, Lily.

471
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
Go take care of rich people.

472
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,100
I have to use the bathroom.
You gonna watch me pee?

473
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Here you go.

474
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Marco, your martinis are
almost as good as your omelets.

475
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,700
I aim to please.

476
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,265
In fact, you should
make a pitcher of these

477
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,900
and set it aside for megan.
I'm sure she could use it.

478
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:32,700
Megan's not much of a drinker.

479
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Oh. Didn't know that.

480
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,600
Yep. Lily is.

481
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,700
OK.

482
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh, I'm just saying.

483
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,900
- You know, there's a...
- yeah, what are you sayin'?

484
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,000
- Look at me squeezing limes.
- Hey, look,

485
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm not trying to start anything.
You just seem confused. That's all.

486
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,100
I mean, which one of the Smith
sisters are you interested in?

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,900
Or do you like them both?

488
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,900
Wow. OK.

489
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,100
Well, I like megan a lot
as a friend, which is what we are,

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
and I'm pretty sure that
that's what you guys are.

491
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,700
She's my best friend.

492
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Excellent. Glad to hear it.

493
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,200
So are you worried about her?

494
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Should I be?

495
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
No.

496
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,000
Because despite what you think,
no one here is confused.

497
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Megan and I are friends.
Lily and I are... dating casually.

498
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,965
Not that it's any of your business,

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,700
but we're all pretty clear
about the situation.

500
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
In fact, the only one who seems
confused right now is you.

501
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,600
I'll catch you later, marco.

502
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,665
Shall I extract your foot
from your mouth now,

503
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,000
or you would like to keep it
in there a bit longer?

504
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,665
OK, I don't wanna jinx anything,

505
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,765
but I think this could be
our best party ever.

506
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,700
Did you see megan and Lily?
They are totally bonding right now.

507
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm gonna hurl.

508
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,100
Uhh. I think Alexander put way
too much tequila in my drink.

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,865
I could get you some ice cubes.

510
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,300
I think that helps
with the pukey feeling.

511
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,200
I don't know.

512
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm just so dizzy.

513
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,700
What's that?

514
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
What's what?

515
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,265
OK, don't freak out,

516
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,765
but I think something bit you.

517
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,500
You've got a thingie on your cheek.

518
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,500
Oh, my God.

519
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,200
Oh, my God.

520
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, my God.

521
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,765
What is going on with my face?!

522
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,500
Look, don't worry. A little
makeup will cover it up, right?

523
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,065
Oh. Iook, if that doesn't work,

524
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
we can always put
a hello kitty band-aid on it.

525
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,165
Yeah, I'll wear one, too.
We'll say it's a theme.

526
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Oh, my God. There's one on
myneck, and it totally itches.

527
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,500
Don't itch. Don't itch. Don't itch.

528
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh, no.

529
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,900
What? Is there one on my back, too?

530
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
My tennis bracelet, it's gone.

531
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,400
They're getting worse.

532
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,700
Megan, we need you!

533
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,900
Intercom.

534
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Freaks me out every time.

535
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,800
OK, this looks a little weird.

536
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,500
OK, a few things have happened
that are kind of bad.

537
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,500
First of all, I'm dying.

538
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
You're what?

539
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,900
Oh. Those are just hives.

540
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,500
How do you know?

541
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,465
Because I've had them before,

542
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,200
and it looks like a pretty
mild allergic reaction.

543
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,600
Good thing is you're not swollen.

544
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,200
What'd you eat today?

545
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,100
Nothing. All have had
today was carrot sticks.

546
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,400
And buckets full of alcohol.

547
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah, but I know I'm not allergic
to tequila, so that can't be it.

548
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:54,100
Who gave you tequila?

549
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,065
Oh, my God.

550
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,200
Megan, we really need to focus
on the big issues right now.

551
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,865
Guess what! You girls
drinking is a big issue!

552
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
I can't believe that you
would go behind my back like this.

553
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,200
OK, somebody stole my tennis bracelet.

554
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
What?

555
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,865
It's a diamond bracelet.

556
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,600
- You don't actually play tennis with it.
- Wait. I know what a tennis bracelet...

557
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,000
what do you mean someone stole it?

558
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:14,165
I don't know. It's missing.

559
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
I always put it in the same place,
and it's gone.

560
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm telling you, it's gotta
be that new housekeeper.

561
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,600
She's totally shady.

562
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
It's not the new housekeeper.

563
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,100
Damn it.

564
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,700
We'll discuss you girls drinking later.

565
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
OK? And I'll have marco
bring up some calamine lotion.

566
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,200
- Wait!
- What?

567
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,200
Is that gonna give me zits?

568
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,500
Charlie, get everyone's drinks.

569
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,165
- Are you serious?
- Someone's spiking the punch,

570
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
and I don't have time here
to figure out who can drink,

571
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,800
nor is it my top priority,
so all cups must be redeemed.

572
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:48,865
OK, calm down. What happened?

573
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,600
What happened?
The girlare getting wasted.

574
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,400
Sage's face has exploded for reasons
that I don't yet understerstand.

575
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:56,000
But right now,
I've gotta go kill Lily.

576
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,300
- I'll take care of the drinks.
- Thank you.

577
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,400
Iook, I don't wanna make a scene.
Just give back the bracelet and go.

578
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm not gonna call the cops,
and nobody has to know.

579
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,000
Just give it back, OK?

580
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,300
- What are you...
- rose's bracelet.

581
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,700
I left you upstairs alone
in their room, and you stole it.

582
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
Ah, here's the megan
I know and love. Welcome back.

583
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,400
I can't believe
you would do this to me.

584
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,300
I didn't do anything to you.

585
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,700
Don't walk away from me.

586
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,965
Screw you. I'm not gonna
stay here and be attacked.

587
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm not gonna let you
steal from people that I care about.

588
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,100
I love how you care about them!

589
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,200
I've tried to care about you, Lily,

590
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,000
but you make it impossible.

591
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,700
I go out of my way to be nice to you,
to give you an opportunity.

592
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,765
Opportunity?!

593
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,200
Yes, an opportunity
to act like a grown-up,

594
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,065
to prove that you
could be a good sister.

595
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,665
I don't have to prove myself
to you or to anyone else.

596
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,600
Unlike you, I don't give a crap what
anybody here thinks of me.

597
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,600
I mean, you're so desperately
trying to fit in, it's pathetic.

598
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,265
You wanna spend
the rest of your life

599
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,100
kissing ass and trying
to make rich people like you?

600
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:05,700
- That's your problem.
- No.

601
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,500
You're my problem.

602
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,900
You always have been,
and you're never gonna change.

603
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,550
And you lie, and you cheat,
and you steal,

604
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:15,900
and you expect me
to cover up for you.

605
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,700
Well, I am done.

606
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,200
I want you gone.

607
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,065
I'm leaving.

608
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah, not just from this party, Lily.

609
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,000
I want you out of my life.

610
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,000
I want you out of my life forever.

611
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,100
You're being so lame.

612
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,700
My au pair let's me
do it, like, all the time.

613
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,965
Seriously. It's just an ice tea.

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500
Really? 'cause it smells
like it's from long Island.

615
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,400
Ooh. You mean like the hamptons?

616
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Sage?

617
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
Oh, my God. Iook at her face.

618
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,400
This is so classic.

619
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,550
Where's my cell phone?
I have to take a picture.

620
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm having an allergy attack.
It's no big deal.

621
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I love it. This is so much better
than we even thought it would be.

622
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,565
What are you talking about?

623
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
Yeah, what are you talking about?

624
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,600
OK, so don't be mad,
but we spiked your drink.

625
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,700
You did what?!

626
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
Oh, you totally deserved it.
You know you did.

627
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Wait. Wh...

628
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,650
what did you put in her drink?

629
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:43,165
Oh, it wasn't anything bad,

630
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,800
just some muscle relaxers I found
in my mother's medicine cabinet.

631
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:47,700
Yeah. They were just
supposed to make her mellow out.

632
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,500
- Smile.
- Oh, you bitches are so dead!

633
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Wow, wow, OK. *****

634
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,600
****

635
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,700
******* stop, stop!

636
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,300
What's going on here?

637
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
Don't look at me.
The girls have officially gone wild.

638
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,165
What are you doing?

639
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,065
They tried to poison me!

640
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,600
- Only because she stole our party.
- Oh, whatever.

641
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,100
Enough!

642
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Enough!

643
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,900
The case of sage's exploding face
has officially been solved.

644
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Apparently betty and Veronica here
thought it would be a good idea

645
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,100
to put muscle relaxers
in sage's drink.

646
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,800
Do you know how dangerous that is?
You girls could have killed her.

647
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,700
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

648
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,565
I don't understand this.

649
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,100
I thought you guys were friends.

650
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,700
- We are friends.
- Yeah.

651
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,800
Or hijack each other's parties
just because they can.

652
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,000
You girls wanna know
what a real friend is?

653
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,200
This guy right here.

654
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,100
You think Charlie wanted
to spend his Saturday

655
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,700
monitoring your alcohol intake?

656
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,300
No. He had way better things to do,

657
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,200
but he's here because of me,

658
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,800
and that's what friendship
is all about, ladies.

659
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
It's about loyalty. It's about
being there for the other person

660
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,200
when they need you most.

661
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,700
Kind of sounds like having a dog.

662
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
It kinda does.

663
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,300
You know what?
All right. Party's over.

664
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,100
- What?
- But it's so early.

665
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,300
We'll do the picnic
on the next time.

666
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,400
Let's go. Move it out.
Come on. Let's go.

667
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,400
Ugh, you are being so lame.

668
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,800
Nobody would have
shut down our party.

669
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,400
- Shut up, jordanna!
- No, you shut up!

670
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,400
Can you believe it?

671
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,600
Megan is sending everyone home.

672
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,900
Who cares?

673
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,300
This party is a total disaster anyway.

674
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't think it's a total disaster.

675
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
Yes, it is.

676
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,565
I mean, your face looks like pizza,

677
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,100
and I've permanently destroyed
megan and Lily's relationship.

678
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
They're probably never even
gonna speak to each other again.

679
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
I'm sorry.
How is that your fault?

680
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,300
Because if I hadn't told
megan to invite Lily,

681
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,100
none of this would have happened.

682
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Please. You didn't know Lily was
gonna turn out to be a criminal.

683
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,100
I know.

684
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
It was just a stupid bracelet.

685
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,600
I got so crazy.

686
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,800
You know, I would never let a piece
of jewelry come between you and me.

687
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:16,500
Well, that's the difference
between us and them.

688
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,600
People like megan and Lily
never had nice things,

689
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,165
so when they finally
get something shiny,

690
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,700
they think it's more important
than their own family.

691
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Maybe.

692
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,200
I never made such
a big deal about it.

693
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,500
I mean, look. I've gote
11 other tennis bracelets,

694
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,700
and I'm always loaning 'em out,
so it's not like I need them.

695
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,900
I mean, seriously half the time,
I have no idea who has what.

696
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,500
Oh, wait.

697
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,300
Where are you going?

698
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,100
Doesn't look like pizza.

699
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,200
Good God, it's chaos out there.

700
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
Drinking alone?

701
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,865
- I'm an idiot.
- Oh, don't be silly.

702
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,000
I keep a bottle of cabernet under my
pillow for those just-for-me nights.

703
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,200
And the fact that I didn't
realize I'm an idiot until now,

704
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,900
makes me an even bigger idiot.

705
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,900
OK. I guess marco won't
be getting his quiet time.

706
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,000
What's the matter, Charles?

707
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm her friend.

708
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
And why is that a bad thing?

709
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,400
That's all I am to her,
and it's all I'll ever be.

710
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
OK, so what are you doing about it?

711
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Nothing.

712
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
- I mean, she's happy, right?
- Seems that way.

713
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:35,400
Right. So...

714
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,800
I don't wanna be the guy who
messes with his friend's relationship.

715
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,365
But I also don't wanna be the guy

716
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,100
separating drunk 16-year-olds
at some stupid pool party,

717
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
hoping his friend will notice him.

718
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Right?

719
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,100
This is where you jump in and say,
"no, it's definitely gonna happen.

720
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,600
Hang in there, buddy."

721
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,900
There's nothing worse
than unrequited love,

722
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
except of course losing
your hairline in your twenties

723
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,700
waiting for that person
to love you back.

724
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,200
I missed my window, didn't I?

725
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,200
Thanks for the talk, man.

726
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,300
Megan! I need to talk to you.

727
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,565
Rose, the party is over,

728
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
and do not mess with me
right now, because I am pissed off,

729
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
and you don't wanna mess
with me when I'm pissed off.

730
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:33,000
OK, Lily didn't steal the bracelet.

731
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
What?

732
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,565
I j... I just remembered
that my friend precious

733
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,265
really needed something to wear
to the fire and ice ball,

734
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,000
and look, she begged me to borrow it,
and I... I guess she never returned it.

735
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Are you kidding me?

736
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
How could you not remember
something like that?

737
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,200
I don't know.

738
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,600
Just I have so many,
I guess I lost track.

739
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Oh, my God.

740
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
I can't believe this.

741
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,200
I know. I am so sorry.

742
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,765
OK? Just please ask Lily
to come back here,

743
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,900
and I really need to apologize.
This is all my fault.

744
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Lily.

745
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,200
Lily, please.

746
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
What do you want?

747
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Would you mind if I, uh, talked to
my sister alone for a minute, please?

748
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah. Of course.

749
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Don't go.

750
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,300
I don't wanna be alone
with you right now.

751
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,300
Iook, I'm...

752
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,100
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
for accusing you of taking the bracelet.

753
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,400
Rose remembered that she
loaned it to a friend,

754
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:42,200
and I feel awful,

755
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,800
and I don't know why...

756
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
I was so quick to think
that you took it.

757
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,900
It's obviously something
that I need to work on,

758
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,700
but I want you to know that, um,

759
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm embarrassed, and...

760
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm so, so sorry, and I just...

761
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I just hope that you
can forgive me.

762
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,400
I'd like to.

763
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,000
But "I'm sorry" means
nothing coming from you.

764
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,200
I was so excited
that you invited me today.

765
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,000
I actually thought that
things might be different.

766
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,500
But you're never
gonna stop judging me,

767
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:35,100
and you know what?
I'm over it.

768
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,700
You want me out of
your life, I'm gone.

769
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,000
I'll meet you
at the place, will.

770
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,300
You must think
I'm a terrible person.

771
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,800
I try not to judge when
I don't have all the details,

772
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,700
but you were pretty hard
on her out there.

773
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I mean, it's obvious that
your sister likes to act tough,

774
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
but underneath, I think
she's pretty vulnerable.

775
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,200
I... I wish you were right,
but I know my sister.

776
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
Just look at what
happened here today.

777
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,200
Now, I may not know everything that
went down with you guys in the past,

778
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:17,300
but I saw this one
from start to finish.

779
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,900
This one's all on you.

780
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,900
Hey. You're not leaving, too.

781
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,365
Sorry. I gotta get goin'.

782
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I'm supposed to meet up
with some friends from work.

783
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,600
Don't tell me you're mad at me
about the whole Lily thing, too.

784
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
No, of course not.

785
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,365
Really? You don't think
I was too hard on her.

786
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,700
It's not like she hasn't
given you reason to be that way.

787
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Makes total sense
you jumped to that conclusion.

788
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,500
I would have done the same thing.

789
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,800
Well, then stay. Hang out with me.
We could do whatever you want.

790
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,000
I really gotta get goin', megan.

791
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,200
OK. Call me tomorrow?

792
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Sure.

793
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,800
Hey.

794
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,000
How'd it go with your sister?
Did you guys make up?

795
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Not exactly. I think it's gonna be
a long time before she talks to me.

796
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,900
Ah, I feel so bad.

797
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,665
I... I made you invite her here today,

798
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,000
and now everything's ruined
between you two forever.

799
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,300
No. No, you didn't make me
do anything, rose.

800
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,000
Tried to tell her that.

801
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
The damage between me and
Lily goes a long way back

802
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,300
it's gonna take more than
one party invitation to fix it,

803
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
if it can ever be fixed.

804
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,900
But it's OK.

805
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
How is that OK?

806
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,500
I mean, she's the only family
you talk to, and she hates you.

807
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,900
Yeah. That may be true for now,

808
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,200
but luckily I don't depend
on my sister for too much,

809
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:19,300
which is why my friendships
are so important to me.

810
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,000
And after seeing the way that you
and your friends treat each other,

811
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,500
I understand why that concept
might be a little foreign to you.

812
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,100
Heh. What are you talking about?
We love our friends.

813
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,600
Yeah. I mean,
breckyn and jo are the best.

814
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,200
They tried to poison you.

815
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,200
Agreed. They did go
a little far this time,

816
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,100
- but they did apologize.
- Yeah, and they felt really bad.

817
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,600
I mean, that counts for a lot.

818
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,550
Maybe this is all
a little over my head,

819
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:46,700
but for the record,
I think it's really sad

820
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,100
that you girls don't have friends that
you could share everything with,

821
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,900
that you can depend on,
you know, for the big stuff.

822
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,000
We don't need our friends for that.

823
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,600
That's why we have each other.

824
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,200
Yeah, exactly.

825
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Hmm. All right.

826
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm gonna hit the hay.

827
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,100
Good night, girls.

828
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Night, megan.

829
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
Don't forget to call precious.

830
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Hmm? What for?

831
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,300
To get your bracelet back.

832
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,900
Oh. Right.

833
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
First thing tomorrow.

834
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,200
Can I help?

835
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Or can I go dig myself a ditch in
the backyard and bury myself in it?

836
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,600
Don't be silly. We have people
here to dig the ditch for you.

837
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,500
Why so gloomy, red?

838
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm not gloomy.

839
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,900
I don't know. It's just...

840
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,200
it's kind of tough having
zero relationship with my sister

841
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:55,400
and then seeing what it
could be like.

842
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,565
They're really sweet
with each other.

843
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,300
Well, they have to be.
Who else is gonna like them?

844
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,400
Megan.

845
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
You have a guest waiting
for you in your room.

846
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
Don't you wanna ask me
if it's a boy or a girl?

847
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,900
Not really, rami,

848
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,500
but I appreciate the effort.

849
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,500
Jasmine or sweet almond?

850
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
Courtesy of Mr. Jacob Cassidy.

851
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,800
You know what? Let's just
forget today ever happened.

852
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600

Tonight is all about
