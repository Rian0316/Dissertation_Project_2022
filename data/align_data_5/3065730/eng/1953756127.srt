1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,238
My siblings and I
are the first vampires

2
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:05,356
in all of history,
the original family.

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:09,777
3 centuries ago, we helped build
a town called New Orleans.

4
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:12,646
Now a plot by witches
has lured me back,

5
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,866
hopping that I will
defeat a tyrant,

6
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,651
a vampire I created.

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,737
My brother hopes
I will find redemption

8
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:21,522
through the power of family,

9
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:22,823
a miracle child,

10
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,075
part werewolf,
part vampire, a hybrid.

11
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:27,795
My sister is doubtful.

12
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,363
She thinks I am
beyond redemption.

13
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:31,698
Despite my brother's
best efforts,

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,301
I have a plan of my own.

15
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,371
I will take back my home
and claim what was mine.

16
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,189
I will be King.

17
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:44,345
The city of New Orleans.

18
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,647
People of all stripes
and flavors

19
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:50,067
from all over the country come
here to party on our streets.

20
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:52,553
Some are just looking for fun,

21
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,557
some are looking for something
a little darker,

22
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,059
more dangerous.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,395
So we invite them
into my home,

24
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:02,896
and we give it to them.

25
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:16,394
Then at the stroke of midnight,
everything changes,

26
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:19,230
and it's time to feed.

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,076
This is how I keep
my guys happy,

28
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:33,795
the occasional
all-you-can-eat buffet.

29
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:35,547
My nightwalkers love it.

30
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:36,581
Got them working hard
trying to earn

31
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,466
one of these
daylight rings.

32
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,618
They deserve to blow off
a little steam.

33
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,637
My daywalkers,
the trusted few,

34
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:44,755
they just like to party.

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,094
It's quite
an operation.

36
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,813
Tell me, what
about the victims?

37
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,966
Seems like a lot
of graves to dig.

38
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,401
Can't kill them all.

39
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:59,103
Too many folks go missing,
tourism drops,

40
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:02,607
so we heal them
with a little vamp blood,

41
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,809
erase their memory,
send them on their way,

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,778
no muss, no fuss.

43
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,313
I'm impressed.

44
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,615
Nothing I didn't learn
from you back in the day.

45
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,984
Marcel.

46
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,152
What's up, Thierry?

47
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:15,754
6 of our guys
were killed in a bar

48
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,790
outside of the quarter,
nightwalkers.

49
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,542
No one saw who.

50
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:40,314

51
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,291
Elijah, if not
answering your phone

52
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,043
was part of your clever plan
to get me back

53
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,545
to this godforsaken city,
then well done.

54
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,214
I'm here,
and I'm worried.

55
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,166
Now pick up before I kick in
your bloody door.

56
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,205
Who the hell
are you?

57
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,140
Ahh. You must be
the maid.

58
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:11,092
My bags are in the car.
Get them, will you?

59
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,645
Hello. Not the maid.

60
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,980
Right. You're that
werewolf girl

61
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,381
my brother Klaus
knocked up.

62
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,549
I was expecting
to see some kind

63
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:20,985
of supernatural
miracle baby bump.

64
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,454
Guess you're not
showing yet.

65
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:23,888
It's Hayley, isn't it?

66
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:25,357
You have your
brother's manners.

67
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:28,610
And his temper, too,
so watch it.

68
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:29,744
Where's Elijah?

69
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,563
Beats me.
He's long gone.

70
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:34,532
What do you mean
long gone?

71
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,834
Well, one minute
he was here

72
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:38,069
making epic promises
about protecting me

73
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,405
in this predicament
that a bottle of scotch

74
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,674
and some bad decisions got me into,

75
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,575
he was all poetic
about how we're family,

76
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:48,213
and then Klaus
told he me bailed.

77
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:50,598
Guess that's what I get
for trusting a vampire.

78
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,667
Elijah is not just
any vampire,

79
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:55,136
and he doesn't
break promises,

80
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:57,889
which means Niklaus has done
something dastardly and Klaus-like.

81
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,525
Klaus, get out here
and tell me what you've done

82
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:03,862
with our brother, you narcissistic,
back-stabbing wanker!

83
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:06,698
Enough with all
the shouting.

84
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,566
Little sister.
I should have known.

85
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,569
I assume the 6 dead
vampires were your doing.

86
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,104
They were very rude...

87
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:14,406
Aah!

88
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,907
Trying to victimize
a poor, innocent girl

89
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,108
just trying to find
her way to the quarter.

90
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,214
So sorry. Were they
friends of yours?

91
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,649
Oh, that's right.
You don't have any friends.

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,902
I do have friends.
I have Marcel.

93
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,971
You remember him,
don't you?

94
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,622
Yes, of course
you do.

95
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:33,174
He fancies himself.
The king of quarter now,

96
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,460
and he has these rules
about killing vampires.

97
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,145
It will be fun to see
what sort of punishment

98
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,479
he comes up with
for you.

99
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:41,149
I don't care
about Marcel or his rules.

100
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,985
Elijah doesn't welsh
on deals.

101
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:45,635
What did you
do to him?

102
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,408
Perhaps he's
on holiday

103
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,278
or taking a long
autumn nap upstairs.

104
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,046
Well, go on.
Take a look around.

105
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,320
You remember this house
as well as I.

106
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,006
I remember
everything.

107
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,762
I remember how the drunken fool

108
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,663
of a Governor hid away
all our vampire sins

109
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,549
in exchange for gold.

110
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,223
I remember the lavish parties
the Governor threw

111
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,508
as if to impress you.

112
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,149
I remember finding
a moment of affection

113
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,351
with the Governor's son Emil...

114
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:42,627
And I remember that
even Elijah was happy.

115
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:46,080
Your brother,
he's gone too far.

116
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:49,199
Niklaus, there is no hope for you,
is there?

117
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,170
Are we interrupting?

118
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,171
Yes.

119
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,205
No.

120
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,640
Dearest Elijah,

121
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,559
you've only ever wished
happiness for me.

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,644
Emil and I are
in love.

123
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,896
Please let me
turn him.

124
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,681
Heh heh heh!

125
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,234
Rebekah, the Governor
has graciously agreed

126
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:10,054
to hide a lot of our...
Indiscretions.

127
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:12,557
It would not do to turn
his only son into one of us.

128
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,659
Please for me.

129
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,245
It's not gonna happen,
sister.

130
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,998
If we turned every man you
dropped your knickers for,

131
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,033
then human beings
would cease to exist,

132
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,451
and we'd have
no bloody food.

133
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,236
How dare you, sir!

134
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,871
You would do well
to... aagh!

135
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,090
Drop him.

136
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,091
Klaus!

137
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,210
Klaus, drop him.

138
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,244
Wait!

139
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:34,679
No!

140
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,585
Get him out!

141
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,189
Well, he wasn't
good enough for you.

142
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,958
No one was ever good
enough for me, Nik.

143
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,793
You made sure
of that.

144
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,728
Now where's Elijah?

145
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,699
Where are you going?

146
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,218
It appears the night
is not quite over yet.

147
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm off for another
drink with Marcel.

148
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:00,972
Elijah told me
your plan to take apart

149
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,907
Marcel's empire
piece by piece.

150
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,459
I don't remember it
involving you two drinking

151
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,077
New Orleans dry together.

152
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:08,779
I know you don't have
many friends, Rebekah,

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,299
but what some friends do when
they get together is they drink,

154
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,102
and when they drink,
they tell secrets.

155
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,137
Marcel has somehow
found a way to control

156
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,622
the entirety of witches
in the quarter,

157
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:18,923
and I aim
to uncover the how

158
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:22,075
so I might take it
for myself.

159
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:25,195
Finding Elijah didn't
make my to-do list today.

160
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:30,351
Oh. And welcome home,
little sister.

161
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:38,076
You, wolf girl.

162
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,028
I'm gonna search this
house inch by inch

163
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,831
until I find what my evil
brother has done to my good one.

164
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,033
You're helping.

165
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,456
The Governor had lots
of secret rooms.

166
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:53,490
I'll show you
his favorite.

167
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:06,170
You think Klaus
killed him.

168
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,773
We can't be killed,
silly girl,

169
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:10,308
but that doesn't stop Klaus
from finding ways

170
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,676
to torture us.

171
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:14,277
He has a set
of mystical silver daggers.

172
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,698
One in the heart sends
us into a deep slumber.

173
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,950
Klaus gets his jollies
from keeping us in a box

174
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,686
until he decides
to pull the dagger out.

175
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:25,523
That must be what he's done
to Elijah.

176
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,158
This one's mine.

177
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,860
He keeps your coffin
on standby?

178
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,029
He likes to be prepared
for when his family members

179
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,164
inevitably disappoint him.

180
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,866
Elijah's isn't here.

181
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,835
He must have stashed
him elsewhere.

182
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:39,302
I feel sick.

183
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,139
Welcome
to the family, love.

184
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,007
You should have run the second
your realized Elijah was gone.

185
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,659
Yeah. Well,
the witches have put

186
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,678
some sort of hex
on me.

187
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,212
As long as I'm
carrying this baby,

188
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:49,397
I can't leave
New Orleans.

189
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,215
If I do,
they kill me.

190
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,134
Well, knowing Klaus,
he's planning a box for you

191
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:56,521
the second you give birth to
whatever's cooking in your tum.

192
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:59,156
I'm leaving as soon
as I find Elijah.

193
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:03,894
Being daggered in a box
for decades sucks.

194
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,997
Trust me.

195
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:08,565
You best find a way
to break that hex and run.

196
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,277
Hello?

197
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,828
Seriously, Marcel?

198
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,313
Trying to scare me?

199
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,831
I had nothing to do
with the attack

200
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,700
on your guys last night.

201
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,435
Sophie Deveraux.

202
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,554
My brother Elijah
told me about you.

203
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:05,139
Know who I am?

204
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,475
Yeah, I know.

205
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,343
Then you know we
need to talk.

206
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:12,296
So if I had to guess,
knowing Klaus' history,

207
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:14,699
Elijah has a dagger
in his chest.

208
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,317
It's a magical object.

209
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:18,202
You're a witch.
Do a locator spell,

210
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,354
locate the dagger,
locate Elijah.

211
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,156
I can't use magic.

212
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,689
It's punishable
by death.

213
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,326
Marcel's rules.

214
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:27,361
Marcel? What do you think
I'm going to do to you

215
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,913
if you don't give me
what I want?

216
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:31,382
Not much.

217
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:32,800
I've been linked,

218
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,502
so anything you
do to me,

219
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:35,753
you do to Hayley.

220
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:36,887
Who?

221
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:39,206
Oh. Right.
The mumsy.

222
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,475
Well, luckily for you,
Elijah seems to care about her.

223
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:44,177
Otherwise, I'd break
your neck right here.

224
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,383
How did Marcel get
so bloody powerful anyway?

225
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,552
It wasn't like this
when I left 11 years ago.

226
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,154
Marcel has a way
to tell whenever

227
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,605
there's magic done
in the quarter.

228
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:56,157
The how isn't relevant.

229
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,658
I'll tell you what's
not bloody relevant.

230
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,726
A coven of witches
who can't do magic.

231
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,996
Here's an idea.
Move away.

232
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:04,331
We practice
ancestral magic.

233
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,250
This cemetery is
filled with the remains

234
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,733
of our witch ancestors.

235
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,704
Without access to them,
we're powerless.

236
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,740
If we run, we're leaving
our legacy behind,

237
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,962
our home, our family.

238
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:20,380
Well, family's overrated.

239
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,587
Look at me.

240
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:30,224
I'm back in a city that's
given me nothing but heartache,

241
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,226
looking for a brother
who's hell-bent

242
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,245
on protecting a baby
I don't care about.

243
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,897
I find that hard
to believe.

244
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,097
You're here,
aren't you?

245
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,433
I'm here for Elijah.

246
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,952
The instant I find him,
I'm gone.

247
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:44,121
He was the one who
idiotically believed

248
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,824
this baby would be
Niklaus' redemption,

249
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:52,213
and now he's missing, probably
at the hands of Klaus himself,

250
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,747
and you were foolish
enough to believe

251
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,050
that Elijah could convince
Klaus to go against Marcel

252
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,951
when everyone knows
that they have a history.

253
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,587
Klaus sired Marcel,
I'm aware.

254
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,638
You don't understand.

255
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,972
Marcel is not just
some guy

256
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:05,259
that Klaus turned
into a vampire.

257
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,627
Klaus loved him
like a son.

258
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,598
I was there the day
that they met.

259
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:13,601
We were burying Emil,
the Governor's only son.

260
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,804
Ow! Ow!

261
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,257
Turns out
the Governor had another son

262
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,026
from a mother that he owned.

263
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,362
Oww!

264
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,147
Owww!

265
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,666
What is your name?

266
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,188
Don't got one.

267
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,307
Mama wouldn't name
me till I turned 10

268
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,309
case the fever
took me.

269
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,193
Then it took her.

270
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,182
You're a survivor,

271
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:05,518
and survivors
need names.

272
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,691
How about Marcellus?

273
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,209
Marcellus?

274
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,547
It comes from Mars,
the God of war,

275
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,417
and it means
little warrior.

276
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,549
Perhaps there is hope for
our brother after all.

277
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,252
Klaus saw himself
in the boy.

278
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,221
He remembered how
our father used to beat him.

279
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,990
He, too, was
the bastard child

280
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:46,025
of a man who saw him
as nothing but a beast.

281
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:55,035
And that is why
your plan will fail.

282
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:59,540
All you've done is bring back
together two long lost souls.

283
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,508
Without Elijah
between them,

284
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,468
who knows
what they'll do?

285
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:15,772
Well, this is a far cry
from last night's party.

286
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:26,233
Ahh. In pursuit of the bartender
from Rousseau's, I see.

287
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,701
She's a work
in progress.

288
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,703
And yet here you are,
pining over her

289
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,289
when you should be
eating her for lunch.

290
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,376
Well, she must be special.

291
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,411
Business first.
The coroner called.

292
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,780
He's got my number in case
any dead tourists show up.

293
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:42,549
Let me guess. Dead tourists
with a stamp on their hand

294
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,051
and vampire blood
in their veins.

295
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,952
It happens.
Someone takes a drunken tumble

296
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,254
off a balcony or
into the Mississippi,

297
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:53,344
and today, I've got two
of them to deal with.

298
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,128
Excuse me, love.

299
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,797
What's that
you're studying?

300
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,849
Abnormal psychology.

301
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,185
Abnormal psychology. Well...

302
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:05,322
Perhaps you could help me
diagnose my friend over here.

303
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,808
He's been a little bit
depressed.

304
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,076
Can't keep his mind
off a girl.

305
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,815
He tells me she's a queen
fit for a King.

306
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,167
I think he should
cut his losses and move on.

307
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:20,838
What's your
professional opinion?

308
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,291
Be a nice guy,
and maybe the opportunity

309
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:27,160
will present itself
someday.

310
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,247
How about tonight,
9:00?

311
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:33,166
I'll meet you
right here.

312
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,518
I'll take it
under consideration.

313
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,940
Hmm. Harsh.

314
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,342
I daresay I've
lost my touch,

315
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,727
or you've lost yours.

316
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,067
Oh. Hey, hey, wait.

317
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,402
We're closed. Sorry.

318
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:53,070
I just need one teeny
tiny little herb.

319
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,521
Please.

320
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,873
Which herb?

321
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,491
Crushed aconite flower.

322
00:15:57,492 --> 00:16:00,711
Wolfsbane?
That's a poison.

323
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:03,030
Looking to kill a wolf?

324
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,914
Just a little one.

325
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,001
Give me a minute.

326
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,849
Cut it with jimson weed,
a few drops in some hot tea.

327
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,600
That should do it.

328
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,185
Here.

329
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,838
It's an ugly town
for wolves.

330
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,939
You're doing
the right thing.

331
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,402
Hey. Want to gain points?

332
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:45,372
Tell Marcel there's
a werewolf in the quarter.

333
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:49,092
You take me
to the nicest places.

334
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,748
Welcome to the land
of the newly dead.

335
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,183
I won't waste your time.

336
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,851
I trust you filled
them in.

337
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,587
To be honest, not much in
the way of potential here.

338
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:03,107
Yeah? Well, I just lost
6 nightwalkers.

339
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,942
I got wholes to fill.

340
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:06,527
I'll keep this quick.

341
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,094
That itch you feel,
that's the need to feed

342
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,313
coming on strong,

343
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:10,864
a hunger for human blood.

344
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,533
Drink it,
you're a vampire.

345
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,885
Don't, you die again,
this time for good

346
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:17,454
right here in a body bag.

347
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:18,739
Hey. What are you thinking,

348
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,323
cute, dorky girl
or gay best friend?

349
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,908
Dealer's choice.

350
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,944
Dealer's choice. Ok.

351
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:28,665
Whoever picks up this coin
gets to live forever.

352
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,783
The other one dies.

353
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,427
Damn, girl!
I said damn!

354
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,095
How could you?

355
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,430
Get over it, Josh!
It's not like I had a choice.

356
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,765
You would have done
the same thing

357
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,016
but you're such
a little, measly...

358
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,574
let her die
in cold storage.

359
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:57,110
Got a thing about people
who betray their own friends.

360
00:17:57,111 --> 00:18:01,481
Come on. Let's go
for a ride.

361
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:02,816
Go.

362
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,398
Attaque au fer.
Now counter-parry.

363
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,699
A hit! Palpable hit.

364
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,154
I'm gonna marry you
someday.

365
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:45,409
I would never marry someone
who couldn't best me in a duel.

366
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,192
Another lesson?

367
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,498
Huh!

368
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,204
Hyah!

369
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,870
Rebekah Mikaelson.

370
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,204
Come to teach me
another lesson?

371
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,588
Last time I saw you,

372
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,956
royal street was burning,
and you all

373
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:44,726
were fleeing the city
from your daddy.

374
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,293
Thought you
were dead.

375
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,462
You never looked back
to find out.

376
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,234
Why are you here?

377
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:55,370
Elijah. I think Klaus has
done something to him.

378
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:57,272
Stop. Stop right there.

379
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,941
If there's one thing
I've learned about you Mikaelsons,

380
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,277
it's don't get in the middle
of family feuding.

381
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,779
Doesn't end well.

382
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,013
There's nothing
going on between us.

383
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,448
I swear it on my life.

384
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:08,650
Your life means
something to me.

385
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:09,785
Give me the privilege
of honesty,

386
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:12,003
or that will cease
to be the case.

387
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,373
I like her,
and I think it's mutual,

388
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:17,008
but I haven't done anything
about it, and I wouldn't, not...

389
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,677
and you won't.

390
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,879
I love my sister,
but she lacks fortune

391
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,464
when it comes to men.

392
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:23,665
They come and go for her,

393
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,686
but I am the constant.

394
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,688
She's my family.

395
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,839
You said
I was family.

396
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:34,426
I have begged you to
turn me into a vampire.

397
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:39,781
And I told you I will turn
you when you're ready.

398
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:43,652
You go near Rebekah again,
and you never will be.

399
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:45,786
Even after
all you've achieved,

400
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,489
you're still scared
of him.

401
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,690
I'm not scared
of anyone.

402
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,697
If I find out you know
where Elijah is,

403
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,665
you needn't fear Klaus.

404
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,550
I'll kill you myself.

405
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,755
Nostalgia's
a blast and all,

406
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:06,508
but I can't help you.

407
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:08,143
It's nice seeing
you, though.

408
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,377
Good luck finding
what you're looking for.

409
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,330
I know that face.
Woman trouble.

410
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,398
You're a dick,
you know that.

411
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,400
Why didn't you tell me
your sister's back in town?

412
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:34,903
I thought it would be more amusing
for you to find out for yourself.

413
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:36,488
Is there anything else
that I need to know?

414
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,907
Only that she's grown
considerably more insane

415
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:40,542
in the last century.

416
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:43,545
Or maybe that it was her
who killed my guys.

417
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:45,514
Doubtful.
Unless that biker bar

418
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,883
is frequented by small-town
high-school quarterbacks,

419
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,634
I can't imagine
she'd be interested.

420
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:54,473
Yeah?

421
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,476
Just got a tip someone
saw a werewolf in Bienville Park.

422
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,528
Get a couple nightwalkers
to run it down.

423
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,613
Bring me back
its head.

424
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:03,097
Well, I guess that
solves the mystery

425
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:04,733
of the murdered
riffraff.

426
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:05,934
At least my sister's
in the clear.

427
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,452
About that.
I don't have time

428
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:08,870
for Mikaelson
family drama.

429
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:12,073
You're my guest.
Keep your sister in line.

430
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:13,708
I have a greater chance
of draining

431
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,510
the Mississippi
with a straw!

432
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,786
Come on, Hayley.

433
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:28,122
One upset stomach,
and all this stupid drama

434
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,257
is ancient history.

435
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:54,015
Dumb moving coming
into the quarter.

436
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,500
You're coming
with me, wolf.

437
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,318
I have had it
to here with vampires

438
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,787
telling me what to do!

439
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,821
Aah! Ugh!

440
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,993
Unh!

441
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:09,214
Now that is no way
to treat a pregnant lady.

442
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,232
I do hate bad manners.

443
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:21,731
This is why I told you
never to leave the house.

444
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:24,167
Werewolves are banned
in the quarter.

445
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,786
I had a plan,
and your little nighttime stroll

446
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:28,421
put it all in peril.

447
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:30,006
Leave him!

448
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,574
You've done enough,
don't you think,

449
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,343
leaving a trail
of bodies like

450
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,178
a roadmap
to my door?

451
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,914
If I hadn't overheard this lot
bragging about werewolf heads,

452
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,965
everyone here
would be screwed,

453
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,185
and don't give me
that crap about having a plan.

454
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:43,603
You've had all the time
in the world

455
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:45,104
to execute a plan,
and no one's seen you

456
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,089
do a damn thing!

457
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,926
Elijah made a deal
to protect your child

458
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:53,730
so that he could save you from
your selfish, rotten self.

459
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,097
You obviously don't
give a damn

460
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,866
about the child
or Elijah

461
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,735
because what have you
done to honor it?

462
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:01,888
I have done
everything.

463
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,374
Let me spell it out
for you, shall I?

464
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,960
From the day I arrived,
Marcel hasn't trusted me.

465
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:09,045
From day one, he's
had his vampires

466
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,246
ingest
toxic vervain,

467
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:11,614
which as you know,
little sister,

468
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,082
protects them from
my mind control.

469
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:17,720
I needed a spy,

470
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,222
someone on the inside
with me

471
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:21,724
who Marcel
would never suspect,

472
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:25,461
so I created a day zero
and got there first.

473
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:26,629
Unh!

474
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,646
Hey.

475
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,066
Marcel had just lost
6 vampires

476
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,801
thanks to your
little murder spree,

477
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,904
and he needed
new recruits,

478
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:37,273
so I made
the new one mine

479
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:42,979
before he'd had
even a drop of vervain.

480
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,914
Now let's have
a little chat

481
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:48,617
about what you can
do for me.

482
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,420
But we all know
the real way to a man

483
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:54,340
is through
his heart, so...

484
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,960
So my mate Marcel...

485
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:00,129
nice bloke,
don't you think?

486
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,131
No.

487
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:03,833
He's charming,

488
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,303
sexy, confident,
incredibly hot,

489
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:12,976
but let's be honest,
he's a bad boy, right, like you,

490
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,695
and right now,
I only need good in my life,

491
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:16,979
not someone who's...

492
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,314
tragically wounded
and damaged

493
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:22,785
by demons
he can't escape.

494
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:28,707
The damaged ones, they're not good,
at least not for me.

495
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:34,163
I understand, I do.

496
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:37,050
However, give him
one chance.

497
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:40,036
Then I need you to
tell me where he goes

498
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:47,427
and who he sees.

499
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:51,230
Compel him to believe
his mates found religion

500
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,348
and moved to Utah

501
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:53,983
so that he can
explain to Marcel

502
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:57,285
why he lost 3 more
vampires tonight.

503
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:06,663
Does anyone have
any more questions?

504
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:11,901
No. Good because
I have a question, Hayley.

505
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,237
What were you doing
in the bloody French quarter

506
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,073
in the first place?

507
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,423
Answer me!

508
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:19,575
Nik, leave her be.

509
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,678
You want to know
what I was doing?

510
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,681
I was buying poison
so I could put

511
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,415
your little baby
out of its misery.

512
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,253
Nik!

513
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:34,107
Nik!

514
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:35,525
Keep your hands
off her.

515
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,778
She is pregnant
for God's sake!

516
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,197
All of this bluster
about not wanting the child,

517
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:45,100
and then the second she tells you
she's ready to get rid of it...

518
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:53,109
It's ok to care.

519
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,962
It's ok
to want something.

520
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:57,764
That's all Elijah
was trying to do,

521
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:01,751
all he's ever
wanted for you,

522
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:05,070
all we've ever wanted.

523
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:28,277
I gave Elijah
to Marcel.

524
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,647
What?

525
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:34,617
Marcel was nervous.

526
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,120
It was bad enough one
original returned to town,

527
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:39,505
but two?

528
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:42,425
His crew was
getting antsy.

529
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,293
He wanted
Elijah gone,

530
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:49,132
so I gave him
a peace offering.

531
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,017
You bartered our brother.

532
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:54,237
I have a plan.

533
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,439
Gain Marcel's trust,

534
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,175
dismantle
his empire,

535
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:04,013
honor Elijah's wish
that that baby be born.

536
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:08,618
I am executing that plan
the only way I know how.

537
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,054
If you don't
like it,

538
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:14,072
there's the door.

539
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,661
See if I care.

540
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:49,630
I know you don't know me very well,
but thanks.

541
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,300
I appreciate what
you did in there.

542
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:55,837
Us girls have got to
look out for each other.

543
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:57,472
What is it
with you two?

544
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:59,107
I mean, you say
you hate him,

545
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:02,510
but the way you deal
with him, it's so clear.

546
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:06,565
Even when you hate him,
you still love him.

547
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:08,817
I guess when you spend
a thousand years with someone,

548
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:10,936
deciding to
quit them is like

549
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:14,656
losing a part
of yourself,

550
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:20,979
but sometimes,
the hate is just so powerful.

551
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,481
Emil wasn't
the only boyfriend

552
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:24,900
of mine that
Klaus killed.

553
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:27,035
He did it again
and again

554
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:29,638
every time I found
someone to care about.

555
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,039
He just kept
doing it

556
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,759
until finally I stopped
falling in love.

557
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:38,930
He said he was protecting
me from my mistakes,

558
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:45,404
that no one was ever good
enough for his little sister

559
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,688
until one day
someone was.

560
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,443
How was the river?

561
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:54,962
It's cool, sweet.

562
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,341
I should go inside.

563
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,844
My brother will kill you.

564
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:10,544
Then I'll
die smiling.

565
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,218
Did I not warn you?

566
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,719
Klaus, I beg of you!

567
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,421
He is not like any other.

568
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:21,273
You saw it in him
from the very first day.

569
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:23,391
You saved him,

570
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:26,328
protected him.

571
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:30,282
You raised him.

572
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:32,399
You cannot kill him.

573
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,630
You are right.

574
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:49,301
I cannot.

575
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:51,119
Ohh!

576
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,122
But you,
dear sister,

577
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:56,892
need a lesson
in what you can

578
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:59,643
and cannot take
from me.

579
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,587
If you know Marcel
has Elijah,

580
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,739
why don't you just
get him back yourself?

581
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,574
Because if I cross
my brother,

582
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:15,159
then there's still a coffin
downstairs with my name on it.

583
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,511
Oh, my God.

584
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:36,181
I found them
under your coffin,

585
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:39,451
so if a couple
of antique steak knives

586
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,520
were the only thing stopping
you from getting Elijah back,

587
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:44,004
then here you go.

588
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:01,772
I sent everyone
home for the night.

589
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:04,643
I am your
humble host.

590
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,711
Well, ok.

591
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,047
Extra points for flair.

592
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:11,549
And the night's
just started.

593
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:15,136
What made you
decide to come?

594
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:18,339
Everyone deserves
a chance.

595
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:20,708
You lied to me.

596
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:21,875
Where's my brother?

597
00:32:21,877 --> 00:32:23,028
Hello to you, too.

598
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:26,181
Cami, Rebekah,
Rebekah, Cami.

599
00:32:26,182 --> 00:32:28,016
I see you still have
a thing for blonds.

600
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:30,018
Hey!

601
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,686
Tell me where
Elijah is.

602
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:33,054
What the hell
is going on?

603
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,406
Tell me where he is,
or I will kill you!

604
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:43,530
No, you won't.

605
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:50,120
Perhaps you're right.

606
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,210
But I will kill her.

607
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,912
Let her go.

608
00:32:57,913 --> 00:33:01,765
You won. I'll take
you to see Elijah?

609
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,886
Ohh! What the hell
are you people?

610
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:07,305
Shh. It's ok.

611
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:09,591
Go home, forget all this,

612
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:11,893
and just know that
I will make it up to you,

613
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:15,864
I promise.

614
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,432
You want to
see Elijah?

615
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,950
Fine. Follow me.

616
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:35,750
Invite me in.

617
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,619
Got to ask the lady
of the house!

618
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,405
Davina, come on out,
sweetheart.

619
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:46,928
Invite her in.

620
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:48,429
Come in.

621
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:56,654
I wouldn't do that.

622
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,942
Who the hell
are you?

623
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:03,244
Davina.

624
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:04,746
She's an old one,
isn't she?

625
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:06,965
Yeah. Rebekah is
an original,

626
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:09,751
which means she
can't be killed.

627
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:12,821
She doesn't seem
very nice.

628
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:15,340
She can be,
but she hasn't been

629
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:17,759
very nice to me tonight.

630
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,344
Then I'm afraid it's time
for you to leave.

631
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,381
Aah!

632
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:42,056
Well, it's about time.

633
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,359
I was bored waiting,

634
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,829
but I did so want
to see your face,

635
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,265
and it is
indeed priceless.

636
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,183
You bastard.

637
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:52,718
What day is it?

638
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,002
Sunday.

639
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,704
I have been daggered
for a whole week?

640
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:58,173
Marcel... what have
you done to him?

641
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,377
It's 1887, Rebekah.

642
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,713
You've been daggered
for 52 years.

643
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:05,848
What?

644
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:07,082
And don't worry
about Marcel.

645
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,084
I presented him
with a choice.

646
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,053
He could choose
to undagger you

647
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:13,221
and live out the rest
of his human days with you,

648
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,441
or I could turn him
instead,

649
00:35:15,442 --> 00:35:16,992
as he's always wanted,

650
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,227
in exchange
for giving you up.

651
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:21,547
No. He wouldn't
do that to me.

652
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:24,249
Oh, but he did.

653
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,414
Welcome back,
Rebekah.

654
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:41,333
You were out
for quite a while.

655
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,136
Where am I?
How did I get here?

656
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:46,088
You upset Davina.

657
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,774
I'm glad you two
finally got to meet.

658
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,810
Now you know what
you're dealing with.

659
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:53,311
Is this my old room?

660
00:35:53,313 --> 00:35:54,897
Oh, it's mine now

661
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:57,366
just like this town is
mine, Davina's mine,

662
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:00,434
and Elijah's mine
until I feel like giving him back.

663
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:03,238
What was once yours,
what was once your brother's

664
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,156
it's now mine.

665
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:12,163
And don't ever touch
Cami again.

666
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,547
I didn't use it.

667
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,537
You're awake.

668
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,674
I could barely
sleep all night.

669
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:59,326
This house is like
a freaking swamp sauna.

670
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,768
What stopped you?

671
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:09,671
You could have been free
of all of this,

672
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:12,057
of me.

673
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:15,327
Yeah. Well, when I was
fighting off those vampires,

674
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:19,180
I realized I wasn't
just protecting myself.

675
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,486
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that

676
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:26,021
my birth parents
gave me up

677
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:29,073
and my adoptive parent
kicked me out.

678
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:33,412
All I know is
push came to shove,

679
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:38,217
and I realized I wouldn't
let anyone hurt it.

680
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:42,221
I'm beginning to think
we're a lot a like,

681
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:44,039
you and I.

682
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,059
We're both castoffs
who've learnt to fight

683
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,979
when we're backed
into a corner.

684
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,265
Well, we're backed
into a corner now.

685
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:57,102
Ah. That we are.

686
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:59,237
It's time to fight...

687
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,524
Little wolf.

688
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,531
This whole thing
with Marcel,

689
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:10,999
the deal you have
with the witches,

690
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,118
trying to take him down,
take what's his,

691
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,040
Rebekah told me that you two once
loved each other like family.

692
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,757
What happened?

693
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,934
I made Marcel
everything that he is,

694
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:33,188
I treated him like a son,

695
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:35,774
and when my father chased
me and my family

696
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,526
from New Orleans
a hundred years ago,

697
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:40,062
we believed Marcel
was killed.

698
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:44,316
We each mourned him
in our own way.

699
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:48,654
Yet when I returned,
I found not only had he survived,

700
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:52,090
he had thrived.

701
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:53,942
Instead of seeking us out,

702
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:57,462
instead of sticking
together as one,

703
00:38:57,463 --> 00:39:02,084
he made a choice
to take everything

704
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,370
my family had built
and make it his own.

705
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,622
Now he is living
in our home,

706
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:11,310
he is sleeping in our beds.

707
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:16,131
The letter "M"
he stamps everywhere,

708
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,984
it's not for "Marcel,"

709
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,652
it's for Mikaelson.

710
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:26,108
I want it all back,

711
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,912
and if I have to push
him out to get it,

712
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:32,613
then that's exactly
what I'll do.

713
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:39,170
I'll have somebody see
to the air conditioning.

714
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:50,299
You're right.
The girl Cami, she's the key.

715
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,267
Marcel likes her,
and because of that,

716
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:53,635
I got to see
the secret weapon

717
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:55,354
of his that you've
been going on about.

718
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:57,289
Well, don't stand
on ceremony.

719
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,507
What is it?

720
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,309
It's not a what.
It's a who,

721
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,344
a girl, Davina.

722
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:03,678
She can't be
more than 16,

723
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,982
and I have never
felt power like that.

724
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,150
A witch.

725
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:09,517
She's not just
any witch.

726
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:10,652
She's something I've
never seen before,

727
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:12,871
something
beyond powerful,

728
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:16,375
and now because of you,
she has Elijah.

729
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:18,410
Who knows what she
could do to him.

730
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,378
Where is she?

731
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:26,000
That clever bitch.

732
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:29,704
I don't know.

733
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:32,307
What's wrong?

734
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:35,844
She wiped my memory
of the location.

735
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:38,013
Marcel possesses
a weapon

736
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,681
bigger and more powerful
than an original,

737
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:41,716
and you handed our
brother to him!

738
00:40:41,717 --> 00:40:44,152
How many times will
Elijah forgive you?

739
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,355
How long until his hope
for your redemption

740
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,689
finally dies?

741
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,358
I did what I had to do!

742
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,359
Marcel took our home.

743
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,444
And our home
is worthless

744
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,528
without family.

745
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:02,620
I am finding Elijah,
whatever it takes.

746
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:07,459
Are you going
to help me?

747
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,760
Whatever it takes.

748
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:26,161
I'm sorry
about that unpleasantness.

749
00:41:26,162 --> 00:41:27,980
She doesn't scare me.

750
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,231
None of them do.

751
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:30,449
I didn't think
they would, honey,

752
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,783
but the thing is,

753
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:34,486
it seems like they're
here to stay.

754
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,856
They don't belong here.

755
00:41:37,857 --> 00:41:40,658
Might be kind of tough
to convince them of that...

756
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:46,580
Which is why I need to
ask you for a favor.

757
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,833
I'm gonna need you
to figure out

758
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,117
how we kill an original.

759
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,485
