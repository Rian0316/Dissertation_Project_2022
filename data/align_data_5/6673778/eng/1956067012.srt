1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,094
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

2
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:10,010
He can't believe it.

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:12,186
And neither can I.

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,405
Hi, Dad. How you doing?

5
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,064
Then by
the power vested in me...

6
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,327
by
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,679
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

8
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,204
You may kiss the bride.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,170
Good morning, wife.

10
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,435
Good morning, husband.

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,090
I can't believe
we're actually married.

12
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,092
It's official.
According to tradition,

13
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:50,615
we should hang
the bedsheets outside

14
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,010
so the villagers can see
that we consummated.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,751
I don't think that
that's appropriate,

16
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,101
considering where we're
starting our honeymoon.

17
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,147
Well, I suppose you're right.

18
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,673
Although,
when you think about it,

19
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:07,719
Lego is the perfect metaphor
for marital congress.

20
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:11,984
Two pieces that interlock
with a satisfying snap.

21
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:16,337
That'sthe sound you were making.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,642
I almost forgot.

23
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,776
While you were sleeping,
I ordered room service.

24
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,473
Really?

25
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,214
Voilà!

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,131
You thought it was going
to be food, didn't you?

27
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,076
Is it nice having Sheldon and
Amy away on their honeymoon?

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,861
Yeah, because now Leonard and
I get all this alone time.

29
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,428
But you're not alone.
We're here.

30
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,648
Yes. Yes, you are.

31
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:10,347
Would you like us to leave so
you and Leonard can talk about

32
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,088
all the things
you have in common?

33
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,961
Ha, ha, she called your bluff.

34
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,702
So, something
pretty cool happened.

35
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,922
Channel 3 asked me to be
on the news tomorrow night

36
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,315
to talk about the meteor shower.

37
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,012
That's great. Hey!
Congratulations.

38
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,164
You know, that's how Neil
deGrasse Tyson got his start.

39
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,755
He went from the
Hayden Planetarium

40
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,496
to guesting on the local news

41
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,716
to ruining everyone's
favorite movies on the Internet.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,196
Now it's happening to me.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,763
Ooh, I should probably
make a list

44
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:39,202
of all the scientific
inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.

45
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:42,205
You're gonna go on live TV and
admit you've seen that movie?

46
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,294
Hey, your husband's
the one who took me.

47
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,603
Meryl Streep andCher?
Yeah, I saw it.

48
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,174
Sounds like someone's in there.

49
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,177
My God, what if Sheldon
and Amy are getting robbed?

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,006
Or worse, what if
they're back early?

51
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,573
They're not; They
just posted a picture

52
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,053
in front of the
Statue of Liberty.

53
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,490
Real or Lego? Lego.

54
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,797
So, what should we do?
Should someone go check it out?

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,060
I would, but I got to
be on TV tomorrow.

56
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,193
Got to protect the money.

57
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,197
Yeah, someone's
definitely in there.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,676
Okay, let's go into
our apartment.

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,417
We'll lock the door,
we'll call the pol...

60
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,419
Hello?! Anyone in there?!

61
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,467
Yes? Mr. Fowler.

62
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,077
Sorry, we didn't
know you were here.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,340
We-we actually thought someone
was breaking in.

64
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,386
And we were ready
to take them down.

65
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,867
Amy asked me
to water her plants.

66
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,260
She doesn't have any plants.

67
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,264
Well, you caught me in a lie.

68
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,266
Have a good day.

69
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,361
That was weird, right?

70
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,059
Was it?
I-I honestly can't tell anymore.

71
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,410
Hey, did you even see
Mamma Mia 1?

72
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,455
Didn't need to.
The sequel stands on its own.

73
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,428
Here you go.

74
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,257
If you need any recommendations
while visiting New York,

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,650
please don't hesitate
to contact me.

76
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,696
Well, it is our honeymoon.

77
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,350
So we are going
to be quite busy.

78
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:24,873
Got it.

79
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,310
Harry Potterplay,
parts one and two.

80
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,095
And tomorrow,
a tour of the sites

81
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,273
where Nikola Tesla lived,
worked and slowly went crazy.

82
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,624
And, of course, coitus.

83
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,457
Well, enjoy New York.
And, I guess, coitus.

84
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,811
Really, Sheldon?

85
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,335
You want to do it again?

86
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,163
Don't act surprised.

87
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,078
It's clearly marked
on the schedule.

88
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,601
Now,

89
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,604
shall we steam the wrinkles
out of our wizard robes,

90
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:03,868
or make vigorous,
socially sanctioned love?

91
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:06,741
Either way, I can check
something off my to-do list.

92
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,787
Socially sanc... Wow.
Yeah, there it is right there.

93
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,140
Hurry. Raj is on next.

94
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,621
All right. I can't believe
they canceled Vampire Diaries

95
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,014
but they'll show this.

96
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,758
This is the news.

97
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,152
And that was a woman torn
between two hunky vampires.

98
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,806
What is your point?

99
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,377
Larry? I know you're in there!

100
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,509
Is that Amy's mom?

101
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,032
Let me in.

102
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,208
Let me in!

103
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,908
Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.

104
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,782
Larry?

105
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,175
Mrs. Fowler, are you okay?

106
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,222
I'm okay. It's my husband
you should worry about.

107
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,528
We do.

108
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,487
Larry, come on.

109
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,707
I don't think he's in there.

110
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,060
I mean, he came by to water
the imaginary plants,

111
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,670
but then he left.

112
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,498
You are so naive.

113
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,283
Blondie here is gonna
chew you up and spit you out.

114
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,461
Well, don't tell him.

115
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,856
Come on, you have an extra key.
Open it up.

116
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,381
All right, but I'm telling you

117
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,079
he's not in there.

118
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,561
There. See?

119
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,258
He's in here.

120
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,783
I can smell his Axe body spray.

121
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,568
He wears Axe body spray.

122
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,918
You happy? You smell
like Amy's dad.

123
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,618
Larry? Ooh, come on.

124
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:44,055
Shouldn't we mind
our own business?

125
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,971
Wow, sometimes it's like
you don't know me at all.

126
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,715
See, he's not here.

127
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,152
You don't know him like I do.

128
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,416
To be fair, we don't
know either of you.

129
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,855
Satisfied?

130
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,950
Yeah, now I smell him.

131
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:16,523
Man, that is one
hot weather girl.

132
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:19,351
How come if I say that
I get in trouble?

133
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,006
You want to say it?
You can say it.

134
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,145
Nice try.

135
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,452
You're gonna have to find
some other way

136
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,932
to not have sex with me tonight.

137
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,413
And it's not weather girl,
it's weather woman.

138
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,851
And with us today to talk about

139
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,960
the upcoming meteor shower and
the best places to view it,

140
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:47,684
Caltech astrophysicist
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

141
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,513
Thank you for being here.
Thank you for having me.

142
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,820
I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson
was unavailable.

143
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,562
Yeah.

144
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,435
What do you mean, "yeah"?

145
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,002
Not important.

146
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,178
So, what can we expect
to see from

147
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,875
this meteor shower?

148
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,487
Well, I think you can count
on a lot of flaming gas,

149
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,966
which is what
you would have gotten

150
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,100
from your first choice,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

151
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:15,364
Pull up, Raj, pull up!

152
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:19,324
Sounds like there's no love lost
between you and Dr. Tyson.

153
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,283
No, I love Neil.

154
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:24,155
I mean, not as much as Neil
loves Neil, but who does, right?

155
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,813
I want to look away,
but I can't.

156
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,816
You know, I'm told we
are out of time,

157
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,819
having learned nothing
about meteor showers

158
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:39,083
and too much about
Dr. Koothrappali.

159
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,695
Thank you.

160
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,180
Do you know what I love
about Broadway theater?

161
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,139
It's so interactive.

162
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:55,839
You're so close to the actors.
It's like you're in the play.

163
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,731
I mean, you yell,
"Harry, watch out,"

164
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,583
he looks right at you.

165
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,630
And not just Harry,
everyone onstage.

166
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,503
At the risk of sounding
redundant,

167
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,461
All right, well,
it's a bit late,

168
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,333
but I did block out
the rest of the evening

169
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,464
for conjugal relations.

170
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,292
Should we shower?

171
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,816
I mean before, not during.

172
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:18,296
That's how you fall
and break a hip.

173
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,535
You know,
I'm a little jet-laggy.

174
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,517
Maybe we can revisit this
in the morning.

175
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,650
No can do. If we miss tonight,

176
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,695
it's not scheduled
until Thursday at 600.

177
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,610
And that'll have
to be "no frills,"

178
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,308
'cause we've got a 630
reservation at Benihana.

179
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,660
Sheldon, do we really
have to do this on a schedule?

180
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,619
Are you suggesting spontaneity?

181
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,882
I-I guess, yeah.

182
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:42,364
So, now that we're married,
sex can occur at any time?

183
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,148
Like, we can be
brushing our teeth,

184
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,281
and suddenly your minty-fresh
tongue is in my mouth?

185
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,674
No, thank you.

186
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:50,633
Really? Would it be so bad
to mix it up a little?

187
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,940
Mix it up?
Who are you, Betty Crocker?

188
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,203
Where are you going?

189
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,683
To take a shower.

190
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,641
Now that sex can happen
at any time,

191
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,730
I always have to be ready.

192
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,298
Should probably live
under a waterfall.

193
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,363
Well, you don't have to worry
about sex happening tonight.

194
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:08,520
Well, thanks,
but I'm still gonna rinse off.

195
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,958
I touched a lot of stuff
in the gift shop.

196
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,573
No message, no note.
Who would do that?

197
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,792
What kind of husband would...

198
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,794
If you let him talk,
maybe you'll find out.

199
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:23,840
Fine. Larry?

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,151
Well, there you go.
What more can he say?

201
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,326
Let's go home.

202
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:34,372
I think I'll stay.

203
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,072
Well, if you're going to stay,
then I'll stay.

204
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,378
All right, well, you know
who doesn't need to stay?

205
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,597
Us. Come on.

206
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,994
Penny, come on.

207
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,125
Aw.

208
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:56,003
I don't think those two
are gonna make it.

209
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,709
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel
sorry for the little guy.

210
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,624
I know. After they had Amy,

211
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,801
she should've just eaten him
and been done with it.

212
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:15,979
Look at you retaining facts
from a nature show.

213
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:19,026
I know, really,
what did he ever see in her?

214
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,593
He's so, so sweet, and
she's such a ballbuster.

215
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,205
Some guys think
strong women are sexy.

216
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,009
Yeah, but they seem to have
nothing in common.

217
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:30,298
Yeah, well, sometimes
opposites attract.

218
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:34,302
Wait, are-are you saying
we are like them?

219
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,087
I don't know, maybe a little.

220
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:41,875
So you're the sweet, quiet one
and I'm Amy's mom?

221
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,268
Is that what you're saying?

222
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,541
Hey, check out what Neil
deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.

223
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,282
"I've been informed
that some random,"

224
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,631
attention-seeking nobody

225
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,460
"took a cheap shot at me
on the local news."

226
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:06,203
That's me.
Guys, he's talking about me!

227
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,075
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack

228
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,530
'cause you come
from another country,

229
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:12,340
but you've been here
a long time.

230
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,822
Raj, you need to apologize
to Dr. Tyson.

231
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,085
Why? This could be good for me.

232
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,478
Everybody loves
a good Twitter feud.

233
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,741
Neil and I could be like

234
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,613
the new, Katy Perry
and Taylor Swift.

235
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,267
Come on, Raj,
you're better than this.

236
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,790
Leave room for dessert

237
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,792
'cause I'm gonna
make you eat those words.

238
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:33,143
"Dear Dr. Tyson,

239
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,798
"much like epithelial tissue,

240
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,322
it appears I've gotten
under your skin."

241
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,803
iPhone drop,

242
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,675
but I won't
'cause I don't have AppleCare.

243
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:47,157
What'd he say?

244
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,640
"Nice try, genius.
The skin isepithelial tissue."

245
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,382
It's on.

246
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:58,560
He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.

247
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:05,872
What are you gonna do?
He's from another country.

248
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,486
And here we have
the former hotel where Tesla

249
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,315
perfected the three-phase
alternating current motor.

250
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,186
That's wrong.
I'm gonna say something.

251
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,753
Don't.

252
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,235
Well, then how will everyone
know I'm the smartest boy here?

253
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,019
Just let it go.

254
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,760
Is everything all right?

255
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,501
You seem testy this morning.

256
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:27,763
I'm not testy.

257
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,199
I'll have to take
your word for it.

258
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,985
There's no test for testy.

259
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,075
Is it possible that
you're sexually frustrated?

260
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,033
Okay, now I'm testy.

261
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,470
If you had adhered
to my coital schedule,

262
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,212
your brain would be floating
on a sea of oxytocin right now.

263
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,259
Don't talk to me about my brain.
I'm a neurobiologist.

264
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,914
Then you should know
the benefits of the special hug

265
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,872
that grown-ups give each other.

266
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,571
Sheldon, everybody's listening.

267
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,835
Of course they're listening;
We're interesting.

268
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,010
Unlike that guy.

269
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,622
I-I'm walking away from you.

270
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,803
I'm only recently married.

271
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,632
Do I stay here? Do I follow?
Say something useful.

272
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,990
Morning, sunshine.

273
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,169
So I see you're making espresso.

274
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,170
Yup.

275
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:28,998
Just need that extra jolt

276
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:32,654
for a successful day
of ballbusting.

277
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:35,831
Really? I don't,
I don't think you do.

278
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,226
You know, you compared us to
the strangest couple we know,

279
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,705
and we know Amy and Sheldon,

280
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:44,274
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his twitchy little dog.

281
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,755
I-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

282
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,757
Because it wasn't nice
or because it wasn't true?

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,715
It's not true.

284
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,762
Mrs. Fowler is an angry,
vindictive woman,

285
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,765
whereas you are warm
and-and loving,

286
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,332
quick to forgive.

287
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,160
Please.

288
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,337
I-I'm serious.
And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.

289
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,992
He's a mousy little man
who can't stand up for himself.

290
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,302
My point is you're not like her,
so we're not like them.

291
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,392
Well, 30 years from now,
are you gonna hide from me

292
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,046
because I'm so scary?

293
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,354
Hey, I-I don't think
you're scary.

294
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:23,531
Yes, I flinch when
you make sudden moves, but...

295
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,578
that says more about
my childhood than you.

296
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,928
Aw.

297
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,240
Your turn.

298
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,590
Hang on, I'm checking
to see if Neil replied

299
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,766
to my latest smackdown.

300
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,508
Really? Don't you think this
Twitter feud is a little silly?

301
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,945
Absolutely not.

302
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,947
It's-it's two
respected scientists

303
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,036
debating opposing views
in a public forum.

304
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,604
You called him
Mike Tyson's little sister.

305
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:57,521
Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's
mad at me, too.

306
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:02,613
Raj, you're not going to impress
anyone by attacking him.

307
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:06,182
Bernadette,
you sound so old right now.

308
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:13,494
He said he needs a break,
and I'm too much for him.

309
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,757
I'm sure he didn't mean that.

310
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,542
He said I'm overbearing!

311
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:22,459
Please, you're just
the right amount of bearing.

312
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,680
Look, I know he loves you.

313
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,378
If you just give him some space,
I'm sure he'll come back.

314
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,119
You really think so?

315
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,816
Yeah, I do.

316
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,646
You're a good person, Penny.

317
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,520
I hope we get to spend
lots of time together.

318
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,829
Me, too.

319
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,443
Yes? Hit the road.

320
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,836
But... Now!

321
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,621
Can I get my stuff?

322
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,493
Be quick about it!

323
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,719
Hello.Hello.

324
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,548
I brought you two hot dogs.

325
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,158
A-Aren't you gonna eat one?

326
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,726
From a street cart?
Are you crazy?

327
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,555
I'm amazed that
I'm holding them.

328
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,122
I'm not really hungry.

329
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:21,475
You realize that I'm not
a particularly physical person.

330
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:24,391
I know. When I was little,

331
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:27,089
and people asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,

332
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:30,266
I'd always say,
"A brain in a jar."

333
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,876
Sure.

334
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,357
Yeah, but I want to be
a good husband to you,

335
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:38,318
and intimacy is a part of that.

336
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,537
Please put those down.

337
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,757
I'm just worried
that if I don't schedule

338
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,934
our bedroom endeavors,
then I may not think about them,

339
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,415
and you'll grow cold and distant

340
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,767
and seek solace in the arms of
a heavily-muscled longshoreman.

341
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,509
Where would I find
a longshoreman?

342
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,554
Along the shore.
It's in the name.

343
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,387
Sheldon, I could never be
with anybody but you.

344
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,215
That's good to know.

345
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,912
I wouldn't want to fight a man

346
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:11,177
who's brave enough
to touch a fish.

347
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,398
How's this for a compromise?

348
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,272
Make all the schedules you want,
just don't tell me about them.

349
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,100
Excellent.

350
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,232
I'll create an algorithm
that'll generate

351
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,582
a pseudo-random schedule.
Yeah, and do you know why

352
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,758
it won't be a true
random schedule?

353
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,761
Because the generation
of true random numbers

354
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,373
remains an unsolved problem
in computer science.

355
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,722
Come with me.

356
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,265
Where are we going? To the hotel room.

357
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,029
And when we get there,
I'm gonna need you

358
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:40,554
to say that again, except naked.

359
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,965
Go for Dr. K.

360
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,967
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON
Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?

361
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,273
Yes. Who is this?

362
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,971
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

363
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,671
W-wow.

364
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,849
How fun is this Twitter thing?

365
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,807
You think you're funny?

366
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,854
I'm-I'm not Seinfeld funny, but
I did an open mic night once.

367
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,638
You're not funny.

368
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:24,337
Yeah, that's what they said
at the Chuckle Hut.

369
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,208
How about this

370
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:29,211
I've got a book signing at
Vroman's in Pasadena next week.

371
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:32,432
Why don't you come by and say
some of those things to my face.

372
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,781
No,

373
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,653
but thanks for the invite.

374
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:39,134
Smart move, and the next time
you pick up your phone,

375
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,878
remember, I'm the guy who kicked
Pluto out of the solar system.

376
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,185
And it deserved it, sir.

377
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,448
Thank you. Bye-bye.

378
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,495
Well, that was fun.

379
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,716
Let's see who else needs
a deGrasse kickin'.

380
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,027
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

381
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,379
Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson.
We've got to talk.
