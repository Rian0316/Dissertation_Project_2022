你能相信我們的小羊羔終于要嫁人了嗎
Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married?

25
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,420
他肯定不信
He can't believe it.

26
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,620
我也不敢相信
And neither can I.

27
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,210
爸  你還好嗎
‭Hi, Dad. How you doing?

28
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,850

真不敢相信我們真的結婚了
I can't believe we're actually married.

36
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,940
正式完婚了  根據傳統
It's official. According to tradition,

37
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,510
我們應該把床單掛在外面
we should hang the bedsheets outside

38
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,810
這樣其他村民就能知道我們行房了
so the villagers can see that we consummated.

39
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,830
我覺得這有點不太合適吧
I don't think that that's appropriate,

40
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,970
畢竟我們是在這里開始我們的蜜月之旅
considering where we're starting our honeymoon.

41
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,670
你說的有道理
Well, I suppose you're right.

不過如果你仔細想想
Although, when you think about it,

44
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
樂高有著形容夫妻房事的最完美隱喻呢
Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress.

45
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,730
兩片樂高"合體"并帶有爽度十足的咔噠聲
Two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap.

46
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,330
原來你當時發出的聲音是這意思啊
Oh, that's the sound you were making.

47
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,350
我差點就忘了
Oh, I almost forgot.

48
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,680
在你睡覺的時候  我點了客房送餐
While you were sleeping, I ordered room service.

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,560
謝爾頓跟艾米出去度蜜月你們是不是很爽啊
Is it nice having Sheldon and Amy away on their honeymoon?

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,510
是啊  因為我跟萊納德有大把的獨處時間
Yeah, because now Leonard and I get all this alone time.

54
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,130
但你倆不能獨處啊  我們在呢
But you're not alone. We're here.

55
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,400
是啊  你們在呢...
Yes. Yes, you are.

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,190
需要我們先行告退  好讓你們夫婦有空聊
Would you like us to leave so you and Leonard can talk about

57
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,830
你們之間有的共同話題嗎
all the things you have in common?

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,670
哈哈哈  吹牛被抓到了吧
Ha, ha, she called your bluff.

59

有件很酷的事情跟你們分享
So, something pretty cool happened.

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,420
第3頻道邀請我去上明晚的新聞

61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,920
去聊聊即將到來的流星雨
to talk about the meteor shower.

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,780
-那很棒啊  -恭喜你啊
- Oh, that's great. ‭- Hey! ‭Congratulations.

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760

You know, that's how Neil deGrasse Tyson got his start.

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,330
{\an8}美國知名天文學家  常上電視節目科普

Now it's happening to me.

70
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,350
或許我該開始列個表

71
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,170
寫下歌舞電影《媽媽咪呀2》中的科學不合理處
of all the scientific inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.

72
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,710
你確定要在電視直播中承認你看過這個電影嗎
You're gonna go on live TV and admit you've seen that movie?

73
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,760
是你老公帶我去看的

還可能更慘  是他們提早回來了
Or worse, what if they're back early?

78
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,990
沒回來  他們剛剛發了一張

我愿意  但我明天得上電視

明明白白寫在日程表上了
It's clearly marked on the schedule.

115

Now,

116
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,490
我們是應該先熨平我們巫師袍上的褶皺
shall we steam the wrinkles out of our wizard robes,

117
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,610
還是做一次激情并受社會認可的愛
or make vigorous, socially sanctioned love?

118
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,940
任何一種我都能消掉一項待辦事物
Either way, I can check something off my to-do list.

119
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,950
社會認...  哇靠  還真的寫了
Socially sanc-- Oh, wow. Yeah, there it is right there.

快點  馬上輪到拉杰了
Uh, hurry. Raj is on next.

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,710
我真不敢相信他們砍了電視劇《吸血鬼日記》
All right. I can't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries

122
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,060
卻留著這破爛節目
but they'll show this.

123
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,500
這可是新聞啊
This is the news.

124
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,990
那劇是在說一個女人為兩個帥壯吸血鬼左右為難
And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires.

125
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,120
你的點是什么

拉里
Larry?

福勒太太  你有什么事嗎
Mrs. Fowler, are you okay?

133
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,170
我沒事  你該擔心要出事的是我老公
Oh, I'm okay. It's my husband you should worry about.

134
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,270
我們有替他擔心
Oh, we do.

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,390
拉里  快開門
Larry, come on.

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
我覺得他應該不在里面
I don't think he's in there.

137
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,780
他當時來澆過不存在的植物
I mean, he came by to water the imaginary plants,

138
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,000
但后來他就走了
but then he left.

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,340
好傻好天真
You are so naive.

140
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,490
金發妹能把你生吞活剝吃干抹凈  再吐出來
Blondie here is gonna chew you up and spit you out.

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
你別告訴他嘛
Well, don't tell him.

142
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,690
快點  你們有備份鑰匙  把門打開
Come on, you have an extra key. Open it up.

143
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,150
好吧  但我告訴你
All right, but I'm telling you

144
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,420
他不在里面
he's not in there.

145
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,480
你看  沒人吧
There. See?

146
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,170
他絕對在這里
Oh, he's in here.

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,510
我能聞到他的斧牌身體芳香噴霧
I can smell his Axe body spray.

148
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,740
他用斧牌身體芳香噴霧呢
He wears Axe body spray.

149
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,860
你高興了吧  你聞起來像艾米她老爸
You happy? You smell like Amy's dad.

150
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,650
拉里  快跟去看
Larry? ‭Ooh, come on.

151
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,890
我們不應該少管閑事嗎
Ah, shouldn't we mind our own business?

152
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,460
有時候真感覺你完全不了解我
Wow, sometimes it's like you don't know me at all.

153
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,910
看到沒  他不在這里
See, he's not here.

154
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,290
你可沒有我了解他
You don't know him like I do.

155
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,010
老實說  我們對你倆都不了解
To be fair, we don't know either of you.

156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,740
滿意了吧
Satisfied?

157
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,010
對  我現在聞到他了
Oh, yeah, now I smell him.

158
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,970
天  這個天氣預報女孩可真辣
Man, that is one hot weather girl.

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
憑什么我說這種話就得送命
How come if I say that I get in trouble?

160
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,100
你想說嗎  你可以說呀
You want to say it? You can say it.

161
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,600
你想得美
Nice try.

162
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,080
今晚你得用其他的理由
You're gonna have to find some other way

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,790
來拒絕和我滾床單了
to not have sex with me tonight.

164
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,070
這不是天氣預報女孩   這是天氣預報女郎
And it's not weather girl, it's weather woman.

165
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,730
今天來給我們講解
And with us today to talk about

166
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,640
流星雨和最佳觀測地點的人是
the upcoming meteor shower and the best places to view it,

167
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,220
加州理工天體物理學家  拉杰什·庫薩帕里博士
Caltech astrophysicist Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

168
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,280
-感謝您的蒞臨  -感謝邀請
- Thank you for being here. - Thank you for having me.

169
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,940
我猜你們是沒請到尼爾·德格拉斯·泰森吧
I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson was unavailable.

170
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,710
沒錯
Yeah.

171
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,150
你說"沒錯"是什么意思
What do you mean, "Yeah"?

172
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,220
不是重點
Not important.

173
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,900
所以  這場流星雨的最大看點是什么
So, what can we expect to see from this meteor shower?

174
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,470
肯定會有很多可燃氣體接踵而來
Well, I think you can count on a lot of flaming gas,

175
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,490
如果你的首選之人
which is what you would have gotten

176
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,930
尼爾·德格拉斯·泰森有來  也會有很多[放屁]
from your first choice, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

177
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,240
停下來  拉杰  快剎車啊
Pull up, Raj, pull up!

178
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,960
聽起來你和泰森博士之間沒什么愛呀
Sounds like there's no love lost between you and Dr. Tyson.

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,850
不不  我可愛尼爾了
Oh, no, I love Neil.

180
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,330
雖然不如尼爾自戀  但誰能比得上呢
I mean, not as much as Neil loves Neil, but who does, right?

181
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,110
簡直不忍直視  但我眼睛舍不得轉
I want to look away, but I can't.

182
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,520
導播說我們已經超出時間了
Oh, you know, I'm told we are out of time,

183
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,490
流星雨一點沒認識到
having learned nothing about meteor showers

184
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,340
但對庫薩帕里博士卻了解了太多
and too much about Dr. Koothrappali.

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,170
謝謝收看
Thank you.

186
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,780
你知道我最愛百老匯劇場的哪一點嗎
Do you know what I love about Broadway theater?

187
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,660
就是那種互動的感覺
It's so interactive.

188
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,860
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

189
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,520
你離演員這么近  仿佛自己就融入了戲劇中
You're so close to the actors. It's like you're in the play.

190
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,430
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

191
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,380
如果你喊一聲"哈里  小心呀"
I mean, you yell, "Harry, watch out,"

192
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,830
他就會看向你
he looks right at you.

193
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,040
不光是哈里  臺上每個人都盯著我呢
And not just Harry, everyone onstage.

194
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,460
雖然可能會顯多余  嗯哼
At the risk of sounding redundant, uh-huh.

195
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,220
好了  天色已晚
All right, well, it's a bit late,

196
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,920
不過我已經留出今晚的余下時間
but I did block out the rest of the evening

197
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,690
來履行我們的"夫妻之實"
for conjugal relations.

198
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,210
我們該洗澡嗎
Should we shower?

199
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,720
我是說開始之前  不是中途
I mean before, not during.

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,320
人們就是這么滑倒摔破髖骨的
That's how you fall and break a hip.

201
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,290
我還在倒時差中
You know, I'm a little jet-laggy.

202
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,270
早上再說吧
Maybe we can revisit this in the morning.

203
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,490
不行  如果今晚不做
Oh, no can do. If we miss tonight,

204
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,880
就得等到周四的6點才能做了
it's not scheduled until Thursday at 6:00.

205
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,290
而且那場得是無前后戲的"快版"
And that'll have to be "No frills,"

206
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,710
因為我們6點半還訂了紅花鐵板燒的座呢
'cause we've got a 6:30 reservation at Benihana.

207
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,590
謝爾頓  我們必須要按時間表來做這事嗎
Sheldon, do we really have to do this on a schedule?

208
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,520
你是提議我們隨性而為嗎
Are you suggesting spontaneity?

209
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,840
我想是的
I-I guess, yeah.

210
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,320
所以因為我們結婚了  就可能隨時滾床單了嗎
So, now that we're married, sex can occur at any time?

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,200
比如  我倆正刷牙呢
Like, we can be brushing our teeth,

212
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,140
突然你那薄荷味的舌頭就伸進了我嘴里
and suddenly your minty-fresh tongue is in my mouth?

213
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,250
不  還是算了
No, thank you.

214
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,370
真的嗎  偶爾隨性地"炒飯"也不行嗎
Really? Would it be so bad to mix it up a little?

215
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,150
還炒飯呢  你誰啊  妙廚貝蒂[食品品牌]嗎
Mix it up? Who are you, Betty Crocker?

216
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,090
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

217
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,560
去洗澡
Uh, to take a shower.

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,170
既然現在我們隨時都可能滾床單
Now that sex can happen at any time,

219
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,840
那我就要時時做好準備
I always have to be ready.

220
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,520
我們不如住在瀑布底下吧
Should probably live under a waterfall.

221
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,220
你不用擔心今晚的份了
Well, you don't have to worry about sex happening tonight.

222
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,540
謝謝  不過我還是要去沖一沖
Well, thanks, but I'm still gonna rinse off.

223
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,630
我今天在禮品店碰了不少東西呢
I touched a lot of stuff in the gift shop.

224
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,060
沒有留信息  沒有留字條  誰會這么做
No message, no note. Who would do that?

225
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,460
什么樣的丈夫才會...
What kind of husband would...

226
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,670
如果你讓他說話  可能你就知道了
If you let him talk, maybe you'll find out.

227
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,620
好吧  拉里
Fine. Larry?

228
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,460
他說完了   無聲勝有聲
Well, there you go. What more can he say?

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,960
我們回家吧
Let's go home.

230
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,360
我想我還是留下吧
I think I'll stay.

231
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,400
如果你留下  那我也要留下
Well, if you're going to stay, then I'll stay.

232
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,620
好吧  你知道誰不必留下嗎
All right, well, you know who doesn't need to stay?

233
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,790
我們  快走吧
Us. Come on.

234
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,410
佩妮  快點
Penny, come on.

235
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,370
我覺得這兩人的婚姻不會長久啊
I don't think those two are gonna make it.

236
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,270
可憐的福勒先生  我真為他感到可憐
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel sorry for the little guy.

237
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,010
我知道  他們有了艾米后
I know. After they had Amy,

238
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,490
她就該把他吃掉算了
she should've just eaten him and been done with it.

239
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,220
看看你從自然節目中學到了不少啊
Look at you retaining facts from a nature show.

240
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,380
說真的  他到底看中了她什么呀
I know, really, what did he ever see in her?

241
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,490
他人這么和善  而她簡直是個潑婦
He's so, so sweet, and she's such a ballbuster.

242
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,720
有的男人覺得強悍的女人性感
Some guys think strong women are sexy.

243
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,820
可他們看起來也沒什么共同點呀
Yeah, but they seem to have nothing in common.

244
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,760
有時候異性才會相吸
Yeah, well, sometimes opposites attract.

245
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,150
等等  你是說我倆和他們一樣嗎
Wait, are-are you saying we are like them?

246
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,360
我不知道  有一點吧
I don't know, maybe a little.

247
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,890
所以你體貼又溫順  而我是艾米的老娘了
So you're the sweet, quiet one and I'm Amy's mom?

248
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,420
你是這個意思嗎
Is that what you're saying?

249
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,630
快看尼爾·德格拉斯·泰森剛才發了推特
Hey, check out what Neil deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.

250
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,690
"有人告訴我
"I've been informed that some random,

251
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,960
某個想出名的無名小卒
attention-seeking nobody

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,320
在本地新聞中無恥地攻擊我"
took a cheap shot at me on the local news."

253
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,730
是我耶  各位  他說的是我耶
That's me. Guys, he's talking about me!

254
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,400
看在你來自異國他鄉的份上
You know, I cut you a lot of slack

255
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,890
我一直對你優待有加
'cause you come from another country,

256
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,350
但你來美國也不是一天兩天了
but you've been here a long time.

257
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,360
拉杰  你應該向泰森博士道歉
Raj, you need to apologize to Dr. Tyson.

258
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,450
為什么  這對我有好處呀
Why? This could be good for me.

259
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,140
人人都愛看精彩的推特罵戰
Everybody loves a good Twitter feud.

260
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,640
{\an8}水果姐凱蒂·佩里和霉霉泰勒·斯威夫特曾在推特互懟

261
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,990
尼爾和我可以成為新一代的
Neil and I could be like

262
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,640
水果姐和霉霉
the new, uh, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.

263
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,100
拉杰  別這樣  你沒這么下作吧
Come on, Raj, you're better than this.

264
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,530
你肚子得留點空間吃甜點
Oh, leave room for dessert

265
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,100
因為我會讓你把說出來的話都吃回去
'cause I'm gonna make you eat those words.

266
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,310
"親愛的泰森博士
"Dear Dr. Tyson,

267
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,100
我就像上皮組織一般
much like epithelial tissue,

268
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,310
附在你的皮膚之下[讓你難受了]"
it appears I've gotten under your skin."

269
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,460
想摔手機耍帥
iPhone drop,

270
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,560
但不行  我沒有買蘋果保修服務
but I won't 'cause I don't have AppleCare.

271
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,820
他回了什么
‭What'd he say?

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,040
"加油啊  天才  皮膚本身就是上皮組織"
"Nice try, genius. The skin is epithelial tissue."

273
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,760
戰斗打響了
Oh, it's on.

274
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,340
他是水果姐  而我就是霉霉
He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.

275
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,780
你能怎么辦  他可是外國人
What are you gonna do? He's from another country.

276
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,750
這里就是特斯拉曾經
And here we have the former hotel where Tesla

277
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,960
完成三相交流電動機的前旅館
perfected the three-phase alternating current motor.

278
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,820
他說錯了  我得說點什么
That's wrong. I'm gonna say something.

279
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,740
別說
Don't.

280
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,580
不說大家怎么知道我是在場最聰明的孩子
Well, then how will everyone know I'm the smartest boy here?

281
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,110
你就別糾結了
Just let it go.

282
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,210
你沒什么事吧
Is everything all right?

283
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,880
感覺你今天早上挺暴躁的
You seem testy this morning.

284
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,080
我沒暴躁
I'm not testy.

285
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,610
那我只能相信你的話了
I'll have to take your word for it.

286
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,120
畢竟暴躁沒法測試
There's no test for testy.

287
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,640
你會不會是欲求不滿
Is it possible that you're sexually frustrated?

288
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,450
現在老娘真的暴躁了
Okay, now I'm testy.

289
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,880
如果你遵守我的交媾時間表
If you had adhered to my coital schedule,

290
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,900
現在你的大腦都漂浮在催產素的海洋里了
your brain would be floating on a sea of oxytocin right now.

291
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,970
別跟我聊我的大腦  我可是神經生物學家
Don't talk to me about my brain. I'm a neurobiologist.

292
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,440
那你就該知道大人給彼此的特殊抱抱
Then you should know the benefits of the special hug

293
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,170
能帶來什么好處
that grown-ups give each other.

294
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,180
謝爾頓  大家都在聽
Sheldon, everybody's listening.

295
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,450
他們當然在聽啦  我們這么有趣
Of course they're listening; we're interesting.

296
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,760
不像那位仁兄
Unlike that guy.

297
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,920
我要走了
I-I'm walking away from you.

298
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,430
我才剛結婚
I'm only recently married.

299
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,370
我該留在原地  還是追上去  說點有用的
Do I stay here? Do I follow? Say something useful.

300
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,200
早上好呀  小太陽
Morning, sunshine.

301
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,100
我看到你在煮濃縮咖啡
So I see you're making espresso.

302
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,000
是的
Yup.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,100
需要額外充電
Just need that extra jolt

304
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,700
才能順利當一整天的潑婦啊
for a successful day of ballbusting.

305
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,380
是嗎  你好像不喝也能做到
Really? I don't, I don't think you do.

306
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,750
你把我們跟世間最奇葩的夫婦相提并論
You know, you compared us to the strangest couple we know,

307
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,010
他們可是比艾米和謝爾頓
and we know Amy and Sheldon,

308
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,820
霍華德和伯納黛特  拉杰和他的神經小狗還奇葩
Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his twitchy little dog.

309
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,410
抱歉  我不該那么說
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

310
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,560
是因為那么說不好  還是因為那不是真的
Because it wasn't nice or because it wasn't true?

311
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,050
那不是真的
It's not true.

312
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,140
福勒太太是個易怒  報復心強的女人
Mrs. Fowler is an angry, vindictive woman,

313
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,600
而你是如此善良暖心  溫柔體貼
whereas you are warm and-and loving,

314
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,450
能快速寬恕別人的人
quick to forgive.

315
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,100
你少來
Oh, please.

316
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,750
我是認真的  再說我跟艾米的爸爸一點都不像
I-I'm serious. And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.

317
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,740
他就是個膽小如鼠  不敢捍衛自己的小男人
He's a mousy little man who can't stand up for himself.

318
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,510
我想說的是你不像她  所以我們不像他們
My point is you're not like her, so we're not like them.

319
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,170
三十年后  你會因為我很可怕
Well, 30 years from now, are you gonna hide from me

320
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,820
而躲起來嗎
because I'm so scary?

321
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,390
我不覺得你可怕啊
Hey, I-I don't think you're scary.

322
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,520
你突然動的時候我是會縮一下  但...
Yes, I flinch when you make sudden moves, but...

323
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,920
那更多反映的是我的童年問題  而不是你
...that says more about my childhood than you.

324
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,770
輪到你了
Your turn.

325
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,100
等等  我先看看尼爾有沒有
Hang on, I'm checking to see if Neil replied

326
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,740
回復我的怒懟
to my latest smackdown.

327
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,310
不是吧  你不覺得在推特上互懟很傻嗎
Really? Don't you think this Twitter feud is a little silly?

328
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
當然不會了
Absolutely not.

329
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,480
這是兩名備受尊敬的科學家
It's-it's two respected scientists

330
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,650
在公共論壇辯論相反觀點
debating opposing views in a public forum.

331
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,840
你叫他邁克·泰森的妹妹
You called him Mike Tyson's little sister.

332
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,840
{\an8}美國著名拳王

333
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,670
是啊  現在邁克·泰森也生我氣了
Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's mad at me, too.

334
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,110
拉杰  你攻擊他并不會讓人欣賞你
Raj, you're not going to impress anyone by attacking him.

335
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,190
伯納黛特  你口氣好老人哦
Oh, Bernadette, you sound so old right now.

336
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,480
他說需要喘口氣  他受不了我了
He said he needs a break, and I'm too much for him.

337
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,540
那一定不是真心話
Oh. I'm sure he didn't mean that.

338
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,630
他說我超級霸道
He said I'm overbearing!

339
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,990
才不是呢  您只是霸道得剛剛好
Oh, please, you're just the right amount of bearing.

340
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,250
我知道他愛你
Look, I know he loves you.

341
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,140
你給他點空間  他一定會回家的
If you just give him some space, I'm sure he'll come back.

342
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,910
你真這么想
You really think so?

343
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,260
真的
Yeah, I do.

344
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,880
你是個好姑娘  佩妮
You're a good person, Penny.

345
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,660
希望我們能多多相處
I hope we get to spend lots of time together.

346
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,300
我也是
Me, too.

347
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,440
-什么事  -上路吧
- Yes? - ‭Hit the road.

348
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,510
-可是...  -立刻滾
- But... - ‭Now!

349
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,220
我能去拿我的行李嗎
Can I get my stuff?

350
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,780
趕緊地
Be quick about it! ‭

351
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,210
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hello.

352
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,300
我給你帶了兩個熱狗
I brought you two hot dogs.

353
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,560
你不吃一個嗎
A-Aren't you gonna eat one?

354
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,820
這可是從路邊攤買的  你瘋了嗎
From a street cart? Are you crazy?

355
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,140
我敢用手拿著都夠讓我佩服自己的了
I'm amazed that I'm holding them.

356
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,820
我不是很餓
I'm not really hungry.

357
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,800
你知道我是個不太喜歡肉體接觸的人吧
You realize that I'm not a particularly physical person.

358
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,700
-我知道  -我小的時候
- I know. - ‭When I was little,

359
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,030
別人問我長大想做什么時
and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up,

360
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,100
我總是回答"裝在罐子里的大腦"
I'd always say, "A brain in a jar."

361
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,300
好吧
Sure.

362
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,580
但我想當個好老公
Yeah, but I want to be a good husband to you,

363
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,070
而親密關系是其中一環
and intimacy is a part of that.

364
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,120
拜托你先把熱狗放下
Please put those down.

365
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,770
我就是擔心  如果我不安排
I'm just worried that if I don't schedule

366
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,410
床上運動的時間表  我可能根本就不會想起
our bedroom endeavors, then I may not think about them,

367
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,160
你就會變得冷漠疏遠
and you'll grow cold and distant

368
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,680
到肌肉發達的碼頭工人懷里尋找慰藉
and seek solace in the arms of a heavily-muscled longshoreman.

369
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,930
我上哪兒去找碼頭工人
Where would I find a longshoreman?

370
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,220
碼頭啊  寫得明明白白了
Along the shore. It's in the name.

371
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,110
謝爾頓  除了你  我無法跟其他男人相好
Sheldon, I could never be with anybody but you.

372
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,950
那我就安心了
That's good to know.

373
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,090
我可不想跟一個
I wouldn't want to fight a man

374
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,900
敢摸魚的勇士打架
who's brave enough to touch a fish.

375
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,270
我們互相退一步好不好
How's this for a compromise?

376
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,050
隨你安排時間表  別告訴我就行
Make all the schedules you want, just don't tell me about them.

377
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,470
太棒了
Excellent.

378
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,480
我會自己編寫一個能自動生成
I'll create an algorithm that'll generate

379
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,200
偽隨機時間表的算法  你知道
a pseudo-random schedule. Yeah, and do you know why

380
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,190
為什么不是真隨機時間表嗎
it won't be a true random schedule?

381
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,160
因為生成真隨機數字
Because the generation of true random numbers

382
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,030
在電腦科學領域仍是未解難題
remains an unsolved problem in computer science.

383
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,040
跟我來
Come with me.

384
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,540
-我們要去哪兒  -酒店房間
- Where are we going? - To the hotel room.

385
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,720
等我們到了  我要你再說一遍  
And when we get there, I'm gonna need you

386
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,710
但你得脫光說
to say that again, except naked. ‭

387
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,060
本座庫博士
Go for Dr. K.

388
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,360
你是拉杰什·庫薩帕里嗎

尼爾·德格拉斯·泰森
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

391
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,180
哎喲媽呀
Uh, w-wow.

392
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,190
推特上這樣玩挺有意思的吧
How fun is this Twitter thing, huh?

393
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,830
你覺得自己很好笑嗎
You think you're funny?

394
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,690
我沒有《宋飛正傳》那么好笑
I'm-I'm not Seinfeld funny,

395
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,890
但我做過一次開放麥脫口秀
but I did an open mic night once.

396
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,890
{\an8}在酒吧舉行的民間脫口秀
任何人都可以上臺表演

397
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,910
你難笑到死
You're not funny.

398
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,050
笑笑屋酒吧的人就是這么說的
Yeah, that's what they said at the Chuckle Hut.

399
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,270
這樣好不好
How about this:

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,440
我下周在帕薩迪納的佛羅曼酒吧舉辦簽書會
I've got a book signing at Vroman's in Pasadena next week.

401

你來當我的面  說你在網上說的那些話怎么樣
Why don't you come by and say some of those things to my face.

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,310
不了不了
Oh, no,

403
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,900
不過謝謝邀請
but thanks for the invite.

404
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,290
算你機靈  下次你拿起電話時
Smart move, and the next time you pick up your phone,

405
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,090
記住  老子就是把冥王星踢出太陽系的人
remember, I'm the guy who kicked Pluto out of the solar system.
