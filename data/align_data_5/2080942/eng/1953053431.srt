1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:03,132
For those of you who are too
fucking busy,

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:05,134
here's what happened last week
on <i>Shameless...</i>

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,103
Karen, when do you want me
to come back in?!

4
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:09,039
Never!
That girl that you're with,

5
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:11,173
<i>you'll knock her up.</i>
<i>You'll get a job at Best Buy.</i>

6
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,207
And from that point on,
you won't be able

7
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:14,608
to hold the job very long
because you'll know the truth,

8
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:16,376
that you never lived
up to your potential.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,344
I'm gonna give the baby up
for adoption.

10
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,546
How mucho we get for the baby?

11
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,881
I introduce you to a pool
of parents that want to adopt.

12
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:24,982
So you're a broker?
I'm gay!

13
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:26,850
You're the one that's pretending
to date Mandy

14
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:27,851
<i>so you can fuck her brother.</i>

15
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:29,086
Not doing this.
Doing what?

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,020
Figure out that chick
who's sitting on my sofa

17
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,422
wearing your wedding ring,
and then we'll talk.

18
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:34,856
Just don't give up on me.

19
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,723
You doing anything
this afternoon?

20
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:36,724
We need a coach.

21
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,692
Fiona go to the games?

22
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:38,694
Never misses one.

23
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:39,361
Call me "Coach."

24
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:41,230
Who's your friend?

25
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:42,598
Heard you can help me.

26
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,168
Need an alibi.
How much?

27
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:45,170
$1,500.

28
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,071
What are you doing?

29
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:48,240
Sending cash to my sons.

30
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,778
That will make Frank
very happy.

31
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:53,113
Frank gets none.

32
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:54,749
You and Monica are over, Frank.

33
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,351
Me and Monica are
getting married.

34
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:58,953
She's still married to me!

35
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:01,623
I have never, ever had
any intention of getting back

36
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:02,757
together with you, Frank.

37
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,258
Expelled?
You win.

38
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,727
School or leave!
What are you doing?

39
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,563
I'm not going back to school,
so I guess it means I'm leaving.

40
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:10,797
Good-bye, Sheila.

41
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:12,065
Good-bye, Peg.

42
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:17,269
Frank, your mother's passed.

43
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,805
Mom died!

44
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:22,743
Lip, come back!

Okay. Well, well, how much is
that gonna cost?

76
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,253
I-I have to call you back
with an answer.

77
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,055
Thank you.

78
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,891
Grammy died?

79
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,927
Honey, I am so sorry.

80
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:53,697
She was my mother.
I'm the one who's hurting here.

81
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,899
That was the Cook County
Hospital Morgue.

82
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,402
You need to claim her body
or they're gonna cremate her.

83
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,638
I am done running around
trying to please that woman.

84
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:02,706
Grammy died?

85
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,609
Debbie! Oh, Liam,

86
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,946
look at you,
my little Brown Bear.

87
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,449
Look how big you are!

88
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:12,650
How long is she staying?

89
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,752
Only forever and a day.

90
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,154
My camo pants still
in the dryer?

91
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,289
Ian! It's Ian.

92
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,659
Hell is she doing here?

93
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,161
I asked your mother
to come home.

94
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,763
Oh, wait,
you live here now, too?

95
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,598
I made breakfast.
Yeah, no, thanks.

96
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,234
Your mom spent a lot of time
making that breakfast!

97
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,069
Sit down, eat it!
This is bullshit.

98
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,270
Ian, wait.

99
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm gonna wash
his mouth out with soap.

100
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,009
You can wash mine out.
I wanna fart bubbles.

101
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,477
Carlie!

102
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,312
Mom?

103
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,814
You're so big!

104
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,682
Come on, baby.
I made you breakfast.

105
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:46,484
Sit do and eat.

106
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,953
Where's Lip?

107
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:57,194
My mom showed up today.
She just came out of nowhere.

108
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,797
She staying?
Never does.

109
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,299
Lip playing hooky today?

110
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,635
He, uh, dropped out of school.

111
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,303
So Fiona gave him the boot.

112
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,671
I think he's
staying with Karen.

113
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,040
You know, you kill it

114
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,910
in one spot,
pops up in another.

115
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:16,313
You okay?

116
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,316
Yeah.

117
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,818
How's, uh, Mickey holding
up in juvie?

118
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,955
Called me a fuck-twat,
so he seems okay.

119
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,823
You should visit him.

120
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,959
Yeah, he's a little
pissed at me for something.

121
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,360
Thinks I pussied out.

122
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,729
Did you?
Kinda.

123
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:36,201
You're lucky your mom's dd.
Yeah.

124
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:41,372
So weird to have someone here,
and then they're just... gone.

125
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,209
I know.
What happens to their soul?

126
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,512
Maybe it's like what
happened to Karen in utero.

127
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:51,082
She was a twin, and then she
just absorbed the other one.

128
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,385
Whoa. You mean, like, maybe
Peggy's soul got absorbed by us?

129
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,154
Maybe.

130
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,658
Rats!

131
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,995
It says in order
to have a hospice license,

132
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,530
I have to get a nursing degree.

133
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,700
University of River Phoenix.

134
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,069
It's all online.
Seen the ads on TV.

135
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,403
Huh.

136
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,076
Hey! Hi!

137
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:17,778
Karen...

138
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,382
I know it's your choice,
but I just want

139
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,718
to go on record
as saying I think

140
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:25,286
you should consider
keeping the baby.

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,721
And Jody.

142
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:29,123
No offense, Lip.
None taken.

143
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,558
Since Frank bailed, can
I dump his Speed Stick

144
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:33,193
and English Leather
and put my stuff

145
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,429
back in the medicine cabinet?

146
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,065
Oh, sweetheart, you know,
both of you come sit down.

147
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,370
Sweetie...

148
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:46,908
ur grandmother's passing
has taken

149
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,410
quite a toll on Frank.

150
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,879
He just needs some time alone.

151
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,782
Mom, he packed
a duffle bag and left.

152
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,551
Sometimes when people

153
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,986
love each other very much,
they need time apart,

154
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,555
so when they come
back together,

155
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,225
their love is even stronger.

156
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay, Mom.

157
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,995
Thanks for the talk,
Mrs. Jackson.

158
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,263
Sure.

159
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,302
Karen...

160
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:15,673
is Lip gonna stay overnight
again tonight?

161
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:18,309
I told you, he's just a friend.
Needs a place to stay.

162
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:21,145
Lip is very nice,

163
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:24,148
but I hope you see
what a catch Jody is.

164
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,115
Jody's an idiot.

165
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,651
Give it time.

166
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:31,155
"Then the window draws
full upon your mind.

167
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,928
There, beyond the sway
of curtains, men walk."

168
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:39,664
Maya Angelou said that.

169
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:43,634
I'm pretty sure she wasn't
talking about Jody,

170
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,536
but thanks, Mom.

171
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,474
Okay.

172
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,655
Are you really gonna do this
every morning?

173
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:05,389
Do what?

174
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:07,024
Show up, try to woo me?

175
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:08,459
I'm looking for Lip.

176
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,360
Uh-huh. What, I can't be
friends with your brother?

177
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:11,895
No, you can't.

178
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,230
Are we gonna have a funeral?
No.

179
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,698
Who died?

180
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:16,133
Grammy.

181
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,136
Wow. I'm sorry, guys.

182
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,005
A funeral requires a body,

183
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,840
and your father hasn't picked
her up yet.

184
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,009
So she's just laying somewhere
all alone?

185
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,912
Uh, we could have a memorial.
I mean, you don't need a body for that.

186
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,915
I spy doughnuts!

187
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,684
Hey, check it out, Steve.
It's a bloody butthole.

188
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,387
Awesome, dude!

189
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:36,822
School. Let's go.

190
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,090
Lunch?

191
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:39,658
Shit!

192
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,160
We already had that
for breakfast.

193
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:42,695
You know, sometimes

194
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,764
astronauts would have breakfast.

195
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:46,232
Lip never came back
after he blew out of here.

196
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,200
Check at Karen's.

197
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,234
Karen's?
Isn't she married?

198
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:49,035
Aren't you?

199
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:50,403
Technicality.

200
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,905
Good-bye.

201
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,574
Oh, such sweet sorrow.

202
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,008
You gonna drive us?

203
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,376
Absolutely.
No, he's not.

204
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,579
I mean it, Steve.
Stop coming around.

205
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,183
Who was that?

206
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:05,920
Are you still gonna be here when
we get home from school?

207
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,088
Absolutely.

208
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,522
I told you so.

209
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:10,424
Shut up!
You didn't believe her either.

210
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,026
You know what I think?

211
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,796
I think we should paint
your room a new color today.

212
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,130
Here. Go now!

213
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,234
Have fun at school!

214
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,436
Hey...

215
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:23,771
I got this.

216
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,053
So, where is Lip?
Really? That's what

217
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,088
you want to ask me?
Should've known.

218
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,157
He's always been your favorite.

219
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,927
That is not true, Fiona.
Oh, that's right.

220
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,663
You're your favorite.

221
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,433
So, uh...

222
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,769
Bob throw you out, or you
walk out on her, too?

223
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,938
Your father came to me.
He needed me.

224
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:56,172
Told me you needed me, too.

225
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,874
He lied. We don't.

226
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,176
I'm sorry. I'm here now.

227
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,744
I want to try and start over.

228
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,880
Will you let me?

229
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,623
Lip dropped out of school.

230
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:16,926
I told him, back in school
or he couldn't live here.

231
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,194
You threw him out?

232
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,462
He left.

233
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,130
He's family, Fiona.

234
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,798
Lip chose to leave this family.

235
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,767
That sound familiar?

236
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:29,371
Look at my two girls,

237
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:30,840
together in the kitchen.

238
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,441
I don't know which one
of you is prettier.

239
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,377
I don't have time for this.

240
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,446
I got to get Liam dressed.
Where you taking him?

241
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,982
He comes to work with me.
No, that's silly. Leave him home.

242
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,383
His mother.

243
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,885
Come on, let me prove to you

244
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,953
that I can take care
of him, please.

245
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,456
You're gonna be me all day?

246
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,857
Absolutely.

247
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,325
You're not going to ave
with him?

248
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,560
Run off and join the circus

249
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,961
or some crazy shit like that?

250
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:55,031
I just want to take care
of my baby, Fiona.

251
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:01,471
Thank you.

252
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,040
Ooh, we're going to have so much
fun, my little Brown Bear.

253
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,708
Uh, milk and water
from the sippy cup.

254
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,180
Got it. And he's got to drink
it from a big boy cup.

255
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:12,414
I'm going to drink a beer

256
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,049
from a big boy cup.

257
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,184
Want to watch?

258
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,521
Yeah.

259
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,991
You know, I saw
Choady sneaking out

260
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,594
when we came in.
My mom lets him in

261
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,996
when I'm not home.

262
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,898
It's like having
a wet Labrador.

263
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:29,533
Fucking clueless.

264
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:35,107
So... how long are you
planning on staying?

265
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,241
What, you mean here?

266
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,509
Mom wants to know.

267
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:40,379
Says I have to charge you rent.

268
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:42,048
Your mom wants me to pay rent?

269
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,849
Well, how much?

270
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,384
$100 a week.

271
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:48,054
What aunt dead daddy's
insurance money?

272
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,022
My check's tied up at
the claims department.

273
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,857
I could stay in the basement.

274
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,626
Could knock $20 off, but...

275
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,395
still going have to charge you.

276
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,464
Fuck you, Karen.

277
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:01,434
Isn't that how we got
into this mess?

278
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:03,604
You know what?
And fuck me going on any more

279
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:05,239
of the adoption interviews.
You know, good luck

280
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,107
signing off on an
adoption without

281
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:08,475
the biological father's
signature.

282
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,110
I'll get Frank to go with me.

283
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,746
Might not even have
to cut him in.

284
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,151
♪ Till you walked out the door ♪

285
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,556
♪ And I've seen
that face before ♪

286
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,592
♪ Now I'll always
wonder why... ♪

287
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,327
I'm always pleasantly surprised

288
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:28,062
we don't find dead hookers
cut up in the toilets.

289
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,463
There's still time.

290
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,465
Where's Liam?

291
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:33,467
Monica dumped Bob
and showed up on our doorstep

292
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,268
to play house.

293
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,937
She insisted on
watching Liam today.

294
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,505
He's probably got his tongue
in an outlet by now.

295
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,541
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
First thing she did

296
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:42,810
was bu my balls
for kicking Lip out.

297
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:44,578
You didn't kick him out.

298
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:47,148
Feel like I might have,
giving him an ultimatum.

299
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,917
I miss him.

300
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,418
Especially with Monica home.

301
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,421
Lip usually has my back
in that fight.

302
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,790
See, this is the kind of shit
I'm afraid of happening

303
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,525
if Kev and I have a kid or two.

304
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,294
Little fuckers gang up on you.

305
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,196
I've seen this movie before.

306
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,598
Monica comes home long enough
to reunite with Frank,

307
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,533
gets knocked up
with another kid, then splits.

308
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,335
Not this time.

309
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,504
Not gonna let her ruin Debbie
and Carl's lives, too.

310
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,675
Trash can's a foot away, people.

311
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,545
Why you got to be
such nasty pigs?

312
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,146
Human nature.

313
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:19,116
Given the choice, people
usually do the wrong thing.

314
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,120
Can't take it anymore.

315
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:25,356
I'm going to run home,
check on Liam

316
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,691
before we hit the ground floor.

317
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:27,825
Not a lot of trust in Monica.

318
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,193
Might be nice to have some time

319
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,962
for an actual life
while she's around.

320
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,931
Ain't you just the queen
of silver linings?

321
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,368
Live a little while you can.

322
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,403
Ugh.

323
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,007
What?

324
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,142
Hey, where'd you disappear to?

325
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:45,409
I didn't know I had to report

326
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,078
to you,
but if you must know, school.

327
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:49,346
Right. Look.

328
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,181
I'm sorry about that shit
that happened earlier.

329
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,350
Give me the rest of the day
to find a new place to stay?

330
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,584
Fine.

331
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,853
And, um...

332
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,355
I want to go on the rest

333
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,158
of the adoption meetings
with you, all right?

334
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:03,760
You know,
I-I'd kind of like to have

335
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:05,595
a say in where this kid
might end up.

336
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,698
Well, go if you
fucking want to go,

337
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:11,235
but I don't need help
or handouts from anyone.

338
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,542
Hey, Ron.

339
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:18,877
I need to talk to you.

340
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,412
What the hell
are you doing here?

341
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,047
My wife's inside.

342
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:24,617
Thing is, I'm kind of pregnant,
and it's yours.

343
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:27,020
What? I want to get an abortion,
but I can't afford it,

344
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:30,123
and I can't apply for a
credit card 'cause I'm not 18.

345
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,159
Hang on.

346
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,605
We had fun, though, didn't we?

347
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:50,377
Sometimes, when I see
the word "hospice"

348
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:53,280
on the screen, I pronounce it

349
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,048
"ho spice" in my head.

350
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,483
Isn't that silly?

351
00:14:56,518 --> 00:15:00,153
Sometimes I do that
with "butt... ermilk."

352
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,625
But... "ermilk's"
not really a word.

353
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:07,461
Did you just hear
what you just said?

354
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,131
You said, "Buttermilk's
not really a word."

355
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,601
Oh. I did.

356
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,974
Did you hear that?

357
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:22,076
Been hearing a lot of
weird noises the last few days.

358
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,777
So have I.

359
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,846
Don't think I'm crazy,

360
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,915
but sometimes I think

361
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:29,583
Eddie's spirit is
still in this house.

362
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:39,225
Eddie?

363
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:42,996
Eddie?

364
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,774
Mom had a huge chunk of cash

365
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,809
lying around
before she kicked it.

366
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,544
Aah!
How much?

367
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,479
75 large. Oh, God!

368
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:01,614
I think it's at Sheila's.
Get it.

369
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:03,149
Hmm? Get it, and give it to me.

370
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:05,318
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah. Give it to me.

371
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:07,987
Oh! Jesus Christ!

372
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,156
Really? In the kitchen?

373
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,658
I thought you were
working, honey.

374
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,527
- Where's Liam?
- He's sleeping!

375
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,829
And I will remind you
this is our house

376
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:20,132
and we can make love
in any room we want to.

377
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,867
Your kids eat off that table!

378
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:24,337
Let's fuck in her room next.

379
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,544
Give it to me! Give it to me!

385
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:52,198

387
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,168
Hey, I'll see you after work.
All right.

388
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,571
Bitch Karen's trying

389
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,606

Can you believe that shit?

390
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,241
Hey, you want
to play a quick game

391
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:03,675

392
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,377
What, you got it?
Hell, yeah, I got it.

393
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:06,845
I waited in line.

394
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,079
Hey, um...

395
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:09,547
cool if I stay at your place

396
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,881

Shit, yeah.

00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,785

398
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,653
Kitchen.

399
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,961
Lip is not staying with us.

400
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,563
We are not getting in the middle
of this Gallagher shit storm.

401
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,265
You guys are taking
Fiona's side on this?

402
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,534
Fiona will have our asses
for harboring her fugitive.

403
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,902
What if we adopt Lip

404
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,804
as our own?

405
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,573
Wouldn't that change everything?

406
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,445
Damn. Calm down.
Go home Lip.

407
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,915
I'm sorry, dude.
You can't stay here.

408
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,285
Well, what the fuck, man?

409
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,759
Yeah, well, thanks
for all your help, Kev.

410
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:01,064
Your taxes done or your
liquor commission test taken

411
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,600
or you get your tongue stuck
to a frozen pole, all right?

412
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,976
I like to wash her
late in the day.

413
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,078
In the sun,
the water can dry too fast

414
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:16,412
and leave spots.

415
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:17,813
Good to know.

416
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,849
She send you?

417
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:22,651
No. She doesn't
know I'm here.

418
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,353
She needs you, Bob.

419
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,290
You're the best thing that
ever happened to her.

420
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,760
I don't want shit to do
with that bitch anymore.

421
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,662
Especially now that
her snatch is on

422
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,298
that nasty old
Irish cock of Frank's.

423
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:38,666
Pass.

424
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,568
You don't love her?

425
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,605
Love ain't got nothing
to do with it.

426
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,210
Living with Monica was like
living with a black hole.

427
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,313
Drained my spirit
and my bank account.

428
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,814
Bitch spent all my money

429
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,851
on meditation retreats

430
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,185
and unfinished,
half-assed

431
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,121
home renovations!

432
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:01,824
Thank the good Lord
Frank showed up when he did.

433
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,894
Frank came looking for her?

434
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:08,899
Crying like a little bitch
about his dead mama.

435
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,768
Shit, they're pathetic--
both of them!

436
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,972
Monica's your problem now.

437
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:20,844
Presenting His and Her Lordship,
Frank and Monica Gallagher!

438
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,414
Holy shit.

00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,050
About time.

440
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,685
You still got an open
tab running, bitch.

441
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,321
Kate! How are you, baby?

442
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:33,323
Better without
your bad influence.

443
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:35,225
Oh, please, give me a break.

444
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,493
Hey, Monica.

445
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,695
Hi, Gus! Wow.

446
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,330

Yeah, yeah.

00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,332
Good one, huh?
Oh, Kev!

448
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,567
You remembered.

449
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,568
Irish Car Bomb.
How could I forget?

450
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,570
I'll have one of
those, too, K-Ball.

451
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,938
You can't handle
an Irishar Bomb.

452
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,840
You look good, Moni.
You back on your meds?

453

Ah, hell, no.

454
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,611
That crap makes me all foggy

455
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:55,879
and gets me fat.

456
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:59,416
Besides, I am not bipolar.

457
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,754

536
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:01,701
Mom hid the money
in here somewhere.

537
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:06,674
Be vewy quiet.

538
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,209
I'm hunting wabbits.

539
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:19,687
Just the house... settling.

540
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:22,624
Wind. It's...

541
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:25,226
the wind settling the house.

542
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,798
Shh! Shh!

543
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:31,633
Karen?

544
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,237
Smells like Bengay in here.

545
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:40,977
Karen?

546
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,548
Look inside the cushions.

547
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,151
Mom was always
a big cushion hider.

548
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,319
Okay.

549
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,069
Nope.

550
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,912
Go. What?

551
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:20,016
No! No, no, no!

552
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,783
Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,886
Eddie?

554
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,156
Is that you?

555
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:35,932
I don't know
exactly what it is...

556
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,734
that you want...

557
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:42,438
But I'm... I'm here

558
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,807
to talk.

559
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:50,278
Can you talk, Eddie?

560
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:55,216
Well, that's
a silly question, isn't?

561
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,718
'Cause, if you couldn't,

562
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,554
you wouldn't be able
to tell me.

563
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:14,434
Huh?!

564
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,604
Hey, Professor,
you got a minute?

565
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,106
Got a classroom
full of freshmen

566
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,607
staring at a Smart Board.

567
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,676
Just wondering if you,
uh, had any work for me.

568
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,344
Work after school?

569
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:26,312
Uh, no, I, uh...
I-I dropped out.

570
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,747
I got a baby on the way.

571
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,615
Was wondering if you
could hook me up

572
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,484
as a TA or something.

573
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:34,353
You can't do shit
without a diploma.

574
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:35,955
Well, tell them I'm an
idiot savant or something.

575
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:37,189
I'll tell them you're an idiot.

576
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:38,457
When don't you call me when you

577
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:40,626
graduate with a 4.5 GPA?

578
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,631
Wow, so, uh,
under the liberal beard

579
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,634
lives an uptight
bourgeois prick.

580
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:49,437
You think I like
being a soothsayer

581
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:52,006
and watching you live out
your <i>Jerry Springer</i> fate?

582
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,341
Congratulations--
you're a high school dropout

583
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,310
with a pregnant girlfriend.

584
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,878
And the only thing
that's missing for you

585
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,680
is a job at Mickey D's.

586
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:00,149
And if you work really hard,
you might

587
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,450
get your picture
with the dead eyes

588
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:02,818
in the employee of
the month frame

589
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:04,053
over the cash register.

590
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:05,321
Huh?

591
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:06,622
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

592
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:08,491
Go back to school.

593
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,346
Good boy.

594
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,515
Yum.

595
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,050
What's this?
There's no more room

596
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,685
in this world for
another Gallagher.

597
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,355
Birth control--
you either hop on

598
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,190
the Ortho bandwagon or leave.

599
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:39,026
It's okay to take it
with your shrink meds.

600
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,028
I checked.

601
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,402
That the same speech
you gave Lip?

602
00:27:47,436 --> 00:27:50,004
Same speech, different outcome.
Thanks.

603
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,239
No biggie. If they
haven't shut down

604
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:53,708
our Planned Parenthood yet,

605
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:54,942
we can make you an appointment

606
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,178
to get your own RX.
No.

607
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:58,680
Thanks for everything.

608
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:00,215
For taking care of my kids,

609
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,216
my house, my husband.

610
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,420
We all did it.

611
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:06,755
No.

612
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,457
You did it, Fi.

613
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:10,593
And I know
what a huge sacrifice

614
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,028
it must have been.

615
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:15,031
And I can probably never
make it up to you,

616
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,767
but I want to try.

617
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:20,537
Thanks.

618
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:23,039
So the whole...

619
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:26,109
Bob thing
was just a phase or what?

620
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,158
You sure you're not
going to need these?

621
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:43,160
Mmm. Not lately, but who knows?

622
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:45,062
What about the guy
who came by yesterday?

623
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:46,430
Steve.

624
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,065
I remember him.

625
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,733
He's cute.

626
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,568
I would totally hit that.

627
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:53,137
Ew. Mom!

628
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:55,306
No, I'm not gonna.
Better not.

629
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,007
I'm already up against
a hot Brazilian.

630
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,275
He's got a girlfriend?

631
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,510
Wife.

632
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:00,778
Fiona!

633
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:02,313
Oh, you're going to judge me?

634
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,919
So... how we gonna
get rid of her?

635
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,522
Yeah.

636
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:14,126
She's gone!

637
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,895
She's gone!

638
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,772
Oh, this is nice.

639
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,273
Estefania's dad.

640
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,141
Huh. Now, you
realize you guys

641
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:30,642
basically have
the same name, right?

642
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:33,711
Look, I can get you

643
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,480
back in my sister's lap if you
let me stay here for a bit.

644
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:37,715
How long you need to stay?

645
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,517
Just till I'm back on my feet.

646
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,819
Well, always saw myself
living with a Gallagher.

647
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:43,955
Just always thought
it would be Fiona.

648
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,791
Listen, you put me up for a bit,
it'll piss her off so much

649
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,527
she'll be back at your doorstep
in a heartbeat.

650
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:52,998
Listen--
maybe, in exchange

651
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:54,734
for staying here,
you can help me out.

652
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,469
Putting together
a pretty big deal.

653
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,671
I-I don't know.

654
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,873
Last time I helped you out
with a deal,

655
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,908
I ended handcuffed to a bench.

656
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:05,044
You know how to hack
a voice mail?

657
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:06,212
Probably. For
the right price.

658
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:09,915
Hi. Oh.

659
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:11,149
Right. Remember me?

660
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,917
Uh, Lip.

661
00:30:12,952 --> 00:30:14,218
Oh, that's...

662
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:16,187
There's a robe in the bathroom.

663
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:18,423
You can use the robe.

664
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:19,991
<i>El robio.</i>
Jesus.

665
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,359
<i>R-Robio.</i>
Oh, bye-bye.

666
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,227
Okay.

667
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,764
Shit, man, I got
to be somewhere.

668
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:27,165
You got a key?

669
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,500
Uh, I'll leave one for you

670
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,502
at the front
desk. Here.

671
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,538
I'll, uh, do my best,
Mr. Murdoch.

672
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,409
Hearing from you was a
wonderful surprise. Oh.

673
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,011
I thought we'd
lost you for good.

674
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,448
Well, my recently-deceased
husband was born again.

675
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,448
Mm-hmm.

676
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:44,117
So we went to that church

677
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:46,252
with all the guitars
and the minister

678
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:47,353
with the Hawaiian shirt.

679
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,892
Well, I'm just so glad
that you accepted my invitation.

680
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,628
Actually, there was a favor
I wanted to ask.

681
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:55,629
Mm-hmm.

682
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,744
Someone else home?

683
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,746
No.

684
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:18,118
Do you believe in
evil spirits, Father?

685
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:20,453
I believe people can

686
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:25,158
become harassed by evil spirits
as a result of evil actions.

687
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:27,327
Hmm.
Until they repent,

688
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,096
those spirits linger.

689
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:42,075
Well, any idea how one might
cast them out of one's house

690
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,678
before one opens
a hospice business?

691
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:49,983
Well, in Matthew
5:22, Jesus says

692
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:51,918
that we need to repent...
Mm-hmm.

693
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:55,655
Forgive and love.

694
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,658
Is there someone
you need to forgive?

695
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:03,028
Anything you need to repent?

696
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:06,931
Relax.

697
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:10,868
Go into the light!

698
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:12,803
Nothing comes to mind.

699
00:32:12,837 --> 00:32:15,505
But I'll pray on it.

700
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:21,045
Jody! My man!

701
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,713
Hey, Frank.

702
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,114
You just missed lunch.

703
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,716
Just getting something
from the Kash and Grab.

704
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,384
Headed there myself.

705
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,021
Really sorry
about your mom, man.

706
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:31,822
Must be tough.
It is.

707
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:34,058
There's so much I still
want to say to her.

708
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:35,693
So many questions.

709
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:37,161
She loved you, Frank.

710
00:32:37,195 --> 00:32:38,728
Just didn't know how to say it.

711
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:40,397
Yes. I know that now.

712
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,500
Also know she was sitting on
a pretty big pile of money.

713
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:45,535
Wanted me to act as an
executor of her will.

714
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,037
Any idea where
she kept the cash?

715
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:48,238
In the cushions.

716
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:50,240
I knew it.

717
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:51,841
But then she divided it up.

718
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,476
Gave Sheila a grand
to say thanks

719
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,145
and had me mail the rest.

720
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,747
What? Mail it?

721
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:59,181
Where? To who?

722
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:00,984
Whom.
What?

723
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,051
To whom.

724
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:03,218
To whom the fuck

725
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:04,987
did she mail the
fucking money?!

726
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:06,722
They were all Gallagher names.

727
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:08,057
It was, uh, Wyatt,
Clayton, I think.

728
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,692
My fucking brothers?!

729
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,761
Where were they at the bitter
end?! Holding her hand?!

730
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:14,430
No, that was--
That bitch!

731
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,065
Shit!

732
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,066
Talk to you later.

733
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,334
Fuck!

734
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,769
Goddamn it!

735
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:22,839
Oh, shit.

736
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,541
Carl, I might've
shrunk your jersey.

737
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,409
Oh, hi.

738
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,777
I thought you were Carl.

739
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:28,946
Mom?

740
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,781
This is Little Hank.

741
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:31,916
That's your mom?

742
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,917
Hey, handsome.

743
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:34,787
Made some cookies.

744
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,091
Did you pick up
Grammy's body yet?

745
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,526
No, not yet, honey.

746
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,026
It's expensive.

747
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,896
I have some money.
No.

748
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,064
Look at you.

749
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:49,867
Like living with
a slutty Doris Day.

750
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:53,604
Did you have any luck
finding it?

751
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,705
Nope.

752
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,440
No? Not even in her
box of horrors.

753
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,608
Mom sent it to my brothers

754
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,712
Deb, I made you
a matching cheer outfit!

755
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,247
It's up on your bed.

756
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:04,815
Grammy's body?

757
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,917
Not too cute in a cheer outfit.

758
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,085
Where is she?

759
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,286
They've got her on ice, honey.

760
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,287
There's no rush.

761
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:12,123
Heard a girl's mom's

762
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:13,925
the best way to tell how
a girl's gonna look.

763
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,530
You're gonna be
a fucking fox, man.

764
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:22,768
Hey, sweetie.

765
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:24,237
I made some cookies.

766
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,671
Oh, so now we're, like, square

767
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,507
for you abandoning us
and everything.

768
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:28,942
Hey.

769
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:30,744
Are you coming with us
to Carl's game?

770
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,078
Yeah, I'm going to Carl's game.

771
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,513
I always go to Carl's games,

772
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,849
'cause I actually give a shit.

773
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:37,685
Ian Clayton Gallagher,
I told you,

774
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,454
do not talk to your
mother like that.

775
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,657
You haven't even claimed your
mom's body from the morgue

776
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,892
and you want to tell
me how to treat mine?

777
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,997
He's got a point.

778
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:52,966
Your dad told me about
the kid in the store.

779
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:57,271
You must be sad having someone
you care about in jail.

780
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,706
But you should never

781
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,174
feel ashamed about
what and who you are.

782
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:02,676
I'm not.

783
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,878
Well, when I was with
Roberta, I was proud.

784
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:07,180
No, it wasn't a
perfect relationship,

785
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:11,151
but we were never ashamed.

786
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:13,453
Maybe you should have been.

787
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:20,625
So how about, after Carl's
game, I take you out?

788
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,993
Cheer you up.

789
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:27,699
Maybe.

790
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,221
Less ogling, more hacking.

791
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,523
Jesus, I'm in the
voice mailbox.

792
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:55,258
I just need to figure out
how to copy the messages

793
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,561
without people being able to
tell they were ever listened to.

794
00:35:57,595 --> 00:35:59,563
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

795
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,097
Less you know, the better.

796
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:02,599
Now I'm off to lead a pack

797
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:04,768
of tiny, testosteroned animals
to victory.

798
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,203
Gonna warm 'em up and give 'em

799
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:07,572
my best <i>Fray Night Lights</i>
speech about

800
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:08,940
hearts and eyes or some shit.

801
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:10,108
I don't know.

802
00:36:10,142 --> 00:36:11,442
Where go?
Uh, the game.

803
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:12,744
Football.

804
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:13,946
I go.

805
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,281
Uh, Lip, you mind
bringing Este later?

806
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,582
What do you think?

807
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:18,783
Uh, Lip will bring you later.

808
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,685
You go <i>con</i> Lip.

809
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,786
Ah, yes!

810
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,621
I come on Lip.

811
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,089
With!

812
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,457
You come <i>with</i> Lip.

813
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:26,291

I'll take two.

824
00:37:40,798 --> 00:37:42,599
Your family's pretty cool, Red.

825
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,867
Hut!

826
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:46,937
Go, go, go!

827
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,684
Lip!

828
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:01,053
Lip! Come on,
honey, sit down.

829
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:03,188
Come on, sit with us!

830
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,490
What, I'm off the
boat for one minute

831
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,125
and there's a fucking mutiny?

832
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,827
Yeah, well no one told you
to get out of the boat.

833
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:10,061
Actually, you did.

834
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:11,629
Hey, Lip, don't
be mad at Fiona.

835
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,964
Come on.
Hey, Monica, shut up.

836
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,799
You know what,
like most of my life,

837
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,567
this has nothing to do with you.
I sit?

838
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,669
What? Yeah, sit.
Wherever's fine.

839
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:20,571
Oh, you babysitting now?
Roommate.

840
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,239
You're living at Steve's?

841
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,707
Yeah, no curfews,

842
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:25,409
no ultimatums,

843
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:27,378
no befriending the enemy
behind my back.

844
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:30,981
Come on. She just showed up.
What was I supposed to do?

845
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:32,549
Oh, really?

846
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:35,018
Oh, you're just gonna
storm off like a baby?!

847
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:37,154
Too bad there's no door
you can slam!

848
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:39,589
Your son's a real prick.

849
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,491
Hut!

850
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,961
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah!

851
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:48,231
Yes! All right, nice effort
out there, D'Shawn.

852
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:50,834
Just try throwing the ball to
someone on your own team next time.

853
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:52,268
Lip's living with you?

854
00:38:52,302 --> 00:38:54,537
He was sleeping on the El.
Kid had nowhere else to go.

855
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,776
They're ten. Have them
run the ball, for Christ's sake.

856
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,781
You're going out. You're going
out. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

857
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,119
So, my friend Flying Crow...
Yeah?

858
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:15,854
...said smudging is
a surefire way

859
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,590
to get rid of evil
spirits in a house.

860
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,994
Be gone, spirits.

861
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:31,801
In the name of
our Savior Jesus Christ,

862
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:36,372
we ask that you leave.

863
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,808
And you don't want
to piss him off,

864
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,976
so just go, okay?

865
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:57,389
I really am so sorry
about all of this with Karen.

866
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,157
Her throwing you out.

867
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:02,895
I-I feel so responsible
for her behavior.

868
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,896
Don't.

869
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,231
It's not your fault

870
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:07,932
she's going through
a hard time.

871
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,234
Yes, but even so,

872
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:11,501
you deserve better.

873
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:14,637
You're a good man, Jody.

874
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:19,909
We should pray on it.

875
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,444
Yeah.

876
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:53,341
Why don't you get
your own fries?

877
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:56,111
'Cause I want to eat yours.

878
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:58,146
So, I was minding
my own business,

879
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,848
listening in on
Estefania's phone call.

880
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:03,486
Turns out she's totally
in love with some other guy.

881
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,488
You know, she's playing Steve.

882
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:06,889
So?

883
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,825
So you think I should
tell him about it?

884
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,894
What's in it for you if you do?

885
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,728
It's not about me.

886
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,631
Exactly. If there's
no money involved,

887
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,133
don't get other people's
sh on your shoes.

888
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,969
So you're saying if I was rich,

889
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:20,904
then you'd consider
keeping the kid with me?

890
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,307
How rich? Because
if you were that rich,

891
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:25,309
there's no way you'd think
you still wanted this kid.

892
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:29,113
You might think you do now,
but in the long run?

893
00:41:30,515 --> 00:41:31,482
Hi.
Hi.

894
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:34,084
I'm Alana.
This is Jeff.

895
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,986
Sorry I got started
without you guys.

896
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,388
Have to keep
the little guy fed.

897
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,423
So, you're 17?

898
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,092
Oh, yeah, we both are.

899
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,360
So, what do you drive?

900
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:45,828
Your cars?
Um,

901
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:47,263
I drive

902
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,566
a Lexus and Alana's

903
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,101
got a Volvo.

904
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,235
Two cars.

905
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:53,536
You guys are flush.

906
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,944
Uh, is Lip here?

907
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,079
Oh, no.

908
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:04,414
Lip no home.

909
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,349
Nice surprise.
Throw him out.

910
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:09,586
What?
He needs to be in school.

911
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,856
I'm not his father,
and more importantly,

912
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,023
you're not his mother.
Yeah.

913
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,059
If I was, I would've
beaten him black and blue

914
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:17,961
with a wooden spoon.
You don't always have to be

915
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:18,962
responsible for everyone, Fiona.

916
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,263
Excuse me?

917
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:21,397
Monica's back.

918
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:23,766
Enjoy it.

919
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,601
Take the GED.

920
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:26,402
Read a book.

921
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:28,103
Fuck you.

922
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,271
Truth?

923
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,440
I took in the bear cub

924
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:33,142
looking to rile
the adult female.

925
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:35,445
Hoping she'd charge over here.

926
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,647
Dangerous.

927
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,282
She might rip your head off.

928
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,051
Hasn't yet.

929
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:42,151
Truth?

930
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:43,586
I'm here to see Estefania.

931
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,653
Really?

932
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,655
Hey,

933
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,224
Este, Fiona wants to
take you out tonight.

934
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:50,926
Huh?
Uh, drinking.

935
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:53,162
Dancing.

936
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,497
<i>Con</i> Fiona.
Ah!

937
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:58,834
You're such an asshole.

938
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,340
Enemies closer, right?

939
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:03,312
He can't stay here.

940
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,650
Promise me you'll kick him out.

941
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,321
Ah, Lip.

942
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,267
What the hell was that about?

943
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,335
You.

944
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,274
Me and Bob used to come here.

945
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:33,444
It's a great mix of gay, lesbian,
bi and some cool breeders.

946
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,380
It's, uh, a little weird

947
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:37,515
being ut" with you.

948
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,618
No shame, baby.

949
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:43,556
See? But don't even think
about coming out at school.

950
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,791
Somebody in that neighborhood
will knife you, for sure.

951
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,160
Think I'll get carded?

952
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,229
Nah. You're the bread
and butter here.

953
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:51,998
They need fresh meat to
keep the old guys coming in.

No, fucking Fiona.

to kick you out of the house.

988

enroll again in May.

I-I... how much

1001
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:06,836
would it cost to bury her?

1002
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,206
That much?

1003
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,709

Who is this?

1012
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:37,469
Uh, that is Steve's wife.

1013
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,004
Oh, the Brazilian!

1014
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:40,639
Hi!
We brought doughnuts

1015
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,341
and a bucket of chicken.
Oh!

1016
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:44,643

1017
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,412
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.

1018
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,652
This is not okay.

1019
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:55,387
Oh, come on.
Fi!

1020
00:46:55,422 --> 00:46:56,655

Hey! Debbie would like to
take this opportunity

1026
00:47:18,478 --> 00:47:22,414

about Grammy Gallagher.

1027
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:26,584
Well, I guess what
I'm gonna say is that

1028
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:29,121
Grammy will be missed.
