Um, I have some savings,
so I don't need to find

533
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,357
a job right away, but, uh,

534
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,403
I might take some time off,
maybe do some traveling.

535
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,579
With your supermarket boy?
How's that going, by the way?

536
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:32,885
Oh, uh, that didn't take.

537
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,364
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

538
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,192
You really get through them,
don't you?

539
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,717
I guess it looks like that.

540
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,110
Well, I guess
you're only young once.

541
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,987
I'm bipolar.

542
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,817
Really?

543
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,732
Yes.

544
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,647
I have been since I was 15.

545
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,345
How come you never told me?

546
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,739
[laughs] Come on,
who wants to hire someone

547
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,653
with a mental illness
in entertainment law?

548
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,003
Aren't we crazy enough?

549
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,744
[Lexi inhales sharply]

550
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,746
Sorry.

551
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,575
So why are you telling me now?

552
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:15,536
Because you're more than work.

553
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,407
And you should know
what you're dealing with

554
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,627
if we're gonna see each other
outside of the office.

555
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,150
Which I would like.

556
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,805
But I have incredibly
low periods.

557
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,896
So low that I can barely move.

558
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,290
I am impossible to be around.

559
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,379
I, uh, can barely answer
the phone.

560
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:34,903
I'm totally unreliable as a
friend... in fact, in some ways,

561
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,862
I'm probably the worst friend
you could ever have.

562
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,429
- Uh, I don't check a single box.
- [phone ringing]

563
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,869
I have a meeting
five minutes ago.

564
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,827
- Okay.
- Phyllis?

565
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,134
Hey. Those guys from admin
in my office,

566
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:50,136
tell them
we have to cancel today.

567
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,094
I'll see them tomorrow.

568
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:54,923
Yeah, I know,
tell them I'm really sorry.

569
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,888
You want to get lunch?

570
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,761
Mm-hmm.

571
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,851
Can we get a menu?

[Sylvia sighs]

573
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:16,379
So where are you right now,
mood-wise?

574
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,599
I'm coming off of a low.

575
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,732
Tonight I'll be pretty manic.

576
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:25,649
You're the first person
I've ever told about this.

577
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,217
How does it feel telling me?

578
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,225

I'm so glad you've told me.

583
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,587
- [sobbing]
- It explains so much.

584
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:52,546
- [gasping]
- If anything, not knowing

585
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,156
made it a little difficult

586
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,723
to connect with you fully,

587
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,246
the way I would have wanted.

588
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,166
So you want to get
a drink sometime?

589
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,994
[sniffles] You want to go
to the movies?

590
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,300
You want to see people?

591
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,084
All of the above.

592
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,742
You are the most fun
I've ever been around.

593
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,831
I'm not letting that go.

594
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:23,838
Thank you. Thank you.

595
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,448
Thank you.

[Lexi sobbing]

597
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:31,367
LEXI:
It's amazing what trusting

598
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,935
one true friend
in your life can do.

599
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,502
Once I told Sylvia,

600
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,591
it seemed like the cat
was out of the bag.

601
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,202
I rang old boyfriends
from over the years,

602
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,075
colleagues I had just stopped
calling for no reason.

603
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:44,990
I felt almost proud
of my condition.

604
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,905
It turns out I'm bipolar.

605
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,081
It was cathartic,
strangely healing,

606
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:52,562
how forgiving and understanding they were.

607
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:56,262
And how little credit
I had given so many people.

608
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:58,873
And I promised myself no person

609
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,920
would not know
the full story of me.

610
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,486
The good, the bad...

611
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,879
Oh, my gosh,
that's unbelievable.

612
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,098
And the mad.

613
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,621
How's she doing?

614
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,579
Jeff was a couple years ago.

615
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,146
Two long years since,

616
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,061
of searching for just
the right doctor

617
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:15,107
and just the right dose.

618
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,066
I know there's no cure for the
chemical imbalance in my brain,

619
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,677
any more than there's
a cure for love.

620
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:24,855
But there is a little
yellow pill I'm very fond of,

621
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,683
and a pale blue one,

622
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,250
and some pretty pink capsules,

623
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,165
and a handful of other colors

624
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,080
that have turned my life
around.

but... [chuckles]

into an alternate persona.

in the dating circle.

Obviously, seeing as how
you're reading this.

00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,790
I thought about Tinder,
but then I just settled

for the old-fashioned
Web dating service.
