We are not charging her extra.

她貌似没钱付的样子
She looks like she can't afford it.

如果有钱 她怎么会来这吃饭?
If she could, why would she be eating here?

81
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,969
我们不能以貌取人
Well, don't judge a book by its cover.

懂了吗 这就是我喜欢这个金发妞的原因

马上给你上樱桃派
Coming right back with that cherry pie.

105
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,827
如果哪天她忘记倾听了 我会提醒她的
I'll tell her if she ever stops listening.

106
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:14,464
我觉得Nola知道 我不只是个服务生
I think Nola knows I'm more than just a waitress.

107
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,499
她可以看透这制服后面真实的我
She can see right through this uniform.

108
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:19,769
我也行啊... 如果光线对头的话

117
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,556
我觉得Oleg在背着我偷吃
I think that Oleg is cheating on me.

118
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:41,924

他不是用来打长途电话或者...

他发音没有那么清楚
He is not that articulate.

136
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,511
哈! 这个老婊子!
Hah! That old whore!

00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,215
完全没听懂！
I have no idea!

139

我不会说俄语 但是...
I don't speak Russian, but...

他到底是什么毛病?
Tell me, what is his problem?

家里有我这个宇宙无敌美少女
He has a sweet, young filly like me at home

143
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,996
为什么还要去外面
and he needs to go out and plow

144
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:57,432
啃什么俄国老帮菜?
some old Russian field?

145
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,038
恩... 我本来想问问你们三个在这里干嘛
Well... I'd ask what you three are doing in here,

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,606
不过绝对不会比我
but it's never gonna top

147
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,376
幻想中你们三个会做的事精彩

148
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,417
真不敢相信Nola今晚竟然没来
I can't believe Nola didn't come in tonight.

149
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,253
简直跟我在星巴克的咖啡师一个样
This is exactly what happened with my Starbucks barista guy.

150
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:25,623
前一分钟 他还暧昧地冲我摆香蕉
One minute, he's suggestively arranging the bananas at me,

151
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,092
后一分钟 就一头倒地
and then next minute, he's face-down,

152
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,161
死在一滩豆奶里
dead in a puddle of soy milk.

153
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,363
Max 万一她出意外了呢?
Max, what if something happened to her?

154
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,432
那咱就不愁面包丁啦!
More croutons for us!

155
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,767
她说了"明天见"
She said, "I'll see you tomorrow."

156
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,097
那是空话 不过是一句场面话
That doesn't mean anything. It's just an expression

157
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:42,506
就像"员工必须洗手"
like, "Employees must wash hands."

158
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:47,144
或是... 或是"这娃是你生的"
Or... or, "The baby is yours."

159
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:49,346
嘿 各位亲!
Hey, everybody!

160
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,584
哦 Sophie 别大惊小怪的
Oh, Sophie, it's just you.

161
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,586
你个穷光蛋!
You're poor!

162
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,121
这下扯平了
And now we're even.

163
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,456
瞧 我又把它偷来了 Oleg在哪?
Look, I stole it again. Where's Oleg?

164
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,991
我来告诉你他不在哪...
I'll tell you where he's not...

165
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,960
烹饪学院
Culinary school.

166
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,160
他在休息
He's on break.

167
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,264
那女的会后悔的!
Oh, she's gonna be sorry!

168
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,968
哦... 没人敢夹在Sophie和她男人中间
Oh... no one comes between Sophie and her man.

169
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,171
除非是我们花钱请的
You know... unless we pay them to.

170
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,808
说几件事...
Couple things...

171
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,245
首先... 有人在认真工作吗?
A... does anyone ever work here?

172
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,348
Caroline 别操心了 "多放面包丁"姐没事
Caroline, stop worrying. Extra Croutons is fine.

173
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,684
她刚打来电话 交了个外卖
She just called to order some diner food to be delivered.

174
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:31,421
哦! 原来她想死在家里啊
Oh! So she wants to die at home.

175
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,657
我说过我们不送外卖的
I said we don't do deliveries.

176
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,659
我告诉她 你俩连把餐点
I told her you two can barely get the food

177
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,595
从窗口递到餐桌都做不到!
from the window to the tables!

178
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,168
Max 我必须跑一趟
Max, I had to stop by

179
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,170
给Nola送来沙拉和面包丁
and bring Nola her salad and croutons.

180
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,639
我是说 她现在也算是我的超级粉丝了
I mean, she's kind of my biggest fan right now.

181
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,609
确实... 因为你刚失去我这个
True... 'cause you just lost me.

182
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,845
我知道你觉得这太过了
I know you think this is crazy,

183
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,380
但Nola看待我的方式很特别
but there's something about the way Nola looks at me.

184
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,349
就好像看见了我的闪光点
It's like she's seeing something in me.

185
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:01,885
那女人戴着两副眼镜
The woman wears two pairs of glasses.

186
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:05,355
她眼里的你 不过是团啰嗦的黄毛球
To her, you're just a chatty yellow and orange blur.

187
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:08,692
有人说你的服务不尽人意(不外送)
I was told you didn't deliver.

188
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,895
是谁 她的前男友们?
By who, her old boyfriends?

189
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:14,731
你们俩打算杀了我还是怎样?
Are you two gonna kill me or something?

190
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,399
因为是的话
Because if you are,

191
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,402
我想先换顶帽子
I would like to put on a different hat.

192
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,171
不不不 她有点担心你
No, no, no. She got worried.

193
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,906
听着 你是她第一个常客
See, you're her first regular.

194
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,708
我只是过来凑热闹的
I'm just here for the story.

195
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,810
我原想这门后肯定藏着什么怪诞的东西
I figured there'd be something freaky behind this door

196
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:30,580
比如50英尺长的蟒蛇 还有快递员的残骸
like a 50-foot python and what's left of the UPS guy.

197
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:32,816
而Earl猜你是个男的
And Earl guessed you were a man.

198
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,417
没男的
No man.

199
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,221
就我和我的阴道 还有"艳照"
No, just me in here with my vagina and my photographs.

200
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,023
哦! 你还是个摄影师?
Oh! You're a photographer?

201
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,558
我喜欢摄影师!
I love photography!

202
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,293
而我喜欢隐私
And I love privacy.

203
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:44,861
我喜欢大麻
And I love pot.

204
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,297
哦 我还以为要轮番说一遍呢
Oh, I thought we were going around.

205
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,565
行了 你也进来吧
Come on. You better come in too.

206
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,168
你的嘴"阴"配她的嘴"痒"
You're the Yin to her Yap.

207
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,703
嘿 当心脚下
Hey, careful where you step.

208
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:56,372
我找不到我的第三副眼睛了
I can't find my third pair of glasses.

209
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,242
- 它就在你帽子上  - 没有 那是我的第四副
- It's on top of your hat.  - No, that's my fourth pair.

210
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,144
嘿!
Hey!

211
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,912
这是乞丐Billy!
This is Billy the bum!

212
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,581
他之前住在我楼角的一个箱子里
He used to live in a box around the corner from my apartment.

213
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,116
他还让我住了一晚
He even let me stay over once

214
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,851
好暂时摆脱我那烦人的室友
when I had to get away from this bad roommate.

215
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,554
- 哦 我前面那个?  - 不 说的就是你
- Oh, the one before me?  - No, it was you.

216
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:14,457
你们俩在一起真逗
You two are a riot together.

217
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,661
这让我不禁想起了我和我的摄影老友
You remind me of me and my old photographer friend

218
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:19,996
就是Annie Leibovitz
Annie Leibovitz.

219
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,464
当然 这是在...
Course, this was before...

220
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,032
在她成名前?
Before she got famous?

221
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,434
不是 是在她对我表白前
No. Before she hit on me.

222
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:28,170
我告诉她我不是弯的
I told her I wasn't into girls.

223
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,640
但... 她一定是被我的高帽搞糊涂了
But... I think she was confused by the derby.

224
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,477
是啊 我们都被它搞得有点糊涂
Yeah. I think we're all a little confused by it.

225
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,580
Nola 我想问问你有什么成就
Nola, I want to ask you if you've ever had any success,

226
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:40,182
但却不知如何不伤你的自尊心
but I don't know how to do that without insulting you.

227
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,952
你说得对 你不知道
That's correct. You don't.

228
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,657
哦! 你要在索和区办画展?
Oh! You're having a gallery show in SoHo?

229
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,392
再见
Good-bye.

230
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,228
呃 你们俩真是贴心
Uh, it was nice of you two

231
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,596
还特地过来看我
to, uh, come over, check on me.

232
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,932
呃... 有点怪但很贴心
Uh... weird, but nice.

233
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,501
或许我们能参加开幕仪式
Perhaps we could come to the opening.

234
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:01,870
哦 你没必要参加
Oh. Oh, you don't need to do that.

235
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:03,439
我知道我们没必要
I know we don't need to,

236
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,707
但我就想支持下你和你的佳作
but maybe I want to support you and your amazing work.

237
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,442
- 而且Max会享受那的免费酒品的  - 我会的
- And Max would enjoy the free wine.  - Yes, I would.

238
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,544
别
No.

239
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,379
哦 我会的
Oh, I would.

240
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,615
"别"是指"别到场"
No as in, "No, don't come."

241
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,217
现在 劳驾二位让开
Now, if you'll excuse me,

242
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,785
我要享用我的面包丁了
I wanna eat my croutons

243
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,021
并且免受两位的杂耍表演
without the vaudeville stylings

244
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,089
"烂到家"和"管闲事"
of Shecky and Nosy.

245
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:27,229
给你
Here.

246
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,165
哦 好极了 我还在找这个呢
Oh, yeah, good. I was looking for this.

247
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,183
真不敢相信你为了个常客
I can't believe you're doing all this

248
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,684
如此大费周章
for a diner regular.

249
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,719
我上次见你这么拼命还是这周一
I haven't seen you this desperate since Monday,

250
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:49,889
周二 周三 周四和周五呢
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

251
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,592
我知道... 一到周末 我就懒得管了
I know... on the weekends, I just give up.

252
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,894
快看那标题!
Look that title!

253
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,663
"伟大的底层人民"
"The Great Unwashed."

254
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,632
这有Oleg的蛋蛋吗?
Are Oleg's balls here?

255
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,337
Max 这是"艺术展"
Max, it's the "art scene."

256
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,140
有范点 至少要说睾丸
Class it up. At least say testicles.

257
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,775
晚上好 女士们
Evening, ladies.

258
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,776
Earl 你在这干什么?
Earl, what are you doing here?

259
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:15,047
还有 Han 你快钻进毛衣里去了
And, Han, your sweater's eating your head.

260
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,916
我是为了喝香槟而来的
I'm here for the champagne

261
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:21,320
还有就是我找不到出口了
and because I couldn't find my way out.

262
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,991
我刚才就撞上了一扇画着的门
I just walked into a picture of a door.

263
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:29,762
这里有些画都价值数千了!
Some of these are going for thousands of dollars!

264
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,831
Nola那贱富人 我打赌
That Nola bitch is rich, and I bet she has

265
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,801
她白拿的面包丁够盖个见鬼的度假屋了!
a frigging summer house made out of my free croutons!

266
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:40,239
Han 这是艺术现场 有范点
Han, it's the art scene. Class it up.

267
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,476
至少要说"该死的" 还有"睾丸"
At least say "freaking." Also, "testicles."

268
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,513
为了你俩浪费这全新的高领毛衣真不值
Well, I'm not wasting this new turtleneck on you two.

269
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:49,148
我要去四处转转
I'm going to go mingle.

270
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,617
一位高端时尚嫩模刚对我抛媚眼呢
A high fashion model was giving me the eye.

271
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,986
那她一定是喝高了
Then she'd have to be high.

272
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:58,023
呃 Han 那我得留下了
Uh, Han, I believe I'll stay here.

273
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,292
有谁比一个忍者神龟
Nobody wins with a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

274
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,327
更会僚机呢
as a wingman.

275
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,431
哦 嘿 各位亲
Oh, hey, everybody.

276
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,932
嘿 Sophie和Oleg
Hey, Sophie. Hey, Oleg.

277
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:10,068
我现在可以拿下"范"了吗?
So can I class it back down now?

278
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,504
抱歉迟到了 我刚刚在那边
Sorry we're late. I was just over there

279
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:16,208
羡慕那张"桥底的恩爱夫妻"的照片
admiring the photo of the happy couple under the bridge.

280
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,644
恩爱夫妻? Sophie 他们是对瘾君子
Happy couple? Sophie, they're two junkies

281
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,812
在共用一个针管
sharing a needle.

282
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,581
是啊 不过
Yeah, well,

283
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,218
至少那个女瘾君子知道那男的管子插过哪
at least the lady junkie knows where his needle's been.

284
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,900
我觉得她都不知道自己的名字
I don't even think she knows her name.

285
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,901
她那是深藏不露
Well, she knows more than she's letting on.

286
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:34,336
她其实什么都知道
She knows everything.

287
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,172
你们在这待了有段时间了
You guys had been here for a while.

288
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,045
这地方哪里偷吃最方便?
Where's the best place to steal some food?

289
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:39,874
- Max!  - 抱歉 抱歉
- Max!  - Sorry, sorry.

290
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,795
有范点 那就"睾"点吃的?
Classing it up: Testicles some food?

291
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:47,554
哦 Max 看你这厚脸皮的举止
Oh, Max, I can tell by your sassy demeanor

292
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,814
肯定没看见你的照片吧
you haven't seen your photo yet.

293
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,798
什么照片? 这里没退过支票呀
What photo? I haven't bounced any checks here.

294
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,616
没错 果然是我 好吧
Yep, that's me, all right.

295
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,018
我认出了这"无所谓"的翘唇
I recognize that "I don't care" pout

296
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,622
还有我那肆意随性的卷发
and the Thousand Island dressing in my hair.

297
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:06,524
Max 虽然你的照片被挂在
Max, just because you're hanging on a wall

298
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,427
这个城市最穷苦最底层人群中间
among the poorest, most lost souls in our city

299
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,363
但这并不能说明你的人生就是...
doesn't mean that your life is...

300
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,795
我的照片就在我身后 是吗?
I'm hanging right behind me, aren't I?

301
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,566
天啊!
Oh, my God!

302
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,569
也没那么糟糕 你还穿着衣服呢
It could be worse. You could be naked.

303
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,671
这比裸体还糟糕!
This is worse than being naked!

304
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:27,407
我穿着聚酯的衣服!
I'm wearing polyester!

305
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,376
身为布鲁克林的服务生已经够糟糕的了
It's bad enough I'm a waitress in Brooklyn.

306
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:31,644
现在整个曼哈顿都知道我是服务生了
Now I'm a waitress in Manhattan,

307
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:34,447
而且这些家伙当时连小费都没给!
and these guys didn't even tip!

308
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:38,284
不 不 不 这是摄影作品 所以它是有象征意义的
No, no, no, it's a photograph so it's more symbolic.

309
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:41,179
这幅画的名字是"服务生"
It's called "Waitress"

310
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,866
而且我拿着点菜本
and I'm holding a checkpad.

311
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,662
这些蓝点是什么?
What do all these blue dots mean?

312
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,564
我的照片有问题吗?
Is my picture in trouble?

313
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,734
是说有多少人买了你的照片
That's how many time your print has been purchased.

314
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:01,935
这边 Max 离那个穿着工作服的金发服务生远点
Over here, Max, away from that phatetic blonde lady in the waitress uniform.

315
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:04,779
放轻松 好吗? 没人能认出你
Will you relax? No one even recognized you.

316
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,415
没人? 那个说"我的微笑
No one? What about that art critic

317
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,984
很好地表达了绝望至极 
who said "my smile on the photo

318
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,920
走投无路的悲惨人生"的艺术评论 
"was a study of tragic, foolish optimism

319
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:15,257
又是怎么回事?
in a hopeless, dead-end life"?

320
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,759
他啊
Oh, him.

321
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,680
"绝望至极 走投无路的人生" 更糟糕的是 居然没人买我的照片
"Hopeless, dead-end life"? And then worse, no one buys me?

322
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,915
难道作为一个失败者我也不够成功吗?
I'm not even a success as a failure?

323
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:28,110
你是一个非常成功的失败者
You're totally a sucess as a failure.

324
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,319
那么为什么没有蓝点 Max?
Then where are all the blue dots , Max?

325
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,448
15个人买了你的照片
15 people bought you.

326
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,977
不管你做什么 千万别回头
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

327
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:37,384
看看这些蓝点!
Look at these dots!

328
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,352
我要跟这些人回家...
I am going home with all these people...

329
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:47,095
不管是男人 女人 黑人 白人
man, woman, black, white.

330
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:50,900
就像七十年代在Joe Namath家里的性派对
It's like a key party at Joe Namath's house in the '70s.

331
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,649
嘿 搞笑妞!
Hey, Shecky!

332
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,305
你为什么要把蓝点放在你朋友的照片下面?
Why are you putting the dots by your friend's photo?

333
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,377
凭这些照片赚来的巨款
How many extra croutons can you buy

334
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,017
够你买多少面包丁?
with the buttload of money you're making from these photos?

335
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:08,882
不计其数
A buttload.

336
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,423
好吧 好吧 我知道你很生气 这样吧
Okay, okay, I get it, you're mad. Tell you what.

337
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:14,954
我免费给你一份照片的副本
I will give you a free print of your photo.

338
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,634
听着 留着你的照片吧
Look, keep the photo.

339
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,095
我可不想要一张跟番茄酱的结婚照
I don't want a picute of me marrying ketchups.

340
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,485
我不想要一张和任何人的结婚照
I don't want a picture of me marrying anybody.

341
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:25,001
但是你可以用另一种办法补偿我
But you can pay me back in another way.

342
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:28,032
我跟你说过了 我不是同性恋 我只不过戴了顶帽子!
I told you. I'm not a lesbian. I just wear hat!

343
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,937
你的朋友说你讨厌你的照片
Your friend said you hated your photo.

344
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:38,069
不! 我非常喜欢在给某人
No! I enjoyed being secretly photographed

345
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,573
偷拿超多额外面包丁的时候被偷拍
while I'm stealing someone extra, extra croutons.

346
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:42,907
我郑重声明
For the record,

347
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,910
我从来不觉得你的微笑是愚蠢的
I never saw your smile as foolish.

348
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:47,579
我只不过觉得笑得 呃...
I saw it as, uh...

349
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,414
有点过头
just a little big.

350
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,450
呃... 我是想夸奖你来着
Uh... I'm trying to pay you a compliment.

351
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:54,385
那你失败了
Well, you failed.

352
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,988
这么长时间 当你看着我的时候
All this time, when you looked at me,

353
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,923
我以为你发现了我的与众不同
I thought you saw something special,

354
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:01,659
但是你真正看到的却是在看打折信息的穷妹子
but all you really saw was someone reading the specials.

355
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,128
我有个问题
I have a question for you.

356
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,731
好吧 我坦白 我戴帽子 
Okay, fine. I wear the derby

357
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:10,368
是因为我有些秃顶
because I have a little bit of a bald spot.

358
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,071
为什么没人买我?
Why didn't I sell?

359
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,006
这张照片太逊了
The picture sucks.

360
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,707
是我最差的作品之一
One of my worst.

361
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,643
如果这也是你的赞赏
If you're still trying to give me a compliment,

362
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:19,911
你还是失败了
you're still failing.

363
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,079
听着 好的照片
Look, a good photograph

364
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,015
能抓住真实
captures the truth.

365
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,784
我猜没人真的相信
And I guess no one really believes

366
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,220
你是一个服务生
you as a waitress.

367
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:34,592
这是我听过的最动听的话了
That is the single nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

368
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:37,061
这不是你想要的人生... 我知道
So it's not where you wanna be... I get it.

369
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:40,765
听着 我用了五十年去发现我自己
Look, it's taken me 50 years to be where I am.

370
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:44,802
而你还这么年轻
And you are still so young.

371
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,937
这是我听过的
That is the second-nicest thing

372
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,806
第二动听的话!
anyone's ever said to me!

373
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:52,209
人生路还很长 相信我
The road is long, and trust me,

374
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:55,479
这条路也非常艰难
it can be really hard.

375
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:57,348
不管你做什么
So whatever you do,

376
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,751
你都要保持你那傻傻的充满希望的微笑
you hold on to that foolishly hopeful smile.

377
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:04,922
还有... 和那个搞笑朋友的友谊
And... your funny friend.

378
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:07,057
- 好吗?  - 好的
- Yes?  - Yes.

379
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,894
大家好 今晚我们
Uh, everyone, tonight we are witness

380
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,530
共同见证了
to the amazing work

381
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,332
Nola Anderz令人惊叹的作品
of Nola Anderz.

382
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,503
为什么我们不站在这里
Why don't we all just stand here quietly

383
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:24,508
安静地聆听Nola的作品
for a moment and let Nola's pictures speak.

384
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,047
我的手机 在哪?
That's my phone. Where is it?

385
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:36,420
亲爱的 为什么我的手机在你的胸罩里?
Baby, why is my phone in your bra?

386
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,188
嘘 请安静!
Shh, please!

387
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,291
这是你的秘密手机! 我全都知道了
It's your secret phone! I know all about it.

388
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,627
你把它偷走了? 还给我
You took it? Give it to me.

389
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:46,763
她是谁 Oleg? 那个可恶的老婊子是谁?
Who is she, Oleg? Who is this skanky old whore?

390
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,899
保安! 保安! 
Security! Security!

391
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,402
什么... 不 不 不! 住手 住手... 她拿了我的手机
What... no, no, no! Stop, stop... she has my phone.

392
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,137
各位 这是他的一次"性"手机!
It's his boner phone, everybody!

393
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,939
是他的一次"性"手机!
It's his boner phone!

394
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,977
你够"睾"明 知道我
And you had the testicles to think

395
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:03,813
差点让你难堪了
I was gonna embarrass you.

396
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,286
嘿 Sophie
Hey, Sophie.

397
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,720
嘿 姑娘们
Hey, girls.

398
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,389
你们听见了吗?
Did you hear that?

399
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,924
听起来像是... 我不确定
It sounds a little bit like... I don't know.

400
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,660
像是偷腥的声音呢
The sound of cheating.

401
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:19,763
你们还没和好吗?
You guys haven't made up yet?

402
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,197
别在这儿和好 
Don't make up here.

403
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,400
没有 我在沙发上睡的
No. I slept on the couch.

404
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,568
我太想念她了 我看了一部浪漫爱情片
I missed her so much, I watched a romcom

405
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,072
吃了一整盒她的可食用内衣
while eating a whole box of her edible underwear.

406
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,608
还是不跟我说话吗 Sophie?
Still not talking to me, Sophie?

407
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,878
最后一次声明 除了你 我没有别的女人
For the last time, there's nobody else but you.

408
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,180
- 我用那个电话...  - 怎么了?
- I use that phone...  - Yes?

409
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:38,948
- 去...  - 继续啊

410
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,584
- 我用它...  - 干脆利落点!
- I use it to call...  - Cut to the chase!

411
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,653
给妈妈打电话
My mother.

412
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,990
有他不睡的女人吗?
Is there no one he won't sleep with?

413
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,791
我没告诉你是因为
I didn't tell you because

414
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,693
我不想让你觉得我恋母
I didn't want you to think I was a mama's boy.

415
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:53,596
除了我们玩"妈妈和孩子"游戏的时候
Except when we play "Mama and Boy."

416
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,264
好吧...
Well...

417
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,066
我的跟你说我在扬基蜡烛店
I'll tell you what I told that girl

418
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,502
跟那个女孩说的话
at the Yankee Candle store.

419
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,971
"我不会买的!(我才不信呢!)"
"I'm not buyin' it!"

420
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,106
是真的 Sophie
It's true, Sophie.

421
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:07,443
我有点害怕... 我正在掉头发
I'm afraid I'm... losing my hair.

422
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,147
哦... Oleg
Oh... Oleg.

423
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,249
但是你不知道...
But don't you know...

424
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:17,253
我是说 即使你比十五年前的杰里米·皮文
I mean, you could be balder than Jeremy Piven was

425
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:21,957
头发还秃 我依然爱你
15 years ago, and I'd still love ya.

426
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:28,998
我的电话呢...
Where's my...

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,034
被发现了
Busted.

428
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:35,604
Caroline 我有东西要给你
Caroline, I have something for you.

429
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,573
我不要再在巨大的生日卡片上
I'm not signing another one of those

430
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:40,576
签名了
giant birthday cards again.

431
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,182
是我的照片
It's my picture.

432
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:50,219
没错 现在我有两个不工作的你了
Great. Now I have two of you that don't wait on tables.

433
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,654
"谢谢你的面包丁 Nola"
"Thanks for the croutons. Nola."

434
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,823
Max 我们把我挂在哪里呢?
Max, where are we gonna hang me?

435
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,625
或许你可以把自己挂在洗手间(在洗手间上吊)
Maybe you should hang yourself in the bathroom

436
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:59,094
我三年前就认为你会这么干了
like I thought you would three years ago.

437
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:02,164
没错 我还赌输了二十块钱
Yep. I lost $20 on that bet.

438
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,632
要知道 Max
You know, Max,

439
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:06,101
或许我该正视并接纳我的生活
maybe I have to stop running away from this part of my life

440
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,637
把这段日子当作我的经历
and embrace it, see it as part of my journey,
