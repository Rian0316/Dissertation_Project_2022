00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,703
I've been corresponding
with Dr. John Sturgis

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,004
at East Texas Tech.

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,040
He said I could audit
his course.

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,975
Connie, I would like
to see you again.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,910
Perhaps we could have
dinner sometime.

7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,046
Yes, we would love that.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,547
We would?

9
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,549
If they get married,
we immediately double

10
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,751
the number of smart people
in our family.

11
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,686
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.

12
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,155
Hello, Sheldon.

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,592
Can you see yourself
living here? I can.

Now, who on earth is that?

19
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,743
And don't be picking out
all the chunks.

20
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,111
Aw.

21
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,951
Sorry I'm a little late.

22
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,588

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,792
I'm John Sturgis.

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,627
Sheldon invited me to dinner.

26
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,296
Aha.

27
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,432
Okay. Um, come in, I guess.

28

This is for you.

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,140
It's cheese and
summer sausages.

32
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,775
Thank you.

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,811
Summer sausage means it
doesn't need to be refrigerated.

34
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,079
Is that so?

35
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,280
It is.

36
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,982
Okay. Sheldon?

37
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,650
Dr. Sturgis, welcome.

38
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,052
Thank you, Sheldon.

39
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,054
Sheldon, you think
you might've let me know

40
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,822
you invited company
over for dinner?

41
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,959
I did think about it, but
I was afraid you might say no.

42
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,327
Come see my train set.

43
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,462

You mean he just showed up
out of nowhere?

51
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,393
Yep. He's out in the garage
playing trains with Sheldon.

52
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,662
Why's your hair wet?

53
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,964
If you must know,
I was doing my water aerobics,

54
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,666
and my swimming cap fell off.

55
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,868
This Sturgis fella didn't
say a word to you?

56
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,171
If he did, do you think I would
have been doing frog kicks

57
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,206

O gauge trains
are definitely the best.

<i>Oh,</i> yes, they are.

(chuckles)

63
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,188
Oh, well,
what a pleasant surprise.

64
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,989
Oh, good. You're here, too.

65
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,824
I am.

66
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,892
Are y'all about ready
for dinner?

67
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,194
I am.

68
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,029
Well, then, let's go.

69
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,730
Meemaw, you smell like chlorine.

70
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,266
Why say it?
Hmm.

71
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,837
You weren't kidding.

72
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,074
Spaghetti and hot dogs
is delightful.

73
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,375
SHELDON:
Even better

74
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,077
since Mom perfected
the chunk ratio.

75
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,913
So, Dr. Sturgis,
Sheldon tells us

76
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,848
you're a guest professor
at the university.

77
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,217
I am.
Hmm.

78
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,319
Does that mean that
you're only here temporarily?

79
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,288
Well, that's the plan for now.

80
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,459
But I could be enticed to stay.

81
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,562
Meemaw, I do believe
there was subtext there.

82
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,863
Did you pick up on it?

83
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,098
Yeah.

84
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,500
Was I correct to infer
there was subtext there?

85
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,568
You were.

86
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,604
Okay, we're all good.

87
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,540
I can't believe
they're making me sit and eat

88
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,874
at the kiddie table.

89
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,409
It's better here.

90
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,611
How?

91
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,212
We don't have to pray,
eat our vegetables,

92
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,680
and we can curse.

93
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,515
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

94
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,319
Course I am, you ass-face.

95
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,421
SHELDON: Dr. Sturgis,
do you think

96
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,056
we're ever going
to unify gravity

97
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,225
with the other three
fundamental forces?

98
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,428
I have a sticky note
on my refrigerator

99
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,365
which reminds me every day
to do just that.

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,967
(chuckles)
When did you decide
to focus your research

101
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,269
on quantum...
Um, Sheldon, I think

102
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,704
you're kind of dominating
the conversation.

103
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,307
Why don't you let your
meemaw talk to Dr. Sturgis.

104
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,976
Oh, I'm sorry. By all means.

105
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,077
Thank you.

106
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,913
Connie?
Yes, John.

107
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,818
Do you smell like chlorine
on purpose?

108
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,656
You sure I can't give you
a ride home?

109
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,557
I can throw your bike
in the back of my pickup truck.

110
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,627
Thank you, no.
I-I enjoy the night air.

111
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,728
Plus,

112
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,829
hot dogs and spaghetti

113
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,564
is a highly caloric event

114
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,734
that demands an aerobic
effort on my part.

115
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,304
Well, it was a pleasure
spending the evening with you.

116
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,905
We should do it again sometime.

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,273
Great. When?

118
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,474
How about tomorrow?

119
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,343
(sputters) You know what,
we'll figure it out.

120
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,845
Come on, let me see you
to your Schwinn.

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,314
Bye.

122
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,182
Good night.
(chuckles)

123
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,618
Well, that was
the most stimulating dinner

124
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,186
I've ever had in this house.

125
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,487
Glad you enjoyed it.

126
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,756
That man is a true role model.

127
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,192
Well, it's nice you finally
got a man you can look up to.

128
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,028
Oh, believe me, I know.

129
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,205
You gonna keep it
all bottled up,

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,307
or you want to
talk about it?
What?

131
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,009
I'm fine.

132
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,210
There's nothing to talk about.

133
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,279
You sure?
Yeah.

134
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,881
Sweet dreams.

135
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,056
You know you want
to talk about it.

136
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,524
You saw it.

137
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,860
My own son can't even imagine me
being a role model?

138
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,628
How am I supposed to
be okay with that?

139
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,797
You're a role
model for Georgie.

140
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,032
I used to be.

141
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,234
Now he wants to grow up
and be Tony Danza.

142
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,570
Did you forget you
have a daughter

143
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,138
who would really benefit

144
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,540
from having a good
man to look up to?

145
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,376
Oh, dear Lord.

146
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,411
You<i> did</i> forget.
(scoffs)

147
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,012
I didn't forget. I just...

148
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,415
I don't know how
to spend time with her.

149
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,716
It ain't rocket
science, George.

150
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,917
She's a little girl.

151
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,319
Ask her what she wants to do,

152
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,887
and then do it with her.

153
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,156
Oh, yeah. I suppose.

154
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,359
Trust me. She'll be thrilled
to spend some time with you.

155
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,761
Okay.

156
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,197
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

157
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,068
Hey, when we do, you know,
whatever it is she likes to do,

158
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,369
you're gonna be there, right?

159
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,637
No.

160
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,408
Well, this just got harder.

161
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,110
(groans)

162
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,116
Meemaw?

163
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,051
Meemaw!

164
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,586
What?

165
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,388
I've been researching things

166
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,390
that you and I can do
with Dr. Sturgis.

167
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,758
There's a lecture tonight

168
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,226
at Rice University called

169
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,295
"What's happening
at the center of our galaxy."

170
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,863
Let me just stop you
right there.

171
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,932
Don't worry. I know
what's happening at the center,

172
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,934
but I would never spoil it
for you.

173
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,936
Look, I know you're invested

174
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,638
in me and John
having a relationship,

175
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,273
and I'm not saying we won't.

176
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,409
But it ain't gonna happen
with you always underfoot.

177
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,944
Have I been underfoot?

178
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,981
Honey, in order for grown-ups
to get to know each other,

179
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,717
they need to have
some alone time.

180
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,321
What if I'm around,
but I took a vow of silence?

And then she said for grown-ups
to get to know each other,

183
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,962
they have to have time alone.

184
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,131
Makes sense. What else?

185
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,801
Apparently my being underfoot
isn't conducive to romance.

186
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,570
This is very helpful.

187
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,904
Thank you.

188
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,107
I'm at your service.

189
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,615
Oh, Celeste, why do you always

190
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,783

GEORGE SR.:
Hey.

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,352
Hi, Dad.

193
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,787
What you doing?

194
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,322
Am I in trouble?

195
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,291
No, no.
Just-just checking in on you.

196
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,459
Why?

197
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,696
'Cause you're my daughter
and I love you.

198
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,331
This is getting weird.

199
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,966
It is. I was just
thinking that, uh,

200
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,701
you and me, you know,

201
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,369
we don't spend much
time together.

202
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,471
You know, we should
find something to do,

203
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,173
just-just two of us.

204
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,307
Like what?
You tell me.

205
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,743
What-what sounds fun?

206
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,480
I'd like to be taken to dinner.

207
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,016
Great. Where?

208
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,486
To the fanciest restaurant
in all of Texas.

209
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,821
Which is...?

210
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,191
Red Lobster,
where the surf meets the turf.

211
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,960
You got it.

212
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,128
Thanks, Dad.

213
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,230
Mom, you got to
take me shopping!

214
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,666

How are you?

220
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,411
I chipped a tooth
on a peach pit this morning,

221
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,813
but otherwise, I'm okay.

222
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,315
Good. Good to hear it.

223
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,816

224
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,185
I would like to have dinner
with you tonight,

225
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,687
just the two of us.

226
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,491
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

227
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,192
What'd you have in mind?

228
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:53,064
I'd like to come to your house
and cook you a Szechuan feast.

229
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,566
I'm sorry, a what?

230
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,767
Szechuan.

231
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,536

of Chinese cooking I learned

232
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,772

through China.

233
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,775
Well, wonderful.
I would love that.

234
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,877
Great. Do you have a wok?

235
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,845
I do not.

236
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,013
Not a problem.

237
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,448
I have a travel wok.

238
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,617
Okay.

239
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,853
Uh, so, uh,
what do you say about 6:00?

00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,604
because it
induces sweating,

363
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,907
which in turn,
cools people off.

364
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,509
So what does the runny nose
do for me?

365
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,212
It allows me to, uh,

366
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,782
gallantly offer you
my handkerchief.

367
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,450
You are such a gentleman.

368
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,618
When I was younger,

369
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,954
I read a book
on etiquette.

370
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,589
That's how I know

371
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,624
that if I ever have an
audience at the Vatican,

372
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,527
I should wear evening
attire or a sack coat.

373
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,463
(laughs) I don't know
what a sack coat is,

374
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,267
but I'm sure
you'd look handsome in it.

375
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,837
Thank you.

376
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,276
You know, it's a long
bike ride at night.

377
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,779
If you want...

378
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,415
you're welcome to stay.

379
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,918
No, it's fine, I-I have
a headlight on my bicycle.

380
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,621
Oh, sure, sure.

381
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,925
Although, I hear
it might rain.

382
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,163
No worries. I have
a pocket poncho.

383
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,198
So you do.

384
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,268
John.

385
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,837
I'm inviting you

386
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,573
to spend the night.

387
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,775
Oh.

388
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,146
No, thank you.

389
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,753
Don't they make babies
that are born too soon

390
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,988
stay in the hospital?

391
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:01,125
Normally, yes, but you were born

392
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,961
with such a great head
full of hair

393
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,630
that they sent you home with us.

394
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,400
That's the first thing you've
said that makes sense.

395
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,770
I'm glad we had dinner;
this was nice.

396
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,439
Yeah, fun stuff.

397
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,743
Well, don't want to miss
<i>Who's The Boss.</i>

398
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,615
Lord, forgive me for lying.

399
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,484
I'll tell him the truth
when he's 30. Amen.

400
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,152
<i>(Who's The Boss</i> theme music
plays on TV)

401
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,221
Your lobster, madam.

402
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,990
Thank you.

403
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,494
SERVER: Would you like me
to open it for her?

404
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,862
GEORGE SR.:
Oh, I got it, thanks.

405
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,234
You all right?
This thing's
freaking me out.

406
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,837
Here, let me help you with that.

407
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,174
Here. Okay.

408
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,576
The trick is not
to make eye contact.

409
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,478
Tell him.

410
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,980
Here.

411
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,083
All right, now,
we just... snap her off

412
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,652
like that... pop.

413
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,255
Grab this guy here,

414
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,190
and we crack the claw.

415
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,894
And then you take out
a little meat...

416
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,063
dunk it in some butter,

417
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,931
and then you eat it.

418
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,568
Holy moly.

419
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,769
It's good, huh?

420
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,870
Unbelievable.

421
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,606
I'll leave you to it.

422
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,243
No. Sit with me.

423
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,413
Okay.

424
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,285
When I grow up, I'm gonna
eat lobster every night.

425
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,288
Well, hon, you better stay in
school and get a good education.

426
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,124
I was thinking I'd
just marry a rich guy.

427
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,127
Sure, that's a way to go.

428
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,596
Or a guy who works
at Red Lobster.

429
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,598
That's another way to go.

430
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,481
You seem quiet.
Is everything okay?

431
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,550
Are you not interested in me?

432
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,220
Of course I am.
I'm very interested.

433
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,255
Then how come when I...

434
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,792
I invited you to spend
the night, I got rejected?

435
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,894
I did do that, didn't I?

436
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,963
Good Lord, yes.

437
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,664
I can explain.

438
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,999
Please do.

439
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,569
I didn't want you
to think that I would think

440
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,304
that you were
the sort of woman

441
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,106
who would engage in coitus

442
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,575
simply because I cooked you
a Szechuan dinner.

443
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,577
It was better
before you explained.

444
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,348
All right, let me try
a different tack.

445
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,685
Connie.

446
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,953
Oh, boy.

447
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,655
Would you honor me
with an evening

448
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,925
of intimate relations?

449
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,228
Well, that is
a different tack.

450
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,216
This is very promising.

451
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,817
What's happening?

452
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,820
Dr. Sturgis's bike
is still at Meemaw's.

453
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:17,888
So?

454
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,124
That means he probably is, too.

455
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,293
You need to get a life.

456
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,861
(gasps) There he is.

457
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,971
Mom, Mom, Mom.

458
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,506
What's wrong?
What's going on?

459
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,242
Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw
had their first sleepover.

460
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,344
It's a big step in
their relationship.

461
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,646
I'm going to go
congratulate them.

462
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,915
Hey, put on a jacket,
it's chilly out.

463
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,550
Will do!

464
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,319
Or try saying he can't go.

465
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,254
Oh, never mind,
you can't go!

466
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,156
SHELDON: The last thing
I heard was jacket!

467
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,225
(groans):
Oh.
