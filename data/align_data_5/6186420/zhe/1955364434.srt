# 除了让三角旗飞扬 #
# Than to fly a pennant #

10
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:28,671
# 普通旗子或横幅迎风招展 #
# Flag or banner #

11
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:29,939
# 填充了我内心 #
# What fills my heart #

12
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,608
# 使我眼里常含泪水的 #
# And makes my eyes moist #

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,776
# 就是把旗子 #
# Sending a flag #

14
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:36,012
# 高高地升上旗杆顶端 #
# Up a pole on a hoist #

15
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,680
# 旗乐无穷 #
# Fun with flags #

16
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:39,015
# 旗乐无穷 #
# Fun with flags #

# 这就是旗乐无穷 #
# It's fun with flags #

00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:47,056
# 旗乐无穷 #
# Fun with flags. #

20
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:53,329
你们也看到了 节目众多改变之一就是
As you may notice, just one of the changes around here

21
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,831
有了我们的专属乐队
is our new house band.

22
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:01,604
还想跟我们抢镜头呢
Who haven't learned their place yet.

23
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:08,277
改变之二就是 我们换了个直播地点
We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.

24
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:11,580
Fowler博士和我开始了同居实验
Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together

25
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:13,983
因为她的公寓被水淹了
after her apartment became water damaged.

26
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,252
这是我们的朋友Penny家
This is our friend Penny's place.

27
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,354
你们可能在"旗子"或者
You may remember her from our episode "Flags".

28
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:22,725
"不了解它们的人"这两期节目中听说过她
And "The People Who Don't Understand Them."

29
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:24,794
本着同居的精神
So, in the spirit of cohabitation,

30
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:27,797
今天这期节目的主题就是两个地区的旗子
the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions

31
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,965
组合成了一个的故事
coming together as one.

32
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,636
比如圣基茨和尼维斯
Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.

33
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:38,107
所以 我们卷起袖子来了解下尼维斯吧
So, let's roll up our "sleevis" and get to know Nevis.

34
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:44,180
我喜欢这个 不过下次跟我说一声
Well, I-I like that, but next time check with me.

35
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,483
你知道这个旗子是
Did you know that the flag

36
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,418
一个名叫Edrice Lewis的学生设计的吗...
was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis...

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,287
真不敢相信我会说这种话 不过我们不能看看新闻
I can't believe I'm saying this, but can we watch the news

38
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:54,256
什么的吗?
or something?

39
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,059
很好啊 他们同居得很开心
It's cute, they're having fun living together.

40
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,094
是啊 我在想她公寓修好之后
Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do

41
00:01:58,096 --> 00:01:59,695
他们要怎么办
when her apartment's ready.

42
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,464
其实 好几个星期前就修好了
Actually, it's been ready for weeks.

43
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:02,531
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

44
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,400
他们早完工了
Well, they finished the work early,

45
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,435
但她一直和Sheldon说他们工期延误了
but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.

46
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,971
所以 她就这么一直骗他吗?
So, she's just been lying to him?

47
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,473
你也骗过Sheldon啊
Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

48
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,941
对啊 但我是想让他离开
Yeah, but to make him leave,

49
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:13,843
不是想留下他
not to make him stay.

50
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:19,982
布达和佩斯联合在一起组成了布达佩斯
Buda and Pest united to form Budapest.

51
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,984
这就是为什么布达佩斯
And that's why Budapest

52
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:24,186
是"布达倍儿棒"
"Budabest."

53
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:27,456
就是现在
Now.

54
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,693
哦 好吧
Oh, right.

00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:35,664
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

56
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,402
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

57
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,936
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

58
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,472
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

59
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,142
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall * * We built the pyramids *

60
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,811
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

61
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,713
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

62
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:51,500

谢谢你们的服务 先生们
Thank you for your services, gentlemen.

67
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:04,964
现在我希望
Now, I'm hoping

68
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:05,965
用你们的摇滚乐
to broaden our audience

69
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,835
增加一些观众
with your youthful rock and roll music.

70
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,305
你居然认为你有观众 真是好笑
You think you have an audience, that's funny.

71
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,609
我们拿不到工钱吗? 什么都没有?
We don't get paid? Nothing?

72
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,545
三明治都没有?
Not even a sandwich?

73
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,749
都快晚饭时间了
It's almost dinner time.

74
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,217
你想吃什么吗?
You in the mood for anything?

75
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,486
我们可以去你家附近吃泰国菜
Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment

76
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:28,655
然后顺路进去看一下进度
and then drop in and check on the progress.

77
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,227
你不会想去看它的 那是施工区
Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.

78
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,562
那又怎样?
So?

79
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,833
你对到处乱丢的钉子和屁股沟的恐惧呢?
Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?

80
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,001
我很害怕踩到钉子上
I am terrified of stepping on a nail

81
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,670
还有掉进屁股沟里
and falling into a butt crack.

82
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,441
随便吧 晚饭怎么办?
Anyway, how about dinner?

83
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:49,709
你知道吧 如果你想要的话 我可以
You know, if you'd like, I could

84
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,478
打电话给房东投诉这个
call your landlord and complain.

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,180
谢谢 但是你没有必要
Thanks, but you don't have to.

86
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,583
我不介意啊 我很擅长投诉的
Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good at complaining.

87
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,819
如果是奥运体育项目的话 我会投诉
If it were an Olympic sport, I'd complain about

88
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,255
这个运动有多么蠢然后自己把金牌带回家
what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold.

89
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,692
说得好
Good stuff.

90
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:09,729
所以 晚上吃什么?
So, uh, what about dinner?

91
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,764
是我想多了
Is it me

92
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,099
还是你总是在故意换话题?
or are you purposely changing the subject?

93
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,101
没有
No.

94
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,870
当说到话题这个话题时
And on the subject of subjects,

95
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,572
你用的"话题"这个词和我们讨论
is your use of the word "subject" the same or different

96
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:22,709
{\an8}subject既有话题也有臣民的意思

97
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:22,709
国王的臣民时意义一样吗?
as when we speak about the subject of a king?

98
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,948
我感觉你还是在换话题
I have a feeling you're still doing it.

99
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,151
但我感觉这个话题不能抵制
But I find that topic irresistible, so,

100
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,420
现在 在古美索不达米亚
now, in ancient Mesopotamia,

101
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:37,390
国王把他的臣民视为他自己的财产
the king referred to the people as his property.

102
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:39,859
我是认真的
I'm serious,

103
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,228
喷气推进实验室已经在开发一种
JPL's actually developing a robot arm

104
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,364
可以在小行星撞击地球之前抓住它的机械臂了
that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.

105
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,468
所以他们把地球从世界末日拯救出来的计划就是
So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon

106
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,672
寄希望于一群科学家来抓个球?
is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?

107
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:56,075
如果我们都要死 我还吃这么多羽衣甘蓝干什么?
If we're all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?

108
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,212
你今天这么安静 还好吗?
You're awful quiet, everything okay?

109
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,315
我很担心Amy
I'm concerned about Amy.

110
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,117
最近她表现地很奇怪
She's acting a bit odd lately.

111
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,386
我就是好奇下
Oh. Well, j-just out of curiosity,

112
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:10,023
什么在你看来是奇怪的?
what registers as odd to you?

113
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,595
她的行为
Her behavior.

114
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,264
我总觉得她瞒着我一些事情
No, I have the feeling that she's hiding something.

115
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,766
没必要这么担心
I wouldn't worry about it.

116
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,768
她可能只是因为工作上的事情觉得困扰罢了
She's probably just distracted by work.

117
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,870
不管是什么吧 我觉得很困扰
Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me.

118
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,538
饭也吃不下 觉也睡不着
And I can't eat, I can't sleep.

119
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,006
更不用说肠胃蠕动的
And don't even ask about the consistency

120
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,008
规律性了
of my bowel movements.

121
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,680
听到了吧 别多嘴瞎问
You heard him, guys, don't ask.

122
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,216
她为什么要对我遮遮掩掩的呢?
Why would she keep something from me, you know?

123
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,718
宝宝可是把处子之身都给她了
I shared my body with that woman.

124
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,888
还有我Netflix的密码
And my Netflix password.

125
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,556
网站还自动推荐了当老牛碰上嫩草
They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back

126
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,892
就是她看多了
because of her.

127
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,461
兄弟 听我说
Buddy, buddy, listen,

128
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,029
没什么大不了的事情
nothing bad is going on,

129
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,866
她只是... 她只是不想你知道
she just... she just didn't want you to know

130
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:56,069
她公寓那里的修理工程几星期之前就完成了
that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.

131
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:59,005
我不明白你的意思
I don't understand.

132
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,907
她享受和你同居的时光
She's enjoying living with you

133
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,909
不希望就这样早早结束了
and she didn't want it to end early.

134
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,778
所以她欺骗了我
So, she's deceiving me

135
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,248
就是为了多和我呆在一起
in order to spend more time with me.

136
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
是的
Yes. Oh.

137
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:14,721
我真是受宠若惊又伤心欲绝啊
Well, I feel both flattered and hurt.

138
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,256
就像别人说我长得像圣诞惊魂夜里的
Like when people say I look like that skeleton

139
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:19,859
那个骷髅头一样
from Nightmare Before Christmas.

140
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,462
我的天呐 真是描绘得出神入化
Oh my God, that's who you look like.

141
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,598
Sheldon 这没什么大不了的
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,066
这是个善意的谎言 我们都说过
It's a little white lie, everyone does it.

143
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,167
我没说过
Not me,

144
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,602
我在我的所有关系当中
I'm a 100% honest

145
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,204
都是百分百坦诚的
in all of my relationships.

146
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,106
所以看看你现在形单影只的可怜样儿
And how single are you right now?

147
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,843
一个人坐在马桶上吃蛋糕的痛
Eating-cake-on-the-toilet single.

148
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,080
我绝不能容忍情感里的欺骗
Well, I won't tolerate deception in my relationship.

149
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,016
除了和她当面对质 我别无选择
I have no choice but to confront her.

150
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,885
别这么做 你现在可是把柄在手
Don't do that, you've got gold here.

151
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,587
好好抓住了 等到你遇到麻烦的时候
Hang onto it until you're in trouble

152
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,956
就可以... 打她个措手不及
and then... throw it in her face.

153
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,024
什么?
What?

154
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,926
你为什么要告诉他这个?
Why would you tell him that?

155
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:54,227
这个建议烂透了
That's terrible advice.

156
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,897
所以你不希望抓到Penny的任何把柄咯?
So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?

157
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,432
当然不希望
Well, of course not.

158
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:03,570
所以 如果我现在真的知道一些内幕的话...
So, if I actually know something right now...

159
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:05,138
实际上我真的知道...
and I do...

160
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,007
你不希望我告诉你吗?
you don't want me to tell you?

161
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,243
这个嘛...
Uh...

162
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,644
当然不了
Pfft, no.

163
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,380
你这态度真是一个大写的"要"啊
I'll take that as a "Yes."

164
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,417
她一直在悄悄把你的收藏品搬到仓库去
She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage

165
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,218
一次一点点 这样你就不会注意到了
a little at a time and you haven't noticed.

166
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,187
你说真的吗?
Are you kidding me?

167
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,622
看吧 我已经知道很久了
See, I've known that for weeks,

168
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,891
但我就等啊等啊
but, you know, I waited till the moment

169
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:28,528
等到对他的伤害达到最大值的时候再说
when it would cause him the most pain.

170
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,603
超人不见了 我的暴风兵也不见了
Superman's gone, my stormtrooper's gone.

171
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,372
你的克林贡版每日一次的日历也不见了
Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone.

172
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,240
我想用克林贡语骂"我去"
I'd say "damn it" in Klingon,

173
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,242
但那个词要到下个月才会学到
but that wasn't until next month.

174
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,044
来 跟我说 "窝趣"
It's "khoo-vakh."

175
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,213
窝趣!
Khoo-vakh!

176
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,582
连我的Waldo藏在哪儿都被她拿走了
She took my Where's Waldo.

177
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,883
没 没 他在那儿呢
Well, no, no, he's over there.

178
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:54,320
哦 原来在这儿啊
Oh, yeah, there he is.

179
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,625
你的公寓怎么样了?
So, what's the deal with your apartment?

180
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,226
怎么修了这么久啊?
Why's it taking so long?

181
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:03,296
是干式墙出了问题
Um, it was a drywall problem.

182
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:06,766
不会吧 出了什么事?
Oh, no, what happened?

183
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:11,671
就是干式墙湿了  没人想要湿了的干式墙是不是
Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall

184
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:15,775
因为干式墙湿了的时候 就变成了...
because when drywall gets wet, it's really more...

185
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,611
湿式墙?
Wet wall?

186
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:22,415
说潮墙也行 都差不多
Or damp wall, just as bad. Mm.

187
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,652
那他们怎么不多买点干式墙呢?
So why don't they just get more drywall?

188
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,388
他们去买了的
Well, they went to get some,

189
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,692
但是墙面专卖店的人说
but the woman at the wall store

190
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:34,360
干式墙最近热销 所以他们要等着
said it was going on sale and they should wait

191
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:37,330
因为库存... 真是够了 你说完了吗?
because the savings... Okay, are you done?

192
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,065
Bernadette告诉我你的公寓已经修好了
Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.

193
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:43,036
我说到湿式墙的时候就打算停了 但你一直抓着不放
I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn't let it go.

194
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,905
但Sheldon真的信了这些鬼话吗?
But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?

195
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,675
他确实开始怀疑了 但我假装对着他打了个喷嚏
Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him

196
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,678
之后他就去洗澡了
and he ran to take a shower.

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,447
你千万要帮我保密 我已经够挣扎的了
Please don't say anything, I feel terrible about this.

198
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,648
别担心 我嘴很严的
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

199
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,816
谢谢
Thanks.

200
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:02,155
"墙面专卖店的女人"? 别再抓着不放了!
"The woman at the wall store?" Let it go!

201
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,092
你要和Penny当面对质吗?
Are you going to confront Penny?

202
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,660
迟早是要的
Eventually, I guess.

203
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:10,063
但我我也有点好奇 她觉得她能在我
Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks

204
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,131
没有发现的情况下把我的东西藏多久
she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.

205
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,833
这个嘛
Hmm.

206
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:17,003
与其和她们当面对质
You know, perhaps instead of confronting them,

207
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,905
我们应该看看她们要怎么使出瞬身解数
we should see how far they're willing to spin

208
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,440
来一个谎圆一个谎
their tangled webs.

209
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,041
就像那个之前在你桌子上的
Like that Spider-Man action figure

210
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,711
蜘蛛侠手办一样
that used to be on your desk.

211
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:27,580
天哪 我是瞎了吗?
Oh, my God, I'm going blind.

212
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,483
饭来咯
Hi. Food's here.

213
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,285
噢
Oh.

214
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,152
太棒了
Excellent.

215
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,621
我都饿坏了
I'm very hungry.

216
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:36,689
话说回来
Yeah, speaking of which,

217
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,591
你的公寓怎么样了?
what's going on with your apartment?

218
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:42,328
还在施工呢
Oh, uh, they're still working on it.

219
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,529
有意思
Interesting.

220
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,099
真有意思啊
Very interesting.

221
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,802
是啊 我们去饭店的路上顺道去看了下她的公寓
Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant,

222
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:51,104
装修还需要一阵子
and they're gonna be fixing it for a while.

223
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:54,941
等等...你去看过她的公寓了?
Wait, uh... you saw her apartment?

224
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,310
我去了 还是一团乱
I did, still a mess.

225
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,282
- Leonard?  - 嗯?
- Leonard?  - Yeah?

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,000
我搞不懂了

227
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Penny在说谎吗?

228
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
我不确定

229
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,798
你们...为什么要说克林贡语?
W...Why are you speaking Klingon?

230
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,901
那你为什么要说英语?
Why are you speaking English?

231
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:24,036
可笑
This is ridiculous.

232
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:25,404
Penny 你记得
Penny, do you remember

233
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,539
我教你的鸟语吗?
when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?

234
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,539
当然记得

235
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,539
很好

236
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Shledon是不是知道我在骗他?

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
如果Leonard告诉他

238
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,539
那可能就知道了

239
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,825
喂喂喂 停下来
Oh, wait, stop that.

240
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:46,959
要停下来的是你们
You stop that.

241
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,959
你听得懂她们说什么吗?

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
不懂

243
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,000
该死

244
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,265
好了好了
Okay.

245
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,900
够了 
That's enough. You know what?

246
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,068
这是在干嘛?
What is going on?

247
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,070
好吧 我跟Sheldon说
Fine, I told Sheldon that

248
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,238
她的公寓已经装修好了
her apartment's been finished,

249
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,640
但刚刚你又说还没有
but then you just said it's not,

250
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:01,507
所以我现在懵逼了
so now I'm all confused.

251
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,510
Penny只是在帮我隐瞒
Penny was just covering for me.

252
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,546
我的房子两周前就弄好了
My place has been ready for two weeks.

253
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,247
你怎么可以骗我?
How could you lie to me?

254
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,315
她喜欢跟你住一起
Uh, she's enjoyed living with you.

255
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,616
这叫爱
It's called being in love.

256
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,185
那么
Mm-hmm, and what's it called

257
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:13,286
你偷偷搬走
when you secretly get rid

258
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,720
你老公的所有东西又叫什么?
of all your husband's stuff?

259
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,856
什么...没有的事!
Wha... That is not true!

260
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,658
什么没有... Bernadette告诉Howard Howard又告诉了我
Wh-wh-wh... Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me.

261
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,060
而且 我能看到我的东西都不见了!
Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!

262
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,163
所以 你相信你朋友 你朋友的老婆
Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife

263
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,132
还有你的眼睛 多过相信我咯?
and your own eyes over me?

264
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,429
哇
Wow.

265
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,447
你真的觉得我没有注意到
You really didn't think I'd notice

266
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,748
我的东西不见了吗?
my stuff was missing?

267
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,817
是吗 你看到你的钥匙环了吗?
Uh, did you notice your key chain?

268
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,324
蝙蝠侠哪去了?!
Where's Batman?!

269
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,160
嗨
Hey.

270
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,161
你为什么要告诉Howard
Why did you tell Howard

271
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,395
我把Leonard的东西藏起来了?
I was hiding Leonard's things?

272
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,129
等会
One sec.

273
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,164
你为什么要告诉Leonard
Why did you tell Leonard

274
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,299
我告诉了你Penny藏起了他的东西?!
I told you Penny was hiding his things?!

275
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,301
我只是顺口一说
It just came up

276
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,804
因为我们...我们讲秘密然后...
because we... we were talking about secrets and...

277
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:05,900
有谁是知道Amy公寓的事的?

278
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,138
等等
Wait.

279
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:09,542
你们都给我闭嘴!
Everybody stop it with that!

280
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,178
这真的不关我的事
I'm not really a part of this,

281
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,447
所以我还是先开吃了
so I'm just gonna dig in.

282
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,716
我不懂你为什么要把
And I'd like to know why you blabbed

283
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,217
我公寓的事说出去
about my apartment.

284
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,585
交给了你 大嘴巴
You're up, blabby.

285
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:23,623
Amy 对不起 我不该说出去的
Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.

286
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,525
其实也没什么关系
I guess it's okay.

287
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,261
对不起
I'm sorry

288
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:30,596
公寓的事我骗了你
that I lied about my apartment.

289
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,565
没关系
It's all right.

290
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,833
然后...
And...

291
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:34,800
然后什么?
And what?

292
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,702
你的巫师袍是我下一个目标
Your wizard robes are next to go.

293
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,640
现在什么都说出来了
Now that everything's out on the table,

294
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,509
你们...你们觉得你们还会继续住在一起吗?
you...you think you two will keep living together?

295
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,846
虽然最近发生了这些事
Despite recent events,

296
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,614
但我认为我们的同居实验
I do consider our experiment

297
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,150
确实进展得挺顺利
in cohabitation to have been positive.

298
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,086
你是在说你愿意跟我住吗?
Are you saying you'd like to live with me?

299
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,722
我不排除这个可能性
I'm open to the possibility.

300
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Amy 淡定

301
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,761
随便吧
Whatever.

302
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,033
哎 如果他以后都住对面了
You know, if he moves across the hall for good,

303
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,234
Leonard就可以把那些你不喜欢的东西
Leonard could keep the stuff you don't like

304
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,335
放在Shledon原来的房间了
in Sheldon's old room.

305

- 那问题就都解决了  - 好主意! 
- Solves everything.  - That's a great idea!

306
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,472
哇 我可以把它改成游戏房
Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.

307
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,373
太棒了
That would be amazing.

308
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,441
等等 等等 停一下 你们想干嘛?
Wait, wait, hold on, do what?

309
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,777
不好意思...那可是我的房间
Excuse me... that's my room.

310
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,078
但你以后不住这里了啊
But you won't be living here.

311
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,513
但那是我的房间
But that's my room.

312
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,048
- 但你以后不住这里了啊  - 但那是我的房间
- But you won't be living here.  - But that's my room.

313
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,316
你们可以开吃了
You guys might want to start eating.

314
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,750
但你以后不住这里了啊
But you won't be living here.

315
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,286
亲爱的 一旦你不再交房租
Sweetie, once you stop paying rent,

316
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,888
这些就全都不是你的
none of this is really yours.

317
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,022
但那是我的房间
But that's my room.

318
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,258
但你以后不住这里了!
But you won't be living here!

319
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:37,263
谢谢你的理解
Thank you for understanding.

320
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,898
哎 我懂的
Hey, I get it.

321
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,734
大家都想跟我待在一起
Everybody wants to spend more time with me.

322
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,705
我人见人爱 花见花开
I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.

323
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,007
晚安
Good night.

324
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,142
好 晚安
Mm, night.

325
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,056
如果我们以后真的要继续住在一起
If we did continue living together,

326
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,591
还是住这里吗?
would it be here?

327
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,427
我不知道
I don't know.

328
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,529
有...有可能
It...it could be.

329
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:11,464
当然我们...
Of course there's...

330
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,999
我们也可以住你那边
there's always your apartment.

331
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,236
当...当然 我们可以住进我的公寓
S... Sure, sure, we... we could live in my apartment.

332
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:19,638
我讨厌你的公寓
I hate your apartment.

333
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,142
怪我咯 也是你先提的吧?
Sorry, you brought it up?

334
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,479
我觉得我们可以找一个新的地方
Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place.

335
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,680
而且 准确来说
You know, and, technically,

336
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,348
我们甚至不需要待在Pasadena
we don't even have to stay in Pasadena.

337
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,251
我们可以...可以搬去Altadena
We could...we could move to Altadena...

338
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:35,221
或者更远的地方
or a place that doesn't even end in "Dena."

339
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,956
听起来很爽
It's kind of exciting.

340
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,992
我们可以想干嘛就可以干嘛
I mean... we could do whatever we want.

341
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,094
但是如果我们搬家后
But what if we move

342
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,896
不喜欢那里呢?
and we don't like it?

343
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,865
如果楼里有个烟鬼呢?
What if there's a smoker in the building?

344
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:46,966
或者有宠物呢?
Or pets?

345
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,502
还有可能有霉菌
Or there could be mold.

346
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,170
那里也有可能会有交通噪音
There could be traffic noise.

347
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:54,006
我还得重新记下一条全新的公交线路
I'm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route.

348
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,014
你是在把"星际迷航"主题曲
Are you trying to soothe me

349
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,650
当摇篮曲唱 想安慰我吗?
by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?

350
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,652
是的
Yes.

351
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,255
我又不是个孩子 别做这种事
I'm not a child, don't do that.

352
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:10,990
抱歉
Sorry.

353
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:18,164
你知道"2001太空漫游"吗?
Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey?

354
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,810
这才对嘛 这才有安慰的感觉
All right, now that's soothing.

355
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,788
听着 我懂 这还是我的房间
Look, I... I get it, this is still my room;

356
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,490
我们还没有把它变成你的一部分
we haven't really made it yours.

357
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:45,724
谢谢
Thank you.

358
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,460
这也是为什么我给你
Which is why I got you

359
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:50,262
买了这个粉色的恐龙战队战士
this Pink Power Ranger.

360
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,132
你想把它放在哪儿都行
Put it anywhere you like.

361
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:56,435
好吧 但是你可能会有些不舒服哦
Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.

362
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:00,239
我开玩笑的啦 我希望你在这里有家的感觉
I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here.

363
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,408
以任何你喜欢的方式来装饰这里吧
Decorate it any way that makes you happy.

364
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,909
你认真的吗?
Do you really mean that?

365
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:04,877
真的
I really do.

366
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,312
太好了 还有啦 你得知道
Great, and just so you know,

367
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,913
我也不是要把你所有的东西都弄走的
I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.

368
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:09,248
是吗? 那你准备留什么呢?
Yeah? What are you keeping?

369
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,816
那个蜡烛
That candle

370
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,284
还有你
and you.

371
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,387
那我的机器人海报呢?
What about my robot poster?

372
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,355
停 停 停 见好就收啊
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

373
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,424
我最多只能忍那个蜡烛
I can make do with just the candle.

374
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:27,399
怎么啦?
What's going on?

375
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:30,569
我一想到要离开我的旧卧室就辗转反侧
I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.

376
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,273
那你能不能就心理转转啊?
Can it be more of an internal struggle?

377
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,243
我得看到它才行
I need to see it.

378
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,246
在我走开期间
While I'm gone,

379
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,948
别往我的枕头上呼气
don't breathe on my pillow.

380
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,884
要不我直接就不呼吸了怎么样啊?
How about if I just don't breathe at all?

381
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:46,919
这才是我的好姑娘
That's my girl.

382
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:55,728
什么鬼?
What on earth?

383
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,443
怎么回事?!
What is going on?!

384
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,112
哎哟 Sheldon
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

385
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,047
我们把你的房间
We turned your room

386
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,515
改成了一个嘿咻地牢
into a sex dungeon.

387
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,084
哦!
Oh!

388
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,020
不!
No!

389
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,588
怎么啦?!
What is happening?!

390
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,127
好了 最后一问
Okay, last question.

391
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,629
他当时穿的裤套...露臀的吗?
The chaps he was wearing... assless?

392
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
我们就不能专注于我现在面临的这个决定吗?
Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing?

393
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,936
行啊 不过讲真
We can, but for the record,

394
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,471
所有裤套都是露臀的
all chaps are assless.

395
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,471
{\an8}裤套是指一般穿在裤子外面 只在腰部而非裆部连接的两个裤腿

396
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,107
先生们 拜托
Gentlemen, please,

397
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,976
这是个重要的决定啊
this is a significant decision.

398
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:47,046
Amy和我是不是要继续同居呢?
Now, do Amy and I continue living together?

399
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,248
还是我要回去再跟Lenard一起住?
Or do I move back in with Leonard?

400
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,517
跟我的露臀裤套一起啊
Over my assless chaps you will.

401
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,954
这不复杂啊
This isn't complicated.

402
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:56,522
你爱Amy吗?
Do you love Amy?

403
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,556
是的
Yes.

404
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,058
那你喜欢跟她同居吗?
Do you like living with her?

405
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,125
是的
Yes.

406
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,528
那你知道你现在要怎么做了吗?
Do you know what you need to do now?

407
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,964
很显然 我得自己想
Apparently, figure this out on my own

408
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,699
因为你们几个一点忙都帮不上
'cause you guys are no help at all.

409
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,053
嗨
Hi.

410
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,355
哈喽
Hello.

411
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,223
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

412
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:36,161
我只是在思考布里丹之驴
I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.

413
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,429
我懂了
I understand.

414
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,597
我会让你自己待着的
I'll leave you be.

415
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,669
什么 你知道这个典故吗?
What, you're familiar with the reference?

416
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:44,970
当然
Of course.

417
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,939
Jean Buridan提出了
Jean Buridan proposed

418
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,474
一个哲学理论 说
a philosophical thesis stating that

419
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,876
一只饥饿的驴被置于两堆同等距离的
a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant

420
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,545
干草堆的时候将会由于无法做出决定
bales of hay would be paralyzed by indecision

421
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,114
从而僵在原地 最终饿死
and would starve to death.

422
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,520
正是
Exactly.

423
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,257
那我不想让你饿死 所以...
Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so...

424
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,594
...这有根茄子
...here's an eggplant.

425
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,797
谢谢
Thank you.

426
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,367
你知道吗 有些人认为Buridan
You know, some people believe that Buridan

427
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,969
是窃取了亚里士多德的想法
was plagiarizing Aristotle.

428
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,504
真的吗?
Really?

429
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,538
不过
Although,

430
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,806
在亚里士多德的例子里
in Aristotle's example,

431
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,642
他提出的是一个饥饿和口渴程度相当的人
he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man

432
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,077
陷在食物和饮品的两难之间
caught between food and drink.

433
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,812
这样啊
Huh.

434
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,080
是的 我在想这是不是跟
Yeah, I wonder if that's related

435
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,416
十二世纪的波斯哲学家
to the 12th century Persian philosopher,

436
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,316
Al-Ghazali有关
Al-Ghazali

437
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,885
他的故事是一个人
and his story of a man

438
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,586
在两个对象中间难以取舍
caught between two dates.

439
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:37,489
你是在说Al-Ghazali是亚里士多德学派的吗?
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian?

440
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:40,626
他可是反亚里士多德学派的
'Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.

441
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:45,197
Al-Ghazali是反亚里士多德学派的吗?
Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?

442
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:47,066
妈呀 还以为我了解他呢
Boy, you think you know a guy.

443
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,038
好了
Okay.

444
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,975
睁开眼睛看看你的新房间吧
Open your eyes and see your new room.

445
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,214
哇
Wow.

446
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:09,750
我...我知道我可能有点过了
I... I know I went a little overboard.

447
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:10,985
我们也还可以稍稍低调一点的啦
We can always dial it back.

448
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,119
不不不
No, no, no, no, no,

449
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,020
对...对我来说
it's... it's important to me

450
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:14,755
你拥有你想要的房间是很重要的
that you have the bedroom you want.

451
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,557
哦 这话太有意义了 我爱你

452
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,125
