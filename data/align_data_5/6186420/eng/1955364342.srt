00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:06,249
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:08,150
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

3
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:11,220
And welcome to the first
"on location" episode of

4
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:14,690
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper and</i>
<i>Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present:</i>

00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:19,195

<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:20,263
Hit it.

As you may notice, just one
of the changes around here

22
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,831
is our new house band.

23
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,567
(plays keyboard solo)

24
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:01,604
Who haven't learned
their place yet.

25
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:08,277
We're also coming to you
live from a different apartment.

26
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:11,580
Dr. Fowler and I began an
experiment in living together

27
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:13,983
after her apartment
became water damaged.

28
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,252
This is our
friend Penny's place.

29
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,354
You may remember her
from our episode

30
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:22,725
"Flags: And the People
Who Don't Understand Them."

31
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:24,794
So, in the spirit
of cohabitation,

32
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:27,797
the theme of today's episode
is flags of two regions

33
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,965
coming together as one.

34
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,636
Such as the flag of
St. Kitts and Nevis.

35
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:38,107
So, let's roll up our
"sleevis" and get to know Nevis.

36
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:39,308
(rimshot)

37
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:44,180
Well, I-I like that, but
next time check with me.

38
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,483
Did you know that the flag

39
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,418
was designed by a student
named Edrice Lewis...

40
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,287
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but can we watch the news

41
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:54,256
or something?

42
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,059
It's cute, they're having
fun living together.

43
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,094
Yeah, I wonder what
they're gonna do

44
00:01:58,096 --> 00:01:59,695
when her apartment's ready.

45
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,464
Actually, it's been
ready for weeks.

46
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:02,531
What do you mean?

47
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,400
Well, they finished
the work early,

48
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,435
but she's been telling Sheldon
they're behind schedule.

49
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,971
So, she's just
been lying to him?

50
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,473
Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

51
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,941
Yeah, but to make him leave,

52
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:13,843
not to make him stay.

53
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:19,982
Buda and Pest
united to form Budapest.

54
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,984
And that's why Budapest

55
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:24,186
"Budabest."

56
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:27,456
Now.

57
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,693
Oh, right.

Thank you for your services,
gentlemen.

69
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:04,964
Now, I'm hoping

70
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:05,965
to broaden our audience

71
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,835
with your youthful
rock and roll music.

72
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,270
(chuckling):
Aw,

73
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,305
you think you have
an audience, that's funny.

74
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,609
We don't get paid?
Nothing?

75
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,545
Not even a sandwich?

76
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,749
It's almost dinner time.

77
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,217
You in the mood for anything?

78
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,486
Yeah, we could get Thai food
near your apartment

79
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:28,655
and then drop in and
check on the progress.

80
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,227
Oh, you don't want do that,
it's a construction zone.

81
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,562
So?

82
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,833
Well, what about your fear of
stray nails and butt cracks?

83
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,001
I am terrified of
stepping on a nail

84
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,670
and falling into a butt crack.

85
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,441
Anyway, how about dinner?

86
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:49,709
You know, if
you'd like, I could

87
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,478
call your landlord and complain.

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,180
Thanks, but you don't have to.

89
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,583
Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good
at complaining.

90
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,819
If it were an Olympic sport,
I'd complain about

91
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,255
what a stupid sport it is
and then I'd take home the gold.

92
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,692
Good stuff.

93
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:09,729
So, uh, what about dinner?

94
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,764
Is it me

95
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,099
or are you purposely
changing the subject?

96
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,101
No.

97
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,870
And on the subject of subjects,

98
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,572
is your use of the word
"subject" the same or different

99
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:22,709
as when we speak about
the subject of a king?

100
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,948
I have a feeling
you're still doing it.

101
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,151
But I find that topic
irresistible, so,

102
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,420
now, in ancient Mesopotamia,

103
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:37,390
the king referred to the people
as his property.

104
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:39,859
I'm serious,

105
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,228
JPL's actually
developing a robot arm

106
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,364
that could grab an asteroid
before it hits us.

107
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,468
So their plan for saving
the Earth from Armageddon

108
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,672
is hoping a bunch of
scientists can catch a ball?

109
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:56,075
If we're all gonna die,
why am I eating so much kale?

110
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,212
You're awful quiet,
everything okay?

111
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,315
I'm concerned about Amy.

112
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,117
She's acting a bit odd lately.

113
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,386
Oh. Well, j-just
out of curiosity,

114
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:10,023
what registers as odd to you?

115
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,226
(laughter)

116
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,595
Her behavior.

117
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,264
No, I have the feeling
that she's hiding something.

118
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,766
I wouldn't worry about it.

119
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,768
She's probably just
distracted by work.

120
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,870
Well, whatever it is,
it's troubling me.

121
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,538
And I can't eat, I can't sleep.

122
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,006
And don't even ask
about the consistency

123
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,008
of my bowel movements.

124
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,680
You heard him, guys,
don't ask.

125
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,216
Why would she keep
something from me, you know?

126
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,718
I shared my body
with that woman.

127
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,888
And my Netflix password.

128
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,556
They recommended
<i>Stella Got Her Groove Back</i>

129
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,892
because of her.

130
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,461
Buddy, buddy, listen,

131
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,029
nothing bad is going on,

132
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,866
she just... she just
didn't want you to know

133
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:56,069
that the work on her apartment
was finished a couple weeks ago.

134
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:59,005
I don't understand.

135
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,907
She's enjoying living with you

136
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,909
and she didn't want it
to end early.

137
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,778
So, she's deceiving me

138
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,248
in order to spend
more time with me.

139
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
Yes.
Oh.

140
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:14,721
Well, I feel both
flattered and hurt.

141
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,256
Like when people say I
look like that skeleton

142
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:19,859
from <i>Nightmare Before Christmas.</i>

143
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,462
Oh my God, that's
who you look like.

144
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,598
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,066
It's a little white lie,
everyone does it.

146
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,167
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Not me,

147
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,602
I'm a 100% honest

148
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,204
in all of my
relationships.

149
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,106
And how single
are you right now?

150
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,843
Eating-cake-on-the-toilet
single.

151
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,080
Well, I won't tolerate
deception in my relationship.

152
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,016
I have no choice
but to confront her.

153
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,885
Don't do that,
you've got gold here.

154
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,587
Hang onto it until
you're in trouble

155
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,956
and then...
throw it in her face.

156
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,024
LEONARD:
What?

157
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,926
Why would you tell him that?

158
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:54,227
That's terrible advice.

159
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,897
So you wouldn't want to
have anything on Penny?

160
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,432
Well, of course not.

161
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:03,570
So, if I actually
know something right now...

162
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:05,138
and I do...

163
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,007
...you don't want me
to tell you?

164
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,243
Uh...

165
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,644
Pfft, no.

166
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,380
I'll take that as a "Yes."

167
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,417
She's secretly been moving
your collectibles into storage

168
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,218
a little at a time
and you haven't noticed.

169
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,187
Are you kidding me?

170
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,622
See, I've known
that for weeks,

171
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,891
but, you know, I waited
till the moment

172
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:28,528
when it would cause him
the most pain.

173
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,603
Superman's gone,
my stormtrooper's gone.

174
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,372
Your Klingon word-of-the-day
calendar's gone.

175
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,240
I'd say "damn it" in Klingon,

176
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,242
but that wasn't until
next month.

177
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,044
It's "khoo-vakh."

178
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,213
Khoo-vakh!

179
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,582
She took my Where's Waldo.

180
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,883
Well, no, no, he's over there.

181
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:54,320
Oh, yeah, there he is.

182
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,625
So, what's the deal
with your apartment?

183
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,226
Why's it taking so long?

184
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:03,296
Um, it was a drywall problem.

185
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:06,766
Oh, no, what happened?

186
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:11,671
Well, the drywall got wet,
and you do not want wet drywall

187
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:15,775
because when drywall gets
wet, it's really more...

188
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,611
Wet wall?

189
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:22,415
Or damp wall, just as bad.
Mm.

190
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,652
So why don't they
just get more drywall?

191
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,388
Well, they went to get some,

192
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,692
but the woman at the wall store

193
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:34,360
said it was going on sale
and they should wait

194
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:37,330
because the savings...
Okay, are you done?

195
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,065
Bernadette told me
your apartment's ready.

196
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:43,036
I was done at wet wall,
but you wouldn't let it go.

197
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,905
But is Sheldon really
believing all this crap?

198
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,675
Well, he started to question it,
but then I fake sneezed on him

199
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,678
and he ran to take a shower.

200
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,447
Please don't say anything,
I feel terrible about this.

201
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,648
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

202
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,816
Thanks.

203
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:02,155
"The woman at the wall store?"
Let it go!

204
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,092
Are you going to confront Penny?

205
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,660
Eventually, I guess.

206
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:10,063
Although, I am kind of curious
how long she thinks

207
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,131
she can keep hiding my stuff
without me knowing.

208
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,833
Hmm.

209
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:17,003
You know, perhaps
instead of confronting them,

210
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,905
we should see how far
they're willing to spin

211
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,440
their tangled webs.

212
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,041
Like that
Spider-Man action figure

213
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,711
that used to be on your desk.

214
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:27,580
Oh, my God, I'm going blind.

215
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,483
Hi.
Food's here.

216
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,285
Oh.

217
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,152
Excellent.

218
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,621
I'm very hungry.

219
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:36,689
Yeah, speaking of which,

220
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,591
what's going on
with your apartment?

221
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:42,328
Oh, uh, they're still
working on it.

222
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,529
Interesting.

223
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,099
Very interesting.

224
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,802
Yeah, we swung by her apartment
on the way to the restaurant,

225
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:51,104
and they're gonna be fixing it
for a while.

226
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:54,941
Wait, uh...
you saw her apartment?

227
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,310
I did, still a mess.

228
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,282
Leonard?
Yeah?

229
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:18,798
W-Why are you
speaking Klingon?

230
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,901
Why are you speaking English?

231
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:24,036
This is ridiculous.

232
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:25,404
Penny, do you remember

233
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,539
when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?

234
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,708
(speaks Ubbi Dubbi)

235
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,113
(speaking Ubbi Dubbi)

236
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,825
Oh, wait, stop that.

237
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:46,959
You stop that.

238
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,128
(speaks Klingon)

239
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,030
(speaks Klingon)

240
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,265
PENNY: Okay.

241
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,900
That's enough.
You know what?

242
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,068
What is going on?

243
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,070
Fine, I told
Sheldon that

244
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,238
her apartment's
been finished,

245
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,640
but then you just said it's not,

246
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:01,507
so now I'm all confused.

247
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,510
Penny was just
covering for me.

248
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,546
My place has been
ready for two weeks.

249
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,247
How could you lie to me?

250
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,315
Uh, she's enjoyed
living with you.

251
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,616
It's called being in love.

252
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,185
Mm-hmm, and
what's it called

253
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:13,286
when you
secretly get rid

254
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,720
of all your
husband's stuff?

255
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,856
Wha... That is not true!

256
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,658
Wh-wh-wh... Bernadette
told Howard, Howard told me.

257
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,060
Plus, I can see
all my stuff is gone!

258
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,163
Oh, so, you believe your friend,
and your friend's wife

259
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,132
and your own eyes over me?

260
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,429
Wow.

261
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,447
You really didn't
think I'd notice

262
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,748
my stuff was missing?

263
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,817
Uh, did you notice
your key chain?

264
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,324
Where's Batman?!

265
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,160
Hey.

266
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,161
Why did you tell Howard

267
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,395
I was hiding
Leonard's things?

268
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,129
One sec.

269
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,164
Why did you tell Leonard

270
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,299
I told you Penny was
hiding his things?!

271
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,301
It just came up

272
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,804
because we-we were talking
about secrets and...

273
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,138
Wait.

274
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,473
(speaks Klingon)

275
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:09,542
Everybody
stop it with that!

276
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,178
I'm not really a part of this,

277
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,447
so I'm just gonna dig in.

278
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,716
And I'd like to know
why you blabbed

279
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,217
about my apartment.

280
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,585
You're up, blabby.

281
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:23,623
Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

282
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,525
I guess it's okay.

283
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,261
I'm sorry

284
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:30,596
that I lied about
my apartment.

285
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,565
It's all right.

286
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,833
And...

287
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:34,800
And what?

288
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,702
Your wizard robes
are next to go.

289
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,640
Now that everything's
out on the table,

290
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,509
you-you think you two
will keep living together?

291
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,846
Despite recent events,

292
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,614
I do consider our experiment

293
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,150
in cohabitation
to have been positive.

294
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,086
Are you saying you'd like
to live with me?

295
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,722
I'm open to the possibility.

296
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:57,957
(gasps)

297
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,759
(speaks Ubbi Dubbi)

298
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,761
Whatever.

299
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,033
You know, if he moves
across the hall for good,

300
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,234
Leonard could keep the
stuff you don't like

301
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,335
in Sheldon's old room.

302
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:10,803
Solves everything.
That's a great idea!

303
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,472
Ooh, maybe I could turn it
into a gaming den.

304
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,373
That would be amazing.

305
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,441
Wait, wait,
hold on, do what?

306
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,777
Excuse me...
that's my room.

307
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,078
But you won't be living here.

308
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,513
But that's my room.

309
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,048
But you won't be living here.
But that's my room.

310
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,316
You guys might want
to start eating.

311
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,750
But you won't be living here.

312
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,286
Sweetie,
once you stop paying rent,

313
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,888
none of this is really yours.

314
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,022
But that's my room.

315
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,258
ALL:
But you won't be living here!

316
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:37,263
Thank you
for understanding.

317
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,898
Hey, I get it.

318
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,734
Everybody wants to spend
more time with me.

319
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,705
I'm like a man made of sugar
in a world of ants.

320
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,007
Good night.

321
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,142
Mm, night.
(smooches)

322
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,056
If we did continue
living together,

323
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,591
would it be here?

324
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,427
I don't know.

325
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,529
It-It could be.

326
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:11,464
Of course there's...

327
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,999
there's always
your apartment.

328
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,236
S-Sure, sure, we-we could
live in my apartment.

329
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:19,638
I hate your apartment.

330
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,142
Sorry, you brought it up?

331
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,479
Well, I suppose we could
find a whole new place.

332
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,680
You know, and, technically,

333
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,348
we don't even have to stay
in Pasadena.

334
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,251
We could, we could move
to Altadena...

335
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:35,221
or a place that doesn't
even end in "Dena."

336
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,956
It's kind of exciting.

337
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,992
I mean... we could do
whatever we want.

338
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,094
But what if we move

339
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,896
and we don't like it?

340
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,865
What if there's a smoker
in the building?

341
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:46,966
Or pets?

342
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,502
Or there could be mold.

343
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,170
- There could be traffic noise.
- (humming "Theme from <i>Star Trek")</i>

344
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:54,006
I'm gonna have to learn
a whole new bus route.

345
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,041
(humming "Theme
from <i>Star Trek")</i>

346
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,112
(stops humming)

347
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,014
Are you trying to soothe me

348
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,650
by singing the <i>Star Trek</i>
theme as a lullaby?

349
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,652
Yes.

350
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,255
I'm not a child,
don't do that.

351
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:10,990
Sorry.

352
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:18,164
Do you know <i>2001:</i>
<i>A Space Odyssey?</i>

353
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,167
(humming "Also
sprach Zarathustra")

354
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,810
All right, now
that's soothing.

355
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,380
(continues humming
"Also sprach Zarathustra")

356
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,788
Look, I-I get it,
this is still my room;

357
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,490
we haven't really
made it yours.

358
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:45,724
Thank you.

359
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,460
Which is why I got you

360
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:50,262
this Pink Power Ranger.

361
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,132
Put it anywhere you like.

362
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:56,435
Okay, but you may feel
some discomfort.

363
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:00,239
I'm kidding,
I want you to feel at home here.

364
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,408
Decorate it any way
that makes you happy.

365
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,909
Do you really mean that?

366
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:04,877
I really do.

367
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,312
Great, and just so you know,

368
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,913
I'm not getting rid
of all your stuff.

369
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:09,248
Yeah? What are you keeping?

370
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,816
That candle

371
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,284
and you.

372
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,387
What about my robot poster?

373
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,355
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

374
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,424
I can make do
with just the candle.

375
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:27,399
What's going on?

376
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:30,569
I'm struggling with the thought
of leaving my old bedroom.

377
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,273
Can it be more
of an internal struggle?

378
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,243
I need to see it.

379
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,246
While I'm gone,

380
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,948
don't breathe on my pillow.

381
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,884
How about if I just don't
breathe at all?

382
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:46,919
That's my girl.

383
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,589
(dance music playing)

384
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:55,728
What on earth?

385
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,443
What is going on?!

386
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,112
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

387
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,047
We turned your room

388
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,515
into a sex dungeon.

389
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,084
Oh!

390
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,020
No!

391
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,588
What is happening?!

392
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,127
Okay, last question.

393
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,629
The chaps he was wearing...
assless?

394
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Can we just focus on
the decision I'm facing?

395
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,936
We can, but for the record,

396
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,471
all chaps are assless.

397
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,107
Gentlemen, please,

398
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,976
this is a
significant decision.

399
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:47,046
Now, do Amy and I
continue living together?

400
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,248
Or do I move back in
with Leonard?

401
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,517
Over my assless chaps you will.

402
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,954
This isn't complicated.

403
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:56,522
Do you love Amy?

404
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,556
Yes.

405
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,058
Do you like living with her?

406
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,125
Yes.

407
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,528
Do you know what
you need to do now?

408
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,964
Apparently,
figure this out on my own

409
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,699
'cause you guys
are no help at all.

410
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,053
Hi.

411
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,355
Hello.

412
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,223
What are you doing?

413
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:36,161
I'm just contemplating
Buridan's donkey.

414
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,429
I understand.

415
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,597
I'll leave you be.

416
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,669
What, you're familiar
with the reference?

417
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:44,970
Of course.

418
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,939
Jean Buridan proposed

419
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,474
a philosophical thesis
stating that

420
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,876
a hungry donkey placed
between two equidistant

421
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,545
bales of hay would be
paralyzed by indecision

422
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,114
and would starve to death.

423
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,520
Exactly.

424
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,257
Well, I wouldn't want you
to starve to death, so...

425
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,594
...here's an eggplant.

426
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,797
Thank you.

427
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,367
You know, some people
believe that Buridan

428
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,969
was plagiarizing Aristotle.

429
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,504
Really?

430
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,538
Although,

431
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,806
in Aristotle's example,

432
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,642
he proposed an equally
hungry and thirsty man

433
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,077
caught between food and drink.

434
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,812
Huh.

435
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,080
Yeah, I wonder if that's related

436
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,416
to the 12th century
Persian philosopher,

437
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,316
Al-Ghazali

438
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,885
and his story of a man

439
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,586
caught between two dates.

440
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:37,489
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali
was Aristotelian?

441
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:40,626
'Cause if anything,
he was anti-Aristotelian.

442
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:45,197
Al-Ghazali was
anti-Aristotelian?

443
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:47,066
Boy, you think you know a guy.

444
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,038
Okay.

445
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,975
Open your eyes and
see your new room.

446
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,214
Wow.

447
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:09,750
I-I know I went
a little overboard.

448
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:10,985
We can always
dial it back.

449
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,119
No, no, no, no, no,

450
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,020
it's-it's important to me

451
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:14,755
that you have
the bedroom you want.

452
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,557
Oh, that means so
much. I love you.

453
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,125
I love you, too.

454
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:19,827
(smooches)

455
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,731
Just hiding some stuff in
your closet, don't tell Penny.

456
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:33,566
