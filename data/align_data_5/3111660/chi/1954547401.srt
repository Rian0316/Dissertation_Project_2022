00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,500
Sheldon, it's not a great time! What do you want?

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,730
Hello to you, too.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,550
I'm sorry, but this is important.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,340
What is it?

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,970
<i>Back to the Future II was</i> <i>in the Back to the Future llI case...</i>

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,350
<i>and Back to the Future llI was- get this-</i>

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,630
<i>in the Back to the Future II case.</i>

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,520
So?

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,050
So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,320
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,300
It's getting rough out here.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,810
You're dodging the question; I knew it was you.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,410
What was that? What was what?

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,900
This isn't a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,820
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,940
You know there's no such thing as a...

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,450
No...!

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,990
Penny... Penny...Penny...!

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,790
What's the matter?

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,200
Um... well, I was worried

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,470
that you might be missing Leonard.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,190
And that might be causing you to have bad dreams,

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,570
<i>like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans</i>

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,300
right before you went to bed.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,670
<i>Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?</i>

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,390
To be honest, I did.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,190
<i>Back to the Future II was</i> <i>in the Back to the Future llI case.</i>

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,750
Leonard did it.

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,720
Good night. No, wait.

30
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,770
Perhaps I should sleep here so you don't miss Leonard as much,

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,130
uh, 'cause you're being kind of a baby about it.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,620
You know what? That would make me feel better.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Thank you. You're welcome.

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,400
Good night.

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,320
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state * 

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,330
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait* 

37
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,410
* The Earth began to cool

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,370
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools * 

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,500
* We built the Wall â™i>We built the pyramii> * /i>

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,260
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery * 

41
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,320
* That all started with a big bang * 

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,190
<i>* Bang> * /i>

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,190

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,190

45
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,840
·­Òë£ºID
Ð£¶Ô£ºID

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,320
I think you'd be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage,

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,930
I saw this oil stain on the ground

48
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,560
that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,380
and I didn't get upset at all. I'm proud of you.

50
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,180
Well, you should be, 'cause she was looking good.

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,150
Dear Lord! You're an astronomer.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,590
Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,200
Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Is that true? Everything I say is true.

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,070
Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys

56
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,750
eating feces, living in feces and making little balls out of feces.

57
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,180
So pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,000
you want to embrace.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,030
Come on, you can talk to girls now.

60
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,290
It shouldn't be hard for you to meet someone new.

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,110
How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy's face?

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,740
Tell me you don't see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,230
Oh, will you stop it!

64
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,620
Now, listen to me. There's a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight.

65
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,110
Go to it and meet someone who isn't made of grease or pie.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,180
You think you're so cool because your wife is a person?

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,250
Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience conference with Amy-

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,350
I'll go with you.

69
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,690
You would do that for me? Of course.

70
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,060
You're my friend. I want you to be happy.

71
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,960
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town, would you like to join us?

72
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,120
I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,900
Howie, stop. I can't talk like that.

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,780
Amy's right here.

75
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,690
Sheldon, stop. For the last time,

76
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,130
I will not bring home bed bugs.

77
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,030
The hotel's nice.

78
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,460
There's a pool, a gym- the bar looks like fun.

79
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,600
Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.

80
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,870
Aw, I love you, too. If I don't talk to you before you go to sleep,

81
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll meet you in dreamland.

82
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,520
Good night.

83
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,990
No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.

84
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,790
Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains...

85
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,170
No.

86
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,040
Well, now that I've piqued your interest,

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,350
welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.

88
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,050
Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,950
because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?

90
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,800
You overestimate his significance in my life.

91
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,200
Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup?

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,660
No.

93
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,100
Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck?

94
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,960
I don't think so. Do I miss how we say "good night"

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,980
to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?

96
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,770
Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.

97
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,540
Well, I try.

98
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,900
All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.

99
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,770
Great. I'll go first. Okay.

100
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,930
By the way, how are you with zippers? Why?

101
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
Well, I really need to go to the bathroom,

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,720
and this one's gone all cattywampus.

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,620
Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.

104
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,610
It is.

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,310
You can download my paper off the university server.

106
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,700
I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.

107
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,570
I will.

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,520
All right.

109
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,110
How'd it go? Well, if you like dry, factual statements

110
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,340
interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.

111
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,920
Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,110
She's probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.

113
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,210
Oh, great.

114
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,050
There go my chances of being sexually harassed.

115
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,990
I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.

116
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,610
That's so much better than the old, ugly ones.

117
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,080
Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,920
Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.

119
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,340
You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.

120
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,430
Okay.

121
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,010
So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember,

122
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,230
penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,190
It was better when you couldn't talk to women.

124
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,740
I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions

125
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,170
in the formation of autobiographical memory. Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.

126
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,440
Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.

127
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,060
To the advancement of science.

128
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,820
And to the sick and dying who make it possible.

129
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,950
This is fun; we never really get to talk shop with Penny around.

130
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,080
We usually just end up talking about boys.

131
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,690
Which is fine, but it's nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.

132
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,700
From the two gentlemen at the bar.

133
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks! Boys bought us drinks!

134
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,070
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

135
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,340
Be cool. You be cool!

136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,220
Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.

137
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,820
You're right.

138
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,630
Thank you.

139
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,770
Ooh! Bad move.

140
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,520
Really? Why?

141
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,640
My queen can now take your rook from below.

142
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,590
So that means I lose, right? It's over!

143
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,320
If I make this move...

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,400
but I won't because we're having too much fun.

145
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,970
Okay, let's take a break.

146
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,090
We're all out of alcohol.

147
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,650
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

148
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,010
Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now.

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,930
I miss him so much.

150
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,030
Well, if you'd like, we could call him.

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,900
I- I mean that you could call him.

152
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,720
As I've explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain.

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,650
As rock and roll bad boy, Paul Simon, once said, "I am a rock.

154
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,370
I am an i-i-i-island. "

155
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,980
I'm calling him. Oh, goodie! Put him on speakerphone!

156
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,590
Excuse me, ladies, but my pants are buzzing.

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,490
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

158
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,240
Leonard?

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,120
Penny? Hey, it's Penny.

160
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,930
Everybody say hi to Penny. Hi, Penny!

161
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,890
Wow, it sounds like you're having a good time.

162
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,310
Best time of my life!

163
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,760
Isn't it 5:30 in the morning there?

164
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,630
Is it?

165
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,210
Hey, everybody, it's 5:30 in the morning!

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,080
okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.

167
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,160
Iceberg! Uh-oh, hang on.

168
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,870
Are you in danger? No, it's a drinking game.

169
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,850
Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!

170
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,130
Berg! Berg!

171
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,240
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg-

172
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,860
Leonard, Leonard?

173
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,390
I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,550
<i>You were.</i> 

175
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,450
So what happened? How'd it go?

176
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,790
It's fine. I thanked them again and let them know we're not available.

177
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,090
So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?

178
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,570
Yes, it's all cool.

179
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,500
Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.

180
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,070
And why would no one blame me?

181
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,160
I don't know what I'm saying.

182
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,650
Well, it sounds like you're saying that I could do better than Sheldon.

183
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,610
Boy, these drinks are strong!

184
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,650
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu ??? tonight!

185
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,070
No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.

186
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,350
I just meant that you're not married and your boyfriend's kind of...

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,740
Sheldon.

188
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,570
And your husband is extremely Howard.

189
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,140
What's your point?

190
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,690
Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say.

191
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,120
Can we please just go back to having a nice time?

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,180
We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free

193
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,700
and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.

194
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,280
Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?

195
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,690
Sure. Thanks.

196
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,030
Your husband's weird and his clothes are ridiculous.

197
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,920
I can't believe it!

198
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,950
All this time I've been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy.

199
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,440
And you know what the worst part is?

200
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,500
That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka?

201
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,090
No.

202
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,580
Yes.

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,410
But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.

204
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,900
Allow me to comfort you.

205
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,380
At least you've got your health.

206
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,390
Really? Tha-That's it? That's comforting?

207
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,060
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

208
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,770
you'll both be dead and it won't matter?

209
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,450
No! Come on!

210
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,950
You're supposed to say, "Of course he misses you.

211
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,420
The only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain. "

212
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,710
Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.

213
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,670
This is ridiculous.

214
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,500
Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?

215
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,870
Well... perhaps you're obsessively picturing him

216
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,030
engaged in drunken coitus with another woman.

217
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,870
Is that it? Did I get it right?

218
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,970
Okay, tha-that's great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.

219
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,620
Actually, I can't. Before Leonard left,

220
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,180
he made me promise that I'd take care of you.

221
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,420
He did? Yes.

222
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,650
Oh, that's really sweet.

223
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,610
Plus, if I do a good job, he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.

224
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Now I miss him even more.

225
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,120
Well, if it's any consolation,  I'm sure 

226
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,880
Leonard's tormented every moment he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.

227
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,490
Thanks. Oh, seriously?

228
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,960
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

229
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,370
What?

230
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,500
I'd like to apologize for being insensitive.

231
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,390
And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks,

232
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,450
'cause 99% of them are stand-up guys.

233
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,770
Forget about it.

234
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,710
You know, you-you and I, you and I have a lot in common. Is that right?

235
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,230
Oh, yes, I-I, too,
am in the throes of heartbreak.

236
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,820
Okay, fine, I'll tell you about it.

237
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,650
Here is a hot beverage to comfort you.

238
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,340
It's in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.

239
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,690
Come on. It's still early. Let's do something.

240
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,090
Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4-D chess.

241
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,940
How about we just talk? All right.

242
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,410
In 4-D chess... No.

243
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Come on, let's talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don't know.

244
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,520
I own nine pairs of pants.

245
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,820
Okay, that-that's a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.

246
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,750
I see. Hmm.

247
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,040
I own nine pairs of underpants.

248
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,830
How about I go first?

249
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,380
But I don't want to know how many underpants you own.

250
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,150
Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.

251
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,270
Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me.

252
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,600
When I first moved out to L.A.,

253
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,140
I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla.

254
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,360
Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,610
Thankfully, that thing never came out.

256
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,300
I've seen that.

257
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,350
<i>Yeah. Serial Apeist.</i>

258
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,380
Howard found it online the day we met you.

259
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,750
Oh, God...

260
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,640
And it was literally the moment you walked out the door.

261
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,900
But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for.

262
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,700
Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.

263
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,690
Okay.

264
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,170
A while back,

265
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,930
YouTube changed its user interface

266
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,670
from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system.

267
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,990
I tell people I'm okay with it, but I'm really not.

268
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,600
That's your big revelation?

269
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,080
Yes.

270
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,630
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter. Okay, you know what?

271
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,660
I give up. I'm going to bed.

272
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,680
Here's something else you don't know about me:

273
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,060
you just hurt my feelings. What did I do?

274
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,280
I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me,

275
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,760
and you treated it as if it were nothing.

276
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,410
I- I didn't think it was a big deal.

277
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,980
It is to me; that's the point.

278
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,220
Sheldon, you are right. I'm really sorry.

279
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,700
I should've known better. Your apology is accepted.

280
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,660
Thank you. How about a hug?

281
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,630
How about a hearty handshake?

282
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,040
Come on.

283
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,180
Now I know how you felt getting mauled

284
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,420
by that sex-crazed gorilla.

285
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,450
Good night.

286
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,380
It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.

287
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,490
Yeah, that felt nice.

288
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,340
Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants

289
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,880
and see if we can score us some free omelets.

290
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,770
So, hypothetically, if-if we were to have gone with them,

291
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,760
which one would you have picked?

292
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,650
I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.

293
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,610
Oh, good, 'cause I liked the tall thin one.

294
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,120
He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced,

295
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,450
like I'd have to teach him a thing or two.

296
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,900
Not my guy.

297
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,040
I caught him staring at my rack.

298
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,370
It'd be nice to be with a man who wants to know what's underneath my cardigan.

299
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,870
FYI, it's another cardigan.

300
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,290
Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.

301
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,450
Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.

302
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,920
Good night. Night.

303
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,050
All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it's been nice talking to you,

304
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,340
but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.

305
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,430
Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent.

306
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,280
I have a dog. Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.

307
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,560
Good night.

308
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,060
Mrs. Davis...

309
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,980
I, uh, I must confess,

310
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,360
I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc,

311
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,090
but instead I got to connect with you at a human level.

312
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,480
That's a much better evening.

313
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,810
You're a lovely person.

314
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,070
Are you hitting on me? No, no, no, that would be crazy!

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,620
I mean, if I were hitting on you, you'd know it

316
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,730
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.

317
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,260
You're sweet.

318
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,960
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

319
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,500
Good night.

320
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,860
Looks like she accepted your apology.

321
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,440
And then some. I think we had a moment.

322
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,120
Oh, please, you did not have a moment.

323
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,400
Who died and made you king of moments?

324
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,200
Okay, fine. Let's say there was a moment.

325
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,550
There was. There wasn't.

326
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,810
But... But even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?

327
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,370
I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed,

328
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,290
hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.

329
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,360
So nothing. No, not a thing.

330
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm so glad the police finally caught

331
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,190
that psychotic genetically engineered ape.

332
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,640
That is my girlfriend! I swear to God!

333
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,290
Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!

334
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,130
