Look, maybe you better drive. Do you drive?

171
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,220
我剛剛喝過酒

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,770
在城外的某條路上  靠近高威科姆鎮
It's a street somewhere out of town. Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

他們讓我們在兩點前趕到  時間很緊
They said we got to be there by two. It's gonna be tight.

181

他們一定掌握了你的什么把柄吧
So I'm guessing they got some shit on you

182
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,900
威脅要公布出去吧

至于我  是...
With me, it's...

190
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,570
我沒辦法為自己找個正當理由
I can't fucking justify it.

191
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,340
我就是想操個20多歲的年輕姑娘
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

192
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,250
為了紀念過去吧  我也說不清

我登陸了一個網站  我很好奇
I joined this website. I was curious.

195
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,580
我跟明迪聊上了  至少我以為她叫明迪
I got talking to Mindy, who I thought was Mindy.

196
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,330
她給我發了些照片  我也回復了一些
I mean, she sent me pictures. I sent some back.

197
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,890
手機自拍照  握住我自己的雞巴
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

198
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,450
你能想到的都有  他們全掌握了

我在那兒討價還價  他們說他們全都掌握了
Me haggling over the price and they say they got it all.

202
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,240
像審計員一樣  把硬盤的信息全抽干了
Sucked up the whole hard drive like an audit.

203
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,270
該死的混蛋  我真是個大白癡
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

204
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,900
如果那些信息泄露出去  我妻子就會離我而去
If that shit gets out, that's my wife out the door.

205
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,840
她還會把孩子們也都帶走
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

206
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,940
我毫不懷疑  她會帶走他們
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind she'd take them

207
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,800
而且她會打贏官司
and she'd win.

208
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,430
她會獲得監護權
Custody, she'd win.

209
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,490
我跟你說  我絕不能失去我的孩子們
And I'm not losing my kids. I tell you that right now.
