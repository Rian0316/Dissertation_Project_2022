1
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,470
No, seriously,

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,750
I think I've finally figured out my problem with women.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,540
The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,880
What does that have to do with me and women?

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,290
Nothing. It was a desperate attempt

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,140
to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,460
My problem is, I don't project confidence.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,080
So I decided the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,320
rather than holding back and being cautious,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,690
Oh, yeah? What's that look like?

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,550
Hi.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,390
I'm Leonard.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,950
And you are beautiful.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,610
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,290
I'm going to pick you up at 8:00,

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,080
show you a night you will never forget.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,140
Where are we going?

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,180
Good news.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,050
I made it onto the team for the new Defense Department

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,990
laser-equipped surveillance satellite.

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,320
Excuse me.

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,580
If we're changing topics, I believe I have first dibs

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,590
with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,410
Congratulations, Howard.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,230
Thanks.

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,580
Listen, I have to get a security clearance,

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,340
so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,900
I don't want to speak to the FBI.

31
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,610
Why not?

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm brown and I talk funny.

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,570
They're just doing a background check on me.

34
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,060
It doesn't matter, they'll find a reason

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,000
to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville.

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,600
By the way, when I say that, it's not offensive.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,930
Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,950
You're here legally.

39
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,620
Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been

40
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,990
since I got through airport security

41
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,750
without being given a colonoscopy?

42
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
You know, I try very hard

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,460
to make our lunch hours educational and informative,

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,400
but your insistence on talking about your own lives

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,780
stymies me at every turn.

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,120
Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.

47
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,280
No, you squandered your time with me,

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
and the moment has now passed.

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,910
Feast on your disappointment,

50
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,040
much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,700

52
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,700
Oh, Bella, don't you see?

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,830
Edward's only pushing you away because he loves you.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,270
Coming.

55
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,870
Dr. Koothrappali?

56
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,550
May I come in?

58
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,660
I'd like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz.

59
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,320
Oh, thank you.

60
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,120
All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?

61
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,030
Rum cake?

62
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,270
No, thanks.

63
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,240
Now, about Mr. Wolowitz...

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,670
Seven years.

65
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,150
I see.

66
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,510
I'm in this country legally, you know.

67
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm sure you are.

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,330
Now, to your knowledge,

69
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,700
has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,650
Of course not.

71
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,230
I'm here on an H-1B visa,

72
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,230

73
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,250
which means I can't be associated in any way

74
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,350
with crime or criminal activity and I'm not.

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,780
Good.

76
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,150
To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz

77
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,690
have any foreign contacts?

78
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,640
No, just me.

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,770
Oh, there it is.

80
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,420
Here comes a cavity search.

81
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,130
Excuse me?

82
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,280
Please don't send me back to India, it's so crowded!

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,940
It's like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con,

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,630
except everybody's wearing the same costume:

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,310
Indian Guy.

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,510
- Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not... - I love this country!

87
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,360
The-the baseball, the freedom,

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,470
the rampant morbid obesity!

89
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,990
From California to the New York Island!

90
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,400
I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!

91
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,400

92
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
Dr. Koothrappali, please.

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,110
My country 'tis of thee... ?

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,110

95
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,120
...liberty

96
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,160
It's really great.

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,160

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,250
So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me,

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,920
I was expecting Mulder.

100
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,110
Glad to see I got Scully.

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,110

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,130
Who?

103
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,900
Mulder and Scully.

104
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,090
X-Files.

105
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,980
"The truth is out there." never mind.

106
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,030
Uh, so, what would you like to know?

107
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,920
You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,190
Yes. Of course, we're in different departments.

109
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,230
He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist.

110
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,360
You know, one of those guys

111
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
who examines the building blocks of creation

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,630
and says, "Hello, maker of the universe.

113
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,120
"I see what you did there.

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Good one."

115
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,380
Right.

116
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,700
Now, how would you characterize

117
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,500
your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
Good.

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,660
It's a good relationship.

120
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,590
Of course, most of my relationships are good.

121
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,170
Probably because I exude confidence.

122
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,710
People are drawn to that, you know?

123
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,450
Confidence, not exuding.

124
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,890
Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

125
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,030
You are beautiful, you know that?

126
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,630
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

127
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,550
I'm going to pick you up at 8:00,

128
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,590
show you a night you will never forget.

129
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,480
Sounds great.

130
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
Really?

131
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,090
Can my six-foot-two

132
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,870
Navy seal husband come with us?

133
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,460
Is that...?

134
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,070
Oh, my, I didn't see the ring with my glasses off, so...

135
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,120
Look at that, I'm starting to exude.

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,020
Want to get that?

137
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,760
Not particularly.

138
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,630
Could you get that?

139
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,390
I suppose I could if I were asked.

140
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,860
Would you please get that?

141
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
Of course.

142
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,020
Why do you have to make things so complicated?

143
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,680
Dr. Cooper?

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,460
Yes.

145
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

146
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,750
You say you're

147
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,440
Special Agent Page, FBI.

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,290
Here's my I.D.

149
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,690
And here is my Justice League membership card.

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,940
But that doesn't prove I know Batman.

151
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,570
I just want to ask you a few questions

152
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,520
about Howard Wolowitz.

153
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
Oh. All right.

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,790
I doubt anyone would risk

155
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,700
the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,880
just to ask questions about a minor league engineer

157
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,540
with an unresolved oedipal complex.

158
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,730
Thank you.

159
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,940
For the record, I truly support the FBI

160
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,730
in the mission which is expressed

161
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,330
through their motto...?

162
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,660
Fidelity, bravery, and integrity.

163
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,540
Correct. Now to business.

164
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,690
18 years ago, I sent the FBI crime lab samples

165
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,130
from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire

166
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,480
on my front porch...

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,180
...for fingerprinting and DNA analysis.

168
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,580
Why haven't I heard back yet?

169
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,660
Well, the FBI crime lab does have a lot on its plate.

170
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,410
That's of little comfort to a nation

171
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,210
attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.

172
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,660
Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,020
A little, but go on.

174
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,170
Thank you.

175
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,510
Would you characterize him as responsible?

176
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,020
I'm going to answer that with a visual aid.

177
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,580
This is my nine-disc complete

178
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,950
Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.

179
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,280
Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

180
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,090
damaged plastic retention hub number three...

181
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,140
...and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice.

182
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,930
Would you characterize that as responsible?

183
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,560
That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,430
You heard me say blu-ray, right?

185
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,310
I did.

186
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,310
Very well.

187
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,750
Would you be interested

188
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,220
in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto

189
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,180
my World of Warcraft account and changed the name

190
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,060
of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?

191
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,030
I'm afraid not.

192
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,710
Is there anything else?

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,740
"Is there anything else"?

194
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,020
Where would you like to start?

195
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,760
He refuses to pay fines

196
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
when he's overdue with books I lend him.

197
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,190
He crashed the Mars Rover

198
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,930
while attempting to impress a woman.

199
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,360
He recommended that I go see

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,070
the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote,

201
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,950
"just as good as the first one".

202
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,130
If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.

203
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,450
The Mars Rover?

204
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,530
Did I say Mars Rover?

205
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,990
You did.

206
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,640
That was actually a poorly chosen example,

207
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,320
as it had nothing to do with me.

208
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,920
Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.

209
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,830
I don't want to.

210
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,780
Not that my disinclination

211
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,160
to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,290
Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction

213
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,410
of government property worth millions of dollars.

214
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,840
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

215
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
I think I have all I need.

216
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,310
Oh, good.

217
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,910
I was afraid you were going to fixate

218
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,100
on that Mars Rover incident.

219
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,490
Hey, buddies.

220
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,070
Guess who didn't get security clearance

221
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,010
to work on the giant space laser?

222
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,830
What happened?

223
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,120
Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well.

224
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,710
You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

225
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,770
Well, actually, I may have gotten

226
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,210
a little tipsy when I talked to her.

227
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,590
And I may have hit on her a little bit.

228
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,090
I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.

229
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,720
I see.

230
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,050
Well, it's good to know, when I need you guys,

231
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,850
I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.

232
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,410
I feel awful.

233
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,850
Ah, me, too.

234
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,450
To tell you the truth,

235
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,350
I thought if anyone was going to

236
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,430
screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.

237
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,530
Well, your expectations have been subverted.

238
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,570
Aha.

239
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,700
What are you doing up?

240
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,680
Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,130
Really?

242
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,750
Maybe sleep has met you before.

243
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,260
Mockery?

244
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,890
That's all you have to offer?

245
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,440
I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,610
Who knows?

247
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,360
I haven't watched any scary movies recently.

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,880
I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass

249
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,930
of the quantum vacuum has little effect

250
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,850
on the expansion of the universe.

251
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,300
And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,230
Did something happen today that's bothering you?

253
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,180
Well, I did mention

254
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,100
the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent

255
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,730
and probably cost Howard his security clearance.

256
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,310
- What? - But why should that keep me up?

257
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,610
Because you feel guilty?

258
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,270
Interesting.

259
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,560
So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.

260
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,410
Actually, you don't have insomnia.

261
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,640
You're sleeping now.

262
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,840
Excuse me?

263
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,770
You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

264
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,560
Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?

265
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,250
How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?

266
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,030
That seems fairly conclusive.

267
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,280
No, Gorn, no.

268
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,600
That's where I sit.

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,660
Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.

270
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,490
Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

271
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,880
I understand you want to recant

272
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,930
your statement about Howard Wolowitz.

273
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,220
- Yes. - Was your statement untrue?

274
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,650
No.

275
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,570
Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.

276
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying "No backsies."

277
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,330
Is there anything else?

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,310
Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement

279
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,620
about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe

280
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,160
will tip the scales back in his favor.

281
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,090
"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

282
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,500
"H is for honesty, of which he has much.

283
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,120
"O's for outstanding,

284
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,380
"Which he is such.

285
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,040
"W's for witty, he's quick with a joke.

286
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,170
- A's for artistic, his ability..." - I'm sorry.

287
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,180
Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.

288
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,610
But I still have "rd Joel Wolowitz" Left to go.

289
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,470
It's closed.

290
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,150
I don't understand why you people

291
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,660
are picking on my friend, Howard,

292
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,240
when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.

293
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,340
For instance, when I first met Leonard,

294
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,700
he was on the verge of giving away

295
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,850
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy,

296
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,020
and not one agent ever investigated that.

297
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,030
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

298
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,090
No, it's a different Leonard.

299
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,420
He's...

300
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,040
Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.

301
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,010
Raj.

302
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,470
Have you seen Howard?

303
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,310
I think he's eating lunch.

304
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,970
Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil DeGrasse Tyson

305
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,120
from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.

306
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

307
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,690
He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto

308
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,370
from planetary status.

309
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,960
I liked Pluto.

310
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,310
Ergo I do not like you.

311
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,360
But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

312
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,030
That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.

313
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,190
If "Ifs" And "Buts" Were candy and nuts,

314
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,680
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

315
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,970
Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

316
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,990
Is that the guy you were telling me about?

317
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,990
Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,320
Howard.

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,830
The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.

320
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,700
You?

321
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,830
Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know

322
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.

323
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,430
And they were okay with that?

324
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,050
No. If anything, I made it worse.

325
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,440
In any case, I have been riddled with guilt,

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,070
which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep.

327
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,660
So, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.

328
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,610
Are you kidding me?

329
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,160
You've set my career back at least two years,

330
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,250
and you think you can make it right with "I'm sorry"?

331
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,910
Yes.

332
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,600
I followed the social protocol.

333
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,380
I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so,

334
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,100
I delivered a heartfelt apology.

335
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,150
Now you say,

336
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,280
"Apology accepted,"

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,030
and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.

338
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,990
Your apology is not accepted.

339
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,740
You're tricking me.

340
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,360
It really is, isn't it?

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,710
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

342
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,910
Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know

343
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,310
I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.

344
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, shut up.

345
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,970
Sheldon?

346
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,730
Hello.

347
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,540
What are you doing here?

348
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,980
I have troubles, Penny.

349
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,070
I've come to pour them out

350
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,980
to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.

351
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,350
You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.

352
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,710
I don't like the Olive Garden.

353
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,150
They treat me like family.

354
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,590
- Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?  - Alcohol.

355
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,410
Could you be a little more specific?

356
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,850
Ethyl alcohol.

357
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,750
40 milliliters.

358
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm sorry, honey. I don't know milliliters.

359
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,190
Ah. Blame President James "Jimmy" Carter.

360
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,790
He started America on a path to the metric system

361
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,640
but then just gave up.

362
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,230
He wonders why he was a one-term president.

363
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,100
Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?

364
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,160
- More or less.  - Great.

365
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,460
Now, where were we?

366
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,330
I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail.

367
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,680
Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics,

368
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,820
there's an app for that.

369
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,830
Let's see.

370
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,970
Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

371
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,270
Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so.

372
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,890
Rob Roy, silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

373
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,530
I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

374
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,220
- A what? - You'll need pitted,brandied cherries, gin,

375
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,850
rosewater, Angostura Bitters and overproofed rum.

376
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,330
Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar,

377
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,110
then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters.

378
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,490
Then ignite the rum, caramel...

379
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,510
Here you go -- one Rosewater Ricky.

380
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,600
That's not how it looks in the picture.

381
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,970
Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently.

382
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,760
Why don't you give it a try.

383
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,810
All right.

384
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
To the metric system.

385
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,170
I can't taste the cherries.

386
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,350
All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?

387
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,570
I wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.

388
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,730
Oh, right, that.

389
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,350
Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

390
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,060
Penny, you face failure on a daily basis.

391
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,440
How do you cope?

392
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
I drink.

393
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,640
To drinking.

394
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,990
Nope.

395
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,190
If only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology

396
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,130
so I could escape this miasma of guilt.

397
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,020
You know, sometimes stuff just happens,

398
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,550
and there's nothing you can do about it.

399
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,520
Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade,

400
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,300
because no matter how much you apologize,

401
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,400
you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

402
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,320
I see.

403
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,430
You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's

404
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,240
unwinnable command scenario: the Kobayashi Maru.

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,090
Exactly.

406
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,460
Sometimes you can't win.

407
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,620
Captain Kirk won.

408
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,870
Kirk cheated.

409
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,520
Impressive that you know that.

410
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
It's hard to believe i'm actually having this conversation with you.

411
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,890
Right there with you.

412
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,750
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator.

413
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,530
- That's it. - What?

414
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,290
- I'll reprogram Howard. - What...?

415
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,540
Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

416
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,120
No, you can't reprogram people.

417
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,240
To James Tiberius Kirk.

418
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,020
Hello, all.

419
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,990
Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?

420
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,720
Not really.

421
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,490
Yes, you are.

422
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm using neurolinguistic programming

423
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,030
to modify your thought patterns.

424
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,860
Go away, Sheldon.

425
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,550
There's a $9.95 e-book down the drain.

426
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,630
What's in the bag?

427
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,060
It's for Howard.

428
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,510
Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.

429
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,080
Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

430
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,810
and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.

431
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,530
You're giving me a couch cushion?

432
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,040
No.

433
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,810
The cushion is merely symbolic.

434
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,190
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

435
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,740
But you love that spot.

436
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,360
No. I love my mother.

437
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
My feelings for my spot are much greater.

438
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,190
It is the singular location in space

439
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,110
around which revolves my entire universe.

440
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,440
And now it's yours.

441
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,290
Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.

442
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,770
All right.

443
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,400
Apology accepted.

444
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
High five.

445
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,830
Not too hard.

446
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,890
Thank you.

447
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,610
I haven't cried like this since Toy Story 3.

448
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,020
I got to tell you, Sheldon,

449
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,220
I understand why you chose this spot.

450
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,280
I mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft.

451
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,570
I can see the television, but I can still talk to...

452
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,700
I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.

453
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,830
How long?

454
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,740
94 seconds.
