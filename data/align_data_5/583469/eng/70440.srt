1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,595
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,549
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,951
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,758
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,798
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,551
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,196
Pardon?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,358
Nothing. Just a little
extra air in my mouth.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,710
Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'll pay you back.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,593
Yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week...

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,273
...you now owe me...

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,756
...17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,158
Really, I'll pay you back this time.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,751
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,276
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,038
What kind of research?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,797
Just, you know, science.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,153
Science.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,036
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,078
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,958
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,154
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,635
I just go down there
every other day...

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,952
...and make my contribution
to the project.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,914
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,753
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,190
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,469
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.
Ripped by KoXo

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,315
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,599
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,759
Men are here!

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,753
We make fire.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,199
Cook meat.

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,273
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,714
Cute, cute!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,195
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,479
So how are things going?

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,234
Is she becoming your special someone?

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,959
I don't know.
She's pretty great.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,357
What does she think of
your little science project?

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,950
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,159
The man's got a point.

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,876
The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,951
Crazy bitch!

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,276
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules...

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,149
...to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments...

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,793
...if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,076
Joey, we always know what you mean.

49
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,557
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna last?

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,268
I'm going to China.

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,277
Jeez, you say one thing and...

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,235
You're going to China?

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,034
It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,196
They don't want us
to have the bone.

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,479
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,195
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,752
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,154
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,719
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,075
Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,038
I'm your father.

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,356
I am The Head!

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,152
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,035
Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I left.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,356
She's out having drinks with Carl.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,953
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,755
You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,993
-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,478
So you do know who he is.

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,591
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,268
You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,309
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

73
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,271
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,633
Do you guys know who Carl is?

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,071
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore...

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,955
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.

77
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,674
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,873
Forget about her.

79
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,959
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,868
Of course, there,
they just call it food.

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,797
I guess. I don't know.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,757
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,356
We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,275
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,511
I'm still on my first.

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,912
I just think you're nice.

87
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,589
That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

88
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,759
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers".

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,153
Like "The Three Musketeers",
only with fruit.

90
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,593
-How do you like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,789
Hold on there, tiger.

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,034
How are you holding up?

93
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,593
Well, not so good.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,190
She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight...

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,674
...if you know what I--

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,194
And you do!

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,877
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

98
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,753
What do you mean?

99
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
You know, just be there for her.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,153
Not following you.

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,159
Think about it.

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,951
I'm guessing this is from...

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,558
Well, thank you, Melanie.

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,956
This one right here is from me.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,559
It's light.

106
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,155
It rattles.

107
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,349
It's...

108
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,155
...Travel Scrabble!

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,355
Thank you.

110
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,788
This one's from Joey.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,513
It feels like a book.
I think it's a book.

112
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,111
And it's a book!

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,829
It's Dr. Seuss!

114
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,830
That book got me through
some tough times.

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,194
There is a little child
inside this man.

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,198
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

117
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,991
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross'.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,353
Oh, my God!

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,948
He remembered!

120
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,349
Remembered what?

121
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,988
It was months ago.

122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,556
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,271
I told him it was just like one
my grandmother had when I was little.

124
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,829
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,959
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,356
It's so pretty!

127
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,993
This must've cost him a fortune.

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,315
I can't believe he did this.

129
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,750
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,350
...and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,555
What did you say?

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,999
Crystal duck.

133
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,478
The "love" part?

134
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,552
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,270
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,351
That'll turn back time.

137
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,116
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

138
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,874
I know.
This is really, really huge!

139
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,398
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,395
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

141
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,228
Is there a mute button
on this woman?

142
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,671
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,194
Did you have any idea?

144
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,998
No, none!

145
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,277
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

146
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,954
...but nothing ever happened,
so I just...

147
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,158
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

148
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,192
Given that he's desperately
in love with you...

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,352
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

150
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,554
Ross?

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,792
All this time?

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,156
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,515
The country.

154
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,913
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

155
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,237
-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,474
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,749
What'll you say to him?

158
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,994
I don't know.

159
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,355
Then maybe you shouldn't go.

160
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,075
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,231
But if it's good news,
tell him now.

162
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,919
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

163
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,554
Here, look.
All right, does this help?

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,949
All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

165
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,549
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

166
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,994
I'll see you later.

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,076
I love you!

168
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,753
Deal with me first!

169
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,676
All right.

170
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,079
Excuse me, pardon me.

171
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,355
Your boarding pass?

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,397
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

173
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,388
Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,637
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

175
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,717
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

176
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,794
All right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

177
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,439
This is very important.

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,870
All right.
What's the message?

179
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,558
I don't know.

180
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,668
Excuse me! Sir!

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,194
Excuse me! Sir?

182
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,998
I have a message for you.

183
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,153
Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

184
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,554
What?

185
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,998
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

186
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,639
There's no Rachel!

187
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,951
Don't give me that deep freeze!

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,549
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

189
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,152
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

190
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,159
It was nothing.

191
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,749
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,233
You know what?

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,830
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,514
Me, again?

195
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,950
Sure. Why not?

196
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,230
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,397
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you would be.

198
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,510
How do you mean?

199
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,950
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"

200
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,076
But you...

201
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,109
...you're a giver.

202
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,795
You're, like, the most generous
man I ever met.

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,271
I mean, you're practically a woman.

204
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,119
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,548
It's only a little torn.

206
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,872
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

207
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,959
I don't know.

208
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,794
I don't know.

209
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,790
I thought about it
all of the way there...

210
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,157
...and I thought about it
all the way back and...

211
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,992
You know, it's Ross!

212
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,350
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,754
-Sure!
-Sure.

214
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,758
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

215
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,552
...but I'm thinking...

216
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,914
...it'd be really great.

217
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,556
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!

218
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,673
The best part is you already
know all about him.

219
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,036
It's like starting on the 15th date.

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,550
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

221
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,192
Another good point.

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,591
At the 15th date, you're already
in a "relationship-py" place.

223
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,795
You're committed.

224
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,355
What happens if it doesn't work out?

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,635
Why isn't it working out?

226
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,518
Sometimes it doesn't.

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,190
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

228
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,390
No, I'm just--

229
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,999
Maybe there's someone else.

230
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,151
Is there?
Is there someone else?

231
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,960
No, there is no one else.

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

233
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,154
Hey, big--

234
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,476
Spender!

235
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,878
She's still asleep.

236
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,429
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

237
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,592
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

238
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,190
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

239
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,473
Well, last night
I couldn't do the thing...

240
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,557
...that usually makes me great.

241
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,751
So I had to do
all this other stuff.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,958
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

243
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,191
It was like
a ticker-tape parade!

244
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,510
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

245
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,554
It was amazing,
and not just for her.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,596
For me too!

247
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,798
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,991
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,750
You know? It's like,
I was able to appreciate it...

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,911
...on another level.

251
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,715
I didn't know you had
another level.

252
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,997
I know. Neither did I!

253
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,349
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

254
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,959
-From who?
-From you!

255
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,673
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

256
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,358
Well, it's the thought.

257
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,554
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

258
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,512
At gate 27B?

259
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,990
I've been thinking about it.

260
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,516
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

261
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,516
Why?

262
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,996
Because I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

263
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,356
I would be going out with
all of you.

264
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,999
There'd be all this pressure and--

265
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,958
No pressure, no pressure!

266
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,518
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

267
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,994
I'm not "so".

268
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,356
I was a teensy bit weird at first...

269
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,552
...but I'll be good.
I promise.

270
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,270
Who is it?

271
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,794
<i>It's me, Carl.</i>

272
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,075
Come on up.

273
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,952
Behind my brother's back?

274
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,075
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

275
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,155
Seven hundred bucks!

276
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,191
All right, you did it!

277
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,793
Do we have any fruit?

278
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,551
Man! A hell of a two weeks.

279
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,712
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,434
So you'll stick with this
"it's all for her" thing?

281
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,153
What, are you crazy?

282
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,758
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

283
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,555
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr...

284
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,557
...in that stupid electric car...

285
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,079
...I'll shoot myself!

286
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,192
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,638
...it's just that guy!

288
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,556
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

289
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,158
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

290
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,711
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

291
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,190
Can't do it, can you?

292
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,190
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

293
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,477
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

294
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,909
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

295
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,118
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

296
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,393
Rachel, come on.

297
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,551
Give us a chance.

298
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,753
It's too hard.

299
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,197
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

300
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,396
Who cares?
This is about us.

301
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,957
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
-You're, like, my best friend.
-I know.

303
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,712
If we broke up, and I lost you--

304
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,638
Why do you think
we'll break up?

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,555
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

306
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,836
No.

307
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,355
But it only has to happen once.

308
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,598
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

309
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,795
Right?

310
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,591
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

311
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,868
I don't know.

312
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,758
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

313
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,039
Well start looking!

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,469
Exactly!

315
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,557
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,553
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

317
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,189
Right!

318
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,589
You're right!

319
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,395
You know what?

320
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,837
I forgot, I need to pick up
a friend at the airport.

321
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,996
I am so sorry!

322
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,357
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

323
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,028
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!

324
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,434
But...

325
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,916
Excuse me! Pardon me!

326
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,950
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,390
Toby...

328
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,551
...for God's sake,
will you let it go?

329
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,392
There's no Rachel!

330
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,754
I got that!

331
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,356
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

332
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,550
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends!

333
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,399
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

334
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,953
No, they will.
I just...

335
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,190
-Can't wait!
-Can't wait!

336
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,556
Come on, they're gonna love you.
