1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,995
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,112
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,519
How was the party?

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,097
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:15,937
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:18,831
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,401
I go through the same thing.

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,548
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,313
I've put on weight?

10
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:31,320
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,269
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

12
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:40,077
I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

13
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,613
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

14
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:45,933
I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

15
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,526
Please?

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,719
Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:49,513
All right.

18
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:53,758
If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,857
Your boobs are fine.

20
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,442
I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,500
Come here. Come here!

22
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,669
Can't make hands meet!

23
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:08,878
The One Where Ross Finds Out

24
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,175
Let's do it!

25
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,349
What?

26
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:03,128
Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

27
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,432
It's cute!

28
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,845
And we're changing.

29
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:23,696
Come on, give me five more!

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,590
Five more!

31
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,193
Five more and I'll flash you.

32
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,688
One...

33
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,098
...two...

34
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,739
...two and a half.

35
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:37,994
Just show me one of them.

36
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:53,690
She's insane!

37
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:54,834
The woman is insane.

38
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,589
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

39
00:02:57,488 --> 00:03:00,719
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

40
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:03,478
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

41
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:05,121
Just tell her you want to stop.

42
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,885
I can't. All she get to
work is all she can got.

43
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:11,997
So that's why I was thinking, maybe we
could all pitch in and buy her own restraunt.

44
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,630
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

45
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:17,838
It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

46
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,566
...ordered champagne. Nice.

47
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:21,187
He still won't put out?

48
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,073
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

49
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,125
Sorry, Pheebs.

50
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,557
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

51
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,767
I like him a lot.

52
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,891
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

53
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,610
Why won't he give it up?

54
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,605
Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

55
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,266
If you know what I mean.

56
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,872
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

57
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,749
Maybe he's gay.

58
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,811
I don't think that's the problem.

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,667
We went dancing
the other night...

60
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,895
...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes...

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,034
I just definitely felt something.

62
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,307
But how much can you
tell from a look?

63
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,136
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

64
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,641
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

65
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,845
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

66
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,861
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

67
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:16,829
What?

68
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:21,073
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

69
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:22,339
You have a date?

70
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,339
Monica's setting me up.

71
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,977
What about Ross and...

72
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,276
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

73
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,702
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

74
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,806
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

75
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,702
You're okay about all this?

76
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,919
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

77
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:41,485
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

78
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:45,007
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

79
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,336
Hi, guys.

80
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:51,487
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,841
If you say his full name.

82
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:58,553
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

83
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,306
All right.

84
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:04,143
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.

85
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,734
Together?

86
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:07,786
Both of you? Together?

87
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:11,246
Lt'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,109
Well, isn't that just lovely?

89
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,740
That's something you'll enjoy...

90
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:19,245
...for a really, really,
really long time.

91
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,589
Hopefully.

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,023
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

93
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:25,353
With a man.

94
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,373
You guys have a really good night...

95
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:32,283
...and you two have a really good cat.

96
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,077
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

97
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:48,917
I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

98
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,577
If I seem a little nervous...

99
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:51,651
...I am.

100
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:53,842
How long do cats live?

101
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,207
I'm sorry?

102
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,318
Cats. How long do they live?

103
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,176
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

104
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,897
Maybe 15, 16 years.

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,130
Well, that's just great.

106
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:08,609
Cheers!

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,252
Right. Clink.

108
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,705
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

109
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:24,717
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

110
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,298
It's this thing.

111
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,135
It's not as bad as it sounds...

112
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,832
...but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

113
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh, that does sound...

114
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,429
He just started going out with her.

115
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,697
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

116
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,154
Yeah, he wishes.

117
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,714
I'm sorry. Look at me.

118
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,100
Michael, let's talk about you.

119
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,008
So...

120
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,950
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

121
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,047
- So I figured it out.
- What?

122
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,045
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

123
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,393
I'm not sexy enough.

124
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,593
Phoebe, that's crazy.

125
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,195
When I first met you,
you know what I said?

126
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:17,144
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

127
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,274
Really? That's so sweet.

128
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,031
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

129
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:31,325
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

130
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,587
You're right. You're right.

131
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,177
You are so "yum"!

132
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,772
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

133
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:00,982
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

134
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,896
Those things that live for a day.

135
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:04,783
What are they called?

136
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,245
Fruit flies?

137
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:08,742
Thank you.

138
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,038
Would you like dessert?

139
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,116
No dessert.

140
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,480
Just the check. Please.

141
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,938
Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

142
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,396
No, no, I am.

143
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:24,221
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

144
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,572
Oh, look at me.

145
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:27,920
Look at me.

146
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,565
I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

147
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,611
All I can think about is Ross...

148
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,450
...and his cat...

149
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,840
...and his Julie.

150
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,436
Look, do you want a
piece of pie or something?

151
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,715
Do like that man, I just
screwed this all over.

152
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:50,925
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

153
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:56,021
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

154
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,463
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure

155
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,947
Closure!

156
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,139
That's what it is!
That's what I need!

157
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,938
God, you're brilliant!

158
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,848
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

159
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:14,182
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

160
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,013
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

161
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:17,958
"I'm over you."

162
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,547
Over you.

163
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,482
That's what it is.

164
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:23,920
Closure.

165
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:27,125
Hello? Excuse me?

166
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,402
Excuse me. Hel

167
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,129
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?

168
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,864
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

169
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:36,143
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

170
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:37,965
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

171
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,742
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

172
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,893
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

173
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,013
All right. Fine.

174
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,092
I'll call you back.

175
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,129
Thank you.

176
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:57,969
So good people!

177
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:03,187
Machine.

178
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,217
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

179
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:10,384
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

180
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,774
I'm just calling to say that...

181
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:13,916
...everything's fine.

182
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:16,173
And I'm really happy for you...

183
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,292
...and your cat.

184
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:22,522
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

185
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:26,986
You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

186
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:30,235
...so obviously I am over you.

187
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,101
I am over you.

188
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:37,921
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

189
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:56,046
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

190
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:58,619
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

191
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,114
It's God's day.

192
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,510
If you say stop, then we stop.

193
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:06,615
Stop.

194
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:08,679
No, come on! We can't stop!

195
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,555
We got three more pounds to go!

196
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,528
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

197
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,514
And how was the date?

198
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,194
I think there was a restaurant.

199
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:36,890
I know there was wine.

200
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,565
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

201
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,718
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...

202
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:47,181
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

203
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,432
I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

204
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,962
I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

205
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,189
...but I don't remember.

206
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,362
There they are.

207
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,937
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

208
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,282
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

209
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:09,422
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,906
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:16,113
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:21,346
Who's Michael?

213
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:22,613
Oh, my God!

214
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,781
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

215
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,837
Give me the

216
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,640
You're over me?

217
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,897
Oh, God!

218
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,907
- You're
- Oh, God.

219
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,709
You're over me?

220
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,618
When were you...

221
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,162
...under me?

222
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,529
Rachel, do you...?

223
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,766
I mean, were you?

224
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,204
What?

225
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,101
Basically...

226
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,366
...lately, I've...

227
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,492
I've sort of had feelings for you.

228
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,466
You've had feelings for me?

229
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,330
So? You had feelings for me first!

230
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:24,004
You know about my
You know I had

231
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,813
You know?

232
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,358
Chandler told me.

233
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,083
When did he? When did he?
When did he?

234
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:34,198
When you were in China.

235
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:35,702
Meeting Julie.

236
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,624
Julie. That's
Oh, God!

237
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:42,799
I need to lie down.

238
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,247
No, I'm gonna stand.

239
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,899
I'm gonna stand...

240
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:50,713
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

241
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,978
Now you're over me?

242
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,720
Are you over me?

243
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,213
That's Julie.

244
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,333
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.

245
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,107
I'll be right down!

246
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,862
Wait, so you're going?

247
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,570
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

248
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,574
I mean, I've
You know, I've got a cab.

249
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,725
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

250
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,186
Cat!

251
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,118
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

252
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,521
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

253
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,515
I can't find the remote.

254
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:01,640
Thank you.

255
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:05,272
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

256
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,979
- And?
- And we did.

257
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,588
All right! Way to go!

258
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:10,894
Yea, me!

259
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,322
So how did it happen?

260
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,088
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

261
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,191
What did he say?

262
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:21,522
He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

263
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,259
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

264
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,735
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
And "Where is this going?"

265
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:33,011
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

266
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,955
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

267
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:43,185
Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

268
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,709
If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

269
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:49,869
So after a lot of talking...

270
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,357
...I convinced him.

271
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,089
Let me get this straight.

272
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:01,033
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

273
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,477
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

274
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,796
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

275
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,216
This man is my god!

276
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,949
This one is cute. Don't you think.

277
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,929
Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute.
They are all cute, they're kittens!

278
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,782
Let's just wrap one and
get the hell out of here.

279
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:32,933
- Are you OK!
- Yeah, me, sure!

280
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:40,931
You know this is the big step for us,
but I'm got feeling that will be OK.

281
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,300
I know, I know!

282
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:47,263
Do you have any cat really
old and incrediblly sick.

283
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,845
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.

284
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,445
Oh, see? We should have worked
that out before we came down here.

285
00:16:56,304 --> 00:17:02,607
OK, sweetie. I'm gonna narrow it down with this
one over here and this one with the stripes, OK?

286
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:07,102
- I have to pick?
- Whickever one you want.

287
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,282
I don't know. I mean
it's not easy to choose.

288
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:26,421
You know both cat are beautiful, funny.
You will be happy with either cat.

289
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:27,920
Do you want to take both?

290
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:36,899
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.

291
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:51,836
I didn't get a cat.

292
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:56,414
That's interesting.

293
00:17:56,267 --> 00:18:00,169
No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.

294
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,812
It's actually 100% the
opposite of interesting.

295
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,925
I got it, Ross.

296
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:06,656
You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

297
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,080
I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

298
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:11,873
I was doing great
before I knew about you!

299
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,259
You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

300
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,180
You should've said something before!

301
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:19,413
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

302
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,791
There was never a good time.

303
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:24,152
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

304
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:25,877
Not...

305
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:27,208
...every night.

306
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,241
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

307
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,791
You know, like Italian guys...

308
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,643
...or ex-fiances...

309
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,379
...or Italian guys.

310
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,212
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

311
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,761
The point is, I don't need
this right now!

312
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:47,340
Okay? It's too late.

313
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:50,289
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

314
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,273
You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

315
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:55,711
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

316
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,039
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

317
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,246
I don't need your ship!

318
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,171
- Good.
- Good!

319
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:04,538
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

320
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:52,079
Try the bottom one.

321
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,074
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

322
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,524
We're not working out.
It's over.

323
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,067
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

324
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:27,714
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

325
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:30,230
I don't mind the last pound.

326
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,879
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

327
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:36,404
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

328
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,706
What you gonna do, fat boy?

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,024
What?

330
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:47,081
Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

331
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,590
Well, thanks.

332
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:52,066
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

333
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:58,917
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

334
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:05,551
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

335
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,562
Well, no. But I...

336
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,250
If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

337
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,892
You know, I try to stay positive.

338
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,483
So you...

339
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:24,358
You feel like going for a run?

340
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:27,906
All right.

341
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:32,997
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
