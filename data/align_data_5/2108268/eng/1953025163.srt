1
00:00:00,863 --> 00:00:03,190
Hey, for those of you
that missed last week's episode,

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:04,388
I got really drunk, and I don't

3
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,521
really remember
what happened after that.

4
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:07,983
<i>Nobody's heard from Eddie?</i>

5
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>Not a word.</i>

6
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,651
<i>Eddie goes down to the corner</i>

7
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:11,922
<i>for a pack of Lucky's,</i>

8
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,057
<i>never heard from again.</i>

9
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:14,758
What you looking at?

10
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:15,928
Malik?

11
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,265
<i>Are you looking at Malik?</i>

12
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:18,836
Hoping you can tell me
a little bit about West Point.

13
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,006
- What's a kid got to do to get in?
- Suck my dick.

14
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,508
- I'm Little Hank.
- I'm Debbie.

15
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,777
- Tell me about Hank.
- He's cute, isn't he?

16
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:24,913
You're drinking my booze!

17
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:26,047
<i>I thought you were kidding.</i>

18
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,047
Hey, guys.

19
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,848
<i>Maybe I could hook you two up.</i>

20
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,784
- This is Richard, who you wanted to meet.
- Hi, Richard.

21
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:33,020
And when Richard does call,
just say yes. He's a good one.

22
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:34,255
What are you doing this weekend?

23
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,757
Something deplorable, I'm sure.

24
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,594
Do you want to come
with me to a wedding?

25
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:38,895
I'd love to show you off.

26
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,063
Thank you.

27
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,731
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

28
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:43,732
- Hey, you okay?
- Stay the fuck away from Jody.

29
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:46,436
And stay the fuck away
from this baby!

30
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:00,817
Thank you.

Still in there?

51
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:44,478
You told Carl to bring in money
for the winter squirrel fund.

52
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,480
I didn't tell him
to rent out Frank's room.

53
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,748
Dad rented it first
to that Chinese lady.

54
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:51,050
The minute you kids start
following Frank's example

55
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,985
is the minute I put a gun
in my mouth.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,588
How did you expect Carl
to get cash?

57
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,924
All you got to do
is swallow this.

58
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,996
She moved her stuff in
after you left for work.

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,765
You know what time Lip
got home last night?

60
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,568
You need a new razor.

61
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,036
Ew!

62
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,240
He rented the room to a hooker?

63
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,242
Carl said she works checkout
at the Jewel-Osco.

64
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,077
That's why they call her
Double Bag Bev.

65
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,278
She doesn't work there,

66
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:20,713
and that's not why
they call her that.

67
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:22,648
Carl!

68
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,084
Hi, Little Hank.

69
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:28,187
Hey, I want her out
of the house now.

70
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,289
$75 a week.

71
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,092
We'll charge a buck a peek.

72
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,426
Ten if she's working.

73
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:35,694
Carl!

74
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,062
No peepholes.

75
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,134
Hi. Kind of in the middle
of something.

76
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,135
Ahh!

77
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,136
Okay.

78
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,772
I wanted to make sure

79
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:47,039
that we were still on
before I got my nails done.

80
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,040
Still on.

81
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,108
Your boss at the club

82
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,109
give you a hard time

83
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,310
for taking the night off?

84
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:52,945
What's he gonna do, fire me?

85
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm probably out of a job

86
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,149
in two weeks when they close
the outdoor deck.

87
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:58,385
Well, I want you to know
that, um,

88
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,988
even though a wedding date
is customarily guaranteed sex,

89
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,223
you're under no obligation.

90
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:03,491
Good to know.

91
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,659
Just because society
expects us to.

92
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:06,661
All of society, huh?

93
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:07,662
I can pick you up.

94
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,330
Where do you live?

95
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,065
Got any Vagisil?

96
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,267
I've been scratching
under the hood all night.

97
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,602
My address is
11509 Lake Shore Drive.

98
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,070
See you at 2:30.

99
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,437
Right.

100
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,140
Lake Shore Drive?

101
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,249
What's for breakfast?

102
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:33,918
Cleaned the puke off the porch.

103
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:35,820
- That you?
- Better outside than in.

104
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,354
You're welcome.

105
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,789
What the hell is that?

106
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:40,157
Bacon bits.

107
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,592
Rad, huh?

108
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,430
They're for mom.

109
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:48,033
Think she'll come out today?

110
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,434
Not likely.

111
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,504
Airplane wheel missed
her by an inch.

112
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:54,639
Friendly skies, indeed.

113
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,145
Mrs. Jackson home?

114
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,048
Sheils?

115
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,283
Who is it?

116
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,119
Me. Frank.

117
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:19,833
The bedpan is full.

118
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,401
Cops are downstairs.

119
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,969
They found Eddie.

120
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,739
Oh. Where was he,
at his brother's in Bridgeport?

121
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,407
Michiana?

122
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,276
Bottom of Lake Michigan.

123
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,388
Mm... perfect timing.

124
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:44,424
Mm.

125
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,061
Hey, babe.

126
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,101
Where's that morning wood?

127
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:58,004
Your dad's dead.

128
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,372
Nice try,

129
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,174
but that doesn't
turn me on anymore.

130
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,877
Really. Your-your dad.

131
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm not gonna stay
down here forever,

132
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:08,283
so stop talking
about my fucking dad

133
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,285
and get your dick hard.

134
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,257
Out of milk;
Bev wants breakfast.

135
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,125
Oh, come on. What about
all those house-sitting jobs?

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
We got any Virginia Slims?

137
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,095
Let's try the neighbors.

138
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,697
If we get bloody-mary mix,

139
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,200
Bev promised she'd
show us a tit.

140
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,439
Little Hank--
what does he like?

141
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,808
- What's he into?
- I don't know. Stuff.

142
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,243
- Why?
- What stuff?

143
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,814
Knives, blunts, commandos,
switchblades, butterflies.

144
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:43,653
Where can I get knives
and blunts?

145
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:47,391
Alley behind the OTB. Ask
for Raoul, but bring a rag.

146
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:49,460
Sometimes he doesn't bother to
wipe the blood off the blades.

147
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,966
Carl's boarder. Put in a
load a couple minutes ago.

148
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,935
Lip up?

149
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,986
Everyone's wondering
if you've got PTSD.

150
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,323
Late night working in
the ice cream truck.

151
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,925
So Karen knocked up's
got nothing

152
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,493
to do with the hermit thing?

153
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,265
Pass me my shirt?

154
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,634
What was it about her
that first caught your eye?

155
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,137
Um....

156
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:40,275
Easy, convenient
and low-maintenance.

157
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,877
Why?

158
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,345
Think I could be easy,
convenient and low-maintenance?

159
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,880
This about Little Hank?

160
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,685
Look, I caught him trying to
steal our toaster the other day.

161
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,287
Pint-sized klepto
will be in juvie

162
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,289
before you get your first kiss.

163
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:56,458
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

164
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,061
Do I have to explain that
to you of all people?

165
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:04,632
Afraid it's not just about
being easy and convenient, Debs.

166
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,201
It's, uh, chemical.

167
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,803
Pheromones, a person's scent.

168
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:12,940
You know? You can't fake it.

169
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,544
Hey. Finally up.

170
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,979
Smoke?

171
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:20,814
Yup.

172
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:23,517
You know there's a
prostitute in Frank's room?

173
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,153
Double bag Bev. Needed
a place to stay. Win-win.

174
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,257
Yeah, as long as you can't catch
AIDS from a washing machine.

175
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,892
Mm. They got drugs
for that now.

176
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,493
It's like a cold.

177
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,362
She's single-handedly
catapulting Carl into puberty.

178
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,063
Yeah, well, at least she's not
bringing her work home, right?

179
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,564
She better not.

180
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,099
And no more
washing machine freebies.

181
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:43,168
If she charges
by the load, so can we.

182
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:47,071
Talk to Karen?

183
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,539
Why would I?

184
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,342
Look, it could be anyone's kid.

185
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,044
Uh, Owen Lindquist,

186
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:55,680
the guy on Wolcott with the
lazy eye and the Mustang.

187
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:58,116
- Frank.
- You use protection?

188
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,451
She's on the pill.

189
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,785
Yeah, so she said.

190
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,020
How many times
you sleep with her?

191
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:03,455
What, you keep count?

192
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,291
Ballpark. How many times a week?

193
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,060
Six, seven.

194
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:09,029
Yeah, for what,
like, eight months?

195
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,464
That's...

196
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:12,766
- Round 224.
- And what about other guys?

197
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,068
Ten sound about right?

198
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,204
That's 20 to one odds.

199
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:20,107
You're the one who takes book.
You like those odds?

200
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:22,142
If you're gonna yell
at me, go ahead.

201
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,113
I'm not your mother.

202
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,019
So what are you gonna do?

203
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:37,358
I'm not taking care
of another kid.

204
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,469
Sheils?

205
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:52,172
Even Osama had to come out of
his cave every once in a while.

206
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,412
And look what happened to him.

207
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,814
I get it.

208
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,415
So many emotions

209
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,017
to process.

210
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,019
I... am...

211
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:09,323
Here... 100%.

212
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,824
Whatever you need.

213
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:12,326
He was the father

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,161
- of my baby.
- I...

215
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,465
You grieve, and leave
mundane matters to me.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,135
Eddie's affairs-- pension,
insurance, things like that.

217
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:24,105
Just tell me where the
paperwork is, and I will...

218
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,441
Oh, Frank, why would something
like this happen?

219
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,377
Nothing could make his
eternal slumber more peaceful

220
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:31,879
than knowing that you

221
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,981
And Karen

222
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,817
were properly taken care of.

223
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,519
The papers aren't
in the file cabinet.

224
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,454
I checked.

225
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:43,024
Do you think he felt any pain?

226
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,692
Oh.

227
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,627
The important thing is,

228
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:49,830
I'm sure he was
the kind of father

229
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,832
who provided for his family.

230
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,338
I just need his social
security number.

231
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:58,906
Poor Eddie.

232
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,580
Jonah and I are off
to the playground.

233
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,048
Anybody offers you candy,

234
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,483
that's code for crack.

235
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,185
Apple jacks, crunch 'n munch,

236
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,654
hotcakes, jellybeans, fries,
caviar, crackers, dip--

237
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,222
all crack.

238
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,925
Say, "no, thank you." Got it.
I'll go tell Malik.

239
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,528
- Malik?
- We're having a play date.

240
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,663
Sounds more like a date date.

241
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,100
I know what goes on in the
playground besides hopscotch

242
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,335
and middle-aged
men jacking off.

243
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,604
- That kid's a player.
- He's the best player!

244
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,107
He showed me an old basketball
game on TV last night,

245
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,575
and I learned so much.

246
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,010
Did you know that Chinese people

247
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:35,578
can grow to be seven feet tall?

248
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,380
Last night? He
skipped the game?

249
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:39,950
Hey, ready to bounce, E?

250
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:41,719
Hey, Ms. V.

251
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,454
You don't skip out on your team
unless you're lying

252
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,957
in a hospital bed with an iv
drip and a bullet in your spine.

253
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,392
The game last night?

254
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,927
We didn't have no game.

255
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,429
Kev said there was a game.

256
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:51,797
Nah, you got it twisted.

257
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:53,231
Next game's tomorrow.

258
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:54,565
Hey, let's get ghost.

259
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,968
- Okay.
- Later, miss V.

260
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:04,208
On the house?

261
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,377
I'm in mourning.

262
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,745
Freebies for family
only, Frank.

263
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,747
Then start the mother
of all tabs.

264
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,549
Once Eddie's life insurance
money kicks in,

265
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,983
moderation's gonna be a thing
of the past.

266
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,253
- Moderation?
- How much you talking about?

267
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,423
City life.
Got to be 50k at least.

268
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:22,226
A toast-- to Eddie Jackson.

269
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,494
Who had
the foresight to take care

270
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:25,963
of those he loved.

271
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:28,731
I wouldn't celebrate
just yet, Frank.

272
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,233
You're not the only
one interested

273
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,668
in Eddie's life insurance.

274
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,571
Police are asking
a lot of questions.

275
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,975
So?

276
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,278
Eddie was weighed down
with a cement block.

277
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,680
So?

278
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,248
So, everyone here

279
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:47,083
heard Eddie threaten
to kill you.

280
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:48,818

other way around.

Murder's not my bag.

282

I don't have the constitution.
Blood makes me queasy.

283
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,758
And I didn't plant that
pipe bomb down at the mosque,

284
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,927
but it was on my route,
so the pigs got a warrant.

285
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,996
Never would have found

filmed naked, he shouldn't

289
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,767
have left the blinds open when

290
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,334
he took her

- Identity theft.

00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,171
than the alternative.

360
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,839
As long as you
don't run into Adam.

361
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,174
He's out of the country,

362
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,775
raping some emerging market.

363
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,311
Any chance moneybags
airlifts you out of the ghetto?

364
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,613
More likely he's got
a girl in every port.

365
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:10,814
Piece of work.

366
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,284
Kev'd never cheat on you.

367
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:16,886
Go talk to him.
Clear it up.

368
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,559
That's the Gallagher sperm.

369
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,394
Ambitious, relentless--

370
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,396
everything we're not
once we're born.

371
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,631
Like heat-seeking,

372
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,133
baby-making guided missiles.

373
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,668
Won't be long before
the whole country's

374
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,503
nothing but Mexicans
and Gallaghers.

375
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,572
Son... it's time

376
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,207
we had the talk.

377
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,075
Little late for that, huh?

378
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,144
Different talk.
She gonna keep it?

379
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,146
Looks like it.

380
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,818
Big responsibility,

381
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:47,853
being a parent.

382
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,254
Is that right?

383
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,056
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

384
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,590
My philosophy.
You got to let kids

385
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,891
learn for themselves.

386
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,827
You mean, <i>fend</i> for themselves?

387
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,397
You give a man a fish,
you've fed him for a day.

388
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,833
<i>Teach</i> a man to fish,
you've fed him for a lifetime.

389
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,435
I raise fishermen.

390
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:04,103
The best gift you can give,

391
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:05,671
neglect.

392
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,840
Neglect fosters
self-reliance.

393
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:10,610
Now, do the right thing.

394
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,712
Split.

395
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,181
Not our fault

396
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,783
she was careless.

397
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:19,518
Now, I need an alibi
for Eddie Jackson's murder.

398
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,787
- Why, did you kill him?
- No.

399
00:17:21,822 --> 00:17:23,522
- Eddie's dead?
- Yep.

400
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,524
- Hey, does Karen know?
- You got to swear

401
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,693
we were on a camping trip,
a long weekend

402
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,963
- in Wisconsin.
- Hey, well, Ian, watch Liam.

403
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,599
We were on a camping trip...

404
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,268
Perjure myself?
Yeah, that'll look great

405
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,936

406
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,573

I hear lying to cops is his specialty.

407
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,076

- No, it's in Missouri.
- Oh.

414

Oh, no, we've been
trying for months.

415
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,902
Really? My great-grandpas
beat me with a dustbuster.

416
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,337
Why would God make us
physically ready

if he didn't want us
to have children?

418
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:13,673
True that.

419
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,778
That's what my sister-wives
told me while they held me down.

420
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:19,145
For Clyde, my husband.

421
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,114
They were right.

422
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,918
I-it stopped hurting after
the first couple dozen times.

423

And once you get past that

424
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,788
razor-blade-slicing-you
from-the-inside sensation,

425
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,757
you feel much closer to God.

426
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,092
Wait,

427
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:33,493
they held you down?

428
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,195
Clyde wanted to do it himself,

429
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,997
but he was much too weak.

430
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,467
Rheumatoid arthritis.

431
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,371
I hope someone
takes care of him.

432
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,173
Don't you think
Clyde deserves that?

433
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,675
- Uh, for sure.
- I would

434
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,343
do it myself,
but he's in prison.

435

- Had an idea.

Since you've been
so busy lately,

443
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,964
- date night.
- I love it.

444
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:08,998
I'll cook.

445
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,066
Tomorrow?

446
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,202
Can't tomorrow.
Got a game.

447
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,403
Two games in three nights?
Didn't you

448
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,838
just have one last
night? Or did I

449
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,640
- get that mixed up?
- No, I had a game last night.

450

Oh, V, you should've been there.

I coach from my sack.

455
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,750
I had the fat Nicaraguan kid

456

set a pick for Malik.

457
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,253
What? Swish.

Three-pointer. Mm!

459
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,257
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

460
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,728
It was a hell of a game.

461
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:42,401

Wow. Can't wait to get the
asshole in the ground, huh?

want to get back at him?

471
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:09,528
Go at it on his
grave, you know?

472
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,130
It's a great way
to send him off.

473
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:13,098

he'll be spending eternity

penis or a huge clit.

Four years later, her boy's
stabbing other kids with a fork.

- Usually, after Veronica

with their urologist?

718
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,915
Listen, if a man has
your testicles in his grip,

719
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,250
you'll do whatever he asks.

720
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,518
Little known fact--

721
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:29,521
Gerald Ford was hung
like a bear.

722
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,190
You're really bad
at flirting, you know that?

723
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:32,624
What makes you think
I'm trying to flirt?

724
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:34,960
Huh, getting me
liquored up and alone?

725
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:37,096
Oh, yeah,
nothing closes the deal

726
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:39,699
like deceased heads of state.

727
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,467
Thought I was under no
obligation to sleep with you.

728
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:45,772
Oh, well, I was kind of hoping
that you'd just want to.

729
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:47,474
Who says I don't?

730
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,751
Wedding's starting.

731
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,327
Hi, Holly.

732
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,661
What's with the makeup?

733
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,630
I'm sending stronger signals.

734
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,633
Did I leave my underwear
in your brother's room?

735
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,834
It was my lucky pair.

736
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,235
Didn't see it.

737
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,070
You want to hang out
later at the barbecue?

738
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,571
I'm busy.

739
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:16,605
Lip'll be there.

740
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
He wants to double.

741
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:18,974
He said that?

742
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,108
Yeah.

743
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:23,845
You, Lip, me, Little Hank.

744
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:26,681
Great, well, you can keep that
Little Hank perv off my back.

745
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:29,351
- Meet up with you there?
- Yeah.

746
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,419
Holly.

747
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,788
Uh, how do I look?

748
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,427
Like you're going to be a virgin
for the rest of your life.

749
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,973
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

750
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,845
Did you talk to Sheila?

751
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,546
Wait, where are you taking me?

752
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,781
Cook County?

753
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,783
I won't, I won't last a week.

754
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,054
Get the hell out.

755
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,294
You're letting me go?

756
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,395
For now.

757
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,596
Don't leave the city.

758
00:32:24,907 --> 00:32:25,874
Oh.

759
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:27,308
Well, hello.

760
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:29,644
Get naked now.

761
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:31,479
Yes, sir.

762
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:33,681
Sent Ethel to the store.

763
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:35,049
Get your ass on that bench.

764
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,385
Oh, I love mistress Veronica.

765
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,590
Yes.

766
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,825
Oh, here it comes.

767
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,660
Got the handcuffs.

768
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:47,061
An oldie but a goodie.

769
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,064
Hey, just remember, if you're
going to sit on my face,

770
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:51,032
I have that sinus thing, okay?

771
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:52,701
Mmm...

772
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:56,739
Ah, what is this,
what's this for?

773
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,907
The blood.

774
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,376
The blood?

775
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,611
Garden shears?

776
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,113
Whoa, that's not funny.

777
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,281
What's the bitch's name?

778
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,516
Who-- what are
you talking about?

779
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,017
The bitch's name!

780
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,286
- Who, who?!
- West 47th.

781
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,355
How you know about that?

782
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,557
Aah, miss Grodanz, all right?

783
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,125
Please don't cut my dick.

784
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,226
You're screwing some slut,
and you don't

785
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,227
even know her first name?

786
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:17,796
No... sh-sh-she's my tutor.

787
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,799
What, teaching you how
to fuck behind my back?

788
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,866
Read.

789
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,234
That's the best you can do?

790
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,536
I swear to God it's true.

791
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,405
She's teaching me how to read.

792
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,074
Yo, where are the keys?

793
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:33,179
In my p-u-r-s-e.

794
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:37,283
V, V!

795
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:50,763
Detective happen to drop by?

796
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,570
I can explain.

797
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:59,572
Don't tell me,

798
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:01,941
tell mom.

799
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,917
Sheils,

800
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,918
it's Frank.

801
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,324
I'm sorry.

802
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,592
Why didn't you tell me?

803
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,864
Didn't want you to
think less of me.

804
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,766
Taking advantage
of somebody so vulnerable?

805
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,305
You poor thing.

806
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,780
Karen told
the authorities everything.

807
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,184
D-define everything.

808
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:49,452
You came home

809
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:52,521
from a work-related injury,

810
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,124
barely conscious
from the pain pills

811
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,892
the doctor prescribed,

812
00:34:56,926 --> 00:35:00,295
in need of kindness and care,

813
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:04,899
and instead Karen lured you
into the basement

814
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,667
and...

815
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,970
Just did what she did to you.

816
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,639
Just wanted

817
00:35:11,673 --> 00:35:13,340
to get back at her father.

818
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,043
You weren't even aroused.

819
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:20,849
She told the police,
the size of a baby carrot.

820
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:25,321
I am so sorry
that my daughter raped you.

821
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,874
Miss Grodanz?

822
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:46,376
Hi. Who are you?

823
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,544
I'm the woman whose
man you're fucking.

824
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,879
I'm done with spelling.

825
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,881
I'll start

826
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,883
my reading.

827
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,963
Thank you.

828
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:10,499
Thanks for taking out my dad.

829
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,716
Lovely dress.

830
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,117
Those vows.

831
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:29,254
Why do people insist
on writing them themselves?

832
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:33,458
Hmm, I'm gonna run
to the bathroom.

833
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,592
- Okay.
- I'll see you at the table.

834
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,627
Okay.

835
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,465
So, off campus, huh?

836
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,800
What?

837
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,569
- You said you lived off campus.
- Yeah.

838
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,437
Yeah, Princeton doesn't let
students live off campus

839
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,239
until junior year.

840
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:51,907
- New rules.
- Oh, come on.

841
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,575
Which agency you with?
You can tell me.

842
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,110
Hell, I might need to
schedule a night myself.

843
00:36:55,144 --> 00:36:56,645
Excuse me?

844
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,913
God, only Richard'd have
the stones to bring a pro

845
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:00,181
to a wedding.

846
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:01,649
You think I'm a hooker?

847
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:02,817
No, n-no, no.

848
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,185
Hookers get paid
in small bills,

849
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,187
not American Express Platinum.

850
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,023
- You got to be, what, two grand, three?
- I'm not a fucking escort.

851
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,859
So, Richard doesn't know you've
been lying about Princeton?

852
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,094
You're just a gold digger

853
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,362
after his money?

854
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,030
I haven't taken
a goddamn thing from him.

855
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:17,032
Right. I have
an idea--

856
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:20,035
how about you give me a taste
or I tell him the truth?

857
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,437
Hey, hey.

858
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,506
T-- uh, table six
right over there.

859
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,541
Great, me, too.

860
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,043
I don't go to Princeton.

861
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,846
Never went to college,
and if assholes like this did,

862
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,113
I'm glad I didn't.

863
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,249
Don't worry, I'll get a cab.

864
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,621
What the fuck, Garvin?

865
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,158
Hey, Fiona, I'll take you.

866
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,559
No, thanks.

867
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,128
You know where I can get
the El around here?

868
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,331
Come on, hey,
Greg is an asshole.

869
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,632
He always has been.

870
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,667
He got expelled twice.

871
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,135
They only let him graduate

872
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,137
after his dad built
the school a library.

873
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:54,239
Come on, I-I'm sorry.

874
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,041
Let me take you, please.

875
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,645
Hey, bring the,
bring the car around.

876
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,415
I want to know
whose it is-- the kid.

877
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,983
Simple test.

878
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,551
Jody is the father.

879
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,153
What, you take math lessons
from a creationist?

880
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,688
You met him a month ago.

881
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,857
We're married now--
it makes him the dad.

882
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,725
- Jody!
- Makes him the stepdad.

883
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,394
Real dads are overrated.

884
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,662
Better this way.

885
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,164
Oh, with the village idiot?

886
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,933
Quiet and nice doesn't
make him an idiot.

887
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:24,870
At least I know he'll be here.

888
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,105
I'm not going anywhere.

889
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,373
South Side forever?

890
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,641
I wouldn't bail.

891
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:32,412
I'm not my dad.

892
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:33,580
- Get out.
- You hear me?

893
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,214
I'm not my fucking dad!

894
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,783
Everything cool?

895
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,852
Fine.

896
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:40,886
Enjoy your life
of monosyllables

897
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,354
and knock-knock jokes.

898
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,056
At least I know his
dad won't fuck me.

899
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,625
Don't underestimate yourself.

900
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,427
I'm sure it'll be
his turn at some point.

901
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,438
Money up front, no rough stuff.

902
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:00,940
You here for Bev?

903
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:03,343
Your brother.

904
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,947
Some army dude's here for you.

905
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:12,087
Exemplary salute.

906
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,655
Cadet Colonel Gallagher,
Junior ROTC.

907
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,124
Colonel McNally,
Department Of Defense.

908
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:18,493
- You Lip's brother?
- Ian.

909
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:19,995
He mentioned
you were taking an interest,

910
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:21,496
but didn't say
you were stopping by.

911
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,832
- Oh, I hope that's okay.
- Yes, sir.

912
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:26,468
Silver Star. Iraq?

913
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:29,003
- Afghanistan.
- Ah.

914
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:31,506
I got sand in parts of my
body I still can't get out.

915
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,108
Listen, this is a
West Point application.

916
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,609
I wanted to deliver
it personally.

917
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:36,579
It's been a goal
for a long time.

918
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,415
Well, if I have anything to
say about it, he'll reach it.

919
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,684
Big future, your brother.

920
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,787
The nature of
combat's changing.

921
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,189
We need all the creative
thinkers we can get.

922
00:39:46,224 --> 00:39:47,658
Is Lip home?

923
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,028
You'll make sure he gets that?

924
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:52,430
Yes, sir.

925
00:39:52,464 --> 00:39:54,865
Thanks.

926
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:03,774
I knew you
didn't go to Princeton.

927
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,476
You don't $500 million worth of
business a year

928
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,679
without being able
to read people.

929
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:15,384
I must admit, though,
I was curious to see

930
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:18,454
how long you'd be able to
keep the whole thing going.

931
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:23,460
Where should I tell
the driver you live?

932
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:28,199
South Side.

933
00:40:50,256 --> 00:40:52,624
Help me look like you?

934
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:58,664
Two things Fiona says are a
waste of money, makeup and bras.

935
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:00,065
Yeah, well,
if I believed everything

936
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,433
my older siblings told me,

937
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:02,534
I'd still think
I was a botched abortion.

938
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,236
You have great eyes.

939
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,237
Thanks, but eyes don't
stop a teenage boy.

940
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:09,174
I need boobs or some junk
in the trunk, you know?

941
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:11,343
- How old are you?
- 11.

942
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:13,678
If I were Jewish, I'd
be a woman next year.

943
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,880
- Why the rush?
- You sound just like my sister.

944
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:18,850
Yeah, well, there's plenty of
time to be disappointed by men.

945
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:21,719
Why does everyone else
get to grow up but me?

946
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:24,788
One day you'll look back and
wish it didn't happen so fast.

947
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:26,223
Trust me.

948
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:27,758
There.

949
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:33,763
This'll get his attention?

950
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:36,199
If it doesn't,
he's not worth it.

951
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:40,770
Who's your friend?

952
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,141
65, 66,

953
00:41:45,175 --> 00:41:47,042
67, 68...

954
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:48,210
Went to Karen's.

955
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,778
Tried to step up.

956
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:51,213
- She told me to fuck off.
- 73,

957
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:52,447
- you believe that?
- 74,

958
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,116
75, 76,

959
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,919
- 77, 78...
- Rather play house with Keanu.

960
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:58,288
81, 82...

961
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,757
You hear what I said?

962
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:02,159
How many push-ups can you do?

963
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:04,061
What, right now, stoned?

964
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:05,430
Your best day.

965
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:06,765
I don't know. Uh, five, six.

966
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:08,600
How many miles?

967
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,503
- Depends. Who's chasing me?
- I can do

968
00:42:12,538 --> 00:42:14,672
100 push-ups at a time,
run a six-minute mile

969
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,941
and hit a freckle from
200 yards with an M-16.

970
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:19,076
Dude, you need this
more than I do.

971
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,444
Know what it means
to have a war hero

972
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:21,679
recommend you for West Point?

973
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:23,313
I told you,
I'm working that angle.

974
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:24,748
- It takes time.
- No need.

975
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:27,650
It worked.

976
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:29,352
What, McNally
brought this for you?

977
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:30,520
Not me.

978
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,856
Congratulations.

979
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:40,464
Look, I didn't have a chance
to mention you yet, all right?

980
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:41,865
It's a misunderstanding.

981
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,300
I'll find him tomorrow.

982
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,670
Don't worry about it.

983
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:48,339
What, you're really gonna
be a baby about this?

984
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:50,275
You're the only reason
I was even hanging out

985
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,676
with that
water boarder McNally.

986
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:54,479
I don't need your help.

987
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:56,614
Oh, well, you should have
told me that

988
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:59,149
before I spent my summer trying
to explain fucking trigonometry.

989
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,485
All right, I didn't even
want you to do this!

990
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,687
I'll do it on my own now, okay?

991
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,024
You can't do shit on your own.

992
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:10,426
Fuck you, Lip.

993
00:43:12,028 --> 00:43:14,796
You can get back to your
whore who can't be sure

994
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,165
if her kid is your
son or your brother.

995
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:48,261
I'll make West Point on my own.

996
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:50,597
I don't need you.

997
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,377
Shh!

998
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:05,947
Just got the babies to sleep.

999
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:09,017
I shouted for 20 minutes
before Malik heard me.

1000
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,453
You let that girl go out
on a date with a boy

1001
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:12,888
who knows how
to pick handcuffs?

1002
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:14,623
Your mom let you
go out with me.

1003
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:16,424
We turned out okay.

1004
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:18,893
- I think.
- If you didn't know how to read,

1005
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:20,261
how did you get
your driver's license?

1006
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:21,963
- They give those to anybody.
- Our taxes?

1007
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:23,398
- Lip.
- Cards on my birthday?

1008
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:25,433
- Debbie.
- Explains why

1009
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,034
the "I"s were
dotted with hearts.

1010
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:28,569
Look, I can read, all right?

1011
00:44:28,604 --> 00:44:30,738
It's just I had trouble
with it my entire life.

1012
00:44:30,773 --> 00:44:32,206
It gets messed up. I...

1013
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:33,708
It takes a long time.

1014
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:35,276
From one school to the next,

1015
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,878
from one foster care
to the next,

1016
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:38,413
it never got fixed.

1017
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:40,114
It's not like I'm unliterate.

1018
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:43,552
- Why didn't you tell me?
- 'Cause I was ashamed, V.

1019
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:46,322
I wanted to do something
nice for our anniversary.

1020
00:44:46,356 --> 00:44:48,157
A card I wrote myself.

1021
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:51,293
Ah, so...

1022
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,995
"I want to lick every inch

1023
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:55,264
of your body."
You wrote this?

1024
00:44:55,298 --> 00:44:56,999
I wanted to be romantic.

1025
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:01,937
We turned out more than okay.

1026
00:45:06,276 --> 00:45:08,011
♪ one, two, three... ♪

1027
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,479
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1028
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:13,616
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

1029
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:16,453
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go...

1030
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:28,131
Ah.

1031
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:29,966
Detective, I smell bacon.

1032
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:33,637
What do you want, Gallagher?

1033
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:35,506
No hard feelings. Whoa.

1034
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,408
Except for the one I have
for your better half here.

1035
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:43,547
Lesson learned-- it's gonna take
a lot more than that

1036
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,383
to bring down Frank Gallagher.

1037
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,218
I know you're responsible
for Eddie Jackson's death.

1038
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,821
Ah. Try proving it.

1039
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:52,224
I intend to.

1040
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:00,966
My dad killed a guy.

1041
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,044
What's wrong?

1042
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:15,747
Holly blew off the flowers
I stole for her.

1043
00:46:15,782 --> 00:46:18,583
You want to go see Raoul
in the alley behind the OTB?

1044
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:21,053
Just got a new switchblade in,

1045
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:23,088
swears it has
nothing at all to do

1046
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:26,226
with that cop
stabbing in Pullman.

1047
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,762
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1048
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:30,030
Don't lay on your back.

1049
00:46:30,064 --> 00:46:31,831
You could choke
on your own vomit.

1050
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:34,200
You need water and bread
to soak up the alcohol.

1051
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:35,602
I'll get hamburger buns.

1052
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:37,203
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1053
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:38,872
Hey! Hey!

1054
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:46,045
Want these?

1055
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:00,461
Won't start.

1056
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:02,263
Cops released the report.

1057
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:05,300
Cause of death-- inconclusive.

1058
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,102
You okay?

1059
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:09,538
Yeah.

1060
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:16,613
Hey, what took you so long?

1061
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,248
Jesus. What do you want?

1062
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:19,782
I got a morning after pill

1063
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:21,184
from my sister.

1064
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,794
Watch it, asshole.

1065
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:34,629
- How about some fucking respect?
- What, for you?

1066
00:47:34,664 --> 00:47:37,065
Your mom's on a steady diet
of prison guard dick

1067
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,500
because you didn't have
the balls

1068
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:40,168
to stand up
to your dad yourself.

1069
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:42,104
What, you never learned how
to throw a fucking punch?

1070
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:48,779
Oh, that's it?

1071
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:51,283
Now wonder your dad
beat the shit out of you.

1072
00:47:52,485 --> 00:47:54,987
Sheils, it's me.

1073
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:57,323
I got a surprise for you.

1074
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:59,359
Frank, you're back
from the barbeque!

1075
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:01,327
I brought the barbecue to you,

1076
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:05,031
- my one and only girl.
- Aw, Frank.

1077
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:07,834
Come downstairs;
Let me serve for once.

1078
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,969
It looks delicious.

1079
00:48:10,004 --> 00:48:11,137
Table's all set.

1080
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:13,840
Oh. What a lovely

1081
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,009
way to end a hard day.

1082
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:17,844
That's all behind us now.

1083
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:19,613
Come downstairs,
have a nice dinner,

1084
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,382
and we'll wrap up
Eddie's affairs.

1085
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,052
Where's his life insurance
policy again?

1086
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,720
One good thing
that came out of this.

1087
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,690
I'm free to marry.

1088
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:30,492
Ma... marry?

1089
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:34,330
I...

1090
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:37,633
Whoa!

1091
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:40,002
That's in there for
a strike and the count's now...

1092
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:53,748
Naav... el.

1093
00:48:53,783 --> 00:48:57,418
Naav... el.

1094
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:59,320
Naavel. Navel!

1095
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:00,855
Yes.

1096
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,827
Mmm. Only three more
till I get to your hoo-ha.

1097
00:49:13,903 --> 00:49:16,037
Hey, talked to my pops.

1098
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:18,039
He's gonna take care
of your Clyde.

1099
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:21,075
Really? Thank you!

1100
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,044
Oh.

1101
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,854
You Clyde?

1102
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,589

How many?

1113
00:50:40,493 --> 00:50:42,962
Six of us.

1114
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:46,165
It looks a lot like where
I grew up in New Haven.

1115
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:49,201
Hey, I'm here next
week for a meeting.

1116
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:50,937
Want to go to dinner?

1117
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:52,805
I promise, just us this time.

1118
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,942
Okay.

1119
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:57,610
I want you to have this.

1120
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:03,182
I'd just end up selling it
for food and toilet paper.

1121
00:51:06,686 --> 00:51:08,553
Hey.

1122
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:10,989
Hey.

1123
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:12,891
Looks like I missed the party.

1124
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:23,901
Tony around?

1125
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:32,009
Tell him I came by.

1126
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:45,488
You look great by the way.

1127
00:51:49,425 --> 00:51:51,393
Great.
