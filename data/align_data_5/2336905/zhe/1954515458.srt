切斯特  你怎么还没换衣服

7
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,180
-还有15分钟就到预约时间了  -嘘

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,160
他回来了

每晚八点  分秒不差

那个西装革履的金发男子都会出现

11
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,680
恰克和乔安要等急了
Chuck and Joanne are going to be waiting.

12
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,570
你不懂
You don't understand!

13
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,110
每天晚上  他都如出一辙
Every night, he does this.

14
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,730
一天都不落
Every single night.

15
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,630
{\an8}周三

16
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,130
他走出大楼
He steps out of this building,

17
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,950
迈七步  停下
walks exactly seven paces, stops,

18
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,320
然后微笑
and smiles.

{\an8}周五

21
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,090
亲爱的  你别吓我好吗
Honey, I am worried about you.

22
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,950
他是不是想和某人接头
Is he trying to communicate with someone?

23
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,380
他是不是想要联络我
Is he trying to communicate with me?

24
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,580
他为什么要这么做啊
Why is he doing this?!

25
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,500
除了不让你在家里放屁之外
But aside from not being able to fart in the apartment,

26
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,680
-和昆茵相处得怎么样  -很不错啊
- how's living with Quinn? - Oh, it's great.

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,110
没错
Yep.

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,690
和昆茵住在一起感觉很棒
Living with Quinn is great.

29
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,780
简直就是妙趣横生  妙不可言
Great, great, great... great.

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,480
到底是有多苦
So how bad is it?

31
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,700
苦不堪言啊
Pretty bad.

32
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,900
昨天晚上
Last night,

33
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,060
我八点钟刚放完屁回来
I had just come back 8:00 fart.

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,010
-好  -接着说
- Sure. - Go on.

35
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,740
信箱还是空的
Still no mail.

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,560
邮差每天只送一次信吧
I think they only deliver it once a day.

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,070
我搬进来之前  把自己的东西都卖了
Hey, listen, when I moved in here, I sold all my stuff

38
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,700
因为我知道你希望家里保持原样
because I know you like your place as is,

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,650
我对此完全没意见
and I was totally fine with that.

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,950
我只有一个小要求
Just one little thing:

41
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,850
能不能不用你的咖啡杯
would it be okay if instead of using your coffee mugs,

42
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,170
换用我的
we use mine?

43
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,570
不行
No.

44
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,250
巴尼  她为了你把自己的东西都卖了
Barney, she got rid of all of her stuff for you.

45
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,540
我知道问题出在哪儿了
Oh, I see what this is really about.

46
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,570
不就是杯子嘛
Yeah, mugs.

47
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
咖啡
Coffee?

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,510
茶
Tea?

49
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,160
信仰冲突
Religion.

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,330
问题在你  你打从心眼里觉得
This is about the fact that you don't think

51
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,490
这段恋情不会长久
this relationship is gonna last.

52
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,030
所以你才不想丢掉自己的东西
That's why you don't want to throw anything out.

53
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,420
因为你们早晚会分手
Because when that inevitable breakup comes,

54
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,630
到时你也可以省得买新的了
you don't want to buy new mugs.

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,010
所以不管跟谁谈恋爱
That's why I've never thrown anything out

56
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,710
我从来不扔东西
for any relationship ever.

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,260
没错吧  亲爱的
Isn't that right, honey?

58
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,060
哎呦  没错  我是单身
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.

59
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,770
莉莉  你听我解释
Lily, here's the thing.

60
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,930
那是我家
It's my apartment,

61
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,820
作为男人  我要维护自己的统治权
and I need to assert my dominance as a man.

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,460
千万不要对女人
Don't ever say that...

63
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,100
说这种话
to any girl ever.

64
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,030
已经晚了
Too late.

65
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,700
你刚跟我说什么
What did you just say to me?

66
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,440
-她为了你连家都不要了  -亏你说得出口
- She gave up her apartment for you! - You said that to her?!

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,530
我受够了
Okay, you know what?

68
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,130
我没必要坐在着让你们女人讨伐
I don't have to sit here and take this from you ladies.

69
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,550
我要去泰德家了
I'm going to Ted's.

70
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,860
男人的地盘
The man cave,

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,680
可以随心所欲做自己
where guys can be guys.

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,850
-维护你的统治权  -你懂不懂尊重女人啊
- Assert your dominance? - It's like you have no respect for women.

73
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,590
-你脑子进水啦  -你可是女人生的啊
- What is wrong with you? - You have a mother!

74
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,380
怎么连你们也这样
You guys, too?

75
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,150
我要去舒缓一下我郁闷的心情
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.

76
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,730
别  哥们  慢着
No, dude, hold on.

77
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,350
你哪儿也不准去
You're not going anywhere.

78
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,790
今天是星战三部曲时间
It's trilogy time.

79
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,980
{\an2}{\pos(192,260)}卫斯理大学
 
2000年

80
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,640
<i>星战三部曲时间的由来是这样的</i>
</i>Kids, here's the deal with trilogy time:</i>

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
</i>故事发生在很久以前</i>
</i>It all started a long time ago</i>

82
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,570
</i>在一间遥远的男生寝室里</i>
</i>in a dorm room far, far away.</i>

83
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,110
哥们  咱们期末要是经济学挂了
Dude, if we fail this econ final,

84
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,980
那下半辈子就别想...
for the rest of our lives we're not gonna be able to...

85
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,500
咱们就不知道该怎么...
We won't know how to...

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,410
你知道经济学是什么吗
Do you even know what econ is?

87
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,210
一头雾水  咱们死定了
No idea. We're screwed.

88
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,220
在这种窘境之下  只有一件事可做
But there's only one thing left to do at at time like this.

89
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,850
一口气看完《星球大战》三部曲
Watch the entire Star Wars trilogy all the way through

90
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,830
因为我五年没这么干过了
because I haven't done that in, like, five years.

91
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,350
哥们  你不能这么堕落
Dude, you can't let that happen.

92
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,050
你起码要每隔三年就要看一遍
If you're not trilling it at least once every three years,

93
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,440
不然黑暗面就要获胜了
the Dark Side wins.

94
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,590
好  那我们做个约定吧
Okay, let's make a pact.

95
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,770
无论如何  每隔三年
No matter what, every three years,

96
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,070
我们都要一起看一遍三部曲
we sit down and trill it up big time.

97
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,220
同意吗
Agreed?

98
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,100
同意[格里多]
A-Greedo.

99
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,100
{\an8}格里多 《星球大战》中的赏金猎人

100
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,910
2003年
2003, I mean...

101
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,720
那时的我们会怎么样呢
What's that gonna be like?

102
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,260
《都市日报》
总统戈尔签署一个历史性的议案

103
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,670
泰德
Hey, Ted.

104
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,570
发型不错
Sweet hair.

105
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,790
我告诉过你  我的头发总有一天会停止自然卷
I told you it would eventually stop growing out

106
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,440
并变得长发飘飘
and start growing down.

107
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,080
话说  我现在执笔设计另一栋摩天大楼
Anyway, I'm just working on designing yet another skyscraper.

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,620
而我现在手提公文包
And I'm carrying this briefcase

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,960
因为我现在是个成功的律师
because now I'm a successful lawyer...

110
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,400
我喜欢这剧情
I like that.

111
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,390
我能做个改动吗
Can I make one adjustment?

112
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,630
并留着威武的小胡子
...with a cool mustache.

113
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,210
漂亮
Nice.

114
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,490
谁知道呢  到那时
And who knows, by then,

115
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,140
你和莉莉说不定都订婚了
you and Lily might be engaged.

116
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,160
订婚
Engaged?

117
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,750
兄弟  我一定会更胜一筹
Bro, I'm gonna do way better than that.

118
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,000
怀孕真是太有意思了
Ah, being pregnant is so much fun.

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,280
我还想再生四个孩子
I want to do this four more times.

120
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
宝贝  自从我能
Oh, baby, how do you feel after

121
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,730
挣大钱养家糊口
spending all day working on your art,

122
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,740
你整天窝在家里创作艺术后  感觉如何
since I make enough to support us both financially?

123
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,140
欲求不满
Horny.

124
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,820
我希望你别介意  泰德
I hope we don't bother you, Ted,

125
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,900
因为即便我们结了婚  有了娃
because even though we're married and pregnant,

126
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,330
还睡成人双层床  也很合情合理嘛
it still makes sense that we all share adult-sized bunk beds.

127
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,020
想看《星球大战》吗
So, Star Wars?

128
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,130
当然  我可以傍晚才去上班
Sure, I don't have to be at work until late afternoon-ish

129
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,980
因为我老板不介意我
because my boss appreciates that

130
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,620
通宵喝酒  还...
I like to stay up late drinking and...

131
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,480
跟我们的乐队一起玩摇滚
rocking out with our band.

132
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,270
有人刚说玩摇滚吗
Did someone say rocking out?

133
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,680
哇  那个靓妞是谁
Whoa, who's the babe?

134
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,250
这正是最棒的部分
That's the best part.

135
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,170
伙计们  你们还记得我的超辣女友吧
Guys, you remember my awesome girlfriend

136
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,980
在遇见我之前  一直都守身如玉哦
who was a virgin until we met?

137
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,320
我叫赖安娜
My name's Rhiannon,

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,180
就像史蒂薇·尼克斯歌里唱的
like the Stevie Nicks song.

139
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,840
我虽性感  但是绿色环保的森女型
I'm hot, but in a crunchy, earthy kind of way.

140
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,220
忘说了  我是英国人哟
Oh, and I'm from England.

141
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,060
真不错
Nice.

142
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,880
好了  该看《星球大战》了
Okay, Star Wars time.

143
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,050
但首先  我们即兴来一曲吧
But first, we jam.

144
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,840
幸好我前三年有花时间
Good thing I spent the last three years

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,090
练习用耍酷刷吉他
learning to wail on guitar.

146
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,130
宝贝
Babe.

147
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,100
我们乐队的表演将供不应求
Yup, our band is gonna be in demand.

148
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,670
幸好  我们有求必应
And luckily, there'll be plenty of supply.

149
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,740
"供"给  需"求"
Supply? Demand?

150
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,690
伙计  你有注意到我们的用词吗
Dude, do you realize what we just did?

151
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,540
我们居然用到经济学
We used econ.

152
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,710
期末考我们肯定名列前茅
We're gonna ace this final.

153

162
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,740
那你准备好观看星战三部曲了吗
So, you ready to watch the trilogy?

163
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,910
不知道
I don't know.

164
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,800
我之前真以为  现在的我会成为一名律师
I mean, I really thought that by now I'd be a lawyer

165
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,580
还留着威武的小胡子
with a kick-ass mustache,

166
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,210
可我现在还没考进法学院
but I still haven't even gotten into law school,

167
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,470
而且胡子长得参差不齐
and my facial hair just grows in patchy.

168
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,580
又红又散
Just red and patchy.

169
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,620
别不爽了  你的生活没那么糟
Come on. Your life's not that bad.

170
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,270
伙计  我在班尼路当店长
Dude, I manage a Structure.

171
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,270
{\an8}Structure现名为Express Men's
Victoria's Secre旗下的男士休闲品牌  价位类似美国的班尼路

172
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,550
但你买背心可以打九折  相当不错了
But you get 10% off vests. That's something.

173
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,000
-那些背心是还不错  可...  -对啊
- The vests are pretty sweet, but, look... - Yeah.

175

莉莉也没怀有孩子
We don't have a baby on the way.

176
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,370
至少我们现在的住处不错
But we did get the cool apartment.

177
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,300
可我们根本住不起
That we can barely afford.

178
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,160
我是说  现在的生活
I mean, I don't see any way that our lives

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,890
比三年前的好不到哪儿去
are better now than they were three years ago.

180
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,950
真的吗  马修  再仔细想想
Oh, really, Marshall? Nothing comes to mind?

181
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,920
对了  伙计们  这位是丽莎

以后你们会常常见到她的

185
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,780
好吧
Okay,

186
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,180
三年前  我们满怀希冀
three years ago, we had this whole fantasy

187
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,680
幻想我们日后的生活会变得多棒
about how great our lives were gonna be,

188
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,730
可事实不尽如人意
and it didn't pan out.

189
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,920
但我告诉你  三年后
But I'm telling you, three years from now,

190
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,280
当我们在2006年看星战三部曲时
when we're watching the trilogy in 2006,

191
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,850

我现在是一名环境律师
I'm an environmental lawyer now.

195
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,250
当然  这个领域不能赚大钱
Sure, it's not the most lucrative field,

196
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,480
可幸运的是  我在《幸运之轮》
but luckily I have the cash and prizes

离你父母近点的地方住
down the street from your parents

206
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,830
这样我们能多跟你母亲亲近
so we can be close to your mom,

207
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,750
而且我现在跟她超合得来哟

人家不会因为我设计了这个歌剧院
Just because I designed the opera house

212
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,560
就非得等我们到场后才开演
doesn't mean they'll hold the curtain for us.

213
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,890
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

214
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,070
他们一定会等的
Of course it does.

215
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,090

而且我们还住在一起  也合情合理
And it still makes sense that we all live together.

221
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,280
你呢  巴尼
What about you, Barney?

对2006年有期许吗

那和你现在的生活有什么区别啊
How is that any different from your life right now?

229

没区别  我是肯德基  宝贝

但辣妹可以轮着换
but with a different hottie.

233
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,090
因为巴尼绝不吃回头妞
'Cause Barney don't slurp no sloppy seconds,

234

我当初就说你会进的

看  情况也没那么糟
See, things aren't so bad.

要跟你"干"一些淘气的事
naughty things you and I are gonna do

250
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,820
好让马修振作起来

251
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,310

Like what?

252

我从未想过要结婚
I never thought I would get married,

270

可你说服了我
but you talked me into it.

271
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,690
更确切地说  是你"睡"服了我

你的床上功夫棒极了

我都不晓得到底更喜欢他哪点
I don't know what I love more:

287
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,210
是浓密的胡子
his thick mustache

288
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,410
还是他的潮帽
or his trucker hat.

289
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,500
你知道我讨厌那种帽子

改变一下你一成不变的生活吗
that you'd like the future to be different.

305
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,700
倒是想改变一件事
I guess there is one thing.

306
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,820
各位  这是玛雅
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

307
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,770
以后你们会常常见到她的
You'll be seeing a lot more of Maya.

308
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,900
不是因为她胸前的雄伟
And not because of these these.

309
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,660
而是因为背后也雄伟
Because of these.

310
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,230
后胸  原本只属于传教士式的
Back boobs-- the visual stimulation

311
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,520
视觉刺激  在后入式时也能享受到了
of missionary meets the emotional detachment of doggy-style.

312
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,350
专利申请中
Patent pending.

313
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,380
帅吧
Whassaaaa!

314
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,980
马修  重点是
The point is, Marshall,

315
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,380
三年后的今天  万事会更好
this time in three years, everything is gonna be great.

316
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,860
{\an8}{\pos(192,200)} 
(现实情况)

317
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,140
瞧  莉莉回来了
See? Lily came back.

318
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,170
当然了  我和罗宾最后还是分手了
Of course, Robin and I didn't end up together.

319
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,600
但我确实有个未婚妻
But I did get engaged.

320
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,520
可惜她最后一秒落跑了
And left at the altar.

321
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,910
我还开了自己的建筑公司
But I did start my own architectural firm.

322
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,420
可惜两个月后倒闭了
And it failed after a few months.

323
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,680
-能把电影放起吗  -好
- Can we put the movie on, please? - Yeah.

324
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,690
当然可以
Sure, buddy.

325
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,680
对了  罗宾呢
Hey, by the way, where is Robin?

326
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,340
<i>在2009年的夏天</i>
<i>In the summer of 2009,</i>

327
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,710
<i>巴尼和罗宾在搞地下恋情</i>
<i>Barney and Robin were secretly dating.</i>

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,220
巴尼说罗宾在上剪纸补习班
Barney said she's taking some extension class in how to decoupage,

329
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,800
巴尼也在同一栋楼里  上另一个剪纸补习班
and Barney's taking a different decoupage class in the same building.

330
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,890
所以他们有次一次打车回来
That's why they shared that cab that one time.

331
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,080
<i>当年我们真是白痴</i>
<i>We were idiots.</i>

332
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,550
等一下
Wait a minute.

333
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,900
你说巴尼·斯丁森在上剪纸补习班啊
You're saying that Barney Stinson is at a decoupage class?

334
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,210
那我们可以用他的大电视来看《星球大战》啦
That means we can watch Star Wars on his giant TV!

335
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,670
冲啊  老兄
Punch it, Chewy!

336
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,870
你从剪纸班回来了
You're back from decoupage.

337
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,360
什么剪纸班
What's decoupage?

338
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,990
对  我在那里打过一次车
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that cab there that one time.

339
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,350
等等
Hold on.

340
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,590
进来
Come on in.

341
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,500
我们能不能在这里看星战三部曲
We were hoping we could watch the trilogy here.

342
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,680
没问题  不过...
Uh, sure. But, uh...

343
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,530
先去我卧室的窗户往外看
first go look out my, uh, bedroom window.

344
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,410
有个...
There's a, uh...

345
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,790
裸女...
naked lady, uh...

346
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,800
在迷你弹簧床上乱蹦...
jumping up and down on a mini-trampoline

347
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,240
那间公寓就在...
in the apartment across the, uh...

348
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,420
对面街
street.

349
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,520
让我出来
Get me out of this thing!

350
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,890
没时间啊
There's no time!

351
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,730
巴尼  我还没准备好公开关系
Barney, I am not ready for them to find out about us.

352
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,270
那你就得乖乖待到三部曲播完啦
Then you're gonna have to stay in there for the entire trilogy.

353
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,710
别担心  才六个小时二十二分而已
Don't worry. It's only 382 minutes.

354
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,920
死阿宅
Nerd!

355
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,050
大家觉得  三年后我们会如何
So, where do you guys think we'll be in three years?

356
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
到时就是2012年了
It'll be 2012.

357
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,610
很简单啊
That's an easy one.

358
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,000
各位  这是索菲娅
Guys, this is Sophia.

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,910
以后你们会常常...
You'll be seeing a lot more of...

360
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
太神奇了
Okay, that is so weird.

361
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,030
我刚试着想用一下星战里的原力
I was just trying to use the force.

362
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,380
会不会是我的原力没让啤酒
Do you think instead of making a beer

363
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,500
从冰箱里飞出来  却让这个灯摔碎了啊
fly out of the fridge, I made that lamp break??

364
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,670
不是你的原力  就是风暴兵弄的了
Either that or the stormtrooper did.

365
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,420
帝国风暴兵才不会那么做
Oh, the stormtrooper would never do that.

366
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,880
他知道那个灯价值一千二
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.

367
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,550
对了  既然都是自己人
Anyway, while it's just us guys,

368
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,780
我问你们一点事
let me ask you something:

369
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,650
我们都幻想过和穿着
we've all had that same fantasy

370
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,710
风暴兵服的女人上床  对吧
in a stormtrooper costume, right?

371
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,230
-没  -从来没有
- Mmm, no. - Never.

372
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,180
兄弟们
Guys...

373
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,500
周围没有女人  就我们几兄弟
come on, no girls around, just us bros.

374
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,850
直说无妨
Safe space.

375
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,810
放下虚伪  实话实说
Let's stop being polite and start gettin' real.

376
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,120
风暴兵的性幻想
Stormtrooper fantasy.

377
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,160
每个男人都幻想过  对吧
Every guy's had that one, right?

378
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
-没想过  -没有没有
- Not even once, no. - No, no, no.

379
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,610
那我才是怪胎吗
So I'm the weird one?

380
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,890
-对  -对
- Yeah. - Yeah.

381
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,410
没错
Yeah.

382
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,290
你呢  泰德
How about you, Ted?

383
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,600
三年后  你的生活
How's your life gonna be different

384
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,430
会有什么不同
in, whatever, three years?

385
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,660
和以前一样
Oh, you know, the usual.

386
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,620
遇见真爱  结婚生子
Gonna meet a nice girl and get married.

387
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,100
虽说我每年都老生常谈  不过
I mean, I know I say that every year, but...

388
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,050
老实说  2012年我就满34岁了
let's be honest, in 2012, I'll be 34.

389
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,030
如果到时候我还没结婚
If it still hasn't happened for me by then,

390
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,160
肯定是我这人自身的毛病了
something is seriously wrong with me!

391
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,170
{\an8}{\pos(192,230)} 
(现实情况)

392
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,030
肯定是我这人自身的毛病了
Something is seriously wrong with me.

393
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,750
我不能再这么继续下去了
I can't do this anymore.

394
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,320
我不能在
I can't keep smiling

395
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,010
所有证据都指向相反面时
and being optimistic all the time

396
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,250
还面带微笑  假装乐观了
when all the evidence points to the contrary.

397
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,440
你真心认为三年以后
You really think that three years from now

398
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
情况不会变得更好吗
things aren't gonna be awesome?

399
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,370
让我来告诉你
I'll tell you what things are gonna be like

400
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,120
三年之后的情形吧
three years from now.

401
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,200
你好
Uh, yes, hello. I see

402
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,760
我从冷冻食品上看到可以打这个号码
on my frozen entree for one they printed this number

403
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,100
发表我的评论和意见
where I can voice comments and concerns.

404
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,490
这盒酥皮水果馅饼里的肉桂  比平时放得多
Well, there's more cinnamon in the cobbler than usual.

405
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,620
不  我挺喜欢肉桂的
No, I like cinnamon.

406
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,300
没事  这是我应该做的
Oh, you're very welcome for my comment.

407
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,820
等等  别挂电话
Wait! Uh, don't go.

408
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,310
那个...  你喜欢肉桂吗
Um... do you like cinnamon?

409
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,360
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

410
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,860
马修  你想一起看《星球大战》吗
Marshall, you want to watch Star Wars?

411
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,550
抱歉  来不了了  老兄
No, can do, old bean!

412
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,990
我们正在鳕鱼角附近航行呢
You see, we're up on the Cape

413
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,710
{\an8}美国东北部马萨诸塞州伸入大西洋的一个半岛

414
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,710
过着你憧憬已久的
living the idyllic family lifestyle

415
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,970
田园式的生活哦
that you've always dreamed of.

416
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,970
我又怀上了第五个宝宝啦
Oh, and I'm pregnant with baby #5!

417
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,580
你的第四个宝宝还在肚子里呢
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.

418
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,850
哥就是这么霸气
I'm just that good!

419
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,800
等一下
Oh, oh, hold on.

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
还有人想跟你打招呼
There's somebody wants to say hello to you.

421
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,740
你好啊  泰德
Hey, Ted.

422
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,880
我要说的是  一切都好极了
I just wanted to say that things are great,

423
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,460
我和那个潮帽的人渣结婚了
and I'm married to that douchey guy in the trucker hat.

424
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,910
你好啊  哥们儿
Whassup, bra?

425
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,560
原来除了你之外
It turns out it was just you

426
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,510
我和谁都愿意步入婚姻
I didn't want to commit to.

427
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,540
而且我也有后胸了哦
and I got back boobs.

428
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,990
真是幸福美满呀
So things are great!

429
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,410
回见啰
Buh-bye!

430
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,980
对了  泰德  这位是梅勒妮
By the way, Ted, this is Melanie.

431
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,890
以后你们会常常见到她的
You'll be seeing a lot more of Melanie.

432
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,360
等  等  等一下
Wait-wait-wait a minute!

433
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,440
梅勒妮是谁啊
Who is Melanie?

434
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,540
得了吧  巴尼  我唯一坚信
Come on, Barney, if there's one thing

435
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,260
不会改变的事
I can count on not to change,

436
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,740
就是你搂着陌生女孩走出来
it's you walking in with some random girl on your arm.

437
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,700
不  不  我才不要这样
No. No, I don't want that.

438
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,890
人生头一次
For the first time in my life,

439
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,440
我不愿意看到自己三年后
I don't want to find myself

440
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,570
还游荡在花丛中
in three years with some random girl,

441
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,770
不管这"花"长了几颗大胸
no matter how many boobs she has.

442
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,990
我只想跟昆茵在一起
I want to be with Quinn.

443
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,430
各位
Guys...

444
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,080
以后你们会常常见到昆茵的
you're gonna be seeing a lot more of Quinn.

445
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
兄弟  我们去过情欲小野猫舞厅
Dude, we've been to the Lusty Leopard.

446
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,430
早就全"见"光了
We've seen plenty.

447
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,670
我真是挖坑往里跳  好  回见
I kind of walked into that one. All right, bye-bye.

448
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,140
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

449
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,330
我们同居了  我很开心
We're living together, I'm excited about it,

450
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,310
所以我要丢掉我的杯子
and I'm getting rid of my mugs.

451
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,740
那是我的杯子
That was mine.

452
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,020
抱歉  我分不清哪只是我的  哪只是你的
Sorry. I don't know which are which.

453
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
实话实说  我从没在家泡过咖啡
Truth is, I never drink coffee at home.

454
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,640
这支是我的吗
This one?

455
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,450
好
There!

456
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,680
我不需要自己的杯子  因为我有你的
I don't need my coffee mugs 'cause I got yours!

457
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,330
下半辈子都用你的
For the rest of my life.

458
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,430
或直到...你不要我的那一天
Or as... long as you'll have me.

459
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,860
我们还没认真讨论过未来
We haven't really talked about the future.

460
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,710
我是不是把事情弄得尴尬了
Did I make things awkward?

461
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,650
继续摔你的杯子吧
Just keep smashing mugs.

462
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,840
也可以把它们捐了
Or donate them.

463
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,240
问题是
Point is,

464
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,340
我打算和你长相厮守
I plan on being with you for a long time.

465
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,210
你对此有意见吗
You okay with that?

466
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,410
听起来还不错
Sounds great.

467
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,920
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

468
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,790
没关系  挺好的
No, no, it's great.

469
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,480
男人就先"放"开啊
A guy has to be the first one to let 'er rip.

470
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,510
其实我一直希望这事早点发生
I was actually hoping this would happen soon.

471
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,050
我都躲在阳台上悄悄放屁好几周了
I've been crop-dusting the patio for weeks.

472
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,960
阳台呀
The patio!

473
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,830
我都是去街上
I've been going out on the street,

474
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,690
每天晚上  就在这个时间
like, exactly this time every night.

475
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,290
金发男  你在哪里
Where are you, blond man?!

476
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,680
快快现身
Show yourself!

477
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,590
我回娘家了
I will be at my mother's.

478
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,000
我们现在是真正的情侣了  对吧
We're a real couple now, aren't we?

479
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,180
没错
We are.

480
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,680
兄弟  我知道你很沮丧
Hey, buddy, I get that you're bummed.

481
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,560
可我预感2015会有好事发生
But I got a good feeling about 2015.

482
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,440
那一定会是"泰德年"
I think that's gonna be your year.

483
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,280
<i>孩子们  那是我唯一一次对于</i>
<i>Kids, that was the one time I ever lost faith</i>

484
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,610
<i>"未来三年我会过得更好"这件事失去信心</i>
<i>in the idea that my life would be better in three years.</i>

485
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,690
<i>有趣的是  三年之后</i>
<i>And what's funny is, three years from that moment,</i>

486
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,400
<i>我的人生变得妙不可言</i>
<i>my life was amazing.</i>

487
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,780
{\an8}(现实情况)

488
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,480
好  又到三部曲时刻了
All right! It's trilogy time!

489
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,840
我能发表一下抗议吗
Can I just lodge one complaint?

490
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,140
这可是我们男子汉的传统
This is a guy's tradition.

491
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,670
泰德居然带个妞来  大煞风景啊
It's kind of a lame move on Ted's part to bring a chick.

492
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,320
算了  放过他吧
Come on, dude... cut him some slack.

493
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,660
我明白  他深爱着她
I know. He loves her.

494
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,420
而且她也太他妈可爱了吧
And I'll give him this: she is pretty damn cute.

495
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,690
幸好她长相随她妈
Thank God she takes after her mother.

496
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,150
好  开播吧
All right, let's watch this thing!

497
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,010
电视机
TV...

498
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,900
播放星战三部曲
play Star Wars trilogy.

499
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,170
播放星战三部
Play Star Wars tril...

500
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,490
算了  不试了
You know what? Screw it.

501
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,050
你即将看到画面  很精彩哟
Okay, you are about to see something awesome.

502
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,830
而且记住
And just know this:

503
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,330
是韩先开枪
Han shot first.

504
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,330
{\an8}星球大战中  韩·索罗与格里多在剧中谁先开枪
曾出现过3个版本  各有支持者

505
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,690
我很好奇  等2018年再看三部曲时
I wonder if things'll be a lot different

506
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,530
情况会不会变得大不一样
when we watch the trilogy again in 2018.

507
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
我希望一切不要变
I hope not.

508
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,600
爽翻天啊
Oh, that was awesome.

509
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,880
-你说得对  一点都不奇怪  -是的
- You were right-- not weird. - No.
