哇哦 那可是违规操作
Well,this is most irregular.

17
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:04,768
难道我们不是在做生意?
Are we doing business,or what?

18

象我常说的那样 我总是能得到我想要的
Like I said,I usually get what I want.

19
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,885

All I'm saying is,you know,if I was a bird,well,I'd shag me.

28
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,010
瞧你说的
Can you hear yourself?

29
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,568
我就说 她绝对是个同性恋 不是嘛?
I reckon she's gotta be a lesbian,ain't she?

30
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,086
就因为她让你吃瘪了?
Just because she knocked you back?

31
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:41,165
听着 伙计 我没有吃瘪 懂吗?
Listen,mate,I don't get knocked back,okay?

32
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:45,883
我说..她们不是同姓恋就是性冷淡
Unless they're either A:Lesbian,or B:Frigid.

33
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,089
- 或者 两者都是 - 没错

也许 他们相处的很好

36
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,765
拜托 相处的好又怎样?也许下一个会更好呢?
Mate,happy,so what?Why go for second best?

37
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,289

Mick,straight off,okay?

00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:00,445

41
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,288
不会
No.

42
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,526
好吧 因为你也是个同性恋
Well,that's because you'd be a lesbian.

43
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,127
Stacie 我们工作室怎么样了?

44
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:16,891
呃 还行 怎么啦?

00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,569
<i>作为他无能及管理不善的"回报"</i>

So you became firm friends?

64
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:17,568

别担心 亲爱的...
Don't worry,my dear...

69
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:32,252
我觉得我们可以利用第二个
it's the second little vice I think we should use.

70
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,368
什么?
Which is?

71
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,523
我问他借阅报纸的时候发现的

78
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,086
老把戏了 19世纪前使用的
It's an old-time scam,it's pre-1900.

79
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,324
跑马结果是由通过 美国的西方联合电报电话公司
Racing results used to go from east to west...

80
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,404
从东部传达到西部的
by Western Union telegraph.

81
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,484
你所需要做的就是 使人相信
All you had to do was convince the mark...

82
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,690
你能够在下注前 通过内部线报
that you had someone on the inside who could delay the results...

83
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,411
获悉比赛的结果

Ash 我们可以操作吗?
Ash,can we make it work?

87
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,212
可以 不过 现在大家都在看时实比赛
Yeah,but everyone watches races live these days.

88
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,363
- 是的 但不是在家看 - 是啊
- Yeah,but not in person. - No.

89
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,484
我想 原则上还是有机可趁的
The principle still holds good,I suppose.

90
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,246
用录象替代原来的信号就可以
Just have to use video link instead of telegraph.

91
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,368
Albert
Albert?

92
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,206

97
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,524
不好意思 伙计 没听说过
Sorry,mate,never heard of him.

98
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,963
如果你有幸遇到这个人的话
On the off chance you meet him in the next few days...

99
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:22,092
可否替我把这个转交给他?
could you give him this for me?

100
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:31,763
当然 没问题 如果结果是4的话 你就得带我们参观伦敦了
Yeah,okay,if it said 4,I say you gave us a tour of London.

你打赌又赢了
You've got a chip on your shoulder.

103
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,172
你该输一回 否则你总是自我感觉太好
You should lose it,or you'll always feel on the outside.

104
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,403
有必要吗?我一直都是很优秀的
What's new?I've been on the outside all my life.

105
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,723
在一个精英团队里 这种感觉会成为一种反作用
In a good crew,that will make you a liability.

106
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,122
- 我知道 - 那就好好处理
- I know that. - Then deal with it.

107
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,004
在这儿用午餐吗 Winstone先生?
Will you be lunching with us,Mr.Winstone?

108
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:57,290
不 谢谢 我和同事还有些事要谈
No,thank you,my colleague and I have some business to discuss.

109
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,329
- 图书馆正空着呢 - 太好了
- The library is free. - Lovely.

110
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,405
你怎么能记得住那么多不同的名字?
How do you remember all your names?

111
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:03,562
我不需要记住
I don't need to.

112
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,611
这样的地方 记住客人的名字 是他们的工作
In places like this,it's their job to remember them.

113
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,571
那是铁定赢的 James叔叔
This is a guaranteed winner,Uncle James.

114
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:39,723
你一定要相信我说的
You have just got to take my word on it.

115
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:43,249
我知道你说的没错 孩子 可是 我不喜欢赌博
I'm sure you're right,dear boy,but I'm afraid I don't gamble.

116
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,610
Anthony 还以为你躲起来了呢
Anthony,I thought you'd be in hiding.

117
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,207
真是无聊
Nasty business.

118
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,204
是那些无知大众的错
That's the problem with the great unwashed.

119
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,363
他们眼红那些赚大钱的人
They hate to see a fellow make a few pounds.

120
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,889
忘了介绍 Anthony 这是Peter 故友之子
I'm sorry,Anthony,this is Peter,the son of a very old friend of mine.

121
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,406
- 您好 先生 - 你好
- How do you do,sir? - How do you do?

122
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,643
Anthony最近被报社弄得焦头烂额
Anthony's having a bit of trouble with the press.

123
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,201
开玩笑 那帮市井之徒 不值一提
You're joking.They are scumbags,aren't they?

124
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,567
你也曾经遇到过麻烦?
You've had dealings with them?

125
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,372
我自己 没有 先生 几年前 我父亲有过类似经历
Not personally,sir.My dad did,a few years back.

126
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,648
他是个反欧洲运动的积极分子
He was an activist in the anti-Euro campaign.

127
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,485
- 媒体的焦点人物 - 是吗?
- Press were all over him. - Really?

128
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,087
行了 还是忘了吧 Peter Anthony 要一起聊聊吗?
Now,best forgotten,Peter.Anthony,won't you join us?

129
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,845
来 坐这儿吧 先生 我正要走
Here,take my seat,sir,I'm just off.

130
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,332
不用这么做
No need on my account.

131
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,849
不是的 事实上 我突然造访 是想给James叔叔一些内部消息
No,really,I only popped in here to make Uncle James a few quid.

132
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,208
不过 跟过去一样 他并不感兴趣
But as ever,he weren't interested.

133
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,807
人各有志 孩子 人各有志
Horses for courses,dear boy.

134
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,403
总之 下次再聊 很高兴认识您 先生
Anyway,we'll talk later.Nice to meet you,sir.

135
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:28,482
再见 James叔叔
Goodbye,Uncle James.

136
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,006
替我问候你的母亲
Say hello to your mother for me.

I will,definitely.Bye-bye.

138
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,769
年轻的时候 被认为是个不肖之子

139
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:38,287
后来却浪子回头 是个非常不错的年轻人

- 马? - 你知道 就是那种比赛之类的

有"小道消息" 或是 他们称为的那种消息

00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,088
要知道 Anthony 笨蛋是发不了大财的
But just as well,Anthony.A fool and his money are soon parted.

149
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,048

- 好了? - 是啊

00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:22,367
你得以我为傲 我是个很不错的成员
You'd have been proud of me.I was a real team player.

154
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,731
你真坦白 Danny
Your round,Danny.

155
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:34,211
你好 我想知道上一场是谁赢了?
Hello.I was wondering if you could tell me what won the last race?

156
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,052
随便哪个比赛
Anywhere.

157
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,088
很好 非常感谢
That's excellent.Thank you.

158
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,163
我听说你被某个女人拒绝了?
I heard you got blanked by some bird at the hotel.

159
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:53,326
我没有被拒绝好不好?她是个同性恋
I did not get blanked,okay?She's a lesbian.

160
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:54,562
是的 没错
Right.

161
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,928
早些时候 有个家伙来这儿找你
Had some bloke in here earlier,looking for you.

162
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,362
谁?
What bloke?

163
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:04,685
没留名字 不过他好象留了电话号码
He didn't leave his name,but he left his number here somewhere.

164
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,762
看上去有点道理啊 就是你说的
It seems it's true,what you say.

165
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,005
笨蛋是发不了财的
About a fool and his money.

166
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,928
这上面说有个家伙
There's a chap in here.

167
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,523
他被骗 据说是他竟然以为 自己买到了"伦敦眼"
He was apparently conned into believing he was buying the London Eye.

168
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,523
{\an8}伦敦眼:世界最大的观景摩天轮

169
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:30,602
是吗?
Really?

170
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,491
显然他太想得到它了
Apparently turned up to take possession.

171
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,610
- 他到底在想什么? - 谁知道呢
- What was he thinking of? - I can't imagine.

172
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,042
谢谢!
Thank you.

173
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,091
问题是 有些人不该拥有那么多钱
Problem is,some people don't deserve money.

174
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,845
象我们这样的人 稍有点钱
When chaps like us earn a few bob...

175
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,725
就被说成中饱私囊
they call us fat cats.

176
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,684
象我 即使有人中了彩票 我也不会嫉妒的
I mean,I don't moan when one of the plebs wins the lottery,do I?

177
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,764
我就没你那么大度了
I could hardly put it better myself.

178
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,731
当然 希望他不会成为我的邻居
Providing he doesn't move in next to me,of course.

179
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,171
Margo's girl
Margo's Girl.

180
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:05,928
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

181
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:09,562
你刚刚问我马的名字 是Margo's Girl 下午1点的
That horse you asked me about,Margo's Girl,1:00 p.m.

182
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,206
突然间想起来了
It just came back to me.

183
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:12,772
哪场比赛 你知道吗?
Where was it running,do you know?

184
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,684
我不清楚
I have no idea.

185
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,007
我想知道它有没有赢?
I wonder if it won?

186
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,288
想知道结果 那很简单
It's easy enough to find out.

187
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,809
Paul 有匹马叫Margo's Girl 参加今天的某场比赛
Paul,there was a horse running today,Margo's Girl.

188
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,805
可以替我看看结果如何吗?
Could you see how it did for me,there's a good chap.

189
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,246
- 要是真赢了 你就该后悔了 - 我不沾赌的
- You'll be sick if it won. - I never gamble.

190
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,642
偶尔的一两次刺激 无伤大雅
There's nothing wrong with an occasional flutter.

191
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,928
我对赛马是一窍不通
I don't know one end of the horse from the other.

192
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,924
那可是"运动之王" 老伙计
It's the sport of kings,old chap.

193
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,208
看着你的马跑向Cheltenham的山顶
You haven't lived till you've seen your horse...

194
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,204
你才会觉得生活是如此有意义
running up that hill at Cheltenham.

195
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,409
我会记得你说的
I'll have to take your word for it.

196
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,004
Margo's Girl赢了 先生
Margo's Girl won,sir.

197
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,724
- 赔率? - 1赔12

198
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,332
真不错
Good Lord.

199
00:11:57,053 --> 00:12:01,808
你的这个故友之子 他到底是做什么的?
This nephew of yours,what does he do exactly?

200
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:05,249
说实话 我也不清楚 只知道是关于马的
Tell you the truth,I'm not sure.Just something to do with horses.

201
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,688
我很希望有机会再见见他
I'd very much like to meet him again.

202

The name's Ray Fordham.

207
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,366
你有他们说的那么厉害吗 Danny?
Are you as good as they say you are,Danny?

208
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,131
你到底是谁?警察?
What are you then?Cop?

209
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,884
我看上去象警察吗?
Do I look like a cop?

210
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,328
警察长什么样的都有 不是嘛?
Well,they come in all shapes and sizes,don't they?

214
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,287
你就是苏格兰的Ray?你又不是苏格兰人
You're Scottish Ray?But you ain't even Scottish.

215

before we start feeding it through the front.

280
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,406
就所有人而言 他们是在看实况转播
As far as anyone is concerned,they're watching the race live.

281
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:32,642
2分钟时间并不长
Two minutes isn't very long.

282
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,089
再慢一点 我们的鱼儿就会有察觉了
You slow up the pictures any more,our man might smell a rat.

283
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,086
那也是逼不得已
It'll have to do.

284
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,483
好的主要区域已经布置好了
Right.The main area is fully functioning.

285
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,882
我从街灯上接了条线 作为我们的电力供应
I've tapped into a street light for electricity...

286
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:44,804
改了厕所的水流管道
re-routed mains water for the toilets.

287
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:46,804
只要他不踢墙....
As long as he doesn't kick the walls...

288
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:48,929
一切足够维持到任务结束
they should stay up long enough for the job.

289
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,241
完美的工作!
It's a work of art.

290
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,006
没错 我还找了20个小混混来做托
Yeah.I've got 20 grifters coming in as punters.

291
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,290
他们一来 这里就成"狼窝"了
When they're here,it will be the doggie's whatsits.

292
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,366
- 很好 明天我们就能开始 - 好的
- Okay,then we can start tomorrow. - Yeah.

293
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,843
我想说的是 你可以给我一些小道消息嘛
All I'm asking is that you throw the odd tip my way.

294
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,525
那超出了我的职权范围
It's more than my job's worth.

295
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:05,762
你告诉了James
You did it for James.

296
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:09,004
是的 但是他实质上就和家人一样 我的意思是 他能为我做任何事
Yeah,but he's virtually family.I mean,he'd do anything for me.

297
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:12,290
除了应有的尊重 先生 我几乎不了解你 是吧?
With all due respect,sir,I hardly even know you,do I?

298
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,125
James会为我担保的
James will vouch for me.

299
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:15,686
是吗?
Will he,now?

300
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,322
您是做什么?各种比赛 是吗?
So what are you?A racing man,are you?

301
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:22,291
我想 我该属于那种狂热的爱好者
I think I'm what you'd call an enthusiastic amateur.

302
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:28,842
听着 我要告诉你的事 不能让其他人知道
Listen,what I'm about to tell you mustn't go any further.

303
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,765
我保证!
You have my word.

304
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,723
我为syndicate工作
I work for a syndicate.

305
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,492
我们买比赛用的马
We buy racehorses.

306
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,848
我知道 你们有内部消息
I knew it.You've got inside knowledge.

307
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,252
有时候还不止这些
It's slightly more than that.

308
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:45,123
去年 我的东家和其他三家财团合作
Last year the company that I work for teamed up with three other syndicates.

309
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,922
去年 在Kempton 我们发现
Then at Kempton last year,we realized that between them...

310
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,649
他们拥有某一比赛中所有的马
they owned all the runners in a single race.

311
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,768
真的?
Really?

312
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,323
这样 他们所需要做的就是
From there it's just a short step to being able to determine...

313
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,291
决定哪一场次是哪匹马赢
which horses are going to win certain races.

314
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,842
你是说 暗箱操作?
You mean,fix them?

315
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,289
我没说是暗箱操作 我只是说 他们在比赛前就知道
I'm not saying fix them.I'm just saying they know who's going to win...

316
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,045
哪匹马会赢
before they start.

317
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,363
而你 可以知道获胜者的名字?
And you can get the names of the winning horses?

318
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:12,365
我?不 我只是个打工的
Me?No.I'm much too far down the food chain.

319
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,921
但是 你告诉过James马的名字
But the horse you told James about.

320
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:18,008
是的 我从Yvonne那儿知道的
Well,that came from Yvonne.

321
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:19,492
你的女朋友
Your girlfriend.

322
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,332
想知道原因吗?
Can I be honest with you?

323
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,369
- 当然 - 小声点
- Absolutely. - Come here.

324
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,251
听着 现在我完全信任你
Listen,I'm trusting you completely here.

325
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,449
我希望James叔叔没有看错你
I hope Uncle James ain't got you all wrong.

326
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,524
我保证 他没有
I can assure you he hasn't.

327
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,724
好吧 事实是...
Now,the truth is...

328
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:37,044
Yvonne和我不是真的在一起
Yvonne and me aren't really together.

329
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:41,931
她只是个高级公关 的确很吸引人
She's a high-class escort.Absolutely lovely.

330
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,966
我是说 每次我出席宴会都带着她
I mean,I take her out every now and again.

331
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:48,722
上周 我把她介绍给我的老板
Last week,I gave her number to my boss.

332
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,567
她和他在一起呆了会 并且偷听到他讲电话
She spends a bit of time with him.She overhears him talking on the phone.

333
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,042
现在 他已经对她完全着迷了
Now the thing is,he's got a bit of a crush on her.

334
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,249
他很想再见到她
So he wants to see her again.

335
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,687
可以理解
I don't blame him.

336
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:03,005
所以我在想 也许可以给更多人赚钱的机会
So,I gets to thinking maybe I can find out a few more winners.

337
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,406
我去找James叔叔 是因为 说实话 我没有足够的钱做本金
I went to Uncle James because,basically,I ain't got the funds to finance it.

338
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:09,926
所以 你打算找一个赞助者?
So you're looking for a backer?

339
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,766
当然 不然就不会跟你聊了
Well,we wouldn't be having this conversation if I weren't.

340
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,925
其实 上次我只筹到了1000块
I mean,the most I could raise last time was 1,000.

341
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:18,732
- 但是你赚了1万2 - 是的 没错
- But you got 12,000 back. - Well,yeah.

342
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,363
但是 假如我有1万的话呢?
But what if I had 10,000?

343
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,604
看上去 鱼儿已经咬钩了
Looks like we have a nibble.

344
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,007
我想 该对冰美人再次出击
I'm gonna have another crack at Frosty.

345
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:50,769
好吧 又得唠叨了
All right?Chatty as ever.

346
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,892
回见
See you.

347
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,285
嗨 不错的团队
Hey,that's quite a team.

348
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:05,612
Stacie Monroe Albert Stroller "三只脚"的Morgan...
Stacie Monroe,Albert Stroller,"Three Socks" Morgan...

349
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,207
还有 最厉害的Mickey Bricks
and the great Mickey Bricks.

350
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,806
你来这儿做什么?
What are you doing here?

351
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,088
我在想 你是否改变主意了
I just wondered if you'd made your mind up yet.

352
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,845
我们正在进行任务
We're in the middle of a score.

353
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,003
那么 你负责什么 Danny?
And what's your cut,Danny?

354
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,090
谁才是主角?
Who's calling the shots?

355
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:23,042
看看 你所做的就是 用你的天赋 为Mickey Bricks做嫁衣
See,all you're doing is using your talent to make Mickey Bricks look good.

356
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,609
扩大其声望
Big up his reputation.

357
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,404
我在跟他学习
I'm learning off him.

358
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,487
只要你在学 他就能一直拿你当猴耍
And as long as you're doing that,he'll treat you like a kid.

359
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,411
游戏该结束了 Danny
Clock's ticking,Danny.

360
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:37,047
没那么容易 我欠他们的
It ain't that easy.I owe them.

361
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:40,929
好吧 选择权在你 知道哪儿能找到我
Well,the choice is yours.You know where I am.

362
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:48,042
只有离开他们 你才能提升自己
You're never gonna move up in class,not until you break free.

363
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,327
准备好了?
All set?

364
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,768
你确定 下这些钱不会引起注意?
You're sure a bet of this size will go unnoticed?

365
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,084
听着 这是个私人的赛马俱乐部 有时候有的财团也会用
Listen,there's a private gambling club the syndicate uses sometimes.

366
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,322

367
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,881

370
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,044
都没有人眨过一下眼
No one even bats an eyelid.

371
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,603
只要我们坚持一天只赌一次 没有人会注意我们的
If we stick to one bet a day,no one's gonna notice us.

372
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:40,769
我会把上次赢的钱都拿来下注
I'm going to put in all my winnings from last time.

373

374
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:46,010
都知道你不会输了 为什么不呢?

375
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,961
去哪儿?
Where to?

这是我的会员卡
This is my card.

382
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,969
怎么会有这么个地方
You wouldn't even know this place was here.

00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,930
这里仅供会员进入
It's strictly members only.

384

让我感觉离狗仔队远远的
It gets me away from the damn press.

385
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,168
这里还能玩轮盘赌和二十一点
We've got roulette and blackjack through there.

386

能想象嘛 2万块钱 一眨眼就没了
Can you believe it?20,000,beaten by a neck.

387

下次我该压只长颈鹿
Next time remind me to back a giraffe.

388

423

424
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,769
Flak Jacket,1赔2

425
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,452

加油,小子

429
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,727
- 加快你的鞭子,孩子 - 他快了
- Get your whip out,boy. - He's coming.

430
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:40,729
就那样!去栏杆那里!
That's it!Go to the rail!

431
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:43,691
来吧,Flak Jacket!

432
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,408
给它们瞧瞧.来吧
Show them the way.Come on.

433
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,491
来吧,我的小子!耶!
Come on,my son!Yes!

434
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,969
我告诉过你什么?
What did I tell you?

435
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,006
漂亮
Beautiful.

436
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,568
你这个美丽的小东西
You little beauty.

437
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,887
还没有确认,先生
It hasn't been confirmed yet,sir.

438
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:32,522
就是4万8千,再加上你的赌金 一共是7万2千
That's 48,000,plus your stake.That's 72,000 in all.

439
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:36,125
2万,3万,4万...
20,000,30,000,40,000...

440
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:40,209
5万,6万,7万 还有...
50,000,60,000,70,000 and...

441
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,763
2千.请拿好,先生
2,000.Here we are,sir.

442
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,845
你们最大的赌注是多少,伙计?
What's your maximum bet,mate?

443
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,811
- 我们没有最高限制,先生 - 谢谢
- We have no maximum,sir. - Thank you.

444
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:04,648
我们再来一次
Let's do it again.

445
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,883
不,一天一场,我们说好的
No,one race a day.We agreed.

446
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:10,409
- 再来一次不会有什么问题的 - 我们会引起别人的注意
- One more won't make any difference. - We'll draw attention to ourselves.

447
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,131
现在走吧,好吗?
Now let's just go,okay?

448
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,812
Flak Jacket
Flak Jacket.

449
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,126
我不能相信就这么简单
I can't believe it was that easy.

450
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:25,125
你不愿相信我拿到那匹马的名字都要作些什么
You wouldn't believe what I had to do to get that horse's name.

451
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:26,646
我不知道
I don't know.

452
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,127
可是告诉告诉我
Try me.

453
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:32,246
听着,事情是这样的 如果我们想真的赚大钱...
Listen,the thing is,if we want to make real money...

454
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,530
我们就必须在Yvonne还在里面的时候 堵上一笔大的
we need to put one big bet on while Yvonne's still on the inside.

455
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,966
那不急,是不是?
There's no rush,surely?

456
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:40,841
好吧,如果他打电话给中介要求换个女孩呢?
Well,what if he calls the agency and asks for another girl?

457
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,647
他一定是疯了
He'd be mad.

458
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,293
不,Yvonne是对的 我们不想冒这个险
No,Yvonne's right.We don't want to take that risk.

459
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,807
总之,当这一切都结束的时候...
And anyway,when all this is over...

460
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,930
你们这两个多情鹦鹉就可以一起去过周末了,不是吗?
you two lovebirds get to spend the week together,don't you?

461
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,481
- 就像我许诺过的,Tony - 的确是
- Just as promised,Tony. - So we do.

462
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,047
你怎么想?
So what do you think?

463
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,328
他还要来赌一次小的,确定一下
He wants one more smaller bet,just to make sure.

464
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:02,643
- 真是太好了! - 这不是Danny的错
- Wonderful! - It wasn't Danny's fault.

465
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,883
壶已经空了,我们付不出这个钱
The pot is empty,we can't pay out.

466
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:08,124
所有的准备都是要把他引进来 在下次下一把大的
Everything was geared to take him in for the big one next time.

467
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,364
- 他已经很近了 - 近但还没有下决心,Danny
- He's this close. - Close does not cut it,Danny.

468
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:14,844
没有用的.我们必须不能让他得逞
It can't be helped.We'll have to shut him out.

469
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,405
你知道,有时候,一个要求完美的请求...
You know,sometimes a desire for perfection...

470
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,723
会被误解成是批评
can be misinterpreted as criticism.

471
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,929
- 是那样吗? - 是的
- Is that so? - Yeah.

472
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,372
你怎么那么暴躁?
Why so grumpy?

473
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,046
我不知道
I don't know.

474
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,326
是Rachel的原因?
Is it Rachel?

475
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,363
我收到了最后的裁决
I had the decree nisi.

476
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,766
都结束了
It's all over.

477
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,087
你为什么不说出来?
Why didn't you say?

478
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,289
那又能有什么帮助?
How would that have helped?

479
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:06,531
可以提醒你这里的每个人都爱你
Could have reminded you that everyone here loves you.

480
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:17,083
或许这次以后,我们应该好好休息一下
Maybe after this one,we should take a break for a while.

481
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:37,368
我认为我们应该下5万
I think we should do 50,000.

482
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,405
随便你了
Whatever you say.

483
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,242
你好
Hello.

484
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:48,524
压Mostarsil
Put it on Mostarsil.

485
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:54,011
好了,在他到窗口之前就开始播吧
Run it now,before he gets to the window.

486
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,968
5万压Mostarsil在下一场独赢
Mostarsil in the next.50,000 to win.

487
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,002
比赛已经开始了,先生
The race has started,sir.

488
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,043
- 不会的,我是在它们开始之前说的 - 对不起,先生
- No,I said it before they started. - I'm sorry,sir.

489
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:12,922
有问题吗?
Problem?

490
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,608
- 我想要下注 - 比赛已经开始了,先生
- I was trying to place a bet. - The race has started,sir.

491
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,248
不能再下注,下次再试试吧
No more bets.Try the next race.

492
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,925
来吧,Mostarsil!
Come on,Mostarsil!

493
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,042
Christ!
Christ!

494
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,567
- 1赔10,那可是50万啊! - 我没有下注
- 10-to-1,that's 500,000! - I didn't get the bet on.

495
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:44,292
- 什么? - 我没有来得及
- What? - I didn't have time.

496
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,809
那可是50万啊!
That's 500,000.

497
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,048
妈的!
Shit!

498
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,887
不,等等.我要看他们在做什么
No,wait.I want to see what they're doing.

499
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,928
好的,他准备要上钩了 我们已经为明天准备好了
Okay,so he's gone for the bait,and we're all set for tomorrow.

500
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:41,288
Stacie,Danny,把他卷进来吧
Stacie,Danny,go reel him in.

501
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,006
有什么意见吗?
Any thoughts?

502
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,764
你都已经全部掌握了
Think you've covered everything.

503
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,650
那就把他卷进来
Then go bring him in.

504
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,289
这次不能有错了
And no mistakes this time.

505
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:11,291
我知道,我知道,但我在教他
I know,but I'm teaching him.

506
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,444
你在窒息他
You're smothering him.

507
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,891
你要给他空间
Give him his head.

508
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,241
或许你会在他身上看见我所做的
Maybe you'll see in him what I did.

509
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,564
而我曾经在你身上见过一次
What I saw in you once.

510
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:29,886
我们有个问题,必须碰个面
We've got a problem,we're gonna have to meet up.

511
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,761
是的,好的.6点半怎么样?
Yeah,okay.What about 6:30?

512
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,688
好的,谢谢,Anthony
All right.Thanks,Anthony.

513
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,361
这个国家开始围捕法律了,你知道的
This country's got stalking laws,you know.

514
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:47,367
只是觉得我该让你知道我明天就要回去了
Just thought I'd let you know I'm heading back tomorrow.

515
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,489
3点会结账离开
I check out of the hotel at 3:00.

516
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:52,610
很好,但我还没有下决定
That's fine,but I haven't made a decision yet.

517
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,771
你会来的
You'll be there.

518
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:01,682
什么?
What?

519
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:03,929
有的财团开始被调查了
The syndicate's being investigated.

520
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,607
- 为什么? - 我不知道,好不好,但就是开始了
- Why? - I don't know,all right?It is.

521
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,604
有人听到了风声,都结束了
Someone got wind of it.It's all off.

522
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,332
- 不可能的 - 我告诉你了,就是
- It can't be. - I'm telling you,it is.

523
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,406
他们明天会做一笔,然后就开拔走人
They're gonna do one tomorrow,then pulling the plug.

524
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,324
等等,你是说他们会再做一次
Wait.You said they're doing one more.

525
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,085
已经布局好了
It's already set.

526
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:22,367
- 为什么我们不可以呢? - 你在说笑吗?
- Why can't we do it,too? - Are you having a laugh?

527
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,889
权威人士会像老鹰一样盯着整场比赛的
The authorities will be watching that race like hawks.

528
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:28,886
他们会盯着那些财团,而不是我们
They'll be watching the syndicate,not us.

529
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:32,283
我不知道.你在想什么?
I don't know.What do you think?

530
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:34,487
冒险
Risky.

531
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,887
他不敢,就这样
He who dares and all that.

532
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:44,563
确定这值得冒险吗?
Surely it's worth the risk?

533
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,049
如果我们要做这笔...
If we're gonna do this...

534
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,884
就应该是笔大的
it has got to be a big bet.

535
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,081
因为我告诉你了,这是最后的机会
Because I'm telling you,this is the last chance.

536
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,572
绝对
Absolutely.

537
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:02,810
我最多只能提升到3万
The most I can raise is probably going to be about 30,000.

538
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:07,052
开玩笑.我才不愿为这个而冒被抓住的危险呢
You've got to be joking.I'm not risking getting caught for that.

539
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,323
那要多少你才肯冒险?
So how much would it take?

540
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:15,566
50万
500,000.

541
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:19,684
- 什么? - 50万
- What? - 500,000.

542
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:23,402
即使只有1赔2的赔率,我们也能赚个100万
Even if we only get 2-to-1 again,we'd clear 1 million.

543
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,052
我怕这超出了我的范围
It's too rich for my blood I'm afraid.

544
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:34,852
如果有100万在银行的话,我们这个周末会非常美满的
We could have a wonderful week with 1 million in the bank.

545
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,565
对不起,不
I'm sorry,no.

546
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:42,647
好吧,如果你不能胜任...
Well,if you're not up to it...

547
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:46,003
这不是能不能胜任的问题...
It's not a question of not being up to it...

548
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,732
我只是不能一下子失去那么多钱
I just can't afford to lose that kind of money.

549
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,565
你怎么会失去呢?
How could you lose?

550
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,362
我是说,你都看见是如何运作的了
I mean,you've seen how it works.

551
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:56,047
即使这样
Even so.

552
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:58,926
50万
500,000.

553
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,131
<i>这可是一生才一次的机会</i>
<i>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</i>

554
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:10,563
<i>我是说,要不就是现在,要不就是永远也没有了</i>
<i>I mean,it's now or it's never.</i>

555
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:17,082
<i>记住:"懦夫难得美人心"</i>
<i>Remember:"A faint heart never won a fair maiden."</i>

556
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,848
好吧,我干了
Okay,I'm in.

557
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,642
银行经理觉得我有神经病 我只能威胁要关掉我的账户
Bank manager thought I was insane.I had to threaten to close my account.

558
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:40,645
你拿着双倍回来后他会冷静下来的
He'll calm down when you pay double back in.

559
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,644
你确信他们能接受这么大的赌注吗?
You're sure they'll take a bet this size?

560
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,564
你听到那个男人说的了,没有限制
You heard the man.No limit.

561
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:48,568
先生们.觉得运气不错吧?
Gentlemen.Feeling lucky again?

562
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,291
我认为没问题
I think we'll be okay.

563
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:52,647
是吗?
Think so?

564
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:56,088
我真是希望里面都是钱

我们很快就能把这笑容从他脸上擦掉
We'll soon wipe that smile off his face.

566
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,245
不要理他

567
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:09,526
Yvonne会通过电话告诉是哪匹马 然后和我们在这里碰面

- 有问题吗? - 稍等,先生
- Is there a problem? - One moment,sir.

584
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,287

585
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,409
这位先生要下一份大注,先生
This gentleman wants to place a large bet,sir.

586

00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,812
- 接受这位先生的赌注 - 但我没有时间来数
- Take the gentleman's bet. - I haven't got time to count it.

那么,你们都搞定了吗?

597
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:59,368
Roofer,50万押它独赢
Roofer,500,000 to win.

598
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:02,363
独赢?我告诉你"前两名"

599
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:06,853
- 什么? - 我是说"前两名"
- What? - I said "place."

600
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,131
财团主张前两名会让所有人都看不破伪装
The syndicate went for a place to throw everyone off the scent.

601
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:13,569
那才是我告诉你的 我说了,"Roffer在前两名"
That's what I told you.I said,"Place it on Roofer."

602
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,723

603
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,923
弄错了.我想要回我的钱
There's been a mistake.I want my money back.

604
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:24,811
- 先生? - 我是想说"前两名"不是"独赢
- Sir? - I meant to say "place," not "win."

605
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,121
比赛已经开始了,先生
The race has started,sir.

606
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:27,771
我不管,我要要回我的钱!
I don't care,I want my money back!

607
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,242
- 赌马规则规定... - 把我的钱给我
- House rules dictate that... - Give me my money.

608
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,607
拜托,放松
Come on,take it easy.

609
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:32,921
这里发生了什么事情?
What the hell is going on?

610
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,971
你不明白.搞错了
You don't understand.There's been a mistake.

611
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:40,809
没有弄错,先生,你的马刚输了
There was no mistake,sir.Your horse just lost.

612
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,451
放开我!
Get off me!

613
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:46,765
你不是Anthony Reeves先生吗 伙计们,来点镜头
Aren't you Sir Anthony Reeves?Boys,get some shots.

614
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,012
这就是你用辉煌的握手来做的事情吗,先生?
This is what you're doing with your golden handshake,sir?

615
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,606
用纳税人的钱来赌博?
Gambling with the taxpayers' money?

616
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,524
我没有赌博,我不赌博的
I'm not betting,I don't gamble.

617
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:56,446
- 这个男人在你这里下了赌注了吗,先生? - 这是机密
- Did this man place a bet with you,sir? - That's confidential.

618
00:40:56,533 --> 00:41:00,162
你能否向我们的读者解释一下 为什么你会出现在这个私人的赌博俱乐部的,先生?
Can you explain to our readers why you're in a private gambling club,sir?

619
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,403
我在拜访一个朋友
I'm visiting a friend.

620
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,008
你觉得纳税人应该资助你的赌博 喜好是否公平?
Do you think it's fair that the taxpayers should fund your gambling habit?

621
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:09,051
来吧,先生,你有什么要对我们的读者说的吗?
Come on,sir,what have you got to say to our readers?

622
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,807
比纳税人更重要吗,先生?
More important to the taxpayer,sir?

623
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:26,842
这是辆好车.你也是用你的所得来供车的吗,先生?
It's a nice car.Did you fund that out of your winnings,sir?

624
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,532
都在这里
There it is.

625
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,644
干得好,大家辛苦了 好了,让我们离开这里
Well done,everyone.All right,let's get out of here.

626
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,725
明天在Eddie的酒吧把工钱给你们.现在走吧
Wages in Eddie's Bar tomorrow night.Let's go.

627
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:55,927
- 做得好,伙计 - 好了,伙计们
- Well done,mate. - All right,mate.

628
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:09,203
现在一切都结束了 我有一些事情必须告诉你
Now this is all over,there's something I need to tell you.

629
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,487
事情是...
The thing is...

630
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:22,285
看看你们.就像下水道中的老鼠
Look at you.Rats in a sewer.

631
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:28,482
视力不错吧?这是什么?激光?我听说它们很不错
Eyesight better?What was it?Laser?I hear they're very good.

632
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,205
我们能为你做什么,Arthur?
What can we do for you,Arthur?

633
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:33,204
你能为我做什么?
What can you do for me?

634
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:35,932
你可以考虑跪下来亲我的脚...
You could try dropping to your knees,kissing my feet...

635
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,243
求我不要把这墙的痛苦加诸在你身上
and begging me not to paint the walls with you.

636
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,450
但我还是会满足你上次的嘴脸
But I'll settle for what you've just taken off the last mug.

637
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,331
对不起,我不知道你在说什么
I'm sorry,I don't know what you're talking about.

638
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:50,164
你们只有10秒时间
You've got 10 seconds.

639
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:04,889
把钱给他,Danny
Give him the money,Danny.

640
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:17,768
- 等等 - 闭嘴
- Hold on a minute. - Shut up.

641
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,168
不
No.

642
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,645
我恨透了他一直来告诉我 我什么时候可以说话,什么时候不可以
I'm sick of him telling me when I can speak and when I can't.

643
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:31,611
- 我来处理这个 - 就像你处理所有的事情一样?
- I'll handle this. - Like you do with everything?

644
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:34,964
对不起,Mickey,除非我错过了点什么...
I'm sorry,Mickey,but unless I've missed something here...

645
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:38,966
你带我们进入了洪流中,却忘记带划水的浆
you've just led us up shit creek and forgot to pack the paddles.

646
00:43:39,053 --> 00:43:41,567
哦,所以你才会那么做,是不是,Danny?
And that's what this is all about,isn't it,Danny?

647
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,564
因为你觉得你会做得更好
'Cause you think you could do better.

648
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:47,441
你为了避免出差错而做的所有事情就是低估我
Everything you've done since you got out of nick has been down to me.

649
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:48,522
低估你?
Down to you?

650
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:52,128
除了那句印象深刻的鹦鹉学舌:你自己来解决它们
Except for the parrot impressions:You do them yourself.

651
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,165
你是个弱智的骗子艺术家,Danny...
You were a short con artist,Danny...

652
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:56,972
在俱乐部酒吧骗骗那些喝醉的人 直到我把你带进来
working the clubs and bars for drinks till I took you in.

653
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:59,521
是啊,是你给我的机会,我很感激...
Yeah,you gave me a shot,and I'm grateful for that...

654
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:01,365
但那以后我一直在支持你
but I've been carrying you ever since.

655
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:05,048
不,你唯一支持的只是过于膨胀的自信心
No,the only thing you've been carrying is an over-inflated ego.

656
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:08,967
你不应该这么说自己,小子 你的确有一些含量
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself,son.You do have some qualities.

657
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:17,932
就这样了?
Is that it?

658
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,450
就这样,嗯,Mick?
That's it,huh,Mick?

659
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:28,928
你所有问题的答案
The answer to all your problems.

660
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:32,889
事情没有按你的方向来发展
Things ain't going quite your way,take a swing.

661
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:34,972
你就严厉斥责
Lash out.

662
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,091
你搞砸了
You screwed up.

663
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:42,446
现在把这个男人的钱还给他 然后走吧
Now give the man his money back and move on.

664
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,330
我本来就打算那么做的
I was gonna do it when you started this.

665
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:46,688
你是要把这箱可笑的钱给他
You were going to give him the case of funny money.

666
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:47,922
他就是这么要求的
It's what he asked for.

667
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:51,289
如果他发现这堆现金只是堆废纸要多久?
And how long would it take him to realize this cash is crap...

668
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,852
多久他就能回来杀了我们?
come back here and kill us?

669
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:56,812
做得好.你真是聪明.如果你不告诉他的话 他可并不知道这是箱假钞,你个天才
Well done.Brilliant.He didn't know it was fake until you just told him,genius.

670
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:59,009
你以为他不会发现吗?
You don't think he's gonna find out?

671
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:03,769
这东西,伙计,不能在任何街角的商店里面使用!
This stuff,mate,wouldn't pass in a corner shop!

672
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,605
那你要怎么做?把我们的钱给他?
So what would you do?Give him our money?

673
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:08,685
如果只有把钱给他和死亡两种选择呢?当然是把钱给他!
If it's a straight choice between that and death?Yes!

674
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:09,888
那会让我们一无所有
That would clean us out.

675
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,487
Mickey,他可拿着把猎枪!
Mickey,he's holding a shotgun!

676
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:14,291
我们会一无所有的!
We'd have nothing!

677
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,412
好吧,如果你要为了这个而G了性命...
Fine.If you wanna get killed,for what...

678
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:25,726
6万,还是7万?那就随便吧
60,000,70,000,go ahead.

679
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,646
给钱,Mick
Do it,Mick.

680
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,921
在你生命中,做一件正确的事情
For once in your life,do the right thing.

681
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,210
你到底怎么了?
What happened to you?

682
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,689
抽屉里有多少,Ash?
What's in the drawer,Ash?

683
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:05,486
就像你说的,6万,7万最多了
Like you said,60,000,70,000,tops.

684
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,612
付给那个人
Pay the man.

685
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:13,411
我想你最好按那个年轻人说的做
I suggest you do what the young man says.

686
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,722
确定那里面没有这些可笑的钱
And make sure there's none of that funny money in there.

687
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:33,165
对不起,Mick
I'm sorry,Mick.

688
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:42,051
4天内有5万镑的利息,不错啊
50,000 profit in four days,not bad.

689
00:46:42,693 --> 00:46:46,652
就像我告诉过你的,我总是能得到我要的
Like I told you boys,I usually get what I want.

690
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,525
你感觉到了吗?
Did you feel it?

691
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:14,092
太惊人了
Amazing.

692
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:17,209
- 我在滴... - 对不起
- I'm dripping... - I'm sorry.

693
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,045
接受你的复仇
Taking your revenge.

694
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:27,850
好了,来吧,大伙儿 我们现在马上离开!
All right,come on,everybody,let's get out of here now!

695
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:42,843
你今天过得如何,亲爱的?
Did you have a good day,dear?

696
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:53,044
Conmen,我的助手,他们以为在和一个该死的白痴打交道
Conmen,my ass.They thought they were dealing with a bloody idiot.

697
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:56,921
这些北部的乡村小子,还嫩着呢
Some country boy from up north,still wet behind the ears.

698
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:59,807
他们不会再犯那种错误了
They won't make that mistake again.

699
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:03,806
多带几捆苏格兰南部的小妞再来打败我吧
Take more than a bunch of Southern Jessies to get the better of me.

700
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:20,250
你还好吗,老板?
You all right,boss?

701
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,653
好了,就等一会儿
Right.Just wait a second.

702
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:58,448
等等
Wait.

703
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:01,093
我要走了,我以后不会再纠缠着你
I'm going now,so I won't be pestering you anymore.

Okay,that's it.So I guess what I really wanted to know is...

705
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:10,767
为什么你不愿意和我一起出去?

- Danny,你要跟我谈谈 - 什么时候?

- 肯定? - 当然

722
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:16,052
- 不会发生 - 不可能

或许我应该退休.从容地鞠躬谢幕

- 你是认真的? - 绝对
- You're serious? - Absolutely.

00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:53,963
- 这可要让人号啕大哭了,Albert - 你们会找到其他人的
- It'd be a crying shame,Albert. - You'll find someone else.

732

没人会像你一样,Albert

我告诉他了.我说"我并不是除了鞋子什么都不知道"
I told him.I said,"I don't know nothing about shoes."
