177
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
Otis!

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Otis!

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Uh...

180
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
[sighs]

181
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
- What?
- Shh.

182
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay, so...

183
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,320
you know how I said I was 99 percent sure
about the condom?

184
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,040
- Yes.
- It's more like 96.5.

185
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,200
The details are a bit hazy

186
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,520
and I think I remember
putting it in the bin,

187
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
but I can't be sure.

188
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Okay. What should we do?

189
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
[bell ringing]

190
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
[indistinct chatter]

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,320
- Shall we go play <i>Smash Bros?</i>
- Oh, I can't.

192
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,760
I've got to go to a service
at my church tonight.

193
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,520
- Is church boring?
- No.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,240
It's actually quite fun, you know.
There's singing, there's plantain,

195
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,600
and if you're lucky,
sometimes this auntie called Gloria

196
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,760
- starts speaking in tongues.
- Cool.

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
- Can I come with you?
- You don't want to come to my service.

198
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I think it will be interesting,
unless you don't want me to.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
No! Okay, sure.

200
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,800
But, um... [laughs]
...I have to be a bit different there.

201
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Like, a bit more serious,
if you get what I mean.

202
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah. That's okay.

203
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,520
- You sure?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
Let's go to church.

205
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,160
[laughs]

206
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
[Jackson] What are you doing here?

207
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,880
We've made an appointment
with your counselor.

208
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,200
- Can't we do this another time?
- No, we're doing it now. Get in.

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
Get in the car.

210
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
Well, well.

211
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,800
Here we are. I don't like keeping you
after school, girls, but this is serious.

212
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,840
I had nothing to do with this,
and it'll look really bad on my school CV,

213
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,720
- so may I go home, please?
- No, you may not.

214
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Somebody in this room
thought it would be funny

215
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
to write something very cruel about me
on that mirror.

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
We're going to sit here
until they admit it was them.

217
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,040
No one has anything to say?

218
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Fine. You will circle
every "A" in the paper

219
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,240
until one of you owns up.

220
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,256
- That's not very productive, miss.
- Neither is slut-shaming your teacher.

221
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Get circling, girls.
I'll be back to check on you.

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,040
Have you ever done this before?

223
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,960
No! What are you trying to say?
You slept with me too, you know.

224
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,000
I know, I'm not trying to say anything.

225
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,880
Look, I'm not having your pale,
unusually long children, okay?

226
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,600
- So just go in and get it already.
- Me?

227
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
I can't be seen buying
the morning after pill, Otis.

228
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,160
People will talk.

229
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,920
Go on. Go on.

230
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,680
[Roz] It's important
to tell Dr. Aiken everything.

231
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,920
You might need to up your meds.
You are taking them?

232
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
[Sofia] Your mum just asked you
a question.

233
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes. I'm taking them.

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Well, why didn't you answer her then?

235
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,120
[loud pop]

236
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
- [Roz] Shit. Oh, God. I think it's a flat.
- [Sofia] Brilliant, we're gonna be late.

237
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,336
- [Roz] I can't control it, can I?
- [Sofia] You drive too fast.

238
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,720
[Roz] I don't need this right now.

239
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
So, who's changed a tire before?

240
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
It wouldn't be good for my hand.

241
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Brilliant.

242
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,880
Very sensitive sinuses.

243
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,120
[register beeping]

244
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,640
[muffled] And can I get
the morning after pill, please?

245
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,840
- Excuse me?
- [slurred] The morning after pill?

246
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,656
- I can't hear you.
- [slurred] The morning after pill.

247
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,080
- I still can't hear you.
- [loudly] The morning after pill.

248
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
I can't sell it to you.

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,360
- Why not?
- You don't have a vagina, sir.

250
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
[door chimes]

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
It's not... It's nasal spray.

252
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,800
- You need to buy it in person.
- [door chimes]

253
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,840
What? Why? Ugh!

254
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,320
This is so humiliating.

255
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,440
It's not humiliating.

256
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay? I mean,
stuff like this happens all the time.

257
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
Condoms break,
or people forget to use them,

258
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,440
or they just go missing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

259
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,120
I also want you to know
if you are pregnant

260
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,400
and chose to keep the baby,
I'll quit school, get a job

261
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
and provide for you both.

262
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,480
[door chimes]

263
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,840
- When did you last have sex?
- Last night.

264
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
- Obviously.
- Did you use contraception?

265
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Yes.

266
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,880
- I think so.
- [Otis] The prophylactic's missing.

267
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Sorry, I'm not here.

268
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
- When was your last period?
- Two weeks ago.

269
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Have you taken
the emergency contraceptive pill before?

270
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,960
No. Why do people keep asking me that?
I'm not a slut.

271
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,840
Does anyone in your immediate family
have any health problems?

272
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,280
My dad has MS. He was diagnosed last year.
It's quite bad.

273
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
So, can I have the pill or not?

274
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,360
That'll be £25.

275
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,560
It's his penis, he's paying for it.

276
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
I am. I am?

277
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,640
- Please don't tell anyone I was here.
- I've no idea who you are.

278
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,720
That's impossible.
Everyone knows who I am.

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
[register beeping]

280
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Mm.

281
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,840
- Right, you've gotta be kidding me.
- Look, I'm just saying,

282
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,560
if you push it in first...

283
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,816
- [Sofia] Mind your hand out of the way.
- Oh, just push it in first, and then...

284
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,920
[Sofia] Oh, my God. This is stupid.
I'm calling them.

285
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,120
- I said we don't have to.
- This is so typical of you.

286
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Why can't you just admit you can't do it?

287
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,080
I can do it.

288
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Well, if you can do it
then why isn't it done?

289
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
[laughs]

290
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,840
And why are you laughing?

291
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Because you both just need
to get a divorce.

292
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,920
Why would you say that?

293
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,880
Because it's true.

294
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,560
You fight all the time.

295
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,160
You're so angry at mum,
but you pretend that you're not.

296
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
And you're so scared

297
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,520
I won't love you like a biological mum

298
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,856
that you just spend most of your time
pushing us both away.

299
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
I just think we'd all be a lot happier
if you just get a divorce.

300
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,760
Yeah, I'll go get her.

301
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Mum!

302
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
[Aimee] I'm finished too.

303
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,936
I think you're supposed to circle
all the "A" s,

304
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,520
- not just the singular ones.
- You're so dumb sometimes, Aimee.

305
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,760
- Olivia, do you want this pen in your eye?
- [Viv] You guys are such clichés.

306
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,440
Except for you, Lily.
You're genuinely weird.

307
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
- Thanks.
- What category are you in, Pythagoras,

308
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,720
- other than freak?
- The really, really intelligent one.

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Oh, really? [blows raspberry]

310
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,520
Olivia, Mr. Groff wants to see you.

311
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,480
- [Viv and Maeve] Ooh!
- Shut up.

312
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,600
Anyone have anything to admit?

313
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,200
- You can circle the "I" s next.
- Please, Miss Sands. This is pointless.

314
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,600
Okay, you want a challenge?

315
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,560
You can spend the rest of detention
preparing a presentation

316
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,560
on what binds you together as women.

317
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,560
One or all of you wanted to tear
a fellow female down,

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,400
now you can spend some time thinking about
what you have in common instead.

319
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
- You are joking, right?
- No, I'm not.

320
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
You have two hours to enlighten me.

321
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Unless you want a month
of detentions instead?

322
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
[Mr. Groff] I'd like you to know
we take these issues

323
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,040
very seriously indeed.

324
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,840
Olivia, come in.

325
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,160
Were you aware that Malek had received
sex advice from Miss Milburn?

326
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,040
Malek Amir talked about his girlfriend
wanting to incorporate...

327
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,216
- fetish...
- Those are my private notes,

328
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,440
and they're not meant to be read
by anybody else.

329
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,560
And I'm sorry,
but I don't know how they were misplaced.

330
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,120
Olivia, do you know
how old your boyfriend is?

331
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
He's... He's 16.

332
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Fifteen.

333
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,840
- Fifteen?
- Yeah, I skipped a year in primary school.

334
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
- What do you mean "fetish"?
- Amir is not an Indian surname.

335
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
We are Iranian.

336
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,320
- Iranian.
- You're 15?

337
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
You could go to prison for statutory rape!
This is very serious.

338
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
- [man] Iranian?
- Fifteen? What the fuck, Malek?

339
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Okay, Mum...

340
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,800
[muffled arguing]

341
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,800
- [man speaking indistinctly]
- We are not going to press charges.

342

515
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No.

516
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,720
Let's just tell Miss Sands that we resent
being grouped together

517
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
and forced to bond on the basis
of our gender.

518
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
Or I could pretend I like chocolate.

519
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,400
I know you are comfortable
with being dishonest, but I'm not.

520
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
What's that supposed to mean?

521
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,800
You pretend to be all radical
and feminist,

522
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,800
when you're just a girl who goes around
stabbing other girls in the back.

523
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,280
- It's not true.
- So, you didn't try

524
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,000
- and steal my boyfriend then?
- Can we not fight?

525
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,840
Shut up. It just got interesting.

526
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,640
I didn't try and steal your boyfriend,
Ola. I had to tell him how I felt.

527
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,640
You didn't have to, Maeve. You chose to.

528
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,280
Did you even like Otis?

529
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,440
Or did you just want to win?
You're a snake.

530
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,520
[Maeve] Yeah? At least I don't pretend
to be so sweet and nice all the time.

531
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,760
[Maeve and Ola]
You don't know anything about me!

532
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,600
Stop fighting over a stupid boy!

533
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
Aimes, why are you crying?

534
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,680
[breathing shakily]

535
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Because I can't get on the bus.

536
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,880
[Maeve] Oh, Aimes. It's okay.

537
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,760
It's okay.

538
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
[sighs]

539
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Um, can I come and see you?

540
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
I... I'm...

541
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,640
I didn't know who else to talk to.

542
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,320
You can all stop looking at me now.

543
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,640
[Viv] So you can't get on the bus

544
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,360
because you think
that man's gonna be on it again?

545
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,240
No. It's more that he had
this really kind face.

546
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
I remember because he smiled at me,

547
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,080
and he didn't look like
some wanking psycho killer.

548
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,680
So it's, like, if he could do something
like that, then anyone could.

549
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,640
I always felt safe before,
and now I don't.

550
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,040
- Probably sounds stupid.
- It doesn't sound stupid.

551
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,640
I was groped
at the train station last year.

552
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,000
<i>We were going to a gig in the city,
this group of guys walked past</i>

553
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,640
<i>and one of them grabbed my tit.</i>

554
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
[laughing]

555
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
<i>And it really, really hurt.</i>

556
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,920
So, I sometimes feel funny in crowds too.

557
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
It was like they thought
my body was theirs or something.

558
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah, like we're public property.

559
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,240
A few years ago,
some boys were catcalling me.

560
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,360
<i>This woman told me it was my fault
because my shorts were too revealing.</i>

561
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,200
<i>So I went home
and I cut them even shorter,</i>

562
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
because fuck them.

563
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,856
Good. Why should you have to change
your behavior because of what they did?

564
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
[Maeve] Exactly.

565
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,280
I used to go to the local swimming pool
all the time when I was a kid.

566
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,320
<i>One day this guy flashed me his penis
in the pool...</i>

567
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,040
<i>and it looked all dangly
and funny under the water.</i>

568
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,760
[laughing]

569
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,080
I told my mum about it,
and she wouldn't let me go back anymore.

570
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,680
It's sad because
the pool was my favorite place to go.

571
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
- That's so unfair.
- I guess,

572
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,760
but statistically, two thirds of girls
experience unwanted sexual tension

573
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,880
or contact in public spaces
before the age of 21.

574
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,360
So, it's not unusual.

575
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,680
Why are some men so obsessed
with getting their dicks out?

576
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,720
Sometimes I go on Chat Roulette,

577
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
and there are so many flaccid penises
on there.

578
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,600
<i>There are long ones, short ones, fat ones.</i>

579
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,080
<i>There was once even one that looked like
it had a tiny face.</i>

580
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,480
I think if I had an extra arm growing
in between my legs,

581
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,080
- I might want to show everyone too.
- [Maeve] Yeah.

582
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,480
- Maybe it's a power thing.
- Yeah.

583
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,200
I think the man on the bus
liked that I was afraid.

584
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
A man followed me home from work
about a year ago.

585
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,080
<i>Every time I sped up, he sped up.</i>

586
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
<i>It was so scary.</i>

587
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,640
He ran off when he saw my dad,
which made me angry

588
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,200
because I don't want to be dependent
on another man to protect me.

589
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,760
- I'm sorry that happened to you.
- You too.

590
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
Thank you.

591
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,200
At least we can go home now.

592
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Dicks.

593
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,560
[chuckles]

594
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,376
- I'll tell you who loves ginger nuts.
- Yeah?

595
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
- Eric Clapton.
- Really?

596
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,400
- Absolutely loves them.
- Are you joking?

597
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
Stop!

598
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,160
[stammers] I only did it 'cause
I love you, and I found out you love him.

599
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
He can't offer you what I can, miss.

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,880
I have an innate appreciation
for older women,

601
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
and I can roll a joint
into the shape of a swan.

602
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,680
That is problematic on so many levels,

603
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,520
but I must say the lipstick
was an ingenious touch.

604
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,800
- You really think so?
- It's not happening, Kyle. Okay?

605
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Follow me.

606
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,240
- I love you.
- [Mr. Hendricks] Now!

607
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
[Adam] Sit.

608
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,240
- Stand.
- I don't believe it.

609
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Sit.

610
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
[whimpers]

611
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,640
It's a miracle. Ha!

612
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,160
You're a smart boy.
Why aren't you in school?

613
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm no good at school.

614
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,640
Yes, well, you carry on like this,
you're looking at employee of the month.

615
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,760
Huh?

616
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm going to go to the movies tonight,
so you can lock up for me.

617
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,280
I'm going to go and get ready.

618
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,600
[door opens, closes]

619
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Girls...

620
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

621
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,120
We've found the culprit.
You may go home now.

622
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm very sorry for wasting your time.

623
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,400
[Viv] Well, great. I knew it.

624
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh, out of curiosity,
what did you come up with?

625
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
What binds you together?

626
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,600
Other than non-consensual penises, miss,
not much.

627
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,360
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I think so.

628
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
I don't feel sad, I just feel angry.

629
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
I know something that might help.

630
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
[Rahim] I like your family. They're sweet.

631
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
What do you mean "sweet"?

632
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,480
The way they believe
in all that God stuff.

633
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
They think it's real.

634
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,080
I believe in it too.

635
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah, but not properly.

636
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,080
- You pretend to keep the peace, right?
- No.

637
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,000
No, I believe in God, Rahim.

638
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,320
How can you believe in a god
that doesn't think you should exist?

639
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,480
Okay, this is awkward.

640
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,520
No, my family had to leave their country
because of religion.

641
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

642
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
- I didn't know that.
- It's okay.

643
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,280
It's our differences
that make me love you.

644
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
We'll agree to disagree.

645
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Love?

646
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,440
Does that freak you out?

647
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,600
No, no, no. Uh...

648
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,080
I... I love you too.

649
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
<i>Ah, putain!</i>

650
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,960
- I think my heart stopped for a moment.
- [laughs]

651
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Let's go.

652
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,760
I just cannot believe
he's been taking all that money

653
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,520
from all those other students.

654
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,280
I feel like
I don't know him at all, like...

655
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,240
like I've got a stranger
living in my house.

656
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,560
I think we can't ever truly know
these creatures that we created.

657
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,520
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Talk to him.

658
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
That's all you can do.

659
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Hey.

660
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,800
Want to get something to eat after this...

661
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
with me?

662
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm afraid I can't do that, Jean.

663
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,680
It was one stupid kiss.

664
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,560
You really can't forgive me?

665
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You know...

666
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,320
I may not be as intellectual
as your ex-husband,

667
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
but I do know my boundaries.

668
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,520
I can't go through
that kind of pain again.

669
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm not sure if I could get up.

670
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,800
- My girls need me.
- Mm.

671
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Mm.

672
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
You're not ready
for the kind of intimacy I'm looking for.

673
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Understood.

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Goodbye, Jakob.

675
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah.
