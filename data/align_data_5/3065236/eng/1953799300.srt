1
00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:02,221
My brothers and I

2
00:00:02,222 --> 00:00:04,143
are the first vampires
in history...

3
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:06,082
The originals.

4
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,818
300 years ago,
we called New Orleans home.

5
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:12,020
Now we've returned,
drawn by a witch

6
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:15,074
who seeks to use my brother
Klaus' unborn child

7
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,959
as leverage in a brewing war...

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,663
Sabine, tell them
what you saw.

9
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:22,881
How was this
vision interpreted?

10
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:25,216
Your baby would bring
death to all witches.

11
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:26,552
But the quest for power

12
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,137
has turned brother
against brother,

13
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,538
leaving our family
more divided than ever.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,808
Now that Elijah has returned,

15
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,011
can our family unite
to face this new threat?

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,702
So this
is what you do

17
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:00,753
the first time we're
back together

18
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,538
as a family...
Vampire book club.

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,675
Reading edifies
the mind, sister.

20
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,393
Isn't that right,
Elijah?

21
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,679
Yes. That's quite
right, Niklaus.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,846
And what's
this business?

23
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:13,516
This is
a peace offering.

24
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:15,184
I presumed,
after so much time

25
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:17,470
desiccating in a coffin,
that my big brother

26
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:19,271
might be
a bit peckish.

27
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,856
So I explained
to my little brother

28
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:22,858
that forgiveness
cannot be bought.

29
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,276
I'd simply prefer to see
a change in behavior

30
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:28,481
that indicates contrition
and personal growth,

31
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:30,900
not this nonsense.

32
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,668
I couldn't very well
let her go to waste, could I?

33
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,239
Well, I suppose I'll
fetch the rubbish bin

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,342
because you're staining
a 200-year-old carpet.

35
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,213
Oh, yes.

36
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,871
"I was angry with my friend"

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,006
"I told my wrath,

38
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,959
"my wrath did end.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,014
"I was angry with my foe:

40
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,433
"I told it not,

41
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:09,071
"my wrath did grow.

42
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:13,325
"And I water'd it in fears,

43
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:17,613
"night and morning
with my tears;

44
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:23,085
"and I sunned it with smiles,

45
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:28,290
"and with soft deceitful wiles.

46
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,994
"And it grew both
day and night,

47
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,964
"till it bore
an apple bright;

48
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,883
"and my foe beheld it shine,

49
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:42,338
"and he knew that it was mine,

50
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,524
"and into my garden stole

51
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:48,811
"when the night
had veil'd the pole:

52
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:52,098
"In the morning glad I see

53
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,584
my foe outstretch'd
beneath the tree."

54
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,519
Good morning.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,621
Hey.

56
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:05,077
Listen. I know I'm
the only one

57
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,495
in this house that
actually drinks milk,

58
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,830
but would it kill
any of you

59
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,298
to make sure it's
on the grocery list?

60
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,467
Speaking of,
add bleach.

61
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,002
You know, I do hope
my siblings were

62
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,421
hospitable toward you
in my absence.

63
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,473
In your absence... as
you like to call it,

64
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:18,841
which is a
way-too-polite way

65
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:19,925
of saying that
your brother

66
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:22,144
put a dagger
in your heart...

67
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:26,215
I have been attacked by
French quarter vampires.

68
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:28,734
I've had to live in a house
with a secret dungeon

69
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,904
full of coffins, and I
was nearly murdered

70
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,656
by witches who are
convinced that my baby

71
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,191
is Lucifer.

72
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,449
Oh...

73
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,283
Milk.

74
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,003
They've been...
Fine...

75
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,708
Weirdly protective.

76
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,044
I know I have you
to thank for that.

77
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,145
I'm just happy
to see that you're

78
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:59,431
in one piece.

79
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:01,600
So back to the
murderous witches,

80
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,919
I have
some concerns.

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,388
They're evil,
and my life

82
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,391
is still magically
linked to Sophie Deveraux,

83
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:11,426
which is not comforting.

84
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:12,945
Yes. I think it's
time we took care

85
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:14,780
of that little
problem.

86
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,482
I'm all for it.

87
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:20,069
As soon as they're unlinked,
we get to leave this crap town.

88
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,603
Who do we have to kill?

89
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,105
Probably no one.

90
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,609
All right.
Potentially everyone.

91
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:36,276

92
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,760
I cook on that,
you know?

93
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,096
Don't get
cranky with me.

94
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:50,099
I'm the only witch
who still likes you.

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,233
Yeah. It's not like
I'm trying to save

96
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:53,135
the witch heritage
or anything.

97
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,971
They'll come around.

98
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:58,440
They're just
old-school and scared.

99
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,692
Scared of what,

100
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:01,944
your prophecy
about the hybrid baby?

101
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:03,779
Agnes and her
freak show minions

102
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,581
had a real field day
with that one.

103
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,866
Can't help
what I see, so...

104
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:11,753
Well, if you're psychic,
I'm Martha Stewart. Scooch.

105
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,544
What the...

106
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,692
Poetry about poisoned
apples from dead trees.

107
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:37,780
Looks like someone is worried
about impending daddyhood.

108
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,284
Nonsense.
Elijah is back.

109
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,786
In his presence,
all problems

110
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:47,790
turn to pixie dust
and float away.

111
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,292
Strange,
I don't recall any pixie dust

112
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,828
from the darkness of the coffin
I was recently forced to endure.

113
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,217
What are you doing with
mother's spell book?

114
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,668
Well, in exchange
for my freedom,

115
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,420
I promised the witch Davina

116
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:04,873
that I would share a few pages
from mother's grimoire.

117
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:08,043
It'll help her learn
to control her magic.

118
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:12,046
Thought we'd begin with
a little unlinking spell.

119
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,067
Wait. You want to
use her to unlink

120
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,685
Hayley from
Sophie Deveraux?

121
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:19,488
Sophie brought us to this town
under false pretenses.

122
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:22,107
She doesn't just want us to take
down Marcel and his minions.

123
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,693
She wants to take
Davina back.

124
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,829
So she yoked
her own cause to ours

125
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,563
with magic, threats,
and half-truths.

126
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,783
Well, no more.

127
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,335
As of now, our deal
with Sophie Deveraux

128
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,587
is null and void.

129
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,006
Niklaus, I need you
to come with me.

130
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,457
I need 5 minutes
alone with Davina.

131
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,626
You need to make certain
that I am not interrupted.

132
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,045
You stay here
and watch Hayley.

133
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,299
How did I get
elected supernanny?

134
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,352
More importantly,
who put him in charge?

135
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:03,531
Hey, is everything ok?

136
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,569
Can I get you
something?

137
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,538
Look. I know you want
a daylight ring, kid.

138
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,622
Little heads-up,

139
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:13,608
I got guys 80 years
ahead of you.

140
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,445
Noted. Sorry.

141
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:22,884
Wait.

142
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,223
You know
Klaus Mikaelson.

143
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,642
I asked you to give him
a lift home a couple times

144
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:34,730
to the palace
royale hotel, right?

145
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,349
Um, yeah,
the palace royale.

146
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,352
You see, I stopped by
his hotel to say sorry

147
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,171
about an argument
we had.

148
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,873
Turns out, he lied
about living there.

149
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,059
Lied.

150
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,527
Did you ever
hear the phrase

151
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,363
"uneasy is the head
and wears the crown"?

152
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:54,316
Uh, "lord of the rings"?

153
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:56,668
No. Shakespeare.

154
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,337
When I was a kid, Klaus
taught me how to read

155
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,889
with those plays,
always about some King

156
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,926
who gained the world
but lost his soul,

157
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:06,345
but now I get it.

158
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,596
See, when it's all
said and done,

159
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:09,047
you look around at
the empire you built.

160
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,717
The only thing that matters
is who you can trust.

161
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:12,885
There's got to be
somebody somewhere

162
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:15,921
that you can trust,
someone "to stick

163
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:17,839
"to you through
thick and thin...

164
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,508
To the bitter end."

165
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:20,776
Sam to Frodo,

166
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:23,644
"fellowship
of the ring."

167
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,399
There is someone.

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,184
We used to be
best friends.

169
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,804
I made you a promise.

170
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:51,806
Come in.

171
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:56,344
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,616
It's been, oh, a year

173
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,551
since I've had a good
conversation with you.

174
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:03,936
Camille.

175
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,271
You've been
avoiding me, Uncle K.

176
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:09,825
My favorite niece?
Never.

177
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:12,443
Don't lie.
This is a church.

178
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,965
Besides, I came about
professional advice...

179
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,643
About Sean.

180
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,376
The spell
of unknotting?

181
00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:29,595
This is
a sanguinem knot.

182
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,014
The witches use it as
representational magic.

183
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,216
If you can unknot this
rope using that spell,

184
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:35,467
you'll have taken
an important step

185
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,603
towards control.

186
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,105
This is one of my
mother's later spells,

187
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,725
requires much more power
than you realize.

188
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,028
If you can
perform this,

189
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,030
I shall return
with another page...

190
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,537
Spell of your
choosing next time.

191
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,075
Only because
I'm a masochist,

192
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:01,793
I went by Sean's
grave today, and...

193
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:03,295
Damn it.

194
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,947
I was hoping to get that
cleaned up before you saw it.

195
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,598
I hope it didn't
upset you too much.

196
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,468
It didn't
bother me at all.

197
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,587
That's the problem.
That's why I'm here.

198
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,655
I've slept like a baby
every night this week,

199
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,557
even though
my twin brother hacked

200
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,759
9 priests to death
not two feet

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,795
from this confessional.

202
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:23,732
A guy I've been
seeing, Marcel,

203
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,400
has been blowing me off.

204
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,236
Whatever. I've gone on
two dates with the guy,

205
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,354
and I'm more upset
about that

206
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,307
than seeing
"murderer" scrawled

207
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:35,043
across my
brother's grave.

208
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:38,213
It's called
healing, Cami.

209
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,816
For month's
after the massacre,

210
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,235
I couldn't think
of anything else,

211
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:48,090
and then suddenly,
nothing.

212
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:52,678
I need to feel
that pain.

213
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,683
Without it, I feel
broken, empty,

214
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,969
like there's
someone to blame

215
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,473
and I'm letting them
get away with it.

216
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,275
Listen. If you
have found a way

217
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,110
to turn it off,
don't question it.

218
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,731
The only person
that is responsible

219
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,817
for Sean's behavior
is Sean.

220
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:21,323
Do you really
believe that?

221
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:23,792
Yes.

222
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,793
I do.

223
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,515
Let go of me.

224
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:49,100
Leave her be.

225
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:52,854
Killing me to get
to Klaus or his baby

226
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,606
is not the answer.

227
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,108
I'm not gonna
kill you, Sophie.

228
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,860
I was there
the day you were born.

229
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:01,580
I'm the last remaining
elder of our coven.

230
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,664
It is my duty
to protect our power,

231
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:08,003
and our power means nothing
if that baby grows another day.

232
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:11,039
Sabine's omen
was clear.

233
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,209
That baby will bring
death to us all.

234
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,128
What are you
gonna do?

235
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:22,384
Oh, God, no. No.
Agnes, no. No.

236
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,485
No! Don't you... aah!

237
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:31,607
Ah!

238
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,409
What
the hell was that?

239
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,862
Hell if I know.

240
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,863
It felt like
I was being stabbed.

241
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,984
What happened?

242
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,957
It was Agnes.

243
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,293
Her men
took Sophie.

244
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:51,712
Day one with you
in charge, brother,

245
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,514
and already the witch link
to Hayley

246
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:55,999
has been abducted
by zealots.

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,384
Where is she?

248
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,502
If I tell you
where Agnes is,

249
00:12:58,503 --> 00:12:59,636
you'll just kill her.

250
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,004
Is it that
obvious?

251
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,173
Look. I know she's
a little cuckoo,

252
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,726
but she's our last
living elder.

253
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,010
That might not mean
a lot to you,

254
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,177
but it means
plenty to us.

255
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,196
The elders are
the only ones

256
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:11,098
who can do
important spells.

257
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,534
Like completing
the harvest ritual.

258
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,401
You know
about that?

259
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:18,372
Oh, you'd be astounded
by the things I know.

260
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,407
Allow me to
entertain you

261
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:22,459
with today's list
of priorities.

262
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,694
One, unlink
your friend Sophie

263
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,413
so she no longer
controls the fate

264
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:28,082
of the woman
carrying my child.

265
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,033
Two, convince
my brother to accept

266
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,418
my heartfelt
apologies

267
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,637
for some recently
dodgy behavior.

268
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,473
3, there is no 3.

269
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:38,725
I believe what my brother is
attempting to communicate here

270
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:40,761
is that neither the life
of this elder

271
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,479
nor the harvest ritual
nor your coven's

272
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,897
connection to magic
are of any relevance

273
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:47,016
to him whatsoever.

274
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,488
Now talk.

275
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,784
Thierry.

276
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:06,503
Marcel.

277
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,006
Come to punish
me again?

278
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,440
Someone asked
if there's anyone

279
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,792
I ever trusted.

280
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:13,876
I only came up
with one name...

281
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:19,600
You.

282
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,851
So, Thierry,
you and I

283
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,686
are gonna have
a little talk...

284
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,724
About Klaus Mikaelson.

285
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,312
It's time for
the demon spawn to snack.

286
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:35,364
I really wish you
wouldn't call her that.

287
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,451
I'm sorry. Have you
picked another name yet?

288
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:41,103
Take one. The plantation
is lousy with them.

289
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:42,789
How's your neck?

290
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,160
I feel fine,
which is weird.

291
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,495
I'm sure this
is Sophie-related.

292
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,464
Well, do me a favor and
don't die on my watch.

293
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:51,781
I'll never hear
the end of it.

294
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,050
You know, when I
first met you,

295
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,284
I thought you
were a real bitch.

296
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:56,587
What changed
your mind?

297
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:58,388
Oh, I still think
you're a bitch.

298
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,473
I've just grown
to like that about you.

299
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,125
Ha ha!

300
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,178
Well, that's sweet
of you to say.

301
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,679
Remember it
when I'm gone.

302
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,815
Gone? Where
are you going?

303
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,067
I only came to town
to make sure

304
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,468
everything was ok
with Elijah.

305
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,638
He's fine, and he
hasn't punished Klaus

306
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,074
for daggering him,
so, as usual,

307
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,375
they'll be thick
as thieves,

308
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,810
and I'll be left to
clean up the mess.

309
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,615
It's time for me
to fly the coop.

310
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:27,617
Oh.

311
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:34,124
What's wrong?

312
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,925
I don't know.

313
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,212
Probably
morning sickness.

314
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,929
Oh, you're burning
up, actually.

315
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:45,168
Ah! Agnes stuck me
with a needle.

316
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:49,723
Ugh! Cursed objects were
created a long time ago.

317
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,341
We use them so we
don't get busted

318
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,176
by Marcel
for doing magic.

319
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,662
The one she used is called
the needle of sorrows.

320
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,264
It was cursed
in 1860, when...

321
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:58,498
Jump ahead
a few decades

322
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,983
and tell us
what it does, luv.

323
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,617
It has one purpose...

324
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:05,488
To kill a child in utero by
raising her blood temperature.

325
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,910
It's for
a miscarriage.

326
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,462
So how much time do
we have to fix this?

327
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:15,332
It'll do what it's meant to
by tonight's high tide,

328
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,417
and... believe me...
It will work.

329
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,869
I saw her use a similar object
on a kid who went mad

330
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,921
and killed a bunch
of priests.

331
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,875
I'd like to have a little
chat with this Agnes.

332
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,877
Where can I
find her?

333
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,546
You won't.

334
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,881
There are a thousand places she
could hole up to wait it out.

335
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:32,983
That's precisely why
we need to unlink you

336
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,385
from Hayley,
no more danger

337
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:37,354
towards her
or the child.

338
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,573
No. What?

339
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,391
If I am not linked
to Hayley,

340
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,360
I lose my
leverage on you.

341
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:44,962
We got a deal.

342
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,148
We are not on the same side,
Sophie Deveraux.

343
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,283
Our deal
no longer stands.

344
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,873
Does this mean
you're pardoning me?

345
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,825
Aw, you know
I can't do that.

346
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,744
You broke my
number-one rule.

347
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,129
You killed
a vampire, T.

348
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,964
I let that go, it'll
make me look weak.

349
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,052
I warned you
about Klaus.

350
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,188
Yeah. I should've
listened.

351
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,273
This guy has been
in my town for months

352
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:16,026
but hiding where
he lays his head at night.

353
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:18,361
What else is he hiding
is what I want to know.

354
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,764
I didn't listen
to you before,

355
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,231
but I sure as hell
am now.

356
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,990
Tell me about the night
that got you put in here,

357
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,326
and you might find yourself
out by Mardi Gras.

358
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:38,665
The night of the
masquerade party,

359
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,250
you sent us rousting
in the cauldron

360
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,552
to mess with
the witches.

361
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,137
So when Max
came in rousting,

362
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:45,639
he went right
for Katie's throat.

363
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,109
Now, you said to roust.
You didn't say to kill.

364
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,812
Now, he's a nightwalker.
I'm a daywalker.

365
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,765
I told him to stop,
and he wouldn't.

366
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:57,433
So I stopped him.

367
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:02,855
That night is on an
endless loop in my head.

368
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,741
I think Max
was compelled.

369
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,277
No. All my guys
are on vervain.

370
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,030
Not if Klaus
drained them.

371
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,665
Max went missing
for a couple of days

372
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,500
before the
rousting, right?

373
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,984
T., they found stuff
you and your girl

374
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:16,319
stole from me
in her shop.

375
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,705
Have you ever been
to the Jardin Gris?

376
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,040
You can't find
your own hand

377
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,542
in front of
your face in there,

378
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,661
and yet somehow
someone went in there,

379
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:25,995
and after a couple
of minutes,

380
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:29,382
they found
some stolen goods?

381
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:36,223
Go there,
see for yourself,

382
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:39,893
but I'm telling you,
besides Max,

383
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:41,728
somebody else
in the crew

384
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:45,298
had to be compelled.

385
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,901
Watch your back.

386
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,740
So a few tourists
go missing, ok.

387
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,742
We can spin it,
no problem,

388
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,711
but do you know
how rd it is to sell

389
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:59,713
a gas-leak story to
the city council

390
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,431
when a bunch
of church windows

391
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,048
magically explode?

392
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,367
Come on, Mr. mayor.

393
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,636
What is this,
an electoral debate?

394
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:09,306
Marcel overstepped.
I will handle it.

395
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,975
Easier
said than done.

396
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,643
Marcel is quite
the little warrior.

397
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,928
Uh-uh.

398
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,045
Aah!

399
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,431
Who
the hell are you?

400
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,599
My name is Klaus,

401
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,553
and you lot
are the faction...

402
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,489
Pillars of the community
who maintain

403
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,858
the city's
supernatural balance.

404
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,726
I should know.

405
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,395
I created this group,
only in my day,

406
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:36,166
it was a bunch of pirates
and corrupt politicians.

407
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,168
Looks like
nothing has changed.

408
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,620
One thing has.

409
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:41,921
It's exclusively
human now...

410
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:45,124
No vampires allowed,
especially no originals.

411
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,795
I haven't come
to join.

412
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,630
I've come to ask
this group to utilize

413
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,515
its considerable
resources

414
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:55,936
to find a witch elder
named Agnes.

415
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,321
All I need
is an address.

416
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,689
And why would we
want to help you?

417
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,275
What if I told you
that Agnes

418
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,810
was the answer
to a question

419
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,896
you've been asking since
you ran screaming

420
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:08,365
from this town,

421
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,785
that she is
the witch who hexed

422
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:16,705
your nephew Sean?

423
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,329
We'd need some time
to discuss...

424
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,914
I don't have time...

425
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:29,251
Nor do I like being
asked to wait.

426
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:34,140
You may have
all the vampires

427
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:37,143
in this town
cowering in fear,

428
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,063
but right now, you are
dealing with the humans,

429
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:43,132
and unless you plan
on killing all of us,

430
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:46,736
I politely suggest
you do as I say

431
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,990
and give us time
to discuss it.

432
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,912
You know, what I like
about you, father,

433
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,032
is, you're aware
of my reputation

434
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,867
and yet still
you stand tall

435
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:03,653
against me.

436
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:06,206
It's admirable.

437
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,374
You have one hour.

438
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,347
Track down that witch...

439
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:17,350
Cell phone records,
our guys in the 9th.

440
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,769
For the vampire?

441
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,888
No, for me.

442
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:34,826
Phesmatos, omnio ligor
coldate sangorium.

443
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,495
Stop fussing, will you?

444
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,746
Elijah will be here
any minute.

445
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,831
I feel like I've
been microwaved.

446
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:52,334
Hey, just because
you're carrying a baby

447
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:54,219
doesn't mean you get
to act like one.

448
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,754
I'm sure my little niece
is healing you up as we speak.

449
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:03,145
What the hell
is she doing here?

450
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,130
I'm trying to help.
Help?

451
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,732
You're the reason we're
in this bloody mess.

452
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:07,933
Why aren't we unlinked
with this witch

453
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,334
already, Elijah?

454
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:12,237
Rebekah, let her
do what she can.

455
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,856
I may know a way
to slow the fever down,

456
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,658
but I'm gonna need
some special herbs.

457
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,993
I'll text you
a list.

458
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,416
Fine. Happy to play
the fetch girl.

459
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:44,552
Isn't this
Katie's shop?

460
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,473
She leave you the
keys in her will,

461
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:51,009
or maybe it's just
help yourself Tuesday?

462
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,110
What are you
doing here?

463
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,230
You know, I read that
if you mix mugwort with sage,

464
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:57,065
you've got quite
the vampire repellant,

465
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,951
wards off even
the most resilient pest.

466
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:01,370
Why are you here?

467
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:02,571
Just keeping
my city safe

468
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:03,905
from thieves
and vandals,

469
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:05,240
but every time
I turn around,

470
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:06,625
I catch an original

471
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,077
with their hand
in the cookie jar.

472
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:12,197
Well, luckily for you,
your cookies

473
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:14,216
are the last thing
on my mind.

474
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:17,302
Oh, I can see that,
though I remember

475
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:20,972
a time when things
were different.

476
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:25,727
Maybe once.
Not anymore.

477
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:28,763
Camphor. Find it.

478
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:49,700
Going somewhere?

479
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:52,337
You're early.

480
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,406
Well, it's
a good thing I am.

481
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,158
You seem hell-bent
on enacting vengeance

482
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,211
all on your
lonesome.

483
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:01,830
The trouble is,
I need something

484
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,682
from Agnes before
you send her off

485
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:06,084
to meet her maker.

486
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:11,472
So I propose
we strike a deal.

487
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:14,976
Bring her here.

488
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,362
In exchange,
I'll even ensure

489
00:24:17,363 --> 00:24:22,366
your niece Cami
remains safe.

490
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:27,205
Mm. I would
so hate for her

491
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:30,741
to get caught up
in all this.

492
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:40,811
This is outrageous.
What's the charge?

493
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,863
Please, Agnes.

494
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:45,782
You know that Marcel runs
the vampires in this town.

495
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:50,202
Who do you think
runs everything else?

496
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:56,827
I believe this is what
you're looking for.

497
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,894
Hello, Agnes.

498
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,965
You made a deal
with him?

499
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,217
After what you
did to Sean,

500
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:05,886
I'd deal with
the devil himself

501
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,504
just to see you
suffer.

502
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,621
You can't hurt me.

503
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:09,622
The entire witch
community

504
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:10,724
will turn
against you.

505
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,424
Enough!

506
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:16,178
Please. Enough.

507
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,899
I don't care
about witch politics.

508
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,851
I don't care about
your ridiculous,

509
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,802
little harvest ritual.

510
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:26,907
What I care about
is this trinket.

511
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:32,907
Undo its curse, or I'll show you
things worst than death.

512
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:37,484
Dark objects don't come
with an off switch.

513
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,719
The curse took root
in Sophie.

514
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,340
She's linked
to your devil child.

515
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,210
It's just
a matter of time.

516
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:50,664
She's burning up.
We need to do this now.

517
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:53,699
Get her
in the water.

518
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,385
I don't see how
a midnight swim

519
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,653
is supposed
to help.

520
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,021
Her temperature
is sky high,

521
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:00,023
and the water, with
the help of the herbs,

522
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:02,275
should cool us down.

523
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:03,693
Drink this.

524
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:05,111
You're gonna have to get
her heart rate down.

525
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:06,812
And how do you
suggest I do that?

526
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,365
Hold her.

527
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,515
It's a natural human remedy to slow the heart beating

528
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:10,850
and reduce
blood pressure.

529
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,202
This is never gonna work.

530
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,287
Davina will
break that link.

531
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,322
We just need time.

532
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:44,517
Phesmatos,
omnio ligata soluto.

533
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,436
Oh, I can't breathe.
Ok.

534
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,071
Take long,
deep breaths.

535
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:50,824
Hayley, look at me.
Long, deep breaths.

536
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,775
Just focus on the
sound of my voice.

537
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,915
You'll be ok.
You'll be ok.

538
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:04,996
Phesmatos, omnio ligata soluto.

539
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:09,875
Vingulia cordit...

540
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:14,430
Aah! Aah aah!

541
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:23,022
Agh!

542
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,669
I just felt it lift.

543
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,737
Oh...

544
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:49,799
Elijah.

545
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,834
Oh...

546
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,767
Let's go.

547
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:10,470
Elijah...

548
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,082
As soon as your
brother finds out

549
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,867
that the link
is broken,

550
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,735
he'll kill Agnes.

551
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,705
I know you don't
owe me anything,

552
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:24,042
but please don't
let him kill her.

553
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:28,264
Elijah,
she's our only access

554
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:30,683
to the power
we need to survive.

555
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:32,968
Promise me that
you'll stop him.

556
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:41,594
It's me.
Where are you?

557
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,981
Don't hurt her.
I'll be there shortly.

558
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:48,984
I'll make you
one last promise.

559
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,654
I won't let my brother
kill Agnes.

560
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:05,917
I know you were just
using me to save your people,

561
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,504
but try it again,
I'll kill you.

562
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,475
The unlinking worked.

563
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,610
Maybe now we
can make plans...

564
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:29,694
Not now, Rebekah.

565
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:30,912
Can we discuss this
when I return?

566
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:32,079
I won't be here
when you return.

567
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,918
That sounds like
a good-bye.

568
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,041
I guess it is.

569
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,175
I only came
to New Orleans

570
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:47,061
to make sure you
were safe.

571
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:49,764
You are.

572
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:51,266
I thought that
I might be able

573
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,767
to convince you
to come with me,

574
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,903
but here you are,
rushing off

575
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,071
into whatever
Klaus and Marcel

576
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,908
and the witches
have cooked up,

577
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,861
and I finally
get it.

578
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:05,229
You'll never
leave this city.

579
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,533
You'll never
leave Klaus.

580
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:16,691
Then you should stay.

581
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,244
This thing that you and
Klaus and Marcel have,

582
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,794
I want no part of it.

583
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:27,335
I just want to be free.

584
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:30,587
Well, then go.

585
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,594
You are free.

586
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:57,499
Rebekah...

587
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,284
Twice in one night.

588
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:02,787
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

589
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,839
Call me old-fashioned,
but I believe

590
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,760
farewells are best
in-person.

591
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:10,144
Got Elijah back,
and now you're both

592
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:12,380
gonna tuck tail
and run.

593
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:15,884
Smart girl.

594
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,852
Have a nice life.

595
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:19,804
He's staying,
and I'm not running.

596
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:21,439
I'm disembarking
a sinking ship.

597
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
People been saying
the city has been

598
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,542
sinking since
I was a boy.

599
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,278
It ain't
going anywhere,

600
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,767
but, hey, how about
one for the road?

601
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,036
Why, so you can
liquor me up

602
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:37,070
and convince me
to stay?

603
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,380
Why else did you
come here?

604
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:48,081
I came to say
good-bye.

605
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,639
Then say it.

606
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,565
Good riddance.

607
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:36,514
You're a piece
of work, Agnes,

608
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,549
but guess what.

609
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,503
I'm quite a piece
of work myself.

610
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,690
You know, I contemplated
leaving bits of you

611
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:50,028
artfully arranged
outside your family's tomb.

612
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:53,898
I thought it would leave
a fitting message.

613
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,818
Don't touch
my family.

614
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,619
Leave her.

615
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:04,625
I gave my word.

616
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,495
You tend to give
your word

617
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,998
at the most inopportune
times, brother.

618
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:12,583
We've been doing things
your way all day.

619
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:14,168
Come on.

620
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:16,821
Just one little snap,
and it's toodle-loo, Agnes.

621
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,406
She deserves it.

622
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:21,559
Niklaus, do not
make another move.

623
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,212
You have asked
for my forgiveness.

624
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:29,651
I will Grant you
that forgiveness,

625
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:32,686
but do not make me
break my word.

626
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:48,618
My noble brother.

627
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:52,406
How's that for
personal growth, eh?

628
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,792
Still, it is just like you
to spoil my fun.

629
00:33:57,462 --> 00:34:00,931
Oh, not necessarily.

630
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,767
Agh!

631
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:08,305
Aah!

632
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:19,567
I swore you
would not die

633
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,134
by my brother's hand.

634
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,907
I said nothing

635
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:27,457
of my own.

636
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,996
No one hurts
my family and lives.

637
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,970
No one.

638
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:58,039
Mm.

639
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:04,179
I've been away from this
home almost 100 years,

640
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,299
and you haven't changed
a thing in my bedroom.

641
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,352
I guess I was holding out
hope that you'd come back to it,

642
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,689
although I imagine it's
not quite as comfortable

643
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,474
as those beds
at the palace royale.

644
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:21,947
It's plenty
comfortable.

645
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:23,064
I'm famished.

646
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:30,289
Nah. Apples
aren't my thing.

647
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,207
They were your favorite
once upon a time.

648
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,525
Yeah. They were.

649
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:34,627
Get my ass beat
if I ever ate them

650
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:35,911
working
on that plantation,

651
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:38,080
even spoiled ones.

652
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,132
Now they just
remind me of a time

653
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,868
when I couldn't
have things.

654
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:45,970
Well, now you can have
whatever you want.

655
00:35:47,723 --> 00:35:50,476
Come with me.

656
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:51,843
And go where,
Rebekah?

657
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,479
Ever we want to.

658
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,147
We can build
a home together.

659
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:58,067
We can leave behind
Klaus and this city

660
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,235
and those orphan
Annie vampires.

661
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:03,405
Whoa, those orphan Annie
vampires are my family,

662
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:04,657
and this city
is my home.

663
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:07,159
It was my home,
too, once. I left.

664
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,729
You ran. I stayed.

665
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,565
This empire, it thrives
because of me,

666
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:16,451
and you want me
to run.

667
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:18,671
A man does not
run from his home.

668
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:19,838
I have lived
a lot longer

669
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,306
than you, marcellus.

670
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:24,076
I have seen kings
rise and fall.

671
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:26,261
If there is one thing
I know to be true,

672
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:29,264
it is that no matter how
big your empire becomes,

673
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:31,416
it is nothing

674
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:35,104
if you have no one
to share it with.

675
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:40,942
You want New Orleans,
have it.

676
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:47,515
I won't be here
to stop you.

677
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,250
Where is he?

678
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:06,335
I've been trying
to find him all day.

679
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:07,503
Marcel knows that
Niklaus lied

680
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:09,138
about where
he lives.

681
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:11,289
I'm not his damn
keeper, Josh.

682
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,560
Fine. Just tell him
to call me, please.

683
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,177
Ok.

684
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:30,024
Uh!
Oh! Ooh!

685
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:44,205
Oh, what the hell,
Josh?

686
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:47,325
Hi there.

687
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:50,846
I'm Marcel.

688
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,645
I don't think
we've met.

689
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:01,390
What are you
doing here?

690
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,642
Do you remember
the promise I made you?

691
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:05,777
Promise? No.

692
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,399
Yes.

693
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,901
You promised you'd find out
what happened to Sean.

694
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:15,871
And I kept my word.

695
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:17,940
Your twin brother's
behavior

696
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:20,542
was not born
of natural causes.

697
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:23,712
A witch hexed him to
commit those murders

698
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:26,098
and to kill himself.

699
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,217
I knew it.

700
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:32,503
I knew
he wasn't crazy.

701
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,590
Who is this witch?

702
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:37,259
Oh, you needn't trouble
yourself over her.

703
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,980
She has already paid for
her actions in blood.

704
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,600
What? Wait.
You killed somebody?

705
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:47,575
Well, I had a hand
in the matter, yeah.

706
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:52,524
Forgive me if I'm
a little surprised

707
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,725
by your reaction.

708
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:55,944
How the hell am I
supposed to react?

709
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:57,663
You just made me culpable
in a revenge murder

710
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,031
I never asked for.

711
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:01,166
I've been alive for
a thousand years,

712
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,868
and, I can assure you,
many people have died

713
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:04,503
for far less.

714
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:07,673
Besides, now you
can find comfort

715
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:09,758
in the truth.

716
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:13,846
The truth?
You compel me.

717
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:15,580
You make me at peace
with something

718
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,300
that should be
tearing me up inside.

719
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:22,604
I don't know how,
but I will undo

720
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:26,391
whatever the hell it is
you've done to me,

721
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:29,278
and when I do,
you're gonna wish

722
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,947
you never
laid eyes on me.

723
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:52,251
Hey...

724
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:54,720
Where you been?

725
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:58,306
Not still mad about our tiff
the other night, are you?

726
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,496
Water under the bridge.

727
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:07,182
Cami is all yours
if you're interested.

728
00:40:07,183 --> 00:40:08,817
I'm feeling like now
is not the right time

729
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:11,737
for me to pursue
a relationship.

730
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:14,907
Life is all about
timing, you know?

731
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:17,709
Speaking of, I swung
by your place earlier

732
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,161
to commiserate
over a drink,

733
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:22,531
but I must've
just missed you.

734
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:26,651
Oh, the palace royale
didn't suit me.

735
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:28,670
I moved on
weeks ago.

736
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:34,342
No. I mean
your other place.

737
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:46,221
Hayley.

738
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:48,673
Interesting location
to put down your roots,

739
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:53,478
same plantation
where I was a slave.

740
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:56,531
I guess that's why you
never invited me over.

741
00:40:56,532 --> 00:41:00,685
Well, how rude of me.
I'll speak to Elijah.

742
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:02,287
I'm sure he'll be
pleased to host

743
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,206
you and Davina
for the evening,

744
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,874
especially
after you were

745
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,409
so hospitable
to him.

746
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,083
Good.

747
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:19,971
I look forward to it.

748
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:32,985
Od-bye means
good-bye, Elijah.

749
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:34,569
Is she with you?

750
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,238
What the hell are
you talking about?

751
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,824
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

752
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:40,608
What?

753
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:44,495
Marcel was here.

754
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:55,172
