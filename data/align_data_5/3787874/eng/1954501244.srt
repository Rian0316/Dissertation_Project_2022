1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,488
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:05,999
I presume I have the misfortune
of speaking to my mother.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,603
I have come to heal our family.

4
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:10,353
I'd prefer you both to
join me against our mother,

5
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:12,355
but I'll happily
settle for one or the other.

6
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:14,056
It is time you bring Camille in.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,279
Esther prepared your body
for someone to jump into.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,847
She was preparing you
for Rebekah.

9
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:20,363
I have the baby,
and we're on the run.

10
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:21,883
Esther found us.

11
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:25,387
Then she made an offer
to make us all mortal again.

12
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:26,734
[Gasps]

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,595
Elijah: We mustn't let
the world ever hurt her.

14
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,525
You're right.

15
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:31,860
Those daggers
don't work on Klaus.

16
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,530
It's not impossible to change
the dagger itself, so here.

17
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,798
That's a giant diamond.

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,966
It's a paragon diamond.

19
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,382
Use them to conduct power.

20
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,369
Klaus, there's something
I need to tell you.

21
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,390
- You can tell me on the way.
- Where are we going?

22
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,539
To see our daughter.

23
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:48,675
[Singing Christmas carol]

24
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:16,236
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.

25
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,572
You sly old bat.

26
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,269
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.

27
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,740
This little beauty and I
have a date with a dagger.

28
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,909
Klaus: You're looking
very dapper this evening, Kol.

29
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,244
Though gloves
without a tailcoat.

30
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,413
Unusual, wouldn't
you say, Klaus?

31
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,148
I would unless
of course the gloves

32
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,950
are utilitarian in nature.

33
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:04,218
I didn't realize
you two lovebirds

34
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,653
were interested in fashion.

35
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:07,121
Oh, I can take it or leave it.

36
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:09,056
Mayor Behrman on the other hand,

37
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:11,258
now his style is impeccable,

38
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,593
especially under present duress.

39
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,795
Do you know he came
to me very concerned

40
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:17,063
about the rash of
thefts in the city?

41
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,732
So I put Marcel on it.

42
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,359
And after a little digging,
I formed a theory

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,279
as to the culprit,
so we followed our suspect.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,474
And he led us here
to the mansion

45
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:31,111
of the recently deceased
dowager fauline.

46
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,646
She was famous
for her collection

47
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:36,316
of rare and priceless jewels,
most notably of course

48
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:41,161
the perfect paragon diamond.

49
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,888
Hand it over, Kol.

50
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,901
[Chanting]

51
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:00,507
[Banging on doors]

52
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,708
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!

53
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:07,814
Oh, I wouldn't bother
waiting for them.

54
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:12,410
You see, those women are never
leaving that house again.

55
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,369
Merry Christmas, brother.

56
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,262
[Screaming]

57
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:28,125

58
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,518
Rebekah: Well, isn't
this place rather nice?

59
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,912
Nik must have compelled
a wine lover

60
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:42,055
to keep it up because
I found a 2005 bordeaux.

61
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,216
Fancy a sip?

62
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:44,784
I appreciate the sentiment,
Rebekah,

63
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:49,990
but I do recognize when I'm
being handled with kid gloves.

64
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,449
How are you feeling?

65
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,724
Patronized.

66
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,290
I am here to protect you.

67
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,799
I know you mean to, Elijah.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,734
And yet you found it necessary
to render me unconscious

69
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,148
before bringing me here.

70
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:04,587
Well, you weren't yourself,

71
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,965
and I needed to get us
out of that diner.

72
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,642
What happened back there?

73
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:11,276
I don't know.

74
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:18,330
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.

75
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:20,952
My job is to keep her safe.

76
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:27,559
Both: Pwoteje sa.

77
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,764
Scandalum subsisto venenatis.

78
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:36,320
Impedit l'ecoulement.

79
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,272
It's finished,
but I'm worried it's not enough

80
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,141
to protect Cami's body
from Esther's magic.

81
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:45,778
I might know a way to distract
you from your troubled mind.

82
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,146
Marcel: You can take
this seriously,

83
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,447
or I can lock you
in a coffin like

84
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:50,282
your brother Finn if you prefer.

85
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,635
Oh. No. I'd prefer
you to bugger off

86
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,638
because this spell needs
time to cook in peace.

87
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,356
Cami doesn't have time.

88
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,625
Esther can jump anybody
into her body right now.

89
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's
not gonna jump anybody, is she?

90
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,375
She's gonna jump Rebekah,

91
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:07,199
who just happens to be miles
away, but fair dues, Marcel.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,667
Think I'd be a bit testy, too,

93
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,736
if my old ex was about
to jump into my new ex.

94
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,530
I think that would be
a big, uh...

95
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,273
Awkward?

96
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,475
I was gonna say kinky, but...

97
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,745
I appreciate
the chivalry, Marcel,

98
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:23,482
but he'll have an easier time
protecting me if he's alive.

99
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,016
Keep working.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,155
What is it with you two?

101
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:34,302
It gets a bit old, plan
out in me own family.

102
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,429
You know, Klaus,
Elijah, Rebekah,

103
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,797
they were always a party of 3.

104
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,199
No room for me at the table.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,469
There always seemed to be
room for Marcel.

106
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,107
You know that diamond,
the one that I showed you?

107
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,173
Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:49,508
Well, that was the baby version.

109
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,142
The one that we need
to do the dagger spell,

110
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,946
well it has to be a lot bigger.

111
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:55,680
100 years ago,
I had it in my hand.

112
00:05:55,681 --> 00:06:00,151
Then Marcel ratted me out
to Klaus, and they took it.

113
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,871
He probably bloody well kept it.

114
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,372
So let's steal it back.

115
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,059
It's a good chance to snoop.

116
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,838

00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,713
You're making a mess of
my werewolf sentries, Mikael.

120
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:34,351
And you're up
to your old tricks.

121
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,151
Esther...

122
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,063
I missed you, wife.

123
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,708
Have you missed me?

124
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,502
As much as you've
missed me, I imagine.

125
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,005
That would explain why you
brought your lover back

126
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:55,258
from the other side without
so much as a thought of me.

127
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,677
I will slaughter
every single wolf I see

128
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:01,846
until I am taken to the dog

129
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,017
you saw fit to bring
back from the dead.

130
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:05,616
You can stop looking for ansel.

131
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,918
Klaus killed him.

132
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,353
Klaus may not be your blood,

133
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:10,621
be he certainly has
picked up a few things

134
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,789
from you along the way.

135
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,258
Do not mention the bastard son!

Resolution through violence.

137
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,718
You are nothing
if not consistent.

Go ahead. Strike me.
I imagine you've been

139
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,801
waiting a thousand years
to do so.

140

Now that you've got
that out your system,

143
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:39,342
we have things to discuss
about our children.

144
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,620
It's all right, Elijah.

145
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,256
She won't break.

146
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,492
Everything you did was in
the name of protecting her.

147
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:49,792
I'm not worried.

148
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:54,974
Is that what I think it is?

149
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:59,536
It's bonfire season,
and I am reviving a family tradition,

150
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:02,005
especially since we're
all going to be together.

151
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:05,161
Only because we're fleeing from
one of our deranged parents,

152
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:07,344
another Mikaelson
family tradition.

153
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,646
It's a peculiar thing

154
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:12,188
never to be tired
yet forever exhausted

155
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:15,619
with the sameness of things.

156
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,189
Why is our family always at war?

157
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,125
I don't know,
but being away with her

158
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,056
made me see things differently.

159
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,795
We're not so bad.

160
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:32,468
Not the monsters
that our parents think we are.

Curse on the first born?

164
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,166
What the bloody hell
is that supposed to be?

165
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,434
Well, according to Finn,
our sister freya

166
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,735
didn't die of plague.

167
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,853
She was taken as payment
by our aunt dahlia,

168
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,242
who then cursed all Mikaelson
first borns for eternity.

169
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:09,576
Is any of this true?

170
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,144
Elijah: It is if
we're to believe Finn,

171
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,280
who learned it from
that bastion of truth, our mother.

172
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,349
Well, no wonder Finn hates us.

173
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,550
He lost the sister
he adored and instead

174
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:20,053
got a judgy pack of siblings,
who found him unbearably dull.

175
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,655
Great. So is there
any chance of us

176
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,467
running into your loony
aunt dahlia anytime soon?

177
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,626
Fable's over
a thousand years old.

00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:25,470
She'll be vulnerable.

354
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,239
No. If we kill her,
she body jumps.

355
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
Then stop her from jumping.

356
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,809
If I knew how to bloody
stop her from jumping,

357
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,377
don't you think I would have
happily murdered her ages ago?

358
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:33,578
Well, ages ago, you didn't have

359
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,347
a harvest girl
or a Mikaelson witch.

360
00:20:35,348 --> 00:20:36,615
Kol knows all of her tricks.

361
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,038
Are you both insane?

362
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,719
Hardly, Elijah.
It was your idea.

363
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,787
You were the one who said
she needed a win,

364
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,322
and if we get this right,
then she'll have one.

365
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:47,492
And if we do it wrong, you're
no longer in your own body.

366
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,327
Would that be the worst thing?

367
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:52,630
You were ready
to do it yourself.

368
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,499
It was a foolish moment

369
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,006
and one that you sagely
dissuaded me from.

370
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,310
Hopefully, we'll get lucky

371
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,186
and stop the spell
before I jump.

372
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:04,776
And if we're not,
you get what you always wanted.

373
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,077
I mean, that's what
you're saying, isn't it?

374
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,609
You're willing to lose.

375
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,416
I'm willing to risk losing, yes.

376
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,011
Well, we need to find
someone for her to jump into,

377
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:16,452
someone anonymous,
someone who could disappear with hope.

378
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,690
Rebekah, we've been
together for centuries.

379
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,391
If you were human...

380
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,559
When I'm old and wrinkly,

381
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,661
you can dump me back
into my old body.

382
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:27,212
Nik already has a coffin
he can stall me in.

383
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:28,299
But to trust Kol?

384
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,034
It's not about trust, Elijah.

385
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,176
It's about finding
the proper leverage.

386
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,677
She's right.

387
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:36,841
Kol will do what's best for Kol.

388
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:40,309
We just have to meet his price.

389
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,977
Be happy to help.

390
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,314
In exchange for what?

391
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:44,782
From all the sneaking
around today,

392
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,684
you're clearly in need
of something.

393
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,151
If you want me to find
a new body for Rebekah,

394
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:52,723
I want the Fauline diamond you
stole from me back in 1914.

395
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:54,859
What do you plan to do with it?

396
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,026
Does it matter?

397
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,995
Well, it will matter to Klaus.

398
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:00,164
You see, I could fib here,

399
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:03,701
but I want to be
on the up about it.

400
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:07,481
I need a weapon I can use to
protect myself against Klaus,

401
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:10,047
and the diamond
helps me make it.

402
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,209
It's not kill him.
Simply a matter of self-defense

403
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,012
only to be use out
of absolute necessity.

404
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:18,716
It's a fair trade, Marcel.

405
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:20,618
I get free
of the whackadoodle mum,

406
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,920
I acquire the means by
which to defend myself

407
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,770
against a volatile brother,

408
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:28,192
should the need arise,
and, uh, well,

409
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,838
if all goes well,
perhaps you'll let me near Davina

410
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:32,820
without bodily harm.

411
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:35,264
So should I call him back,
or should you?

412
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,706
You are made to give
Kol that diamond.

413
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:45,227
Our little brother has been
plotting against me for years,

414
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,000
and he hasn't got
a lick of it right.

415
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,877
I'll take my chances.

416
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,671
Do you know what to do?

417
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:53,784
Yes, but if it
doesn't go to plan,

418
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,926
will you handle my body with care,
please?

419
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,637
I may miss the old model.

420
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:03,593
If everything goes south, I'll
be there to pull you out.

421
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:07,499
We just have to take Esther
down before she body jumps.

422
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:11,835
I don't want all of this
to have been for nothing.

423
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:14,771
You and I on the same team.

424
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,639
It must be Christmas.

425
00:23:26,716 --> 00:23:28,183
She's asleep.

426
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:35,458
It's so quiet with Klaus
and Rebekah gone.

427
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:39,562
So we didn't get to say
our wishes.

428
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:43,118
Can I tell you mine?

429
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:45,502
It's a hope actually

430
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:49,472
that you'll understand
what I have to tell you.

431
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,640
What is it?

432
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,508
My wolves...
I think I figured out

433
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,446
a way to release them
from the witches.

434
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:59,315
They could control
their turning without the rings

435
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,551
and bring peace to our home

436
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:04,827
so that hope could
return to us...

437
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,998
But there's a catch.

438
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:14,663
I have to marry Jackson.

439
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:25,308
It's, uh, a mystical ceremony
and an alpha bonding ritual.

440
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,512
Elijah, I know that you
and I haven't been close recently,

441
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:32,214
but...

442
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:35,526
You have to know that
this isn't about him.

443
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:39,279
I don't love Jackson,

444
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,859
but at the same time,
I couldn't marry him

445
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,128
and still be involved with you.

446
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:53,636
I don't know.
I should just...

447
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:56,471
[Music playing]

448
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:07,883
Marry him.

449
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:10,452
What?

450
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,555
Listen to me.

451
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:16,231
The only way that the city
will be safe for hope's return

452
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:18,460
is if you have unified
your people

453
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:21,071
and I have unified my own,

454
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:23,565
and Davina will eventually
lead her witches,

455
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:25,100
and whatever their goal may be,

456
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,770
she is no enemy to your child.

457
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:33,274
Do what you need to bring
your daughter home.

458
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:39,113
This is my wish for you.

459
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,626
Done! A per request.

460
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:17,185
Miss angelica barker.

461
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:21,381
Good cheek bones and a tummy
you can bounce a quarter off.

462
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:25,677
She will be Rebekah's new
host body instead of Cami.

463
00:26:25,678 --> 00:26:27,346
Who's angelica barker?

464
00:26:27,347 --> 00:26:29,348
One of my vampire potentials.

465
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:31,366
Had to turn her down.
She was too lost.

466
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:32,967
Does she know what's
about to happen to her?

467
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,728
It's better when
they don't know, luv.

468
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,189
Hopefully, we won't
have to use her.

469
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,732
Hopefully, but then my mother

470
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,676
is a wily and vindictive woman,

471
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:44,245
which is why I've got to
ask something else of you.

472
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,080
You're already getting
the diamond.

473
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:49,417
Which I'm thrilled about, but
in order for me to help you,

474
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:51,119
I need access to
my mother's hourglass,

475
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,915
which is in
the lycee with my mother.

476
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,124
So?

477
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,825
Well, I haven't been
back in a while,

478
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,193
and the only way she won't
suspect me is if I bring back

479
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,004
the thing that
I was sent to find.

480
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:02,896
And that thing is?

481
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:06,500
The white oak stake.

482
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,928
Are you out of your mind?

483
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:09,537
Kaleb!

484
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,505
Look. It's the only way
that she's gonna trust me.

485
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,807
She doesn't want to kill them.

486
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,442
She just wants to make
sure that the weapon

487
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:18,913
doesn't fall in the wrong hands.

488
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:20,448
I swear as soon as she's gone,

489
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,234
I'll give it
right back to Klaus.

490
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:24,518
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.

491
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,052
Klaus: Kol!

492
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:32,193
Whatever grudges
you hold against me,

493
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,903
we are doing this
for the good of our family.

494
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:39,166
Do I have your word that for
once you will honor that?

495
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,086
You have my word, Nik.

496
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:45,306
Swear on the fate of us all.

497
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:46,939
Take the stake.

498
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:57,488
I wooed her, I won her.

499
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:01,525
Took a while, but in the
end, she handed it to me.

500
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:02,759
When I didn't hear from you,

501
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,474
I thought you
might be in trouble.

502
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,997
Nope. No trouble.

503
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,432
Just hard to do espionage

504
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,334
when you're calling
mummy all the time.

505
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,170
So where's Finn.
Is he off playing emperor

506
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,272
to his merry pack of dogs?

507
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm afraid Finn may have fallen

508
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:18,675
into the hands of your brothers,

509
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:21,511
but I've made a plan to
assist him with that dilemma

510
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:25,115
while I continue
my search for Rebekah.

511
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:29,885
Oh. Speak of the devil,
and the devil will come.

512
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:31,793
Hello, sister.

513
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,358
Kol, it really is you.

514
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,974
I would know
that smirk anywhere.

515
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:44,191
Hello, mother.

516
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:45,857
I believe you're
offering a deal.

517
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:51,274
Kaleb will link this
hourglass to Esther's.

518
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:52,509
Ours will mirror hers.

519
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,979
When last sand falls, Esther
will try to jump her into you.

520
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,647
That's when I'll redirect
the spell from you to Esther.

521
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,215
It's meant to jam
the signal just long enough

522
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:01,782
to keep that kind of magic
from working against anyone.

523
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,919
If it works.

524
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,621
It will work.
When Rebekah attacks,

525
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:06,155
Esther won't be able
to jump her into you

or herself anywhere else.

527
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:10,050
And we're sure Kaleb
is on board?

528
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,197
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar,

529
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:14,678
but like Elijah,
he doesn't give his word lightly.

530
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,309
Rebekah: You can't possibly
expect me to discuss

531
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,337
giving up eternal life over tea.

532
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,438
Give me some of that
red over there.

533
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,673
Pfft.

534
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,445
Well, where's the sales pitch?

535
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,822
I only offer what
you already want.

536
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:33,382
And how do you presume
to know that?

537
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:36,853
Elijah is happiest when
there is order and music,

538
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:41,591
Klaus when he's the center
of attention and in control,

539
00:29:41,592 --> 00:29:47,463
but you are my only child
capable of unfettered joy,

540
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,299
and you're happiest
amongst humans.

541
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,669
I've seen you year for that life,
for love.

542
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,160
And when am I happiest
then, mother?

543
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,075
When you're doing
as you're told.

544
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:08,951
Our wishes are aligned
in this, my daughter,

545
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:13,255
mine to free you from this
curse and yours to be human.

546
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,190
I'd be giving up
everything I've ever known

547
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,126

of something I once was,

548
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:20,954
power for weakness,
strength for frailty,

549
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,874
eternal life for a brief
human existence.

550
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:27,669
The choice is simple.

551
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,174
Another thousand years of
never having what you want

552
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:36,823
or a handful of years
when you do.

553
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:48,924
Well, then.
To the end of an era.

554

is that doing here?

As each of you comes to your
senses and takes my offer,

560
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:25,268
I will destroy
your vampire bodies.

561
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,595
Mother, you said you wanted
the stake to protect them.

562
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,931
Yes, but not
in their current bodies.

563
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,734
Once they accept my offer, I
will be righting two wrongs...

564
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:34,027
No.

evil into the world

566
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:38,473
and having subjected
my own children to it.

567
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:39,674
No. That wasn't the deal.

568
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:40,875
Stop the spell!

569
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,111
The spell is already done.

570
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:44,779
I prepared it to be locked in

the hourglass.

573
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,093
Not yet.

574
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:00,461
Mother, think this through.

575
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,696
You gave birth to this body.

576
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:02,897
You can't destroy it.

577
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,500
I am only destroying its flesh.

578
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:08,769
Your beautiful soul will live
on in the body of another.

Nik, I didn't know
anything about it, I swear.

Oh, good. I'm glad you two
boys are friends again.

585
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:27,855
I did wonder what you'd been
up to in your time away.

Now I know.

588

I'm afraid that's impossible.

589

Anything is possible.

590
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:36,497
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!

591
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:39,738
If only you'd taken my offer
when it was still mine to give.

592
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:41,669
Unfortunately, you've
left me no choice

593
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,514
but to make a deal with Mikael.

594
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,850
Mikael?

595
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:52,042
When Finn and Kol went
missing, I needed a new ally.

596
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,231
All he wanted was
the right to kill you.

597
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:01,588
Kol, I would ask you to deliver
the stake to your father,

598
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:04,825
but it seems your loyalties
have been compromised.

599

Stop the spell, Esther!

600
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,872
No. It's ok, Nik.
I can do this.

extra precautions.

in such a good mood?

had done me a solid back in 1914?

Swore she hadn't told Klaus
that I was taking the diamond back.

a bit facetious.

with us the tradition

the dowager Fauline cottage.

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,158
Kol. Damn it!

703
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:52,161
I'm not meant to be here.

704
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:54,797
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!

705
00:41:54,798 --> 00:41:57,967
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!

706
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,001
Let me out!
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!

707
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:05,895
