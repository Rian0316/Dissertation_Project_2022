00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:02,667
<i>Kids, as long as I'd known 
your Uncle Barney,</i>

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,468
<i>he'd always had some
pretty strong opinions</i>

3
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:05,767
<i>on relationships</i>

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,034
Your girlfriend?

5
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:08,167
<i>She's your girl friend?!</i>

6
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:11,567
She's a girl
and a friend?

7
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:12,900
(laughs)

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,201
Donâ€™t humanize
the enemy, Ted.

9
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,633
But nice to meet you.

10
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:17,800
Barney Stinson.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,734
<i>And yet,
in the fall of 2009,</i>

12
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:21,667
<i>he was the one
with the girlfriend.</i>

13
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,101
Go ahead.
Open it.

14
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,067
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

15
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,967
It's my porn collection!

16
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:29,368
Just kidding.
That would be weird.

17
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,234
It's your porn collection.

18
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,701
It's my porn collection!
I'm giving you my porn.

19
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,968
Now that things are
so great with Robin,

20
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,400
I don't need it anymore.

21
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,334
Wow, you are voluntarily...

22
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,367
giving up your porn?

23
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,834
You really are serious.

24
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,133
Yeah, well, that's obvious.
What does that mean?

25
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,501
Oh, nothing,
it's just, you know,

26
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,701
you got relationship gut.

27
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:52,868
What?! No, I do not
"got relationship gut."

28
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,234
That is ridiculous.

29
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,767
It's no big deal. I mean, once you're
dating someone,

30
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,734
it's natal to let
things go a little bit.

31
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,534
Trust me,
we've been there.

32
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,934
Yeah. Boy, did i 
pudge you out for a while.

33
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,167
Well, we should get going.

34
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,267
Good-bye, my sweet,
beloved friends.

35
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,301
You have always
been there for me.

36
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,334
You'll be missed.

37
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,734
He's talking to the porn.

38
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,900
Oh.
(chuckles)

39
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,301
Bye, Robin. See you, Robs.
Bye, guys.

40
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:20,067
God, look at these videos.

41
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,267
<i>Space Orgy?</i>

42
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,900
<i>Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23?</i>

43
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,600
You'd think after
the first 22 parties,

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,934
the co-eds wouldn't be
surprised anymore.

45
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,034
So, uh...

46
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,667
we can get rid
of these for you.

47
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,634
Yeah.
No. No-no-no-no-no-no.

48
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,100
It's not a problem.
I'll-I'll take care of them.

49
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,367
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,501
I mean, no biggie. We can just
swing by the back alley

51
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,868
and drop the box
in the Dumpster.

52
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,667
I see six of the words you just
id on this video label.

53
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,067
Seriously, it's not a big deal.
I will take care of it.

54
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,234
No, 'cause I, I mean...
Leave them!

55
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,434
Okay.

56
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:52,334
You know, in a way
it sad, right?

57
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:54,100
I mean, Barney's
giving up his porn.

58
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,367
He's got relationship gut.

59
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,601
They eat at the same
diner every night.

60
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,734
It-it's, like, the end of Barney Stinson
as we know him.

61
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,834
Yeah, well, so what? They're happy.
Yeah, well, we gotta go.

62
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,534
Later. Bye.
Bye-bye.

63
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,901
<i>(whispers):
So what'd you get?
I got Squat.</i>

64
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,133
What are you...?
I thought I saw you take one.

65
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,133
<i>Yeah, I did.
It's called Squat.</i>

66
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,968
Hmm...

67
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,567
<i>ArchiSexTure.</i>

68
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,634
That is not how you spell
"Buckminster Fuller."

69
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,234
<i>Kids, pornography is bad,</i>

70
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,300
<i>and so I was
getting rid of that</i>

71
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
<i>vile pornography right away...</i>

72
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,400
I am getting rid of this vile
pornography right away.

73
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>...when something terrible
happened.</i>

74
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,267
Oh, no.

75
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,934
Oh, no.

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,267
(sensual music from TV begins)

77
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,567
Oh, no.

78
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,968
Oh, no.

79
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,301
<i>WOMAN (on video):
ArchiSexTure...</i>

80
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:02,334
Hello, Ted.

81
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,934
If you are watching this tape--
and I knew you'd pick this one--

82
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,334
then you are now
in possession of my porn.

83
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,167
This can only mean
one of two things:

84
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,134
either I'm dead, or m
in a committed relationship.

85
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:16,201
If I'm dead,
I want you to honor my memory

86
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,934
by taking my body
to the Hamptons

87
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,434
<i>and recreating
Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

88
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,533
I want to dance.

89
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,767
I want to have sex with a girl.

90
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,001
And I want to go fishing.

91
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,500
If, on the other hand, I'm
in a committed relationship,

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,134
then as your best friend,
I have only one request:

93
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,334
please, for the love of God,

94
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,468
get  out of it!

95
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:47,834

96
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,367
I might look happy,
but don't believe it.

97
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,233
Barney Stinson
is meant to be single.

98
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,634
So please, if you value

99
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,867
my best-friendship--
that's right, Marshall,

100
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm his best friend,
how does that feel?--

101
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,267
then get me out of this.

102
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:10,801
And finally, since you were
expecting some porn...

103
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,434
No, no, no baby,
don't worry.

104
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:20,001
The flashing green
light means it's off.

105
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:24,300
Are we sure he was
finished talking?

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,434
Look, there's
reason we should

107
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,000
take this seriously, right?
Of course not.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,367
This is an old tape.

109
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,234
Barney is happy with Robin.

110
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:35,234
<i>But over the next couple weeks,
I started to notice things.</i>

111
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,867
<i>Barney and Robin stopped having
crazy adventures.</i>

112
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:39,501
So what'd you guys
do last night?

113
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,067
I wanted to go
to a concert.

114
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,468
He wanted to go
to a party.

115
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,633
Obviously, we couldn't
do what just one of us wanted,

116
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,767
so we just stayed in,
watched a movie on

117
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,700
<i>It was Legen--
wait for it--</i>

118
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,267
<i>ds of the Fall.</i>

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
<i>Legends of the Fall!</i>

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
It was okay.

121
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,501
<i>Barney stopped being himself.</i>

122
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,468
Hey, Barney, I'm, uh, I'm
chatting up this girl

123
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,000
over there, and I could use a
little help landing the plane.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own
wingman tonight.

125
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,134
<i>And Robin got annoyed
at everything he said.</i>

126
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,667
So, how are u two?

127
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,334
So great.
Oh... shut up.

128
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,067
Relationships are the best.
Shut up.

129
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:24,601
Shut up, shut up, shut up...
The sharing, the compromise, 

130
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,534
The monogamy, can't beat it.
Catchphrase! Yes!

131
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,667
<i>But the worse they got...</i>

132
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,034
I'm full... sweetie.

133
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,367
<i>...the more they kept saying
things were great.</i>

134
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,733
<i>Now, the truth is,
Barney and Robin</i>

135
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,334
<i>only kind of let themselves go
a little bit.</i>

136
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>But I swear, after a few more weeks,</i>

137
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>to us, they seemed like this.</i>

138
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,701
I'll be there...

139
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:50,634
in a minute.

140
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,200
Hey.

141
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,400
They're killing each other.
They love each other.

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,901
Barney and Robin
love each other,

143
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,567
but they're not Barney
and Robin anymore.

144
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,101
They're the fat guy
and the old lady.

145
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,567
My favorite '70s detective show.

146
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,967
Look, it's so ear.

147
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,333
Barney's been overeating

148
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,333
because he hates being
tied down like this.

149
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,200
And Robin's stressing out
because she hates

150
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
what Barney's turned into.

151
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
No, they're a perfect match.

152
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,434
Well, maybe that's the problem.

153
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:17,801
Maybe they're too similar.

154
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:18,834
It must be tough having

155
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,867
two alpha dogs
in one relationship.

156
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:21,967
We have two alpha dogs in our relationship.

157
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,567
Sure we do, sweetie.

158
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,734
If they're not happy,

159
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,200
why don't they just break up?

160
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,333
Because they're too stubborn.

161
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,233
Neither one of them
wants to be the first

162
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,467
to admit that they want out.

163
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,934
They're playing
Relationship Chicken.

164
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,934
I think Barney ate
the relationship chicken.

165
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,267
(laughing)

166
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,634
Ted, it's just a rough patch.

167
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,200
It takes time getting used
to being with someone else.

168
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,434
And they're both...

169
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,600
What the nice word for selfish?
Independent.

170
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,600
Independent.

171
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,267
Every relationship
goes through this.

172
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,400
It's true, um,
I have this astronaut friend--

173
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,134
totally loved his fiancÃ©e.

174
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,534
And then, the day before his
mission she caught him

175
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,967
with, like, four other chicks,
a couple of dudes.

176
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,534
Things got really tense.

177
00:06:58,534 --> 00:06:59,801
Um, finally, she ended up

178
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,034
sneaking onto the space
shuttle...

179
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,367
<i>Are you talking about Space Orgy?
Yes, I am.</i>

180
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,600
Ted, it's just a rough patch.

181
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,934
Just let things
run their course.

182
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,500
She's right.
But...

183
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,168
Two-to-one, Ted.
Leave them alone

184
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:13,467
<i>So I did leave them alone.
But that weekend...</i>

185
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,068
(sighs)

186
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,867
Have you noticed how beef ribs
used to always be disgusting,

187
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,500
and then recently,
they found a way

188
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,267
to make them really
delicious instead?

189
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,634
Okay, Barney, I'm going to go
ahead and ask you this head-on

190
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,301
Are you happy with Robin?

191
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,534
Are you kidding?!

192
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,301
How could I not be happy
with Robin?

193
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,833
It's Robin!
So are you happy?

194
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,800
I can't believe you would even
ask me that.

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,767
I mean, yes,
we fight all the time,

196
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:40,067
but you know what they say
about relationships:

197
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,800
Every moment's a battle.

198
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,168
So are you happy?
Do you know what goes

199
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,367
hand in hand with fighting?

200
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,367
The makeup sex.

201
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,367
Which is different

202
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,500
when you're in a loving,
long-term relationship.

203
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,600
Heads we have sex,

204
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,233
tail we order a whole pizza
and just lay here moaning.

205
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,233
Oh, great.
Let the coin decide.

206
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,300
Which was pizza again?
Tails.

207
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,567
It was tails.

208
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,300
Sex-- am I right?

209
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Thank God that's mostly over.

210
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,701
(hiccups)

211
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,901
I'm still hungry.

212
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,434
You hungry?

213
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,667
We have to break them up.

214
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,267
You're right.
Barney and Robin

215
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,767
are miserable together,

216
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,167
but they're too stubborn
to admit it.

217
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,034
So we had to get them
to break up.

218
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,034
How do we do that?
We unleash...

219
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,234
the Kraken.

220
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,733
<i>Kids, as you know,
earlier that year</i>

221
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,900
<i>I'd learned that Lily had
broken up not one,</i>

222
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,167
<i>not two, but seven
of my past relationships.</i>

223
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,067
Forget it.
I'm retired.

224
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,467
I'm out of the game.
But nobody's better than you.

225
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:53,568
I'm telling you,
I swore off that rocket.

226
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,800
I've gone legit.

227
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,733
I'm a matchmaker now.

228
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,734
Set me up with someone.
Whoa, I'm just starting out.

229
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,667
Please. You've, you've
got to break them up.

230
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,867
This relationship
is killing them.

231
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,801
I know it is,
but I've learned my lesson.

232
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,267
No more interfering.

233
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,801
Let things run their course.

234
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,634
It's two-to-one.
Yes, but t one is me.

235
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,168
All right, we don't need her.

236
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,134
We can break them up on our own.
How?

237
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:19,801
Okay remember when
Robin and I were dating?

238
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,934
What was the one big thing that
really freaked her out?

239
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:26,200
No, no, no, no, no--Ted, you can't.

240
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,333
No! No-no-no!

241
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,400
What are you talking about?

242
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,034
This! This is
what I'm talking about.

243
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,267
What is this doing
in my champagne?

244
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,367
If we make Robin think

245
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,001
for even a second
that Barney is proposing,

246
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,400
she'll lose it
and they'll break up.

247
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,034
That's crazy.
Why don't we just,

248
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,333
uh, like, lead Barney
into temptation?

249
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,634
We'll find some hot woman
hit on him...

250
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,801
Okay, the ring thing.

251
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,434
Stakeout van.
What?

252
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,700
We should've gotten
a stakeout van.

253
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,900
We could've ordered pizza,

254
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,067
look through
big binoculars and said,

255
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,434
"This ain't what I signed up
for," stuff like that.

256
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,000
Shh, here
comes the waiter.

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Please shut up.

258
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,934
What?

259
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,401
Oh, I thought
you said something, sorry.

260
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,134
Is that an engagement ring?

261
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you...?

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,467
Oh, no. No.
That is not .

263
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,568
They must have delivered it
to the wrong table.

264
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,934
Can you imagine

265
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,733
us getting married?

266
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,134
Well, we are committed
to each other.

267
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,733
Most of your stuff is

268
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,767
already at my apartment.

269
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,000
It might make taxes easier.

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,634
It'd speed up your citizenship.

271
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,700
"Scherbatsky"
is so hard to spell.

272
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,067
My mom would be so happy.

273
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:46,034
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, no reason not to.

274
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:49,134
We're getting married!
Not so loud, geez.

275
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,167
What did you do?

276
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,833
I am furious right now!

277
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,967
This is so wrong!

278
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,301
Lily, will you be
my maid of honor?

279
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,267
Oh, my God! I would love to!

280
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,567
Are you out of your mind?!

281
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,934
You knew they were playing
Relationship Chicken,

282
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:03,934
And what did you do?

283
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:06,801
You put an engagement ring
in front of them!

284
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,500
Okay, that's it.

285
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm taking over.

286
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,333
Coming out of retirement
for one, last breakup.

287
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,634
Oh-ho! All right.
Oh, yes!

288
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,634
How are we going to do it?

289
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,734
These guys are in so deep,

290
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,134
just one fight
ain't going to do it.

291
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:20,134
We need

292
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,300
to reignite
the four biggest fights

293
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,333
they've ever been in
all at once.

294
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,601
Number one:
The Battle of the Dirty Dishes.

295
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:34,967
Number two:
The Ex-Girlfriend Conflict.

296
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,167
(laughing)
Hey.

297
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,833
Don't you know
that girl over there?

298
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,733
No, I don't think .

299
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,967
(cell phone drops)
No, in fact,

300
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,634
I have definitely not--
Oh, hey, it's Meg.

301
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,967
Wow, I am certainly not comparing you two
in my mind right now.

302
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,334
Whoops! Hey, will you get that for me, please?
Really?

303
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,601
What's the problem? I'm not... Why do you keep-- 
You're embarrassing me in public.

304
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,367
Youâ€™re constantly putting me in these positions.
Oh, my God...

305
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,900
<i>Number three:
The Star Wars Altercation.</i>

306
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,367
Isn't it time you got
rid of your stupid doll?

307
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,167
It's not a doll.
It's a Storm Trooper.

308
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,134
Uh, he's wearing a diaper.

309
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,767
It's not a diaper, Robin,
it's protective armor.

310
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,534
Storm Trooper?
More like storm-pooper.

311
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,767
Stop it. <i>(blows raspberry):</i>
Oh!

312
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,833
Oh, it sounds like
your storm-pooper here

313
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,034
needs a changing. Okay, you know what?
I'm sick of it.

314
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,234
What? I didn't say anything. I'm sick of the jokes--
the joke about the magic,

315
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,833
the joke about the stormtrooper...
I can't... I can't joke?

316
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,634
And of course the biggie:

317
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,000

Who the hell was 
that old lady singing?

320
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:33,034
Okay, you know that Neil Young
is my favorite musician.

321
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,100
Right. Now, was that the same
old lady who played

322
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,967
Archie Bunker's wife
in All in the Family,

323
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,100
or just sound-alike?

324
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,967
Neil Young is
a Canadian treasure.

325
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,534
Do not make fun of Neil Young.

326
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,434
Robin, I would
never make fun of

327
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,100
a defenseless old lady with
vocal cord paralysis... ever.

328
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,967
Oh, here we go. In public?
Really? In public?
Yeah, in public. I'll go there.

329
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,467
What's the problem? Everything
I say...
We're gonna have a fight in public?

330
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,534
I got it.

331
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,534
I got it.
We e-mail them pictures

332
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,467
reminding them
of each of these fights.

333
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,434
You child.

334
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,700

335
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,668

00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:24,934
<i>the Canada-U.S. fight.</i>

349
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,634
<i>Right at that moment,</i>

350
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,134
<i>Crazy Meg shows up.</i>

351
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>Then, a stormtrooper happens
to walk by the window.</i>

352
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,233
<i>And just when they can't take
anything more,</i>

353
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>a busboy walks by</i>

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,068
<i>with a tray full of what?</i>

355
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,934
<i>Dirty dishes.</i>

356
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,333
("Murder Train" begins)

357
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,801
* Murder

358
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,801
* Climb aboard
the murder train... *

359
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,333
Lily.

360
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,600
This is your masterpiece.

361
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
We're getting a stakeout van!

362
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,934
A station wagon?

363
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:59,634
Really? You rented
a station wagon?

364
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,500
Yeah, a van cost,
like, 25 bucks more.

365
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,867
A station wagon?

366
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,867
Greetings, Will Robinson!

367
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,667
Where's the birthday
boy or girl?

368
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,434
Hey, climb on in.

369
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,567
What the hell is this?

370
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh, they didn't have
any stormtroopers,

371
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,934
so I had to get a different
robot; this'll still work.

372
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,200
Different robot?

373
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,034
Stormtroopers
aren't robots.

374
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,267
Of course
they're robots!

375
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,500
"Must kill Luke Skywalker."

376
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,534
<i>Um, nobody says that
in Star Wars at all, ever.</i>

377
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,267
That's a really lousy
robot voice, honey.

378
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,168
Someone order an
extra large sausage?

379
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,134
Hey, one of Barney's videos
starts off just like that.

380
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,934
Hey, guys, Barney's ordering...
five of something.

381
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:35,300
I don't know if
it's gonna fit in here.

382
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,600
Okay, now you're
just quoting the video.

383
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,667
Still ordering.

384
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,500
Waiter's taking out
a second pad.

385
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,834
Yeah, okay, well,
we need it in here.

386
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:42,867
We're on a stakeout.

387
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,233
Shouldn't you be in a van?

388
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,500
Thank you!
A van cost more.

389
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,168
Score me a slice, Will Robinson!
No, no-no-no!

390
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,800
You get a stain on that costume,
they're gonna charge us.

391
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,301
Dude, will you just chill
about money?

392
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,001
Yeah, let the stormtrooper
have a slice.

393
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,101
BOTH:
It's not a stormtrooper!

394
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,801
Hi, Lily

395
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,934
Sorry I'm late.
I was looking for a van.

396
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,834
Thank you!
$25!

397
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,034
So should I go
say hi to Robin?

398
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,134
Oh, not yet;
get in the car.

399
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:07,267
Okay, so wait,
wait, wait.

400
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,400
When they blew up
the Death Star,

401
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,901
knowing full well
there were thousands

402
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:13,400
of stormtroopers on it,
those were people?

403
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,034
It was called
the Death Star, baby.

404
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:17,034
They knew what
they were getting into.

405
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,200
Look, I don't want to play
the "I'm Alan Thicke" card,

406
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,534
but I really do have a dinner
to get to.

407
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,233
Someone has got to
take this sausage!

408
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,967
Okay, were you in that video?

409
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,601
Were you the guy
with the farmer tan?

410
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,000
Jonesin' for some 'za,
Will Robinson!

411
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,634
Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!

412
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:32,634
This ain't what I signed up for.

413
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:35,367
Hey! That's what...
Hey, you know what? Everyone, stop!

414
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,800
Alan Thicke, shut up! Marshall,
it's a station wagon.

415
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,467
Get over it!
Ted, stop talking about porn!

416
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:41,634
And for the love of God,

417
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,568
somebody get the stormtrooper
some pizza!

418
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,100
TED & MARSHALL:
It's not a stormtrooper!

419
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,733
Crap!

420
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,301
They see us!

421
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:51,302
Danger! Danger!

422
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:58,134
(whispers):
Are you sure they saw us?

423
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,568
(whispers): Yes.
Hey!

424
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:00,733
(screams)

425
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,434
Can I go talk to Barney now?
I'm so excited!

426
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,833
Do you really think
he's going to propose to me?

427
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,367
Oh, honey...

428
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,167
Forget it, Crazy Meg,
we've been made.

429
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,634
If we try anything now,
they're going to know it's us.

430
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,801
I, I think we should all just
go home...
No!

431
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:14,767
This is my masterpiece.

432
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,133
So what if they saw us?

433
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,367
It'll still work.

434
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,667
Stop it. We'll think
of something else.

435
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,334
Let me repeat:
"I am Alan Thicke."

436
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,801
(gasps):
You're Alan Thicke?!

437
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,968
No.

438
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:28,133
Alan Thicke, you're up.
Get on out there.

439
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,334
<i>NARRATOR:
And so, Lily followed
through with her plan.</i>

440
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,534
<i>First, Alan Thicke.</i>

441
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:37,200
<i>Followed by Crazy Meg.</i>

442
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,767
<i>Then, the robot.</i>

443
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,567
<i>And finally, the dirty dishes.</i>

444
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:46,900
<i>But by the end of it...</i>

445
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,900
LILY:
They're kissing?

446
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,334
They shouldn't be kissing!

447
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,867
Why isn't this working?

448
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,600
Because they're in love.

449
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,767
It really was
just a rough patch.

450
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,001
What the hell am I doing?

451
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,601
This whole thing was a mistake.

452
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,033
So, uh,

453
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,133
any of you dudes
want to get high?

454
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,467
I never thought I'd be
saying this tonight, but...

455
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,534
to Barney and Robin,
the happy couple.

456
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:18,868
(glasses clinking)

457
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,367
<i>That was the moment we learned</i>

458
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,701
<i>that relationships
take hard work,</i>

459
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,567
<i>but eventually,
everything will work out.</i>

460
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,533
Oh, hey!
Where's Barney?

461
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,434
Uh, we broke up.

462
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:31,001
<i>And that was the moment
we unlearned that other lesson</i>

463
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,034
<i>we had just learned
a few seconds earlier.</i>

464
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,500
<i>You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought</i>

465
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,567
<i>Barney and Robin
had spotted her,</i>

466
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,334
<i>this is what they really saw.</i>

467
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,334
Why do that fat guy
and old lady keep sta...?

468
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:50,401
Oh, my God. That's us!

469
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,533
Look at us.

470
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,234
Did  always look this awful?

471
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,301
Robin, I'm not happy.

472
00:17:58,301 --> 00:17:59,767
I mean,

473
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,767
I wish I was.
Nothing would make me happier

474
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,567
than being happy, but...

475
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,201
I'm not.

476
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:08,101
What are we doing wrong?

477
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,267
We love each other.

478
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,234
I mean, if this don't work,
what will?

479
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,700
We're so similar.

480
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,334
We both like scotch.
We're both awesome.

481
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,101
You know, maybe that's it.

482
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,201
Maybe there's just
too much awesome here.

483
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,934
Exactly.

484
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,234
Two awesomes
cancel each other out,

485
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,900
and I'm tired of being
cancelled out.

486
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
Me, too.

487
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,234
Are we breaking up?

488
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,301
I think so.

489
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,101
Ah, crap.

490
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,967
Now comes the next part.

491
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:44,167
The part where you and can't
go back to being friends.

492
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,468
Well, maybe this isn't
a breakup.

493
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:52,967
Maybe this is two friends

494
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,500
getting back together.

495
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
ALAN THICKE: Robin!
Ooh!

496
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,034
Alan...

497
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,468
Oh, it's always so great
to see a fellow hoser.

498
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,567
Yes! Oh, is true.
MEG: Barney!

499
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,934
Good news!
I forgive you

500
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,468
for the whole
restraining order thing.

501
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,334
Uh, hi.

502
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,434
Whoa, is that a stormtrooper?

503
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,667
That's not a stormtr...
You want to get out of here?

504
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,201
Yeah.

505
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,468
See you guys.
Okay.

506
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:19,500
See you, Alan.

507
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,101
(chuckling)

508
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:22,967
So you still on 73rd Street?

509
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:26,001
How do you know that?

510
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,567
Getting back together

511
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,734
as friends... I like that.

512
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,734
One more for the road?

513
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:41,300
And, I mean, who knows?

514
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
Maybe, when,
like, you turn 40,

515
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,234
if you haven't found anyone...

516
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,767
Oh, I already have
that deal with Ted.

517
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,734
Oh, right. Stupid.

518
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,467
Well, maybe when you turn 39,

519
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,801
if you haven't
found anyone...

520
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:54,467
<i>It turns out
that they really did</i>

521
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,834
<i>just need to let things
run their course.</i>

522
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,334
So, uh, how's Barney doing?

523
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,734
He's okay, I think.

524
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,734
It might be a while before
he fully recovers, but. Ooh!

525
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,534
Did you guys just feel a chill?

526
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:06,767
Yeah.

527
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:23,768
Daddy's home.

528
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,867
Well, Robin,
I'm glad we could catch up.

529
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,134
Oh, yeah, let's
do it again soon.

530
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:33,101
I love that you guys
are still friends

531
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,101
so long after you
did that music video.

532
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,067
Yeah.
The music?

533
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,767
Oh, the "Sandcastles"
video, yes!

534
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,700
<i>Yes, we did that
together, too.</i>

535
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,934
What do you mean "too"?
Oh, we had this

536
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:46,567
failed Canadian
TV variety show we did.

537
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,200
That was so embarrassing.

538
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,801
Imagine what would happen
if anybody ever got
their hands on that?

539
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,501
(chuckling)

540
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,634
Oh, you.

541
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:01,400
