爆

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,330
炸

15
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,330
第八季  第十集

16
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,540
大家好
Hello.

17
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,530
我是謝爾頓·庫珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

18
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,070
歡迎收看由謝爾頓·庫珀出品的《有趣的旗幟》
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags,

19
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,950
最終集  壯麗的旗幟
the Final Episode Flagtacular.

20
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,850
我知道會有拉炮  還是嚇死人家了  
I knew it was coming. Still scary.

21
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,330
我知道你們一定在想"居然最終集了
Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "The final episode?

22
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,180
是誰要害你們變成旗幟盲了"
who will stand between us and flag ignorance"

23
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,690
像我就有這個想法
I know I was thinking that.

24
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,620
這是旗幟節目還是讀心節目啊
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

25
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,380
但事實上是因為我無法繼續兼顧全職工作
But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career,

26
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,170
熱門網絡節目  以及女朋友了
a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.

27
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,690
他是真的有女朋友  你們這些留言的混球們
And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.

28
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,450
常言道  天下無不散之筵席
So as they say, all good things must come to an end.

29
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,650
雖然僅有232集視覺饗宴
After only 232 episodes.

30
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,930
如果某人有次
233 if we include the one

31
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,070
沒忘了按下錄制鍵  那應該是233集
somebody forgot to press record on.

32
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,090
說好了不提那事兒
You said you weren't gonna bring that up.

33
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,390
說好了你會按錄制鍵
And you said you pressed record.

34
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,550
總之  用放松的姿勢  
Anyway, please sit back, relax,

35
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,020
跟著我們一起跑完這最后一圈
and join us as we take our final lap...

36
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,750
就像這只賽車旗指示的一樣
...as indicated by the waving of this racing flag.

37
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,420
{\an8}白旗在不同系列車賽中有不同意義
有些代表場上有慢速車輛  有些則是最后一圈

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,420
當然  白旗也代表"舉白旗投降"
And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender,

39
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,450
剛鐸宰相  日本源氏也都使用白旗
the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan,

40
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,120
{\an8}剛鐸宰相  《魔戒》中剛鐸地區的統治者
日本源氏與平家大戰時  一家白旗  一家紅旗

41
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,120
但想必你們肯定還記得這些
but I'm sure you remember that from episode 62,

42
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,400
因為62集"白旗  誰舉白旗及緣由"都講過
"White Flags: Who's Wavin' 'Em and Why""

43
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,630
那集超贊
That was a good one.

44
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,570
的確是贊到爆炸
It was so good.

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,770
我本來以為清理過世教授的
You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,430
辦公室會很無聊
was gonna just be boring,

47
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,630
不過在我發現他的假牙后
but then I found his dentures

48
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,890
我才意識到是無聊加惡心
and realized it's also gross.

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,110
艾伯特教授的家人不想要這些東西嗎
Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?

50
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,420
我記得他好像沒家人
I don't think he had a family.

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,050
-真慘  -是啊
- That's rough. - I know.

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,970
一生都奉獻給了工作
You can spend your whole life working,

53
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,640
最后留下的只有盒子里的一些研究資料
and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,630
不禁讓你思索人生
Makes you think.

55
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,370
算了吧
Oh, well.

56
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,090
我們都得仔細檢查過這些東西
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff

57
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,850
以確保不會扔掉什么重要資料
before we throw it away in case it's important.

58
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,570
看啦  不是太舊就是被拒[反證]的
I-I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

59
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,240
不一定哦  這支舊筆"證明"了重力存在
I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity.

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,560
翻轉過來  小人偶的泳衣就掉下來
When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,510
我爸以前也有一支這樣的筆
Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that.

62
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,290
我整個六年級都跟它"約"會
I dated it all through sixth grade.

63
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,830
還是感覺很奇怪
It still feels weird

64
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,730
就這樣把這些研究成果都扔掉
just throwing away his work like this.

65
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,880
不用難過
Don't feel bad.

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,710
未來某天  也會有人來扔你的研究報告
Someday, someone will be throwing out your work, too.

67
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,260
那個人就是謝爾頓  而那個某天是昨天
That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday.

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,900
你們瞧
Hey, look at this.

69
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,250
"親愛的羅杰  在你獲得首次重大發現時開
"Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery.

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,890
愛你  媽"
Love, Mom."

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,320
瞧瞧這日期
Wow, look at the date.

72
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,300
他留了整整50年  卻從沒有機會開
He saved this 50 years and never got to open it.

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,100
真是讓人惋惜
That's intense.

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,190
可憐的羅杰·艾伯特
Poor Roger Abbott.

75
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,570
羅杰特聽起來像羅杰兔
Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.

76
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,570
{\an8}兔子羅杰是小說與電影的一個卡通人物

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,560
羅杰特  羅杰特  羅杰兔
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit.

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,220
天啊  萊納德  我知道這對死者不敬
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead,

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,310
不過你念念看  超好笑啊
but try it. It's fun!

80
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,720
羅杰特  羅杰特  羅杰兔
Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit...

81
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,110
佩妮
Penny!

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,500
我的年度最佳新人
Oh, my rookie of the year.

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,160
丹  我一開始不想雇我
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,120
但現在超愛抱我的老板
and now's a little hug machine.

85
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,690
看看你  新加入不久就業績第三名
Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.

86
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,530
-過來我那桌坐坐吧  -我馬上過去
- Why don't you come over to my table. - Yes. I'll be right there.

87
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,540
伯納黛特還在停車
Bernadette's just parking the car.

88
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,230
太好了
Oh, good.

89
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,740
伯納黛特  人萌音甜
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

90
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,320
惡毒兇殘的小伯納黛特
vicious little Bernadette.

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,410
別這樣嘛  她沒那么壞
Come on. She's not that bad.

92
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,180
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

93
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,700
公司野餐的時候  她吼了我跟我孫子
At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson

94
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,990
因為我們輸了二人三腿賽跑
for losing the three-legged race.

95
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,540
我孫子現在還叫她為"毒舌大奶娃"
I mean, he still calls her "That mean kid with the big boobies."

96
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,410
她有時候是有點兇  但我保證
I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear,

97
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,490
等稍微熟了之后   她就是很親切的一個人了
she is so sweet once you get past all the...

98
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,770
你們在聊什么
Hey, what are you talking about?

99
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,870
我們在聊有多喜歡跟你共事
We were just talking about how much we love working with you.

100
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,960
對吧
Isn't that right?

101
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,420
丹
Dan?

102
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,230
在《有趣的旗幟》的這些歲月里
Over the years here at Fun With Flags,

103
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,880
我們有機會一同學習  歡笑  驚奇
we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,470
甚至落過幾滴淚
And, yes, even shed a tear or two.

105
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,260
比如國慶節做了兩小時特別節目
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,780
結果卻沒被錄下來
and it doesn't get recorded.

107
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,010
到底要我道歉幾次才夠
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

108
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,120
先來個四千次吧
How about 4,000.

109
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,580
向我拼成美國國旗的每一片骨牌道歉
One for every domino I set up to make that American flag.

110
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,510
請欣賞我們的精彩剪輯
Please enjoy these highlights.

111
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,910
"澳"喲媽呀  今天是講哪國的旗呢
Crikey! What flag do we have today?

112
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,060
澳大利亞  兄弟[澳洲口音]
Australia, mate!

113
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,010
現在到了高速國旗大鑒定的單元
And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.

114
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,180
國旗  國旗
Flag. Flag.

115
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,660
不是國旗  國旗
Not a flag. Flag.

116
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,700
我太厲害了
I am crushing this.

117
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,560
貝特西·羅斯  你在縫什么呢
Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?

118
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,560
{\an8}被美國公眾廣泛認作美國國旗的首位縫制者
但缺乏足夠的檔案記載以佐證這一觀點

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
我也不知道
I have no idea.

120
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,650
因為我縫出第一面美國旗幟的故事
Because the story of me sewing the first American flag

121
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,350
是沒證據的狗屁
is unsupported poppycock.

122
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,080
那到底是誰縫的呢
Then who did sew it, hmm?

123
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,830
別問我
Don't ask me.

124
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,490
我只是個普通的女裁縫  是我的后代
I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are...

125
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,840
想出來坑蒙拐騙
out to make a quick buck!

126
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,350
賞臉共泳嗎
Fancy a dip, my dear?

127
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,930
樂意之至
I do.

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,530
等等  紫色旗子代表了
Wait, that purple flag indicates

129
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,520
水域有海洋有害生物  比如毒水母
that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,710
哇  這旗子拯"救生"命啊
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.

131
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,850
不是
No.

132
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,930
這才是"救生"圈
This is.

133
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,640
別盯著人家腿了
Stop looking at my legs.

134
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,970
不是國旗  國旗
Not a flag. Flag.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
國旗  不是國旗  
Flag. Not a flag.

136
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,090
是的
Flag.

137
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,670
靠
Crap.

138
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,640
碰到這種讓我難受的事
When stuff like this gets me down,

139
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,060
你知道我都怎么做嗎
you know what I like to do?

140
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,280
像八歲小女孩一樣唱"哈庫那馬他他"嗎
Sing "Hakuna Matata" Like an eight-year-old girl?

141
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,280
{\an8}《獅子王》電影中的歡樂歌曲
意為"不用擔心"或"沒有問題"

142
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,080
錯了  自作聰明
Wrong, smarty-pants.

143
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,250
是《樂高大電影》里的"啥事兒都好贊"
It's "Everything Is Awesome" From The Lego Movie.

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,250
{\an8}該電影中的洗腦歡樂主題曲

145
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,340
看這些筆記本
Look at these notebooks.

146
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,490
一頁一頁全都是數據
They're full of pages and pages of data.

147
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,370
明顯是他多年的心血
He clearly spent years on this.

148
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,100
只是一行行無規律的數字  扔了吧
Oh, it's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.

149
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,040
萬一這是他可能的重要突破呢
Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him?

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,540
萬一這是讓能他
What if... what if this is the thing

151
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,100
如愿以償打開那瓶香檳的東西呢
that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?

152
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,720
或許他不開  是因為不知道香檳要配什么
Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with.

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,510
草莓  魚子醬  生蠔  都是好選擇
Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices.

154
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,940
瞧你那態度
Yeah, that look right there

155
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,940
所以大家才會在參加你派對前先吃飽
is why people eat before they come to your parties.

156
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,110
這些數據絕對是有意義的
This has to mean something.

157
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,880
我沒能看出有什么規律啊
Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see,

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,530
不過輸進電腦里驗證應該是沒什么難度
but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.

159
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,880
或許我們可以用超級計算機試試
Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,700
可以啊  我們試試用不同的物理常數
Sure. We could try multiple regressions

161
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,220
與實驗常數進行多元回歸分析
with varying physical and experimental constants.

162
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,500
還可以用模式匹配算法
Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm

163
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,770
將它們與知名未解物理問題做對比
against well-known unsolved physics problems.

164
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,730
甚至有可能是替換式密碼
Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.

165
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,460
我們可以從基本密碼分析著手
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

166
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,230
或者我們可以問以前跟他同一辦公室的人
Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.

167
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,180
還是那樣做吧
Oh, let's do that.

168
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,680
因為你不知道怎么做密碼分析  對吧
Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?

169
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,200
我甚至不確定我說的詞對不對
I'm not even sure if it's the right word.

170
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,000
丹  你有個孫子
So, Dan, you have a grandson.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
-他幾歲了  -七歲
- How old is he? - Seven.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,360
我記得他  在那次野餐有見過
Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic.

173
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,740
一直哭個不停  像個娘娘腔似地
He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.

174
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,170
我聽說他是被一個小惡霸欺負了
I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.

175
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,020
有助人格發展啊
Just builds character.

176
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,930
就像我爸說的  "沒人喜歡愛哭鬼
Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby

177
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,210
除了他們自己的媽還有民主黨"
except their mommies and Democrats."

178
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,420
失陪  我去加酒
I need another drink.

179
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,100
他是有啥不滿
What's his problem?

180
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,180
不知道  可能他不喜歡聽到
I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact

181
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,060
自己的孫子被你叫娘娘腔吧
that you called his grandson a wuss.

182
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,080
可現在不是不讓叫別人"娘炮"嗎
Well, I didn't think you were supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

183
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,880
我知道你這個人很好
Okay, look, I know what a good person you are,

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,110
可有時別人會覺得你表現得有點毒舌
but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.

185
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,240
什么
What?

186
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,150
我是我這輩子認識最甜的人了
I'm, like, the sweetest person I know.

187
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,610
甜得像樹里做小餅干的童話人物  
Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.

188
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,410
可是有些時候
Yes, but once in a while,

189
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,340
有人會覺得你有點刻薄
people think you're a little mean.

190
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,490
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

191
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,430
你是那些人中的一員嗎
You one of those people?

192
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,540
不  不是不是
No. No, no, no.

193
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,520
我也覺得你是做餅干那種
I-I think the cookie thing.

194
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,580
開始
Action.

195
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,240
歡迎回來
Welcome back.

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,180
今日的來賓曾來過  并廣受觀眾喜歡
Our guest today is a returning fan favorite.

197
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,280
兒童閱讀節目《閱讀彩虹》的主持人
He puts the reading in your rainbow,

198
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,920
《星際迷航:下一代》成員
the Geordi in your La Forge,

199
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,770
電視迷你劇集《根》的主角
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

200
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,780
萊瓦爾·伯頓先生
Mr. LeVar Burton.

201
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,130
謝謝  謝爾頓  別忘了我們的約定
Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal...

202
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,010
你來上節目  我刪了你的聯系方式
You do this, I delete your contact information.

203
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
而且...
While...

204
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,680
而且是在你面前刪
While you watch me do it.

205
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
很好  很高興再來上節目
Great. Happy to be back.

206
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,900
既然你來了
Well, since you're here,

207
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,430
我想問你對某件事的看法
I'd like to get your opinion on something.

208
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,480
為了向黑人歷史月致意
In honor of Black History Month,

209
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,480
{\an8}贊頌黑人克服種種困難  以及對美國歷史的貢獻

210
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,720
我扮成了喬治·華盛頓·卡弗
I portrayed George Washington Carver

211
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
{\an8}是美國教育家  農業化學家  植物學家
對美國有十分大貢獻的一名黑人

212
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,220
我對他的致敬被我室友說"超有種族歧視"
in a loving tribute that my roommate called "wildly racist"

213
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,390
你覺得呢
What do you think?

214
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,990
你好  我的名字叫喬治
Hi. My name is George.

215
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,220
我去  不是吧
Oh, hell, no!

216
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
聽到了嗎  萊納德
You heard him, Leonard.

217
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,040
"不是"吧  我沒有種族歧視
No, it's not racist.

218
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,220
咱們確定是這里嗎
Are we sure this is the place?

219
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,240
看門的說就是這棟樓
The doorman said this is the right building.

220
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,720
看到人來就趕緊提褲子的
I think if you're pulling up your pants,

221
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,660
不會是看門的  是野戰的
you're not a doorman.

222
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,030
誰啊
Who is it?

223
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,240
我想找夏普教授
Uh, I'm looking for a Professor Sharpe?

224
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,450
等等
Hold on.

225
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,610
-有事嗎  -您好  我們是大學的人
- Can I help you? - Hi. We're from the university.

226
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,990
我們想從您這打聽艾伯特教授的信息
We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.

227
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,140
我們在清理他的辦公室時
We were cleaning out his office

228
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,360
發現了一些寫滿數字的本子
and found these books full of numbers.

229
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,710
您知道這是什么嗎
Any chance you know what it is?

230
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,610
知道  他總是在搞這玩意
Yes, he was always working on this.

231
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,720
我猜可能是某種星際坐標系
I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system,

232
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,780
或許是哈勃定律的升級版
maybe an updated version of Hubble's law.

233
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,240
{\an8}哈勃定律通常被用來推算遙遠星系的距離

234
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,240
"90"這個數字總是重復出現
I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

235
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,200
那可能是某個遙遠星系的攝動角度
That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,660
其實是一份酸奶的卡路里數
It's the number of calories in a yogurt.

237
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,480
這是他的飲食日記
That's his food diary.

238
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,520
真的假的
Really?

239
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,130
真的  他吃什么都要記下來
Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate.

240
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,420
他堅信限制卡路里攝入量
He was convinced that calorie restriction

241
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,990
是長命百歲的關鍵
was the key to living forever.

242
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,660
那管用嗎
Does it work?

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,170
你鬧呢
Seriously?

244
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,230
他可能是死于車禍啊  你又不知道
Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.

245
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,360
抱歉  真相不是那么有趣
Sorry it's not more interesting.

246
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960
往好的方面想  你們不必聽
On the bright side, you didn't have to listen

247
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,640
他35年來肚子餓得咕嚕叫的聲音
to his stomach growl for 35 years.

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,130
那艾伯特教授這輩子研究的東西
So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on

249
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,520
難道沒有半點算得上是成就的東西嗎
during his life that came close to an accomplishment?

250
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,790
老實說  他的研究一無所成
To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.

251
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,700
你是他的同事
Oh. You were his colleague.

252
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,860
你的研究結果如何
How did your research turn out?

253
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,610
很棒
Great.

254
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,160
得諾貝爾獎的人  都住這種"豪宅"
Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.

255
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,360
你可以是一個很簡樸的人啊
Well, you could be very frugal.

256
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,180
我真是受夠了每個人都在說反話了
I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

257
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,230
我不是惡霸
I'm not a bully.

258
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,080
或許我是表現得有那么一點強勢
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong,

259
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,090
但那只是因為我父親從小教育我要強硬
but that's only because my dad raised me to be tough

260
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,760
不要隨便受人欺負
and not to take crap from anybody.

261
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,350
那當然可以啊
No. That's fine,

262
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,930
但強硬跟告訴你的朋友
but there's a difference between being tough

263
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,670
她的新褲子像一塊松垮的尿布  
and telling your friend her new pants

264
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,980
這兩者還是有區別的 
look like a saggy diaper.

265
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,770
我的確那么說了  是吧
I did say that, didn't I?

266
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,640
是的  你說了
Yeah, you did.

267
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,350
我當時超級難為情  我只好把褲子退了
I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.

268
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,240
退到哪兒  嬰兒用品店嗎
Where? To Babies R Us?

269
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,160
你又來了
You're doing it again!

270
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,790
對不起  我們可以走了嗎
Okay, sorry. Can we just go?

271
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,180
我感覺大家都討厭我
I feel like everybody hates me.

272
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,720
別這樣  他們不討厭你  好嗎
Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right?

273
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,560
他們只是有點怕你而已
They're just a little intimidated.

274
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,650
你只需讓大家看到
All you need to do is show everyone

275
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,200
你其實非常親切
how sweet you really are.

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,950
-我還是走吧  -不  坐下
- I think I'd rather go. - No, come on.

277
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,250
你哪兒也不許去  知道嗎
You are not going anywhere, all right?

278
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,630
我在這陪著你  我們一起來解決這問題
I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.

279
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,360
謝謝
Thank you.

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,480
雖然你今天的裙子很難看
Even though your dress is ugly.

281
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,430
我的小旗友們
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

282
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,350
最后一集《有趣的旗幟》就要結束了
it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.

283
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,270
如果可以
If I could,

284
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,050
你們每個人都是我升上去后
I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole

285
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,940
{\an8}原俗語直翻為"升到旗桿上  看看有沒有人會敬禮"
意思是試試水  看看反應的意思

286
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,940
愿意敬禮的旗幟
and salute you.

287
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,560
如果你掉到地面  我會燒掉你
And if you touched the ground, burn you.

288
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,560
{\an8}根據規定  美國國旗降旗時  不能觸碰地面
如果國旗被弄臟或要退役  得莊重處理  通常燒毀

289
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,860
我想花一點時間
I'd like to take a moment

290
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,430
親自謝謝艾米·費拉·福勒博士
to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

291
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,390
你們或許知道  也或許不知道
who you may or may not know

292
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,560
她是第一位搭檔主持關于旗幟
is the first woman to co-host a flag

293
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,350
或橫幅相關的網絡寓教于樂節目的女性
or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.

294
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,050
聽見了嗎  玻璃天花板
Take that, glass ceiling.

295
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,050
{\an8}玻璃天花板是指女性和少數族裔無法晉升到決策層的無形障礙

296
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,810
請容許我認真地說幾句
And if I may get serious for a moment,

297
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,640
主持這檔節目
hosting this show has been...

298
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,450
是一段瘋狂的旅程
one crazy ride.

299
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,980
一路走來的高興與失落
With all its ups and downs,

300
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,820
是我無論如何都不想放棄的
I wouldn't give it up for the world.

301
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,130
除了現在  我要放棄這節目了
Except for now, when I'm giving it up.

302
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,040
在節目正式停播前  我想...
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

303
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,340
我想跟大家分享白旗的最后一個用處
I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag.

304
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,880
像這種時候  可以拿來擦眼淚
It's good for times like this.

305
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,300
晚安
Good night.

306
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,460
停
Cut.

307
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,730
謝爾頓
Sheldon...

308
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,840
剛才那段話太感人了
that was beautiful.

309
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,960
如果你沒有按下錄制...
If you didn't press record...

310
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,280
老娘按了
I pressed it!

311
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,580
結束了
Well, that's it.

312
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,370
羅杰·艾伯特的東西清理完畢
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

313
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,730
我們仍不知道是誰陷害了他
And we still don't know who framed him.

314
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,730
{\an8}兔子羅杰的電影名為《誰陷害了兔子羅杰》

315
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,870
我一直在思考  一個人的一生
I still keep thinking about how an entire life

316
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,420
怎么能一無所成呢
can seemingly amount to nothing.

317
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,410
事實就是這么悲哀
I guess the sad truth is,

318
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,570
不是所有人都能功成名就
not everyone will accomplish something great.

319
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,390
我們中有些人注定要在
Some of us may just have to find meaning

320
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,760
日常生活的點滴中尋找生命的意義
in the little moments that make up life.

321
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,570
這個看待的方法很不錯
That's a nice way of looking at it.

322
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,060
對你而言是  我可不是
Yeah for you, not for me.

323
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,340
哥上過太空呢  此生足矣
I went to space. I'm covered.

324
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,450
不如這樣
You know what?

325
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,510
這瓶香檳本來就是要慶祝成就的
This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement.

326
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,880
我們做個約定
Let's make a pact.

327
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,200
當我們中有人獲得人生中第一次重大突破時
When one of us gets their first big breakthrough,

328
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,990
我們就打開這瓶香檳慶祝
we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne

329
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,320
并向羅杰·艾伯特致敬
and toasting Professor Abbott.

330
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,050
我喜歡這主意
I love that.

331
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,690
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

332
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,130
當然還包括
Then, of course,

333
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,960
向謝爾頓炫耀我們的成果
rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.

334
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,620
-這是最精彩的部分  -沒錯
- Oh, well, that's the best part. - Oh, yeah.

335
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,360
丹  我能和你聊聊嗎
Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?

336
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,180
好的  說吧
Sure, go ahead.

337
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,640
我只是想告訴你
Just want you to know I didn't mean

338
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,140
我不是故意侮辱你的孫子
to be rude about your grandson.

339
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,720
沒關系
No, it's okay.

340
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,380
不  有關系
No, it's not.

341
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,470
佩妮告訴我  大家都怕我
Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.

342
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,150
怎么會  怎么會
What? What?

343
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,500
她為什么那么說
Why would she say that?

344
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,710
-你知道她是酒鬼  會亂說話吧  -少來
- You know she drinks, right? - What?

345
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,210
不  她說得對  我要讓你知道
No, she's right, and I just want you to know

346
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,370
從現在起  我會多體會大家心情
that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive.

347
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,830
我不想讓大家在我面前如履薄冰
I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.

348
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,970
那好吧  有件事
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

349
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,070
我一直想告訴你
one thing I've been meaning to tell you

350
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,040
公司不再給我們提供免費的咖啡了
is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.

351
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,910
沒問題  什么時候開始
No problem. When does that start?

352
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,500
五個月前
Five months ago.

353
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,350
-什么  -沒錯
- What?! - Yeah.

354
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,980
那我的咖啡一直都是誰買的
Who's been paying for my coffee?

355
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,030
我們大伙兒
All of us.

356
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,570
買咖啡的錢來自你一罵人
Yeah. It comes from the swear jar

357
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,930
我們就投錢進去的那個臟話罐
we put money in when you curse.

358
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,560
還有什么事是我不知道的
What else don't I know about?

359
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,030
-你的私人衛生間  -怎么了
- Uh, well, you know your private bathroom? - Yeah?

360
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,300
那應該是給整層樓的人使用的
That was supposed to be for the whole floor.

361
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,420
-你開什么玩笑  -那個無所謂
- You're kidding. - No, no. It's okay.

362
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,540
其實只對輪椅妹凱西有影響
It only really affected wheelchair Kathy,

363
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,980
現在她已經回醫院了
and she's back in the hospital now,

364
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,580
所以沒什么問題了
so it all worked out.

365
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,700
我感覺好難過哦
I feel so bad.

366
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,830
那你就不應該給人家取名"輪椅妹凱西"啊
Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have named her "Wheelchair Kathy."

367
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,140
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

368
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,380
我以為大家都喜歡我  其實我只是個怪獸
I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.

369
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,330
但很可愛呀  就像《怪獸公司》里的獨眼怪
But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.

370
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,000
不  我最壞了
No, I'm the worst.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,830
我是個壞人
I'm a terrible person.

372
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,300
乖  別哭  沒關系啦
Come on, don't cry. It's okay.

373
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,530
有關系
It's not okay.

374
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,200
我哪還有臉留在這工作呀
How can I even work here anymore? Oh.

375
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,840
-這家公司需要你  -真沒事
- Because this company needs you. - It's fine.

376
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,570
我們不介意給你買咖啡
We don't mind paying for the coffee.

377
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,970
我不能讓你們這么做
I can't let you do that.

378
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,610
或許我們可以給你
Maybe we could get you

379
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,090
買一臺咖啡機放在你辦公室里
an espresso machine for your office.

380
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,810
-這樣也行吧  -好的
- I guess that would be all right. - All right.

381
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,040
瞧  你不刻薄也能得到你想要的東西
See? You don't have to be mean to get what you want.

382
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,730
此話有理
You're right.

383
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,160
那我的私人衛生間現在怎么處理呢
Now where did we land on my bathroom?

384
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,810
好啊
Hi.

385
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,940
回來啦
Hello.

386
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,630
這么晚還不睡嗎
How come you're up so late?

387
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,030
我上傳《有趣的旗幟》最終集好幾個小時了
I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago,

388
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,560
沒有任何人在乎到愿意留個言
and not a single person cared enough to comment.

389
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,970
一切努力都是徒然
All that effort for nothing.

390
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,550
我明白你的感受
I know how you feel.

391
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,780
我今天一天把一個男人一生事業扔進垃圾桶
I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career,

392
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,720
唯一留下的是一瓶陳年香檳
and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne

393
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,080
和拉杰自以為沒人發現
and a naked lady pen that Raj took

394
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,110
就私吞了的一根裸女筆
when he thought no one was looking.

395
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,040
這根本是兩碼事
It's not the same thing.

396
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,460
你完全不明白我的感受
I don't think you know how I feel at all.

397
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,490
是難過嗎
Sad?

398
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,320
看來你真的懂我
You do get me.

399
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,760
有人留言了
Someone left a comment.

400
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,040
他們說什么
Yeah. What did they say?

401
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,000
"你的節目結束了真可惜
"Too bad your show is done.

402
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,610
我還挺喜歡的"
I kind of liked it."

403
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,560
萊納德  你聽到了嗎
Leonard, did you hear that?

404
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,290
網友們難過得要死
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

405
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,140
這世界上不能沒有這節目
I can't take this away from the world!

406
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,970
《有趣的旗幟》滿血復活了
Fun with Flags is back!

407
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,430
恭喜
Congratulations.

408
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,160
我們來慶祝吧
Let's celebrate!

409
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,460
謝爾頓  那不是給你的
Sheldon, that wasn't for you!

410
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,970
我也沒打算喝啊
Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it.

411
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,310
我只想聽開瓶那砰的一聲
I just wanted to hear the pop.

412
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,020
我知道會砰的一聲  還是嚇死人家了 
Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.

413
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,370
萊瓦爾·伯頓
LeVar Burton?

414
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,100
萊瓦爾·伯頓
LeVar Burton!

415
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,040
萊瓦爾·伯頓
LeVar Burton!

416
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,960
你來干嘛
What are you doing here?

417
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,770
你不讓我打電話給你
You told me not to call,

418
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,950
我不知道該怎么告訴你這個好消息
and I didn't know how else to give you the good news.

419
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,520
《有趣的旗幟》回歸了
Fun with Flags is back,

420
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
下一集你可以來當嘉賓
and you can be in the next episode.

421
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,840
威爾·惠頓讓我弄個大閘門
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

422
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,730
-我當初真該聽他的話  -你真是...
- I don't know why I didn't get a gate. - You...

423
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,000
至少你聽我說完前提
At least listen to the premise.

424
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,970
既然你在德國出生
Since you were born in Germany,

425
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,750
我們可以聊聊德國國旗
I thought we could talk about German flags.

426
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,250
你有興趣裝扮成卐字圖案嗎
How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?

427
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,250
{\an8}德國納粹旗  該卐與佛教的卍相反
