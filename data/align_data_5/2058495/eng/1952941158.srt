1
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,745
"The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss covered door.

2
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:08,213
"You manage to open it
only to find yourself

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:11,016
"face-to-face with a hideous,
foul-smelling,

4
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,701
moss-covered ogre."

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,836
What do you do?

6
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:17,739
I say, "Hey, Ma,
what's for dinner?"

7
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,627
Seventeen.

8
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:26,631
The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

9
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:30,469
By the by, I liked it, too.

10
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:33,755
How go the wedding plans,
Howard?

11
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:35,724
Great.
We spent five hours last night

12
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:37,476
at Macy's registering for gifts.

13
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:38,927
Looks like I'm finally going
to have

14
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,762
that darling little earthenware
asparagus dish

15
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:41,930
I've always wanted.

16
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:43,431
See, this is the good thing

17
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:46,067
about having a girlfriend
9,000 miles away.

18
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,770
I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

19
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:50,672
You mean like playing nerd games
with us

20
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:54,108
and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

21
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,997
Maybe.

22
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,617
We enter the dungeon.

23
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,419
You see a dragon.

24
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,922
Really? So we're playing
Dungeons & Dragons

25
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:09,641
and we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,144
Isn't that a little
on the nose?

27
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,680
When you play Chutes and
Ladders, do you complain

28
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:18,016
about all the chutes
and all the ladders?

29
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:22,320
Are you gonna eat
that whole pie?

30
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,606
Maybe. Why not?

31
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,642
Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

32
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,029
Oh, God, did you watch
Bridget Jones again?

33
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:34,699
No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

34
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:37,335
Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married,

35
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:38,820
you're dating my sister.

36
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:40,455
Now that Howard's
getting married,

37
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:43,157
maybe he'll inflate one of
his old girlfriends for you.

38
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:46,211
You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

39
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:47,495
The United States of America.

40
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,515
Your movies and your TV shows
promised streets paved

41
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,969
with beautiful blonde women
with big bazongas.

42
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,556
Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.

43
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,674
That's cruel.

44
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,393
You know it goes
straight to my hips.

45
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:03,945
Gentlemen, please focus.

46
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,448
You're facing
a fire-breathing dragon.

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,116
I don't know if I want
to play anymore.

48
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,902
Because you don't have
a girlfriend?

49
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,537
Well, good Lord,
if that becomes a reason not

50
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,574
to play Dungeons & Dragons, this
game's in serious trouble.

61
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,800
Now, I assume we use
this same wax later on

62
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,101
to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.

63
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:51,271
Yeah, my bikini region
is fine.

64
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,623
Who's shocked? I'm not.

65
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,393
(giggles)

66
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,761
So, Bernadette, how's the
wedding planning going?

67
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,114
And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.

68
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,650
Pick me! Pick me!

69
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,455
We went cake-tasting yesterday.

70
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:09,772
Raj came along.

71
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:13,109
He cried and ate half
the samples.

72
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,245
Oh, the poor guy's so lonely.

73
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:17,080
We should set him up
with someone.

74
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,616
You know, I met
a really cute girl at work.

75
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,553
She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.

76
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,272
Well, hello?

77
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,690
She's married.

78
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,476
Yeah, but her husband is in

79
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,461
serious congestive
heart failure,

80
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:36,649
and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.

81
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,770
Okay, so future
grief-stricken widow

82
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:42,322
is the one to beat.

83
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,526
Are we ready to order?

84
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,494
One moment.

85
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,362
I'm conducting
an experiment.

86
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:53,333
With Dungeons
& Dragons dice?

87
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,120
Yes. From here on in,
I've decided

88
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,989
to make all trivial decisions
with a throw of the dice,

89
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,341
thus freeing up my mind

90
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:04,928
do what it does best--
enlighten and amaze.

91
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:10,517
Page 14,
item seven.

92
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,051
So, what's for dinner?

93
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,221
A side of corn
succotash.

94
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,440
Hmm. Interesting.

95
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,676
Um, Howard, can I see you
for a minute, please?

96
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,979
I don't want to show any more
of your friends

97
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:26,316
how I can fit
in the booster seats.

98
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:29,352
Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please.

99
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,357
Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.

100
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,045
A pitcher of margaritas.

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,916
Do you really want that?

102
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:44,384
That's the great thing.

103
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:45,718
It doesn't matter.

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,305
My mind is freed up to think
about more important things.

105
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:51,174
What's it thinking
about now?

106
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:53,593
Hamburgers and lemonade.

107
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,231
Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

108
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,767
This is my friend Emily.
I know her from my spin class.

109
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,639
Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.

110
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:11,894
Emily, this is
our friend Raj.

111
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,697
Oh!

112
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,733
Look at you guys
just hitting it off.

113
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,402
I am so good.

114
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,759
Hi.

115
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,580
She says, "It's
nice to meet you""

116
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:31,798
Does she really mean that

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,516
or was she signing it
sarcastically?

118
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:39,188
Raj says it's nice
to meet you, too.

119
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,608
She says she has to go
back to her family,

120
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,810
but Penny has her
number if you want

121
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,695
to text her and
get together.

122
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,930
Okay, I'm going to play it cool.

123
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:52,368
Tell her,
"Maybe. Whatever, babe."

124
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,289
He'll text you.

125
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,544
Look at that. I have a date.

126
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,112
I love America again.

127
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,468
And now for dessert...

128
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,454
Come on, hot fudge sundae,
come on, hot fudge sundae.

129
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,473
Bam!
That's what I'm talking about!

130
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,811
Okay, as soon
as she gets here,

131
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,513
so she knows
I'm cool with it,

132
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:22,815
I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.

133
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,439
I was thinking, "Hey,
did you hear the one about...?

134
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,307
Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

135
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:37,580
Maybe we should revisit
your lonely fat guy plan.

136
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,582
Oh, she's here.

137
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,785
No joke.

138
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,641
She says she's sorry
she's late.

139
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,093
Tell her
it doesn't matter.

140
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:53,179
Tell her, her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies

141
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:57,433
in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

142
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,103
Really?

143
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,055
That's the first thing
you want to say?

144
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,806
I worked on it all night.
Use it.

145
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,892
Look, I don't know the
sign for opalescent.

146
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:07,026
Then spell it.

147
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,394
I don't know how to spell it.

148
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,179
You're blowing this for me!

149
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,900
He likes your eyes.

150
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,352
You're making me sound
like a caveman.

151
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,572
She says, "Thank you.
You have nice eyes, too."

152
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:22,241
Really? Ask her how many
children she wants,

153
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:25,545
and whatever number she says,
say, "Me, too."

154
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,882
No.

155
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,885
Fine. Tell her I have a deep,
sexy voice

156
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,837
like James Earl Jones.

157
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,675
She doesn't know what James
Earl Jones sounds like.

158
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:41,978
Great.
Then she won't know I'm lying.

159
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,150
Let's see, what else
can I tell you about me

160
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:51,487
that would make you
like me?

161
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:52,939
Ooh, I love music.

162
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,908
Do you love music?

163
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,196
You really want
to ask her that?

164
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,999
You're right.
Everyone loves music.

165
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,587
She says, "Do you play
an instrument?"

166
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,238
No,

167
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,590
but when I was
six years old,

168
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,625
I tried to start
a boy band called

169
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,378
Frankie Goes
to Bollywood.

170
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,750
But I couldn't get
any other boys to join,

171
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,719
so my parents asked
the servants

172
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,188
to be my backup dancers.

173
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,589
Wait, when you sign
"servants,"

174
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,774
don't sign it
like I'm bragging.

175
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,642
Sign it in a way
that I sound humble

176
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:34,697
with just a hint of
"That's right, I had servants."

177
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,617
Do you hear yourself

178
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:41,370
Yes, but she doesn't.
So get signing, hand monkey.

179
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,778
I think I wrote a letter
to Santa Claus every day.

180
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,297
And then on Christmas morning,

181
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,216
under the tree is
a little puppy

182
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,468
with a red ribbon.

183
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,586
(chuckles)

184
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,837
What are you doing?

185
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,006
Texting Bernadette that
I'm gonna be late.

186
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,808
Dude, what is she saying?

187
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,677
It's a funny story
about a puppy.

188
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,295
Just smile and laugh.

189
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,980
(chuckles)

190
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,899
- Quick, quick, stop smiling.
- What? Why?

191
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:13,102
The puppy died-- it
choked on a doll head.

192
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,687
Sad face, sad face!

193
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,025
It's a little hard
to see with the city lights,

194
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,645
but that W-shaped constellation
is Cassiopeia.

195
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,815
And she was the mother
of Andromeda who's over there.

196
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,036
Look, pretty stars.

197
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,159
This is her car.

198
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,711
She hopes she can see you again
sometime.

199
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,462
Good, good.

200
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,097
Oh, boy,

201
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,048
help me out here.

202
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,833
Does she want me
to kiss her or not?

203
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,502
I speak sign language,
I don't read minds.

204
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,721
If you were me,
would you kiss her?

205
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,173
Yeah, but I'm a make out king.

206
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:04,353
I was so smooth
on that date.

207
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,872
You? I made
you smooth.

208
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,240
You were an idiot.

209
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,708
Whatever, dude.
She kissed me.

210
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,293
It might've been
on your lips,

211
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,578
but it was my kiss.

212
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,047
Oh, fine. Let's agree
she kissed both of us.

213
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,367
Okay.

214
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,964
Mustache is looking good
there, Sheldon.

215
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,574
Don't thank me.
Thank the dice.

216
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:35,027
They told me what percentage
of my face to shave.

217
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,829
Why are you still doing this?

218
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,280
Because it's working.

219
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,915
In the past few weeks,

220
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,784
unburdened by
trivial decisions,

221
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,619
I've co-authored
two papers

222
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,703
in notable peer-reviewed
journals,

223
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,423
and I'm close to
figuring out why

224
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:48,841
the Large Hadron
Collider has yet

225
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:51,126
to isolate the Higgs
boson particle.

226
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:53,495
You left out,
got chafed testicles

227
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:56,098
because you no longer
wear underpants.

228
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:02,004
The dice giveth
and the dice taketh away.

229
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,608
Is Raj out
with Emily again?

230
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,610
Yeah, every night
for the last month.

231
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,695
Wow, can't believe
he has a girlfriend.

232
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,065
Me neither.

233
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:17,352
Here's some other fun news
on the Raj/Emily front.

234
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:20,789
He gave her a pair of diamond
earrings and leased her a car.

235
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,207
You're kidding.

236
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,159
You think she's taking
advantage of him?

237
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,377
Oh, of course not.

238
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,079
She wouldn't do
something like that.

239
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,797
She's deaf.

240
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,752
Deaf women can't be
gold diggers?

241
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,838
Handicapped people
are nice, Leonard.

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,140
Everyone knows that.

243
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,177
Yeah, I actually
have information about Raj

244
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,263
that would be helpful
with this discussion.

245
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:50,986
Could you tell us?

246
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:53,188
Let's see.

247
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,242
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

248
00:11:58,445 --> 00:11:59,778
Wait, hang on.

249
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,163
Doubles.
Roll again.

250
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,784
Okay, get this.

251
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,005
It doesn't matter if
he's showering her with gifts,

252
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:13,241
because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

253
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,461
What do you mean
"vastly wealthy"?

254
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,763
Well, "wealthy" means
a lot of money.

255
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:18,964
"Vastly" means even more.

256
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,300
I'm not sure
what's tripping you up.

257
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,470
Look, I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.

258
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:25,754
No, you're wrong.

259
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:28,423
As you know, a few years ago,
I achieved one of

260
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:31,060
my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.

261
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,528
Well, from
time to time,

262
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,065
I notarize
banking documents for Raj.

263
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:40,769
The Koothrappalis aren't just
rich, they're Richie Rich rich.

264
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,906
Well, so how much is that?

265
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:47,660
About halfway between
Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.

266
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,511
What the hell?

267
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:51,130
The last time
we went to the zoo,

268
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,799
that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.

269
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:56,335
Listen, guys, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude,

270
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:59,922
but I need to go call Raj's
sister, who I love so much.

271
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:04,309
So vastly much.

272
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:11,150
Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts and a car.

273
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:13,235
And she got him to pay off
all her credit cards.

274
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:16,138
What? He paid off
her credit cards?

275
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,074
Damn it, I could've dated Raj
for a couple months.

276
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,911
But I-I wouldn't have, because
I'm not that kind of girl.

277
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,747
We should really talk to Raj.

278
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,583
He's not going to listen,
he's in love.

279
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:29,284
Can't figure out what to do?

280
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,503
I remember those days.

281
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:34,840
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to...

282
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,925
stay right here.

283
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah, this is a bad idea.

284
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:42,881
- We should go.
- No.

285
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,516
I'm the one that
introduced him to her.

286
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,051
I've got to
say something.

287
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,522
Wow.

288
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,342
You're engaged
to my friend.

289
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,678
Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind
where I get my motor running,

290
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,848
as long as I park
in the right garage.

291
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,686
I can't believe
you're engaged to my friend.

292
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,273
(whispers):
Oh, here she comes.

293
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:10,676
Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick
can't hear you.

294
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:16,448
Hi.

295
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,133
Oh, hey, hi.

296
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:19,218
Nice to see you.

297
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,554
Um, can we talk
to you about Raj?

298
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,224
She says, "Sure,
what about him""

299
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:27,810
Okay, um, gosh,
how do I start?

300
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:31,546
Um, see, Raj is
kind of naive.

301
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,982
I mean, he hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.

302
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:37,853
And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to,

303
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,404
you might be
taking advantage of him.

304
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,057
You know, by letting him buy you
a bunch of expensive things.

305
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,158
And I-I...

306
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,910
Howard, focus.

307
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:46,278
Tell her what I'm saying.

308
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,279
Right.

309
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:49,081
Are you a gold digger or not?

310
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,951
Oh, uh, something,
something,

311
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,853
who the something do
you think you are?

312
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,421
Mind your own
something business

313
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:59,124
and go something
yourself.

314
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:00,793
(chuckles):
Oh.

315
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:03,178
Wait, I got
this now.

316
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:07,415
I'm so mad at you!

317
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,550
Okay, wait...

318
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,519
How dare you ambush my
girlfriend at the gym!

319
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:12,187
We didn't mean
for it to be an ambush.

320
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:16,024
Just, it's kind of impossible
not to sneak up on deaf people.

321
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:19,695
And hey, since when
are you so chatty?

322
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:20,929
I'm hammered.

323
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:22,397
Raj, come here.

324
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,317
This girl is trouble.

325
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,035
I mean, what kind of
relationship is it

326
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:29,571
where you buy her gifts
and she gives you sex?

327
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:32,374
The best one I ever had!

328
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,710
Okay, come on.

329
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,245
You know you
can do better.

330
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,780
Aha.

331
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,415
I see what's going on here.

332
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,502
You and I had
our crazy night together,

333
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:46,255
and now you can't stand
to see me with another woman.

334
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,140
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's okay.

335
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:49,875
I can't get mad
at your feelings.

336
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,143
I don't have feelings.

337
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,127
Yeah, that's good.

338
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,229
Keep telling
yourself that.

339
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:58,066
He is cuter
now that I know he's rich.

340
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:04,639
I have a surprise
for you.

341
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,908
Cover your eyes.

342
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:10,195
Open them.

343
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,790
It's a real ruby.

344
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,593
It was a little
expensive,

345
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:28,463
but no one can put
a price on love.

346
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:31,934
Although, the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.

347
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:35,971
(Skype ringtone playing)

348
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:39,858
Oh, Mummy, Daddy.

349
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,226
What a nice surprise.

350
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:44,913
No, it's not a nice surprise,
it's a bad surprise.

351
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,015
Penny called us.

352
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:48,116
Penny?

353
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:49,501
She told us
you're spending all our money

354
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:50,669
on your new girlfriend.

355
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:54,039
I just got her a
couple of things.

356
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,224
She gives me things, too.

357
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:57,409
Yeah, yeah, I'm
a gynecologist.

358
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,112
I know exactly
what she gives you.

359
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:04,549
You need to find a nice
Indian girl from a good family.

360
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,868
If you keep seeing this woman,
you're cut off.

361
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,855
What? You're going to make me
choose between the woman I love

362
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:13,926
and the money I... have
very strong feelings for?

363
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:15,894
It's up to you.

364
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,831
Well, I choose love.

365
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,516
(scoffs)
You're an idiot.

366
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:25,854
Love doesn't last.

367
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:35,497
Well, he's going to
find out eventually.

368
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:36,999
Think about it.

369
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:46,925
My parents are making me
choose between money and you.

370
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,294
I choose you.

371
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,549
No, I think we'll have
to return the car.

372
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,936
And that necklace,
yeah, that, too.

373
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,105
But none of those
things matter,

374
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:02,808
because we have
something better.

375
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,926
We have love.

376
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh, Penny, I
hurt so bad.

377
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:19,741
I know, I know.

378
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,743
Sometimes I put
the TV on mute

379
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,962
just to pretend
she's still with me.

380
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:33,805
But I can't watch the closed
captioning without crying.

381
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,293
Oh, I'm so sorry.

382
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,295
I wish I could
make you feel better.

383
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,014
Seriously?

384
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,149
I'm heartbroken and
you're hitting on me?

385
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,851
What?! No!

386
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:48,353
Look, Penny,
you're great,

387
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:50,572
but I had a long talk
with my parents,

388
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:54,359
and they said if I date an
Indian girl, I get a Maserati.

389
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:01,684
Mmm.

390
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:02,885
Oh, cheesecake,

391
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,419
you're just as good as a woman,

392
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:06,355
even though I can't
have sex with you.

393
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:10,359
Try throwing it in the microwave
for a few seconds.

394
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:18,567
Should I use the rest room
or wait until we get home?

395
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:21,286
Come on, papa needs
to void his bladder.

396
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:24,373
Oh, that's not what you want
to see after three buttermilks.

397
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:26,959
Here you go, boys.

398
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,777
I'll pick it up
when you're ready.

399
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,128
Thanks for dinner,
buddy.

400
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,914
Yeah, real big of you.

401
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,899
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

402
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:35,992
Oh, and don't cheap
out on the tip.

403
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,410
We all know
you're loaded now.

404
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:41,412
