00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,010
Gentlemen,I put it to you:
先生们 我告诉你们哟

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,040
the worst tapioca pudding is better than
the best pudding of any other flavor.
最难吃西米布丁也好过其他口味优质布丁

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,510
First off,that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.
首先 明眼人都知道这话错的
因为最好的布丁是巧克力口味

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,570
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.
其次 西米的有机结构使布丁
黏糊糊摇晃晃 有潜在致命危险

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,940
It is extracted from the plant...
是从植物里提取...

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,140
Hey,I'm thinking of growing a mustache.
嘿 我在考虑留点胡子

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,360
No kidding?
不是吧?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,370
Fu Manchu, a handlebar,pencil?
傅满洲那样的? 八字胡 又尖又长?

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,810
- It's extracted from the plant.
- I'm not sure yet.
- 是从植物中提取
- 还没想好呢

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,350
You know,George Clooney has one now.
乔治・克鲁尼现在也留胡子呢

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,140
Really? I once saw him shopping
at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.
真的? 我看到过他在Ralphs超市买龙舌兰酒

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,280
You'd think a guy like that would
have some kind of booze lackey.
你以为他们会有仆人跑腿买酒吗?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,790
All right, this is cruel.
好啦 太残忍了

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,580
We'd better let him finish
before his head explodes.
我们还是让他说完
不然人家要爆头了

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,700
All right,Sheldon, why is tap...
好吧 Sheldon 为啥西...

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,240
Tapioca is extracted from the root
of the plant manihot esculenta!
西米由食用木薯根茎提取而成

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,790
Due to a high concentration of cyanide,
由于富含高浓度的氰化物

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,390
it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly!
其本身有毒性 如加工不当即食用会致命

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,030
Feel better now?
现在爽了吧?

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,460
It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the coa
bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding.
同时可可豆也是巴西的
从中能提取巧克力 做最好的布丁

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,360
And you promised you
wouldn't do that anymore!
求你们别再耍我了!

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,510
Hey,Hofstadter.
嘿 Hofstadter

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,280
Hey,Kripke.
嘿 Kripke

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,930
Heard about your latest
anti-proton decay experiment.
听说你最新的反质子衰变实验了

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,270
20,000 data runs and no
statistically significant results.
收集两万数据 却没啥有用的结果

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,870
Very impressive.
灰常了得

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,760
What a jerk.
蠢货一个

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,270
Don't feel bad,Leonard. Negative
results are still results.
别气馁 Leonard 没用的结果也是结果

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
- Even 20,000 of them.
- All right!
- 就算两万又算啥
- 行啦!

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,170
Please don't cheer me up anymore.
求你们别在给我打气了

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,490
Come on. Don't let him
get to you. It's Kripke.
别呀 不要让他打击到你
Kripke哪根葱

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah,he's a ginormous knob.
对呀 大蠢蛋一个

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,820
That's why he eats by himself instead
of sitting here at the cool table.
所以他孤单用餐
而不能坐到这酷酷的桌子来

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,770
For shizzle.
说得对呀

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,070
It's true Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.
确实啊 Kripke确实缺乏
咱固有的那种基本社交技巧

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,280
But he also controls the new
open science grid computer
但他还操控着新的开放科学网格计算机

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,370
that I need to use to run some simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.
而我需要它来模拟宇宙早期的结构形态

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,920
Well,good luck getting time on it.
看你有没有那命用上吧

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,360
The only people he lets
use it are his friends.
他可只让他的朋友使用

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,630
Well,then, the solution is simple.
那 解决办法很简单嘛

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,470
I shall befriend him.
我去和他做朋友

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,930
Kripke!
Kripke!

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,610
Yeah?
啥事?

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,010
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?
你觉得我们交个朋友如何?

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
I would say I have no interest
in becoming your friend.
我觉得木有啥兴趣哟

46
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,340
Really?
当真?

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,560
That seems rather shortsighted coming from someone
who is generally considered altogether unlikable.
你个里里外外不受欢迎的家伙
目光还真是相当短浅呀

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,210
Why don't you take
some time to reconsider?
不如重新考虑下吧?

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,540
Yeah,I'll do that.
行呀 我去想想

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,250
Well,I think we're off
to a terrific start.
看来咱这开局不错啊

go right into your spam folder.
现在所有Wolowitz发来的邮件
都会直接进入垃圾箱

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,960
Thanks. I mean, the e-mail doesn't bother me as much
as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
多谢 其实骚扰邮件倒没啥
他穿浴衣的度假照比较雷人

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah,I got the same one, and that's
not a bathing suit. It's a tan line.

那可不是浴衣 是晒痕

you today in the cafeteria.

I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.
我注意到你买了推荐沙拉

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,810
Apparently,you did not know that the chef's
salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat.
显然 你不知道推荐沙拉是
食堂的杂碎肉骗人把戏

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,190
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.
不过呢 我希望你用餐愉快

Oh,really? Well,good for him.

Geppetto, I don't think it's gonna happen.
除非他像杰佩托做出皮诺曹
不然没戏的

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,300
How did you guys become friends?

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,370
There was a flyer on the
bulletin board at the university:

"Roommate wanted.Whistlers

I assumed he was joking.
我以为他说着玩的

You'd be surprised how many particle
physicists have a whimsical side.
你绝对想不到有多少量子物理学家

did he become friends with them?
Howard和Raj呢?
我是说他咋和他们好上的?

77
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,530
I don't know. How do carbon
atoms form a benzene ring?
不知道 碳原子是如何构成苯环的?

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,400
Proximity and valence electrons.

Well,sure, when you put it that way.

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,840
But it all worked out,right?
但相处的也不错是吧

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,280
I suppose. I do miss whistling, though.

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,730

What is this?
这是啥?

88
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,850
It's a questionnaire I devised.

I'm having some difficulty
bonding with a colleague at work
我和一位同事交友遇到点困难

understand why my current friends like me.
所以我想做些小调查 更好的了解
为什么我目前的朋友们喜欢我

Yes,well,that is a good question.
嗯 这个问题值得考虑

92
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,460
But is this really the
best way to figure it out?
但你确定这是最好的办法了?

93
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,820
I agree. The social
sciences are largely hokum.
问得好 社会学家很大程度是忽悠

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,360
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response to my companionship,
但又不能插一个电极到你的大脑
探测你对我友谊问题的反应

95
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,130
this is the best I can do.
就这方法还凑合了

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,740
Okay,"Question one: "Rank the
following aspects of Sheldon Cooper

00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,200
I know,I may have started
out with a fairly obvious one;

99
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,890
an aspect of my most
appealing trait: playfulness.
谁不知道我最吸引人的特质之一 有趣

Why don't you just go ahead
and rank that number one?

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm afraid you're on
your own for the rest.

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,830
It should take you no
more than three hours.

You got it... buddy.
客气啥...姐们儿

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,510
Sheldon,honey,did you ever consider making
friends by being,I don't know, pleasant?
Sheldon 亲爱的 你有没有考虑过
通过让人开心来交友啊?

109
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,940
Well,that's certainly a
thought-provoking hypothesis.
那当然是一个发人深思的假设

110
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,740
May I suggest it as the
topic for your essay?
我看你论文写这题目好了

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,300
Your questionnaire, very disappointing.
你的调查问卷 十分让人失望呀

I answered every question, Sheldon.
我逢题必答呀 Sheldon

113

You answered the multiple
choice questions in a pattern:

A- B-A-C.A-
B-A-C.

How could I not?

Come on. There's over 200 questions.
行行好 超过200个问题

118
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,550
And look at some of these things.

the space shuttle is to blank?"

making friends if I wait till the Cylons take over?
你在论文里还说等到赛昂人接管地球
我在交友方面会更有运气

124
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,770
Please.
请别

125
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,820
Now hold on. I put some
real work into that.
等等 那篇我可是认真写的

126
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,420
Yes,well,it's better
than what Wolowitz did.
是呀 可比Wolowitz好多了

127
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,930
He drew a raccoon with what
appears to be a distended scrotum.

Until you get to the scrotum.

What hope do I have for establishing
new relationships given that

my current friends apparently could not take
a few hours out of their lives to help me?
现存的朋友们都舍不得用
他们漫长生命的少许小时来帮助我

Sheldon,I'm not going to
defend a big-balled raccoon.

Well,I don't see how you could.
我看不出你能做到

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,810
What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't
approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
我想说的是 或许你不能把
这些当作纯粹智力习题来对待

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,540
What do you mean?
你什么意思?

136

Well,remember when you tried to
learn how to swim using the Internet?

It occurred to me that you
hadn't returned any of my calls
我想到哈 你没回我的电话

215
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,140
because I hadn't offered any concrete
suggestions for pursuing our friendship.
是因为我没为发展友情提出实际建议

216
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,540
Perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.

217
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,910

have time for a hot beverage?

Gee,why can't Sheldon make friends?
天呀 Sheldon咋交不到朋友呢?

All right,Kripke, that last interest
strikes me as the least objectionable,
好了 Kripke 你刚说那兴趣爱好

You know,I am a fan of ventriloquism.

245
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,300
Maybe you,me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

246
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,610

monolithic than it did on my laptop.

One expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

You afraid of heights, Cooper?
你恐高啊 Cooper?

251
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,160
Hardly. A fear of heights is illogical.
哪能啊 恐高完全不合理

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,050
A fear of falling, on the other
hand, is prudent and evolutionary.
然而害怕掉下来 才是有发展眼光的说法

253
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,750
What would you say is the minimum altitude I
need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?
你说要巩固我们的友情

here. Little kids climb this.

So is this your entire job?
Your parents must be so proud.

- I'm coming,Kripke.
- 来啊 Cooper
- 来了 Kripke

258
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay,the harness seems to be secure.
好的 绳子貌似很结实

259
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,070
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the Web site said that's to be expected.
刚才有点不能自制
但网上说那是正常情况

260
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,130
this isn't so bad. It's
like vertical swimming.
也不咋难嘛 像是垂直游泳

261
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,490
Hey,look at you,Cooper. You're
almost halfway to the top.
嘿 瞧瞧 Cooper 都爬到一半了

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,820
I am?
是吗?

263
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,220
I was wrong. It is a fear of heights.
我错了 我恐高

264
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,460
You all right there,Cooper?
你还好吗 Cooper?

265
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,710
Not really.
不太好

266
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,650
I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent
function that's approached an asymptote.
感觉像是反正切曲线接近渐近线了

267
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,020
Are you saying you're stuck?
你是说你卡住了?

268
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,030
What part of inverse tangent function
approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
反正切曲线接近渐近线
哪个字你不明白啊?

269
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,950
I understood all of it. I'm
not a moron. Just keep going.
我都明白 我又不是白痴 接着爬啦

270
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,860
Yeah,I don't think I can.
我想我做不到

271
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,430
Well,then climb back down.
那就爬下去

272
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,730
No,that doesn't seem any more likely.
不行 更没可能了

273
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,630
What's your plan,Cooper?
你打算咋办 Cooper?

274
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,520
Well,it's not exactly a plan,
but I think I'm going to pass out.
不能算是啥打算 我想我要晕菜了

275
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,470
I'm sorry,can we please
just do it one more time?
抱歉 咱再做一次行吗?

276
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,630
Okay. One,two, one,two,three,and...
好的 一二 一二三

277
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,290
