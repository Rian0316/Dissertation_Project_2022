262
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,450
增加貨物量會威脅

263
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,720
整條產業鏈的可靠度

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,170
我可否問下  埃拉迪奧允許此事嗎

我想對你們道歉

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,720
盡管當時情況危急
Despite the difficult circumstances,

但你們仍表現出色
you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.

282
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,960
因此  如果有任何人受到了精神創傷
That said, if any of you wish to seek counseling

283
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
想要尋求心理咨詢

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,350
因為我確信  你們回到家之后
as I am sure, in one way or another,

287
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,290
或多或少還受到這次事件的影響
each of you brought this incident home with you.

288
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,180
你說  萊爾
Uh, yes, Lyle?

289
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,000
弗林先生  那些人是誰
Mr. Fring, uh... who were those guys?

290
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,120
你們其中的一些人知道  很多年前
Well, some of you know, that many years ago,

291
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,590
我在米卻肯州開了第一家洛博羅炸雞店
I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos in Michoacán.

292
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,320
開店后不久
Shortly thereafter,

293
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,980
那些人就出現了
those same men showed up.

294
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
他們想要錢
They wanted money.

295
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,890
而我...
And I-I am --

296
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,590
我很慚愧  我給了他們
I'm ashamed to say that I paid them.

297
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,620
在那種地方  在那個年代
You see, in that place, at that time,

298
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,590
如果想繼續做生意  我就別無選擇
if I wished to conduct my business...I had no choice.

299
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,860
但是昨天...
but yesterday...

300
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,040
昨天  他們來到了這里
yesterday, they came here.

301
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,730
這里
Here.

302
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,390
他們嚇到了我的客人
They intimidated my customers.

303
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,070
威脅了我的員工
They threatened my employees.

304
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,100
再一次地
And, again,

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,100
他們又來要錢了
they wanted money.

306
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,330
我的朋友們  我必須承認
Now, my friends, I-I must confess

307
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,490
我差點就給了他們
that I almost gave them what they wanted.

308
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,820
但是突然  我想  "不
But then, I thought, "No.

309
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,170
不
No.

310
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,460
這里是美國"
This is America."

311
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,750
在這里  正直的人沒有理由害怕
Here, the righteous have no reason to fear.

312
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,600
在這里  那些人沒有力量
Here, those men have no power.

313
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,610
當他們發現我并不怕他們時
And when they saw that I had no fear of them,

314
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,010
他們就像懦夫一樣溜走了
they ran like the cowards they are.

315
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,620
穿過邊境回去了
Back across the border.

316
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,140
再也不會回來
They will not return.

317
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,060
我們會繼續前進
We will move on from this.

318
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,260
朋友們
My friends,

319
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,380
我向你們保證...
I promise you...

320
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,780
只要團結一致  我們一定會繁榮昌盛
that together, we will prosper.

321
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,320
說得太好了
All right.

322
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,140
喂  你好  我還在聽
Yes, hi. I'm still here.

323
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,600
真的嗎  你確定
Really? Uh, are you sure?

324
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,870
當然  明白
Sure. Gotcha.

325
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,460
很抱歉打攪到您
Sorry for bothering you.

326
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,400
我打電話來是因為我們和你們有個預約
I'm calling because we had an appointment with you guys for,

327
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,180
我想想  星期三
I think, Wednesday?

328
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,890
老實告訴你
I'll be honest with you --

329
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,500
我寫的東西我自己都看不懂
I can barely read my own darn handwriting.

330
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,800
我的錯
My mistake.

331
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,370
好吧  祝你今天過得愉快
Okay. Have a nice day.

332
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,280
你好  我打來是想確認一下
Hello. I'm calling to confirm an appointment

333
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,760
和查爾斯·麥吉爾的預約

334
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,980
對  在圣克里斯托瓦爾路215號

麥吉爾  開頭字母是"M"
McGill, with an "M."

336
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,050
修門
A door?

337
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,310
好吧
Okay.

338
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,020
我以為是你們
I thought it was you guys.

339
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,360
我可能搞錯了
Guess I was wrong.

340
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
還是謝謝了
Thanks, anyway.

341
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,020
你好  我打來是為了
Hi! I'm calling about

342
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,140
和查爾斯·麥吉爾的一個預約
an appointment for Charles McGill.

343
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,130
我打來就是為了這個
Well, that's why I'm calling.

344
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,580
我想就是這星期了  但是...
I think it's for this week, but --

345
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,190
幸好我的腦袋還在原位  對嗎
Good thing my head's attached to my neck right?

346
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,700
圣克里斯托瓦爾  沒錯
San Cristobal -- that's right.

347
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,100
對  就是這個  明天兩點半
Yes, that's it! 2:30 tomorrow.

348
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,110
太好了
Great!

349
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,530
我們得取消這次預約
So, uh, we're gonna need to cancel that.

350
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,010
是的
Yeah.

351
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,340
我會的
I will.

352
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
謝謝你  再見
Thank you. Bye.

353
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,170
{\an8}明天
馬丁勤雜修理店

354
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,550
可憐的福瑞斯基
Poor Frisky.

355
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,430
波美拉尼亞人比較難搞  那頭發
Mm. Pomeranians can be difficult -- all that hair.

356
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,100
我知道
I know.

357
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,360
那瓦蘭斯夫人  周四十一點半可以嗎
So, Mrs. Vallance, does Thursday 11:30 work?

358
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,660
對
That's right.

359
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,520
不是吧
No.

360
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,500
真的
Really?

361
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,820
馬丁勤雜修理店  明天兩點半
Martin's Handyman and Repair -- 2:30 tomorrow.

362
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,790
謝謝
Thank you.

363
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,790
你打了多少電話才試出來的
How many calls did that take?

364
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,870
數不清了  寫好了嗎
I lost track. Is that it?

365
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,910
是的  我快做完了
Yeah. I'm nearly done.

366
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,640
我準備打悔過牌
I'm just giving it a remorse pass.

367
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,950
悔過很重要
Well, remorse is important.

368
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,330
"毀壞財產"
"Destroyed property."

369
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,350
我會寫"損壞"了受害者的財產
I'd try "Damaged" the victim's property

370
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,530
而不是"毀壞"財產
instead of "Destroyed" property.

371
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,970
看看這樣能不能好點
See if you can't get away with that.

372
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,090
好
Yeah.

373
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,430
好了
Boom.

374
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,590
這樣挺好的
That's nice.

375
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,520
順便告訴你  我是真心的
I mean it, by the way.

376
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,400
什么
What?

377
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,800
謝謝你
Thank you.

378
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,440
說真的
Seriously.

379
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,100
說真的  不客氣
You're welcome seriously.

380
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,910
我要接著忙了
I better get back to it.

381
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,640
好
Yeah.

382
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,420
你是不是...
Are you...?

383
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,240
你確定這個人能行嗎
You're absolutely sure you got the right guy for this?

384
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,870
高手中的高手
The crème de la crème.

385
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,750
馬丁修理店
Martin's Repair?

386
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,510
是的  麥吉爾先生
Yeah. Mr. McGill?

387
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,300
下午好
Good afternoon.

388
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,260
麻煩把鞋擦一下
If you don't mind wiping your shoes?

389
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,800
這邊走
It's this way.

390
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,030
當心  當心這邊的臺階
Mind -- Mind the step here.

391
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,140
如你所見  門框貼上了木板
Uh, as you'll see, the frame is boarded over,

392
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,310
但是門還是完好的
but the, uh, the door itself is intact.

393
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,860
主要是門側柱和門框壓條壞了
The damage is mainly to the doorjamb and the casing.

394
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,430
這邊還有一級臺階
There's another step up here.

395
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,820
有人闖進來了嗎
Break-in?

396
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,840
是的
That's right.

397
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,710
看上去是為了你的銅線
Went after your copper wire, from the look of it.

398
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,360
想當年  記得嗎
There was a time -- remember? --

399
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,580
我們可以不用鎖門
when we could leave our doors unlocked.

400
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,290
當然記得
I certainly do.

401
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,780
這個...
Well...

402
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,670
我在哪兒接電源
Where do I plug in?

403
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,040
不能插電
You don't.

404
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,260
-不能嗎  -不行
- No? - No.

405
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,770
你難道不能...
Didn't you --

406
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,780
我覺得我的助理已經和你們說得很清楚了
I believe my assistant was very clear with your dispatcher --

407
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,340
不能用電
no electricity,

408
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,990
原因已經解釋得夠詳細了
due to a condition that was explained in some detail.

409
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,570
沒問題
No problem.

410
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,720
幸好我給電池充了電
Good thing I charged my battery.

411
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,790
不然我就只能像摩登原始人一樣了
I'd be going at it like Fred Flintstone, otherwise.

412
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,080
很抱歉
I'm sorry!

413
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,770
很抱歉
I'm sorry!

414
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,820
我以為不會需要任何用電的工具
I understood there would be no power tools of any kind.

415
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,070
什么  螺絲刀和錘子嗎
What? A screwdriver and a hammer?

416
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,140
本來一早上能干完的活兒要我弄兩天
Turns a morning job into two days

417
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,080
還得賠上止痛膏藥嗎
with me, myself, and Bengay.

418
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,430
但是  還是你說了算
But...it's your call.

419
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,600
我覺得...
I suppose...

420
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,460
好吧  如果...
Very well, if --

421
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,470
你看起來很快就能搞完
You seem to be making fast work of it.

422
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,270
很好  很好
That's good. That's good.

423
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,740
好吧  那我就...
Okay, what I'll do, I think, is, uh...

424
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,610
很好
Very good.

425
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,960
太好了
Oh, yeah.

426
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,020
漂亮
Nice.

427
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,580
很好  漂亮
Great. Yep, nice.

428
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,990
我們也許該找個時間討論一下黃金分割法
At some point, we should probably discuss the rule of thirds,

429
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,770
不過這些...
but, otherwise, these, uh...

430
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,730
一疊《金融時報》上放著一盞煤油燈
A gas lantern sitting on a stack of friggin' Financial Times.

431
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,690
這可把來龍去脈都交代清楚了
Now, that tells the whole story.

432
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,770
這些照片都能放到博物館展出了
These are museum quality.

433
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,190
我的朋友  你簡直是偷拍界的大師
You, my friend, are the Ansel Adams of covert photography.

434
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,400
另外那樣東西呢
And that other thing?

435
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,050
你是怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

436
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,110
從他桌上的地址簿
Address book on his desk.

437
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,790
對哦
Right.

438
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,170
你覺得他怎么樣
So...What'dya think of him?

439
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,990
你可以有話直說  不會得罪我的
I mean, speak freely. You couldn't possibly offend me.

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
他挺混蛋的  對吧
He's a bit of a prick, right?

441
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,590
無話可說嗎
Nothing?

442
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,400
真的嗎
Seriously?

443
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,490
好吧
All right.

444
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,270
跟這人聊不了八卦
Can't even dish the dirt with this guy.

445
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,600
我們的合作不是結束了嗎
Isn't our business concluded?

446
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,490
是的  扯平了
Yeah, even Steven.

447
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,560
你的確把門修好了吧
I mean, you did fix the door, right?

448
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,530
是的
Yeah.

449
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,360
你修得還不錯吧
Y-You did a reasonably good job of it?

450
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,780
-否則  他會...  -他不會投訴的
- Because, otherwise, he'll be -- - He won't be grumbling to anyone.

451
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,290
那就行了
That's all I'm asking.

452
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,920
我修得很好
I did it right.

453
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,480
謝謝
Thank you.

454
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,250
終于有一次是修東西了
Nice to fix something for once.

455
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,070
如果你真那么想
Hell, if that's how you feel,

456
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,950
我辦公室還有個漏水的馬桶呢
I got a leaky toilet back at the office.

457
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,770
好了
All right.

458
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,800
如果你以后需要我幫忙...
If you ever need anything from my end...

459
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,440
再見
Hasta luego.

460
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:52,480
{\an8}《能工巧匠》

461
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,850
我們能談談嗎
May we talk?

462
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,230
你可以把車停到那邊
You can park it over there.

463
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,410
你把我們說好的酬勞退回來了
You sent back the payment we agreed upon.

464
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,890
我做那些事不是為了你
What I did, I didn't do for you.

465
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,140
那個男人
The man.

466
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,890
那個因為幫助貨車司機而被殺的人
The one killed for helping the truck driver.

467
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,610
容我多嘴
If I may make an observation...

468
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,020
也許你是想彌補過錯
Perhaps you are trying to correct something

469
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,780
一些無法挽回的事
which cannot be corrected.

470
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,500
我做這種事不是為了錢
It's not the kind of thing I want to take money for.

471
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,720
但事實仍然是  你的行為令我受益
But the fact remains that your actions

472
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,850
多到你無法想象
benefited me more than you can know.

473
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,490
那是你的事
That's your business.

474
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,580
我不用再煩惱塞拉曼加的事  就夠了
I'm just glad to have Salamanca out of my head.

475
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,490
也許將來...
Well, perhaps, in the future...

476
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,620
你會考慮為我工作
you will consider working for me.

477
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,750
也許吧
Could be.

478
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,910
得看具體工作內容
That'd depend on the work.

479
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,300
你想知道
Would you care to know

480
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,980
我為什么阻止你殺赫克托嗎
why I stopped you from killing Hector?

481
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,450
如你所說  那對你沒好處
Like you said -- it wasn't in your interest.

482
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,690
被一槍爆頭對他來說太仁慈了
A bullet to the head would have been far too humane.

483
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,260
吉米
Jimmy.

484
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,050
霍華德
Howard.

485
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,430
吉米
Jimmy.

486
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,860
霍華德
Howard.

487
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,130
金
Kim.

488
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,260
查克
Chuck.

489
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,640
金
Kim.

490
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,800
下午好
Good afternoon.

491
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,660
很好
Good.

492
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,860
麥吉爾先生  這樣可以嗎
Mr. McGill, does this work for you?

493
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,210
也只能這樣了  謝謝
It'll have to do. Thank you.

494
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,470
各位都把手機等電子產品
I assume everyone left their cellphones

495
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,090
-放到接待處了吧  -是的
- and so on at reception. - Yes, indeed.

496
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,950
如果你要休息一下或有其他需求  請告訴我
And you'll let me know if you need a break or anything else?

497
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,630
我會的  謝謝  海女士
I will. Thank you, Ms. Hay.

498
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,700
其實
You know...

499
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,290
我跟我先生說起過你的情況
I was actually speaking to my husband about your condition.

500
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,410
是嗎
Oh, yes?

501
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,770
我以前有個姨媽  她已經過世了
I had an aunt. She's no longer with us.

502
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,490
她每周日都到教堂去
She went to church every Sunday,

503
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,760
可是當唱詩班的孩子開始唱歌
but when the boys' choir sang,

504
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,100
她就必須離開
she would absolutely have to leave.

505
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,740
他們聲音的頻率
Something about the frequency of their voices

506
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,440
讓她受不了
really did a number on her.

507
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,600
-那太可惜了  -確實
- Well, that is a shame. - Indeed.

508
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,770
好了
All right.

509
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,630
我們開始吧
Let's get down to it.

510
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,540
我們今天要落實
We are here to finalize

511
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,250
詹姆斯·摩根·麥吉爾的訴前轉移
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion for James Morgan McGill.

512
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,760
代理被轉移人的是金柏莉·韋克斯勒女士
Representing the divertee, Ms. Kimberly Wexler.

513
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,410
詹姆斯·麥吉爾先生簽了一份協議
Mr. James McGill has signed a contract

514
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,230
在法定訴訟時效內
waiving his rights to a speedy trial

515
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,040
放棄快速審判和案件陳述的權利
and presentment of his case within the statute of limitations.

516
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,440
協議條款要求你  詹姆斯
The terms of the deal are for you, James,

517
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,790
在未來十二個月內  于每月第二個周一
to report to your Pre-Prosecution Service Officer

518
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,320
到阿爾布開克地檢辦公室
at the Albuquerque District Attorney's Office

519
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,420
向訴前事務官報到
on the second Monday of every month for the next 12 months.

520
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,780
屆時會分配社區服務時長
Community service hours will be assigned.

521
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,050
你必須保持合法就業
You must maintain lawful employment.

522
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,120
只能和守法公民來往
Must only associate with law-abiding citizens.

523
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,530
你的委托人是否明白
Your client understands that,

524
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,190
如果他違反協議條款
if he violates the terms of the agreement

525
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,720
或者因違法被捕
or is arrested for any infraction,

526
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,640
他在此供認的罪名
the crimes to which he has confessed here

527
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,410
將連同新的罪名一起
will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,

528
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,960
依法受到最大限度的追訴
in addition to any new charges?

529
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,140
他明白
He understands.

530
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,800
我必須告知你  麥吉爾先生
And I must inform you, Mr. McGill,

531
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,000
作為一名律師及律師協會成員
as an officer of the court and member of the bar,

532
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,850
你的供詞將會被提交給
your confession will be referred

533
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,400
新墨西哥律師協會
to the New Mexico Bar Association.

534
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,830
好了  我這里有份你的陳述
Okay. I have your statement here.

535
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,920
有誰事先讀過了嗎
Has everyone had a chance to read it?

536
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,300
有什么評論或想法
Comments? Thoughts?

537
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,870
第二頁上說  他"損壞了被害人的財產"
Actually, page 2, he "Damaged the victim's property."

538
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,130
可不可以更準確地改成
Would it not be more accurate to say

539
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,310
"毀壞了一盤錄音帶"
"Destroyed a cassette tape"?

540
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,950
抱歉  錄音帶難道不是他的財產嗎
I'm sorry. Wasn't the cassette tape his property?

541
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,210
-當然是  -那說他損壞了
- Of course it was. - Then it seems entirely accurate to say

542
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,140
被害人的財產十分準確
he damaged the victim's property.

543
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,250
為什么含糊其辭
Why be vague?

544
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,210
并且"損壞"不能說明其無法挽回的后果
And "Damaged" doesn't reflect its irrevocable condition --

545
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,450
好  改成"損壞了被害人的私人物品"
Fine. "Damaged property belonging to the victim."

546
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,970
是錄音帶
It was a cassette tape.

547
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,530
事實就是如此  不是茶杯  或者椅子
That's what it was -- not a teacup, not a chair --

548
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,180
-是一盤錄音帶  -沒錯
- a cassette tape. - Yeah.

549
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,660
改成"毀壞私人財產"怎么樣
How about "Destroyed item of personal property"?

550
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
行
All right.

551
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,610
我們建議改成"毀壞私人財產"
Uh, we'd suggest "Destroyed item of personal property."

552
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,400
韋克斯勒小姐
Ms. Wexler?

553
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,210
無異議
Works for us.

554
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,600
那我是不是該修改一下  還是...
Shall I change it, or...?

555
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,840
請便
If you would.

556
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:12,890
"毀壞私人財產"
"Destroyed item of personal property."

557
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,930
好了
There.

558
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,170
請您簽上姓名的首字母
Can you initial it, please?

559
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,540
"JMM"  簽好了
"JMM." Initialed.

560
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,220
查爾斯  您對您弟弟的陳述還有其他
Charles, was there anything else you found wanting

561
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,840
欠缺的地方嗎
in your brother's statement?

562
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,520
沒有了
No.

563
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,280
我們很滿意  謝謝您
We're satisfied. Thank you.

564
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,330
好  我們完事了吧
All right. So, we're all set.

565
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,050
不  還沒完  麥吉爾先生
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.

566
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,000
你哥哥或許滿意了  但我還沒有
Your brother may be satisfied, but I am not.

567
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,540
你寫的供詞還說過得去
The confession you've written is adequate,

568
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,010
但老實說  我覺得缺少悔意
but, frankly, I-I sense a lack of remorse.

569
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,010
我希望您有所行動  比如道個歉
And I, for one, would like to hear an apology.

570
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,160
這是查爾斯最起碼應得的
Charles deserves at least that much.

571
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,070
現在嗎
Now?

572
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,870
是的  麥吉爾先生  現在
Yes, Mr. McGill, now.

573
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,830
好吧
Okay.

574
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,830
我錯了
I was wrong.

575
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,870
麥吉爾先生  說的時候能直視你哥哥嗎
Mr. McGill, could you at least look your brother in the eye?

576
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,130
查克  我真的很抱歉
Chuck... I'm very sorry.

577
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,140
我發了脾氣  做了一些事...
I lost my temper, and I did some things --

578
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,340
很多讓我后悔不已的事
so many things that I regret.

579
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,370
我不應該砸壞你的門
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

580
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,700
不管我有多么生氣
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

581
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,950
都不應該那樣做
I-I shouldn't have done that.

582
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,980
我不會為此或者自己所說的話找借口
There's no excuse for that. Or for the things that I said.

583
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,850
我非常懊悔
I regret it all,

584
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,960
后悔到你完全無法想象
all of it more than you can imagine,

585
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,330
因為...
because...

586
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,360
你是我的哥哥
'cause you're my brother,

587
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,390
沒人應該那樣對待自己的兄弟
and no one should treat his own brother like that.

588
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,810
永遠不會
Not ever.

589
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,290
可以嗎
Okay?

590
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,060
好的
All right, then.

591
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,180
我們接下來談談賠償問題
On to the matter of restitution.

592
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,080
麥吉爾先生  根據協議書規定
Mr. McGill, according to your agreement,

593
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,820
您有兩周時間賠償您的哥哥

海女士  我很抱歉

598
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,000
這個數字沒有囊括所有的金額
That figure doesn't represent a full accounting.

599
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,630
是嗎
Oh, no?

600
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,940
賠償金額應該是323.98美元

601

把你送回家怎么樣
What do you say we get you home?

607
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,930
霍華德  查克
Howard. Chuck.

608
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,360
關于聽證會我得警告你們
I'm putting you both on notice regarding the bar hearing.

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,900
第一件  我會提交對錄音的查禁請求
The first thing, I'm filing a motion to suppress that tape.

610
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,250
你是說  吉米毀掉的那盤錄音
The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?

611
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,270
我們就別兜圈子了吧
How about we stop with the games?

612
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,080
你們肯定還有副本
There's no way there isn't a duplicate.

613
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,290
是嗎
Really?

614
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,880
絕對還有
Of course there is.

615
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,360
你們早就知道吉米會闖進去
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.

616
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,540
你們正希望如此
You wanted him to.

617
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,660
你們不會任由他毀掉那盤錄音
There's no way you were gonna let him destroy

618
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,400
僅存的原件  所以肯定復制了副本
the only copy of that tape, so you made a duplicate --

619
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,210
你們一開始就準備好了
it's the first thing you did.

620
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,970
金  披露不是這樣做的
Kim...this is not how we do discovery.

621
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,510
事實上  吉米毀掉了副本
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

622
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,770
沒關系  霍華德
It's fine, Howard.

623
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,340
原件被妥善地保管著
The original is under lock and key,

624
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,520
在適當的時間
and in due time,

625
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,090
會被拿來當做證據
it will be put into evidence for your review.

626
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,620
所以  你想提交動議就提交吧
So, of course, file whatever motions you'd like.

627
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,620
這是你的權利
It's your privilege.

628
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,600
我會的  等著吧
I will. Count on it.

629
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,990
但是  金  你應該知道...
But, Kim, you should be aware --

630
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,280

第一次參加紀律聽證會
your first disciplinary hearing --

632
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,320
律師協會所要求的舉證標準
uh, the Bar Association's standard of proof

633
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,270
比你習以為常的那套要仁慈多了
is far more lenient than what you're used to.

634
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,840
撇開動議  那盤錄音帶會被播放的
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

635
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,860
-查克  -好
- Chuck. - Yeah.

636
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,440
再見  金
See you, Kim.

637
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,840
怎么樣
Well?

638
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,770
怎么了
What?

639
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,020
猜對了
Bingo.
