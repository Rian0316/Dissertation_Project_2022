1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,003
我和我的兄弟姊妹是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
ELlJAH: My siblings and I
are the first vampires in history.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,901
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,874
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
这个城市
Three hundred years ago,
we helped to build the city of New Orleans.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,945
我们一家人曾经在这里
We were happy here.

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,513
很快乐
A family.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,776
最近，一群女巫把我弟弟引诱回来
Recently, a coven of
witches lured my brother back,

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,977
利用他未出生的孩子做筹码
using his unborn child as leverage.

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,480
我试图帮他
但他却把我出卖给了他的敌人
ELlJAH: I tried to help him,
but he betrayed me to his enemy,

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,682
吸血鬼马赛尔
the vampire Marcel.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,693
从那时起，我被一个强大的女巫掌控着
Since then, I've been held
prisoner by a powerful witch.

11
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:34,458
我弟弟试图操纵他人来解救我
My brother seeks to manipulate others
to procure my release.

12
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,894
但我有自己的计划
But I have my own plan.

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,369
如果这个女巫真的是敌人
If this witch proves to be an enemy,

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,236
我会不惜一切代价阻止她
I will stop her by whatever
means necessary.

15
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,050
他们都说你是可敬的
You're the one they call honorable.

16
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,862
是的
Yes.

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,770
他们是这么说我的
That's what they call me.

18
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,506
然而我跟随我弟弟来到这里
来到纽奥良参与战争
And yet I followed my brother here
to New Orleans to engage in a war.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,937
那么
So...

20
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,478
我问你
...I ask you...

21
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,782
你觉得这听起来可敬吗？
...does that sound honorable to you?

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,387
你脸色不太好
You don't look well.

23
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,420
要不是今天早上
我的胸口里还插着一把神秘的匕首
Well, only this morning, I had a
mystical dagger embedded in my chest.

24
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,359
我得说我还是相当把持得住的
So, I'd say I'm holding
myself together quite well.

25
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:45,069
黛维娜，我相信你和我有能力
在女巫和吸血鬼的战争开始之前
Davina, I believe that you and l
have the power to end a war between

26
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,536
就终止这一切
witches and vampires
before it truly begins.

27
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,973
我会管好我的弟弟
你就做好你自己
I, by keeping my brother in line.
You, by behaving as your true self,

28
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,842
而不是马赛尔或女巫的工具
not some tool for Marcel
or the witches.

29
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,609
我凭什么相信你？
And why should I trust you?

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,152
首先，尽管我饥肠辘辘
Well, for one thing,
in spite of a ravenous hunger,

31
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,187
我也没有试图要吸你的血
I have not tried to take your blood.

32
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,190
为什么不呢？这里就只有我
And why not?
I'm the only one here.

33
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:13,093
即使是现在这样的状态
我也不会去吸一个孩子的血
Even in my present condition,
I would not feed from a child.

34
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,284
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）

主演：克莱儿荷特

38
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,302
我们说好的
KLAUS: We had a deal.

39
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,670
你保护我未出生的孩子
主演：菲比托金
You protect my unborn child,

40
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,269
我瓦解马赛尔的军队
主演：菲比托金
I dismantle Marcel's army.

41
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,779
在我一直忙着做好我该做的事情时
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
And whilst I've been busy
fulfilling my part of the bargain,

42
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,474
你让海莉受到了攻击
you allowed Hayley to be attacked

43
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,486
差点被一群疯女巫杀死
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
and almost killed

44
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,350
差点被一群疯女巫杀死
by a gaggle of lunatic witches.

45
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,455
这与我毫无关系，我发誓
I had nothing to do with it, I swear.

46
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,454
我和海莉是连结在一起的，记得吗？
Hayley and I are linked, remember?

47
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,320
她死，我也会死
She dies, I die.

48
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,482
那么那些人是谁？
Then who were they?

49
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,595
他们是一小群极端份子
They're a faction of extremists.

50
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,321
莎宾愚蠢地告诉了他们
主演：莉雅派普斯
Sabine stupidly told them about

51
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,026
她看到的这个孩子的一些幻象
some vision she had about the baby.

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,189
什么幻象？
What kind of vision?

53
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,398
她总能看到幻象，绝对是可以解读的
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
She has them all the time.
They're totally open
to interpretation.

54
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,129
我猜这次她错了
I'm guessing she's wrong on this one.

55
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,833
容我问一句，这个特别的幻象
她是如何解读？
Well, how, may I ask,
was this particular vision interpreted?

56
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,576
大致就是你的孩子
将导致所有女巫死亡
Pretty much that your baby
would bring death to all witches.

57
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,479
我突然更加喜欢这个孩子了
Ah, well, I grow fonder of
this child by the second.

58
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,052
苏菲，听着我向以利亚保证过
制片：兰斯安德森
Sophie, look. I promised Elijah
that I would protect the Mikaelson

59
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:20,151
我会保护米卡森家的奇迹之子
同时他会试图获得女巫黛维娜的忠诚
miracle baby whilst he tries to win,
your witch, Davina's loyalty.

60
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,523
不如你告诉我
这一小群人有多极端呢？
Why don't you tell me just
how extreme this faction is?

61
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,161
以利亚在和黛维娜谈？
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
Elijah's talking to Davina?

62
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,461
对，就在我们说话这时，我想是
Yeah, as we speak, I imagine.

63
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,765
我想她对那一小群人会有许多要说的
I'm guessing she'll have
plenty to say about that crowd.

64
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,571
请说吧
Do tell.

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,639
我并非一直都是女巫的支持者
I wasn't always an advocate
for the witches.

66
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,075
（八个月前）

67
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,115
喝光吧，各位
Whoo!
Drink up, everybody!

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,585
他们在里约就是这样开派对的
This is how they party in Rio!

69
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,284
我姊姊像我父母那样献身于女巫
My sister was
devoted like our parents,

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,690
我们的教育非常严格
编剧：玛格丽特麦金泰尔
and our upbringing was very strict,

71
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,889
快把我逼疯了
编剧：茱莉普烈克
which drove me nuts.

72
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,528
我一到21岁
就离开法语区旅行，放纵
The minute I turned 21,
I left the Quarter to travel and play.

73
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,802
但我想做个厨师
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
But I wanted to be a chef,

74
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,203
所以我回到了卢梭酒吧
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
so I came back to Rousseau's.

75
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,907
简安
Oh! Jane-Anne!

76
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,779
嘿
Hey!

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,617
刚刚那个不是我
That wasn't me.

78
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,982
嗨
Hi!

79
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,589
哦
Oh!

80
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,281
欢迎回家，苏菲
Welcome home, Soph.

81
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,892
我们能去别处聊聊吗？
Can we go someplace to talk?

82
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,992
说吧
Just tell me.

83
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,021
长老们要求举行投票
The elders called a vote.

84
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,189
我们正在筹划收获祭
We're moving
forward with the Harvest.

85
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,327
什么？
What?

86
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,194
收获祭是什么鬼东西？
What the bloody hell is the Harvest?

87
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,568
是我们女巫每三百年就会做一次的仪式
那样我们与祖先的魔法
It's a ritual our coven does every
three centuries so that the bond

88
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,470
会重新恢复联系
to our ancestral magic is restored.

89
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,170
我们安抚我们的祖先
他们就会让我们祖传的力量得以延续
We appease our ancestors, they keep
our ancestral power flowing.

90
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,905
我怎么没听说过？
And why haven't I heard of this?

91
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,414
因为收获祭总是被认为是神话
Because the Harvest
always seemed like a myth,

92
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,643
一代代传下来的故事
a story passed down
through generations.

93
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,085
就像诺亚方舟或是佛陀在水上行走
Like Noah's ark or the
Buddha walking on water.

94
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,883
有些人真的相信
The kind some people take literally,

95
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,821
有些却不信
and some people don't.

96
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,762
如欲重生，必先牺牲
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

97
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,361
如欲重生，必先牺牲
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

98
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,627
如欲重生，必有信仰
To be reborn, we must have faith.

99
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,366
如欲重生，必有信仰
To be reborn, we must have faith.

100
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,941
你相信收获祭吗？
Do you have faith in the Harvest?

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,303
一点也不信
Not for a second!

102
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,174
苏菲
一嘘
-Sophie.
-Shh.

103
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,642
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

104
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,978
拯救你放弃的团体
Saving the community you renounced.

105
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,018
你们都太荒谬了
You're all ridiculous!

106
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,088
莫妮克？不是吧？
Monique? Seriously?

107
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,157
我妈妈告诉我我必须这么做
My mom told me I had to.

108
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,518
是啊，那我要跟你妈妈谈谈了
Yeah. Well, your mom and l
are gonna have words.

109
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,531
她们让一些女孩准备了几个月
SOPHlE: They had the girls of our
community preparing for months.

110
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,002
会有四个被选中用来献祭
Four would be chosen for the Harvest.

111
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,040
她们说那是一种荣誉
她们很特别
They said that it was an honor,
that they were special.

112
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,938
我觉得那只是个神话
I thought it was a myth.

113
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,305
那是吗？
Was it?

114
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,816
马赛尔
Marcel.

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,945
这个时间对你来说有点早了吧？
Bit early in the day for you, isn't it?

116
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,353
我知道，我让一切看起来很简单
但我还是有一个帝国要管理
I know. I make this look easy,
but I still have an empire to run.

117
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,788
幸好是你不是我
Rather you than me.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,258
那些职责似乎很让人厌烦呢
All that responsibility
seems like such a bore.

119
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,829
有件事你应该会感兴趣
Well, this might spice things up.

120
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,626
我刚听说在河口有一群死掉的巫师
I just heard about a bunch of dead
witches out in the bayou.

121
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,032
似乎是狼人干的
只不过昨天不是满月
The kind of damage a werewolf might do,
only there was no full moon.

122
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,001
我得去见一个线人
I have an informant out
there I need to meet,

123
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,697
我很希望你能陪我去
and I would love for you
to go with me.

124
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,603
河口死掉的巫师
Dead witches in the bayou.

125
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,076
听起来不算是什么麻烦
更像是值得庆祝的事情
Sounds like less of a problem and
more like a cause for celebration.

126
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,272
有东西杀了他们
也许还在某处
Well, something killed them
and may still be out there,

127
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,510
而你的血是治愈狼人咬伤的唯一办法
and with your blood the
only cure for a werewolf bite....

128
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,620
我很希望你陪我走一趟
I would love for you to accompany me.

129
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,149
为什么不呢？
我很久没去河口了
Well, why not?
I haven't been to the bayou in ages.

130
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,519
这就来
I'm on my way.

131
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,092
再见，兄弟
Peace out, brother.

132
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,728
就是这个
This is the one.

133
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,159
你现在不能出去
SOPHlE: You can't go out there now.

134
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,766
我得聚集巫师的遗体，把他们献祭
I need to gather the witches'
remains and consecrate them.

135
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,459
如果在日落前没做到
If I don't get to
them before sundown,

136
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,933
我们就会失去与他们魔法的联系
we lose the link to their magic.

137
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,834
那些巫师试图杀死海莉
Those witches tried to kill Hayley.

138
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,999
我希望马赛尔的线人
找不到任何会将他
I prefer for Marcel's informant not
to find anything that would lead him

139
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,839
指引到我们、她，或者
你知道的，那个
back to us, to her,
or to, you know, that.

140
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,947
你们都是一类人
You are all class.

141
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,573
乖乖待着，等我回来再继续你的故事
Stay put and save the rest
of your story 'til I return.

142
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,716
瞧瞧谁回来了
Look who's back.

143
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,795
来探望你关在阁楼的囚犯吗？
Here to visit your
prisoner in the attic?

144
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,329
歇歇吧
她不是囚犯
Lay off.
She's not a prisoner.

145
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,434
我今晚就会带她离开这里
太多人知道她在哪了
And I'm moving her tonight.
Too many people know where she is.

146
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,230
自从我离开之后
I've been hearing about
what you've been up to

147
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,530
就一直听闻你的事
since I've been out of town.

148
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,162
利用那个女孩阻止女巫使用魔法？
Using that girl to keep
the witches from doing magic?

149
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,177
无意冒犯，基神父
如果你打算维护女巫的权利
All respect, Father K. If you're
gonna defend the witches' rights,

150
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,404
我们就没什么好说的了
we got nothing to talk about.

151
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,551
你拉小提琴？
Do you play?

152
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,752
那个…不是我的
That's not mine.

153
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,872
好消息，小黛
Good news, little D.

154
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,599
我要带你离开这个满是灰尘的地方
I'm moving you out
of this pile of dust.

155
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,970
真的吗？什么时候？
Are you serious? When?

156
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,908
今晚
我只需再做些准备
Tonight. I just need to lock in
the arrangements.

157
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,445
我们的真祖怎么样了？
How's our Original?

158
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,507
别动他
Don't disturb the body.

159
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,551
我正在施咒呢
I have a spell in progress.

160
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,353
好吧
快点收拾，只带你想带的
I bet you do. Pack up, okay?
Only what you wanna take.

161
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,116
其他需要的东西我会再买给你
I'll buy you anything else you need.

162
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,521
好
Okay.

163
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,271
你没告诉他我已经醒了
You didn't reveal that I was awake.

164
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,237
我们还没聊完呢
We're not done talking yet.

165
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,074
你和马赛尔看起来很亲密
You and Marcel seem very close.

166
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,877
马赛尔是我的家人
Marcel is my family.

167
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,918
但马赛尔却喜欢伤害女巫
And yet Marcel is someone who
delights in harming the witches.

168
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,085
我觉得那些人才是你该认为是家人的人
Those people, I would think,
you would consider family.

169
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,852
这不让你困扰吗？
This doesn't trouble you?

170
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,358
不
No.

171
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,791
她们活该
They deserve it.

172
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,422
你为什么那么说？
Why would you say that?

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,966
因为她们是骗子，全都是
'Cause they're liars, all of them.

174
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,100
她们让我和我朋友做这个收获祭仪式
They made me and my friends
do this Harvest ritual.

175
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:15,613
她们说我们的参与
会为我们的家人带来力量，健康
They said our participation would
bring our family strength, health.

176
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,481
我们会永远被尊为
这群女巫的救世主
That we'd forever be celebrated
as saviors of the community.

177
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,687
但她们真正想要的只是更多的力量
But all they really
wanted was more power.

178
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,462
所以我在她们得手前就离开了
So, I left before they could get it.

179
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,397
现在她们就快没时间了
因为收获祭之后
And now they're running out of time
because after the Harvest

180
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,967
就是收割
如果她们不能完成仪式
comes the Reaping.
And if they don't complete the Harvest,

181
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,467
就不会有收割
there won't be a Reaping.

182
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,735
很快，法语区所有的女巫
就会开始失去她们的力量
Soon, all the witches in the Quarter
will start to lose their power.

183
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,039
最后，她们将不再是女巫了
Eventually, they'll cease
to be witches altogether.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,648
那要如何才能完成这个仪式呢？
So what does it take
to complete this ritual?

185
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,247
我必须死
I have to die.

186
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,943
嘿，搞什么？
Hey. What the hell?

187
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,203
你反正是要出去的，不是吗？
You're going out
there anyway, aren't you?

188
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,038
我想和你一起走
I wanna go with you.

189
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,546
不，谢了
今天早上已经被克劳斯威胁过了
No thanks. Already got assaulted
by Klaus this morning.

190
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,706
不想再来一次
Don't need a repeat.

191
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,854
如果那个害死那些巫师的东西
What if whatever is responsible
for all those dead witches

192
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,045
还在外面呢？
is still out there?

193
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,588
我们已经确定那家伙喜欢我
讨厌女巫
We've already established that
it likes me and hates witches.

194
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,989
所以你和我在一起会更安全
So you'll be safer with me.

195
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,085
抱歉，我可不信你会突然关心我的安全
Sorry if I'm not buying your
sudden concern for my safety.

196
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,593
听着
我一开始来到这个破城市的原因
Listen. The whole reason I came to
this stupid town in the first place

197
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,531
就是为了多了解我的家人
was to learn more about my family.

198
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,195
是你姊姊告诉我
马赛尔把所有狼人
Your sister is the one that told me
Marcel ran the werewolves

199
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,398
从法语区赶到了河口
而昨晚
out of the Quarter into the bayou.
And last night,

200
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,305
我很确定是某个狼人守护天使救了我
pretty sure that some
guardian angel wolf saved my life.

201
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,706
所以我要和你一起去
So I'm coming with you.

202
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,211
你们俩能再傻一点吗？
Could you two be more idiotic?

203
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,180
两个人够玩追踪游戏了
Two can play the follow game,
you know?

204
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,753
你们听到克劳斯的话了
他和马赛尔正在去你们要去的地方
You heard Klaus. He and Marcel are
heading right where you're going.

205
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,725
那就分散他们的注意力
除非你想把一个
So distract them. Because
unless you wanna lock a hormonal,

206
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,794
荷尔蒙过剩的怀孕狼人关在墓穴里
我和你一起去
pregnant werewolf in a tomb,
I'm coming with you.

207
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,329
如果以利亚听到我和宝宝
因为窒息而死
And wouldn't Elijah be mad
if he hears that the baby and l

208
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,296
不知道他会不会很生气？
died of asphyxiation?

209
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,170
怎么了，蕾贝卡？
我和你前男友出去你生气了吗？
What's the matter, Rebekah?
You cross that I'm out with your ex?

210
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,936
怎么回事，你那边吵死了
What is all that dreadful
hillbilly ruckus in the background?

211
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,570
从这该死的招牌来看
这里是大奥吉河口酒吧
According to the dreadful signage,
it's Big Auggie's Bayou Bar.

212
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,546
多点几杯威士忌酒
Well, order up a few rounds
of moonshine

213
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,912
暂时离死掉的巫师远点
and stay clear of the
dead witches for a few.

214
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,419
那女巫在执行葬礼任务
你孩子的妈正享受精神探索
The witch is on a burial mission,
your baby mama is on a spirit quest,

215
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,683
而我要连守以利亚的约定保证她的安全
and I'm keeping Elijah's
promise to keep her safe.

216
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,759
所以拜托你拖一拖
So stall, please.

217
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,199
没事吧？
Everything okay?

218
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,865
一如既往
Just the usual.

219
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,567
喜怒无常的妹妹啊
Temperamental sister.

220
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,545
你的线人呢？
So, where's your informant?

221
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,580
汤玛斯？他现在在外面四处打探呢
Tomas?
He's out sniffing around.

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,149
来杯酒，然后我们再找他
Grab a drink,
then we'll chase him down.

223
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,954
我想这是我们聊聊的好机会
Well, I suppose it will give us
a chance to talk things over,

224
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,489
比如你为什么还不把以利亚还给我
Iike why you haven't returned Elijah.

225
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,390
也许你的小女巫
越来越喜欢他的陪伴了
Maybe your young witch
has grown partial to his company.

226
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,532
她一定是太无聊了
She must get so bored.

227
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,464
你就是不放弃，是吗？
You never stop, do you?

228
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,434
你就是不回答，是吗？
You never answer, do you?

229
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,129
你为什么对黛维娜那么好奇？
Why are you so curious about Davina?

230
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,004
如果我有一个16岁的强大女巫
对我言听计从
If I had a 16-year-old all-powerful
witch at my beck and call,

231
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,043
你也会对她很好奇的
you would wonder about her too.

232
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,014
你绝不会得到她的
You're never gonna get her.

233
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,673
好吧
Okay.

234
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,909
好吧
Okay.

235
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,615
那我问个无关紧要的问题吧
I'll ask the
harmless questions, then.

236
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,086
你怎么认识她的？
How did you meet her?

237
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,918
这也许会让你惊讶
That might surprise you.

238
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,396
八个月前
就在我禁止女巫使用魔法前
This was eight months ago, before
I banned the witches from using magic.

239
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,132
吸血鬼和女巫的关系
Relations between vampires and witches

240
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,704
不管怎样，虽然算不上
所谓的友好
weren't what you'd call friendly,
by any means.

241
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,934
但这么说吧
我们也没那么多分歧
But let's just say,
we were a little less divided.

242
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,511
事实上，我们一些人还相处得蛮好
In fact, some of us were
getting along just fine.

243
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,820
完蛋了
It's so screwed up.

244
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,195
我要面对精神失常的激进女巫
I'm dealing with whacked out,
militant witches.

245
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,302
在你看来，所有女巫都有点疯在
Hey, you witches all
got a little crazy in you.

246
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,769
我姊姊这次真的是太极端了
And my sister's really
gone off the deep end this time.

247
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,170
是啊，简安就是极端的殉道者
Yeah. Jane-Anne has got
martyr written all over her.

248
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,401
这是肯定的
That's for sure.

249
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:42,138
我们当中所有16岁女孩都在她们手上
她们都想成为那场
They've got every 16-year-old girl
in our coven dying to be one of the four

250
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,373
荒诞仪式上的那四个祭品之一
chosen for this crazy-ass ritual.

251
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,109
要我帮忙吗？
Anything I can do to help?

252
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,653
不要，你和她们的过节已经够多了
No. You've caused enough
trouble with them.

253
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,312
我哪有那么厉害？
What, little, old me?

254
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,284
你这个浑球
You're a dick.

255
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,451
你总是和女巫挑起事端
You always stir it
up with the witches,

256
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,860
这就是为什么这件事…
which is why this...

257
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,529
只有你我知道即可
...stays between us.

258
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,897
你和苏菲有一腿
KLAUS: You and Sophie.

259
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,908
你这伪君子
You hypocrite.

260
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,471
你折磨那些女巫，而自己却和
You torture those witches,
and yet there you are,

261
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,208
苏菲德弗罗玩着
罗密欧与朱丽叶的浪漫戏码
getting positively Romeo and Juliet
with Sophie Deveraux.

262
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,976
可不能这么说
It wasn't like that.

263
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,882
这是一个各取所需的男女关系
It was a mutually satisfying hookup.

264
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,857
这么说苏菲在她最需要的时候
没找你这个
So, if Sophie didn't turn to you,
her secret vampire lover,

265
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,590
地下吸血鬼情人帮忙
那她怎么做的？
in her hour of need,
what did she do?

266
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,700
她做了所有好女孩都会做的事
She did what any good girl would do.

267
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,596
她去找了她的神父
She went to her priest.

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,672
你从不关心女巫的事，苏菲
WOMAN: You've never cared
about witch business, Sophie,

269
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,003
而你现在竟好意思把我们的
秘密行动透露给外人
and now you have the gall to reveal
our private dealings to an outsider.

270
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,576
你得另辟蹊径了
You have to find another way.

271
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,042
你觉得我们做这些容易吗？
You think we do this lightly?

272
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,408
法语区的吸血鬼势力越渐壮大
The vampire presence in the
Quarter is growing stronger.

273
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,484
我们需要更大的力量去抵御他们
We need more power to fight them off.

274
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,380
艰难的时期要有强硬的对策
Harsh times call for harsh measures.

275
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,044
这不仅仅是强硬了，贝丝蒂娜
This is a little more
than harsh, Bastianna.

276
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,349
你不理解是因为你不相信
You don't understand
because you don't believe.

277
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,086
你从未相信过
You've never believed.

278
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,593
但是我相信，我愿为此孤注一掷
But I believe enough to put
everything on the line for this.

279
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,255
被选中为祭品
是种荣耀
And being chosen for the offering,
it's an honor.

280
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,561
是个谬论，简安
It's a myth, Jane-Anne.

281
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,500
你们的所作所为不仅是错的
What you are planning
to do is not only wrong,

282
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,537
在这个城市里，还是违法的
in my city, it's illegal.

283
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,676
在这个吸血鬼横行的城市吗？
In your city full of vampires?

284
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,676
这里的吸血鬼和人类已经达成共识
The vampires and the human faction
have an arrangement,

285
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,905
就像我们和你们之间一样
just like we have with you all.

286
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,107
保护当地百姓，保护家园
Protect the locals,
protect our homes,

287
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,808
我们选择了另一种方式
we look the other way.

288
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,614
而你们的做法太激进了
What you are planning goes too far.

289
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,518
我们只是要回我们需要的
We are simply taking what we need.

290
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,626
我们和祖先的联系日益减弱
Our connection to our
ancestors weakens over time.

291
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,524
一分耕耘一分收获
收获祭就是这样
You sow, and you reap.
That's the way the Harvest works.

292
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:43,066
我是你们女巫在这个城市唯一的朋友
I am the only ally you witches
have in this town.

293
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,432
你们真的想孤军对抗马赛尔吗？
Do you really wanna face
Marcel without me?

294
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,402
因为如果你们执意要举行收获祭
Because that is what
you'll be dealing with

295
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,098
就会面临这个问题
if you go through with the Harvest.

296
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,106
没事吧，基兰叔叔？
Everything okay in here, Uncle Kieran?

297
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,537
我们刚说完，西恩
We were just finishing, Sean.

298
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,945
是吧？
Right?

299
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,848
我想我已经把话说清楚了
I believe I've made myself clear.

300
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,078
我们会把这个问题交给长老处理
We'll take this matter to the elders.

301
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,883
继续学习，西恩
Continue to study, Sean.

302
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,723
你的叔叔是个很好的榜样
Your uncle is an excellent role model.

303
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,637
女巫们对基兰很生气
MARCEL: The witches
were furious with Kieran.

304
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,172
苏菲告诉我女巫对他的侄子西恩下了咒
Sophie tells me that the witches
put a hex on his nephew, Sean.

305
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,333
使他逐渐丧失理智
Made it seem like
he was slowly losing his mind,

306
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,072
以分散基兰的注意力
好让她们继续准备仪式
in order to distract Kieran
while they kept planning for the Harvest.

307
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,010
也就是说她们对基兰的侄子下手
So they attacked Kieran's nephew.

308
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,516
对
Yeah.

309
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,780
那孩子之后就变了
变得很暴力
Kid wasn't the same after that.
Ended up going postal,

310
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,753
杀了他神学院所有的同学
killing all his
fellow seminary students,

311
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,123
所有人，最后自杀了
all of them, and then himself.

312
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,162
我好像在哪看到过
I might have read about that.

313
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:51,433
那孩子杀了一个双胞胎
还是他就是双胞胎之一或什么的
The boy killed a twin,
or he was a twin or something.

314
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,867
不不，他们说他有个双胞胎妹妹
Oh, no, no.
They said that he had a twin sister.

315
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,709
告诉我
So, enlighten me.

316
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,044
你说你必须死是什么意思？
What did you mean
when you said you had to die?

317
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,813
收获祭就是这样
That's what the Harvest was.

318
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,083
她们说要把我们四个女孩置于一种
They said they'd put us
four girls in a state of, like,

319
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,282
安宁的状态，作为祭品
peaceful limbo as part
of the offering,

320
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,987
之复我们将在收割时
苏醒并重生
and then later at the Reaping,
we'd awaken and be reborn.

321
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,691
我没到达那个状态
I never got as far as the limbo part,

322
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,960
也就是说仪式没有完成
which means the Harvest
isn't complete.

323
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,833
这也就是女巫们很生气的原因
That's why the witches
are so freaked out.

324
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,701
收割的期限就要到了
The Reaping is just around the corner,

325
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,297
如果在此之前没有完成，就都结束了
and if they don't finish it before then,
it's over.

326
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,772
我要做的就是耐心等待
All I have to do is wait it out.

327
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,243
然后呢？
And then what?

328
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,575
她们会受到惩罚，我就解脱了
They're punished, and I'm free.

329
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,012
从马赛尔的禁锢中解脱吗？
From Marcel?

330
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,285
从魔法的禁锢
Of magic.

331
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,654
我们的法力都会逐渐消逝
All our power will drain away.

332
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,523
我会变成普通人
I'll be normal.

333
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,564
这是你想要的吗，变成普通人？
And is that what you want,
to be normal?

334
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,901
我只是不想像现在这样
I just don't wanna be what I am.

335
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,409
我有时控制不了，魔法
I can't control it sometimes,
the magic.

336
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,514
我会伤害别人
即使我不是故意的
I hurt people,
even when I don't mean to.

337
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,475
和我说说你的朋友吧
Why don't you tell me
about your friends?

338
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,456
你一定很想他们
You must miss them.

339
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,757
有个叫提姆的
There's Tim.

340
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,725
他对女巫的事一无所知
他是个普通人
He doesn't know about any
of this witch stuff. He's normal.

341
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,157
我最好的朋友莫妮克
My best friend, Monique.

342
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,402
她也是收获祭中的祭品之一
She was a part of the Harvest too.

343
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,803
她很幸运
She's lucky.

344
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,174
没人为保护我而战，却有人为她而战
No one ever fought for me,
but someone fought for her.

345
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,849
唯一一个敢于抵制收获祭仪式的
The only one who ever spoke out
against the Harvest

346
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,942
就是莫妮克的阿姨
was Monique's aunt.

347
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,609
她是谁？
And who is that?

348
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,255
苏菲德弗罗
Sophie Deveraux.

349
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,131
这个收获祭什么的，跟我多说些
So this Harvest thingy, tell me more.

350
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,500
克劳斯说要等他
Klaus said to wait.

351
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,642
对，他还说要远离河口
Yes. He also said to
stay out of the bayou,

352
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,210
但我们却在这些烦人的生物中穿梭
让人浑身发毛
and yet here we are amongst
the crawly, buzzy creatures.

353
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,605
我们到了
We're here.

354
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,092
哇
Whoa.

355
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,139
那是狼人的爪印吗？
Is that a wolf track?

356
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,109
谁在那里？
Who's there?

357
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,206
搞什么？
What the hell?

358
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,182
是真祖吗？
An Original?

359
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,780
让我消化一下
Let me understand this.

360
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,081
你和海莉没头没脑地闯进了河口
Against all logic,
you and Hayley went to the Bayou,

361
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,748
在那碰上一个可能是马赛尔线人的人
where you ran into a man you
think may be Marcel's informant,

362
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,018
然后你们却让他逃了
and then you lost him.

363
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,288
对，既然我们得出了结论
我作为妹妹、朋友
Yes, and now that we've established
that I am a failure as a sister

364
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,024
和真祖都很失败
你大概要知道
and a friend and an Original,
you should probably know

365
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,259
他正要去向马赛尔通风报信
he's on his way to Marcel
right now to rat me out.

366
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,835
骨瘦如柴，神色慌张
像见鬼了一样
Skinny guy in a hurry,
looks like he saw a ghost?

367
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:13,994
我来处理
I'll handle it.

368
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,696
但我还需要有人让马赛尔分心
But I'll need a distraction.

369
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,338
我这就来
I'm on my way.

370
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,508
又是你妹妹打的吗？
Your sister again?

371
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,444
她渴望得到关注
She craves attention.

372
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,605
我们继续聊
So, come along.

373
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,684
你快说到精彩之处了
You were just
getting to the juicy bits.

374
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,343
我不随便拿这件事开玩笑的
I can't joke around about this.

375
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,258
虽然那时我干了很多事
但我是不会对小孩下手的
I've done a lot in my day,
but I do have a rule about kids.

376
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,689
除了苏菲，从未有人质疑收获祭
No one but Sophie ever
questioned the Harvest...

377
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,591
包括我的亲生母亲
...not even my own mother.

378
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,958
所以我也没怀疑
So, neither did l.

379
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,032
我们认为这是无上光荣
We thought it was such an honor.

380
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,792
我们深信不疑
We had such faith.

381
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,402
我们太傻了
We were so stupid.

382
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,829
仪式怎么开始的？
So, how did it begin?

383
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,704
我们像公主一样被带出来
We were led out like princesses.

384
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,240
我母亲十分骄傲
My mother was so proud.

385
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:02,320
我们的法力
终将随着与祖先联系的减弱而消亡
Our magic fades as our ties
to our ancestors weaken over time.

386
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:08,090
我们恳请他们接受祭品
以示吾等之信仰
We beseech them, accept this
offering as a sign of our faith.

387
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,396
贝丝蒂娜，长老之一
召唤四大元素
Bastianna, one of the elders
called upon the four elements

388
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,862
将我们过去和未来的法力结合在一起
to bind our past and future
magic together.

389
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,297
以土连结祖先
Earth to connect us to our ancestors.

390
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,595
以水净化众女巫
Water to heal the community.

391
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,198
以风将我们送达祖先那并归来
Wind to carry us
to our ancestors and back.

392
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,445
以火涤清罪恶
Fire to purify.

393
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,920
在我们准备就绪后
我们很清楚接下来的事
After all our preparation,
we knew exactly what to expect.

394
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,152
几周以来，她们告诉我们
扎伤我们手掌的刀子
For weeks, they told us that the magic
in the knife they used to cut our palms

395
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,887
其魔法会使我们入睡
随后在收割时
would put us to sleep
and that later at the Reaping,

396
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,587
我们都将复活
we would all be resurrected.

397
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,099
她们说我们会苏醒并团聚
拥有无边法力
They said we'd awaken and all be
together and more powerful than ever.

398
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,800
就像我们排练的一样
And it was just like we rehearsed it.

399
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,136
只要扎一下我们的手掌
All that was left was just
a little cut on our palms

400
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,775
完成血祭
for the blood sacrifice.

401
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,773
不要，住手，贝丝蒂娜，住手
No! Stop! Bastianna, stop!

402
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,144
你快住手，贝丝蒂娜，别这么做
You have to stop.
Bastianna, please don't do this.

403
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,651
即便苏菲竭力阻止
我们也没有怀疑
DAVINA; Even after Sophie tried to
stop it, we didn't suspect anything.

404
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,453
如欲重生，必先牺牲
To be born, you must sacrifice.

405
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,184
你相信吗？
Do you have faith?

406
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,065
天啊
(ALL SCREAMlNG)
Oh, my God!

407
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,770
拜托不要
Please stop!

408
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:34,604
参加仪式的每个人
都知道会发生这种事
Everyone involved in the ritual
knew that this would happen.

409
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,407
除了我们四个
Except the four of us.

410
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,875
她们不是要我们入睡
她们要杀了我们
They weren't putting us to sleep.
They were slaughtering us.

411
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,585
不，不要
(SOBBlNG)
No, no!

412
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,087
莫妮克德弗罗
Monique Deveraux.

413
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,657
不要！不要！
No! No!

414
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,521
不要去，莫妮克！
Don't go, Monique!

415
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,863
我向周围的人求救
但连我的亲生母亲都置我于不顾
I begged for someone to help.
My own mother turned away from me.

416
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,091
求求你们，不要
Don't do this! Please!

417
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,829
苏菲疯狂地尖叫着，乞求她姊姊
或是任何人做点什么
Sophie screamed and screamed for
her sister, anyone to do something.

418
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,530
不要杀她
你们疯了吗？
Don't kill her!
What is wrong with you?

419
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,376
但所有人都无动于衷
But no one did.

420
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,208
但你还是活下来了
Yet you survived.

421
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,542
一定有什么阻止了事情的发生
Therefore, someone or
something intervened.

422
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,551
是的
Yes.

423
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,678
终于有人来救我们了
Someone finally did.

424
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,682
莫妮克，快跑
快跑
Monique, run away!
Run away.

425
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,296
马赛尔
Marcel!

426
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,561
是你阻止了那一切
You're the one who stopped it.

427
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,533
基兰从苏菲那得知了一切
Kieran knew every detail from Sophie.

428
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,510
自从他侄子在教堂大屠杀后
After his nephew's
massacre in the church,

429
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,047
他悲痛欲绝
他在收获祭之前离开了这里
he was so torn up,
he left town just before the Harvest,

430
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:47,073
但走之前，他来找我
要我去阻止收获祭
but on his way out, he came to me,
and he asked me to stop the Harvest.

431
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,413
他知道我不希望女巫们变得更强
He knew I didn't want the witches
getting any more power...

432
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,323
而我也最见不得欺负小孩的人
...and I do have a rule
about people abusing kids.

433
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,883
所以我照做了
但我还是迟了一步
So, I did what he asked,
but I was too late.

434
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,870
不要，莫妮克，不要
No! Monique, no!

435
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:18,079
放开我！
住手！住手！
Let go of me!
Stop it!

436
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,684
放开我！
住手！
Let go of me!
Stop it!

437
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,514
有我在
I got you.

438
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,493
看到黛维娜反抗我有种说不上来的感觉
There was something
about seeing Davina fighting.

439
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,327
她没有轻易屈服于这场屠杀，你懂吗？
She didn't just go along
to the slaughter, you know?

440
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,762
我懂
I do.

441
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,603
马赛勒斯
Marcellus.

442
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,074
我觉得我和她…
我们是同一类人
I felt like she and l,
we were kindred spirits.

443
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,834
每一个死去的女孩
会将她的力量释放到下一个女孩身上
Every girl who died,
released her power on to the next.

444
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,570
我是最后一个
所以我拥有了全部的力量
When I was the last one,
I suddenly had all of it.

445
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,442
那些力量本该被释放回大地
All the power that was supposed
to be released back into the earth

446
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,106
以安抚我们的祖先
to appease our ancestors.

447
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,616
这么说收获祭真的起作用了？
So the Harvest was actually working?

448
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,450
在某方面起作用了
我也知道我该被杀死
Something was working, and I knew
that I was supposed to be killed

449
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,923
以完成收获祭
然后我们都会再次重生
so the Harvest could be completed
and we would all be resurrected,

450
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,222
但她们隐瞒了要杀死我们的这个过程
but they lied to us about
how they were killing us.

451
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,565
我怎么知道她们说的重生是不是真的？
How do I know they weren't
lying to us about coming back?

452
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,573
最重要的是，我不想死
But mostly, I just didn't wanna die.

453
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,006
所以我让他救我
So, I let him save me.

454
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,101
马赛尔救了我一命
Marcel saved my life.

455
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,754
好一个英雄救美
You're quite the
knight in shining armor,

456
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:10,520
但黛维娜一定很清楚你欠她的
不比她欠你的少
though Davina must realize
you owe her as much as she owes you.

457
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,757
如果不是她
你不可能禁止那些女巫使用魔法
You never could have banned the
witches from using magic without her.

458
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,700
她跟女巫们的关系并不好
我是在保护她
She's not exactly besties with them.
I'm protecting her.

459
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,803
不少女巫都想找到她
A lot of them would like
to get their hands on her

460
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,495
然后杀死她好完成收获祭
and kill her to finish the Harvest.

461
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,838
如果不这样，其他女孩就不能复活
而她们将会失去自己的力量
If they don't, the other girls stay dead,
and they lose their power.

462
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,739
如果她们做到了，你将会失去你的统治
And if they do, you lose yours.

463
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,004
黛维娜也会丧命
And Davina loses her life.

464
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,944
真是往日重现啊
Isn't this like old times?

465
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,683
你们两个喝多少了？
Just how drunk are you two?

466
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,843
正在清醒的边缘挣扎着
Skating on the razor's edge.

467
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,115
我去一下洗手间
I'm gonna use the loo.

468
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,088
马上回来
Back in a tick.

469
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,322
20年代后我还没见过他醉成这样
I haven't seen him this
lushy since the twenties.

470
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,159
你是来带他回家的吗
So you came to take him home?

471
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,529
不然我为什么来这里？
Why else would I be here?

472
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,863
我不知道
I don't know.

473
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,565
或许是来确认我不会醉到
不小心说出了我们之间
Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk
and spill secrets

474
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,609
不能说的秘密
better left unspilled
about you and me.

475
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,871
我自有分寸
I know better.

476
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,014
但愿如此
I hope so.

477
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,984
因为你不会想跟我作对的
Because you don't wanna
to end up on the wrong side of me.

478
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:15,787
蕾贝卡米卡森
你也绝对不会想跟我作对的
Rebekah Mikaelson, you do not
wanna be on the wrong side of me.

479
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,859
汤玛斯，是吧？
Tomas, I presume.

480
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,667
马赛尔要我问问你
对于那些死去的巫师你都知道些什么
Marcel asked me to find out what
you know about the dead witches.

481
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,004
我听说他们是为了追杀一个怀孕的狼人
I heard they were going
after some pregnant werewolf.

482
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,339
一个女人独自跑到那种地方真是太傻了
I mean, she was stupid
being out there all alone.

483
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,208
可不是嘛，太傻了
Yeah. She was. Yeah. She is.

484
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,282
有些人真的是很家易上当
It's amazing how gullible
some people can be.

485
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,918
是啊
Yeah.

486
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,761
你可以把这个还给它真正的主人了
You may return this now
to its rightful owner.

487
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,422
已经修好了
It's restored.

488
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,105
我都不知道还会不会再见到他
I don't even know if I'll see him again.

489
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:26,124
黛维娜，你拥有的力量
是从你死去的朋友那里得来的
Davina, this power that you contain
drawn from your fallen friends,

490
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,992
超过了你的掌控能力
it's too much for you.

491
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,624
你得学会控制
那需要学习和练习
You need control which
requires study and practice.

492
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,004
我的母亲是个非常强大的女巫
And my mother was
a very powerful witch.

493
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,373
她留下了她的魔法书
留下了很多记满咒语的书
She left behind her grimoires,
a legacy of books filled with spells.

494
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,810
那些书里包含了
你可以用来控制魔法的
These books contain all of the tools
that you might need

495
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,540
各种方式
to control your magic.

496
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,819
如果你放我出去
我可以把书拿来给你
If you free me from here,
I can share them with you.

497
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,384
但如果你跟马赛尔离开了
However, if you leave now
with Marcel,

498
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,028
我们将永远见不了面
we'll never see each other again,

499
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,326
我找不到你，也就帮不了你
and I cannot find you,
and I can't help you.

500
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,636
女巫们想操纵我
The witches manipulated me.

501
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,102
你知道她们的下场
You know how that ended.

502
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,730
这不是操纵
This is not manipulation.

503
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,204
这是交换
This is one thing
in exchange for another.

504
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,383
我们来做个交易吧
I'm offering you a deal.

505
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,319
很容易的事情，蕾贝卡
That was fast work, Rebekah.

506
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,125
马赛尔去哪了？
在洗手间补妆吗？
Where's Marcel?
In there touching up his lipstick?

507
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,665
我是有品味的
Credit me with some taste.

508
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,530
那里脏得要命
It's filthy in there.

509
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,193
他去哪了？
Where'd he go?

510
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,829
他没告诉你他走了？
He didn't tell you he was leaving?

511
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,906
没有
No.

512
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,910
你觉得他发现我们在拖延他了吗？
Do you think he
realized we were stalling him?

513
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,341
不
No.

514
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,411
除非他也在拖延我们
Unless he was stalling us.

515
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,156
好了，我们的机会来了
Okay.
Now's our shot.

516
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,815
率备好走了吗？
You ready to blow this joint?

517
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,893
- 等不及了
- 那走吧
-Can't wait.
-All right.

518
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,789
把以利亚留下作为离别赠礼
We'll leave Elijah
behind as a parting gift.

519
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,232
也许他的弟弟妹妹
会因此稍微原谅我
Might buy me a little forgiveness
for pulling one over on his siblings.

520
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,169
走吧
Let's go.

521
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,918
怎么了？
What's wrong?

522
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,955
发生什么事了？
What's happening?

523
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,187
我不知道
I don't know.
(PANTlNG)

524
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,561
感觉不对劲
Something's wrong.
(SCREAMS)

525
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,635
马赛尔，外面有危险
Marcel, there's something
dangerous out there.

526
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,501
带我回去
Take me back.

527
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,980
该死
Damn it.

528
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,863
在这没人能找到你
No one's gonna look for you here.

529
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,462
只是暂时的
直到我带你出城
It's only for a little while
'til I can get you out of town

530
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,605
到安全的地方去
and someplace safe.

531
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,708
现在呢，你要什么我就帮你拿来
For now, I can get
you whatever you want.

532
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,866
你喜欢做些什么？
What do you like to do?

533
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,501
画画
Draw.

534
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,648
还是个艺术家，真不错
An artist, huh?
That's cool.

535
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,942
好的
Okay.

536
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,812
我明天去把文森那边的东西都买来给你
I can buy out Vincent's
for you tomorrow,

537
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,510
再帮你弄些窗帘过来…
maybe get you some curtains or--

538
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,314
马赛尔
Marcel.

539
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,391
你知道我真正想要什么吗？
You know what I really want?

540
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,130
我要她们得到报应
I wanna make them pay.

541
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,175
以利亚？
Elijah?

542
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,679
你能留下我很高兴
I'm pleased you stayed.

543
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,850
你说拿你母亲的魔法书给我还算数吧？
You'll keep your promise
about your mother's spell book?

544
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,248
我会拿来的
I will.

545
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,388
你知道，不管有多难
我珍视我的家人胜过一切
You know, difficulties aside,
I value my family above everything.

546
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,623
你家人辜负了你我很遗憾
I am sorry that yours failed you.

547
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,761
你弟弟克劳斯把你装进棺材
交给了马赛尔
Your brother Klaus handed
you to Marcel in a box,

548
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,459
但你依旧没放弃他
yet you still don't give up on him.

549
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,464
唉，我懒得再放弃了
Well, I've given up on giving up.

550
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,270
这很折磨人
It's an affliction.

551
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,942
我会为我的家人奋战到最后一刻
I will fight for my family
until my last breath.

552
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,214
我也会和女巫们奋战到底
And I'll fight the witches until mine.

553
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,618
现在怎样？
Now what?

554
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,125
你就这么把她留在楼上
随便谁都能找到？
You're just gonna leave her
up there for anybody to find?

555
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,819
我现在没心情，基兰
I'm not in the mood, Kieran.

556
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,659
收获祭过后你就应该带她离开纽奥良
You were supposed to get her out
of New Orleans after the Harvest.

557
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,257
我们已经失去了另外三个女孩
不能再失去她了
We failed those other three girls.
We didn't fail her.

558
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,064
正因如此我才来找你帮忙
我们计划好的
That is why I came to you for help.
That was the plan.

559
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,569
计划有变
Plans change.

560
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,368
特别是你发现她有多强大之后
Especially after you found
out how powerful she was.

561
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,739
我们把话说清楚
Let's get something straight.

562
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,041
你离开的八个月里
我把这地方治理得很好
For eight months since you left,
I've been running this town just fine.

563
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,650
我不需要你回来插手我的事
I don't need you coming back
and getting in my business.

564
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,787
我想干什么就干什么
I will do what I want where I want.

565
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:50,978
明白吗？
Got it?

566
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,183
你想做老大
You wanna be the boss?

567
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,257
想发号施令吗？
You wanna call the shots?

568
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,192
好啊，但我会联合人类一起拿回掌控权
Fine, but I call the shots
with the humans.

569
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,095
你不会想与我为敌的
And you don't wanna
make an enemy of me.

570
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,600
所以我劝你
离我侄女远点
So, I would suggest one thing,
stay away from my niece.

571
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,146
好啊，那你侄女是谁？
Fine.
Who the hell's your niece?

572
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,976
卡蜜
Cami.

573
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,131
那些人都是因为一个不知是真是假
Those people, all this because
of a vision about my baby

574
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,295
关于我孩子的幻象而死
you don't think is true.

575
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,068
听着，我爱莎宾
Look, I love Sabine,

576
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,576
但她是个非常爱小题大做的女巫
but she's the witch equivalent
of a drama queen.

577
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,911
她说的话看到的东西我都会打些折扣
I've learned to take little stock
in whatever she says or sees.

578
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,484
有时候也希望她能闭上她的嘴
Just kind of wish
she'd kept her mouth shut.

579
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,917
那个收获祭仪式
The Harvest ritual.

580
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,989
你说你不相信
You said you didn't believe in it.

581
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,858
那你猜对了吗？
Were you right?

582
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,859
没有
No.

583
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,365
我亲眼见到了
它发挥作用了
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was working.

584
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,795
那是真的
It was real.

585
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,166
那你怎么能那么肯定
莎宾看到的不是真的呢？
So how can you be so sure
Sabine's vision isn't?

586
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,683
带我外出分散我的注意力？
KLAUS: Taking me on a field trip
to distract me?

587
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,692
既可悲又明显
我可没教你这么差的伎俩
Pathetic and obvious.
I taught you better than that.

588
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,330
你教我保护自己的东西
You taught me to protect what's mine.

589
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,467
你别想把黛维娜从我身边带走，没得谈
You will not take Davina from me.
End of story.

590
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,261
自然界有条亘古不变的真理，马赛尔
An immutable law of nature, Marcel,

591
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,404
就是弱肉强食
is the strong always
take from the weak.

592
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,370
既然你那么强大
那当年你就不需要
If you were so strong, you wouldn't
have run away from New Orleans

593
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,669
狼狈地从纽奥良逃走了
Iike a little bitch
all those years ago.

594
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,681
你带着一群孩子玩游戏
扮国王扮得太久了
You've been playing king with
a bunch of children for too long.

595
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,047
别把我当成你那些夜行者随从，马赛尔
Don't mistake me for one of your
Nightwalker lackies, Marcel.

596
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,348
我随时可以把黛维娜带走
I can take Davina any time I like.

597
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,988
怎么
What the....?

598
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,188
原谅我，马赛尔
Do forgive me, Marcel.

599
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:19,166
该教训我弟弟的人，是我
But if anyone is to teach
my brother a lesson, it's me.

600
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,974
我不在乎是不是需要拿个链子把你栓住
I don't care if we
have to get you a leash.

601
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,943
你以后再也不许去河口了
That was your last trip to the bayou.

602
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,447
你跟那些狼到底是怎么回事？
What is it with you and
those wolves, anyway?

603
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,178
我觉得我们有着某种联系
I feel like we're connected somehow.

604
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,489
我也不知道
I don't know.

605
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,593
也许这只是我做的一个关于
找到我真正家人的白日梦
Maybe it's just some pipe dream
that I have of finding any real family

606
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:48,323
但当我感觉全世界都在与我为敌时
out there, but sometimes when
I feel like it's me against the world,

607
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,126
这念头就会支持我走下去
keeps me going.

608
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,031
忘记了
Oh, right.

609
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,166
好吧，如果你问我
家人就如芒刺在背
Well, if you ask me,
family is a pain in the behind.

610
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,339
至于你说的全世界都与你为敌
你怎么能这么说？
And as for being in it alone,
how dare you?

611
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,843
我可不会随随便便为了任何人
I don't ruin a perfectly
fabulous pair of boots

612
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,044
在河口闲逛毁掉我一双好靴子
traipsing through the Bayou
for just anyone.

613
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,094
尼克，总算回来了，你到底…
Nik. Finally. What....?

614
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,696
以利亚
Elijah.

615
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,099
你没事
You're safe.

616
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,650
既然你回家了
第一件事是不是要杀了尼克劳斯？
Now that you're home,
is your first plan to kill Niklaus?

617
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,517
抱歉，稍等我一下
Excuse me, just a moment.

618
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,026
他去哪？
Where's he going?

619
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,085
你回来了
You're back.

620
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,985
我回来了
I'm back.

621
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,201
守不住的承诺就别说
Don't make promises you can't keep.

622
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,304
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

623
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,074
我们回到纽奥良的原因
现在看来是个谎言
ELlJAH: Everything that brought
us here to New Orleans was a lie.

624
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,813
苏菲德弗罗捏造了一个
This story that
Sophie Deveraux fabricated,

625
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,821
争夺法语区控制权的故事
this struggle for
control of the French Quarter,

626
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,016
吸血鬼与女巫间的战争
this war between
vampires and witches,

627
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,060
不在于争夺领地
而在于争夺黛维娜
wasn't over territory at all.
This was over Davina.

628
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,724
我发誓我不知道收获祭仪式是真的
I swear I had no idea that the
Harvest could possibly be real.

629
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,234
但你却那么确定我是错的
But the one thing that you were sure of
is that I was wrong and that

630
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,206
我会拿莫妮克的生命开玩笑
现在我的女儿死了
I would risk Monique's life on a
maybe, and now my daughter is dead.

631
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,074
请告诉我我该怎么补救
Please tell me how to fix this.

632
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:21,610
现在黛维娜在马赛尔手里
我们要怎么做才能找到她呢？
Now that Marcel has Davina,
how are we even supposed to find her?

633
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,344
如果我们不完成仪式
If we don't finish the Harvest,

634
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,218
莫妮克和另外两个女孩就会真的死了
Monique and those two other girls
are dead for real.

635
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,227
看着我
Look at me.

636
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,924
我们会找到方法让莫妮克复活的
You and I are gonna find
a way to get Monique back.

637
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,103
这是我们的秘密
It'll be our little secret.

638
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,431
我们一起去完成
We'll do it together.

639
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,668
我们把墓地封锁起来，不让吸血鬼靠近
We'll seal off the cemetery
from the vampires,

640
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,903
找到黛维娜，阻止马赛尔
然后完成仪式
find Davina, stop Marcel, and finish
the ritual once and for all.

641
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,245
哪怕我要亲自割破黛维娜的喉咙
Even if I have to slit
Davina's throat myself.

642
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:02,824
八个月前，苏菲德弗罗
和她姊姊简安失去了一切
Eight months ago, Sophie Deveraux and
her sister Jane-Anne lost everything.

643
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,495
四个月之后，一个年轻的孕妇
Now, four months after that,
a young, pregnant girl

644
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,131
走进了她们的餐厅
wanders into their restaurant.

645
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,460
突然间，她们重新燃起了希望
Suddenly, all hope is renewed.

646
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,262
简安真的牺牲了自己的性命
好让她妹妹
Jane-Anne actually sacrificed
her life so that her sister

647
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,962
利用你找回黛维娜
could use you to find Davina.

648
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,007
如果苏菲德弗罗成功找到了黛维娜
If Sophie Deveraux is
successful in capturing Davina,

649
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,237
她就可以让简安的女儿复活
she can return
Jane-Anne's daughter back to life.

650
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,974
我们以为我们是来进行一场权力的战争
We thought we'd come here
to wage a war for power.

651
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,549
但其实这是一场关于家人的战争
This is about family.

652
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,711
为了让她的侄女复活
In order to return her niece to life,

653
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,823
苏菲德弗罗一定会奋战到最后一刻
Sophie Deveraux will fight
to the death.

654
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,852
因此她比任何人都危险
That makes her more
dangerous than anyone.

655
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,328
（简安德弗罗）

656
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:54,703
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
