1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,330
<i>I wanna take another look. Anyone object?</i>

2
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,131
<i>No, go ahead. Be my guest.</i>

3
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,691
- I've never seen that much money.
- Mercy.

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,328
Look at that. That is awesome.

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:18,450
- How much do you think there is?
- I don't know. Thousands.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,602
All right.

7
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,884
I still say we should take it to the police.

8
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:26,602
Hold on, all right. Just hear me out, okay?
One of us holds it.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,604
We check in, say, I don't know, 30 days...

10
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:32,049
if nobody's reported it missing,
then we split it between us.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,243
Yeah. All right. Okay.

12
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,930
So, who holds it?

13
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,884
- I wouldn't mind.
- No.

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,721
No, 'cause I don't know you,
and I don't know him.

15
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,804
How am I supposed to know
you won't disappear?

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,849
Yeah, he has got a point.

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,289
What about if our man here,
he looks after it?

18
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:01,171
But to prove he's not a thief,
I'm not saying that you are...

19
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,971
he goes to the bank. This is brilliant.

20
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,202
Take out... What you got?

21
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,011
I've got £6,000 in the building society.

22
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,802
You've got £6,000, okay. Takes out £6,000.
Gives us £3,000 each.

23
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,645
- But I keep the case?
- Obviously.

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,052
I ain't got a problem with that.

25
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:17,012
If you don't hear anything in a month,
we'll come back. Split the money.

26
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,728
- Okay.
- Yeah? Okay. Let's do it.

27
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:24,043
Man, we're gonna be so rich.
I can't believe it.

28
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,647
I came out this morning,
I had 20 quid in my pocket.

29
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,487
Now, I'm looking at
a third share in £25,000.

30
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:33,565
It's like it just came out of the sky
and we just found it there.

31
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,689
Brought from heaven, or something.

32
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,565
How's it going, Danny?

33
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,163
- What?
- The score.

34
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,004
How do you think it's going
on a scale of 1 to 10?

35
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,682
A nine maybe?

36
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,246
Nine-ish.

37
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,333
- No?
- Ask your question.

38
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:02,446
How do you know
how much is in the case?

39
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,851
We didn't count it yet?

40
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,162
Shit.

41
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:26,411
- What happened?
- He did. Come on.

42
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,442
First rule of cheating at cards:

43
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,969
Always cover the move.

44
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,688
Misdirection.
Big movement covers the small.

45
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,722
Simple stuff.

46
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:18,924
And, if you can, always sit by the door.

47
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,446
- Look, Mick.
- Forget it.

48
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,650
No, I don't want to forget it. All right?
Okay, I screwed up.

49
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,122
Yeah, what did you learn? In a sentence.

50
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,932
Do it by the book.

51
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,248
This way.

52
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,689
You screw up again, Danny,
I'll have it tattooed on your ass.

53
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:53,364
- So who's this Frank Gorley?
- Beelzebub.

54
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,967
I say we give him a taste
of his own medicine.

55
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,322
I know some people.

56
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,166
I can personally vouch for
how many places they can hurt you.

57
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,131
- That's not what we do.
- What are we gonna do, then?

58
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:06,562
Ash?

59
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,727
He runs a hotel and casino
in the West End.

60
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,721
<i>The casino's bent.</i>

61
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,771
<i>He ships in girls from Eastern Europe</i>
<i>for the hotel.</i>

62
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:32,089
<i>Punters lose their money on the tables,</i>
<i>then curl up with Hilda from Hungary.</i>

63
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,447
<i>Not the sort of man</i>
<i>you take liberties with.</i>

64
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:45,292
<i>In fact, if we had a list of places</i>
<i>not to go...</i>

65
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:49,529
he'd be right there at the top.

66
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,761
Find me an in.

67
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:10,242
The usual.

68
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,088
I was one card short of a great hand.

69
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,489
Maybe I should put you on a curfew.

70
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,969
I'd like to see you try.

71
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:02,722
- You're not 20 years old anymore, Albert.
- Yes, I am.

72
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:06,643
Up here, where it counts.

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,802
- You are setting a very bad example.
- Good.

74
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:16,605
I hear you're giving young Danny
a hard time.

75
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,722
He screwed up.

76
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,607
We all screw up.

77
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:25,563
- It's what you do next that counts.
- Maybe.

78
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,851
He's got grift sense. You can't teach that.

79
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,212
And I'm not gonna be around forever,
so you'll need him.

80
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:40,412
Let me worry about Danny.
You just get some rest.

81
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,165
We'll call back later.

82
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,363
Is there anything you want, Albie?

83
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:53,688
Three nurses and a deck of cards.

84
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,133
We'll meet Ash back at the hotel.
See what he's got.

85
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,248
Wait.

86
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:11,922
Call me.

87
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,166
- Peter?
- Yes?

88
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,084
Maureen Phillips, media services.

89
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,609
- Media?
- Sorry. Hello.

90
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,846
I'm already on it.

91
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,448
Please tell the Minister it's all in hand.
He has nothing to worry about.

92
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,932
I'm with Peter now.

93
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,328
Yeah.

94
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:40,291
I'll call you as soon as I'm on my way back.
Okay.

95
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,686
Sorry about that.
You know what politicians are like.

96
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,922
Yes.

97
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,651
The thing is, we've been tipped off...

98
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,328
that the press are conducting
an investigation into NHS Trust services.

99
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:53,405
- And this hospital's been earmarked.
- I see.

100
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:57,247
They select a patient and follow
his progress through the system...

101
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,164
debriefing him as and when he leaves.

102
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,005
Well, the thing is...

103
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,402
The patient they've selected
is an elderly man...

104
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:07,168
called Albert Stroller?

105
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,163
God, I can just see the headlines now.

106
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,483
Right, look, I'll get onto it...

107
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:15,212
Find him, Peter, treat him like a prince.

108
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,964
We're all in your hands, now.

109
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,007
Thank you.

110
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,204
If ever we needed Albert...

111
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,410
If there is an in, I can't find it.

112
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:58,053
Well, look, we know he plays cards.

113
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:00,323
We also know he can spot a cheat.

114
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,688
Women?

115
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:05,129
He's got two dozen hookers on tap, 2<i>4/</i>7,
but doesn't go near them.

116
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:08,205
I spoke to one of the croupiers
at the casino. The guy's a loner.

117
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,124
He locks himself in his room every night.

118
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,487
- No friends?
- No, nothing.

119
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,086
- Stocks, shares?
- Doesn't trust them.

120
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,164
Dabbled once, lost heavily.
Vowed never again.

121
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,403
The man's a block of ice.
He calculates the odds.

122
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,324
He never goes out on a limb.

123
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,165
The only thing he's passionate about,
as far as I can see, is extreme violence.

124
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,529
There is one thing.

125
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,882
He carries a laptop wherever he goes.

126
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:36,532
If he has got a weakness,
that's where we'll find it.

127
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,848
<i>Good, it'll give Danny a chance</i>
<i>to show us how much he's learned.</i>

128
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,807
How we doing?

129
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,563
Depends how much we spend
on the set up.

130
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,372
Whatever it takes.
He put his hands on Albert.

131
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,008
But I thought the book says,
"Never let your heart rule your head."

132
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,288
Hello?

133
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:19,167
Your wife.

134
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,331
I don't think it works.

135
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,122
What?

136
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,443
Downloading from the hard disk
telepathically.

137
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:45,764
- I'm thinking.
- But they're on dessert.

138
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,687
Divide and conquer.

139
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,603
Excuse me, you dropped a fork there.

140
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,728
Having fun?

141
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,331
That's a natural laxative.

142
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:34,651
- What? Eye drops?
- Yeah, just watch.

143
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:14,649
- I thought you couldn't stand this place.
- I can't.

144
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,929
Then it must be important.

145
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,808
Did Stacie tell you I came to see you?

146
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,721
- Why wouldn't she?
- You didn't call.

147
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:28,041
I've been busy.

148
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,407
- You look well.
- I am.

149
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:38,290
- Thanks for the letters.
- I had nothing to say.

150
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:50,811
I want a divorce. Nothing else.

151
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:55,609
The forms just need a signature.
I even put a stamp on for you.

152
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,889
Simon and I want to get married.

153
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,642
Well?

154
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:10,083
I've gone from soul mate to obstacle
so fast, I think I'm gonna get a nosebleed.

155
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,403
You always loved this more than me.

156
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,363
Everything you ever dreamed of, is he?

157
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,331
Just sign the papers, Mick.

158
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,206
Two minutes.

159
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,166
What are you doing?

160
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:41,602
Come on.

161
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,007
Nearly there.

162
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,567
Come on!

163
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,442
Got it, Dan.

164
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,967
Well, now.

165
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:28,370
<i>- It was there all the time.</i>
- The usual.

166
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,886
<i>I just didn't see it.</i>

167
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,411
This guy is crazy about the movies.

168
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:44,646
The guy's a romantic,
so strictly black and white.

169
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,852
Then Stacie needs to be classier than Diaz.

170
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:50,925
Someone classic, like Hepburn.

171
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,042
Got it.

172
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:56,647
Mickey.

173
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,650
Listen, we talked about me moving up.

174
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,772
- Working the inside on the next big score.
- That was before you screwed up.

175
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,726
Yeah, exactly.

176
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:13,407
We need to get the lads down to Eddie's.
We're putting a team together for Albert.

177
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,609
You shouldn't take it out on Danny.

178
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,052
Pete will be great. What about Sam?
Is he free?

179
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,571
Give him a call for me, would you?

180
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,008
Any other names you can mention
who might be about?

181
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,324
Danny, knock yourself out.

182
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:45,011
Thanks, Andy.
Albert will really appreciate it.

183
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:49,685
- Sam.
- Miss Monroe.

184
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:53,288
- You might need to shave, Sam.
- For Albert? Sure.

185
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,206
- Hi, trinkle.
- Hello, Pete.

186
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,046
- How you doing?
- I'm here for Albert, all right?

187
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,128
Maritime Pictures? Hello, there.

188
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,603
I have a meeting with your financial
director there later this week.

189
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,127
I was wondering,
could you fax me directions?

190
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,722
Yeah, lovely. Thanks very much. Bye-bye.

191
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:41,282
Okay.

192
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:46,649
Right. We've booked you into a room
at Gorley's hotel...

193
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,408
<i>and there are faxes waiting for you</i>
<i>from every major Hollywood studio.</i>

194
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,324
<i>We know he keeps tabs on all his guests...</i>

195
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:56,531
<i>and won't pass up the opportunity</i>
<i>to meet a big shot movie mogul like you.</i>

196
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:00,767
- You ready?
- Yeah.

197
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,452
By the book, Danny.

198
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,925
I don't know any other way.

199
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,889
Look into his eyes, and think as he thinks.

200
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,042
For Albert.

201
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:16,922
Okay.

202
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:30,004
Good morning.
Could I interest you in a special discount?

203
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:33,207
Good morning.

204
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,611
Hello. Could I interest you
in a special discount?

205
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,291
I want a divorce.

206
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,328
- We're all set.
- Right.

207
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,011
Well, this is a whole new side of you
I haven't seen before.

208
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:23,568
- What?
- Suffering in silence.

209
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:25,769
What makes you think I'm suffering?

210
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,083
Mr. Happy left town days ago.

211
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:33,968
- Thanks for what you're doing for Danny.
- Why the sudden interest?

212
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,772
- Albie told me to look out for him.
- Albie.

213
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:39,048
Is there anything
Albert hasn't taken care of?

214
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,122
No.

215
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:45,009
Listen, if the strong silent thing
stops working for you...

216
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:47,607
- and you need somebody to talk to...
- Yeah.

217
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:58,407
It's Rachel.

218
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,842
- She wants a divorce.
- And?

219
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,686
- And that's it.
- So you agreed?

220
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:10,690
I told her I'd think about it.

221
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,770
- What? No lecture?
- You've got all this talent.

222
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:22,046
You can bend people to your will.
Make them do what you want them to.

223
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,683
If you set your mind to it...

224
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:27,651
you can convince her in a week
to take you back.

225
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,205
- So why don't you?
- You think I should con Rachel back?

226
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,768
That's what we do isn't it, Mickey?

227
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:36,362
Create a world the way we want it to be?

228
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:39,851
You convince her that you can be
the man she wants.

229
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,611
Problem is,
you gotta convince yourself first.

230
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,850
So, let's go get this bastard.

231
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,122
<i>House & Garden,</i> please.

232
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:09,687
<i>Movie News.</i>

233
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,172
Mr. Harris,
I'm from the hospital administration.

234
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,051
We need to talk about how you'd like
to settle your account.

235
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,806
I wish you lot would talk to each other.
You're a mess.

236
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:46,363
- I'm sorry?
- I've already settled my account. Cash.

237
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,010
The special discount.

238
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,292
- We've had some faxes for you, Mr. Elliott.
- Yeah?

239
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,568
These movie studios.
They never leave me alone.

240
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:38,972
Wanna do me a favor, sweetheart?

241
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,408
Send me up some mineral water
and some fresh fruit.

242
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:42,721
Of course, sir.

243
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,771
The car's outside.

244
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:49,526
I'll see to it,
and I hope you enjoy your stay.

245
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:52,730
Yeah, I'm sure I will. Thank you.

246
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,212
By the book, Danny.

247
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,891
Jason Elliott.

248
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,526
- So you're in the film business?
- So they tell me.

249
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,929
You like the movies, Frank?

250
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,172
Since I was a kid.

251
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:29,603
They don't make them like they used to.

252
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:32,571
So, what is it you do exactly?

253
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:36,129
I find the money
that makes the magic happen.

254
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:42,485
You ever thought of putting money
into films, Frank?

255
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:45,970
- I like my money where it is.
- And where is that?

256
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,286
Where I can see it.

257
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,285
- Would you excuse me?
- Sure.

258
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,047
Hey, Frank.

259
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,331
I'm wining and dining
a couple of investors later.

260
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:02,605
Might be nice to round the night off here,
if that's okay?

261
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,322
- No problem.
- Thanks, Frank, I appreciate that.

262
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:28,487
Danny thinks we need £20,000
for the convincer.

263
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,251
How much are we short?

264
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:33,650
If we can get £5,000 from Gorley up front,
we can scrape £16,000.

265
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:37,487
I'm telling you, Gorley's got trouble
written all over him.

266
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,527
I just don't want to get in there
and be half-cocked.

267
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:41,602
So the question is:

268
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,686
Where are we going to find a sucker
with £<i>4</i>,000 at this time of the night?

269
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:49,006
What? No.

270
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:53,287
Come on, Eddie. It's better than the banks.
A 50% Return in three days.

271
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:54,768
No.

272
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:55,968
- It's for Albert.
- No.

273
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:58,169
- Will you stop saying "no"?
- No.

274
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:02,164
Albert told me that if I ever thought
I was talking to a con man...

275
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,481
just keep saying no.

276
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,963
We're not trying to con you, Eddie,
we're asking for your help.

277
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:13,217
- Three days?
- Tops.

278
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,693
- For Albert?
- Absolutely.

279
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:19,656
If I don't get paid back, you're all barred.

280
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,016
Good seeing you.

281
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,376
- How you doing?
- Okay.

282
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,056
- What are we doing here?
- Come on, just relax.

283
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,814
Frank, this is Jeff Machin.

284
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:39,735
Jeff, this is Frank Gorley.
He owns this place.

285
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,979
Arrogant asshole.

286
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,980
- What's his problem?
- You tell me.

287
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,896
I made the guy $3 million last year...

288
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:53,337
he treats me like the hired help.

289
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,891
Excuse me, Frank.

290
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:59,736
- These bastards are cheating on me.
- Joe, just calm down, okay?

291
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,050
Let's get you a coffee.

292
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:05,579
I don't want a coffee, I want another drink.
You cheating bastards!

293
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,058
I'm sorry, Frank. It's okay.

294
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:11,576
- Your friend needs a lesson in manners.
- I know.

295
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,222
You got somebody who can maybe
run him home?

296
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,211
What?

297
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:23,774
Joe might not like to lose his money,
but he's got very powerful connections.

298
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,060
He's a personal friend of Sly Stallone.

299
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,214
And I promised that I'd keep
an eye on him.

300
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:32,982
He knows Sly Stallone?

301
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:37,934
Well, it's not so much Sly,
it's more his mother.

302
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:41,779
- I could buy this place.
- He's staying at the Grovesnor.

303
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,219
Close it down, turn it into a shithole.

304
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:52,821
I'm sorry, Frank. I gotta talk to Jeff.

305
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:54,779
You got anywhere quiet?

306
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,453
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

307
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:04,133
He's a drunk.
I don't want to work with him.

308
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:05,257
Come on, Joe's okay.

309
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:07,572
If he's in this time, then count me out.

310
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:10,495
- I gave you my word.
- Then screw him and screw you.

311
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:14,451
The people you do business with
have got a really bad attitude problem.

312
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,611
You know that?

313
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:16,691
Do me a favor, pal?

314
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,977
Keep your nose out
of what doesn't concern you.

315
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,893
Okay, that's enough.

316
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:23,371
You want to watch your mouth, boy.

317
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:26,852
I'm sorry, Frank,
Jeff's just wound up about Joe.

318
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:31,095
Okay, look. All right. He's out.

319
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,373
I'll get somebody else to cover his end.

320
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:35,373
Now, this is Frank's office...

321
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,218
a bit of respect wouldn't go amiss.

322
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:41,375
- You found a buyer yet?
- It's all in place.

323
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:44,181
We buy in at £15,000, we get back £60,000.

324
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:45,981
That's film extras.

325
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,533
In all the casting agencies,
they try and strike up an exclusive...

326
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,340
with any movie with a decent budget.

327
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:53,572
It's small potatoes in
the grand scheme of things...

328
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:55,573
but, hey, every little counts, right?

329
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,095
Except we just lost Joe.

330
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:58,934
- I said, I'd take care of it.
- How?

331
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,616
This is a cash deal. We meet
the producer at breakfast...

332
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,454
before the banks open.

333
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:07,335
You know what?

334
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:10,892
Screw the deal, I'm glad Joe's out of it.

335
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:14,498
The guy's only interested
in the bottom line. He's got no soul.

336
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:18,259
You know what his favorite film is,
Frank? <i>Rambo.</i>

337
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,617
How are you gonna do business
with a guy like that?

338
00:31:20,702 --> 00:31:24,456
- Bogart, Cagney, now they made movies.
- You like Cagney?

339
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,453
No one like him, before or since.

340
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,941
- Best film?
<i>- White Heat.</i>

341
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,614
- "Made it, Ma."
- "Top of the world."

342
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:32,774
Good film, but not his best.
Do you know he was a dancer?

343
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:34,978
- Came up through vaudeville?
- That's right.

344
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,496
Best song and dance man in the business.

345
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,655
When you two have finished,
can we get back to the job in hand?

346
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,211
Yeah.

347
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,574
So what is this deal exactly?

348
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,574
The deal is with the producer,
for the extras contract.

349
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:53,176
We meet him, pay him off,
then go to the set...

350
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,492
and collect from the guy from the agency.

351
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,413
- A film set?
- Yeah.

352
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:01,217
Trouble is, like Jeff says, we lost Joe
so we're £5,000 light.

353
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,852
Let me get this straight.

354
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:06,857
You take this producer £15,000...

355
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:10,651
then you drive over to the film set
and collect £60,000?

356
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:13,098
That's about the strength of it.

357
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:16,699
So what if I put up the £5,000 you're light?

358
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:21,173
So long as I pick up his share,
this guy Joe's share, in return.

359
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,578
- No way.
- I wasn't talking to you.

360
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:25,061
You gonna let this guy muscle in?

361
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:28,691
All he'd be doing is taking over
Joe's share. What difference does it make?

362
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,101
I don't even know this guy.

363
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,935
For God's sake, the lame brain's
gonna give us a check now.

364
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:36,981
- Jeff, come on, please. Just relax.
- All right.

365
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:40,220
It does have to be cash, Frank. I'm sorry.

366
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,616
You gonna be polite?

367
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,377
Frank helped us out with Joe.
Cutting him in is the least we can do.

368
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:06,291
Thanks, Frank.

369
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:10,375
Like I said, I like my money
where I can see it.

370
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,775
I'm coming with you.

371
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:15,291
All right.

372
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:09,055
I'll call.

373
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,341
Three sevens.

374
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,051
Flush.

375
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:29,531
Again.

376
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,897
- Pete.
- You took your time.

377
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,495
Nice to see you, too.

378
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:58,131
The money's in the one with the flap open,
so give that one to Danny first.

379
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,974
- How long?
- Any minute now.

380
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:01,734
Just be out of sight.

381
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,973
I've told you, Lucy,
either the line goes or I do.

382
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,737
Well, Jesus Christ! Go and tell them.

383
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,532
- Jenny baby.
- Jason.

384
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:30,897
How's it going?

385
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:33,416
The director's a moron.
Can't you fire him for me?

386
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:36,380
Baby, I could, but he'd sue my ass off.

387
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,893
This is a very good friend of mine.
This is Frank Gorley.

388
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,973
- Glad to meet you, Frank.
- How do you do?

389
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:44,781
Okay, come on, now. Back to work.
Time is money.

390
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:46,859
He's such a slave driver.

391
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,177
- That's Jenny Cole?
- You know her?

392
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,459
- I was reading about her this morning.
- She's gonna be huge.

393
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,772
They're calling her
the new Audrey Hepburn.

394
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,932
- Jason.
- How you doing?

395
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:00,900
Okay. We still on?

396
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,131
It's a done deal.

397
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:05,897
Great, I've got 200 wannabe starlets
waiting for the nod, here.

398
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:09,299
- You fellas wanna help me pick?
- No, we'll leave that, all right?

399
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:12,180
You gonna talk all day
or you gonna give me my money?

400
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:16,695
Split three ways, just like he said.

401
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:18,500
That's beautiful.

402
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:26,098
£20,000. Not a bad return for half an hour,
is it?

403
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:31,618
- Looks like Joe's loss is my gain.
- I guess so.

404
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:38,853
While we're here, any chance of walking
around the set, watching a bit of filming?

405
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,413
Frank, I gotta get back.
Square things up with Joe.

406
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,973
I thought Joe was out of the picture.

407
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,132
He is for this but not the big one.

408
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:51,982
- Big one?
- Shut your mouth, Jason.

409
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,976
- Did I say anything?
- Just get in the car.

410
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:02,173
Anybody asks for me,
tell them I left five minutes ago.

411
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:32,774
So where's my £<i>4</i>,000?

412
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:34,575
We just gave it away.

413
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:40,051
Hi, Eddie.

414
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,896
- Did you just give my money away?
- It's all right.

415
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:46,334
- It was bait.
- Bait?

416
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:50,137
So did we get the green light?

417
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:53,219
We tell him the tale tonight.

418
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:06,611
- Here he is. Frank. How are you doing?
- Okay.

419
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,454
- You remember Jenny?
- Of course.

420
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:11,215
She wrapped late today.
She wants a little bit of R and R.

421
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:13,372
Excuse me. Are you Jennifer Cole?

422
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:16,775
Have you got a pen?

423
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:22,576
Thank you.

424
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:26,377
Can you get someone to watch over Jen
while she plays the tables?

425
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:27,651
No problem.

426
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:31,898
See Miss Cole isn't bothered.

427
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:34,457
- Go have fun.
- Thank you, Frank.

428
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:39,216
- Can we get a drink?
- Yeah.

429
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,459
How did it go with Joe?

430
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:44,935
- The guy's a fruit loop.
- I told you that six months ago.

431
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,138
It's a shame, I kind of liked him,
you know?

432
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:49,531
- But this is business.
- Yeah.

433
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:52,979
So what about the big one?

434
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:59,091
- You mentioned it earlier.
- Jeff?

435
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:03,261
Okay, Frank, sit down.

436
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,331
Tell him.

437
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:11,013
We're gonna make a movie.
Kind of low budget. Say about £5,000,000.

438
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:14,857
Jenny thinks it's her big break
in the States...

439
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:18,571
but where we're really
gonna make our money is in Asia.

440
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:20,211
Asia?

441
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:24,098
- Can I be frank, Frank?
- Please.

442
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,174
While everyone else is looking at
the home market...

443
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:31,172
we sell the video rights to Asia up front.

444
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,499
We can virtually name our price.

445
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,972
I figure we're gonna get £10 million
without breaking a sweat.

446
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:44,012
- And she's agreed to do it?
- She signed the contract yesterday.

447
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,021
So is Joe in or out?

448
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:49,220
He still wants in, but you know what
these Mob guys are like.

449
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:50,781
They're a liability.

450
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:52,574
Bottom line is, Frank:

451
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:56,098
If you want a slice of the cake,
I can make it happen.

452
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,533
How much are we talking about?

453
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:03,699
It's gonna be the same as me and Jeff
are in for.

454
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:05,819
That's 200 big ones.

455
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,181
£200,000?

456
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,660
With a guarantee...

457
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,417
that you're gonna get
double your money back in three months.

458
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:20,937
No, I think I'll pass.

459
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:22,891
What?

460
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:26,493
I'm £15,000 up.
I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.

461
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:29,858
- What if we...
- We can find someone else.

462
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:32,178
It's not a problem, okay?

463
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:36,052
- How about that drink?
- Sure.

464
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,893
You've got to pick it up, Dan.

465
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,934
You're talking to this guy about money.

466
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:56,661
He's surrounded by money,
he's not fazed by it.

467
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,336
You're offering him something
he's already got.

468
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:02,220
You've gotta think about what brought us
this far.

469
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:07,258
What can you give him that he can't get
anywhere else?

470
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:11,981
Don't talk to his head, talk to his heart.
Emotion not reason.

471
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:16,857
Think.

472
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,372
<i>- You like the movies, Frank?</i>
<i>- Since I was a kid.</i>

473
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:26,612
<i>- You like Cagney?</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

474
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,091
<i>Best song and dance man in the business.</i>

475
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,535
<i>You like Cagney?</i>

476
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:51,891
- What do you say, Frank?
- Count me in.

477
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:12,974
- Bankers draft.
- Thanks, Frank.

478
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:14,780
Now that's beautiful.

479
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:19,573
There's a receipt for £200,000
and a copy of the contract.

480
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:22,251
We're all going to make a lot of money.

481
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:24,371
We'd better.

482
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:30,093
- Top of the world.
- Top of the world, Frank.

483
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,813
You're not gonna join us, baby?

484
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:36,372
I'm trying to get my head around
this damn script.

485
00:43:36,462 --> 00:43:38,498
Do you want me to
run some lines with you?

486
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,617
Would you mind?

487
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,658
I tell you what.
Why doesn't Frank help you?

488
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:44,302
Get him in the swing of things. Frank?

489
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:46,691
Me?

490
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:49,501
Come on. You just gotta read through
the script with Jen.

491
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:52,460
You're gonna be great. Come on.

492
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,011
Go ahead.

493
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:03,418
- I've never done this sort of thing before.
- Don't worry you'll be fine.

494
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,734
Thank you, Frank.

495
00:44:27,942 --> 00:44:29,011
Thank you.

496
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:32,980
Check's cleared.

497
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:36,094
It's being transferred now.

498
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:38,616
Time to make sure he won't come after us.

499
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,898
Then we blow him out tonight.

500
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:42,901
You ready?

501
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:47,011
Yeah.

502
00:44:57,182 --> 00:44:59,412
Do you think he's gonna be all right?

503
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:01,971
If he does as he's told, he'll be fine.

504
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:06,411
You have to be face-on to Mickey when
he shoots or the signal might not work.

505
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:09,460
If it doesn't work, when you go down
fall on your chest.

506
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,817
The force should split the bag, all right?

507
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:14,416
Danny, no theatrics, okay?

508
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:17,255
One shot and you go down
like a sack of potatoes.

509
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:21,136
- By the book.
- By the book.

510
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:23,815
We're done.

511
00:45:31,222 --> 00:45:34,419
Okay, we start shooting next month.

512
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:37,017
Jason is talking to directors all week.

513
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:40,100
I hope he's getting someone better
than the last one.

514
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:42,658
Where is Jason?
He should be here by now.

515
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:46,291
Relax, Frank, he's just crossing the "T's"...

516
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:47,656
Hey, Jason.

517
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,259
- Jason?
- We're screwed.

518
00:45:57,742 --> 00:46:00,779
- What?
- Joe's gone.

519
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:07,299
- He checked out of the hotel first thing.
- So what's the problem?

520
00:46:07,582 --> 00:46:09,254
He wasn't in the picture anyway.

521
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:13,460
He was co-signature at the bank.
I didn't have time to change it.

522
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,132
He cleaned us out before he left.

523
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,380
Cleaned us out how? Of what?

524
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:23,455
Everything, all right. It's all gone!
Every penny!

525
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:27,856
- God, I had £200,000 in there!
- Well, we all did!

526
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,777
You mean, he took all the money?

527
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,375
He took my money, too.

528
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:34,612
I gave that money to you, you little shit.

529
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:36,932
Well, I'm telling you, it's all gone!

530
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:38,933
- Go get it back!
- I can't!

531
00:46:41,062 --> 00:46:44,054
He figures we welched on him first
when we cut him out.

532
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:46,781
Let me know where he is
and I'll get it back.

533
00:46:47,462 --> 00:46:50,340
You can't, none of us can.

534
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,336
He's connected.

535
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:58,253
- I want my money back.
- Don't be stupid, Jeff.

536
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:01,337
Come on, man. I'm telling you.

537
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:05,734
I'm telling you, man, he's taken all of it!
There's nothing left!

538
00:47:09,382 --> 00:47:11,816
- Frank.
- You dirty rat!

539
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:25,050
- Get me out of here, Frank.
- Get her out!

540
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,098
Frank, please. The press.

541
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:30,857
- He lost my money!
- Please, Frank. Help me!

542
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:33,740
Get her out. It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Go.

543
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:43,340
Come on. Don't die on me.

544
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:48,057
Come on, Danny. You're gonna be all right.

545
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:56,176
How's he doing?

546
00:47:56,302 --> 00:47:59,021
They're operating on him now.
What about Gorley?

547
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:03,892
He's laying low. He thinks he killed Danny,
so he'll stay that way.

548
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:05,011
Good.

549
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:08,502
- Police?
- I told them we found him like that.

550
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:11,813
He was there for a big game
and got robbed for his stash.

551
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:13,977
Did they buy it?

552
00:48:14,062 --> 00:48:16,974
There were no other witnesses,
so they had no choice.

553
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:24,336
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

554
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:27,217
You were right. He wasn't ready.

555
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:29,532
Yes, he was. He did good.

556
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:44,935
He's gonna be okay.

557
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:17,298
£3,900. £<i>4</i>,000.

558
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:21,494
- What?
- Interest?

559
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:32,658
- I thought you'd forgotten me.
- No.

560
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:36,414
- How do you feel?
- Like I've been shot.

561
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:40,814
The doctor says you should be
up and about in no time.

562
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:44,736
We've got Albie's present,
you want to come?

563
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,850
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

564
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:52,694
Your carriage awaits, sir.

565
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:56,895
- You know how I hate surprises.
- You'll like this one.

566
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:02,741
Just look at you two.

567
00:50:02,822 --> 00:50:05,336
I should start taking out
medical insurance.

568
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,135
First, there's this.

569
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:10,853
Well, that's a lot of money.

570
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:13,701
And now, for the cherry on top.

571
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:21,696
<i>Look, Albert...</i>

572
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:26,092
<i>there's no way I can apologize enough.</i>

573
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:30,181
<i>The truth is, I'm an idiot.</i>

574
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,257
<i>I'm not fit to lace your boots.</i>

575
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:36,972
<i>I'm the shit on your shoes...</i>

576
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:41,172
<i>and I don't deserve your forgiveness.</i>

577
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:43,501
<i>But I'm begging you.</i>

578
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:50,577
<i>Forgive me.</i>

579
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:00,578
<i>Thank you, Frank. So sweet of you</i>
<i>to run those lines with me.</i>

580
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:09,534
Now that's show biz.

581
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,371
English
