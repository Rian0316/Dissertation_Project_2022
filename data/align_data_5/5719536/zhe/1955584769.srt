《絕命律師》前情提要
Previously on AMC's "Better Call Saul"...

你剛剛承認犯了一項重罪你知道吧
You do realize you just confessed to a felony?

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,070
你就為了這個  毀了我們的家
For this, you destroyed our family?

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,170
你現在滿意了嗎
You happy now?!

他把我困住了
He's got me boxed in.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,800
你可以放手一搏
You can fight this.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,610
我非常懊悔  后悔到你完全無法想象
I regret it all, more than you can imagine,

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,900
因為你是我的哥哥
'cause you're my brother.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,570
我會提交對錄音的查禁請求
I'm filing a motion to suppress that tape.

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,120
撇開動議  那盤錄音帶會被播放的
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,260
怎么樣

不  沒關系的  不用了
Oh, no. That's all right. Don't bother.

不到二十分鐘就能弄好
Oh, it won't take 20 minutes.

29
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,610
要是不裝的話  你用不了
Plus, you really can't use it if I don't do it.

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,350
不  沒事  我們不會用的
No, it's all right. We're not gonna.

31
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,590
你這邊弄好以后
Uh, when you're done here,

你為什么不摸黑坐著

天啊  今天這一下午啊

兩小時前  我把鱸魚拿出來

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,750
結果突然就停電了
than -- boom! -- power goes down.

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,840
我給市里打過電話了
I get on the phone to the city.

65
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,450
長話短說
To make a long story short,

66
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,820
那幫公共服務公司的傻瓜弄混了我的電費
those bozos at PNM mixed up my payment.

67
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,660
圣克里斯托瓦爾路512號那個賴賬的

他們說明天之前會來電
They say they'll have it on again by tomorrow.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,560
與此同時  我向鄰居借了些野營裝備
In the meantime, I borrowed some camping gear from my neighbors.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
所以才弄得這么鄉野氣息
Hence, the rustic flair.

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,170
-天啊  -是啊
- Jeez. - Oh, yeah.

出門下館子嗎

還有魚  不吃的話只能把它扔了
And the fish -- I would have just had to throw it out.

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,010
我只需要把它放進鍋里就行了
All I have to do is toss it in a pan.

82
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,840
要不我們湊合一下算了
How about we just rough it?

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,490
你們同意嗎
You okay with that?

84
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,010

為了讓我們心情好起來
‭To make ourselves feel better?

137
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,830
你說"我們肯定吃不完這么多"
You said, "We'll never finish this!"

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,290
結果我們吃完了

說話啊
Say something.

181
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,830
不顧一起就餐的人
It is incredibly bad manners

182
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,290
去接電話  這樣太無禮了
to answer a cellphone in company.

183
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,070
太粗魯了
It's very rude.

184
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,900
對不起
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

185
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,860
我不知道你會這么想
I-I didn't know that you felt that way.

186
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,790
我沒想冒犯你  查克
I...didn't mean to offend you, Chuck.

187
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,340
我可能反應過激了
I-I may have overreacted.

188
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,570
我太唐突了
That was very abrupt.

198
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,460
我打車就行
A cab is the easiest.

199
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,090
你得做點什么
You gotta do somethin'.

200
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,970
你不能讓她這樣走掉
Y-You can't let her leave like this.

她會理解的
She'll understand.

204
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,640
你寧可讓她覺得你是個暴躁的混蛋
She'll -- Would you rather she think you're a raging prick

205
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,880
也不愿說出真相嗎
than know the truth?

206
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,390
不
No.

207
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,840
如果你不說  我去告訴她
Look, if you won't tell her, then I will.

208
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,850
不不不
No, no. No!

209
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,030
你不許告訴她
You will not tell her.

210
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,430
你不許告訴她
You...will not tell her.

211
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,160
好吧
All right.

212
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,700
安德烈  真抱歉
Hi, Andre. Yes, I'm sorry about that.

213
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,880
我把手機弄掉了
I dropped the phone.

214
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,020
{\an8}絕命律師
第三季  第五集

215
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,210
天啊  你在搞什么  伙計
Jesus. What're you doing, man?

216
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,060
袋子里都快沒氧氣了
There's barely any oxygen in that bag.

217
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,100
-你快把她悶死了  -"她"
- You're suffocating her! - "Her"?

218
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,470
對  你沒看到漂浮著的小丁丁
Yeah, just because ‭you don't see swingin' dicks

219
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,100
不代表你就分不清它的性別
doesn't mean you can't tell a boy fish from a girl fish.

220
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,010
明白了
Oh, yeah, see.

221
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,740
我看到它的口紅了
Now I can see the lipstick.

222
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,540
這是一條生命  不是一件家具
This is a living creature. It's not a piece of furniture.

223
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,480
我們會面結束后  你帶她回去
So, after this, you take her home.

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,180
把她放到一個大魚缸里  至少一加侖那種
You put her in a big bowl, at least a gallon.

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,510
弄個好的換氣閥  再放條清道夫
‭Get a good bubbler, maybe a plecostomus.

226
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,250
別喂她太多了
And don't feed her too much.

227
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,420
人會變胖
People get fat.

228
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,630
魚會淹死在吃剩的食物里
Fish, they drown in leftover food.

229
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,740
好了好了  海洋學家
All right already, Jacques Cousteau.

230
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,950
我懂了
Point made.

231
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,250
那就好
Good.

232
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,020
我猜我們那位朋友讓你來找我
I'm guessing our friend didn't refer you to me

233
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,200
不是為了養魚建議吧
to get ichthyological advice.

234
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,050
我要找個能靈活處事的人
I'm looking for someone with a light touch.

235
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,200
我說的不是那種在連鎖超市
I'm not talking some teenager taking a five-finger discount

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,820
偷塊奶酪的毛頭小子
on string cheese at the Stop 'N' Shop.

237
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,380
我需要專業  高端  嚴謹的人選
I need highly skilled, high-end, discreet.

238
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,040
真正的專家
A real pro.

239
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,950
你會把他也放在狹小的空間里嗎
You gotta fit him in a tight space?

240
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
應該不會
I don't think so.

241
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,320
那我認識你要找的人
I got just the guy, then.

242
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,670
所以我說打高爾夫能廣結人脈
That's why I say golfing is a contact sport.

243
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,210
干得好  韋克斯勒小姐  真是鼓舞人心
Great job, Ms. Wexler. Very refreshing.

244
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,380
相信我  我們很高興這案子沒上庭審
Believe me, uh, we're happy to get this one off the docket.

245
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,820
那也沒我們高興
Not as happy as we are.

246
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,610
干得漂亮
Again, great job.

247
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,090
謝謝  謝謝你  先生
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

248
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,220
女士們  晚飯我請客
Ladies, dinner's on me.

249
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,650
金  我們知道你很棒  但不知道你這么棒
Kim, I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were this good.

250
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,500
我很高興你們滿意
Oh, I'm glad you're happy.

251
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,460
沒有你我們不可能成功
We couldn't have done it without you.

252
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,410
希望你明白
And I hope you realize

253
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,860
這表示以后有好多活兒等著你呢
this means a whole lot a work comin' your way.

254
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,180
那太棒了
Oh, that's -- that's great.

255
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,310
聽上去可不像太棒了
Well, you don't sound like it's great.

256
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,290
我不想掃興
I hate to be a buzzkill,

257
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,850
但我們進一步合作前  有件事
but there is something you need to hear

258
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,740
我得告訴你們
before we get any deeper in.

259
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,750
關于你們的前任律師  查爾斯·麥吉爾
It's about your former attorney, Charles McGill.

260
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,460
他怎么了
What about him?

261
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,700
查爾斯對他弟弟吉米
Charles has been making

262
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,260
提出了一些非常嚴重的指控
some very ugly allegations about his brother, Jimmy,

263
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,740
而我碰巧和吉米同一間辦公室
with whom I happen to share an office space.

264
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,460
指控  關于什么的
Allegations? Of what?

265
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,110
查爾斯認為吉米
Charles thinks that Jimmy

266
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,950
趁他在家整理文件時
somehow took control of your documents

267
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,310
搞到了你們的文件
while he was working on them at his home.

268
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,970
他覺得吉米對數字進行了移位
He believes Jimmy transposed the address numbers.

269
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,210
把數字移位
Transposed the numbers?

270
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,410
他怎么可能做到
How would he even do that?

271
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,590
查爾斯聲稱吉米拿走了
Charles contends that Jimmy took the documents

272
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,900
與羅塞拉分行相關的文件
pertaining to the Rosella branch

273
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,620
趁自己身體欠佳時
and, while Charles was indisposed,

274
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,270
復印并篡改了它們
photocopied and doctored them.

275
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,230
這太異想天開了
That's pretty baroque.

276
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,190
重要的是
The important thing here

277
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,640
我覺得這件事可能會引起輿論關注
is I think it could make some noise in public.

278
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,100
很快
Soon.

279
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,980
我想毫無隱瞞地把這件事告訴你們
I wanted to tell you this in the spirit of full disclosure.

280
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,860
你們還是從我這知道比較好
I thought it was better if you heard it from me.

281
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,860
如果你們有任何顧慮
If you have any reservations at this point

282
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,810
或者對于與我合作感覺不自在
or if you are not comfortable staying with me,

283
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,310
我們可以討論接下來怎么做
we can discuss options.

284
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,150
要說有什么是我不能容忍的
If there's one thing I cannot abide,

285
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,560
就是一個人不能承擔自己的過錯
it's a man who won't own up to his mistakes.

286
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,450
不管麥吉爾在搞什么名堂  都不會
Now, whatever mud McGill is slinging he's not gonna

287
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,570
讓我放棄我見過的最棒的律師
screw me out of the best outside counsel I've ever had.

288
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,080
這...
That's...

289
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,870
我太高興了
I'm so glad to hear that.

290
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,070
我們很感謝你提醒我們
We appreciate the heads-up,

291
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,680
但你可以不用擔心這件事了
but you can call this baby put to bed.

292
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,530
說回正題  晚餐
Now the most important thing -- dinner.

293
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,300
七點行嗎
7:00 good for you?

294
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,410
-我沒問題  -好極了
- Uh, works for me. - Great.

295
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,700
我們商量下接下來的戰略
We'll talk strategy --

296
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,290
是先在科羅拉多州還是先在猶他州
We move on Colorado or Utah first?

297
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,860
七點見
See ya at 7:00.

298
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,520
麥吉爾的事
This McGill thing.

299
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,500
你確定沒問題嗎
You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?

300
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,970
確定
I am.

301
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,860
絕對不會牽扯到梅薩維德
Mesa Verde isn't involved in any way, shape, or form.

302
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,560
那就好
Okay. Good.

303
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,980
那么晚上見了
Then, I'll see you tonight.

304
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,840
好的  晚上見
Okay, great. See you then.

305
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,580
{\an8}出口

306
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,310
好了  就是這樣
Okay, this is it.

307
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,090
我們可以關掉所有燈光和麥克風
We can run without lights and mics.

308
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,490
在你作證期間
We'll collect all cellphones

309
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,560
將手機統一收集并保存
and hold them for the duration of your testimony.

310
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,690
可以讓法庭書記官
The, uh, court reporter, would it be possible

311
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,960
待在離證人席遠一點的地方嗎
to move him or her farther from the witness stand?

312
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,940
可以  我們可以
Um, yeah, ‭I think we can arrange

313
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,460
把他們安排在法庭后部
having them ‭in the back of the court.

314
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,380
抱歉  這個出口標志的燈光只能保留
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about the exit signs.

315
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,460
這是規定
It's code.

316
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,790
感謝你所做的一切
I appreciate all you're doing.

317
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,850
謝謝
Thank you.

318
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,240
阿利先生  可以讓我們單獨待一會嗎
Mr. Alley, I wonder if you'd give us a moment.

319
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,040
我想跟我的同事商量些事情
I'd like to go over something with my colleague.

320
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,110
沒問題  我在外面等你們
No problem. I'll be outside when you're ready.

321
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,130
霍華德
Howard?

322
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,110
你感覺怎么樣  查克
How you feeling, Chuck?

323
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,660
我可以應付過去的
I'll muddle through.

324
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,340
因為要問很多問題
Because this is a lot to ask.

325
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,080
如果你堅持不下來
And if you're not up to it -- just throwing this out there --

326
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,300
那就不如不來作證了
maybe you don't need to testify at all.

327
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,270
不  我要來
No, I do.

328
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,750
我是唯一一個能解釋清楚
I'm the only person who can adequately explain

329
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,190
那盤磁帶是怎么回事的人
the context of that tape.

330
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,230
否則  辯方會歪曲事實的
Otherwise, the defense'll tear it to shreds.

331
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,150
這個案子已經板上釘釘了
It's already a solid case.

332
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,290
我們有吉米訴前轉移的陳述
We have Jimmy's statement from the Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

333
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,520
有我和私家偵探的證詞
There's my testimony and the private eye's.

334
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,480
也許你不必親自到這來遭這份罪
Maybe there's no need to put you through the wringer like this.

335
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,750
重點不是我或者我的身體健康
This isn't about me or my health.

336
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,320
重點在于公關
This is about PR.

337
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,770
我們失去了一個委托人
We lost a client.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,480
原因在于  你失去行動能力
That happened because, while you were...incapacitated,

339
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,130
使你弟弟獲取了
your brother accessed documents

340
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,790
本應保存在律所的文件
that should have been secured at HHM.

341
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,200
吉米的所作所為確實很過分
What Jimmy did ‭is unconscionable, yes...

342
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,570
但我的工作之一是維護公司的聲譽
but one of my jobs is to safeguard the firm's reputation.

343
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,400
現在不是擔心聲譽的時候
This is not the time to worry about how we look.

344
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,950
我們面對的是大是大非的問題
This is about what's right and what's wrong.

345
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,310
我不想讓吉米
I'm not gonna risk Jimmy getting, what?

346
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,170
只是被禁止執業一年  或者兩年
A year's suspension? Maybe two?

347
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,100
他應該被取消律師資格  而不是略受懲戒
He deserves disbarment, not some slap on the wrist.

348
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,580
不  霍華德  只有這一條路可選
No, Howard. ‭There's only one way forward.

349
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,780
縱使天塌下來  該算的賬也要算
Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.

350
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,710
抱歉久等了  安排得非常好
Sorry to keep you waiting. This'll do nicely.

351
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,060
請向委員會轉達我的謝意
Please extend my thanks to the Committee for their flexibility.

352
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,960
早上好  我是州律師協會的羅伯特·阿利
Good morning. I'm Robert Alley for the State Bar.

353
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,670
就詹姆斯·M·麥吉爾先生一案
In the matter of James M. McGill,

354
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,240

16條102款

357
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,850
從事律師所知是犯罪的行為
engaging in conduct a lawyer knows is criminal.

358
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,020
麥吉爾先生明知損壞其兄長家的大門

359
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,460
是犯罪行為

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,820
16條804款
16-804 --

361
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,540
作為律師  其犯罪行為

362
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,160
對律師的誠實守信產生了不利影響
on the lawyer's honesty or trustworthiness as a lawyer.

363
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,940
任何理性的人都會同意
Any reasonable person would agree

364
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,290
在另一位律師的家中對其進行攻擊
that assaulting another lawyer in his own home

365
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,450
對麥吉爾先生的律師身份產生了惡劣影響
reflects badly on Mr. McGill's fitness as an attorney.

366
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,630
16條304款

367
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,170

或隱藏具有潛在證據價值的材料
or concealing material having potential evidentiary value.

369
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
麥吉爾先生闖進其兄長家中
Mr. McGill broke into his brother's home

370
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,420
毀壞了一盤盒式錄音磁帶
and destroyed an audiocassette

371
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,670
其中包含一段他和他哥哥
which contained a recording of a conversation

372
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,650
查爾斯·麥吉爾  之間的對話錄音
between himself and his brother, Charles McGill.

373
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,900
我們將說明  這段錄音
We will show that this recording was evidence

374
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,610
是一件進行中案件的證據
in an ongoing legal case.

375
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,170
州律師協會認為
The State Bar believes that,

376
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,290
一旦我們展示了事實
once we have presented the facts,

377

委員會將會同意

378
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,570
取消詹姆斯·麥吉爾的律師資格

379
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,050
謝謝
Thank you very much.

380
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,770
謝謝  阿利先生
Thank you, Mr. Alley.

381
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,450
韋克斯勒女士

382
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,500
謝謝  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

383
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,800
早上好
Good morning.

384
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,850
我是金·韋克斯勒  詹姆斯·麥吉爾的協理辯護律師
I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel with James McGill, for the defense.

385
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,160
各位都已經閱讀了麥吉爾先生的訴前轉移陳述
You've already read Mr. McGill's Pre-Prosecution Statement.

386
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,470
對于非法闖入他哥哥家里這點我們并無疑義
We don't dispute he broke into his brother's house,

387
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,230
而他也對此深感后悔
an act he regrets...deeply.

388
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,210
但這個故事還有另外一面
But there is another side to this story.

389
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,210
無關算計
One not about calculation

390
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,490
及居心不良
or ill intent,

391
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,040
是關于兩兄弟
but about two brothers,

392
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,880
他們的關系  經過數年糾葛
whose relationship, after years of strain,

393
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,140
最終破裂
finally broke.

394
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,310
我們相信  了解事情全部真相后
We believe that, after you have the complete picture,

395
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,210
各位就會明白  詹姆斯·麥吉爾
you'll understand James McGill is an asset

396
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,560
是法律界不可或缺的一員
to our legal community.

397
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,000
他應該保持協會正式成員的身份
And he should remain a full member of it in good standing.

398
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,660
謝謝
Thank you.

399
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,250
謝謝  韋克斯勒女士
Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

400
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,200
好了  如果各位都準備好了...
Okay, if, uh, everyone's ready to begin testimony...

401
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,680
阿利先生  傳喚你的證人
Mr. Alley, call your witness.

402
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
砰  砰  砰
Bang! Bang! Bang!

403
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,300
然后他就踢破了大門
Then he kicked down the door.

404
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,650
吉米很激動  不停地大喊大叫
Jimmy was very agitated. He was shouting.

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
他要求查爾斯
He demanded Charles turn over

406
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,640
-把他收集的證據交出來  -反對
- the evidence he'd been collecting -- - Objection.

407
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,870
我們還沒有確認磁帶是證物
We haven't established the tape is evidence of anything.

408
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,330
辯方只承認它是一項財產
The defense has only acknowledged it as a piece of property.

409
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,900
請讓我重新表述
Allow me to rephrase.

410
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,890
吉米要求查爾斯交出屬于他的一盤磁帶
Jimmy demanded an audiocassette in Charles' possession,

411
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,040
接著
which Jimmy proceeded,

412
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,880
他用一根撥火棍
with the help of an iron fireplace implement,

413
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,180
撬開了查爾斯的書桌
to pry from Charles' desk.

414
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,190
然后  他便將磁帶毀掉了
He then broke the cassette into pieces

415
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,840
轉而與他哥哥對峙
and went on to confront his brother.

416
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,260
被告毀壞磁帶后發生了什么
What happened after the defendant smashed this tape?

417
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,840
布賴特比爾先生和我
Mr. Brightbill and I --

418
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,290
那是查爾斯雇的私家偵探嗎
That's the private investigator that Charles hired?

419
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,590
是的
That's correct.

420
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,380
我們認為吉米可能會襲擊他哥哥
He and I were concerned that Jimmy might strike his brother.

421
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,490
所有我們介入了
So that's when we stepped in.

422
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,570
-謝謝  哈姆林先生  -不客氣
- Thank you, Mr. Hamlin. ‭Certainly.

423
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,030
我沒有問題了
Nothing further at this time.

424
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,380
韋克斯勒女士
Ms. Wexler?

425
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,840
謝謝  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

426
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,600
你說你認識我的當事人一段時間了
You testified you've known my client for some time.

427
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,160
具體是多久
How long exactly?

428
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,090
快十年了
Nearly 10 years.

429
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
你是怎么認識他的
How did you come to know him?

430
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,570
他哥哥讓我雇他在公司收發室工作
His brother asked to hire him in the mailroom at our firm.

431
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,010
-然后你就雇了  -是的
- And you did. ‭- Yes.

432
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,760
你當時認為他是個什么樣的人
What was your opinion of him then?

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
我認為
I thought

434
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,480
他是個很積極的人
he had a lot of get-up-and-go.

435
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,300
工作非常努力
He was a hard worker.

436
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,020
你還給他取了個外號  是嗎
You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

437
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
"騙子查理"
"Charlie Hustle."

438
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,160
"騙子查理"
"Charlie Hustle."

439
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,270
當你發現他成了律師時感覺如何
How'd you feel when you found out he'd become a lawyer?

440
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,600
驚訝
Surprised.

441
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,260
他自己從法律學校畢業
He'd put himself through law school

442
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,410
通過律師資格考試  沒告訴任何合伙人
and taken the Bar exam without telling any of the partners.

443
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,530
甚至是查爾斯
Even Charles.

444
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,620
他在你的收發室工作
He bootstrapped his way into a law degree

445
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,220
還單打獨斗拿了法學學位
while working in your mailroom.

446
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,930
你們有想過把他雇為律師嗎
Did you consider taking him on as an associate?

447
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,120
有的
We did.

448
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,200
但時間不長
Briefly.

449
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,880
你們似乎沒有雇傭他  為什么
Sounds like you didn't hire him. Why not?

450
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,070
他可是那么努力
With that kind of grit.

451
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,850
合伙人覺得最好
The partners decided it would be best

452
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,180
避免裙帶關系的出現
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

453
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,610
我們認為雇傭吉米可能有損風紀
We felt hiring Jimmy might damage morale.

454
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,930
裙帶關系
Nepotism.

455
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,460
你們是叫"哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所"  對吧
Your firm is "Hamlin, Hamlin, and McGill," Right?

456
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,230
另一位哈姆林是誰
Who's the other Hamlin?

457
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,150
我父親
My father.

458
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,950
哪位合伙人最擔心裙帶關系
Which partner was the most concerned with nepotism?

459
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,140
查爾斯·麥吉爾
Charles McGill.

460
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,090
所以是吉米的親兄長將他拒之門外
So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.

461
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,020
反對
Objection.

462
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,270
哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的雇傭辦法
How are the hiring practices of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill

463
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,370
跟此案有何關聯
relevant here?

464
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,860
有助于理解他們兄弟間的關系
It's relevant to understand the relationship between these brothers.

465
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,280
你可以問  韋克斯勒女士
We'll, uh, give you some leeway, Ms. Wexler,

466
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,990
但也別偏離太多
but don't stray too far.

467
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,440
查爾斯·麥吉爾不是本場聽證會的主角
Charles McGill is not the subject of this hearing.

468
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,490
謝謝
Thank you.

469
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,580
吉米知道他兄長正是
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one

470
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,260
阻止你們雇傭他的人嗎
that prevented you from hiring him?

471
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,390
他不知道
No. He did not.

472
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,280
他最后進了戴維斯梅因律所
Eventually, he was hired by the firm of Davis & Main.

473
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,040
我很樂意多提一句  如果你想
I'd be happy to say more about that, if you'd like.

474
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,640
不  謝謝
No. Thank you.

475
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,980
查爾斯出狀況后
When Charles' condition appeared,

476
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,700
吉米在照顧他  對嗎
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

477
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
是的
I believe so.

478
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,080
吉米在想方設法建立自己的律師業務
Jimmy was struggling to build his solo law practice,

479
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,140
不過他一直雷打不動地
and yet, every single day, without fail,

480
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,500
給他兄長帶食物  生活用品
he brought his brother food, supplies --

481
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,860
甚至是他最愛的報紙  是嗎
even his favorite newspapers. Isn't that right?

482
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,910
是的
He did.

483
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,090
你能談談查爾斯的休假條款嗎
Could you speak to the terms of Charles' leave of absence?

484
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,340
你知道我不能
You know I can't.

485
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
是家庭和醫療假  詳情都是機密
It was an FMLA leave. Anything more is confidential.

486
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,500
但你能確定是精神疾病  對吧
But you can confirm it was due to mental illness, correct?

487
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,140
反對  查爾斯·麥吉爾的精神健康不在討論范疇
Objection! Charles McGill's mental health isn't at issue.

488
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,960
這是對律師協會下位證人的抹黑
This is a smear job on the State Bar's upcoming witness --

489
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,030
僅此而已
nothing more.

490
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,110
這不是資格聽證會  韋克斯勒女士
This is not a competency hearing, Ms. Wexler.

491
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,500
哈姆林先生不是精神病專家
Mr. Hamlin is not a psychiatric professional.

492
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,190
你有更多與他經歷
Do you have any questions that would be more germane

493
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,590
更相關的問題嗎
to his experience?

494
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,580
沒了
No.

495
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,880
我沒有更多問題了
I have nothing further.

496
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,830
請證人離席
The witness is excused.

497
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,250
現在  律師協會
At this time, the State Bar would like

498
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,570
想展示五號證物
to enter Exhibit Five into evidence.

499
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,770
我們要求播放查爾斯·麥吉爾的錄音
We ask that Charles McGill's recording be played.

500
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,290
恕我重申我的反對意見
I'm respectfully renewing my objection.

501
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,040
播放這一證物的證明價值
The probative value of playing this Exhibit

502
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,720
不及這一證物的有害影響
is outweighed ‭by how prejudicial it is.

503
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,100
恕我直言  韋克斯勒女士
All due respect to Ms. Wexler,

504
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,550
律師協會認為這對聽證很重要
but the State Bar feels this is fundamental to hear.

505
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,710
我們不希望留下
We don't want to leave any question

506
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,780
對雙方意圖的疑問
as to the intentions of both parties.

507
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,850
韋克斯勒女士  我們在駁回你查禁證據的動議時
Ms. Wexler, we already ruled this was fair game

508
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,860
就已經裁定這是公平的
when we denied your motion to suppress.

509
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,740
另外  你委托人的胡作非為撇開不談
I'll add, the rough-and-tumble of your client's conduct aside,

510
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,330
我們得知道一名律師
we need to know whether one lawyer

511
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,700
是否嘗試篡改另一名律師的證據
attempted to tamper with another's evidence.

512
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,630
來
Come here.

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,080
你還在這里做什么
‭‭What are you still doing here?

514
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,260
航班延誤了
Flight's delayed.

515
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,560
延誤了多久
How delayed?

516
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,490
我剛查是四十分鐘
40 minutes, last I checked.

517
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,660
靠  通知我進展
Shit. Okay. Keep me posted.

518
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,420
行
Yes.

519
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,340
好了
Here we go.

520
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,260
謝謝你們耐心等待
Thank you for your patience.

521
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,980
律師協會準備好了
The State Bar is ready to proceed.

522
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,970
抱歉
Um, begging your pardon.

523
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,880
被告要求復核  行嗎
Um, the defense requests a moment to review, if we could?

524
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,040
行
All right.

525
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,600
等你們準備好
When you're ready.

526
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,480
謝謝  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

527
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,790
這是干什么
What are we doing?

528
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,980
我們在拖
We're stalling.

529
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,960
沒錯  沒錯
Yes. Yes.

530
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,650
我弟弟有許多令人欣賞的品質
My brother has many admirable qualities.

531
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,930
從某種程度上來說  我挺欣賞他
I-In some ways, I can say I admire him.

532
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,150
太冷漠了
Too cold.

533
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,540
我愛我弟弟
I love my brother.

534
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,550
但泰德·卡辛斯基[恐怖分子]的兄弟也愛他
But Ted Kaczynski's brother loved him, too.

535
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,650
他也想幫忙
And he wanted to help.

536
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,250
太道貌岸然了
That's sanctimonious.

537
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,500
我愛我弟弟
I love my brother.

538
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,990
他是個好人  他有好的一面
He's a good person. He has good in him.

539
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,240
但法律太重要了
But the law is too important.

540
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,010
馬上到  霍華德
Be right there, Howard!

541
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,180
法律太重要了
The law is too important.

542
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,660
不然我怎么可能說出來
I sure as shit wouldn't be tellin' ya otherwise.

543
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,900
但沒錯  這就是真相
But, yes... it's the truth.

544
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,070
你這么大費周章就為了羞辱我嗎
You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?

545
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,740
我是為了金
I did it for Kim!

546
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,530
她廢寢忘食拿下梅薩維德銀行
She worked her butt off to get Mesa Verde

547
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,710
而你和霍華德就喝喝威士忌坐享其成
while you and Howard sat around sipping scotch and chortling.

548
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,120
什么哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill --

549
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,850
應該叫吝嗇鬼律所才對
more like Scrooge and Marley!

550
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,680
梅薩維德銀行是金的
Kim deserves Mesa Verde --

551
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,200
不是你  也不是哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的
not you, not HHM.

552
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,890
她爭取來的  她需要它
She earned it, and she needs it!

553
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,560
我這么做是為了幫她
I did it to help her,

554
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,210
但我真不知道這會給你帶來那么大的傷害
but I-I honestly didn't think it would hurt you so bad.

555
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,870
我以為你只會說  "靠  我犯了個錯誤"
I thought you'd just say, "Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

556
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,400
然后繼續過你的日子  這才是正常人會干的
and go on with your life, like a normal person!

557
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,600
可你偏不
But, oh, no!

558
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,130
是我太天真
Wishful thinking!

559
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,380
所以  我能不能告訴霍華德
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

560
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,310
你不辭職也不退休了
you're not quitting or retiring or whatever?

561
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,640
還有  能不能把這些破玩意從墻上弄下來
And can we take all this shit down off the walls?

562
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,180
我這就打電話給霍華德
I'm gonna go call Howard.

563
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,730
吉米
Jimmy.

564
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,980
你剛剛承認犯了一項重罪你知道吧
You do realize ‭you just confessed to a felony?

565
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,770
算是吧
I guess.

566
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,310
可你覺得好多了  是吧
But you feel better, right?

567
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,220
再說了  就我們倆  空口無憑
Besides, ‭it's your word against mine.

568
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,460
好了  阿利先生
All right, uh, Mr. Alley, uh,

569
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,380
我們得為下一位證人安排一下
we need to make accommodations for your next witness.

570
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,100
對嗎
Is that correct?

571
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
-是  主席先生  -行
- Yes, Mr. Chairman. - All right.

572
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,460
告訴大家  我們得準備一下房間
For those who don't know, we need to prepare the room.

573
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,640
員工會收好你們的手機
Uh, the clerk is going to collect your, uh, cellphones,

574
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,060
手表  密鑰卡  一切電子設備
watches, key fobs -- anything electrical.

575
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,930
如果你們不想這么做
If you prefer not to,

576
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,890
請把東西放到房間之外保管好  謝謝
please secure your items outside this room. Thank you.

577
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,240
謝謝你們的理解
Thank you for understanding.

578
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,100
你的手機  先生
Your phone, sir?

579
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,460
我留在車里了
I left it in the car.

580
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,680
-不好意思  -抱歉
- Oh. Excuse me. - Sorry.

581
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,230
-那是你的  -謝謝
- That's yours. - Thanks.

582
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,620
請舉起你的右手
Please raise your right hand.

583
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,600
你發誓或確認道出事實  沒有隱瞞
Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth,

584
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,020
只說事實嗎
and nothing but the truth?

585
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,040
是的
I do.

586
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,470
你能說出你的姓名嗎
Could you state your name?

587
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,280
查爾斯·L·麥吉爾
Charles L. McGill.

588
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,490
我是哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的高級合伙人
I'm a senior partner at the law firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

589
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,570
法院書記官能聽得見嗎
Can the court reporter hear me?

590
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,480
聽得見  先生  我能聽清楚
Yes, sir. I can hear you fine.

591
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,500
麥吉爾先生  我盡量簡短一點
Mr. McGill, I'll try to be brief.

592
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,280
我們不必詳述入室行竊
We don't need to dwell on the burglary

593
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,040
或是你遭受侵襲的過程
or the assault that you suffered.

594
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,520
謝謝  我很感激
Thank you. I appreciate that.

595
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,740
我想知道關于這盤磁帶的事
What I would like to hear about is this tape.

596
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,430
什么迫使你錄下了這盤磁帶
What compelled you to make it?

597
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,770
我懷疑我弟弟篡改了我當時經手的
I had a suspicion my brother had tampered with documents

598
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,250
一個案子的文件
in a case I was working on.

599
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,660
他為什么要這么做
And why would he do that?

600
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,780
聽起來不怎么像兄弟所為
Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.

601
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,400
我認為他希望篡改的文件
I believe it was his hope that the tainted documents

602
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,670
會讓客戶打消讓我為其辯護的念頭
would cause the client to become disillusioned with my representation

603
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,750
而聘用他們之前的律師  韋克斯勒小姐
and return to their previous attorney, Ms. Wexler. ‭

604
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,420
這里我要說明一下  他們如愿以償了
Which, I should note, is precisely what happened.

605
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,500
反對
Objection.

606
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,000
我不是說韋克斯勒小姐對吉米的行為知情
I'm not saying Ms. Wexler knew what Jimmy was doing

607
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,540
或是參與其中
or had any involvement.

608
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,690
我只是指出結果的確如此
I'm only stating that it happened.

609
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,170
關于你對詹姆斯的懷疑
Did you have any evidence

610
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,170
你有證據證明嗎
to support your suspicions about James?

611
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,300
沒有  我的弟弟
No. My brother,

612
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,040
拋開別的不講  聰明過人
whatever else can be said of him, can be quite clever.

613
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,490
將自己的行徑掩蓋得非常好
Did an excellent job of covering his tracks.

614
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,530
反對
Objection.

615
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,880
證人剛承認了沒有相關證據
The witness has admitted there's no corroborating evidence

616
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,030
證明當事人犯下如上罪行
this supposed crime even occurred.

617
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,870
我想聽聽他要說什么
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

618
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,940
請繼續
We're going to continue.

619
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,410
你也可以進行盤問  韋克斯勒女士
Uh, we'll extend you the same latitude on cross, Ms. Wexler.

620
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,160
繼續  麥吉爾先生
Go on, Mr. McGill.

621
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,810
由于沒有確鑿證據
Without physical evidence,

622
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,730
我覺得能錄下他承認罪行
I felt that ‭a recorded confession --

623
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,090
如果我能錄到的話  是最好的機會
if I could get one -- was my best bet.

624
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,800
就本身而言  我知道這盤磁帶會沒有那么周密
On its own, I knew the tape would be somewhat flimsy,

625
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,130
但是個開始
but it was a start.

626
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,990
為更為縝密的立案打下基礎
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

627
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
我猜吉米肯定覺得
I suppose that Jimmy must have felt

628
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,060
那盤磁帶本身是一個有力的證據
the tape was decisive evidence on its own.

629
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,980
不然的話  他也不會闖進我家將它毀壞
Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it.

630
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,920
反對  還是任意猜測
Objection. More speculation.

631
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,710
他怎么能知道吉米腦中的想法
How can he know what was going on in Jimmy's head?

632
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,860
反對有效  我們只需要了解事情經過
Sustained. We just need to hear what happened,

633
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,490
麥吉爾先生
Mr. McGill.

634
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,550
很抱歉
I-I apologize.

635
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,720
我給我弟弟錄了音  對他進行立案
I recorded my brother to build a case against him.

636
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,170
在那時
And at the time,

637
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,540
可以說你的神志是完全清醒的嗎
would you say that you were in possession of your faculties?

638
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,900
恕我冒昧
All due respect, but --

639
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,720
但你在錄音中聽起來有一點神經錯亂
but you do sound somewhat unhinged on the recording.

640
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,100
是的  我能理解
Yes, I understand that.

641
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,560
但你所聽到的是戲劇
But what you heard was theater.

642
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,420
一場表演  是我假扮的
A performance, play-acting.

643
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,180
我夸張了我所患疾病的病征
I exaggerated the symptoms of my disease

644
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,540
以獲取事實真相
to extract the truth.

645
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,800
我們能談論一下你的疾病嗎
Can we talk about your disease for a moment?

646
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,300
我希望在場各位都能對其達成共識
I'd like everybody here to be on the same page about it.

647
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,200
當然可以
Of course.

648
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,670
有人稱之為EHS
It is sometimes referred to as EHS,

649
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,970
電磁過敏癥
electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

650
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,660
我稱之為對電磁的急性過敏
I describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.

651
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,100
這并不是一個常見的病癥  對嗎
It's not a common condition, is it?

652
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,610
我知道這聽起來很奇怪  確實如此
I know it sounds strange. I do.

653
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,880
但三十年前  沒有人聽說過花生過敏
But 30 years ago, no one had heard of peanut allergies.

654
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,490
但你承認沒有人
But you admit that no one --

655
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,210
沒有醫生對你做出過診斷
no doctor -- has ever diagnosed you.

656
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,220
艾滋病直到1981年才被確診
AIDS was not identified properly until 1981.

657
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,550
直到83年才知道艾滋病是由艾滋病病毒引起
HIV wasn't known as the cause until '83.

658
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,000
這些事情需要時間來解釋  對醫生也是如此
These things take time to unravel, even for doctors.

659
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,230
你覺得你的病情
Would you say that your illness

660
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,220
會影響你清晰地思考嗎
affects your ability to think clearly?

661
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,360
不會  只會對我的生理造成影響
No. ‭It affects me physically.

662
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,840
會導致我產生劇烈的疼痛
It causes me great pain.

663
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,760
但我還是完全清醒的
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

664
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,950
謝謝
Thank you.

665
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,400
麥吉爾先生  我還有最后一個問題要問你
Mr. McGill, I have ‭only one more question for you.

666
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,560
你恨你的弟弟嗎
Do you hate your brother?

667
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,140
一點兒也不恨
Absolutely not.

668
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,550
我愛我的弟弟
I love my brother.

669
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,670
吉米本性并不壞
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

670
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,410
他總喜歡出于所謂高尚的理由
He has a way of doing the worst things

671
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,170
去做那些惡劣的事情
for reasons ‭that sound almost noble.

672
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,720
但我心中深知
But what I know for sure is that the law

673
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,130
法律神圣不可褻瀆
is too important to be toyed with.

674
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,290
這是人類最偉大的成就
It's mankind's greatest achievement

675
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,090
法治
the Rule of Law,

676
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,760
法治的意義就在于  不管你是誰
the idea that, no matter who you are,

677
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,390
你的行為都會產生后果
your actions have consequences.

678
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,730
而我弟弟對待法律的方式
And the way my brother treats the law --

679
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,340
讓我心碎不已
it breaks my heart.

680
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,300
所以我要這么做
That's why I did what I did.

681
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,620
不是為了傷害他  而是保護我所尊重的東西
Not to hurt him, but to protect something that I hold sacred.

682
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
謝謝  麥吉爾先生
Thank you, Mr. McGill.

683
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,380
州律師協會盤問完畢
The State Bar rests.

684
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,630
我覺得我們需要暫停一下
I think we need to put on the brakes.

685
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,810
抱歉  我和我的合伙律師需要時間商討
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and I need a moment to confer.

686
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,630
請盡快  律師
Please be brief, counselor.

687
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,160
好的
Yes, of course.

688
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,820
她會來
She'll be here.

689
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,560
你有想盤問他的嗎
Do you have anything for cross?

690
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,790
我能看一下你的筆記嗎
Can I look at your notes?

691
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,490
當然可以
Yeah, of course.

692
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,940
我們能...
Can we, um...

693
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,700
好的
Yeah.

694
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,990
很高興你能來
So glad you made it.

695
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,420
主席先生  不好意思
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.

696
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,760
我能去透口氣嗎
might I have a moment, to get a breath?

697
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,720
當然  麥吉爾先生
Oh, of course, Mr. McGill.

698
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,860
大伙  我們休庭十五分鐘
Uh, folks, let's call this 15.

699
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,160
大家  請準時回庭繼續聽審
Everybody, please be back and ready to go on the hour.

700
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,960
-麗貝卡  -查克
- Rebecca. - Chuck.

701
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,590
很高興見到你
It's good to see you.

702
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,610
不得不說  我有點兒意外
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

703
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,610
吉米傳訊你了嗎
Did Jimmy subpoena you?

704
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,260
你不在證人名單上  你不必作證
You're not on the witness list. You don't have to testify.

705
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,230
不不不  我不是來作證的
No, no, no, no. I'm not here for that.

706
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,850
那是來干什么的
Well, what, then?

707
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,690
查克  多希望你能告訴我
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

708
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,700
我不敢相信你經歷了什么
I-I can't believe what you've been going through.

709
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,970
有多久了
How long has it been?

710
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,410
你是來幫我的
You're here to help.

711
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,380
因為這一切對我來說壓力太大了
Because all this is so stressful for me.

712
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,820
吉米是這么跟你說的嗎
Is that what Jimmy told you?

713
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,220
他很擔心你  查克
He's worried about you, Chuck.

714
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,320
盡管你們之間發生了這么多事
In spite of everything that's happened between the two of you,

715
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,400
他  他還是關心你的
he -- he cares.

716
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,020
他究竟說了什么
What exactly did he say?

717
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,100
他說你病了
Um, well, that you had been sick.

718
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,080
對電磁過敏
Allergic to electricity?

719
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,910
他給我看了你家的照片
He sent me pictures of the house.

720
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,820
查克  天啊
Chuck, my God. ‭

721
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,820
你為什么沒有告訴我
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,760
我不想讓你心煩
I didn't want to upset you.

723
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,090
讓你產生顧慮
Worry you unnecessarily.

724
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,220
但既然你來了
But now you're here.

725
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,190
你現在也知道了
And now you know.

726
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,200
我來是因為我覺得應該這么做
I came because I thought it was the right thing.

727
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,190
我以為  你希望我來
I thought -- I don't know -- that you'd want me to.

728
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,760
但我想我只會讓你分心
But I guess that I'm more of a distraction.

729
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,940
所以...
So, uh... ‭

730
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,050
我會在城里待上幾天
I'm gonna be in town for a few days,

731
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,420
我很想和你聚聚
and I would love ‭to spend some time with you.

732
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,420
但現在  我還是先走吧
But right now, I-I think I should go.

733
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,630
不不  拜托  我希望你留下來
No. No, no, please. I want you to stay.

734
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,280
真的嗎  你見到我好像不太開心
Really? ‭You don't seem happy to see me.

735
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,360
我很開心
I am.

736
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,380
只是有些意外  僅此而已
Just surprised, that's all.

737
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,140
請你留下來
Please, stay.

738
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,520
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

739
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,950
我確定
Yes, I'm sure.

740
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,940
你聽信了很多讒言  麗貝卡
You've been sold a bill of goods, Rebecca.

741
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,640
我希望你親眼看到事實的真相
I want you to see what's what.

742
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,680
她和我想象的不一樣
She's not what I expected.

743
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,260
是嗎  你本來以為她什么樣
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

744
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,990
我不知道  只是...
I don't know. Just...

745
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,420
不是這樣
not her.

746
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,020
這事完了后  她會恨你的
You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.

747
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,860
是啊
Yep.

748
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,200
好了  麥吉爾先生
All right, uh, Mr. McGill,

749
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,320
我提醒一下  你要遵從誓言
I'll remind you ‭you're still under oath.

750
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,360
我明白
I understand.

751
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,390
這次
At this time,

752
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,000
我想由我的合伙律師對證人進行盤問
I'd like to turn cross-examination over to my co-counsel,

753
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,120
詹姆斯·麥吉爾
James McGill.

754
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,100
這段期間發生了很多爭論
Uh, well, there's been a lot of fuss about it,

755
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,500
但你我從未談過你錄制的這盤錄音帶
but you and I have never really talked about this tape you made.

756
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,130
你闖入我家毀壞帶子后  我們就沒機會談了
We lost the opportunity when you burglarized my house to destroy it.

757
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,820
有道理
Fair enough.

758
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,550
那件事是我不對
Um, and I was in the wrong there.

759
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,590
但我還是想聽聽你錄制那盤帶子的
But, still, I'd like to try and follow your story

760
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,540
原因和方法
of why and how you recorded it.

761
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,840
你想說帶子是偽造的嗎
Is this where you claim the tape is spurious?

762
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,570
其實不是你的聲音嗎
That it's not really your voice?

763
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,620
不  那是我的聲音
No. That's me on the tape.

764
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,000
但我仍然有些疑問
But, still, I have some questions.

765
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,750
比如那臺錄音機
Like, the recorder,

766
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,080
你碰到它一定非常疼吧
it must've hurt like hell for you to touch that.

767
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,190
的確有一定程度上的不舒服
There was a degree ‭of discomfort, that's true.

768
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,550
你當時把錄音機藏在哪兒
And where did you hide it?

769
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,920
錄到的聲音很清晰
I mean, the sound's pretty clear,

770
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,340
所以應該不是藏在沙發墊子里吧
so it wasn't in ‭the couch cushions, was it?

771
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,960
壓在太空毯底下  看不見
Tucked under a space blanket. Out of sight.

772
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,780
所以我肯定不會發現
So there's no chance I would see it.

773
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,300
以你家當時的情況來說
Not with the state your place was in.

774
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,240
-對嗎  -我想是吧
- Isn't that right? ‭- I suppose.

775
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,980
你能否向紀律委員會描述當時的情況
Would you like to set the scene for the Disciplinary Committee?

776
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,040
告訴他們  錄音時
Tell them, you know, what your house looked like

777
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,430
你房子是什么樣
at the time of the recording.

778
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,790
反對  與本案有關嗎
Objection. Relevance?

779
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,280
錄音時的環境與本案有極大關系
Well, the circumstances of the recording are materially relevant.

780
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,980
如果不知道錄音時發生的事
How can you know what the tape really means

781
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,760
又怎能知道帶子的真正意義呢
unless you know what was going on when it was recorded?

782
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,140
反對無效  證人請回答問題
Overruled. The witness can answer the question.

783
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,120
我用錫箔  麻布和牛皮紙做的絕緣層蓋住大部分墻
I covered most of the walls with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.

784
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,770
我還掛上了一些太空毯
I also hung a number of space blankets.

785
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,170
是密實的聚酯薄膜
Compact Mylar sheets.

786
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,370
它們可以幫我隔離
They insulate and protect

787
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,200
輕度電磁輻射
against mild ‭electromagnetic radiation.

788
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,360
所以墻上和天花板上
All right, so, shiny insulation

789
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,460
掛滿了閃亮的隔離層和太空毯
and space blankets all over the walls and the ceiling.

790
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,950
好像在舞廳的發光球燈里一樣
It was like being inside of a disco ball.

791
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,340
你到底想說什么
Do you have a point?

792
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,300
我是驚嘆
Well, I'm impressed

793
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,790
你為了讓我落入陷阱  做了那么多工作
by how much work went into entrapping me.

794
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,990
你真是竭盡全力啊
You went all out.

795
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,300
我沒有設陷阱
I didn't entrap you.

796
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,200
我只是刺激你承認了而已
I provoked an admission in adverse interest.

797
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,910
那不是一回事
That's not the same thing.

798
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,030
你怎么知道能成功
How did you know it would work?

799
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,760
什么意思
What do you mean?

800
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,930
你怎么知道你"刺激"我能成功
How did you know your "provocation" would work?

801
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,330
你為什么覺得一些發光的塑料
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic

802
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,780
能讓我開口
would make me say anything?

803
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,790
難道不是因為你知道
Isn't it because you knew that it was precisely the thing

804
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,100
那種東西最讓我擔心
that would worry me so much

805
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,440
為了駁倒你  我什么話都說得出來
that I'd say anything to talk you down?

806
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,510
反對
Objection.

807
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,030
好的  撤回
Okay. Withdrawn.

808
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,340
我們繼續說你的房子
Let's -- Let's get back to your house,

809
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,360
所有表面都用錫箔紙蓋起來了
every surface covered in tinfoil.

810
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,510
那可一點都不瘋癲  是吧
Nothing crazy about that, huh?

811
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,780
如我所說  我把病情夸大了
As I've said, ‭I was playing up my condition.

812
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,370
通常  我的房子完全正常
Usually, it's ‭a perfectly normal house.

813
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,680
你認為你的房子很正常嗎
You think your house is normal?

814
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,690
我能請您看看九號證物嗎
Can I call your attention to Exhibit Nine?

815
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,800
這是你家  對嗎
This is your house, right?

816
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,060
是的
Yes.

817
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,880
電線外露
So, exposed wires.

818
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,270
有個便攜爐
There's a camp stove.

819
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,570
報紙上放著一盞煤油燈
There's a lantern on top of newspapers.

820
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,880
這算正常嗎
You call this normal?

821
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,310
我稱之為適應
I call them adaptations.

822
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,700
針對身體疾病做出的預防措施
A prophylactic measure for a physical, medical condition.

823
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,660
授予我對你的監護權的那位醫生
Did the doctor who granted me Guardianship

824
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,550
認為這是身體疾病嗎
for you think this was a physical condition?

825
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,630
反對
Objection.

826
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,950
不能將其作為證據
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

827
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,670
而且  陪審團已經裁決
Besides which, the panel has already ruled

828
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,270
麥吉爾先生的心理健康不在討論范疇
that Mr. McGill's mental health is not at issue.

829
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,120
不  州律師協會直接通過裁決
No, the State Bar opened the door to this on direct

830
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,200
是因為證人當時談及他"夸大"了的病情
when the witness talked about his supposed "play-acting."

831
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,290
所以讓我繼續提問很合理
Allowing me to follow up on cross is only reasonable.

832
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,670
我們當時討論的是身體過敏病癥
We discussed the physical allergy,

833
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,110
而不是精神疾病
not a mental disability.

834
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,040
說法不同而已
Potato, po-tah-to.

835
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,740
歸根結底
It comes down to this --

836
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,330
想理解我當時的想法
In order to understand what I was thinking,

837
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,900
你就要從我的視角看查克
you need to see Chuck through my eyes.

838
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,630
你得知道我當時是否覺得那盤帶子是證據
You need to know if I believed that tape was evidence.

839
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,170
而我認為這盤帶子只證明了一件事
And I say it was evidence of only one thing --

840
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,970
我哥哥恨我
My brother hates me.

841
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,010
他聲稱他欺騙我  是為了讓我說出真相
Now, he claims that he lied to me to get me to tell the truth.

842
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,330
我告訴您
And I'm telling you

843
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,050
我欺騙我哥哥  是為了讓他好過一些
I lied to my brother to make him feel better.

844
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,640
您相信誰的話
Which of us you believe

845
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,870
取決于我們如何理解查爾斯·麥吉爾的思維方式
depends on how we all understand the mind of Charles McGill.

846
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,110
我們確實答應給辯方一些自由度
Well, we did promise the defense some leeway.

847
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,470
你可以繼續說
You may proceed.

848
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,760
-謝謝  主席先生  -但你注意點
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - But watch yourself.

849
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,420
查克  我想談談更久之前的事
Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further,

850
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,590
這些癥狀剛出現那時
talk about when these symptoms first started.

851
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,390
是在你剛離婚后不久  對嗎
It was shortly after you were divorced, is that right?

852
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,340
是的
Yes.

853
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,480
你覺得離婚的壓力是你的病因嗎
You think the stress of the divorce brought on the illness?

854
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,910
應該不是  我們當時是和平分手
I doubt it. ‭It was an amicable split.

855
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,350
我前妻和我仍然相處愉快
My ex-wife and I are still on good terms.

856
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,720
事實上  你前妻今天也在現場  對嗎
In fact, your ex-wife is present with us today, is she not?

857
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,430
你們上一次見面是什么時候
When was the last time you two saw each other?

858
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,620
反對  這里不是家事法庭
Objection. This is not family court.

859
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,260
我們在此不是為證人的離婚重新提起訴訟
We're not here to re-litigate the witness' divorce.

860
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,050
我不懂問這些有什么意義
I can't see what purpose this serves.

861
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,030
我懂
I can.

862
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,720
讓我來告訴你  我弟弟為什么
I'll tell you why my brother

863
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,070
邀我前妻出席這場聽證會
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

864
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,680
她因為關心我  跨越六千四百公里來到這里
4,000 miles she came, lured by concern for me.

865
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,480
吉米想提出的是  我上次見她時
What Jimmy's driving at is the last time I saw her,

866
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,340
隱瞞了我的病情
I covered up my illness.

867
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,740
當時我已經受病情折磨了一段時間
I'd been suffering from it for some time,

868
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,140
但我想盡辦法對她隱瞞了事實
but I went to great lengths to conceal that fact from her.

869
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,080
很抱歉我欺騙了你  麗貝卡
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

870
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,410
我不希望你看輕我
I didn't want you to think less of me.

871
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,000
現在吉米當著你的面  揭穿我的秘密
Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.

872
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,600
你知道為什么嗎
You know why?

873
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,600
想亂我陣腳
To rattle me.

874
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,760
他知道我仍然對...
He knows I still have a...

875
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,700
我的前妻還存有深厚感情
lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.

876
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,220
他想以此擊垮我
He's hoping ‭this will break me down.

877
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,090
在我的傷口上撒鹽
Split me apart at the seams,

878
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,450
就像《梅森探案集》里兇手供認那樣
like a murderer confessing on an episode of "Perry Mason."

879
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,120
抱歉讓你失望了  吉米
Well, I'm sorry ‭to disappoint you, Jimmy.

880
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,140
我的回答是否使你滿意呢
Have I answered your questions to your satisfaction?

881
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,540
還有其他問題嗎
Do you have anything else?

882
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,910
是的  我有
Yeah, I do.

883
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,020
之前  你說還有其他疾病
Earlier, you talked about other diseases.

884
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,090
像你說的身體疾病
Physical conditions, you said.

885
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,180
那么  如果你當時患有...
So, okay, if you'd had, um -- I don't know --

886
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,850
肺癌  你會告訴麗貝卡嗎
lung cancer, would you have told Rebecca then?

887
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,100
真是那樣的話  也許吧
If that had been the case, maybe.

888
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,970
我也許會那么做
I might have.

889
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,300
有什么不同嗎
So how is this different?

890
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,110
麥吉爾先生  請跳過
Mr. McGill. Move it along.

891
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,740
你不用回答這個問題
You don't have to answer that.

892
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,160
我想談論實質性問題
I want to get down to brass tacks.

893
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,570
我想聽非常詳細的細節
I want to be very, very specific here.

894
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,210
得這種病  是什么感覺
This illness, what does it feel like?

895
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,960
你說過它令人很痛苦
You mentioned it's painful.

896
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,900
沒錯
It is.

897
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,980
它使我胸悶氣急  呼吸困難
There's a tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing,

898
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,050
令我感受到萬箭穿心的痛苦
and pain, burning pain.

899
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,040
這種痛苦吞噬了我
The pain spreads everywhere.

900
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,550
聽上去很可怕  現在還痛嗎
Sounds horrible. Does it hurt right now?

901
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,670
沒錯  還是會讓我感到不適
There's always some discomfort, yes.

902
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,210
現代社會離不開電力的使用
Electricity is everywhere in the modern world.

903
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,480
但我很感謝今天陪審會給予我的
But I very much appreciate the indulgence of the panel

904
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
理解和通融
for their accommodation here today.

905
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
我可以克服
I can handle this fine.

906
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,250
所以關了燈  你就感覺不到了
Right, so, with the lights out, you don't feel them?

907
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,040
如果沒有電流  就感覺不到
If the current's not flowing, no.

908
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,740
抱歉沒關安全出口燈
Oh. Sorry about the exit signs.

909
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,930
我想他們不能替你關掉
I guess they couldn't kill those for you.

910
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,710
它沒有接通太多電流  并且離我很遠
Well, they're not drawing much current, and they're far away.

911
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,580
按平方反比定律來說
Intensity drops off with distance,

912
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,350
強度會隨著距離增加而縮減
per the inverse-square law.

913
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,210
行  很強
Okay, whoa!

914
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,890
平方反比...  我不是物理學家
Inverse-square -- I'm not a physicist.

915
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,440
你能不用那么學術的詞語嗎
Could you dumb that down a shade for me?

916
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,610
距離越遠
The farther away it is,

917
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,890
就需要越強大的來源來產生效應
the stronger the source needs to be to have an effect.

918
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,810
明白了  懂了
Got it. Got it.

919
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,830
如果我有一塊小電池  比如手表的那種
So, if I had a small battery, say, from a watch or something,

920
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,590
然后拿著它靠近你  碰到你的皮膚
and I got it close to you, close to your skin,

921
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,580
你會有感覺嗎
you'd know?

922
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,140
是的  我會感覺到
I would feel it, yes.

923
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,140
你現在能察覺到
Can you feel more current

924
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,830
從其他方向傳來的電流嗎
coming from any particular direction right now?

925
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,470
比如那堵墻后面
Uh, from that back wall

926
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,000
或者那邊
or, uh, from over there

927
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,780
或者從地板上
or up through the floor?

928
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,300
你能告訴我們現在離你最近的電源在哪嗎
Can you tell us where the nearest source is right now?

929
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,180
吉米  你口袋里是不是有什么東西
Jimmy, do you have something in your pocket?

930
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,210
是的  實際上我有
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

931
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,860
是我的手機
My cellphone.

932
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,170
你應該能從這個距離察覺到
From this distance, you should feel it,

933
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,850
但你沒有  是吧
and you don't, do you?

934
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,390
麥吉爾先生  你應該把電子設備放在外面
Mr. McGill, you were warned to leave your electronics outside.

935
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,950
沒關系
It's all right.

936
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,820
沒關系
It's all right.

937
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,780
我可以看看嗎
May I?

938
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,250
正如我所想的那樣  這里面沒裝電池
Just as I thought. ‭There's no battery in here.

939
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,220
你把電池拆下來了
You removed the battery.

940
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,790
真是個遺憾的小把戲  是吧
That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?

941
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,230
是的  被你當場發現了  查克
Yeah, you got me, Chuck. Dead to rights.

942
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,410
我卸掉了電池
I removed the battery.

943
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,560
-反對  -反對有效
- Objection. - Sustained.

944
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,530
你已經問的差不多了  麥吉爾先生
Y-You've taken all the leeway you're getting, Mr. McGill.

945
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,060
趕緊收尾
Wrap it up fast.

946
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,260
天  吉米
God, Jimmy.

947
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,240
你現在還不相信這是真的嗎
Don't you know by now this is real?

948
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,600
我能感覺電流
I feel this.

949
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,030
這是對外部刺激的物理反應
It's a physical response to stimuli.

950
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,810
這不是什么怪癖
It's not a quirk.

951
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,220
我到底要怎么做才能向你證明
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

952
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,330
我不知道  查克
I don't know, Chuck.

953
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,820
你能伸進你胸前的口袋
Could you reach into your breast pocket

954
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,460
告訴我里面有什么嗎
and tell me what's there?

955
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,570
又是什么把戲
What now?

956
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,510
你能告訴法官那是什么嗎
Can you tell the court what that was?

957
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,870
-一塊電池 -董事長先生...
- A battery. - Mr. Chairman --

958
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,560
-拜托  -你認識后面那位先生嗎
- Please. - Do you recognize that man in back?

959
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,130
他叫休·巴布諾  他是我的證人
His name is Huell Babineaux. He's on our witness list.

960
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,870
你在樓梯上撞到了他
You bumped into him in the stairway.

961
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:19,080
他作證在一個半小時前放了這塊滿電量的
He'll testify he planted this fully charged battery on you

962
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,940
電池在你身上
over an hour and a half ago.

963
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,320
一小時四十三分鐘
Hour and 43 minutes ago.

964
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,590
一小時四十三分鐘  謝謝  巴布諾先生
An hour and 43 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Babineaux.

965
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,610
而你卻毫無察覺
And you felt nothing.

966
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,560
不不不
No, no, no. No, no.

967
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,290
這是個把戲  它必須...
It's a trick. It has to --

968
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,360
適可而止吧
Enough is enough.

969
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,650
我認為麥吉爾先生的精神疾病不是問題
I submit that Mr. McGill's mental illness is a non-issue.

970
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,430
-即使他有精神分裂  -精神分...
- If he were schizophrenic... - Schizo--

971
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,190
也不能抹滅被告之前所...
...it wouldn't take away from the fact that the defendant

972
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,830
我不是瘋子
I am not crazy!

973
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,660
我不是瘋子
I am not crazy.

974
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,450
我知道他調換了號碼
I know he swapped those numbers.

975
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,680
我知道是1216號
I knew it was 1216.

976
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,010
和《大憲章》簽署日一數之差
One after Magna Carta.

977
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,940
我怎么可能犯這種錯誤
As if I could ever make such a mistake.

978
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,760
絕對不會
Never. Never!

979
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,830
我就是...  就是沒辦法證明
I just -- I just couldn't prove it.

980
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,740
他掩蓋了自己的行蹤
H-H-He covered his tracks.

981
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,560
他還讓復印店的傻蛋幫他撒謊
He got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him.

982
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,320
麥吉爾先生  你不用...
Mr. McGill, please. You don't have to go in--

983
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,450
你們覺得這很大不了嗎
You think this is something?

984
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,480
你們覺得這種欺詐很惡劣嗎
You think this is bad, this -- this chicanery?

985
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,450
他還干過更壞的事  那個廣告牌
He's done worse. That billboard!

986
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,260
你是說那個男的就那么恰好掉下去了
Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that?

987
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,320
不  他一手策劃的
No. He orchestrated it!

988
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,300
吉米
Jimmy!

989
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,670
他對著天窗拉了泡屎
He defecated through a sunroof!

990
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,750
是我拯救了他  但我后悔了
And I saved him, and I shouldn't have.

991
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,070
我把他帶進了自己的律所
I took him into my own firm.

992
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,860
我當時想什么呢
What was I thinking?!

993
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,800
他就是不肯改變
He'll never change.

994
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:30,620
死不悔改
He'll never change.

995
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,460
從他九歲開始  他就一直這副德行
Ever since he was 9, always the same.

996
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,150
管不住自己去動收銀柜的手
Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer.

997
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,830
但咱吉米不是這種人
But not our Jimmy.

998
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,810
不可能是咱寶貴的吉米啊
Couldn't be precious Jimmy!

999
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,240
他就是偷竊成癮
Stealing them blind.

1000
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,640
而這種人卻當了一名律師
And he gets to be a lawyer?!

1001
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,360
真是見了鬼
What a sick joke!

1002
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,500
當年有機會的時候我就該阻攔他
I should have stopped him when I had the chance!

1003
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,590
你們得阻攔他
And you -- you have to stop him!

1004
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,490
你們...
You --

1005
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,650
我道歉
I apologize.

1006
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,130
我沒能穩定自己的情緒
I lost my train of thought.

1007
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,670
失去了理智
I got carried away.

1008
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,910
還有其他問題嗎
Do you have anything else?

1009
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,530
沒  我問完了
No. Nothing further.

1010
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:59,340
{\an8}安全出口
