1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,080
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:06,459
We're gonna be late!

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,329
<i>Fun fact... the first time</i>

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,209
<i>I almost died was
at the age of nine.</i>

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,579
<i>The murder weapon?</i>

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,620
<i>A Jimmy Dean sausage.</i>

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,620
Mom, Sheldon's
making faces at me.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,289
Sheldon!

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>In fairness to Mr. Dean...</i>

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,170
- Honey!
- <i>this one morning, I decided.</i>

11
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:31,039
<i>To forgo my normal
20 chews per bite,</i>

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,249
<i>as prescribed by the
American Medical Association.</i>

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,250
George, help!

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,209
Come here, boy. We got it.
We just got to smack it out.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,079
<i>To further complicate matters,</i>

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>in any reallife crisis,</i>

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,329
<i>my family's default mode
is mindless panic.</i>

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,249
Sheldon's gonna die!
Sheldon's gonna die!

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,039
<i>Or heartless apathy.</i>

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,039
Lord.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,709
Here we go.
This is how you do it.

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,895
Here we go. And we shake.

23
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,079
Honey!

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,249
<i>It's interesting
the things you think about</i>

25
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,289
<i>when life is ebbing
from your body.</i>

26
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,419
<i>For instance, linoleum.
What is it, really?</i>

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,249
<i>Plastic? And if so, how is it
different from Formica?</i>

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,499
I'm calling 911.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,419
<i>And what about Count Chocula?</i>

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,959
<i>How is he a count?</i>

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,669
<i>Did the title come with land?</i>

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,670
George, Heimlich!

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,959
Don't hurt his little ribs!

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,579
<i>They say, in the final moments,</i>

35
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,119
<i>your life passes
before your eyes.</i>

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,379
<i>All I saw was my brother
licking jelly off the knife</i>

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,040
<i>and putting it back in the jar.</i>

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,329
Okay, it's better now. Sheldon!

39
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,499
Honey. Are you okay?

40
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,249
Can you breathe? Say something!

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,250
You have to... throw
away... that jelly.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,499
I've never been late
to school before.

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,249
I'm late all the time.
It's no big deal.

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,039
I get you to school on time
every day. Why are you late?

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,379
I have a lot of people
to say hi to in the morning.

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Mom,

47
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,669
would you write a note for me?

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,289
Sure.

49
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,209
You have the coolest excuse.

50
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,829
You almost died.
Did you see Jesus?

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,579
I saw Count Chocula.

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,119
But feel free to mention
my brush with death in the note.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,119
All right, that's enough
talk about death and dying.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,380
I came this close to
having my own room.

55
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,039
<i>Remember, the food drive</i>

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,289
ends Friday.

57
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,709
All canned goods are welcome.

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,419
But please... make sure
your cans have labels.

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,419
Needy people
have enough problems

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,079
without having to guess
what's for dinner.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,710
I'm sorry I'm late.
I have a note.

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,249
You poor thing, you had
a medical emergency?

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,710
Yes, ma'am.
I choked on a sausage.

64
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,379
How big was it?

65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,670
About yay big.

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,209
<i>To this day,</i>

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,790
<i>I still don't understand
why they were laughing.</i>

68
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,079
You're sitting in my spot.

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,329
Why is it your spot?

70
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,120
It's complicated. Just move.

71
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,835
You're reading a comic book.

72
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,289
I am.

73
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,919
You do understand
those are for children.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,499
Have you ever read one?

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,539
I outgrew picture books
when I was three.

76
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,670
Just eat your lunch.

77
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,829
What's the matter?

78
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,209
II don't think I can eat this.

79
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,459
You want to trade?

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,579
My mom made me fish soup again.

81
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,539
How long do we have
to be in this country

82
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,880
before I get baloney?

83
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,539
No, thank you.

84
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,209
I'm not hungry.

85
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,379
"I'm not hungry."

86
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,579
Three words you never hear
in Vietnam.

87
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,459
Well, here's something nice.

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,419
You know that Mr. Rosenbloom

89
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,669
with the furniture store
over by the steakhouse?

90
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think so.

91
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,329
Sure you do.

92
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,329
That Hebrew fella
with the combover?

93
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,210
You mean Jewish?

94
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,789
I think they like
to be called Hebrew.

95
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,289
Anyway,

96
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,710
he's asked me to dinner.

97
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,169
Well, good for you.
What'd you say?

98
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,249
I said I'd have
to think about it.

99
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,459
What's to think about?

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,419
Well, a lot.

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,419
I mean, assuming he enjoys
dinner, he might want

102
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,079
a scoop of Meemaw for dessert.

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,579
Mom, the kids.

104
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,619
I said "dessert."

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,919
Did you know
I was talking about sex?

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,329
No.

107
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,620
See?

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,829
Why aren't you eating?

109
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,209
I don't think I can.

110
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,249
Sometimes the different foods
touch each other, Sheldon.

111
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,209
Not the end of the world.

112
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,579
No, I'm afraid I'll choke again.

113
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,579
Honey, that's not gonna happen.

114
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,619
Go ahead, eat your dinner.

115
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,289
What's all this about choking?

116
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,209
Sheldon almost died
this morning.

117
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,000
- What?!
- Yeah.

118
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:32,289
Dad was shaking him upside down
like a ketchup bottle.

119
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,829
It was great.

120
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,419
Well, you got to eat
something, baby.

121
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,380
Just have a few bites.

122
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,249
I can't. It's too risky.

123
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,749
Dibs on the tater tots.

124
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,249
All right, I'll wrap
that up for you,

125
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,999
and if you change your mind,
you can have some later.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,419
At least drink your milk.

127
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,709
Sure.

128
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,459
<i>My mother and father saw</i>

129
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,119
<i>that I'd been traumatized and
were patient and understanding</i>

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,999
<i>about my fear
of eating solid foods.</i>

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,789
<i>This lasted one more day.</i>

132
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,379
Sheldon Lee Cooper, if you don't

133
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,539
finish that pork chop,
I swear I will chew it up

134
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,329
and spit it in your mouth
like a mama bird.

135
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,919
Do it, Mom. Do it.

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,540
- Mary, can I speak to you for a second?
- No. Enough is enough.

137
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,709
The boy has got to eat.

138
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,000
Just give me a minute.

139
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,380
Start eating, mister.

140
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,330
You don't mind, right?

141
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,709
How about I cut that
pork chop off the bone

142
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,379
and throw it in the
blender with some gravy?

143
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,709
If it fits through
a bendy straw, I'll drink it.

144
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,039
Coming up.

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,709
Why does he get a pork shake?

146
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,999
This is all my fault.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I rushed him through
breakfast the other day,

148
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,999
and now look...
He is wasting away.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,999
Come on.
You can't blame yourself.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,289
This isn't gonna last. Remember
the time a bee got in the house

151
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,669
and he slept under a net
for a couple months?

152
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,829
This is different.

153
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,040
- How?
- First of all,

154
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,040
You let that bee in.

155
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,289
The bee was your fault.

156
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,620
- Okay.
- Secondly,

157
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:54,829
This is about his health.

158
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,039
He is a fragile little boy.

159
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,459
He can't go on like this.

160
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,829
I'm not arguing with you.

161
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,710
Let's just, you know,
give him a little more time.

162
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,379
Now what?

163
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,420
Sounds like your mom's
making margaritas.

164
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
What's he drinking?

165
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,539
Pork chop and gravy.

166
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,669
I snuck
some broccoli in there, too.

167
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,580
Shh...

168
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,669
I'm real glad
you've been getting out again.

169
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,289
Me, too.

170
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,959
We had a nice dinner,
took a walk.

171
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,119
He's a divorcé, you know.

172
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,209
I didn't.

173
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,079
It's not a big deal
for those people.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,119
If they're not a lawyer,
they're related to one.

175
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,169
You're actually
cutting the crust off

176
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,580
- before you blend it?
- I left it.

177
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,169
On his tuna sandwich yesterday,
he said he could tell.

178
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,999
Only drank half of it.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,249
Mary, you think this has
gone on long enough?

180
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,749
No trouble.

181
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,169
But it'd be better
if I had two blenders.

182
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,999
Be better if you stopped
coddling him.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,209
Well, I don't know
what else to do.

184
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,419
I suggested that we take him
to some kind of professional,

185
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,249
but you said he'd outgrow it.

186
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,619
Well, if you're looking
for a psychiatrist,

187
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,500
I bet my new fella's
related to one.

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
What do you think?

189
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,919
Not sure.

190
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,169
If we take him to a shrink,
it feels like we're admitting

191
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,579
something's wrong with him.

192
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,079
He hasn't had solid food
in five weeks.

193
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,789
Well, if there is
something wrong with him,

194
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,580
it ain't constipation.

195
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,379
Okay.

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,379
Let's see if we
can find somebody.

197
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,170
Thank you.

198
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,579
Needs a few more Cheetos.

199
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,579
<i>My mother managed
to locate a family psychiatrist</i>

200
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,789
<i>within our price range.</i>

201
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,749
<i>No one seemed to be bothered
that he had</i>

202
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,499
<i>a coupon in </i>The Pennysaver.

203
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,579
Is this man gonna make me
eat solid foods?

204
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,709
No, he just wants to
talk to you about it.

205
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,249
Did you tell him I have
a lot to accomplish in my life

206
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,789
and cannot afford to be killed
by an unchewed sausage?

207
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,420
Not in those exact words.

208
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,999
Did you bring the coupon?

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,999
Hi. Welcome.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,789
You must be the Cooper family.

211
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,500
We are.

212
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,039
Right on, right on.

213
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,170
This must be Sheldon.

214
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,080
Put 'er there.

215
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,289
No, thank you.

216
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,289
Right on, right on.

217
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,209
Okay, well, here's how
I'd like to start. Mom and Dad,

218
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,079
why don't you come talk to me
first, and then, Sheldon,

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,500
you and I have
a little rap session.

220
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Folks?

221
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,249
Right on, right on.

222
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,790
Feel free to read
any of my comics.

223
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,080
And you guys feel free
to sit on my beanbag!

224
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,119
40 cents? Outrageous.

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,249
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

226
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,249
<i>the comic I picked up
was called </i>XMen.

227
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,669
<i>Young mutants
with incredible powers</i>

228
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,079
<i>who were feared
and misunderstood</i>

229
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,579
<i>by the entire world.</i>

230
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,170
Hey, it's about me.

231
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,619
Now, the thing
you have to understand is

232
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,789
Shelly is incredibly bright.

233
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,289
I mean, his IQ is right up there
with Albert Einstein

234
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,039
and that English
wheelchair fella.

235
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,105
Cool.

236
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,169
He's nine years old

237
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,209
and he's in high school, so you
can't judge him like other kids.

238
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,250
- I hear ya.
- George,

239
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:48,169
Tell him about
how he's always going

240
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,119
on and on about
subatomic particles and such.

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,249
He'll get to gabbin' about it.

242
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,249
We're accustomed
to his quirks and oddities.

243
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,289
But this whole "being afraid
of solid foods" thing,

244
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,379
it's got us thrown.

245
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,999
Okay.
Let me just start by saying

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,499
you came to the right place.

247
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,499
Sheldon and I happen
to have a lot in common.

248
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,079
I, too, was
a special little boy.

249
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,789
In the fourth grade,
I was reading

250
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,209
at a seventh grade level.

251
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,209
And I don't have to tell you
where I was

252
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,790
by the seventh grade.

253
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,290
Tenth.

254
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,080
I'm gonna give
the beanbag a whirl.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,289
What are y'all watching?

256
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,460
<i>Little Rascals.</i>

257
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,329
You know most of those kids
are dead, right?

258
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,459
What?

259
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,669
Alfalfa, Stymie, Buckwheat.

260
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,079
Even Petey the dog?

261
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,249
Especially Petey the dog.

262
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,249
Thanks for making it depressing.

263
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,329
You're very welcome.

264
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,169
Y'all want to go get
some ice cream?

265
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,170
What about dinner?

266
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,079
What about it? Come on.

267
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,249
Is ALF dead?

268
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,669
No, but it's just
a matter of time.

269
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,999
You'd be surprised how many
children have food phobias.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,170
- Is that so?
- Yeah. When I was Sheldon's age,

271
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,249
I was afraid of that weird skin

272
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,880
- on top of puddin'.
- Really?

273
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:09,579
Me, too. You know, you put
a little Saran Wrap on...

274
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,330
George.

275
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,999
Sheldon?

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,380
Where the hell did he go?

277
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,379
Sheldon?

278
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,039
Couldn't have gone far.

279
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,169
Why not?

280
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,250
Right on, right on.

281
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,959
I checked the bathroom,
the stairs.

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,119
He's not in the building.

283
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,209
I'm worried.
No one's answering at home.

284
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,329
Stay calm. We'll find him.

285
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,210
You know,

286
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,619
when I was a kid...

287
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,169
Shut up.

288
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,540
Well...

289
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,289
<i>It wasn't typical
for me to wander out into</i>

290
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,039
<i>the urban jungle on my own,
but I was on a mission.</i>

291
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,879
<i>I had gotten my first taste
of serialized superheroes,</i>

292
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,540
<i>and I needed more.</i>

293
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,789
Excuse me,
do you have <i>XMen </i>♪137?

294
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,619
I'd like to know
what happens next, please.

295
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,880
Back bin in the corner.

296
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,879
What are you doing here?

297
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,499
Hello, Tam.

298
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,789
I thought you said
comic books are for children.

299
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,790
I'm a complicated young man.

300
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,789
I think we should
call the police.

301
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,789
We don't need the police.
We'll find him.

302
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,379
This is all my fault.

303
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,619
He ran away because
we took him to a therapist.

304
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,829
That's $15 we ain't
getting back.

305
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,789
That's what you're
worried about?

306
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,790
No. Course not.

307
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,789
And Sheldon's fine.

308
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,789
You know what he's like.

309
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,209
If someone took him,

310
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,210
I'm sure
they'll bring him right back.

311
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,829
I'm enjoying this,
but I'm having trouble

312
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,249
with the onomatopoeia.

313
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,379
The what?

314
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,829
The onomatopoeia.

315
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,959
Words that imitate sounds.

316
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,579
"Kthoom." "Snikt."

317
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,879
"Bamf."

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,829
Writers shouldn't make up words.

319
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,790
Somebody made up "onomatopoeia."

320
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,540
You challenge me. I like that.

321
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,329
Meemaw, are you gonna have
any more babies?

322
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,039
Good Lord, no!

323
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,879
She's too old
to have any more babies.

324
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,079
Don't have to have 'em.
You live long enough,

325
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,879
your hair and your teeth
start falling out,

326
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,499
you start wetting the bed,
you get to be one.

327
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,619
That's funny.

328
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,329
We're gonna have to
put a diaper on you.

329
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,669
You won't be laughing
when you're doing it.

330
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,540
I might be.

331
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,749
Hey, Meemaw, next to Sheldon,
who's smarter, me or Georgie?

332
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,459
Me, of course.

333
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,669
Why you?

334
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,249
My head's bigger.

335
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,829
It doesn't matter.

336
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,789
Tonight is not about Sheldon.

337
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,999
Yeah, right. Everything's
always about Sheldon.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,829
Yeah. Most of the time,

339
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,829
it's like we don't even exist.

340
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,379
I guess Sheldon does get
most of the attention.

341
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,539
Maybe that's a good thing.

342
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,829
How?

343
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,579
Well, if it weren't for him,
your parents would be

344
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,039
on <i>your </i>ass all the time.

345
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,209
Yeah. I guess I never thought
about it that way before.

346
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,959
You kidding me? Right now,
they would be nagging you

347
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,169
about cleaning your room

348
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,419
and doing your homework.

349
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,709
Instead, you're sitting
in a parking lot,

350
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,419
eating a Blizzard for dinner.

351
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,565
With cookie dough in it.

352
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,709
Exactly.

353
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,829
While Sheldon is stuck sitting
in some boring shrink's office.

354
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,580
Mom told me they were
taking him for a haircut.

355
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,249
Yeah.

356
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,329
Right.

357
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, when he gets home,
say his hair looks good.

358
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
What?

359
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,420
Nothing.

360
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,539
You want one?

361
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,419
No.

362
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,419
Well...

363
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,670
if you change your mind,
help yourself.

364
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,289
<i>I didn't
have to read many comic books</i>

365
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>to understand that
every superhero had a weakness,</i>

366
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,459
<i>something they had to overcome</i>

367
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,710
<i>through an extraordinary act
of courage.</i>

368
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,419
<i>For Cyclops,
it was the loss of Jean Grey.</i>

369
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,959
<i>For Rogue, it was human touch.</i>

370
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,829
<i>For me, it was food
that required chewing.</i>

371
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,170
<i>So if I truly was a mutant,
I would have to do the same.</i>

372
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>On this day,
I would not be defeated.</i>

373
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,920
<i>Because this was
the day I became...</i>

374
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,709
<i>The Chewer.</i>

375
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,709
<i>Just like that,
I overcame my fear of choking.</i>

376
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,579
<i>All that was left
was my fear of dogs,</i>

377
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,619
<i>birds, insects, germs,</i>

378
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,619
<i>hugging, button fly pants,</i>

379
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,619
<i>rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans,</i>

380
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,669
<i>estuaries, corduroy,
root vegetables,</i>

381
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,419
<i>squeaky balloons,
tinted windows,</i>

382
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,789
<i>take a penny, leave a penny,
fireworks,</i>

383
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,789
<i>potbelly stoves, dust bunnies,</i>

384
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,000
<i>that fuzz on peaches.</i>

385
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,579
What I find interesting
is how many supervillains.

386
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,959
Doctor Octopus,

387
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,579
Doctor Doom, Lex Luthor,

388
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,579
Green Goblin,
the list goes on and on.

389
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
So?

390
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:10,749
So if the world
doesn't respect me,

391
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,330
I might change sides.

392
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,330
Good luck.

393
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,459
<i>I tried to explain to my parents</i>

394
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,079
<i>that a mutant named Cyclops,</i>

395
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,249
<i>who shoots laser beams
out of his eyes,</i>

396
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,329
<i>helped me eat a licorice stick.</i>

397
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,960
<i>Went right over their heads.</i>
