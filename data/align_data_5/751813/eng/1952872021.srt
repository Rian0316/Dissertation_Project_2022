1
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:47,890
- Are you sure Hacker's the man for this?
- Yes.

2
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:52,012
He's the best choice to bring in
an integrated transport policy?!

3
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,609
- Yes.
- But he knows nothing about it!

4
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,604
No.

5
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:01,765
- You've sounded out the Transport Secretary?
- He won't touch it.

6
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:07,132
- Yes. This could turn out to be a bed of nails.
- A crown of thorns.

7
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:12,288
- A booby trap.
- It has to look like something's going to be done.

8
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:18,650
It calls for a particular combination of talents,
lots of activity but no actual achievement.

9
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:22,368
I see.

10
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:25,047
Then Hacker IS the man!

11
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,364
So how do we go about him?

12
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:31,083
Well, you're the PM's Chief
Special Advisor. You know the form.

13
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:35,248
We make it seem like a special
honour. A promotion. A present.

14
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:38,725
But Sir Humphrey will tell
Hacker he'd be crazy to do it.

15
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:43,841
Yes. "Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes," I can hear him say.

16
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,530
"Beware of Greeks bearing
gifts," roughly translated.

17
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:53,213
Humphrey would have put it in English for
Hacker's benefit. Hacker went to the LSE.

18
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:58,208
- So did I.
- Oh, I AM sorry.

19
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:04,409
We must get an immediate commitment
from Hacker before he talks to Humphrey.

20
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,725
- Today? Now?
- Don't you think it'll work?

21
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,887
Flattering a politician?
When's it ever failed?

22
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:16,413
We'll offer to call him
Transport Supremo, shall we?

23
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:20,408
Yes, much more attractive
than Transport Muggins!

24
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,936
Ah, Jim!

25
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,525
Hello, Mark.

26
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,405
- Arnold.
- Drink?

27
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,486
Yes, thank you.

28
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:42,927
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

29
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:49,169
We wanted... Er, that is, the Prime
Minister wanted the Cabinet Secretary and me

30
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:51,641
to sound you out about something...

31
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,850
...something of an honour, I may say.

32
00:02:55,014 --> 00:03:01,361
- Honour? You don't mean... kicked up there?
- No, no. A real honour.

33
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,525
A significant increase of responsibility.

34
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:09,449
Now, what are your views on the
Integrated National Transport Policy?

35
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:11,650
Er... I... I...

36
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,368
Well, er... I...

37
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,846
Go on.

38
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:22,092
The PM has decided we need
a national transport policy.

39
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:25,293
Yes. Well. Why not?

40
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,204
You're in favour?

41
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:39,686
Unfortunately, public dissatisfaction
with the nationalised transport industries

42
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:44,168
is now at a high enough level to
worry the government, as you know.

43
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,168
Can you go on?

44
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:53,771
- No, we can't go on, not like this.
- We need a policy.

45
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:59,132
Not just blame the management if there's an R
in the month and the unions the rest of the time.

46
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:03,811
Unfortunately, they've got together.
Their line is it's the government's fault.

47
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:08,253
Everything that goes wrong is the result
of not having an integrated policy.

48
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,689
- We did have a policy before.
- Did we?

49
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,846
Yes, it was our policy
not to have a policy.

50
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,243
Well, now the PM wants a positive policy.

51
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,323
Oh, the PM. Yes, well, er...

52
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:26,770
- I couldn't agree more. I've always thought so.
- Good.

53
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,529
Surely it's a Ministry
of Transport matter?

54
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,046
No.

55
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:36,207
Obviously the Transport Secretary would
love the job, but he's too close to it all.

56
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:40,252
- Can't see the wood for the trees.
- It needs an open mind, uncluttered.

57
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:45,247
So the PM has decided to appoint a supremo

58
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:49,328
to develop and implement a
national transport policy.

59
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:52,453
- Supremo?
- A supremo.

60
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:54,012
And...

61
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,890
Exactly.

62
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:03,685
- It was agreed you had the most open mind.
- And the most uncluttered.

63
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:08,493
Of course it's a great
honour and a responsibility.

64
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:13,850
Er, but what... What
sort of... Er... I mean...

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,087
You mean what is required of an
integrated transport policy minister?

66
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:22,328
- It's to help the consumer.
- Very popular with the public.

67
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,283
- Not that that would...
- No, of course not. It's my duty.

68
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:30,413
For example, the motorways were planned
without reference to the railways,

69
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:35,409
so there are great stretches of motorway
running alongside already existing railways.

70
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:39,806
- While other areas aren't served at all.
- Quite. We knew you'd understand.

71
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,887
- It's really quite simple.
- Yes.

72
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,931
- Then there's through tickets.
- Through tickets...?

73
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,127
If you want to commute
from Henley to the City,

74
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:55,605
you need one British Rail ticket to Paddington
and then an Underground ticket to the Bank.

75
00:05:55,775 --> 00:06:00,288
Have you ever seen a combined
bus and railway timetable?

76
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,413
Or ever seen a bus timetable
in a railway station?

77
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:06,533
Has a bus driver ever
seen a bus timetable?

78
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:14,812
There's a British Rail Western Region line
running less than a mile north of Heathrow,

79
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,806
but no link line.

80
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,092
Bus and train services don't
connect, all over London.

81
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:26,123
- And outside London there are problems.
- Probably. But we don't know about them.

82
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:32,971
It's full of possibilities. I suppose you'd like
me to discuss it with Humphrey and come back?

83
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:39,529
There is much to discuss with Sir Humphrey,
but we need an indication of your response now.

84
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:44,243
The PM's car leaves for the airport
in 30 minutes. The Ottowa conference.

85
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:47,962
- Then the United Nations speech in New York.
- Then Washington.

86
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:52,605
Gosh, what a long trip. Who's
going to run the country?

87
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,084
Sorry, Arnold. Silly question.

88
00:06:56,051 --> 00:07:00,012
- So we can give the PM the good news?
- There's a lot to put in hand.

89
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:04,882
- Oh, yes. I'm on.
- Splendid! Have another drink.

90
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,173
- Ah, Minister.
- Sorry I'm late.

91
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:13,404
- Got some splendid news.
- Indeed, Minister?

92
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:17,123
- I have a new job.
- The department will be sorry to lose you.

93
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,404
No, I mean an extra job.

94
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:25,726
I've been asked to develop an integrated
national transport policy by the Prime Minister.

95
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,614
I see. And what was the good news?

96
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,324
That WAS the good news.

97
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:37,167
Oh. Then how, if I may
be so bold as to enquire,

98
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,609
- would you describe bad news?
- What?

99
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,288
Do you realise what this job
would mean if you accept it?

100
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,525
- I have accepted it.
- You've what?

101
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:51,212
- I HAVE accepted it.
- Minister, you're not serious!

102
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:54,409
Yes, it's an honour. We
need a transport policy.

103
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,167
If by "we" you mean
Britain, that's quite true.

104
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,641
But if by "we" you mean this department,

105
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:04,092
we need a transport policy like
an aperture in the cranial cavity!

106
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,685
It is a bed of nails!

107
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:11,770
- I know it may cause extra administrative duties.
- Minister, that is not the point.

108
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:15,007
The reason there's no
integrated transport policy

109
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:19,248
is that it's in everybody's interest
except the minister who creates it.

110
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,324
Why?

111
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:25,690
How can I put it in a manner
which is close to your heart?

112
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,529
- It is the ultimate vote loser.
- Vote loser?

113
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,002
Why do you think the Transport
Secretary isn't doing it?

114
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,562
Why did he suggest the Lord Privy Seal?

115
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:41,173
Why did the Lord Privy Seal suggest the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,

116
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,770
- who suggested the President of the Council?
- I didn't know this.

117
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:48,687
And why did they invite you
to No. 10 behind my back?

118
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:54,404
Minister, this hideous appointment has been
hurtling round Whitehall for three weeks

119
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,882
like a grenade with the pin taken out!

120
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,882
If I pull it off, it'll
be a feather in my cap.

121
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,932
If you pull it off, Minister,
it won't be in your cap any more.

122
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:09,962
Thank you, Bernard. If you pull it off, no
one will feel the benefits for ten years.

123
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,810
- Long before that, you and I will have moved on.
- Or up.

124
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,365
- Or out.
- Out?

125
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:20,244
In the meantime, formulating
policy means making choices.

126
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:25,490
Once you do that, you please the people that
you favour, but infuriate everybody else.

127
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:28,168
One vote gained, ten lost.

128
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:33,203
If you give the job to the road services,
the rail board and unions will scream.

129
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:36,605
Give it to the railways, the
road lobby will massacre you.

130
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:42,132
Cut British Airways investment plans, they'll
hold a devastating press conference that same day.

131
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,525
But I'm going to be Transport Supremo!

132
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:50,846
I believe the Civil Service
vernacular is Transport Muggins!

133
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:57,490
No, the Prime Minister has asked me to
undertake this task, this necessary duty.

134
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:01,091
After all, we must all
endeavour to do our duty.

135
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,927
Furthermore, Sir Mark thinks
there may be votes in it.

136
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:10,691
- I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.
- You're looking a Trojan horse in the mouth!

137
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:14,735
If we look closely at this gift
horse we'll find it full of Trojans?

138
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:19,886
If you'd looked a Trojan horse in the
mouth, you'd have found Greeks inside.

139
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,048
It was the Greeks who gave the
Trojan horse to the Trojans.

140
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:27,650
Technically, it wasn't a
Trojan horse but a Greek horse.

141
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:31,524
Hence the tag "Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes," which, you'll recall,

142
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:36,208
is usually and somewhat inaccurately
translated, "Beware Greeks bearing gifts,"

143
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:40,252
or doubtless you would have recalled
had you not attended the LSE.

144
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,449
Greek tags are all very well,
but can we stick to the point?

145
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,761
- Yes...
- Sorry, Greek tags?

146
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,288
"Beware Greeks bearing gifts."

147
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:55,404
The EEC equivalent would be, "Beware
Greeks bearing an olive oil surplus"!

148
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:58,610
- Excellent.
- No, the point is, Minister,

149
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:03,087
just as the Trojan horse was Greek, what
you call a Greek tag is, in fact, Latin.

150
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:08,485
The Greeks wouldn't suggest bewaring of
themselves, if one can use such a participle,

151
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:14,173
and it's clearly Latin not because "Timeo" ends
in "o", as the Greek first person also ends in "o".

152
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,566
No, there is a Greek word
"Timao" meaning "I honour",

153
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:23,048
but the "os" ending is a nominative singular
termination of a second declension in Greek

154
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:25,284
and an accusative plural in Latin,

155
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:31,212
though actually Danaos is not only the Greek
for Greek, it's also the Latin for Greek.

156
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:37,453
Yes, I take your point, Humphrey,
but is it really as bad as that?

157
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:42,244
Minister, perhaps... Perhaps you
will allow me to prove it to you.

158
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,685
I will arrange a preliminary
conference for you

159
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:50,766
with three Under-Secretaries
from the Department of Transport,

160
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:55,212
- from the roads, rail and air transport divisions.
- What will that prove?

161
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:58,333
It may illustrate some
problems you will encounter.

162
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:04,365
You may be right, Humphrey. But if I
succeed, this could be my Falkland Islands.

163
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:05,967
Yes.

164
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,203
And you could be General Galtieri!

165
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:17,691
With respect, Minister, I feel constrained
to point out the proposal is deeply misguided.

166
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:21,891
- So what do you suggest?
- I suggest it should be government policy

167
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:26,127
to designate road haulage as its
principal means of freight transport.

168
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,761
If I might crave your
indulgence for a moment,

169
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:34,293
I think such a policy would be, not to put too
fine a point on it, unacceptably short-sighted.

170
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:39,244
Rail transport must surely be the favoured
carrier under any sane national policy.

171
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:44,770
With the greatest respect, both those
proposals are formulae for disaster.

172
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,529
Long-term considerations mandate
the increase of air freight.

173
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,685
If the minister wants a
massive budget increase...

174
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,244
If the minister accepts a
long, bitter rail strike...

175
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:59,966
If the minister can tolerate a
massive rise in public discontent...

176
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:01,726
Hold on!

177
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:05,490
- We are the government, aren't we?
- Indeed you are, Minister.

178
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:09,091
- So we're all on the same side.
- Indeed, no question.

179
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,083
Doing what's best for Britain.

180
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:14,485
Is the end of the air freight
business best for Britain?

181
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:18,534
How is Britain served by the
destruction of the railways?

182
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:22,529
How does Britain benefit from a
deterioration of the road network?

183
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:27,288
I want to examine policy options for
the government's freight transport needs.

184
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:33,691
I thought a preliminary discussion, a few friends
around the table, a few positive suggestions...

185
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:38,212
- An expansion of rail transport...
- An expansion of motorway construction...

186
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:43,083
- An expansion of air freight capacity.
- I need to achieve a reduction in costs.

187
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:47,610
- Then there is only one possible course.
- Indeed there is.

188
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,127
And there's no doubt what it is.

189
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:54,846
Good. I always like to end on a note
of agreement. Thank you, gentlemen.

190
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,494
Minister.

191
00:13:56,654 --> 00:14:01,168
Perhaps we could discuss a date for
our next meeting. This way, please.

192
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:05,408
That was a very frank meeting.

193
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,533
More than frank, Minister.
Frank bordering on direct.

194
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:13,369
- The cleaners will mop up the blood tomorrow.
- Bernard, can you help me?

195
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,525
- How, Minister? -
Under-Secretaries are civil servants.

196
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:21,324
But they behave like counsel briefed by the
transport interests to defeat the government.

197
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,087
- That's right.
- No, Bernard, that's wrong.

198
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:29,807
That's how it works. Each department is
controlled by the people it's supposed to control.

199
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:34,252
- How do you mean?
- Why do we have comprehensive education?

200
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,249
- Who wanted it? Pupils, parents?
- Not really.

201
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,610
The National Union of Teachers,

202
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:44,052
the chief client of the Department of
Education, so the DES went comprehensive.

203
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:48,891
Departments act for the powerful interest
with whom they have a permanent relationship.

204
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:52,203
The Department of Employment
lobbies for the TUC.

205
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:56,369
The Department of Industry lobbies
for the employers. It's a nice balance.

206
00:14:56,534 --> 00:15:01,485
Energy lobbies for oil companies, Defence for
the armed forces, the Home Office for the police.

207
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:05,726
So the system aims to stop the
Cabinet carrying out its policies?

208
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:08,124
Well, somebody's got to!

209
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:15,087
So formulating a national transport policy
means fighting not just the transport industry

210
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:18,802
but the entire Civil Service as well?

211
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:23,400
Shouldn't the Civil Service help
the government carry out its wishes?

212
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:27,453
Well, as long as the government's
wishes are practicable.

213
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:31,369
- Meaning?
- As long as the Civil Service agrees with them!

214
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,453
Useful meeting, Minister.

215
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:37,842
All right, Humphrey.

216
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:40,810
You win.

217
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,529
- What do I win?
- We must get out of our commitments.

218
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,324
Clearly the title Transport
Supremo is not worth having.

219
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:53,566
- We must change the Prime Minister's mind.
- Is that "we" plural,

220
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:57,365
or do supremos now use the royal pronoun?

221
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:02,252
I mean both of us, Humphrey, unless
you want the DAA saddled with this.

222
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:09,011
- So, what are you suggesting?
- Bernard, find a map of the PM's constituency.

223
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,168
- Humphrey, I need some advice.
- Yes, Minister?

224
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:18,203
Could the formulation of a national transport
policy have unwanted local repercussions?

225
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:22,168
Er, yes, indeed, Minister.

226
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:27,043
Even in a constituency represented by
a very senior member of the government,

227
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:31,569
- the MOST senior member of the government?
- Deeply embarrassing!

228
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:36,284
- Here's the street map and the directory.
- Splendid.

229
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:41,971
This is the Prime Minister's
constituency, isn't it? Oh, look, a park!

230
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,842
Near the station.

231
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:52,409
One requirement of a transport policy is to
bring bus stations nearer to railway stations.

232
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:55,851
- But that would mean building on the park.
- Alas, yes.

233
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,374
Somebody has to suffer
in the national interest.

234
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:04,610
Take a note, Bernard. Bus station to
be moved into Queen Charlotte's Park.

235
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:08,611
Oh, Minister, there's
a big bus repair shop.

236
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:12,325
Isn't it economic to amalgamate
the bus and train repairs?

237
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:17,012
- Absolutely. Big saving.
- Bus repair shop to be closed, Bernard.

238
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:22,646
- This is commuter country, what about that?
- Commuter trains run at a loss.

239
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:27,936
They're only really used at rush hours.
So commuters are, in effect, subsidised.

240
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:32,168
- Isn't that unfair on the others?
- It's a great injustice.

241
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,530
Commuters to pay full
economic fares, Bernard.

242
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:41,329
- Mind, that'll double the price of tickets.
- Can't make an omelette without breaking eggs!

243
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:46,249
There are quite a few railway stations in
this area. British Rail and Underground.

244
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,735
Yes?

245
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:54,651
One view is that areas with reasonable rail
services don't need an evening bus service too.

246
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:59,843
A very persuasive view, to my mind.
All bus services to cease after 6.30pm.

247
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,932
What about this space when the
bus station's moved to the park?

248
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:11,008
Well, the area's very short of
parking space for container lorries...

249
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,088
...especially at night.

250
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:18,285
Container lorry park on
bus station site, Bernard.

251
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:22,767
- Won't that mean widening this access road?
- Yes, indeed.

252
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,369
We'll have to take away the
western half of the swimming baths.

253
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:28,329
I'm afraid so.

254
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:32,646
Of course, these are just the local
implications of a broad national policy.

255
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,534
Exactly, Minister.

256
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,369
Even so, I ought to write a paper
to the Prime Minister personally.

257
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,570
He'd like to know the
constituency implications.

258
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:47,173
As a loyal Cabinet member, I owe that
to the PM... amongst other things!

259
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:51,651
Mind you, it would be awful
if the press got hold of this.

260
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:55,807
With so many other boroughs threatened,
there'd be a national outcry.

261
00:18:55,971 --> 00:19:02,084
- Is there a danger of them getting hold of it?
- They're very clever at getting hold of things.

262
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:05,963
- Especially if there are lots of copies.
- Oh, dear!

263
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:09,365
I shall have to make copies
for my Cabinet colleagues.

264
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:13,572
Their own constituencies will
be affected in due course.

265
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:19,331
And if it were leaked, with so many copies,
no one would ever discover who leaked it.

266
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:25,169
It so happens I'm having lunch today
with Peter Maxwell of The Times.

267
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,892
Excellent!

268
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,485
Em, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

269
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,651
You can trust me, Minister!

270
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:44,325
I'm sure you've heard rumours, Peter,
of this integrated transport policy.

271
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:48,566
- That old chestnut coming up again?
- Yes, but in an interesting form.

272
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:52,615
- The policy may have unwelcome side effects.
- Such as?

273
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,846
Job loss from integration
of bus and rail terminals,

274
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,651
job loss from joint repair shops,

275
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:01,807
job loss from streamlining
of buses and trains,

276
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,807
and reduction of
services, causing job loss.

277
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:08,325
That's just for starters.

278
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:12,405
If this is being seriously
proposed, it's quite a story.

279
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,486
- Even more interesting than you think.
- How's that?

280
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:20,883
One of the areas to suffer most is
the Prime Minister's own constituency.

281
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,204
Have you any hard facts?

282
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,721
Dear Peter, what a question!

283
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:32,892
Newspapers aren't like the government. If
we make statements, we have to prove them.

284
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:38,249
Got something in writing? There
always is in the Civil Service.

285
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:42,807
Only a confidential note from
my minister to the Prime Minister

286
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:47,730
and a similar note from my minister
to all 22 of his Cabinet colleagues.

287
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,651
Oh, that's all right, then.

288
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:55,169
Will you show it to me or shall
I get it from one of the others?

289
00:20:55,334 --> 00:21:02,044
Peter, it's a confidential document. It would
be grossly improper of me to betray it to anyone

290
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:04,570
- let alone a journalist.
- Of course.

291
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:10,968
The only way you'd get hold of a copy is if
someone were to leave it lying around by mistake.

292
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,646
I see.

293
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,727
Oh, well, back to the grindstone.

294
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,288
Well, nice to talk, Peter.
Thank you for the lunch.

295
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,445
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

296
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:30,605
Oh, Humphrey, you are SO careless!

297
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,883
Hmm?

298
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:39,048
Ah, Jim. Thanks for dropping in.

299
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:43,892
I thought I ought to tell you
that the PM isn't very pleased.

300
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,285
- Oh, not pleased?
- Not pleased.

301
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:52,923
- This story in last Tuesday's Times.
- Yes, terrible. I'm not pleased either.

302
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,566
- There's obviously been a leak.
- Obviously.

303
00:21:56,735 --> 00:22:00,570
- Can't even trust Cabinet colleagues.
- What are you suggesting?

304
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,691
Well, it might not have been one of them.

305
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:09,008
I sent a copy of my paper here to No. 10.
You don't think there's a leak here, do you?

306
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:13,771
- The PM's office does not leak!
- Of course not. Perish the thought!

307
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:19,883
It wasn't just the leak that was disturbing. It
was the misleading implications of the proposals.

308
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:25,334
- No, not misleading. Have you read my paper?
- Have you read mine?

309
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:35,169
- This is the paper from the PM's constituency.
- I believe it is.

310
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:38,963
"PM steps in to stop transport
reorganisation proposals.

311
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:45,053
"Rumours that services and jobs were threatened
in this constituency were scotched today.

312
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:50,651
"Apparently the PM has given a firm direction
to Transport Supremo designate Jim Hacker."

313
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:55,169
- I haven't heard from the Prime Minister.
- You have now!

314
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,374
I'm afraid this leak, wherever it
comes from, is a verbatim report

315
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:03,572
of a confidential minute
dictated by the PM in Ottowa.

316
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:09,450
So, the national transport
policy will need some re-thinking!

317
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,686
It will be difficult.

318
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:16,846
The PM feels it's the difficult jobs
that the ministers are there for,

319
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:21,803
- assuming they wish to remain as ministers.
- Yes, well, of course.

320
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,365
- If it needs, er...
- Rethinking.

321
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,128
...rethinking, then of
course I shall rethink.

322
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:28,695
Good.

323
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:32,450
But how did this get into
the PM's own local paper?

324
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:37,405
I don't know. But the
PM's office does not leak.

325
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:43,610
Shocking, though, isn't it?
You can't trust anyone nowadays.

326
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,570
Back to square one.
Well, that's all right.

327
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:54,044
It is NOT all right. It means I'm
still stuck with this ghastly job.

328
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:58,843
No, Minister, it is excellent news. We
now present our other kind of non-proposal.

329
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,892
- What other kind?
- The high cost, high staff kind.

330
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:05,887
We now propose a British
National Transport Authority

331
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:11,447
with a full structure, regional board, area
council, local office, liaison committee, the lot.

332
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,410
80,000 staff,
billion-a-year budget.

333
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:17,846
The Treasury will have a fit!

334
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:21,642
The whole thing will go back
to the Department of Transport.

335
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:25,602
Great. Could you do me a
paper on this, Humphrey,

336
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:30,244
with full staff and costing details
and a specimen annual budget?

337
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,008
There's a one-page summary on the front.

338
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:41,803
- Humphrey, you're marvellous.
- It's nothing, really.

339
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:45,410
I say, what if the press
should get hold of this!

340
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:52,843
- They'd have to have another leak enquiry.
- Will they really set up an enquiry?

341
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,401
- Bound to.
- Won't that be embarrassing?

342
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:58,691
No, no, no. That's what
leak enquiries are for.

343
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:02,730
Setting up. They don't
actually conduct them.

344
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:07,124
Members may be appointed, but they'll
never meet, and certainly never report.

345
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:10,811
How many leak enquiries can you
recall that named the culprit?

346
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:14,932
- In round figures.
- If you want it in round figures...

347
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,846
...none.
- They never report.

348
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:22,846
If the culprit is a civil servant, it'd be
unfair to publish. Politicians take the rap.

349
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:27,691
If it's a politician, you can't publish or
he'll disclose other leaks by his colleagues.

350
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:32,563
But chiefly they can't publish
because most leaks come from No. 10.

351
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:37,927
The ship of state, Bernard, is the
only ship that leaks from the top.

352
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:42,813
So, if the problem is a leaky PM,

353
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:47,811
as in this case, the facts are difficult to
get at and impossible to publish if you do!

354
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:52,454
May I remind you, a gentleman
from the press is waiting.

355
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:55,686
- Ah, yes.
- I'll leave you, Minister.

356
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,413
- Oh, er, Humphrey...
- Minister?

357
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:02,762
...have you got another
copy of these new proposals?

358
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,253
Of course!

359
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:08,883
- There. - Because I'm
awfully absent-minded.

360
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:12,730
I'm always leaving
documents lying around...

361
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,813
...forgetting where I've put them.

362
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:20,852
I do understand, Minister!

363
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:27,450
- Another leak. This is extremely serious.
- Yes, indeed.

364
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,293
This is almost approaching
a disciplinary level.

365
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:34,923
- I so agree, don't you, Humphrey?
- Indeed, Minister.

366
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,646
If only we could find the culprits.
It would be a most serious matter.

367
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:42,852
Perhaps I can help there.

368
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:46,288
I think that if I were
to use my influence,

369
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:52,405
I could achieve a disclosure from The Times
of how they got hold of your original plan.

370
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,721
- Oh?
- Really?

371
00:26:56,494 --> 00:27:00,169
- I might be able to help there, too.
- Indeed?

372
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:03,053
- Are you sure, Minister?
- Oh, yes.

373
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:09,846
I'm confident I can find out where the press got
the leak about the PM's opposition to our plan.

374
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:14,971
If it transpired the leak came
from the Prime Minister's own office

375
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,490
that'd be even more serious than a
leak from a Cabinet Minister's office.

376
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,534
I mean, the security implications alone...

377
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:30,695
- Perhaps we should call in the police or Ml5.
- Ml5, good idea, Minister.

378
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:34,128
A leak from the Prime Minister's
office is VERY serious.

379
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:38,971
Nevertheless, our first priority must
be to investigate the original leak.

380
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:43,526
Surely we should first investigate
a possible leak from No. 10.

381
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:48,365
In all events, the inevitable
public outcry after all these leaks

382
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:55,088
will make it awfully difficult for us to formulate
an integrated national transport policy in the DAA.

383
00:27:55,253 --> 00:28:00,852
The time is unripe, the climate is
unsuitable. The atmosphere is unfavourable.

384
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,133
Our only avenues of
approach are now blocked.

385
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:08,244
- I wonder...
- Hmm?

386
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:13,727
...if it might not be wiser to take the whole
matter back to the Department of Transport?

387
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:20,325
- That, Arnold, is a brilliant idea.
- I wish I'd thought of that.

388
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:25,490
- There remains the question of the leaks.
- Indeed.

389
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:29,535
I feel we ought to treat
this with the utmost gravity.

390
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:32,572
- I think I have a solution.
- Indeed?

391
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:38,570
Will we recommend to the Prime Minister
that we set up an immediate leak enquiry?

392
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,767
Yes, Minister!
