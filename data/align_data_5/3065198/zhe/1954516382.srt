1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,371
我和我的哥哥们是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
REBEKAH: My brothers and I
are the first vampires in history.

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:06,527
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,601
三百年前，我们把纽奥良当作家
Three hundred years ago,
we called New Orleans home.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,810
在这里，曾经有一段时间，我很快乐
I was happy here...
for a time.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,982
现在我们重回这里，发现了一个奇迹
Now, we've returned,
only to find a miracle.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,483
尼克劳斯，她怀了你的孩子
Niklaus, the girl is carrying
your child.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,553
随之，就有了新的责任
REBEKAH: And with it,
a new responsibility.

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,984
我会一直保护你
I will always protect you.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,752
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,586
但我们家族有很多敌人
REBEKAH: But our family
has many enemies.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,729
克劳斯毁了我生命中所有美好的事情
Klaus destroyed
everything good in my life.

12
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,830
所以我就要夺走他最想要的东西
So, I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

13
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,989
这些威胁本应该让我们团结起来
REBEKAH: These threats
should have united us.

14
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,668
然而，克劳斯却让我们分裂
Instead, Klaus has driven us apart.

15
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,804
你这么对以利亚，我为什么要帮你？
Why should I help you
after what you did to Elijah?

16
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,996
你是我的家人
You're my family.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,633
克劳斯永远不会停止控制你
Klaus will never stop
trying to control you.

18
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,432
你想要什么？
What do you want?

19
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,805
我哥哥以为我忠心于他
REBEKAH:
My brother expects my loyalty,

20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,844
一如既往，但现在，也许
as he has for 1,000 years,
but now, perhaps,

21
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,743
是时候做出另一种选择了
it's time to make a different choice.

22
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,487
我不该再回到这里的
REBEKAH: I should never
have come back here.

23
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,423
我在这里坠入爱河
This is the town
where I fell in love...

24
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,796
却被爱情所伤
...and where love failed us.

25
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,932
我想你知道我在说谁
I assume you know
who I'm talking about.

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,432
你应该知道，我和马赛尔
You should know, Marcel and l

27
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,005
现在关系不是很好
are not on the best of terms
right now.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,877
但你是一个神父，难道你不该
REBEKAH: But you are
an active priest, are you not?

29
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,069
准备好倾听我的忏悔吗？
Ready and able to hear
my confession?

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,575
通常“愿意”这个词
Usually, the word "willing"

31
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,013
应该会出现在这个句子中
falls somewhere in that sentence.

32
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,743
你是天主教徒吗？
Are you even Catholic?

33
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,311
我已经在这个世界活了一千年了
I've been on this earth
for 1,000 years.

34
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,855
我不敢肯定地说我相信上帝之类的
I can't say for certain that
I believe in anything like a God,

35
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,153
但我需要有人
but I need absolution...

36
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,926
来赦免我的罪
...from someone, anyone.

37
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,095
所以你愿不愿意听我的忏悔呢？
So will you hear my confession
or not?

38
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,705
神父，请宽恕我的罪
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

39
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,512
我是一个骗子，叛徒
I am a liar, a betrayer.

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,011
我密谋对付我的亲人
I have conspired
against my own blood.

41
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,182
我甚至怀疑你的上帝能不能拯救我
And I doubt even your God
could save me.

42
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,223
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：逆流之河

43
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,090
(24小时前）

44
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,503
主演：约瑟夫摩根

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,838
你今天跟我们的好朋友
马赛尔聊过了吗？
Have you spoken to our
good friend Marcel today?

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,269
没有，我该找他聊吗？
No. Should I have?

47
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,240
他最近一直悄无声息
Well, he's been
mysteriously silent,

48
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,811
神秘地躲着我
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
avoiding me, some might say.

49
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,849
我想也许他低声地对着你的耳朵
主演：克莱儿荷特
I thought, perhaps,
he may have whispered

50
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,647
把原因告诉了你
主演：克莱儿荷特
reasons into your ear...

51
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,213
在他跟你甜言蜜语时
主演：菲比托金
...along with all of those
sweet nothings.

52
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,952
如果我看到他，我一定会问问
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
If I see him,
I'll be sure to ask

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,287
他是不是还在生你的气
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
if he's still sore at you.

54
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,752
我帮你那个眼神配个音吧
Let me give a voice
to that look in your eyes.

55
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,158
我圣洁高尚的哥哥在河口
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
"My saintly, noble brother lies

56
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,894
痛苦地打滚
writhing in agony in the bayou,

57
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,535
被混蛋的哥哥咬了一口
主演：莉雅派普斯
victim of my bastard
brother's bite

58
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,532
只要一两滴他的血
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
when just one or two drops

59
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,866
就能舒缓他的疼痛
of his blood would
ease his pain."

60
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,770
恰恰相反，尼克
我只是在享用我的早餐
On the contrary, Nik.
I am simply enjoying my brekkie

61
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,468
等着以利亚恢复过来
waiting for Elijah's healthy return.

62
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,635
得了吧，蕾贝卡
Oh, come on, Rebekah.

63
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,804
整个早上你都用那种
恶狠狠的眼神瞪着我
You've been giving me
the devil's eye all morning.

64
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,006
说吧
Out with it.

65
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,014
也许我是在担心，如果我说出了
Perhaps, I'm concerned that
if I voice my opinion

66
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,882
你对以利亚干的事的看法，最终我会
about what you did to Elijah,
I will end up

67
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,148
被你的毒牙反咬一口
on the wrong side of
your toxic Hybrid teeth.

68
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,691
胡说，我绝对不会咬你
Poppycock.
I would never bite you.

69
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,496
以利亚在我对我孩子的意图这事上
Elijah made some very offensive
accusations

70
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,154
做出了非常无理的指控
about my intentions
towards my child.

71
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,960
他活该难受这么一两天
He deserves a day or two
of discomfort.

72
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,931
除此之外，你知道的
Besides,
you know my preferred method

73
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,970
处罚你们的轻率之举
of punishment
for your indiscretions

74
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,301
我更喜欢用匕首
is the dagger.

75
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,176
制片：兰斯安德森

76
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,082
你真的很有问题
There's something
fundamentally wrong with you.

77
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,852
来，把这喝了
Here. Drink this.

78
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,061
制片：朗恩麦克劳德

79
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,835
请原谅我
Forgive me, please.

80
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:02,997
没关系
It's okay.

81
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,039
记得提醒我，等你恢复了
Remind me to annihilate
your brother

82
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,510
就去灭了你弟弟
once you're healthy.

83
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,013
好，记得提醒我提醒你先排队
Yes. Remind me to remind you
to get in line.

84
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,117
我们躲在这种偏僻地方
编剧：戴克兰迪巴拉，茱莉普烈克
Doesn't help that we decided
to shack up

85
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,187
也不能去找他报仇
in the middle of a swamp, either.

86
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,819
导演：杰西瓦恩

87
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,990
- 你还好吗？
- 我没事
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,860
你继续去看书吧
Please just return to your reading.

89
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,134
我把整本都看了一遍
Well, I went through
the whole thing.

90
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,362
只是一本普通的圣经
It's just a regular Bible.

91
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,734
记录了一个家族族谱
With an entry in the family tree

92
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,170
不知道是否和我有关
that may or may not be me,

93
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,971
但你知道我一直都很担心你
but you know I've been
a little busy worrying about you.

94
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,170
海莉，拜托
Hayley, please.

95
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,780
这高烧会让我变得情绪不稳
This fever will make me unstable.

96
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,610
一旦这些幻觉出现
Now,
once these hallucinations begin,

97
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,809
我就会看到一些东西
I'll start to see things.

98
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,615
会开始胡言乱语
I will start to say things.

99
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,483
让我一个人静静吧
You must leave me here.

100
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,249
我不能就这样把你留在这里
I'm not leaving you like this.

101
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,891
好了，我来了，开始吧
All right. I'm here.
Let's do this.

102
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,862
我会说得简单点
I'll keep this simple.

103
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,197
这孩子是你们最爱的克劳斯的一个宿敌
This kid is an old enemy of
your favorite person Klaus.

104
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,836
现在，他有许多话要说
Now, he's got plenty to say

105
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,028
关于那个不忠的混蚤
about what that traitorous

106
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,435
都瞒着我干了些什么
son of a bitch has been up to
behind my back.

107
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,172
现在，胆小想离开的
Now, for those of you
faint of heart...

108
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,375
门在那边
...there's the door.

109
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,514
因为一旦留下来
Because those who stick around,

110
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,512
就代表你们要加入战争
you're signing up for battle.

111
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,186
你们都知道克劳斯并不一直都是混合种
You all know Klaus wasn't
always the Hybrid.

112
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,796
当他打破抑制他狼人一面的诅咒时
When he broke the curse that
kept his werewolf side dormant,

113
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,022
这个过程中
somewhere in all that,

114
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,667
有一部分狼人血统压制了吸血鬼的一面
certain parts were now able
to trump his vampire side,

115
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,831
比如能够传递狼人的基因
Iike the ability to pass
on the werewolf gene.

116
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,168
这就牵扯到了他一直
藏着的那个狼人女孩
That's where the werewolf girl he's
been hiding from you all comes in.

117
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,605
她来到我生活的小镇，假装是我的朋友
She rolled through my town,
pretended to be my friend,

118
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,369
最后却勾搭上了他
and ended up
hooking up with him.

119
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,076
现在她怀着他的孩子
Now she's pregnant with his kid.

120
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,273
什么乱七八糟的？
What the hell is this?

121
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,508
听完再说
Just listen.

122
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,381
当克劳斯变成混合种时
When Klaus became the Hybrid...

123
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,751
他找到了办法，让纯种的狼人
...he figured out a way
to turn full-bred werewolves

124
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,391
变成像他一样的生物
into creatures like him.

125
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,023
我就是
You're looking at one of them.

126
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,596
好处是，我们拥有作为吸血鬼的优势
On the plus side,
we had all the perks of being vampires.

127
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,857
我们更强大，速度更快
We were stronger, faster,

128
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,930
我们咬人时分泌的毒素还能杀死吸血鬼
and the toxins in our bites
could still kill a vampire,

129
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,162
但坏处就是，我们效忠于他
but on the downside,
we were loyal to him.

130
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,264
超自然地效忠
Like, supernaturally loyal.

131
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,009
是吗？但你却在这里说出了他的秘密
Right, and that's why you're
here spilling all his secrets?

132
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,169
不，这就是重点，迪亚哥
No, that's the point, Diego.

133
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,514
他找到了打破效忠的办法
He figured out a way to break
free of it.

134
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,240
我也帮助了其他人
And I helped
the rest of them, too.

135
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,076
然后克劳斯因为他们的背叛杀了他们
Then Klaus killed them
for their betrayal.

136
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,957
因为那就是克劳斯的作风
Because that is what Klaus does.

137
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,725
别介意
我只是被这故事吸引了
Don't mind me.
I'm fascinated by this story.

138
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,924
- 你好，泰勒
- 蕾贝卡
-Hello, Tyler.
-Rebekah.

139
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,729
好久不见
Long time, no see.

140
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,593
秦勒想说的是
What Tyler is about to tell you

141
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,763
我哥哥可以利用他孩子的血
is that my brother can use
his baby's blood

142
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,704
制造更多混合种
to sire more Hybrids.

143
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,735
你们会发现吸血鬼到时
就毫无立足之地了
What you will all figure out
is that vampires don't stand a chance.

144
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,918
秦勒，我猜你是想让
所有吸血鬼联合起来
So, Tyler, I assume you were
trying to rally this lot

145
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,019
确保这个孩子不会出生
into making sure
the baby isn't born.

146
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,243
是的
Yeah.

147
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,387
你不喜欢的话，尽管去帮你哥哥吧
You don't like it, go ahead
and take your brother's side,

148
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,719
但你知道我说得没错
but you know I'm right.

149
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,225
我想你误会了这位女士的意图
I believe you've mistaken
the lady's intentions.

150
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,926
好吧，到底怎么回事？
All right.
What's going on?

151
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,065
你做得很对，秦勒
You're absolutely right, Tyler.

152
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,201
我哥哥这个人简直糟糕透了
My brother is a crap enough
individual as it is.

153
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,970
绝不能再让他制造一群更优越的物种
The last thing he needs is
to sire a superior species.

154
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,335
说啊，告诉他们
Go on. You can tell them.

155
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,838
她不是来对付我们的
She's not here to fight us.

156
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,343
她是来帮我们的
She's here to help us.

157
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,308
没错，但首先…
That's right, but first...

158
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,051
呼…
Whew...

159
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,661
伤害那孩子的话题就说到这吧
That is enough talk
about harming that baby.

160
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,825
克劳斯才是我们要阻止的人
Klaus is the one
we're putting a stop to.

161
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,529
他们都抛弃了我
KLAUS:
They have all forsaken me.

162
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,999
我的兄弟姊妹和我父母一样
My siblings are as deceitful
and diseased

163
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,201
虚伪，病态
as my parents ever were.

164
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,841
指责我为了一己之私利用自己的孩子
Accusing me of using
my baby for my own gain.

165
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,148
比起自己的家人更信任外人
Trusting others
before their own blood.

166
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,016
给我台笔电不行吗？
Would a laptop kill you?

167
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,158
海明威很喜欢那台打字机
That typewriter was good
enough for Hemingway.

168
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,451
你们的确有相似之处
I can see the resemblance.

169
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,390
酗酒和胡乱施暴
Booze and random acts of violence.

170
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,053
以利亚和蕾贝卡用他们恶毒的谎言
Elijah and Rebekah
have cut to the quick

171
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,199
深深伤害了我
with their vicious lies about me

172
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,028
我所做的一切都是为了赢得
when all I've done is tried to win

173
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,261
这场战争，从马赛尔的手中夺回
this battle of wills over
Marcel's control

174
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,770
法语区的控制权，拿回我们的家
of the Quarter
in order to reclaim our home.

175
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,169
继续打啊
Type, please.

176
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,366
有什么意义呢？
What's the point?

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,274
你只不过是一遍遍重复说着同样的事
You just repeat the same thing
over and over again.

178
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,313
蕾贝卡要弄垮你，以利亚要弄垮你
Rebekah is out to get you.
Elijah is out to get you.

179
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,644
有没有人不想把你弄垮呢？
Is there anyone
who isn't plotting your downfall?

180
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,615
我怀疑你连自己的影子都不相信
I doubt you trust
your own reflection.

181
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,254
如果匕首没有失踪
You know,
if the daggers weren't missing,

182
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,549
我一定会在他们的胸口各插一把
I would put one
in each of their hearts.

183
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,757
让他们停歇几个世纪，我也好耳根清净
Rid myself of the burden of my
siblings for a couple of centuries.

184
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,396
瞧瞧你
Look at you,

185
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,657
一次又一次重复着同样消极的循环
repeating the same destructive cycles
over and over again.

186
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,497
是你自己造就了你的不幸
You are the architect
of your own unhappiness.

187
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,300
我不记得我征询过你的建议
I don't remember asking
for your advice.

188
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,630
是吗？
Oh, really?

189
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,140
纽奥良那么多人
So, of all the people
in New Orleans,

190
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,176
你却选了一个有心理学硕士学位的人
you choose someone
with a master's in psychology

191
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,179
记录你的传记
你都一千多岁了
to record your life story.
You're over a thousand years old.

192
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,249
绝对知道怎么打字
Pretty damn sure
you know how to type.

193
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,648
真相就是，你魅惑我来这里
The truth is,
you compel me to come here

194
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,481
因为你没有其他人可倾诉
because you have no one else
to talk to,

195
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,418
而你想要被理解
and you want to be understood.

196
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,819
然后你魅惑我，一离开这里
Then you compel me
to forget everything

197
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,483
就忘记一切
因为你太害怕，不敢信任任何人
as soon as I leave your presence
because you're too scared to trust.

198
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,652
我什么都不怕
I am scared of nothing.

199
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,462
这是什么？
What is this?

200
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,166
这是个古老的神秘图案
我要用它摧毁你
It's an ancient, mystical plot
I'm using to destroy you.

201
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,840
别紧张，这只是个纹身设计图
Relax. It's a tattoo design.

202
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,477
空闲时间再画这些
Draw on your own time.

203
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,410
这就是我的空闲时间
你强占了我的时间
This is my time.
You steal it from me.

204
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,349
你想把他放在哪？
Where do you want him?

205
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,017
随便放在什么方便的地方
Well, just put him anywhere handy

206
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,130
直到处理完克劳斯
until Klaus is taken care of.

207
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,797
我们要把克劳斯放在哪？
Where are we gonna put Klaus?

208
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,668
他得和其他人离得远远的
He needs to be away
from all the others.

209
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,835
我们可不希望他挑起战争
We don't want him
fomenting dissent.

210
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,540
你知道他很善于运用言语
他能用嘴皮解决一切
You know he has a knack with words.
He could talk his way out of hell.

211
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,144
没错，我在后面为他挑了一块地方
Yeah. I got a spot picked
out for him in the back.

212
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,840
接下来的52年里
他只能和他自己说话了
Only person he's gonna be talking to
for the next 52 years is himself.

213
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,072
52年？
Fifty-two?

214
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,345
他在19世纪时用匕首封了你52年
One for each year that he kept
you daggered in the 1800s.

215
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,746
当时你默许他用匕首封住我
You mean,
you let him keep me daggered.

216
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,652
克劳斯关在这里的每一年
我都会向你道歉
And I'll spend every year Klaus is
in here apologizing to you for it.

217
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,353
随便几年就够了
Well, I'll settle for long enough

218
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,694
只要我能享受到一点真正的快乐
to experience just
a little bit of happiness...

219
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,432
并确保我的侄女不会变成
混合种繁殖机器
...and ensure that my niece isn't turned
into a Hybrid breeding machine.

220
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,604
要把他关在这里很困难
It's gonna be tough to keep him
in here.

221
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,471
你的那个小女巫
能够增加我们的胜算
That little witch of yours
would put the odds in our favor.

222
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,700
我不能冒险
I can't risk it.

223
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,677
她最近越来越不能控制她的魔法了
She's got less and less control
over her magic lately.

224
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,440
我根本没法让她离开教堂阁楼
I can't even get her out
of the church attic,

225
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,279
更不可能指望她去对付克劳斯
much less rely on her to go
to battle against Klaus.

226
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,114
那我们就需要你派出最好的战士
Then we'll need
your very best warriors.

227
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,017
克劳斯很强大，也很狡猾
Klaus is strong and crafty,

228
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,648
背叛会让他特别生气
and betrayal makes him
particularly nasty.

229
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,654
我们所做的事，每一件
What we're doing is nothing Klaus

230
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,163
克劳斯都对你和你哥哥
hasn't done to both
you and your brother

231
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,732
做过很多次
a dozen times over.

232
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,766
你不是在动摇吧？
You're not getting second
thoughts now, are you?

233
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,203
没有，没有动摇
No.
These aren't second thoughts.

234
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,469
只是很后悔
They're feelings of regret.

235
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,404
一百年前我就应该埋了他
I should've buried him
a hundred years ago.

236
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,841
这样我们就可以多在一起一百年
It's a hundred years
we could've been together.

237
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,331
没事的，没事
It's okay. It's okay.

238
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,776
莎莉丝特
ELlJAH: Celeste.

239
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,282
哦，莎莉丝特
Oh, Celeste.

240
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,664
海莉，对不起
Hayley, I'm sorry.

241
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,163
我把你当成别人了
I thought you were someone else.

242
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,097
- 莎莉丝特？
- 对
-Celeste?
-Yes.

243
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,466
不管她是谁，她确实非常性感
Whoever she was,
she was smoking hot.

244
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,330
你怎么…
How....

245
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,309
我让你进入我的脑袋了吗？
Did I let you enter my thoughts?

246
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,237
我感觉不太好，我该走了
I'm not well.
I should go.

247
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,914
- 这…
- 没事的
-This is....
-This is fine.

248
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,415
以利亚，你病了，我在照顾你
Elijah, you're sick.
I'm taking care of you.

249
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,326
我们被监视了
We're being watched.

250
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,961
嘿！
Hey!

251
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,604
嘿！
Hey!

252
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,822
老天，我永远也习惯不了你这样出现
Oh, man,
I'll never get used to that.

253
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,899
我怎么感觉你学过戏剧呢？
Why do I get the feeling
you studied theater?

254
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,559
整个世界就是一个舞台，约书亚
All the world's a stage,
young Joshua,

255
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,968
而我恰巧是你终生难忘的角色
and it just so happens I have
the role of a lifetime for you.

256
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,905
你有什么消息，小约？
What do you got, Josh?

257
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,642
我有什么消息？
What do I got?

258
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,613
克劳斯要我从你这偷一把什么匕首
Klaus wants me to steal
some dagger from you.

259
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,779
这是试探
It's a test, okay?

260
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,516
他一定知道我为你效力，我确定
He knows I'm working for you.
I'm sure of it.

261
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,388
那个混蛋又想用匕首封住我们了
That bastard
wants to dagger us again.

262
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,552
他的下场都是他自找的
He deserves everything
he's gonna get.

263
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,888
别紧张
Relax.

264
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,795
如果他知道了
你现在早就被撕成两半了
If he knew, he would've ripped your
spine out through your nose by now.

265
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,435
好极了
Oh, great.

266
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,935
我现在真是超轻松的
我该怎么做？
Now I feel totally at ease.
What am I supposed to do?

267
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,834
你告诉他，你到处都找过了
You tell him
you searched high and low

268
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,269
就是找不到匕首
but you couldn't find the dagger.

269
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,636
天啊，我死定了
Oh, God, I'm so dead.

270
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,370
然后你告诉他，你看到我拿着
Then you tell him you saw
I had it on me,

271
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,343
如果他想要，他就得自己来拿
that if he wants it,
he'll have to come and get it,

272
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,539
这可不容易，因为我很多疑
which won't be easy
because I'm paranoid

273
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,446
还加强了防卫
and I beefed up my posse.

274
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,781
是这样，我不是在怀疑
All right.
So, not doubting

275
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,388
你身为吸血鬼的毁灭能力
your mad vampire skills of
destruction or anything,

276
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,184
但马赛尔现在高度戒备
but Marcel is on red alert,

277
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,657
派了很多人保护他
surrounded by, like, an army.

278
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,524
你会被粉身碎骨的，除非…
You're totally boned unless....

279
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,789
除非什么？
Unless what?

280
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,394
我听到他和迪亚哥争吵
I overheard him arguing
with Diego.

281
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,502
显然他今晚会清理场地
Apparently, he's clearing out
the compound tonight

282
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,102
为了一个约会什么的
for a date or something.

283
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,537
总之他会在那里
That's where Marcel will be.

284
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,234
待我统治纽奥良时
When I run New Orleans,

285
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,742
我会为你率备一枚永恒的日光戒指
约书亚
there will be a permanent
daylight ring in it for you, Joshua,

286
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,881
作为你效忠真正国王的赏赐
for services rendered
unto your true king.

287
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,942
好极了
Cool.

288
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,979
但你若胆敢背叛我
But if you ever betray me...

289
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,560
我会确保你无尽的余生
I will make sure you spend
the rest of your eternal life

290
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,097
将在极端的苦痛中度过
乞求以死解脱
in exquisite agony
wishing for a merciful death.

291
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,675
永别了，克劳斯
Adios, Klaus.

292
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,124
你想怎么样？
What do you want?

293
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,826
这是爱尔兰蒸馏酒
It's Poitin.

294
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,220
传说此酒能让死者复活
It'd raise the dead,

295
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,367
杀了他们，再把他们复活
kill them, and raise them again.

296
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,402
我想跟你谈谈你侄女卡蜜儿的事
I'd like to talk to you
about your niece, Camille.

297
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,374
相信你也早有怀疑
I'm sure you suspect this already

298
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,343
根据她记忆里的空隙不难推断
by the gaps in her memory.

299
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,475
我魅惑了她
I compel her.

300
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,212
起初是因为她是个有用的间谋
At first, it was because
she was a useful spy

301
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,855
但如今是为了保护她
but now for her own protection.

302
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,787
我猜一定是有吸血鬼在扰乱她的心智
I assumed a vampire
was messing with her mind,

303
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,018
但我从没想过你会供认不讳
though I never anticipated
a confession.

304
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,856
她始终不肯放下往事
She won't leave things be.

305
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,091
这教堂内发生的惨剧
Her mind churns
with the permutations

306
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,323
她的双胞胎哥哥大开杀戒的画面
of what happened in this church

307
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,229
在她脑海中翻腾交织
when her twin went on
his slaughter spree.

308
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,996
眼下，如果她知道了事情的真相
Now, if she finds out
what really happened...

309
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,836
知道事关吸血鬼及女巫的诅咒
That the vampires and witch
hexes were involved...

310
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,341
她一定会不断追查下去
直到涉入过深
She will dig and dig and dig
until she digs too deep

311
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,240
最终因此丧命
and gets herself killed.

312
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,540
纽奥良将会成为她的葬身之地
New Orleans
will be the death of her.

313
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,481
她必须离开
She needs to leave...

314
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,879
而且虽说来讽刺
...and, as ironic as it may seem,

315
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,024
但我希望由她自己做出这个选择
I believe it should be her choice.

316
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,091
没错
Yes.

317
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,660
与控制人心智的吸血鬼
谈论自由意志的确很讽刺
It is ironic discussing free will
with a mind-controlling vampire.

318
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,663
她是个聪明的女孩
She's a clever girl.

319
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,467
她今早才教训了我一顿
She gave me a piece of
her mind earlier today.

320
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,073
换作其他人我早杀了
I would've killed others for less.

321
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,668
我在乎她的生死
I care about her survival.

322
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,379
我嗅到了战争的气息
I smell war in the air,

323
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,845
而每一场战争
and with every war,

324
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,984
都有无辜的受害者可避免战火的牵连
there is the innocent victim
who could have been spared

325
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,450
如果他们能及早逃开
if they had just walked away.

326
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,580
请说服她离开纽奥良
Please convince her to walk away
from New Orleans...

327
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,288
否则我不得不以魅惑逼她离开
...or I'll be forced
to compel her to go.

328
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,621
这位绅士，能帮我擦身吗？
Assistance, please, good sir.

329
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,250
不，我更乐意欣赏眼前的美景
No. I'm much happier taking
in such a wondrous view.

330
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,828
如此醉人的美景
It's perfection.

331
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,165
你那弟弟又不安分了
Your brother is again
up to no good.

332
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,068
他向贵族们发起决斗的挑战
He's challenging the gentry
to duels

333
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,729
好像他们能有公平竞争的机会似的
as though they have any
chance of a fair fight.

334
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,673
我已厌倦了牺牲我自身的愉悦
I do grow weary
of sacrificing my joy

335
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,904
去替我弟弟收拾残局
to temper my brother's mischief.

336
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,376
你一定能施个咒吧
Surely, you can cast a spell.

337
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,045
让他不能胡作非为
Put him in his place.

338
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,721
那得上百个女巫才能办到了
It will take 100 witches
to put him in his place.

339
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,790
再说，他向来只听你的话
Besides,
he only ever listens to you.

340
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,983
这倒是
Yes.

341
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,796
他真的要学会点规矩了
He certainly needs
a little discipline.

342
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,200
也许打屁股是个好办法
Perhaps a spanking of
some kind is in order.

343
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,062
我想我需要先练习一下，来
I think I shall need some rehearsal.
Come.

344
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,309
海莉，拜托，这场高烧
Hayley, please.
This fever.

345
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,286
让我的脑海中充斥着痛苦的回忆
My mind is flooded with
these tortuous memories.

346
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,685
你必须离开
You have to leave.

347
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,086
你这人怎么回事？
What is your deal?

348
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,192
你不喜欢被人照顾吗？
You don't like people taking
care of you?

349
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,489
关心我的人都没好下场
There are consequences for those
that care.

350
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,332
我不会让你承受这些的
I will not have you pay that price.

351
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,163
你不就做了些奇怪的复古春梦吗？
So you're having weird
retro sex dreams.

352
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,328
别多想了，我是留定了
Get over it. I'm staying.

353
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,275
之前的那个访客呢？
So, what about our visitor?

354
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,203
她想干什么？
What does she want?

355
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,304
我猜昨晚在门口留下这本
I'm guessing she's the one that

356
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,746
神秘圣经的人就是她
Ieft the mystery Bible on
the doorstep last night.

357
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,010
要是她愿意多留一会
Would be nice
if she'd stick around

358
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,915
告诉我个中缘由就好了
Iong enough to tell me why.

359
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,056
海莉，你是来寻找你家人的线索的
Hayley, you came here to gather
information about your family,

360
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,091
不是来照顾一个发高烧的吸血鬼
not to play nursemaid to
a vampire with a temperature.

361
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,196
拜托，去找她
问出你想知道的一切
Please... find her.
Learn what you can.

362
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,133
不，我要留下来
No. I'm staying.

363
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,857
克劳斯
Klaus.

364
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,056
你一直没接我的电话
You've been avoiding my calls.

365
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,893
我最近有点生气
A little pissed off lately.

366
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,592
我稍后再为我的所作所为道歉
Apologies for my behavior
can come later.

367
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,536
你手上有我的东西，还给我
You have something of mine.
I want it back.

368
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,840
抱歉，我不能还你
Sorry, but I can't do that.

369
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,849
这是什么意思？
What is this?

370
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,883
为你的所作所为道歉？
Apologies for your behavior?

371
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,621
你不会道歉的，尼克，你只会装一下
You don't apologize, Nik.
You just act.

372
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,952
我受够了，我们都受够了
I've had enough.
We have had enough.

373
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,195
瞧瞧，你终于将唯一能
Well, look at you,
finally in possession

374
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,265
让你陷入沉睡的武器拿到手了
of the one thing
that can take you down.

375
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,133
- 感觉如何？
- 好极了
-How does it feel?
-Great.

376
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,141
就这样吗？
So this is it.

377
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:30,152
禽兽克劳斯的行为已经人神共愤
The evil bastard Klaus
has gone too far,

378
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,914
必须受到惩罚
must be punished.

379
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,684
而且还是由他的妹妹来执行
And by his own sibling,
nonetheless.

380
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,919
跟圣经真有异曲同工之妙
How positively biblical.

381
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,992
至于你，马赛尔
And you, Marcel,

382
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,929
这就是你所谓的致命一击吗？
is this your idea of a hit?

383
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,867
我教你的围剿可不止
靠这样一群乌合之众
I taught you better than this
paltry excuse for a takedown.

384
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,739
你以为这样就能制服我吗？
You think you can subdue me
with this?

385
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,442
是不能，但或许这样就足够了
No, but I think I can with this.

386
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,027
嗯
Well....

387
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,912
莎莉丝特
Celeste....

388
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,583
原谅我
Forgive me.

389
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,551
对不起
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,671
就这样吗？
Is that it?

391
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,873
这就是纽奥良最强的枪手？
Is this the best New Orleans
has to offer?

392
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,545
弟弟，住手吧，这太荒唐了
Brother, please.
This is high folly.

393
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,247
难道你这几周来
Is it not enough
that you have slaughtered

394
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,017
杀戮得还不够吗？
dozens in just these past
several weeks?

395
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,217
这个嘛…
Well....

396
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,556
城里横尸遍地的消息
很快就会传到大洋彼岸
Word of a city littered with bodies
will surely travel the oceans.

397
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,527
你想把父亲引来吗？
Do you want to bring our father
upon us?

398
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,189
别担心，哥哥
Relax, brother.

399
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,096
我已经放出风声说这些尸体
I've sent rumor that
the bodies are a result

400
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,761
是女巫为了寻找血祭的祭品而造成的
of the witches seeking blood
sacrifice for their rituals.

401
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,904
你做了什么？
You did what?

402
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,072
难道你忘了莎莉丝特正是
Have you forgotten
Celeste is one of those

403
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,270
你嫁祸对象的其中一人吗？
that you so recklessly
pointed your finger at?

404
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,641
谁是莎莉丝特？
Who's Celeste?

405
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,147
对了，就是最近跟你鬼混的女巫是吧？
Oh, yes, the witch
you've been knocking around with.

406
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,444
别担心
妓女在法语区就如老鼠一样
Well, fear not.
Harlots are like rats in the Quarter.

407
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,850
每走一步都能踩到一只
You trip over one
every step you take.

408
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,061
你在乎她，那真是不幸
You care about her.
Well, that is unfortunate.

409
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,565
我听说他们现在正在抓捕全城的女巫
I hear they're rounding up
the town's witches as we speak.

410
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,437
以利亚？
Elijah?

411
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,671
尼克劳斯，我要杀了你这个混蛋
Niklaus, I'll kill you,
you bastard.

412
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,912
以利亚？
Elijah?

413
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,424
我也很高兴认识你
Hello to you, too.

414
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,270
我们结束这幼稚的游戏吧
Let's end this charade, shall we?

415
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,678
纽奥良的吸血鬼们
Vampires of New Orleans...

416
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:46,245
要记住我是真祖之一我是混合种
...do recall that I am an Original,
a Hybrid.

417
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,477
我有不死之身
I cannot be killed.

418
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,279
永恒是一段很长的时间
Eternity is an awfully long time.

419
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:57,424
你们觉得马赛尔还能掌权多久？
How long to you think
Marcel will stay in power?

420
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:04,536
如果你们其中一人愿意放了我
What if one of you lot
were to release me,

421
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:09,402
将会得到我永恒的感恩
knowing I would be eternally
in your debt?

422
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:15,377
我会可怜那些敢与我对抗的人
I would pity those of you
who dared to cross me.

423
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,912
我向你们保证
I can assure you...

424
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:22,315
你们一定会死得轰轰烈烈
...your ends would be spectacular.

425
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,880
这是我从一个老朋友那
To borrow a trick...

426
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,792
学来的把戏
...from an old friend....

427
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:35,959
谁捡起这枚硬币
Whoever picks up this coin...

428
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,327
就能活下去
...gets to live.

429
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,899
现在，你们这群混蛋
有人要加入我吗？
Now, which of you magnificent
bastards wants to join me?

430
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,907
想要那枚硬币的人
Anyone wants that coin,

431
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,046
向克劳斯宣誓效忠吧
pledge allegiance to Klaus.

432
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,110
就是现在
Take it now.

433
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,944
去吧，选择权在你们手上
Go ahead.
The choice is yours.

434
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,758
拿下他
Take him.

435
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,638
马赛尔，过来我们决一死战！
Marcel! Come and finish this!

436
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,214
不要去
No.

437
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,649
- 捡起硬币
- 你说什么？
-Take the coin.
-What?

438
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,214
不杀光所有人他是不会罢休的
他也会杀了你
He won't stop until everyone is dead,
and he will kill you, too.

439
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,520
结束这一切吧，捡起硬币
End this. Pick up the coin.

440
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,731
够了
Enough!

441
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,925
瞧瞧啊
Well, well, well.

442
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,458
伟大的马赛尔
The great Marcel,

443
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,568
自称纽奥良国王的人
self-proclaimed king
of New Orleans,

444
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,761
正跪在我的面前
bowing before me.

445
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,700
拿去
There.

446
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,335
我在此宣誓效忠于你
I hereby pledge my allegiance
to you.

447
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,446
你现在拥有我的王国
You have the keys to my kingdom.

448
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,579
它是你的了
It's yours.

449
00:28:56,964 --> 00:28:58,898
我正准备回家
I was on my way home,

450
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,895
看你偷偷溜了进来
saw you duck in here...

451
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:03,661
我就知道你一定会在这里
...knew exactly where you'd be.

452
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,202
这些恶作剧又来了
This is getting old.

453
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,862
这周第二次了
It's the second time this week.

454
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,268
是第三次
Third.

455
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,843
我前天才清理过
I cleaned it off
the day before yesterday.

456
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:13,377
一点用都没有，他们还会这么做的
It's pointless.
They'll just do it again.

457
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:15,677
大家只是需要时间来淡忘
Folks need time to heal.

458
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,641
西恩杀了许多无辜的人
Sean killed innocent people.

459
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:21,384
没人能这么快摆脱阴影
No one is getting over that
any time soon.

460
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,723
我觉得…
I think...

461
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,885
我觉得我要跟他一样发疯了
I think I'm losing it like he did.

462
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,729
我在口袋里发现了这个
I found this in my pocket.

463
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,701
这图案
The lines,

464
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:39,367
是我跟西恩小时候
经常用的暗号
it's a secret code Sean and l
used to use when we were kids.

465
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,641
但我不记得自己画过
I have no memory of drawing it.

466
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:46,642
有点不对劲，我也搞不清楚
Something is not right.
I just can't figure it out.

467
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:48,075
过来
Come here.

468
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:58,414
不如你离开这里一段时间吧
Maybe you should leave town
for a while.

469
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:03,053
出去散散心，放松一下
Give your head some space.

470
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:05,197
我认识你的系主任
I know your dean.

471
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,594
你可以先不急着写论文
You could put your thesis on hold.

472
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:09,030
不行
I can't.

473
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,133
这一定意味着什么
This means something.

474
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:13,704
我只是不知道
I just don't know what.

475
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,899
并不是每件事都要有意义
Not everything has meaning.

476
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,042
有时你要学会放下
Sometimes you just have to let go.

477
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:21,237
你应该离开纽奥良
You should leave New Orleans.

478
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,679
不是所有人都适合这里
This town isn't for everybody.

479
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:25,345
拜托
Please.

480
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,720
你一定有很多疑问
I'm sure you got questions.

481
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:35,657
大概有一箩筐吧
比如你是谁？
Only a thousand of them.
Like who are you?

482
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,694
你跟踪我干什么？
Why are you following me?

483
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:38,953
其他人都去哪里了？
Where the hell is everyone?

484
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:40,827
如果这本书里的人
And if the people in this book

485
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,094
真的是我的家人，他们出了什么事？
really are my family,
what happened to them?

486
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,737
我叫伊芙
I'm Eve.

487
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:46,395
我跟踪你是因为你让一个真祖吸血鬼
I'm following you
because you brought an Original

488
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,172
来到狼人的地盘
to werewolf country,

489
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:49,975
所以大多数狼人
which is pretty much
the same reason

490
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,735
都逃走了
why everybody else skedaddled.

491
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,539
如果你想知道
And if you want to know
what happened

492
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,240
族谱上的人出了什么事
to the people in that family tree,

493
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:57,849
简而言之
summing it up nice and quick,

494
00:30:58,118 --> 00:30:59,642
是因为马赛尔
Marcel happened.

495
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,048
他做了什么？
What did he do?

496
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:02,882
大部分狼人都被他杀了
He killed most of them.

497
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,223
后来那些幸存下来的后代
Later, the descendents of the ones
who dodged death,

498
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:11,664
他迫使一个女巫对他们下了诅咒
he strong-armed a witch
into putting a curse on them.

499
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,299
什么样的诅咒？
What kind of curse?

500
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,892
那个诅咒颠覆了自然规律
Swap nature around, inside out,

501
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:20,004
使狼形成为他们的自然状态
made it so their natural state
was wolves.

502
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:22,869
只有在满月时才能变回人形
They only turn back human
on the full moon.

503
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:28,170
我们因为身上的印记而遭到追捕
就是那个新月胎记
We get hunted by the marks we carry,
that crescent moon birthmark.

504
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:30,744
所以我毁掉了自己的
That's why I got rid of mine.

505
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,951
我不想被人发现
I didn't want to get found out.

506
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:34,843
晚安
ELlJAH: Good evening.

507
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:41,087
我似乎…
Think I might have

508
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,161
不小心拿了你的东西
something which belongs to you.

509
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,733
以利亚，我来处理
你还好吗？
Elijah, I've got this.
Are you okay?

510
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,266
伤口愈合了，烧也退了
The wound had healed,
the fever has broken,

511
00:31:49,436 --> 00:31:52,303
但奇怪的是
but for some strange reason...

512
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:56,973
我背上一直有股刺痛感
...I have this sharp and lingering
sensation in my back.

513
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:02,537
我得送他回家
但我会回来的，好吗？
I have to get him home,
but I'll be back, okay?

514
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,276
我想知道更多事
I need to know more.

515
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:06,442
遮好你的印记
Keep that mark covered up.

516
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,925
发生什么事了？
What happened?

517
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:20,931
我刚见到了我的家人
I just met part of my family.

518
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,865
看看你干的好事
Looking at what you've wrought?

519
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:05,677
听着，你要是想杀我
Look. If you're gonna kill me,

520
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:07,074
就速战速决吧
Iet's get this over with.

521
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:08,839
我为什么要杀你？
Why would I kill you?

522
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,976
你捡起了硬币
You picked up the coin.

523
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,481
战争也是有规则的，马赛尔
There are rules of engagement
in battle, Marcel.

524
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:15,314
没有规则，将是一片混乱
Without them,
you'd have anarchy.

525
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,055
而我倒想聊聊
I would, however, like to talk

526
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,489
所有权的问题
about accommodations.

527
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,424
比如你现在生活的区域
Your living quarters,
for example.

528
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:26,258
曾经是属于我的
I believe they used to be mine.

529
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:28,961
你想要这一切吗？可以，给你了
You want all this? Fine.
It's yours.

530
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:31,865
你可以把我赶回街上，无所谓
You can put me back
on the street for all I care.

531
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:34,902
不过有件事最好说清楚
But let's make one thing clear.

532
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:36,770
你永远无法拥有…
You'll never have this...

533
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:40,207
忠诚
Loyalty.

534
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:43,008
买不到，也无法拥有
You can't buy it.
You can't own it.

535
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:44,172
这是强求不来的
You can't force it.

536
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:49,084
忠诚只来自于对那些信任你的人
的爱和尊重
It comes only out of love
and respect
for the people who believe in you.

537
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:54,552
你教过我很多东西，尼克劳斯米卡森
You taught me many things,
Niklaus Mikaelson,

538
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,719
不过这个是我自己学到的
but this I learned myself...

539
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:00,399
而你永远无法领悟到这一点
...and it is something that
you will never know.

540
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:07,135
祝你统治愉快
Enjoy your kingdom.

541
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:41,365
谢谢你送我
So, thanks for the ride.

542
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,076
这一切有点尴尬，也有点惊险，是吧？
Quite the awkward, little adventure,
wouldn't you say?

543
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,405
抱歉我试图伤害你
我绝对不是故意的
I'm sorry I tried to hurt you.
I would never want that.

544
00:34:50,984 --> 00:34:52,281
以利
Elij--

545
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,080
告诉我莎莉丝特怎么了
Tell me what happened
to Celeste.

546
00:34:54,254 --> 00:34:56,017
- 这不重要
- 这很重要
-That's not important.
-lt is important.

547
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,155
你有一千年的记忆
A thousand years of memories,

548
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,316
你发烧出现幻觉时却只想到她？
and that's what breaks
through your fever brain?

549
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,787
我想知道，告诉我吧
I want to know.
Show me.

550
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:57,374
对女巫来说，那是个残忍而血腥的时代
It was a cruel and bloody time
to be a witch.

551
00:35:58,218 --> 00:35:59,947
拜我那好弟弟所赐
Courtesy of my wonderful brother.

552
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:02,783
克劳斯杀了她吗？
She died because of Klaus?

553
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,048
是我害了她
She died because of me.

554
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,921
因为我太在乎她了
Because I cared too deeply for her.

555
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:12,260
我任由自己放松对克劳斯的管控
I had allowed my brother
to slip through my grasp.

556
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:15,526
而我自己却和莎莉丝特共享每一刻欢喻
I'd loosened the reins while
Celeste consumed my every moment.

557
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:18,364
我只顾自己享乐，放纵了他
I'd abandoned him in the
name of my own happiness.

558
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:22,335
莎莉丝特付出了生命的代价
Celeste paid the price.

559
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,033
我不懂
I don't get it.

560
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,306
我们为什么还回来？
Why are we here?

561
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:30,241
为什么你还要修补你们家族的关系？
Why are you trying to put
together your family

562
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:33,079
非常明显，它已经破裂了
when it's so clear that
one part of it is broken?

563
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,412
对我来说“破裂”
To me, the very definition
of the word "broken"

564
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:37,852
就表示那是可以修补的
suggests that
something can be fixed.

565
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:41,153
我有无尽的时间来完成这一个任务
I have all eternity
to accomplish one single task:

566
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:42,658
拯救我弟弟
my brother's salvation.

567
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,194
如果我放弃了，那么你告诉我
If I surrender this,
then, tell me,

568
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:48,232
我对我的家族，对我自己
对你腹中的孩子
what value would I be
to my family, to myself, to...

569
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:52,499
还有什么意义？
To your child?

570
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:01,070
不要这样，海莉
Please, no, Hayley.

571
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:03,277
你已经看到发生什么事了
You've seen what happens.

572
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:40,783
以利亚回来了，现在只有一把匕首
Elijah is home.
There's only one dagger.

573
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:43,553
今天你想惩罚我们中的哪个？
Which one of us will you
be punishing today?

574
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:45,791
我想到一个游戏
I contemplated a game

575
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:50,053
点兵点将，点到哪个就哪个
of eeny meeny minie moe.

576
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:54,292
你背叛了我，我的亲妹妹
You betrayed me, my own sister.

577
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,864
尼克劳斯，你敢
Niklaus, don't you dare.

578
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:58,595
那也许我该拿你开刀，哥哥
Well, perhaps it should be you,
brother,

579
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,069
对海莉温柔献媚，甜言蜜语
stealing my child away
with every fawning moment

580
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:02,902
然后就可以偷走我的孩子
of tenderness you show to Hayley.

581
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,407
这事跟海莉无关
This has nothing to do
with Hayley.

582
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:06,568
全都跟她有关！
It has everything to do with her!

583
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,344
她从刚来时就倾心于你
She's adored you
since she arrived.

584
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,686
现在我的孩子，我的亲生骨肉
And now my child, my blood,

585
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:17,755
长大后要叫你爸爸了
will grow up to call you father.

586
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:20,816
你是这么想的吗？
Is that what this is?

587
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:24,359
你又担心自己要被抛弃了吗？
You are once again worried
that you will be left behind?

588
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:28,429
这么多年你怎么还没明白？
不是我们抛弃你，尼克
Has history taught you nothing?
We don't abandon you, Nik.

589
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,932
是你一直弃我们不顾
You drive us away.

590
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:33,928
是这样吗？
Is that so?

591
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:40,203
我最近不是一直在配合你们吗？
What have I done lately
other than cooperate?

592
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:43,077
我向你低头，哥哥
I bowed down to you, brother...

593
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,215
为了弥补我桶了你
...to make up for daggering you,

594
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:48,149
为了我们要夺回家园的伟大计划
for the greater good of our plan
to reclaim our home.

595
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,088
相反地，妹妹
Look the other way, sister.

596
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:52,953
你又开始了和马赛尔的纠缠
While you repeat
the same cycle with Marcel,

597
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,822
又陷入这个你不该爱的男人的陷阱
falling again for a man
you shouldn't be with,

598
00:38:56,062 --> 00:38:58,758
而他却统治着这个由我们建立起的帝国
while he controls the empire
that we built,

599
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:01,025
他占为己有
that he took!

600
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,031
对于我过去的罪恶，我无法否认
Now,
I make no excuses for past sins,

601
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:10,809
但那一刻，你们两个本可以
but in the one moment
when you two could have

602
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:14,970
选择支持我，相信我
chosen to stand by me.
To believe in me...

603
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,144
相信我对自己的亲骨肉没有别的意图
...and believe my intentions
for my own child were pure.

604
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:23,956
你们却选择背叛我
You chose to stand against me...

605
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,750
去和我的敌人站在一边
To side with my enemies.

606
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,423
我想夺回我们的家
I wanted our home back.

607
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:37,364
现在我成功了
Now I have it.

608
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:39,933
所以我要去那里生活
So, I'm going to live there.

609
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:41,773
你们两个
And the two of you...

610
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:46,111
就一起待在这里
You can stay here together...

611
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,246
慢慢腐烂吧
...and rot.

612
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,039
你跟我走，小狼
You're coming with me,
little wolf.

613
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,072
我干嘛要跟你走？
Why would I go anywhere with you?

614
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:21,003
海莉，因为你肚子里的孩子
Because, Hayley,
that child you carry

615
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,307
是这个世界上我唯一在乎的东西
is the only thing on this earth
that matters to me.

616
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,384
你可以反抗我，但你赢不了我
Now, you can fight me on this,
but you will lose.

617
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:33,117
任何想阻止你上车的人也赢不了我
As will anyone else who tries
to stop you getting in this car.

618
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:58,243
我弄明白了，我做的笔记
I figured it out, the note.

619
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,044
我一直在想，我的时间去哪了？
I was thinking about it--
my lost time,

620
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,710
为什么大脑一直昏昏沉沉的？
my foggy brain.

621
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:04,857
我以为我跟西恩一样疯了
I thought I must be going crazy
like Sean...

622
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:08,851
但后来我想，是不是我的潜意识里
...but then I thought,
"What if somewhere
in my subconscious,

623
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:11,661
想要给我自己暗示呢？
I was trying
to send myself a message?"

624
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:16,126
的确如此
I was.

625
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,364

626
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:25,872
我在1919年的皮卡尤恩日报里
发现了这个
I found this in the Picayune
newspaper archives from 1919.

627

628
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,142
看这张照片
Look at this photo.

629
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,822
这些人，我认识他们
Those men, I know them.

630
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:43,287
他们两个我都认识
I know both of them.
