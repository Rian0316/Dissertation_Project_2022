- <i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill...
- TAYLOR: <i>She was kicked</i>

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,430
out of her third home because
her foster mother accused her

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,764
of trying to seduce
her husband.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,391
A week later,
that house burned down.

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,143
- You did those things?
- You can't believe

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,644
- a fucking word he says!
- Jade, watch out!

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,229

NURSE:
Before we put him out,

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,399
he wrote you this note.

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,443
Said it was
important.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,111
- Did you talk to him?
- DUKE: No.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,738
Taylor came to see me in jail.

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,740
You really fucked me this time!

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,996
Your membership to the club
has been revoked.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,748
It's because I'm ill.

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,958
It was you.

17
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,710
You seduced

18
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>my child.</i>

19
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>Do you think
that I would be satisfied</i>

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,299
just getting you kicked
out of a country club?

21
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,761
I am just getting started,
bitch.

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,345
Dad always said
that you were vindictive.

23
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,972
I am still your mother.

24
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:59,100
No, from now on, you're just
some lady that I used to know.

25
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,186
- You pulling out?
- Not yet.

26
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,813

BETH ANN: Our daughter
died because of me.

30
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,947
I'm the one who's responsible.

31
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,991
The last time I slept
with your husband

32
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,659
<i>was the day your child died.</i>

33
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>While you were coming
in the front door,</i>

34
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>I ran around the side
of the house.</i>

35
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,458
Did Rob know
you had not closed the gate?

36
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,002
I called him that
night and I told him.

37
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,337
What can I do for you?

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,797
I need to buy a gun.

So, what do you think?

58
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,921
(exhales) It's impressive.
Square footage?

59
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,423
5,000.

60
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,757
Give or take.

61
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,217
Four big bedrooms upstairs.

62
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,052
Got kids?

63
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,554
We had a little girl.

64
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,306
Her name was Emily.

65
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,099
Was?

66
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,393
Could you excuse us a moment?

67
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,111
You've got to stop telling total
strangers our daughter died.

68
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,821
He asked me a question.

69
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,823
It's been over a year.

70
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,159
How are we gonna
move forward in our lives

71
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,202
if we keep talking
about what happened?

72
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,829
I don't even understand
what we're doing here.

73
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,456
The house we have now is fine.

74
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,916
It's got
too many memories.

75
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,001
We need a fresh start.

76
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,254
I mean, this could be
good for us.

77
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,423
Don't you want to find a way
to be happy again?

78
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,383
Of course I do.

79
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,260
Well, then let me buy this
for you.

80
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,346
If you do that,
I'll spend every day

81
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,307
just trying to put the smile
back on your face.

82
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,310
The one I fell in love with.

83
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,106
I guess we could be happy here.

84
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,192
Of course we can.

85
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,655
Now where's that smile I love?

86
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,240
I bought a gun yesterday.

87
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,160
What?

88
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,162
I'd left an appointment
at my cancer doctors,

89
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,456
and I passed the most
adorable gun shop.

90
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,085
And I bought this
little revolver.

91
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,337
Why do we need a gun?

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,172
There have been robberies
in the neighborhood.

93
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,840
Mrs. Betz on the corner?

94
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,510
Some thief smashed her
window, reached in,

95
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,887
and took her new purse
right off her end table.

96
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,722
- Have I met her?
- Anyway,

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,224
I don't feel safe.

98
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
So I got this gun, and
I'm storing it here.

99
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,603
And I've already
put in the bullets.

100
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,066
You're keeping the gun loaded?

101
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,859
If someone attacks us,
I don't think

102
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,530
we'd want to waste time
looking for bullets. Do you?

103
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,198
This is a nice street.

104
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,867
Nothing bad is going
to happen to us.

105
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,995
You never know.

106
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,211
So...

107
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,838
what do you think?

108
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,715
You were right
to bring us here.

109
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,591
So many possibilities.

110
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,051
Yes, the floor plan's good,

111
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,053
but really,
the color of the walls...

112
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,055
Before we go any
further, state law

113
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,933
compels me to disclose
that a murder took place here.

114
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,727
Someone was murdered
in this house?

115
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,186
Was it the decorator?

116
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,688
- Oh. (laughs)
- (door opens)

117
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,566
Simone!

118
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,943
- Naomi!
- (exclaims)

119
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,529
I saw your car out front.

120
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,740
Tell me that you are
buying this place.

121
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
I live a block away.

122
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,410
We would be neighbors.

123
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,705
Karl, this is my friend
Naomi from the country club.

124
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,749
You must be
the dashing new boyfriend

125
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,250
I keep hearing about.

126
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,626
Not <i>just</i> the boyfriend.

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,546
- I've, uh, been promoted.
- Stop.

128
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,548
You're engaged?

129
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,051
Oh, well, now you definitely
need a bigger house.

130
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,720
- And who's this charming young man?
- Tommy.

131
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:50,433
This is my son Tommy.

132
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,562
Tommy, this is Simone.

133
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,773
You're pretty.

134
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,107
- Oh.
- (laughs)

135
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,734
Kids say the
cutest things.

136
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,278
Oh, hands off, young man.
She's spoken for.

137
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,281
Oh, Simone, please tell me
you'll take the house.

138
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,785
I'd absolutely kill
to have you here.

139
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
Oh, it would be fun,
wouldn't it?

140
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,538
Being close to my best friend.

141
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,260
(tires screeching)

142
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,970
Simone!

143
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,977
(engine hissing)

144
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,105
(both panting)

145
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,858
Are you all right?

146
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,320
What happened?

148
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,863
(bystanders clamoring)

149
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,865
My mother tried
to kill you.

150
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,867
What?

151
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,328
Oh, my God, is she alive?

152
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,957
Tommy.

153
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,960
Someone call a doctor!

154
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,878
- Okay.
- And the police!

155
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,185
So... what do you think?

156
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,149
I mean... I love it.
I say, let's do it.

157
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,152
- What?
- I want to buy this house.

158
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,738
Can I talk with my husband for
a moment in private, please?

159
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,575
Take your time.

160
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,910
What?

161
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,537
Dude, are you crazy?

162
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,747
Are you cra...? Did
you not see that pool?

163
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,374
And that kitchen is huge.

164
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,835
Yeah, and it needs a complete
remodel. We can't afford that.

165
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,211
D-Don't worry about
the money, all right?

166
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,213
My career is taking off.

167
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,340
The reviews for <i>Jenny from
Yesterday</i> are through the roo.

168
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,718
Yeah, I know,
but even so, it's still risky.

169
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,554
Risky? Are you hearing
yourself right now?

170
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,556
- Do you know who you sound like?
- Who?

171
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,058
Me... when we were talking
about having an open marriage?

172
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,518
Okay, that's not
the same thing.

173
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,395
No. I was...
I was nervous.

174
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,230
I was unsure that we could make
it work, but you convinced me.

175
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,025
And now our life is so
much more exciting for it.

176
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,527
Now think about how much even
more exciting our life would be

177
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,738
- with that fucking kitchen, right?
- (both laughing)

178
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,781
Oh, sweetie,
you still have that cold?

179
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,533
It's fine. I'm good. I'm good.

180
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,452
Just, Taylor, trust me.

181
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,204
Okay? Believe in me.

182
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,123
I promise you
I will not let you down.

183
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,459
Take it slow.

184
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,086
- God, everything hurts.
- (sighs)

185
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,755
Well, here's something
to ease the pain.

186
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,382
I went by the house.
All of Jade's stuff is gone.

187
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,093
That was fast.

188
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,554
Yeah. Well, she knows
we're onto her.

189
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,307
She can't just stick around,
waiting for the cops to show up.

190
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,268
Oh, speaking of the house,

191
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,771
I, uh, got you
a little something.

192
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,272
A business card?

193
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,816
Yeah. For Lamar's Realtor.

194
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,486
If it's okay with you,
I want to sell the house.

195
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,905
Really?

196
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,490
Yeah, it just
feels like

197
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,242
every wrong turn
we've made can be traced back

198
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,118
to the moment where I talked you
into buying it.

199
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,620
No house...
wouldn't have

200
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,997
met Jade. No Jade, no relapse.

201
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,334
I mean, we'd lose
a lot of stress.

202
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,044
The mortgage payments alone.

203
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,505
(laughs)

204
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,924
- Look at that smile.
- (laughs)

205
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,094
All right. So how much
downsizing are we up for?

206
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,930
Townhouse? Condo?

207
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,307
Fuck it. Let's just buy a field.

208
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,850
We can pitch a tent.

209
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,644
- Love it.
- (laughs)

210
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,479
Tent in a field.
We'd be living the dream.

211
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:27,275
And the best part about moving...
Jade won't be able to find us.

212
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,527
Where do you think she went?

213
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,362
I don't know.

214
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,031
Let's just hope she's
a thousand miles away by now.

215
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,161
Who's Duke?

216
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,372
My grandfather.

217
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:45,001
Grammy Sue gave that to him for
their first wedding anniversary.

218
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,169
He wore it every day,
but he never wound it.

219
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,796
He always used
to say that

220
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,592
"When I met my Susie, it
was like time stood still."

221
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,137
Sweet.

222
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,180
Give you 35.

223
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,140
Hundred?

224
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,891
No. Dollars.

225
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,060
It's worth much more than that.

226
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,520
Sentimental-wise, maybe.

227
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,523
Cash-wise, it's worth $35.

228
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,692
- Well, I need more.
- All right.

229
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,321
I'll throw in
an extra five for the story.

230
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,574
And 'cause I like your... face.

231
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,416
How about a grand?

232
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
I don't like
your face that much.

233
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,210
Okay, well, then
a couple hundred.

234
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,004
- Honey, I told you...
- Please.

235
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,256
You don't understand
what I've been through lately.

236
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,508
I've lost everything,
and I just need a little...

237
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,053
What you need is to give
the waterworks a rest.

238
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,055
I made you my offer,
so either take it

239
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
or get the hell out.

240
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,361

I'm calling the cops!

241
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,031

244
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,845
Morning, Mary.
I hope I'm not interrupting?

245
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,806
No, not at all. Ralph
just left for work.

246
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,474
I know. I waited for him to go.

247
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,975
I need to speak
to you privately.

248
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,144
- What's going on?
- I've thought of a way

249
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,313
to solve our respective
marital difficulties.

250
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,108
You have?

251
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,027
I've come up with a plan
on how to kill our husbands.

252
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,989
Please invite me in.

253
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,492
This is the sort of thing
we should discuss over coffee.

254
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,464
That's the plan.

255
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,466
Any thoughts?

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,093
It's crazy.

257
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,345
- We'd never get away with it.
- But we would.

258
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,305
Think about it.
Technically speaking,

259
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,433
we wouldn't be doing
anything illegal.

260
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,268
How could we be sure
that Rob and Ralph

261
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,436
would even swallow the bait?

262
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,104
That's the beauty of the plan.

263
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,480
It's tailor-made to fit

264
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,066
their horribly predictable
personalities.

265
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,988
What if someone discovers
what we've done?

266
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,282
I don't plan
on telling anyone.

267
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,450
Do you?

268
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,451
I don't know.

269
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
Ralph deserves to die.

270
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,206
And... after everything
Rob's put you through,

271
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,834
he's just as bad.

272
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,961
But the Bible says,

273
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,338
"Thou shalt not kill."

274
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,258
God might not understand.

275
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,801
Maybe not.

276
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
But I'm sure God's wife will.

277
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,557
Now, what do you say?

278
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh. Tommy.

00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,522

280

00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,759
I'm sure we'll all be back in
the emergency room by dessert.

357
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,886
(chuckles)
You are such a bitch.

358
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,763
I should hope so.

359
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,391
I did study with a master.

360
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,226
Oh, I heard the doorbell.

361
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,144
Who was it?

362
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,104
Cole stopped by to
pick up the painting.

363
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,107
Oh, Lord,
I feel so dreadful about that.

364
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,776
I-I know how much
you love that piece.

365
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,111
It's okay.

366
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,779
At least
we can pay the mortgage now.

367
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,574
Or most of it.

368
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,785
(choked up):
I am s... I am so sorry.

369
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,287
Stop it.

370
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,123
We are fine.

371
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,585
Uh, you are right.

372
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,254
We are, uh, two...

373
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,797
bitch goddesses.

374
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,091
And we will
not be defeated.

375
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,343
Now turn.

376
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,727
(birds chirping)

377
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,150
(doorbell rings)

378
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,653
(sighs)

379
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,865
♪ ♪

380
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,328
(sighs)

381
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,999
What did I tell
all you this morning

382
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,042
before we left the house?

383
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,294
Huh?
What did I say?

384
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,171
Not to embarrass you.

385
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,341
I can never go back
to that store ever again

386
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,051
because of what
you little freaks did

387
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,344
to that poor mannequin.

388
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,471
(all giggling)

389
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,808
Go inside.

390
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,727
Now!

391
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,938
(kids chattering and laughing)

392
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,524
Hello.

393
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm not sure
if you remember who I am.

394
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,653
I know who you are.

395
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,405
Can you tell me who <i>you</i> are?

396
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,242
Let's start with the headline,
hon.

397
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm not Rob Stanton's wife.

398
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,457
Come on in.

399
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,919
I think it's time
someone told you the truth.

400
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,220
Thank you, Lamar.

401
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
Your support
means a lot.

402
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,683
Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,893
I will see you
on the other side, man.

404
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,187
Okay. Bye.

405
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,274
So, how you
gonna stay busy

406
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,401
while I'm at rehab?

407
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,779
Guessing the short answer
is "girls, girls, girls"?

408
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,613
(chuckles)

409
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,533
Well, funny you
should mention that.

410
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,495
I thought maybe we could rethink
the whole open marriage thing.

411
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,414
- Really?
- Yeah.

412
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,332
You know, we should
focus on us for a while.

413
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,292
Go to therapy.

414
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,418
And three's a crowd.

415
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
Especially
in couples counseling.

416
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,255
Okay.

417
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,923
- What, you don't like that idea?
- No.

418
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,091
It's just...

419
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,467
I mean, obviously,

420
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,344
your sexuality
is really important.

421
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,430
And...
I just don't want you to have

422
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,973
to give any part of that up.

423
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,642
It is important to me.

424
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,977
But like I've always said,

425
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,896
my love story is with you.

426
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,732
And I would
choose you over

427
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,401
a few casual hookups
any day of the week.

428
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,113
It would just be
you and me?

429
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,240
Forsaking all others?

430
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,451
Till death do us part.

431
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,455
(exhales)

432
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,290
Did we just become
Republicans?

433
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,375
I think we did.

434
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,962
Hector, hi.

435
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,422
Come on in.

436
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,176
Karl is taking a nap.
Should I wake him?

437
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,969
Uh, no.
Actually, uh,

438
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm here to see you.

439
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,973
Oh. What's going on?

440
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,642
Remember last Sunday,
when I took Karl

441
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,809
to that brunch at Harold's?

442
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,811
Yes.
Thank you for driving him.

443
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,147
So, Harold
called me today.

444
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,317
He thinks Karl stole some pills
from his medicine cabinet.

445
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,902
What kind of pills?

446
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,195
Sleeping pills.

447
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,030
And the same thing
happened two weeks ago

448
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,324
when we went
to Billy's for bridge.

449
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,373
I see.

450
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,833
Karl puts on a brave face,

451
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,711
but I know
how depressed he's been.

452
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,340
And I'm just so worried.

453
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,175
You did the right thing
telling me.

454
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,345
Simone, I'm so sorry
to dump this on you.

455
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,974
But you've always been the only
one who can get through to him.

456
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,061
I will take care of it.

457
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,857
Thank you.

458
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,319
So, while you copy the
letter in your handwriting,

459
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,030
I'll be upstairs
cleaning out your closet.

460
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,700
You said Ralph gets
home around 6:45?

461
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,702
Sometimes as early as 6:30.

462
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,871
Rob gets home around 6:15,
and it's almost 5:00.

463
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,416
We need to
get cracking.

464
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,917
Beth Ann?

465
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,422
When Ralph reads this...

466
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,924
he will absolutely get violent.

467
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,385

Wearing that?

494
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,746
Well, just because
I have to shop with the frumps

495
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,623
doesn't mean I have
to dress like them.

496
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,916
Can I get you anything?

497
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,795
Oh, yes, actually,
um, I could use

498
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,797
a hundred sleeping pills
to replace the ones

499
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,757
you took out of my dresser.

500
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,759
You noticed.

501
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,177
That was fast.

502
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,137
Yes, last year you
were angry with me

503
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,431
because I didn't take
enough pills to kill myself,

504
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,475
and now you won't
let me have any.

505
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,186
You need to choose a policy
and stick to it, my girl.

506
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,815
We have to fight this disease.
We can't give into it.

507
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,109
Have you really forgotten
how bad my last bout

508
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,693
of pneumonia was?

509
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,197
I wasn't sure I was
leaving the hospital.

510
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,782
But you did,
and now you're fine.

511
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,619
Darling, I'm not fine.

512
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,039
If my T cells were people,

513
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,666
I couldn't get up a bridge game,

514
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,045
so please, <i>please</i>
give me the pills back.

515
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,173
I already washed them
down the sink.

516
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,383
Well, then, you'll just force me

517
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,009
to do something more gruesome.

518
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,846
So, hang myself
or blow my brains out.

519
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,847
You choose.

520
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,641
So help me, if you do
anything disfiguring,

521
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,351
I will give you an
open-casket funeral

522
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,146
with no makeup and
fluorescent lighting.

523
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,858
Dear God,

524
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,069
I married the devil herself.

525
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:12,367
Oh, I know we won't be
together always,

526
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,121
but why subtract even a day
we could share?

527
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,379
Fine. Fine.

528
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,755
You win.

529
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,053
Actually, um, I'm going
to a birthday party

530
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,221
this afternoon.

531
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,264
Maybe you'd like to join me.

532
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,765
- It's for Jimmy Loftus.
- (gasps)

533
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,767
Oh, I'd love to see him again.
He's always a hoot.

534
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,227
How is he doing?

535
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,021
Well, I'm afraid he's
had a bit of a setback.

536
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,230
He's in the hospital.

537
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,940
Oh, no.

538
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,400
Yes, the party's
in his room.

539
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,778
If you come, I'm sure it
would lift his spirits.

540
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,114
Oh, I'd love to come.

541
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,576
I'm so glad.

542
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,875
ELI:
Oh, thank God.

543
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,587
- All right.
- Honey...

544
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,340
Come here, you.

545
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,299
Mmm.

546
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,759
- Ow. Ooh, my ribs.
- Oh.

547
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,093
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no. No, no.

548
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,762
Don't stop, don't stop.
I can take it.

549
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,722
(laughs)

550
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,020
(panting)

551
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,150
I thought you said Jade
took the dog when she left.

552
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,110
She did.

553
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,112
(clattering)

554
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,744
Hey.

555
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,955
(quietly):
Hey.

556
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,791
- What are you doing here?
- I'm making dinner.

557
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,751
Oh.

558
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,255
Okay.

559
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,131
I think you need to leave.

560
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,759
I know things got a little funky
for a minute there,

561
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,302
but there's no reason
that we can't go back

562
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,762
to the way we were before.

563
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,514
Oh, I think there are
a lot of reasons.

564
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,641
- Yeah, Jade, please...
- Her name's not Jade.

565
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,017
Who cares?

566
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,936
Am I not allowed
to reinvent myself?

567
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,062
I mean, fuck.

568
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,317
Okay, you know what,
let's just all settle down.

569
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,654
You guys act like
everything that happened

570
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,322
is my fault; it's not.

571
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,657
I could have gone
to Europe,

572
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,659
but you begged me
to stay.

573
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,786
You pretended to love me,

574
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:24,499
and you promised that you would
always take care of me.

575
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,002
(voice breaking):
It's not fair.

576
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,629
You're right.

577
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,798
You're right,
it's not fair.

578
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,301
Okay, just stop.

579
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,344
I don't believe
one thing about you.

580
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,513
Least of all your tears.

581
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,348
I didn't pretend
to love you, I <i>did.</i>

582
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,517
But that's because I didn't know
who you really are.

583
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,185
You tried to trick us.

584
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,354
You played us, and you lost.

585
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,814
It's done.

586
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,441
Now get out.

587
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,904
I'll go...

588
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,614
but you have to pay me first.

589
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,700
You think you can shake us down?

590
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,826
- Honey.
- It costs money

591
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,202
to start over.

592
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,704
We're not aiding
and abetting a criminal.

593
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,997
You owe me.

594
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,708
Eli sold our script
for a million dollars.

595
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,501
Give me ten grand, and I'll go.

596
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm not gonna pay you to leave.
I'm just gonna call the cops.

597
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,927
All right, you know what,
let's just hold on a second.

598
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,721
Okay? You know what
I'm gonna do?

599
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,389
I'm gonna go talk to her.
We're gonna work this out.

600
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,932
I mean, after all,
you've been through a lot,

601
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,392
but you're not a bad person.

602
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,727
Right? No, no, okay.

603
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,936
(whispers harshly):
How could you leave me alone

604
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,937
with that psychopath?

605
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,397
I can't find my fucking phone.

606
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,399
Where is it?

607
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,193
(smoke alarm beeping)

608
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,527
Smoke alarm.

609
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,447
She's burning down
the goddamn house.

610
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,995
(sighs)

611
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,084
Hey.

612
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,339
So what, exactly,
is Jimmy's prognosis?

613
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,257
Well, whatever it is,
this is a party,

614
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,759
so please try to smile.

615
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,553
Darling, I can smile
through anything.

616
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,392
Karl, Simone, you made it.

617
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,727
Hello, hello.
Oh, let us through,

618
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,062
we want to see
the birthday boy.

619
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,147
(monitor beeping steadily)

620
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,487
KEN:
Jimmy, look who's here.

621
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,822
It's Karl and Simone.

622
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
Happy birthday, Jimmy.

623
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,118
And you should see
what Simone is wearing.

624
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,577
I think it's Lagerfeld.

625
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,621
Uh, Karl, Simone,

626
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,624
I wanted you to meet Jimmy's mom
and his sister Terry.

627
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,626
They just got in
from Iowa.

628
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,503
It is so lovely
to meet you both.

629
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,671
I can't tell you how
comforting it's been

630
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,423
to find Jimmy here
surrounded by

631
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,133
such loving friends.

632
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,676
KEN: Oh, you ain't seen nothing
yet, honey.

633
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,803
I made my famous
carrot cake.

634
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,638
You are having
a piece, Mr. Jim,

635
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:47,684
even if they have to puree it
and drip it into your arm.

636
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,020
Can he hear us?

637
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,772
Of course he can.

638
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,192
Everyone's here now.
Time to sing.

639
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,820
Here we go.

640
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,866
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

641
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,786

to you ♪

642
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,166

643
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,667
Excuse me.

644
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,714
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

645
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,948
I don't understand how
he got so sick so quickly.

646
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,367
This is the disease.

647
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,372
I've watched it happen
to Clive, to Harry,

648
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,541
to Alistair...

649
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,503
It's just horrifying.

650
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,380
You know, Jimmy
once told me

651
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,925
he was scared of
ending up like this.

652
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,305
Connected to tubes,
wasting away.

653
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:13,811
- But here he is.
- (gasps weakly)

654
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,440
You know what
I'm driving at.

655
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,234
You're not that sick.

656
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,277
Yet.

657
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,324
But we've seen my future.

658
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,080
I would rather choose life,

659
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,167
but life is...

660
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,337
...off the table.

661
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,216
The only thing
I can choose

662
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,095
is when to die and...

663
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,556
how.

664
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,225
I brought you here today

665
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,811
because I needed
you to understand.

666
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,774
Do you?

667
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,318
(sobs)

668
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,455
Thank you.

669
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,762
Rob.

670
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,763
You're home.

671
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,058
And starving.
Is dinner ready?

672
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
The day got away from me.

673
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,313
I had to order Chinese takeout.

674
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,523
But it's Thursday.

675
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,817
I was looking forward
to meatloaf.

676
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,820
If it helps, I made you
a shaker of martinis.

677
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,947
You could have a few
while we wait.

678
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,325
Now you're talkin'.

679
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,286
Thanks.

680
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,177
Hi.

681
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,678
Are you Taylor Harding?

682
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,514
Yeah. Wow, you got here fast.
Come on in.

683
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,558
Eli, the police are here.

684
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,518
Already?

685
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,314
I'm sorry, were you
expecting us?

686
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,316
Yeah, we reported
a break-in.

687
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,525
That was, like,
ten minutes ago.

688
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,694
We're not here about
any break-in.

689
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,197
We came to talk about
Duke Riley.

690
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,407
What about Duke?

691
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,742
You filed a police report
six weeks ago

692
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,077
accusing him of assault.

693
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,537
- Yes.
- And then four days ago,

694
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,705
you posted his bail.

695
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,041
I did. Why are you asking?

696
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,668
Duke Riley was murdered
yesterday.

697
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,712
His landlord found his body
in his apartment.

698
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,382
He had been repeatedly stabbed.

699
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,010
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

700
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,264
I think we do.

701
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,688
Whoa, this'll be
my third one.

702
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,523
Oh, who's counting?

703
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,236
Mrs. Stanton, are you trying
to get me drunk?

704
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,072
I just wanted you
to be relaxed

705
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,032
so we could have
a little chat.

706
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,118
About what?

707
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,871
About the day our daughter died.

708
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,423
This will do it?

709
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,926
Yes, just the one dose.

710
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:36,264
And you won't feel any pain,
you'll just... sleep?

711
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,349
So I'm told.

712
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,602
Are you sure you don't
want Hector here?

713
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,064
No, no. We've, um,
we've said our goodbyes.

714
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,066
I-I mean,
he wanted to be here, but...

715
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,818
well, he's so bloody emotional.

716
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,238
The mere mention of my death, he
starts wailing like a car alarm.

717
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:56,033
Be nice. He loves you.

718
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,786
I know.

719
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,955
But to be honest, uh,

720
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,750
I just wanted it
to be the two of us.

721
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,754
You deserve to have
more than just me.

722
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,674
You should have a huge, glorious
party to send you off.

723
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:16,596
You are a glorious party,
all by yourself.

724
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,016
I knew that the first moment

725
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,518
I laid eyes on you.

726
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,651
You'll always be
the love of my life.

727
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,824
So, what happens now?

728
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,827
Well, uh, firstly, I...

729
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,538
I'd like you to change
into the red gown

730
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,540
I bought you in Venice.

731
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,001
(scoffs)
What's wrong with this one?

732
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,587
I prefer the red.

733
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,507
All right.

734
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,969
But this is the last time
I'll let you edit my wardrobe.

735
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,890
When you've changed,
come down to the living room.

736
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,017
I have a nice surprise for you.

737
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,481
I don't want
to talk about Emily.

738
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:12,235
Well, I do. I've been thinking
about that day a lot lately.

739
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,945
And I've remembered something.

740
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,363
What's that?

741
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,741
I absolutely locked the gate

742
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,077
after I brought in
the trash can.

743
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,246
Huh.

744
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,498
Well, you must not have.

745
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,292
How else did Emily
get out into the street?

746
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,380
Perhaps you could come up
with another explanation.

747
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,090
Think.

748
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,970
I'm not feeling well.

749
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,223
My darling.

750
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:47,687
You can't possibly imagine how
important this moment is to me.

751
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,773
Please.

752
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,902
Did anything happen that day
you haven't told me?

753
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,918
No.

754
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,006
Thank you.

755
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,091
For what?

756
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,928
You've made this all
so much easier.

757
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,930
Well, she's obviously dangerous.

758
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,724
You might want to think
about staying someplace

759
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,434
for a few days
until we locate her.

760
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,394
We'll check into
a hotel tonight.

761
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,063
FEMALE DETECTIVE: And we'll put a car
on the street outside until you leave.

762
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,648
Don't worry.
She won't get past us.

763
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,442
- Good night.
- TAYLOR: Night.

764
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
(exhales)

765
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,779
Okay, I was trying to be cool
in front of the detectives,

766
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,781
but oh, my God,
Jade killed Duke.

767
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,783
- I know. I know.
- Wait, do you think she's actually gonna come back here?

768
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,744
TAYLOR: We can't stick around
long enough to find out.

769
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,579
- What about the dog?
- We'll take it with us.

770
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,623
You feed her first,
I'll go start packing.

771
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,124
- Okay. All right. Come on, Teacup.
- Okay.

772
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,484
Mary, I'm home.

773
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,569
(sighs)

774
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,571
Bring me a beer!

775
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,324
And I want it
in a mug this time.

776
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,749
Mary?

777
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,045
Mary?

778
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,514
MARY: <i>Dearest Ralph.
I haven't been happy for quite some time.</i>

779
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,141
<i>But that's not why
I've decided to leave you.</i>

780
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,979
<i>I've met someone else.
A man who makes me happy.</i>

781
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,356
<i>So I'm leaving you
for Rob Stanton.</i>

782
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,858
<i>He loves me in a way
you never could.</i>

783
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,361
<i>Your ex-wife, Mary.</i>

784
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,746
- (quietly): Shit.
- (drawer shuts)

785
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,638
(gun clicks)

786
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,652
(footsteps receeding)

787
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,912
(rings)

788
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,457
Aren't you gonna get that?

789
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,959
Must have been a wrong number.

790
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,130
Well, when's the Chinese food
getting here? I'm hungry.

791
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,799
I'm sure it'll arrive
any second.

792
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,926
(pounding on door)

793
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,219
See?

794
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,222
Wait.

795
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,017
Are you sure that's the delivery
guy? He sounds angry.

796
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,937
Who else could it be?

797
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,119
You are so beautiful.

798
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,497
Look who's talking.

799
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,627
Are you ready?

800
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,424
Not just yet.

801
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,926
Have you changed your mind?

802
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,136
No. No.

803
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,849
But I would love
just one more dance.

804
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,977
A tango?

805
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
What else?

806
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,150
ELI: Babe, what should I pack?

807
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,319
Just the essentials.

808
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,574
How is this essential?

809
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,659
Look, just 'cause
we're going into hiding

810
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,660
doesn't mean we can't look good.

811
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,120
Hey, have you seen my laptop?

812
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,871
I think it's downstairs.
Check the dining room table.

813
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,456
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- All right.

814
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,833
So it's true.

815
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,501
What are you doing here?

816
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,670
I won't be here long.

817
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,046
I just want to know why.

818
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,173
Now is not a good time.
You have to go.

819
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,550
What the hell?

820
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,551
I'm sorry, Rob.

821
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,346
Uh... honey, this is...

822
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,515
Don't bother lying. She knows
that we were having an affair.

823
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,016
- What?
- BETH ANN: Please.

824
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,144
- You have to go!
- You know how I always talk to you

825
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,812
about my friend Sheila?

826
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,105
This is Sheila.

827
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
(groans)

828
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,652
Uh, okay...

829
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,197
I came to the diner that day
to confront you.

830
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,409
But you were so nice. And you
said we could be friends.

831
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,660
Hold on.

832
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,328
You're friends with my mistress?

833
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,663
Fiancée.

834
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,248
Can we talk about this later?

835
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,541
What could you have
been thinking?

836
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,585
Oh, you're a fine one to talk.

837
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,503
You've been having
an affair for months.

838
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,172
You've been planning
on leaving me.

839
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,674
Oh, my God.
Do you even have cancer?

840
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,926
Cancer? You have cancer?

841
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,596
Well, this is just awkward.

842
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,764

Hi there.

862
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,170
You must be Beth Ann?

863
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,838
You must be Simone.
Come in.

864
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:48,008
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

865
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,177
I have the keys
around here somewhere.

866
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,012
Let me look.

867
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,847
One of the reasons
I wanted to meet

868
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,016
was because I had a question.

869
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,392
It's a bit awkward.

870
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,019
What would you like to know?

871
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,437
The realtor told me

872
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,856
that someone was murdered
in this house?

873
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,858
It's true.
My husband was killed...

874
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,026
right where you're standing.

875
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,028
- Oh, dear.
- Our neighbor broke in

876
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,738
and accused Rob of
sleeping with his wife.

877
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,323
Shot him dead.

878
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,492
He was executed last year.
So sad.

879
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,245
Aunt Beth, I'm packed.
Can we go?

880
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,331
In a sec.
Elsie, this is Simone,

881
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,333
- the woman who bought our house.
- Hi, there.

882
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,710
You're so pretty.
She's your niece?

883
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,171
The daughter of my friend,
April Warner.

884
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,674
But I've been helping take care
of her since she was a baby.

885
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,509
April is a singer, you know.

886
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,052
My mom's gonna be on Broadway.

887
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,179
That's why we sold the house.
We're moving to New York.

888
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,430
Oh, how exciting.

889
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,890
Here are your keys.

890
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:40,936
I hope to have a very
happy life in this house.

891
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,063
A happy life
isn't hard to come by.

892
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,650
The trick is
to not regret the choices

893
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,403
you made along the way.

894
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,363
Yes.

895
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,365
Well...

896
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,242
good luck with everything.

897
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,786
Likewise.
Take care of my house.

898
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,956
I'll give it lots of love.

899
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,251
There you go.

900
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,087
Thank you.

901
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,922
I just know that we're
gonna love living here.

902
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,590
I certainly hope so.

903
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,467
So when did you
buy the house?

904
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,136
'74.

905
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,013
But after my husband died,
I rented the house out.

906
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,767
Then it was the headquarters
for my foundation.

907
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,061
I raise money for AIDS research.

908
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,438
Yeah, we've read up on you.

909
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,981
You've done such
amazing work.

910
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,608
I ended up living
a very rich life,

911
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,777
once I stopped worrying
about money.

912
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,322
Paulo, I'm ready.

913
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,284
Is that a Thomas J. Harte?

914
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,287
- Oh, you know his work?
- TAYLOR: Sure.

915
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,581
- Yeah, we saw a show of his at the Whitney last year.
- That's right, yeah.

916
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,751
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

917
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,836
I always hoped Tommy
would go far.

918
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,590
Tommy?
Is he a friend of yours?

919
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:55,635
A friend?
You could say that.

920
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,889
My face is tattooed on his ass.

921
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,477
Paulo, push.

922
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,984
(sighs) Well, it's been
lovely to meet you, Taylor.

923
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,694
And just know that
Andrew and I will

924
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,780
take wonderful care
of your home.

925
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,115
Aw, well, I hope
you'll enjoy it.

926
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,159
We will.

927
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,038
And I'm sorry for everything
that happened to you here.

928
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,791
Can't imagine what
you went through.

929
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,959
It was an awful night.

930
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,461
But it could have been worse.

931
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,838
So you really have
a rifle collection?

932
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,174
Yeah. They're all
in that box over there.

933
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,718
Hey, check this out.

934
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,721
This is me on safari
in Africa.

935
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,015
- Look at that.
- No way.

936
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,518
Well, I-I never knew there were
Jews that were into hunting.

937
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,853
We exist. But it's not
as cruel to the animals,

938
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,563
because we miss so frequently.

939
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,984
TAYLOR:
Oh, before I forget,

940
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,486
here are your keys.

941
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,239
Thank you.

942
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,657
So, what about
the two of you?

943
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,033
Found a new place to live?

944
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,660
- Uh, yeah. Well, actually...
- (phone buzzing)

945
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,037
...we're moving back
to our old condo.

946
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,915
After living in a mansion.
That is some serious downsizing.

947
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,709
Yeah. For us, it turns out...

948
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,837
Less is more.

949
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,213
Well, best of luck
to both of you.

950
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,090
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

951
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,220
They seem like nice people.

952
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,563
Are you gonna miss the house?

953
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,357
It's just a building.

954
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,526
Home is where my family is.

955
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,423
Back to the hotel?

956
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,510
Yes. I'm ready
for my massage now.

957
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,348
(chuckles)

958
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,777
All right.
Condo, here we come.

959
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,615
It's gonna be nice.
Just the three of us.

960
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,159
(barks)

961
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,877
Honey?

962
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,673
(gunshot)

963
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:49,140
