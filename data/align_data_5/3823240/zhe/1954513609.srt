1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,170
我喜欢你的衬衫
I like your suit.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,710
谢谢 为了工作 我买了几套新衣服
Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,680
知道你未婚妻的工作就是
How does it feel knowing your fiancee's job

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,810
打扮时髦地出去和医生调情
is to go out and flirt with doctors,

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,480
而你穿着旧衣服坐在这里...
looking like that, while you sit here, you know...

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,520
是什么感觉?
looking like this?

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,240
她不会和医生调情的
She doesn't flirt with doctors.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,360
对 我很专业的
Yeah. It's all very professional.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,410
你知道你弯腰的时候 我能看到你的胸吧?
You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,190
知道 很好
Okay, good.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,780
说到新工作 暗物质
Speaking of new careers, how are things going

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,830
研究得怎么样啊 Sheldon?
with dark matter, Sheldon?

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,450
我得说这是暗物质研究领域历史上
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,200
- 最激动人心的时刻  - 哦
- in the history of the field.  - Oh.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,240
有什么进展?
What's going on?

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,840
因为我开始研究了
I started doing it.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
知道吗 政府资助了
You know, the government funded

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,760
有史以来最大的试验 用来探测暗物质
the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,210
对呀
Oh, yeah,

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,460
我还看到了... 他们要派研究小组
I've read about that... they're sending research teams

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,930
- 去那些废弃的盐矿  - 要知道 Sheldon
- down into abandoned salt mines.  - You know, Sheldon,

22
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,100
如果我们申请加入那种小组
if we apply to be one of those teams,

23
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,570
我们就成为了某个伟大成就的奠基人...
we could be on the ground floor of something big...

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,220
而不只是理论物理和理论天体物理学家了
not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.

25
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,280
等等... 你们要去矿洞里工作?
Wait, hang on... you guys are gonna work in a mine?

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,490
- 不行吗?  - 我们上次
- Why not?  - You had

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,400
去洗个车 你就恐慌症发作了
a panic attack when we went through the car wash.

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,280
也许你说的情绪 应该是我对你竟然去洗东西
Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,730
表露出的惊讶之情
at you having something cleaned.

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,190
我觉得Penny的意思是 你们两个进矿洞工作
I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two

31
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,880
这事有点搞笑... 就像是猫骑在扫地机器人上
in a mine is kind of funny... it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,530
如果他们害怕 就可以戴那种
If they get scared, they'll have those hats

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,160
有灯的帽子 因为那下面
with the lights on them, 'cause down there

34
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,920
一年到头都是黑漆漆的!
it's night-night all the time!

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,050
也许他们可以
Maybe they could

36
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,090
驾驶那种矿车穿梭矿洞
ride around in one of those mine carts that go,

37
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,740
咯吱咯吱咯吱
ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

38
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,680
没错 等他们看到鬼 就能快速逃掉了!
Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

39
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,310
- 他们是在取笑我们吗?  - 没错
- Are they making fun of us?  - Yup.

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,020
真怀念我年少无知的时候
I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.

41
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,690
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

42
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,020
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,660
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,340
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,850
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,600
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,420
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

48
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,200
生活大爆炸 第八季第6集

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,450
我一直以来最喜欢的游戏之一
So, one of my favorite video games of all time

53
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,950
是"旺达与巨像" 但只能在
is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,260
PS2平台玩
for PlayStation 2,

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,120
但之后他们终于开发了PS3平台版本
but then they came out with a new version

56
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,430
画质更好
for PS3 with better graphics.

57
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,210
我终于有机会能玩了
I finally got the chance to play it,

58
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,580
但不知道为什么 就是没有第一个那么好玩了
and for some reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,850
要不我们说聊瑜伽的事吧
Or something about yoga.

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,810
抱歉... 我在想工作的事情
I'm sorry... I was thinking about work.

61
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,230
我刚才在说一个游戏...
Well, I was just saying that there was this video game...

62
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,700
没错 我就是那时候开始想工作的事情的
Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work.

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,150
听着 我有点好消息要宣布
Uh, listen, I've got some good news.

64
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,150
恩
Hmm.

65
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,820
这是给你的
This is for you.

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,320
唔
Huh.

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
这是什么?
What is this?

68
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,860
你知道他们给我发了公车吧?
Well, you know how they gave me the company car?

69
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,130
我也不需要两辆车 所以就把另一辆卖掉了
Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.

70
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,960
我给你的那辆?
The one I gave you?

71
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,500
对呀 就把钱还给你了... 现在我们扯平了
Yeah. And there's your money back... and now we're even.

72
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
多好呀
How great is that?

73
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,000
是呀
Uh, yeah.

74
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,720
怎么了?
What?

75
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,790
没什么
Nothing.

76
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,510
拜托 Leonard 我知道那辆车是你体贴的表现
Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture

77
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,850
我真的很感激
and I really appreciate it,

78
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,680
但我真的不需要两辆车
but it doesn't make sense to have both.

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,570
- 说得对  - 那我该怎么办?
- You're right.  - What should I have done?

80
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,100
拍张我们坐在车里的照片 放在粉色相框里
Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,210
框上还写着"绝世好未婚夫"吗?
with puffy paint around it that says "best fiance ever"?

82
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,080
听起来也不赖
Doesn't sound that bad.

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,330
好 因为... 我就这么干了!
Well, good, because... that's why I did!

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,450
哦...
Oh...

85
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,530
谢谢
thank you.

86
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,120
- 真是... 太贴心了  - 其实也没
- That... that is so sweet.  - No, it's not

87
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,870
那么贴心... 我是用你的钱
that sweet... I paid for the frame

88
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,120
买了相框 然后还去做了个按摩
with your money and then got a massage.

89
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,510
好吧 你不必把这些钱给我的
You know what, you don't have to give me this.

90
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,880
你留着
You keep it.

91
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,100
- 为什么?  - 那辆车
- Why?  - The car

92
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,710
是个礼物... 是你当时需要的东西
was a gift... it was something you needed.

93
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,180
我很高兴能帮到你
I was happy to help you out.

94
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,970
我真的很感激 但现在我不需要了
And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it,

95
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,220
- 所以... 还给你  - 好吧
- so... here you go.  - Well,

96
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,970
这太傻了... 你不需要那辆车
this is silly... so you don't need the car,

97
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,870
但你可以用这些钱给自己买点东西
but you could use it to buy yourself something else,

98
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,030
比如... 买个能把这些钱放进去的皮夹
like a... new purse to put all this money in.

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,450
亲爱的 我可以自己买
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

100
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,900
我现在有个不错的工作
I have a good job now.

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,320
我知道 我也很为你自豪
I know, and I'm proud of you,

102
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,170
但并不意味着我就不能做点贴心的事情呀
but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice.

103
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,200
比如这个
Like this.

104
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,190
好吧 我不想和你吵架
Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.

105
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,320
- 我也不想  - 很好
- I don't, either.  - Great.

106
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,160
谢谢
Thank you.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,910
- 能把盐罐递给我吗?  - 好的
- Can you pass the salt, please?  - Sure.

108
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,140
我还以为按喜剧剧情来 可以缓解紧张的局面
In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy

109
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,010
还能促成嘿咻
and led to sex.

110
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,220
嘿 Sheldon 你忙吗?
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

111
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
我一直很忙
I'm always busy.

112
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,420
我的大脑能够高速多任务工作
This mind is capable of advanced multitasking.

113
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,390
要知道 就现在
You know, currently,

114
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,720
我正在努力解开
I'm attempting to solve

115
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,060
彭罗斯猜想
the Penrose conjecture,

116
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,640
也在写等我解开彭罗斯猜想
I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech

117
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,180
拿到诺贝尔奖时的获奖演说
for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture,

118
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,220
还在想美人鱼是怎么生孩子的
and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,190
它们不是在石头上生蛋吗?
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

120
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,940
现在我空出脑子做另一件事了
Now I've got room for another thing.

121
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,410
你有什么事?
What do you want?

122
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,160
所以我做了点小调查
So, I did a little research on what

123
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,950
在矿洞里的工作环境什么的
the conditions are like in the mines,

124
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,450
也许大家说得对...
and the guys might be right...

125
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,820
下面的生活很艰苦
sounds pretty rough down there.

126
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,790
首先 那下面很潮湿
For starters, it's very humid,

127
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,620
气温大概有一百华氏度
and about a hundred degrees.

128
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,510
我是德州来的 你是印度来的...
Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India...

129
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,590
腋下的味道我们闻得也不少 下一条
we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,260
那个矿洞还没被废弃 所以离我们不远的地方
It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions

131
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,520
- 可能会有爆破  - 好吧 我有个
- going off in the distance.  - Yeah, I have

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
患有乳糖不耐症
a lactose-intolerant roommate

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
还吃冰激凌的室友 下一条
with a taste for ice cream. Next.

134
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,390
一次得在矿下待12个小时
Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.

135
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,110
是吗? 我们总得待在那儿的
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

136
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,360
好吧 那边没有厕所...
Well, there's no toilets...

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,110
所以我们得在一个桶里解决
we'll have to do our business in a bucket.

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,980
就这么定了... 我们不去了
So it's settled... we're not doing it.

139
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,400
听着 我明白 但是... 在我们放弃
Look, I get it, but... before we pass up

140
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,010
一次绝好机会之前 我一直在想
on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about

141
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,240
Howard做宇航员训练的时候
when Howard was training to go to space,

142
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,210
他们会让他待在个模拟环境里面
they put him in a simulated environment.

143
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,500
真有趣 你是想说我们得
Interesting. You're suggesting that we recreate

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,330
模拟矿下的环境
the conditions of the mine

145
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,750
- 看看是否能忍受  - 没错
- to see if we can handle it.  - Exactly.

146
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,890
- 很好  - 那我们该去哪里模拟?
- Very well.  - So where should we do it?

147
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,090
我来谷歌"又热 又黑 又湿"
Well, I'll just Google "hot, dark and moist,"

148
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,090
看看能查到什么
see what comes up.

149
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,510
呃 Sheldon...
Uh, Sheldon...

150
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,300
噢 这里 看呀 查到了很多视频
Oh, there, well, look, there's all kinds of videos.

151
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,420
嘿 你有空吗?
Hey, you got a sec?

152
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,820
嗨 当然
Hi. Sure.

153
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,610
我是想能再谈谈这笔钱的事
I was hoping we could talk about the money again.

154
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,330
- 亲爱的 忘了这件事吧  - 不 不 不
- Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.  - No, no, no, no,

155
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,950
听我说 我知道昨晚的谈话有点尴尬
hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.

156
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,170
在我们嘿咻完之后 把一个装满钱的信封放在我的化妆台上
Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex

157
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,830
就是很尴尬啊
would count as weird.

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,250
我觉得我想到了很好的解决办法
Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.

159
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,210
我们干嘛不把钱存进我们的联名账户里?
Why don't we just put the money in a joint account?

160
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,840
这是我们第一笔共同财产
It'll be our first money together.

161
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,130
我们可以用它来办婚礼 度蜜月
We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.

162
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,050
知道吗 这主意棒极了 我很喜欢!
You know what, that's great. I love that!

163
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,770
你当然会喜欢... 我又不只是床上天才
Yeah, of course you do... I'm not just a genius in bed.

164
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,310
你当然是啦 宝贝
You sure are, baby.

165
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,810
你们想要点私人空间吗?
You two want to be alone?

166
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,700
我想告诉你 我知道你干嘛不想要这笔钱了...
I want you to know I get why you don't want the money...

167
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,450
你有了新工作 你很兴奋
you've got this new job, you're excited

168
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,090
自己能经济独立了...
about being financially independent...

169
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,090
我真的很为你自豪
and I am nothing but proud of you.

170
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,490
太谢谢你了
Oh, thank you so much.

171
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,540
听到你这么说 我真是太高兴了
It feels so good to hear you say that.

172
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,790
我只是想让你知道
And I want you to know

173
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,630
我明白我的工作改变了
that I get this job kind of changes

174
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,160
我们关系里的平衡
the balance in our relationship,

175
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,430
但是... 我不想对此漠不关心
and... I'm trying to be sensitive to that.

176
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,000
什么?
What?

177
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,510
我只是觉得也许你对这笔钱
Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up

178
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,010
这么较真 是因为我现在没那么依赖你了
on the money because I'm less reliant on you now,

179
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,340
你有点怕
and that's a little scary.

180
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,650
恩
Hmm.

181
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,180
也许吧
Maybe.

182
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,720
或者也许我只是想做点体贴的事
Or maybe I tried to do something nice

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,070
也许因为你有控制欲
and maybe you had a problem with it

184
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,710
所以对这个很有意见
because of your control issues.

185
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,250
控制欲?
Control issues?

186
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,030
也许吧
Maybe.

187
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,370
或者... 也许...
Or... maybe...

188
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,540
现在我不再是个没工作的女演员
now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress

189
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,620
付不起自己的晚饭钱
who can't pay for her own dinner,

190
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,710
这让你缺乏安全感了
that makes you a little insecure.

191
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,340
真不敢相信你竟然这么说
Well, I can't believe you'd say that.

192
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,900
你知道我对自己缺乏安全感有多没安全感的
You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.

193
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,100
我很抱歉
You know what? I'm sorry.

194
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
为钱的事情争吵真是太傻了
It's stupid to fight over money.

195
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,970
我也很抱歉 我们将来是要
Yeah, I'm sorry, too. We're about to share

196
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,540
共度余生的
the rest of our lives together.

197
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,810
这是我们的钱... 干嘛要分你我?
It's our money... who cares who has it?

198
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,480
你说得对... 干嘛要分?
You're right... who cares?

199
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,580
把那钱从我的裤子口袋里拿出来
Get that money out of my back pocket

200
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,810
不然我就掰断你的手指
or I will break your fingers.

201
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,070
这么久以来 我都不知道
All this time I never knew

202
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,700
这下面有蒸汽隧道
there were steam tunnels down here.

203
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,620
很多大学都有的
Most universities have them.

204
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,370
我本科在读的时候 在里面待了三天
When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one

205
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,660
想要加入姐妹会
pledging a sorority.

206
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,700
后来加入了吗?
Did you get in?

207
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,250
没有 她们把我给忘了
No. They forgot I was there.

208
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,550
但蒸汽真的打通了我的毛孔
But it really opened up my pores.

209
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,640
根据我的调查
Well, according to my research,

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,560
这个出入口下面的蒸汽隧道
the steam tunnels below this access point

211
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,810
应该是最接近矿洞环境的
should be the closest analog to the mines.

212
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,140
肯定会比健身房的
This is gonna be so much more accurate

213
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,310
桑拿室更为精确
than the steam room at the gym.

214
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,650
而且 在这里也不会看到
Plus, there's almost no chance

215
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,350
我们那些半裸着的同事
we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.

216
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,570
或者是全裸的 我很喜欢Howard
Or totally naked. I love Howard,

217
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,690
但这家伙真是不知耻
but the dude needs a little shame.

218
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,160
好了 Amy 这个对讲机给你
All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours.

219
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,610
如果我们遇上麻烦 我会呼叫你
If we run into any problems, I'll contact you.

220
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,830
如果发生了什么不好的事 处理流程还记得吗?
And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?

221
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,330
先救你 有时间再回去救Raj
Save you first, come back for Raj only if there's time.

222
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,000
我们不会有事的
We're going to be fine.

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,950
Sheldon 我真的很欣慰
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

224
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,710
你愿意尝试这个
you're willing to try this.

225
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,460
说真的 这真是集合了
Well, admittedly, this brushes up

226
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,790
我所有讨厌的元素 又热又小
against my well-known aversions to heat, small places,

227
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,430
地下空间
going below floor-level,

228
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,760
潮湿 舱门 梯子
dampness, hatches, ladders,

229
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,720
黑暗 回声
darkness, echoes,

230
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,140
还得用家得宝买来的桶当便壶
and eliminating in Home Depot buckets.

231
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,810
最后这条还是挺新的 但我有感觉
That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling

232
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,060
这个很有潜力变成我最讨厌的
that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.

233
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,220
我已经在出汗了
I'm sweating already.

234
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,190
作为在你下面的人 你不说我也知道
Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.

235
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,230
有多热?
How hot is it?

236
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,900
我来看看 704度?
Uh, let's see. 704?

237
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,290
不 等等 这是时间
No, wait, it's on "clock."

238
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,740
好吧 真正的答案也没好多少
No, the real answer isn't much better.

239
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,870
102度
102 degrees.

240
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,290
这就是我们想要的
Well, that's what we wanted.

241
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,040
- 和矿下的温度一样高  - 没错
- This is as hot as the mines will be.  - True.

242
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,080
Sheldon模拟下矿日志 第一段
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry one.

243
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,670
Koothrappali一直喋喋不休说废话
Koothrappali's restating of the obvious

244
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,340
快把我烦死了
is already getting on my nerves.

245
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,560
非常感谢你们能来
Thanks again for having us.

246
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,260
噢 小事一桩 你们想找我们聊些什么?
Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?

247
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
呃 你知道的 我们现在已经订婚了
Well, you know, now that we're engaged,

248
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,770
我们想问一下你们夫妻之间是如何解决财政问题的
we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.

249
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,100
我就说过他们叫我们来不是为了玩换妻游戏的
I told you they weren't gonna ask us to swing with them.

250
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,740
我可没觉得他们会这么想
I didn't think they were going to.

251
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,330
我只是想找个法子
I just wanted to have a way to say no

252
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,240
在不伤害Leonard幼小心灵的前提下拒绝他们
without hurting Leonard's feelings.

253
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,330
好吧... 一点没伤害啊
Well... nailed it.

254
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,830
所以你们想知道些什么
So what did you want to know?

255
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,790
呃 你们是否因为钱吵过架?
Well, do you guys ever fight over money?

256
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,340
当然 时不时的
Sure, sometimes.

257
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,510
我是说 鉴于我比Howie要多赚好多钱
I mean, it can be a little awkward

258
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,960
这着实有些尴尬
since I make so much more money than Howie.

259
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,210
你没必要强调 "多得多"
You didn't have to say "so much more."

260
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,760
是啊 我没必要 不过为了追求准确性
Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy

261
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,770
我还是觉得有必要
I felt that I should.

262
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,420
结婚的时候 我也带了
I brought a lot of significant assets

263
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,100
不少重要的财产呢
into the relationship, too.

264
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,970
比如? 不完整的星际迷航收藏?
Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?

265
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,390
告诉你 我刚在eBay上
For your information, I just bought the last one

266
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,750
把它补齐了
I needed on eBay.

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,450
未经我同意?
Without asking me?

268
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,500
拍卖只剩最后三分钟了
There were only three minutes left in the auction

269
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,740
而且那是一个不吸烟人士出手的几乎全新的Scotty手办
and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.

270
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,070
Howie 多少钱?
How much, Howie?

271
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,040
没多少的
Not a lot.

272
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,990
到底多少钱
How much?

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,210
我们别在朋友们面前说这事了吧
Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.

274
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,500
比猎鹰训练学校贵吗?
Was it more or less than falconry school?

275
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,840
我说了多少遍那是高朋网团购的
For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.

276
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,860
打死我都不和他换妻
Like I would swing with him.

277
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,350
你还好吗
How you feeling?

278
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,820
还行吧
Good.

279
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,690
稍微有点幽闭恐惧
Little claustrophobic.

280
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,070
我们把设备搭起来吧
Let's set up the equipment.

281
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,360
能帮助转移你的注意力
It'll help take your mind off of it.

282
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,450
矿工们经常唱一些小曲子来提升士气
Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.

283
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,110
你知道什么挖矿曲么?
Do you know any mining songs?

284
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,250
只知道热门的
Just the hits.

285
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,920
# 在地牢一般的黑暗中 #
# Where it's dark as a dungeon #

286
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,260
# 如露珠一般湿润 #
# And it's damp as the dew #

287
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,370
挺不错啊
That's pretty.

288
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,710
# 有着几倍的危险 #
# Where the dangers are double #

289
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,850
# 几乎没有快乐 #
# And the pleasures are few #

290
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,630
# 从来没有雨水 #
# Where the rain never falls #

291
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,300
# 也看不见阳光 #
# And the sun never shines #

292
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,220
# 是啊 和地牢一般的黑暗 # 
# Yes, it's dark as a dungeon #

293
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,220
# 在这深深的矿井之中 #
# Way down in the mine #

294
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,440
这歌好像比我想象的要阴暗一些
It's a little more bleak than I thought.

295
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,030
# 啊 我祈祷当我去世的时候 #
# Well, I pray when I dead #

296
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,810
# 随着时间的流逝 #
# And the ages shall roll #

297
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,480
# 我的身子越来越黑 #
# That my body will blacken #

298
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,900
# 然后化成煤矿 #
# And turn into coal #

299
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,320
越来越阴森了
Getting kind of grim.

300
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,790
# 然后我站在门口 #
# Then I'll look from the door #

301
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,910
# 在我天堂般的家园门口 #
# Of my heavenly home #

302
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,330
# 为那些矿工感到怜惜 #
# And pity the miner #

303
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,670
# 那些挖着我可怜的遗骨的矿工们 #
# That mines my poor bones. #

{\an8}(著名女歌手 曾主演汉娜蒙塔纳)

305
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,840
够了够了 接下来唱点麦莉的曲子吧?
Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?

306
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,370
他是什么人?
Who's he?

307
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,430
说到浪费钱 
Talk about wasted money.

308
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,770
那么最近是谁的信用卡没有及时还款
What about the late fees on our credit card

309
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,430
导致最近我们又被罚钱了?
because somebody didn't pay the bill on time?

310
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,850
哼 如果我不是在忙这忙那
Well, maybe I would have paid it

311
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,320
说不定就有空去交钱了
if I wasn't also doing everything else around here.

312
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,410
哦 你是说我无所事事吗?
Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here.

313
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,610
看我的家务表
Look at my chore chart.

314
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,170
- 她给他弄了个家务表  - 看到了
- She made him a chore chart.  - I see it.

315
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,670
"洗碗" 那栏有一颗星
"Do the dishes." There's a star right there.

316
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,620
看你可怜才给你的 把水弄到烤盘上
That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan

317
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,590
就那么留在水池里可不算洗了碗
and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.

318
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,760
烤盘得先浸泡一下 你又不是不知道
That pan had to soak and you know it.

319
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,880
好吧 要是没拿到零花钱
Well, don't come crying to me

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,430
别哭着来找我
when you don't get your allowance.

321
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,470
那不是零花钱
It's not an allowance.

322
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,800
那是薪水!
It's a stipend!

323
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,640
而且我们讨论过的 不要当着朋友们的面
And we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance

324
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,890
叫它零花钱
in front of my friends.

325
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,950
我通常不吃柠檬棒
I usually don't like lemon bars,

326
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,320
但这玩意儿真的很好吃
but th-these are really good.

327
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,490
于是 以汉娜蒙塔纳的身份 麦莉
So, as Hannah Montana, Miley

328
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,070
是一个风靡全球的明星
was a world-famous pop star.

329
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,070
但是之后她会像普通女孩一样
But then she would take off her wig and go to school

330
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,210
脱下假发去上学
like a normal girl.

331
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,380
要知道 她那个年纪
Which, I don't have to tell you,

332
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,330
就这一点就够头疼的了
at that age, is its own headache.

333
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,670
这不科学
That's preposterous.

334
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,750
她怎么做到带个假发就能不被认出来?
How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?

335
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,750
可你为什么觉得超人戴上眼镜
But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity

336
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,140
就能隐藏身份啊?
with a pair of glasses?

337
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,010
他又不是只戴一副眼镜
He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses.

338
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,680
他还把他的卷发往后梳了
He combs back his curlicue

339
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,850
并且言谈举止变得温文尔雅了
and affects a mild-mannered personality.

340
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,180
你们在下面还好吗?
You guys doing okay down there?

341
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
我不是叫你用对讲机的吗!
I told you to use the walkie-talkie!

342
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,690
你们在下面还好吗?
You guys doing okay down there?

Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.

344
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,950
我要去自动售货机那儿 有什么要带的吗
I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?

345
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,580
这是一次模拟测试 我们必须
This is a simulation. We have to survive

346
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,920
依靠我们带下来的供给生存下来
on the supplies we brought.

347
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,540
好吧 就是随口一问
Okay, just checking.

348
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,420
我们应该叫她弄点洋葱圈来
We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.

349
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,430
你不可能在地下一英里处的地方
You're not going to have Funyuns

350
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,760
搞到什么洋葱圈
when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth.

351
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,380
如果我们把它们带下来了呢?
What if we brought them down with us?

352
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,050
带一些洋葱圈来吧
We'll take some Funyuns.

353
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,020
还要别的吗?
Anything else?

354
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,720
再来点薄荷派
Some York Peppermint Patties,

355
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,390
{\an8}(德州人民最爱的饮料)

356
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,390
几罐"胡椒博士"...
a couple of Dr. Peppers, and...

357
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,190
你跑去百思买看看有没有卖便携DVD机
run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player

358
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,730
和汉娜蒙塔纳的第一季
and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.

359
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,200
让她买第二季
Have her get season two.

360
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,900
第一季还在铺垫剧情
Season one, it was still finding itself.

361
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,570
抱歉让你们见丑了
Sorry you guys had to see that.

362
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,910
没关系
Oh don't apologize. Yeah.

363
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,340
就只是我们比较难假装什么都没发生而已
It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.

364
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,460
一说到钱Howie就有点敏感
Money's a sensitive subject for Howie

365
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,330
我们收入差距有点大
because of the difference in our income.

366
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,630
他很不开心吗?
It really bothers him?

367
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,800
当然 即使现在还是有男人当家
Well, sure. There's still a lot of pressure

368
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,250
的舆论压力
on guys to be providers.

369
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,140
所以 虽然他为我感到高兴
So even though he's happy for me,

370
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,970
他自己还是挺难过的
it's just a little tough on him.

371
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,640
- 啊哦  - 怎么?
- Uh-oh.  - What?

372
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,890
呃
Well,

373
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,090
如果我销售做得好
if I do well in sales,

374
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,930
也许我以后赚的钱会比你多得多
I could end up making a lot more money than you.

375
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,930
没问题 从小
Not a problem. I grew up with a mother

376
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,580
我妈财产上气场上就碾压我爸
who emasculated my father financially

377
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,850
所以...
and in every other aspect of his life, so...

378
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,250
我觉得爱情就是那样的
really, it's what I think love looks like.

379
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,070
我一会回来 去看看他
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go check on him.

380
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,280
也许我们来了凡倒是好事
Maybe it's a good thing we came here.

381
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,450
- 至少知道我们不该做什么了  - 是啊
- It's like a lesson in what not to do.  - Yeah.

382
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,920
我不想因为钱什么的跟你吵架
I don't want something dumb like money to come between us.

383
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,120
不会的 我们一定会在婚前
It won't. Let's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out

384
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,290
把它处理好
before we get married.

385
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,670
你干嘛这么霸道?!
Why are you being so bossy?!

386
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,540
你干嘛这么孩子气?
Why are you being a baby?

387
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,080
我没有! 我是个大人了
I'm not a baby! I'm a grown man,

388
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,460
我铺好床了 奖给我的小星星呢?
and I made the bed. Now where's my star?

389
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,850
- 该走了?  - 等等
- Should we go?  - Hang on.

390
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,440
我想知道他能不能得到星星
I want to see if he gets the star.

391
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,890
这热度简直残忍
Oh, this heat is brutal.

392
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,360
作为一个从热带大陆的印度来的人
As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India,

393
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,900
你知道在潮湿环境中扇扇子
you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment

394
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,400
只会让你体温升高吧
only raises your body temperature.

395
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,320
哈 怪不得原来仆人们给我扇扇子的时候
Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot

396
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,150
他们看起来那么热呢
while they were fanning me.

397
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,870
先别想这有多不舒服了
Let's get our minds off how uncomfortable we are.

398
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,160
我们可以再读几个表
We could take some more simulated instrument readings.

399
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,500
目前我的重心
My major focus

400
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,210
在于控制我的密闭恐惧症
at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.

401
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,750
- 控制的怎么样?  - 你说呢
- How's that going?  - You tell me.

402
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,670
我觉得我快窒息了
I feel like I can't breathe,

403
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,300
已经在想把你撕成两半
and I am tempted to crack you open

404
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,140
从你的肺里吸出空气了
and suck the air right out of your lungs.

405
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,840
Sheldon 如果你受不了 我们就不继续了
Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.

406
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,010
不能停
We're not stopping.

407
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,730
你也不用把我头咬掉吧
You don't have to bite my head off.

408
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,350
对不起
I apologize.

409
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,730
我...
I j...

410
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,690
我内心满是挣扎
I'm plagued by an internal struggle.

411
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,350
如果你肯用那个桶子
If you would just use the bucket,

412
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,770
你肯定会舒服很多
you'd be so much more comfortable.

413
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,910
我是内心纠结
My struggle is emotional.

414
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,660
喔 是Amy吗?
Oh. Is it Amy?

415
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,830
是暗物质
It's dark matter.

416
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,080
我涉足弦理论的时候
When I entered the field

417
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,500
我当时是个神童
of string theory, I was a prodigy.

418
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,610
我慢慢升到令人尊敬的地位
I rose to a position of respect,

419
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,940
我还以为我的事业
and I assumed my career would continue

420
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,010
会一直这样稳步上升
on that upward trajectory.

421
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,850
结果现在我三十多了
Now here I am in my 30s,

422
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,850
一切又回到原点
I'm back at square one.

423
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,240
说实话 我很害怕
And, frankly, it's frightening.

424
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,860
Sheldon 你知道我害怕的时候都想什么吗?
Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared?

425
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,230
旅行者
Voyager.

426
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,610
你是说旅行者空间探测器
Voyager the space probe

427
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,160
还是那个星际迷航电视剧?
or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?

428
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,730
探测器
The space probe.

429
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,400
那就好 我现在太热了 没有精力
Good. Because I am too hot and tired

430
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
跟你说那电视剧有多烂
to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.

431
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,620
我出生那年
By the time I was born,

432
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,960
旅行者一号的任务就结束了
Voyager 1's mission was supposed to be over.

433
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
探测了
It had seen

434
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
木星与土星及其卫星与环
Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons,

435
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,420
但它没有停下脚步
but it kept going.

436
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,390
我离开印度来到美国
When I left India for America,

437
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,090
是我人生中最恐惧的时候
I was never more scared in my life.

438
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,490
未来的一切都是未知
I had no idea what lay ahead.

439
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,230
一旦我开始害怕 我就会开始想...
Whenever I feel that way, I think about how...

440
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,100
旅行者还在宇宙里
Voyager is still out there

441
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,770
在太阳系之外
somewhere beyond our solar system,

442
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,440
根本没人能想到他能走这么远
going further than anyone ever thought it could.

443
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,530
