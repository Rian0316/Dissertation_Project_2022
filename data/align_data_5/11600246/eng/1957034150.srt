1
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:03,802
You again?

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,199
You really wanna know
what happened last week

3
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:06,273
on Shameless?

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,912
The same old shit as last week.

5
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,647
When you work for a living,

6
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:10,899
the weeks just seem to blur together,

7
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,176
you know what I mean?

8
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:17,758
Don't judge me.

9
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,261
It's not like she wouldn't
be drinking by the third grade

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,594
growing up in this neighborhood.

11
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:22,922
Go.

12
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,718
Debbie needs her share of the utilities.

13
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,367
Want me to get some
shitty-ass minimum wage job

14
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,032
like you hauling boxes
around a warehouse?

15
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:30,023
Isn't marriage supposed
to be about communication,

16
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,568
compromise, agreed upon
mutual fuckin' goals?

17
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,379
How's that supposed to happen
when one person in the marriage

18
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,214
just goes off and does
whatever the hell he wants

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,198
without telling the other
person what he's doing?

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,992
Officer Tipping, I
believe I'm your partner.

21
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,493
Welcome to the Chicago police force.

22
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:42,870
Wait, you've never been shot?

23
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,038
Never been shot, never
shot at. You know why?

24
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,373
I don't leave the car.

25
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:48,041
I was bored shitless today.

26
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,544
I don't care 'cause I wanna be
the best partner that I can be.

27
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,729
So the least you can do
is buy me a damn drink.

28
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:53,939
One drink.

29
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:57,634
Really sorry again, sir,

30
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:58,736
that you had a heart attack.

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,721
You know, I somehow feel responsible.

32
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,223
We made $3,400.

33
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:05,559
It's been lovely doing
business with you.

34
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,019
Shall we do it again tomorrow?

35
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,062
I don't see why not. V?

36
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,899
Until our suppliers are
back up and running, sure.

37
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,234
"Wrongly convicted lesbian welder."

38
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,570
It's blowing up.
Everybody wants to hire you.

39
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:28,290

40
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:36,632
Just put on the dress, Franny!

41
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,678
No, no, no!

42
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:41,139
I need to take your picture
for Little Miss South Side.

43
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:43,583
Don't you want to be
Little Miss South Side?

44
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:44,727
No!

45
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:46,303
- Dress.
- Pants!

46
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:47,663
- Dress!
- Pants!

47
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,661
Can you at least brush your own teeth?

48
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:53,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

49
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,200
Your room is gonna be

50
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:04,233
swimming in constellations, little man.

51
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,522
Like Cassiopeia.

52
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,881
- Can you say...
- Cassiopeia.

53
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,502
Hey.

54
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:12,737
Hey.

55
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:13,967
How's baby?

56
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,592
I was up all night with
Cami and Brad at the ER.

57
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,498
Baby's lost a lot of weight.

58
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,061
They ran a bunch of tests,

59
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,947
but they still can't figure
out why he's not eating.

60
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,557
He's gonna be okay, though, right?

61
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,253
They're meeting with the
doctor in a couple hours

62
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:27,781
so I'm gonna shower, head
back, hold Cami's hand.

63
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,409
Brad was hoping you
could open up at BornFree.

64
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,746
- Yeah, sure. I'll take Fred.
- Cool.

65
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,415
Hey, you wanna hit
that switch right there?

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,318
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,915
Wow.

68
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,982
Yeah, right?

69
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:47,682
Oh, Milton's coming by later.

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,417
Thought he was on an
aircraft carrier somewhere.

71
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,628
- He's on leave. He's getting married.
- Mm.

72
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,105
Coming by to look for his dress shoes

73
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,630
in those boxes left in the garage.

74
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:00,706
Take it, you dirty convict.

75
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:01,855
Thought you weren't gonna fuck me

76
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,506
until I got a real job, huh?

77
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:04,549
Oh, I got my eyes closed,

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,259
pretending you're a Jonas Brother.

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,803
- Which one?
- Uh, Joe.

80
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:10,822
Fuck you. I'm totally Nick.

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,891
What the...

82
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,285
Call me Nick, you Jonas-loving slut.

83
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:17,895
Whoa, hey. The fuck you doing?

84
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,950
I'm gonna get you pregnant. Come on.

85
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,441
This isn't how we do it.

86
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,443
Well, it's not how we normally do it.

87
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,154
Been watching a lot of prison porn.

88
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:27,613
Kinda feel like making you my bitch.

89
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,099
I'm not your bitch.

90
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,992
Well, when I bottom, I power bottom,

91
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,161
so even then, you're totally my bitch.

92
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:33,599
And we're done.

93
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,831
Oh, come on. Where you goin'?

94
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:38,499
To whack off in the shower.

95
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,084
Oh...

96
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,311
All right, well, you know, I guess

97
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,341
I'll just drill the
fuck outta my hand too.

98
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,673
Maybe color it orange, call it Ian.

99
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,620
How was your first day as a cop?

100
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:51,971
Pfft, seen more action

101
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,032
playing Minecraft on the shitter.

102
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,160
- This stuff is delicious.
- You high?

103
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,686
As the Willis Tower.

104
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,062
Fringe benefit of being

105
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,773
the Alibi's chief
quality control officer

106
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,587
and weed sommelier.

107
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:07,820
Gotta fuel up for a big
day of pot purchases.

108
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,864
- Franny, breakfast!
- No!

109
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,325
I'm gonna kill her.

110
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,735
I'm gonna choke her with her
cargo pants until she's dead.

111
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,304
Still won't put on the dress?

112
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,206
Won't put on her dress,
won't brush her hair,

113
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,483
won't brush her teeth,
won't pack her own backpack.

114
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,510
Why can't Little Miss
Sunshine wear pants?

115
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,789
'Cause it's not Little
Mr. Sunshine, Carl.

116
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:27,094
Sounds like gender conformity.

117
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,051
It's not my world,
Liam. I just live in it.

118
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,737
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

119
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,721
Who you guys think is the
man in our relationship?

120
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:34,555
- You are.
- Ian.

121
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,890
Yeah, Neanderthal.

122
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,309
There's no man in our relationship.

123
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,228
But if there was, it'd be me.

124
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,538
Okay, well, who sticks it in who?

125
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:42,813
- I do.
- Irrelevant.

126
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:44,041
- And my dick's longer.
- Mine's wider,

127
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:45,900
which is the only metric that matters.

128
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,652
Look at him. He's too
pretty to be the man.

129
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,070
I'm pretty?

130
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,072
You have the hairless
body of a preteen girl.

131
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,424
Well, you like sticking
it up my shitter,

132
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:53,728
so what does that say about you?

133
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,970
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

134
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:59,038
Baby on board. Christ.

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,748
Uh, Pop Tart or banana?

136
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,792
Uh, Pop Tart. Whoa, Debs.

137
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,961
You're looking especially, um...

138
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,004
Boobularly abundant.

139
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,839
Hot Lesbian Convict Handywoman.

140
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:11,300
Customers love it. More
work than I can handle.

141
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,845
Franny, let's go!

142
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,347
I gotta go poop!

143
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,223
No, Franny. No!

144
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,766
Huh.

145
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,077
If I'm late to work, I'm
gonna lose this client.

146
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,328
If I'm gonna drop
you off before the doctor,

147
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,579
- we have to go.
- Hey, can you guys drop me off

148
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:24,164
at the precinct on your
way to the warehouse?

149
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,290
Would one of you guys
take Franny to school, please?

150
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:26,416
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Yeah.

151
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,955
- Sure, whatever.
- Thank you.

152
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,944
Carl, you get shotgun.

153
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,429
"Ianna" here can ride bitch.

154
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,698
Fuck that.

155
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,616
- Bye, buddy.
- Hey, wait up.

156
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:43,557
Mommy?

157
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,561
Come on, Franny.

158
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:50,932
Everyone left. I'll
take you to school again.

159
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:53,471
Everyone? What am I, chopped liver?

160
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,220
You're Frank.

161
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,231
You don't think I can get
my granddaughter to school?

162
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:02,184
You just said you're
high as the Willis Tower.

163
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,645
I've been high, drunk, or both

164
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,064
for every major moment
in all of your lives.

165
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,667
I think I can handle
something as minor...

166
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:09,692
Okay.

167
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,997
- Okay what?
- Okay, see you.

168
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:22,455
Why the hell did I do that?

169
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,501
Fuck.

170
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:30,773
Smile, girls.

171
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,343
There are my little Miss South Sides.

172
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,927
V, I ordered a few things.

173
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:37,928
Better not be any more toilet paper...

174
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

175
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,348
You gonna go kill Bill?

176
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:42,921
Oh you like the drip? It's cool, right?

177
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,835
I got something for the
girls for their photo shoot.

178
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,690
Ahh, yeah!-

179
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,484
- No!
- Yes.

180
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,361
Little Miss South Side is about finding

181
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,821
the perfect representative
for the neighborhood.

182
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,948
What South Side girl
can afford a fur coat?

183
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,950
A girl whose parents are
getting rich selling pot.

184
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:01,124
I got us something too.

185
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,318
Oh!

186
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:07,249
- Versace?
- Versocky.

187
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,126
S-O-C-K-Y. Knockoffs.

188
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,795
But we're making baller money now.

189
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,300
We should dress like ballers.

190
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,840
People have been looking
down on me my entire life

191
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:16,300
for being foster-kid poor.

192
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,387
I just wanna walk the streets
wearing my Versocky tracksuit

193
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:20,807
with my head held high

194
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,917
looking down on everyone else for once.

195
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,785
We need to be saving that money.

196
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,440
Return it. All of it.

197
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,206
How about I return the stuff that I got

198
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,874
for you and the girls
but I keep my new stuff

199
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,362
because... I'm a grown-ass man

200
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,806
and I can wear whatever I want?

201
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:42,287
Can I wear it today at least?
I'll return it tomorrow.

202
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:44,428
Fine.

203
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:47,248
But not the girls.
Give it back, and let's go to school.

204
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:48,749
- Why, Mom?
- Mom.

205
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,851
Because Mommy hates joy. That's why.

206
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:51,895
Let's go, girls.

207
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,504
Grab these masks, grab these bags.

208
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,089
We gotta go. Come, come, come.

209
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:06,358
Kev, what have you done to our truck?

210
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:08,162
Nothing.

211
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,686
Just new rims and a bangin' stereo.

212
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,858
Bang.

213
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,533
You see how I went down?

214
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,287
It kinda hurt, though.

215
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,596
After you weld the leak under the sink,

216
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,330
can you fix the toilet?

217
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:29,558
It's doing one of those things
where the water keeps running.

218
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,958
Sure.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,727
And also, the light bulb
in the fridge is out.

220
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,295
Can you change it?

221
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,672
You want to pay me to
change a light bulb?

222
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,276
Mm-hmm. Oh, and
the shower isn't draining.

223
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,777
Probably a hair clog. Sorry.

224
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,279
- Oh, a bunch of the doorknobs are loose.
- _

225
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,013
Can you go around and
tighten all of them?

226
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,322
- Shit.
- Oh, I have this squeaky...

227
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,266
You can just say no.

228
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:50,060
- Oh, no. I can do that.
- Oh, okay.

229
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:51,604
Also, there's some holes

230
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:53,745
in the wall in the master
bedroom that need patching up.

231
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,567
Oh, also, I have been
dying to mount the TV

232
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,152
in the living room, if you don't mind.

233
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,057
But the walls are thin, so
just... careful with the drill.

234
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:02,255
- Did you get all that?
- Yeah.

235
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:05,576
Great. All right, I gotta get to work.

236
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,637
Please wear your mask all day, please.

237
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:09,997
And when you're done,

238
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,266
you can just pull the
door closed behind you.

239
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,750
- It'll lock automatically.
- Great.

240
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,940
And, uh,

241
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,687
can I get a picture for Instagram?

242
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,507
My Ladies Who Lesbian group will flip.

243
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:20,807
Sure, yeah.

244
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,385
Do you have anything
sexy you can hold up?

245
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:30,135
Oh, my God, that is so
hot. All right, whoo!

246
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,020
Oh, wow.

247
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:35,731
All right, great.

248
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,149
Thank you. Have a great day.

249
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:38,885
Yeah, you too.

250
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,518
Come on, guys.

251
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,440
_

252
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:02,216
And that, Franny dear,
is how your mother

253
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,534
was conceived.

254
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:04,552
Okay, kiddo.

255
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:05,886
Thank you for your

256
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:08,055
intellectually challenging conversation.

257
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,623
Go get 'em in there.

258
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,875
And remember, always
throw the first punch.

259
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,110
This isn't my school.

260
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,397
Yeah, it is.

261
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:19,233
It's the school named
after the Black writer lady.

262
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:22,721
I go to Maya Angelou Elementary.

263
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,546
The poet, Maya...

264
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,792
I don't know where.

265
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,124
Uh, so it's boring, old prose for you.

266
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,956
Go on in.

267
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,645
Fuck.

268
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:44,651
Ah, what the hell.

269
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,300
Schools are all bullpucky anyway.

270
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:49,557
Let's get you some
real world experience.

271
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,974
Today is Take Your
Grandkid to the Work Day.

272
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,659
- You like that?
- Yeah.

273
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,352
I just made that up. Come on.

274
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:02,300
- Gallagher!
- Yes, sir.

275
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,695
How's Officer Tipping?

276
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,573
Life support. 60/40 chance of recovery.

277
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:08,854
Fuck.

278
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,952
Got you a new partner.
Try not to kill this one!

279
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,378
Sergeant James!

280
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:16,081
Yo, Billie!

281
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,751
Shit,

282
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:21,440
you really do look like Billie Eilish.

283
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,049
Huh. Well, what do you say, Billie?

284
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,618
Should we go get our dicks wet?

285
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:29,221
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-kay.

286
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,810
Open at last, open at last!

287
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,427
Thank the almighty mayor,
we are open at last.

288
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:46,036
Yo, drunks! Rise up.

289
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,942
Bars are officially open again?

290
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,549
Until there's another spike in cases.

291
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,950
I give it two weeks, tops.

292
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,466
All right, look. See?

293
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,706
My girls have Little Miss South Side

294
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,341
written all over their faces.

295
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,503
Well, that one, anyway.
She's something special.

296
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,897
Who, Gemma? Yeah, she is.

297
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:07,591
Kev, they are both special.

298
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,760
Gemma's just a little more special.

299
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,303
What's Little Miss South Side?

300
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:13,180
It's the South Side
Better Business Bureau's

301
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,849
annual contest to find a face
for all their advertising,

302
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,185
a face that shows hope and promise.

303
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:20,275
Makes you forget about
the looting and tear gas.

304
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,150
A face that makes you want to
spend money in the community.

305
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,943
I think Gayle King was
Little Miss South Side.

306
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:28,821
- And maybe Shelly Obama.
- Oh.

307
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,552
One case of expired brownie mix.

308
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,829
Take a Schlitz and my
payment, ple... hey.

309
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,615
Jesus Christ, Kev.

310
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,058
What is with the giant erection

311
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,583
and those fuckin' awful banana pants?

312
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,527
It's my money roll.

313
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,062
New thing I'm trying out.

314
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,089
Show people how rich I
am without saying anything

315
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:49,550
because V doesn't allow
me to announce it out loud.

316
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,218
She's the dom top in
your marriage, then.

317
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,771
Damn right.

318
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,055
You wanna thin out your money roll

319
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:56,390
for our brownie dealer, please?

320
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,891
And do not stretch those things out.

321
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,518
You're returning them tomorrow.

322
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,348
Hey, how much it cost

323
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,147
to use that shitty gym thing next door?

324
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,733
KevFit? $20 a session.

325
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:07,943
Lifetime membership for a Bitcoin.

326
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,803
Got a lot of takers on that, do you?

327
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,589
$10 a session for friends and family.

328
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,259
Well, there's ten boxes
in here at 2 bucks each

329
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:18,579
so... sign me up for two sessions.

330
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,997
Since when do you work out?

331
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,770
Since I married a body-shamer.

332
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,685
You know that Ian thinks he's
the man in the relationship

333
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,211
just 'cause he sticks it to me
and can do a few bicep curls?

334
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,839
I mean, clearly, I am the man.

335
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,091
But figure if I go pump
some iron, you know,

336
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,715
make it more clearly clear that...

337
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,622
More fucking clear.

338
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:39,933
Kev, where's the cash from
the pot sales last week?

339
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,703
It's not in the safe, and
the liquor guy's coming.

340
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,455
I didn't feel comfortable
leaving it in the safe

341
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,939
because it's the first
place robbers would look.

342
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:47,147
So...

343
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:53,201
it's like a piggy bank, but it's a keg.

344
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,155
It's a keggy bank.

345
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,387
You've been shoving our pot cash

346
00:14:58,412 --> 00:14:59,795
in a keg under the bar?

347
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:00,829
Of course not.

348
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,664
Net profits are in the keg,

349
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,349
the money for Frank to do pickups

350
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:05,584
is in the bench cushion,

351
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,936
and the cash to pay off the liquor guy

352
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,045
is in an envelope taped
under the pool table.

353
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:11,507
You can't be hiding our
cash all around the bar.

354
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:13,217
You can't just put it in a bank?

355
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,927
The banks are licensed by the feds,

356
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:18,276
but pot isn't legal nationally,
so banks won't take pot money.

357
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,157
I thought money was money.

358
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,964
They'll take it if
you just launder it first.

359
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,163
Just cash it in for chips
at the Indian Casino,

360
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:27,791
down a few free cocktails
for a couple hours,

361
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:28,816
then cash chips back out.

362
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,218
Clean money.

363
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:36,156
All right. Time to go get swole.

364
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,432
Swole?

365
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:40,577
Swole. Like swole.

366
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,330
Eh, fuck you, Kermit.

367
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,971
Hey, how long you two been married?

368
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,265
- About 14...
- 15.

369
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,768
- 15 years.
- Uh-huh.

370
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,644
Would you guys consider yourselves

371
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,704
equals in the relationship?

372
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,397
- Yeah.
- No way.

373
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:11,024
What the fuck, Doris?
I do shit around the house.

374
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,379
What, throw a dish
in the dishwasher once a week?

375
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:16,505
Yeah, I take out the trash. I fix stuff.

376
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,926
- So I can re-fix what you fix?
- Oh...

377
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,778
A man thinks if
he brings home a paycheck

378
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:23,203
and, I don't know, mows the
lawn every once in a while

379
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,138
that he can throw his
feet up in front of the TV

380
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,621
and call it a day.

381
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:29,376
Meanwhile, his wife does the
same shit at work for less pay

382
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,354
and still has to pick up after
her husband when she goes home.

383
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:32,880
- That's bullshit.
- Really?

384
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,339
Yeah.

385
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:35,567
I went to take care of my mom in Ohio

386
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,550
when she caught the virus.

387
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:37,788
Came back.

388
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,720
George hadn't done the
laundry for a month.

389
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:41,054
Tell him what happened.

390
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,807
I got a rash under my balls.

391
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,435
- From reusing his underwear.
- Reusing my underwear.

392
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:50,981
Women performed $1 1/2 trillion
in unpaid housework last year.

393
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,357
So the answer is no, Red.

394
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,318
Two people are never
equal in a relationship.

395
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,522
The woman always does more.

396
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,905
Honey, he's gay. They're both men.

397
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,326
Gender's a social
construct, but thank you.

398
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,161
No. One of you is the woman.

399
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,702
Who does more cooking or
cleaning, you or your husband?

400
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,332
Neither of us.

401
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:09,434
Who provides
more emotional support?

402
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,718
Don't know what that is.

403
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,395
- Kids to take care of?
- Nope.

404
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,421
Ah, see? There. Equals.

405
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,423
You both have jobs?

406
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,258
Uh, Mickey? Ish.

407
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,563
Who makes more money?

408
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,113
He does.

409
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,342
You do more work for less money?

410
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,100
I got news for you, honey.

411
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,358
You're the woman.

412
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,624
Atrial septal...

413
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:38,757
Atrial septal defect.
A hole in your baby's heart.

414
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,585
Is it life-threatening?

415
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,868
Under normal circumstances,
not immediately,

416
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,411
but there are risks.

417
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,622
- Like what?
- Heart failure.

418
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,874
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

419
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,588
Will it close on its
own as he gets older?

420
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,462
Unfortunately, no.

421
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,590
There's an opening on the
surgical schedule Tuesday.

422
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,509
Let's get you squared
away with a payment plan.

423
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,274
- Payment plan?
- For your copay.

424
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,094
How much we talking about?

425
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,324
- It doesn't matter, Brad.
- How much?

426
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:08,684
Your insurance company

427
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:11,001
will need to give you a proper estimate.

428
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,746
Ballpark it for us.

429
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:15,399
Well, assuming no complications,

430
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,626
your baseline copay
could be around $65,000.

431
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:20,737
Oh, my God, what?

432
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,649
Wait, they need to come up with $65,000

433
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,009
before Tuesday?

434
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,911
Well, with the payment plan...

435
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,930
So they can save their kid on layaway.

436
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,331
Mask up, Tami.

437
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:32,642
Well, how is she supposed
to see how pissed I am

438
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,667
if she can't see my face?

439
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,686
I mean, their baby is dying.

440
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,579
He's not dying yet.

441
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,315
If he were, the hospital
would have to treat him

442
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,300
regardless of your ability to pay.

443
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:43,962
So it's 65 grand?

444
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,346
Or you can wait until he's almost dead.

445
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:48,469
Stop, Tami.

446
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:53,353
Upbeat music playing

447
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:58,567
My most important function at the Alibi

448
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:02,107
is to procure the finest
product at the lowest price

449
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:05,427
so Aunt Kev and Uncle V can
sell it at a massive markup.

450
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,848
_

451
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,128
Side note... learn a
few words of Armenian.

452
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,298
They run the underworld, and
they appreciate the effort.

453
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,509
Now, the key to any negotiation

454
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:27,637
is to set your target
and to stick to it.

455
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:30,532
- What's your favorite number?
- Seven.

456
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,350
Oof. It's low.

457
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,728
But it'll be a good
test of your aptitude.

458
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,505
Now when I ask you a
question, you say, "Seven."

459
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:42,550
Don't sound angry, but speak firmly.

460
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:49,718
_

461
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:54,164
Mm. What do you want, Frank?

462
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,099
Ten ounces of your best, madam.

463
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,584
Mm-hmm.

464
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,591
And who is this?

465
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,161
This? This is my granddaughter.

466
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:11,556
She can tell you the exact
per-gram wholesale worth

467
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,934
of any type of marijuana available.

468
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,520
Total savant.

469
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,080
What is your name, girl?

470
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:22,169
Uh, idiot savant. Severe
learning disabilities.

471
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:25,237
Doesn't know anything it has
to do with pot evaluation.

472
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,286
She's like Rain Man, only a girl.

473
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,816
She's Rain Girl.

474
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,778
Oh, sweet Jesus.

475
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:40,502
- Is that...
- Peruvian Mother Sativa.

476
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:44,339
Well, Peru had a wet spring,
but if that's what you've got.

477
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,981
Franny, what do you think?

478
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,520
Seven.-

479
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,692
You're kidding me.

480
00:20:53,348 --> 00:20:56,583
Clients are paying 11 per gram.

481
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:58,294
Franny?

482
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:02,364
Seven.

483
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,444
Should we compromise? Maybe...

484
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:08,528
Seven, seven!

485
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,067
Looks like it's seven.

486
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,665
Or... we walk.

487
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:23,003
My philosophy
is no wrong is too small

488
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,671
for a cop to make right.

489
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:25,926
Like this motherfucker.

490
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,900
Arturro knows he's not
gonna make it across the road

491
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,218
before the light turns, but
he still begins his journey

492
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,114
after "don't walk" starts blinking.

493
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,365
Whole reasons he's in a
wheelchair to begin with

494
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,367
is because he started
crossing too late a decade ago.

495
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:38,833
Got hit by a streetsweeper.

496
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,401
Motherfucker never learns.

497
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,315
Yo, Arturro.

498
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:45,041
Let me help you, man.

499
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,528
Officers, I'm going as fast as I can.

500
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,049
Don't go faster, go sooner.

501
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,716
What? What?

502
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,889
All right, now you get your paraplegic

503
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,573
ass back to the side of the road

504
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,141
and you stay here

505
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,755
until the little, white
dude blinks at you.

506
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,128
What? This is...

507
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,723
I said stay, motherfucker. Just stay.

508
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:11,208
Yeah. Stay, motherfucker.

509
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,835
_

510
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,004
It's just snacks, guys.

511
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,392
Come on.

512
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,741
Oh, my God.

513
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,384
Fuck these guys.

514
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:43,750
Yes.

515
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,252
Hey, where have you been?

516
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:46,795
Sorry, I've been busy. What's up?

517
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,272
Do you have food at your house?

518
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,216
I need you to run some
snacks to Franny's school.

519
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:51,591
Well, I'm not home.

520
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,233
I mean, I guess I
could run to the store.

521
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,671
Never mind. It'll be too late.

522
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:57,931
I'll just borrow some food
from my client's house.

523
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:59,531
Pick me up on the way.

524
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:02,227
I can help you relax.

525
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:03,353
No, I can't.

526
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,355
I gotta run these snacks to school,

527
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:06,273
and then I gotta go to the store

528
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:08,108
and replace what I took,

529
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,418
and then I gotta get back
here and finish all this work.

530
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:10,902
Dude, okay. We could...

531
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:12,612
fingerbang on the way.

532
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:14,072
It'll help, I promise.

533
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:15,348
No.

534
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:17,092
Fine. Where are you?

535
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:18,076
Yeah?

536
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:19,338
Uh...

537
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:21,471
Parker and Sandusky.

538
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:22,765
What the hell are you doing over there?

539
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:45,208
Damn. It'll lock.

540
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:06,450
Fuck it.

546
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:22,015
Yo, what'd you do to your truck?

547
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,284
Oh, what you talking about, man?

548
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:25,525
The wheels, the boomin' bass?

549
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,620
Making a little money now.

550
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:28,603
Okay.

551
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,148
I would stay and hoop wit' y'all

552
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,525
but I gotta take this
cash to the Indian Casino

553
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,869
and launder it.

554
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:35,503
Take it to the bank.

555
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:36,988
Those gold spinners I got coming in

556
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,341
ain't gonna pay for themselves,
you know what I'm saying?

557
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,699
This man.-

558
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,285
All right, y'all. Mad respect.

559
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,496

That's what good, old
fashioned bootstrap-pulling

564
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:54,881
will do for ya.

565
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:56,518
Started with a bar and a dream.

566
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:59,969
Now I own the bar and
a dispensary and a gym

567
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:01,679
all under one roof.

568
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,099
You should stop in some time. The Alibi.

569
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,768
Give you a discount from you
being from the neighborhood.

570
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,775
Ugh. Dude, he got a boner.

571
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:12,982
No. Oh, that? No, that's my money roll.

572
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,860
Oh, cool, cool.

573
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,821
- Can we have it?
- Hmm?

574
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,861
Oh, no.

575
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,245
Five bucks even.

576
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:28,431
What is this shit?

577
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:29,600
Oh, you know. Just
some powdered donuts...

578
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,251
No, no, no. Fuck coffee and donuts.

579
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,603
No, you gotta treat
your body like a temple.

580
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:34,212
Look.

581
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,872
Red Bull for sustained energy,
turkey jerky for protein,

582
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:39,567
gingko biloba to stay mentally sharp.

583
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,886
Listen, you got a perp with
an axe coming towards you

584
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:43,371
at the end of a long day,

585
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:44,697
you don't wanna be fighting to remember

586
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:46,469
what side of your body
you keep your gun on.

587
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,349
Now let's go. You can have some of mine.

588
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:50,860
Wait, uh...

589
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,993
What are you doing, Gallagher? Let's go!

590
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,862
We don't pay for shit.

591
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:00,655
What are they gonna
do, call the cops on us?

592
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:01,906
We have a 1080

593
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,300
on the north side of Lincoln Park.

594
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:04,760
All available officers on the scene.

595
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,244
1080. What is that, a car chase?

596
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:08,371
Yup. Let's go.

597
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,832
Hey, hey. Why you riding shotgun?

598
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:12,350
What? You want me to drive?

599
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,293
Well, you ain't gonna learn nothing

600
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,627
from the passenger seat.

601
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:15,962
Fuck yeah.

602
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,607
Seven.

603
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,396
- Franny?
- Seven!

604
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,934
No wonder Ian's always
in such a bad mood.

605
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,836
Forgot how much working
out fuckin' blows.

606
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:58,966
V, got any protein shakes?

607
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,467
I'm just kidding. Give me a Guinness.

608
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,470
Give me the bat! Give me the bat.

609
00:27:05,512 --> 00:27:06,721
Give me the bat, V.

610
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:08,306
Holy... Kev, what happened?

611
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:09,624
I got robbed, V.

612
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,201
They took my bling, my money roll.

613
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:12,810
- Your pants.
- Dignity.

614
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:14,896
They got the JL 12-inch TW1 speakers

615
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,064
I installed in the truck.

616
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:18,782
- How did they get those?
- They took the truck.

617
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,820
Please tell me this is
after you laundered our money

618
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:24,322
and made the bank deposit.

619
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:25,532
I could tell you that...

620
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,896
- but I'd be lying.
- Kev.

621
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:35,542
Oh, hey, buddy. Oh!

622
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,977
Why don't we, uh, stick to the binky

623
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:39,546
instead of, you know, rusty metal, huh?

624
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:41,712
There you go.

625
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:47,804
Hey, it's your mama. Hey.

626
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,198
How soon can you sell that bike?

627
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:51,349
Huh?

628
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:54,769
- The Indian in the garage. How soon?
- Well, it's not done.

629
00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:56,205
I know, but how much 
could you get for it,

630
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:57,647
like, right now?

631
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,793
Slow down. What's going on?

632
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,502
He's got a hole in his heart.

633
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:04,404
The baby?

634
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:06,660
No, Brad. Yes, the baby.

635
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,408
They're gonna operate on Tuesday

636
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:10,243
if Brad and Cami can prove

637
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,567
they can cover the

638
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,379
- $65,000 copay before then.
- What?

639
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:16,267
Dad is trying to pull
together some cash,

640
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,793
but his business is in the crapper
since the COVID shutdown,

641
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,462
and I've got a few
thousand in savings, but...

642
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:22,480
Yeah, no, I mean I can
put the Indian on eBay,

643
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:24,257
but it probably
wouldn't sell by Tuesday.

644
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,026
Do you think Debbie
would sell her truck?

645
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,136
No, considering that's
how she makes a living.

646
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,138
What about the rest of the Gallaghers?
What do they got?

647
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,115
Uh, 50 bucks in the squirrel fund

648
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,017
and a cupboard of expired cereal.

649
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:35,119
Are you telling me the Gallaghers

650
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,644
can't do anything here?

651
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,730
Okay, Aunt Oopie is
gonna pawn some jewelry.

652
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,690
Uh, Cory's donating the money she made

653
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:42,308
posing nude at that art school.

654
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,460
Everyone is making sacrifices.

655
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,463
Yeah, well, the Tamiettis
have things they can sacrifice,

656
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:49,133
all right? Liam and Carl
still share underwear.

657
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:51,737
Look, um, I'm in this
with you, all right?

658
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:52,802
100%.

659
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:55,079
We'll help Brad and Cami figure it out.

660
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:56,878
Okay.

661
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,637
It's just...

662
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:01,544
yeah, I don't know
what they're gonna do,

663
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,980
so...

664
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,257
Um, I gotta get back upstairs,

665
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,939
but I'll check in with
you in a bit, okay?

666
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,844
All right. I'll
talk to you soon. Bye.

667
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:10,928
Bye.

668
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:28,463
My wrist is cramping.

669
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:30,906
I'm sorry. I'm just too stressed.

670
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:35,495
So what if she wouldn't
put on the damn dress?

671
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,523
I need to get a photo for
Little Miss South Side.

672
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,055
Girls wear pants, Debbie.

673
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,417
Whatever. Let's just drop it.

674
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,492
She's coming.

675
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,771
- Hi, Debbie.
- Hey.

676
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:47,131
Sorry I'm not 500 feet away, but...

677
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:49,842
That's okay. I won't tell if
you won't.

678
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:52,178
Uh, so I brought flax seed crackers,

679
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,846
organic split pea hummus,

680
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:56,216
and green juice pressed from vegetables.

681
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,659
You're kidding.

682
00:29:57,684 --> 00:30:00,144
- I'm sure they'll... love it.
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:01,497
So good of you to stick to snack duty

684
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:03,189
with Franny not at school today.

685
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:04,453
Thanks again.

686
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,539
Wait, what? Franny's not at school?

687
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:08,945
What the fuck?

688
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,641
Okay, stick your nose in
that. Tell me what it needs.

689
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:20,250
That is exactly what I would've chosen.

690
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:25,378
We're gonna call this recipe
Little Half-Mexican Red

691
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,813
in your honor.

692
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:29,149
Here.

693
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,235
Stick your pinky in there
and pack it in nice and tight.

694
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,844
There you go. That's really good.

695
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,227
This reminds me of the time

696
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,063
your mother helped Grammy Monica and me

697
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:47,891
measure out some premium Columbian blow.

698
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:52,703
One of my favorite
memories of your mother.

699
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,953
You know, that might've
been your Aunt Fiona.

700
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,184
Hmm.

701
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,669
Okay.

702
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:08,087
Back when I was in college,

703
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,715
I would be embarrassed
to roll a joint like that.

704
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,258
Today, I'll take it.

705
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,596
_

706
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,373
- Not in there?
- No.

707
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,075
Did you ask them who
took Franny to school?

708
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:22,034
- Yeah, I just did.
- Well, what are they saying?

709
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,438
"Don't know," "Not sure,"
"Fuck if I know," "Don't know."

710
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,344
Well, who was supposed to know?

711
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:30,443
"Don't know," "Not
me," "Fuck if I know,"

712
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:31,444
- "Frank."
- Frank?

713
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,779
They left her with Frank?

714
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,078
Where is he now?

715
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:36,588
"Bar," "dumpster,"

716
00:31:36,824 --> 00:31:38,260
"Hooker's vag," "Leave
me alone, Debbie."

717
00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:39,619
- Huh.
- It's lunchtime,

718
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,788
so Frank's probably tanked
at the Alibi already.

719
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:43,623
I'm gonna fucking kill 'em all.

720
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,302
- This blows.
- I told you.

721
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:59,336
You take 41, you get pinned
to the lake with traffic.

722
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:02,600
Think I'ma get in trouble for
busting out that headlight?

723
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,912
Nah. German Shepherd
should've looked both ways

724
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,270
before crossing the street.

725
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:07,772
Check this out.

726
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:08,924
What you see?

727
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:11,835
Old lady screaming into her phone,

728
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,277
couple lookie-loos.

729
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,797
Okay, now that lookie-loo right there.

730
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:15,822
Tell me about him.

731
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:17,680
White guy. Mid-20s.

732
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,570
Looks like he wants to be Macklemore.

733
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:21,327
We should talk to him.

734
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,287
Lone white kid in the vicinity

735
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,469
where a Black man's getting arrested?

736
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:28,023
90% chance Black guy's his drug dealer.

737
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:31,187
- Ain't that racial profiling?
- Black is as Black does.

738
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:34,340
- But you're Black.
- Bitch, I'm blue.

739
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,438
Yo, can we talk?

740
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,721
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, where you going?

741
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,473
None of your business, Lady Po-Po.

742
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:44,350
Oh. Gun, Billie.

743
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,960
Yes, Leesie... Kaleesie.

744
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:48,187
Bitch, this makes
everything my business.

745
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:49,647
Hands in the air, motherfucker.

746
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,664
Yeah. Hands in the air, motherfucker.

747
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,403
- Shoot him.
- Wait, really?

748
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:56,696
No... girl, no! Go get him.

749
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:58,030
Oh, right.

750
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,043
Got you now, motherfucker!

751
00:33:13,504 --> 00:33:15,214
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

752
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:16,173
Where you think you're
going, Macklemore?

753
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:18,050
Oh, shit.

754
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:19,528
Oh, wait. No,
no. Come on, come on!

755
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,535
- Wait, no... stop, stop...
- Get up.

756
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,232
Hey. Cuff him, Gallagher.

757
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:34,901
Congratulations.

758
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:37,920
- You just popped your cherry.
- Fucking bitch.

759
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:49,415
What is that?

760
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:52,293
It's my kid brother.
He got his first arrest.

761
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:54,103
- Aww, yeah.
- Oh, big shot.

762
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:55,663
Yeah.

763
00:33:57,632 --> 00:33:59,750
It's noon-thirty, boys and Doris.

764
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:01,769
Everyone take their lunch break.

765
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,179
Hey, Red.

766
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:08,984
Finish filling that order before you go.

767
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,897
You want me to work
through my lunch break?

768
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,189
Yes.

769
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,316
- You gonna pay me extra?
- No.

770
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:17,919
Then no.

771
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:19,278
You're behind.

772
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,140
You're not gonna finish
by the end of the day.

773
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,523
Okay, so I'll stay late.

774
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:25,409
I could use the overtime.

775
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:26,769
We don't pay overtime.

776
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,080
You working too slow isn't my problem.

777
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:31,123
You gave me a bigger
order than everybody else.

778
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:33,781
Everyone takes their turn
with the bigger orders.

779
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,047
Hike up your skirt and be a team player.

780
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:38,922
Yeah, how about no?

781
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:42,151
How about don't be a little bitch

782
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:43,636
and you get to keep your job?

783
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,315
I'm not anybody's bitch.

784
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,551
Think we should quit the pot business?

785
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,495
But we're making real money, V.

786
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,980
Doesn't matter if you're dead.

787
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,428
Dealing shouldn't be
dangerous now that it's legal.

788
00:35:13,453 --> 00:35:14,850
Dealing isn't dangerous.

789
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,478
Being rich on the
South Side is dangerous.

790
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:17,795
We are not rich.

791
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:19,758
You saying that out loud is dangerous.

792
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:22,898
We need to arm ourselves.

793
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:25,553
- Guns.
- No guns.

794
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,864
Throwing stars, then.
Where are my throwing stars?

795
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,142
Okay, dumbasses, stop, stop, stop.

796
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,627
Look. First off...

797
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,487
Actually, first off,
Kev, put some pants on.

798
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:35,972
You're turning me on a little bit.

799
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:38,941
Second, you need to get rid
of these clothes, all right?

800
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,544
No more bling, no more
tricked-out trucks.

801
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:42,520
You need to go way under the radar here.

802
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:44,714
And finally, you two need
to pay someone security

803
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,032
for your daily cash runs.

804
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:47,217
I would say do it yourselves,

805
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,802
but clearly that's a
bit of a non-starter,

806
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:51,195
so pay me 25% of your gross profits,

807
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,221
I'll do it for you.

808
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,664
Security and armed transport

809
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:56,351
from the bar to the casino to the bank.

810
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:00,893
- I think we should do it.
- 25%?

811
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,026
Between him and Frank,
that's half of our profits.

812
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,468
15%.

813
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:07,268
23 and free KevFit membership.

814
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,680
Done.

815
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:12,475
Frank Gallagher!

816
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,143
- Jesus.
- Whoa.

817
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,619
He's not here. What happened?

818
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,563
My dumbass family left Franny with Frank

819
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:18,749
and he never took her to school.

820
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:20,316
Does anybody know where he is?

821
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:22,128
He's supposed to be
doing pot runs for us.

822
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,111
He took her to buy drugs?

823
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,112
- Where?
- I don't know.

824
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:26,322
He said something about

825
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:28,657
an Armenian dry cleaner in Chatham.

826
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:30,576
And his dealer friends by the park.

827
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:34,747
Hey! Eat shit, Ian!

828
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,284
What the fuck, Debbie?

829
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,435
Kev, can I get a shot of whiskey?

830
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:49,220
What are you doing here?

831
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,764
- Getting' man-swole.
- Oh, great.

832
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:53,450
Maybe when I fuck you, I won't
feel like such a pedophile.

833
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:54,683
Suck a dick, bitch.

834
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:55,869
Shouldn't you be taking it up the vag

835
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:57,357
at your shitty warehouse job?

836
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,224
Fuck 'em.

837
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:00,874
Tried to make me work for
free through my lunch break,

838
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:02,084
so I quit.

839
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:04,043
Really?

840
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,670
Oh, well, don't you worry
your pretty little head

841
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:06,904
about it, there, babyface.

842
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,256
'Cause between the expired food sales

843
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,407
and the new business
deal that I just got,

844
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:11,884
I got us covered.

845
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,011
Maybe you can be one of those

846
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:14,912
kept wife things they had in the '50s.

847
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:16,982
Nice, frilly aprons
and high heels and a...

848
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:18,474
bouffant.

849
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,667
"Buff-int"?

850
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,293
Okay, fuck it. I'm going home.

851
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:23,963
No, it's a good idea. Why
don't you kick back, relax?

852
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:25,189
Maybe watch some soaps
while you think about

853
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:26,757
what to cook me for dinner.

854
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:31,762
- You little bitch!
- You're the bitch!

855
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:35,641
Whoa. You gonna stop this?

856
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:37,115
I wanna see who wins.

857
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:40,771
Shit.

858
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:46,443
Uh-uh.

859
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,320
Hey! Hey!

860
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:51,521
No, sir!

861
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:55,146
No, sir. Not in Mama's house.

862
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:05,834
Hey. What are you doing here?

863
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:08,365
Eating my feelings.

864
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,920
Fuck it. I need a smoke.

865
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,165
Yeah, good idea.

866
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:17,764
We can probably afford lung surgery.

867
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,771
Yeah, okay.

868
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:27,902
You know, I, uh,
talked to everybody here

869
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,695
about pulling some money together,

870
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:31,906
but, uh, everybody's
still pretty underwater

871
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,683
from the recession and all.

872
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:38,053
Do you remember those
assholes in Tennessee

873
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,789
who bought up 18,000
bottles of hand sanitizer,

874
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,357
sold 'em for, like, 70 bucks a pop?

875
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,037
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- What if we bought up

876
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:48,964
all of something like... like,
uh, all of the condoms in Chicago?

877
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,735
No, we'd just end up with
more pregnant 13-year-olds.

878
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,845
Hey, we could stab the baby.

879
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:56,889
That'll open that hole right up.

880
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,435
Then they'd have to operate.

881
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:09,083
Could've been Fred.

882
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:18,994
One of the most important
things a human can learn

883
00:39:19,036 --> 00:39:22,310
is how to take advantage
of a vulnerable population.

884
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:25,709
Who are the most vulnerable
people in the world?

885
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:27,811
Puppies?

886
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:28,796
Close.

887
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:30,172
Millennials.

888
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:32,233
Vulnerable to their own inflated senses

889
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,786
of their self-worth.

890
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,762
Now, the vast percentage of our market

891
00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:38,264
is made up of millennials

892
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:39,282
and every single one of

893
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,976
- 'em thinks that he or she...
- Or "they."

894
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:44,311
Or they is special.

895
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:47,849
So a plain old joint
isn't enough anymore.

896
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:50,943
We need a variety of
fancy rolling papers

897
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,946
so that each millennial
can choose one that says,

898
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,482
"This is me."

899
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,284
Will the dye in the
papers destroy their lungs?

900
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:00,369
- Yes.
- Do they care?

901
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:01,954
- No.
- Not at all.

902
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:05,207
Because in the moment, they
can say to their friends,

903
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,474
"I got something you don't got,"

904
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:11,213
and at the end of the day,
we all want that, I suppose.

905
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:13,575
So that's everything on our list.

906
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:15,739
Let's head home.

907
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,358
Vernon and Jackson.

908
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:25,511
Uh, where are we? What...

909
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:28,497
Why are we here?

910
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:29,846
Paper store?

911
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,321
Rolling papers, right.

912
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:36,822
Let's head to the paper store.

913
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,230
Grampy Frank.

914
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:50,781
I think...

915
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,015
I got a little, um...

916
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:57,843
well, I suppose we're done.

917
00:40:57,994 --> 00:40:58,953
Hey.

918
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:03,349
You wanna make one more
stop before we head home

919
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:05,144
to commemorate this day?

920
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:07,161
Come on.

921
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:16,463
Ow.

922
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:17,696
My bad.

923
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,385
Nah, leave it, leave
it, leave it, leave it.

924
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,877
How do you know the perp in
that car chase back there?

925
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,087
I don't.

926
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,549
Fuck!

927
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:42,388
How do you know the
perp in that car chase?

928
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:45,891
Oh, come on, bitch. I ain't
answering shit without my lawyer...

929
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:46,892
Fuck!

930
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,060
How do you know...

931
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:49,228
Please! I don't, okay?

932
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,231
Fuck!

933
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:53,357
Fuck.

934
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,234
He's my dealer, okay?

935
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,512
Are you willing to
testify to that in court?

936
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,879
Please. Come on.

937
00:41:58,904 --> 00:42:00,406
You know his people will kill me.

938
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,244
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
kay, kay, kay, fine, fine.

939
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:06,797
I'll testify.

940
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:14,837
Frank Gallagher!

941
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,106
No! What you...

942
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:19,925
He is not here. What do you...

943
00:42:34,148 --> 00:42:36,442
Debbie, this park is
huge. Where do we start?

944
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:43,282
Over here? Maybe over there.

945
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:50,300
Frank Gallagher!

946
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,169
Frank Gallagher!

947
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:01,925
What's going on with you two?

948
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:02,986
He's been sitting on his ass

949
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,470
spending all our wedding money...

950
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:05,905
This lady just decides we're
not sharing our money...

951
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:07,323
And all of a sudden, he's
making bank doing all sorts...

952
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:08,265
And as soon as I start making
more than him, he turns...

953
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:10,011
- He's a fucking top now.
- Stop!

954
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,312
First of all, you need
to clean up your language.

955
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:16,815
Bitch this and vagina that is
incredibly offensive to women.

956
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:18,793
And just because you're gay
doesn't mean you get away

957
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:21,153
with turning women into
second-class citizens.

958
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:24,573
Second of all, there are no
men or women in a marriage,

959
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:25,824
there are only partners,

960
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:27,451
and I'd be very careful

961
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:29,928
about claiming the title of head partner

962
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:31,673
'cause you have no clue
what's gonna happen.

963
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:32,998
And you're fucking yourselves

964
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,566
if you think keeping
score is a good idea.

965
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,336
Finally, I don't care who's
the top and who's the bottom.

966
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:38,587
You fight in my bar again,

967
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:39,814
I'm cutting both of your dicks off.

968
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:41,816
Then ain't no one topping anyone.

969
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:47,949
Now, here. Eat some pot brownies.

970
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,027
Y'all need to chill the fuck out.

971
00:43:58,777 --> 00:44:00,000
Bitch.

972
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,722
- Yo.
- Hey, thanks.

973
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:18,560
How you holdin' up?

974
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:19,962
As well as can be expected

975
00:44:19,987 --> 00:44:22,907
for a parent that can't
afford to save his kid.

976
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:27,195
Tami and I, we're gonna figure out a way

977
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:29,012
to help you pay for the surgery.

978
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:30,293
Yeah?

979
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:32,386
You kiddin'?

980
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:35,112
You got your own kid to take care of.

981
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,354
Nah, this one's on me.

982
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:39,463
- I appreciate it, though.
- Yeah.

983
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,550
You got a plan?

984
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,492
Think I'm gonna let him die.

985
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,913
I told Tami that, uh, we should stab him

986
00:44:54,955 --> 00:44:57,879
so they have to operate.

987
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,730
Nah, I'm gonna sign
up for a payment plan.

988
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:07,806
Sell BornFree.

989
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,635
No, man. I mean, you can't do that.

990
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,239
I don't think there's any other way.

991
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,824
You poured everything
you have into that place.

992
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:21,104
It saved you.

993
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,293
I got a wife and two kids.

994
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:28,730
They're my BornFree now.

995
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,347
I gotta choose between
my business and them,

996
00:45:33,783 --> 00:45:36,702
it's them in a heartbeat.

997
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:54,640
Have fun today, Billie?

998
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:56,475
Beats whacking off to "Training Day."

999
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,037
Uh, hey. Was waffling
an admission of guilt

1000
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:00,538
out of that guy without a lawyer present

1001
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:02,648
legal, ethical, or whatever?

1002
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:05,108
You're cute.

1003
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,236
Listen, our job isn't law
or ethics; it's justice.

1004
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:09,297
That guy was running away from the cops,

1005
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:10,447
and he admitted guilt.

1006
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:11,782
End of story.

1007
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:13,950
And the second you start
thinking 'bout legal

1008
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:15,553
and ethical is the second a
bad guy shoots you in the face.

1009
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:16,679
You wanna get shot in the face?

1010
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:18,205
No, I wanna shoot people in the face.

1011
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,182
Ooh, that's the spirit.

1012
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:22,289
Just make sure they shoot first.

1013
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:25,754
Congratulations on a good day, Billie.

1014
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,690
We'll get that blood
running icy blue in you yet.

1015
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:46,775
Maybe one day I'll get one

1016
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,894
for your baby cousin, Fred, too.

1017
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:51,191
I don't know if I like him yet.

1018
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:53,800
But you're pretty swell,

1019
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,536
so you've earned a
place on my arm forever.

1020
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:02,230
I've wanted to ask you since breakfast,

1021
00:47:02,874 --> 00:47:06,211
but we didn't have the
same relationship then

1022
00:47:06,253 --> 00:47:07,629
that we do now.

1023
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,632
Why were you giving
your mom such a hard time

1024
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:13,952
to put on that dress and
get your picture taken?

1025
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:17,406
I know it was a butt-ugly dress,

1026
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:20,992
and I get the sense you're less
a girly-girl and more of a...

1027
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:22,339
A boy.

1028
00:47:23,895 --> 00:47:25,238
Sure.

1029
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:28,024
Live your truth.

1030
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,693
But you know, sometimes

1031
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:31,996
it's nice to make other people happy.

1032
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,240
My father used to get drunk
and make me put on a dress

1033
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:37,075
when I was your age,

1034
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,202
and I hated it,

1035
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:43,454
but I did it because my father liked it.

1036
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,277
It's called playing the long game.

1037
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:53,717
Someday, you'll get
caught doing an eight-ball

1038
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:57,262
or sleeping with a
not-too-distant cousin,

1039
00:47:57,287 --> 00:48:00,348
and you'll get off
with a slap on the wrist

1040
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,476
'cause your mom will remember

1041
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:05,103
that you put on a dress for her once.

1042
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:07,689
- That's beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1043
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:15,511
I had a really nice
day with you today, kid.

1044
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:20,744
A really nice day.

1045
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,058
If anything happens to Franny,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill them.

1046
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:30,896
Who was supposed to
take Franny to school?

1047
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,738
I don't know. Any of them?

1048
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:36,218
So you left for work without making sure

1049
00:48:36,243 --> 00:48:38,496
an actual person took
your kid to school?

1050
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:39,821
What? Do you think this is my fault?

1051
00:48:42,015 --> 00:48:43,230
Fuck!

1052
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:44,826
Hi, Liz!

1053
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,897
Debbie, the police are here.

1054
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:50,315
Wait. Why?

1055
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:51,817
Apparently, a neighbor saw you

1056
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:53,669
crawling out of the window
with an armload of stuff

1057
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:55,320
- so she called the police.
- Shit.

1058
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:58,965
And I checked my security
camera, and it showed you

1059
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,718
stealing food out of my pantry
and crawling out my window.

1060
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:03,286
I'm so sorry! I...
I... but I can explain.

1061
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:04,621
Did you steal anything else?

1062
00:49:04,663 --> 00:49:06,373
No, I didn't steal anything.

1063
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:08,959
I... listen. I'll come back tomorrow

1064
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,895
and I'll replace everything
that I borrowed, okay?

1065
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,954
I'm not gonna press
charges because, clearly,

1066
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:15,273
you are so white trash
that you need to take food

1067
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:16,776
- for your family.
- I am not white trash!

1068
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,279
But you are never coming
near my house again.

1069
00:49:19,678 --> 00:49:22,514
P.S., I'm leaving you a
really shitty review on Yelp.

1070
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:26,544
Fuck!

1071
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:34,693
Wait. Is that them?

1072
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:41,700
You're nuts.

1073
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:44,244
Oh, my God. Franny!

1074
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:45,871
Franny, are you okay?

1075
00:49:45,912 --> 00:49:48,373
Where have you been? I
was so worried about you.

1076
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:51,835
Why? She was with me all
day. We had a great time.

1077
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:53,685
Look, we got tattoos.

1078
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:57,048
What the hell is wrong with you?

1079
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,342
You were supposed to
take Franny to school!

1080
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:01,653
I actually did take her to school.

1081
00:50:01,678 --> 00:50:03,054
It just happened to be one

1082
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:05,138
named after the wrong Black lady.

1083
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,225
They all look the same!

1084
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:08,727
- What?
- Wow.

1085
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:11,146
Not Black ladies! Schools!

1086
00:50:11,204 --> 00:50:13,248
She missed a day of preschool.

1087
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:14,858
It's not like she missed

1088
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,694
What To Do If There's A
Hole In Your Spacesuit Day

1089
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,238
at astronaut camp. What's the big deal?

1090
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,073
The big deal is that I didn't know

1091
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,291
where my kid was for six hours.

1092
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:26,053
I know you didn't give a
shit where your kids were

1093
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:28,076
most of our lives,
but I care about mine!

1094
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:40,258
What happened to you?

1095
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,885
I got married. That's what happened.

1096
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:44,095
Well, I'd divorce you, but
you never signed a prenup.

1097
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:51,453
- What happened to you guys?
- They got married.

1098
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:53,939
Guess what. I just made my first arrest.

1099
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,374
- Awesome.
- Way to go.

1100
00:50:55,398 --> 00:50:56,626
- All right, buddy.
- Fuck you, cop.

1101
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,277
Hey, assholes. Who
left my kid with Frank?

1102
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:00,779
- I didn't.
- Wasn't me.

1103
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,076
Nope.

1104
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:04,310
I did.

1105
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:05,593
What the hell is wrong with you, Liam?

1106
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:07,452
Hey. Ease up.

1107
00:51:07,494 --> 00:51:10,080
So Frank left her at
school. What's the big deal?

1108
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:11,623
He didn't drop her off at school.

1109
00:51:11,665 --> 00:51:13,124
He took her to buy drugs!

1110
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,365
All right, well, that's 
not Liam's fault.

1111
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:16,896
Why'd you leave her with Liam anyway?

1112
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,046
Didn't leave her with Liam.

1113
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:19,315
I left her with all of you guys.

1114
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:20,423
No, you didn't.

1115
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:21,800
I stood right there

1116
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:23,235
and asked one of you
to take her to school

1117
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:24,636
'cause I was running late for work.

1118
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:25,971
I didn't hear you say that.

1119
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:26,972
- Me, neither.
- Me, neither.

1120
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:28,540
I mean, did anybody say, "Yes, Debbie,

1121
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:29,824
I will take Franny to school"?

1122
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:31,142
Great, take her side.

1123
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:32,536
I'm not taking anybody's side.

1124
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,330
I'm just saying take some
fuckin' responsibility.

1125
00:51:34,354 --> 00:51:36,856
I'm taking all of the responsibility.

1126
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:39,776
I am running this entire
house, I'm holding down a job,

1127
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:40,652
and I have to take
care of a kid in my...

1128
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:42,153
Jesus Christ!

1129
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:43,547
You're not the only one
with shit going on, Debs.

1130
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:45,657
If you can't handle
it, lean the fuck out.

1131
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,617
Don't blame us for being a shitty mom.

1132
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,852
Debs.

1133
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:00,267
I didn't mean that.

1134
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:27,824
Ah, fuck.

1135
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:29,034
That is good.

1136
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:30,660
- Oh, you like that?
- Mm!

1137
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:32,162
That's a little Half-Mexican Red.

1138
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:33,788
Named after Franny.

1139
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,796
Indica-forward, mellow and agreeable

1140
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:40,045
with just enough sativa to give
it a little kick of rebellion.

1141
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:41,379
Just like Franny.

1142
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:43,548
Sounds
like your granddaughter

1143
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,258
left quite an impression on you.

1144
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,587
What do you mean?

1145
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:49,763
Well, you never named anything
after any of your actual kids.

1146
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:51,389
That's because they don't make pot

1147
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:53,516
that's belligerent and ungrateful.

1148
00:52:53,558 --> 00:52:55,852
If your kids are
belligerent and ungrateful,

1149
00:52:55,894 --> 00:52:57,502
it's probably 'cause
you made 'em that way.

1150
00:52:57,527 --> 00:52:58,695
I...

1151
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:04,547
Kids are tough.

1152
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:06,488
They need things.

1153
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:08,531
Grandkids are simpler.

1154
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:09,741
You don't owe 'em anything.

1155
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:12,243
They don't expect anything from you.

1156
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:13,993
Pressure's off.

1157
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,615
You can't disappoint anyone.

1158
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:22,087
You two just murdered my high.

1159
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:24,547
Sell that for seven a pop.

1160
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:25,423
Little expensive, don't you think?

1161
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:27,290
Seven's the price.

1162
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:29,527
Where you goin'?

1163
00:53:29,615 --> 00:53:31,409
Gotta see a girl about a dress.

1164
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:38,912
Yeah.

1165
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,941
- What the...
- Fuck, it's Milton.

1166
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:44,084
It's gonna disturb...

1167
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,429
Hey, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1168
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:49,756
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1169
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:52,283
Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake the baby?

1170
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:53,677
No, no, no, it's all
good, it's all good.

1171
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:55,137
He's just settling down.
He's in the nursery with Tami.

1172
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:56,622
Come in, come in.

1173
00:53:59,224 --> 00:54:01,059
So it, uh, feel good to be off the boat?

1174
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:03,211
And to not have my CPO up my ass?

1175
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:04,665
Yeah, it does.

1176
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,690
- Hey, uh, when's the wedding?
- I just got tested.

1177
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:08,192
- Oh, cool.
- The wedding is this weekend.

1178
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:09,425
I just hope my dress shoes

1179
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:10,385
are in the garage
where I left them, man.

1180
00:54:10,426 --> 00:54:11,261
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1181
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:13,513
Oh, the...

1182
00:54:13,555 --> 00:54:15,172
The place looks fantastic.

1183
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:18,309
Oh, yeah, well, the inside, at least.

1184
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:20,621
The neighbors wanted to keep
the outside looking like shit.

1185
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:21,771
So.

1186
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:22,815
Did you do all this by yourself?

1187
00:54:22,856 --> 00:54:26,734
Uh, yeah. I mean, it's just some
plaster work and paint, mostly.

1188
00:54:26,776 --> 00:54:28,153
You put tile up in the kitchen too?

1189
00:54:28,194 --> 00:54:31,447
Um, backsplash, yeah.-

1190
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:33,283
- Looks good, man. Damn good.
- Thanks.

1191
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:34,677
How much did
all of this cost you?

1192
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:35,952
Uh, I don't know.

1193
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:37,263
I picked up most of this stuff for free

1194
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,788
at condemned houses and work sites.

1195
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,331
Hmm.

1196
00:54:40,356 --> 00:54:43,960
Um, I mean, I guess I bought
some stuff, too, though.

1197
00:54:44,002 --> 00:54:46,296
Uh, I put in some hours.

1198
00:54:46,337 --> 00:54:47,609
You should've told me.

1199
00:54:48,047 --> 00:54:49,191
Yeah, I would've thrown you some cash

1200
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:50,967
or reduced your rent or something.

1201
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:51,968
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1202
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,281
What do you think you spent?

1203
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:56,351
Uh, five...

1204
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:57,849
six grand, maybe?

1205
00:54:57,891 --> 00:54:59,281
I don't know.

1206
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:01,311
Why don't I split it with you?

1207
00:55:01,352 --> 00:55:02,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1208
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:04,164
Did the work. Might as well.

1209
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:07,108
- Great.
- All right, cool.

1210
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,328
- Shoes.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:10,504
Just back there in the garage.

1212
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:12,197
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

1213
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:16,302
- Backsplash, huh?
- That's the backsplash, yeah.

1214
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:25,187
Go away.

1215
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:27,159
Mommy?

1216
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:34,536
I'm ready for you to
take my picture now.

1217
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,697
Franny.

1218
00:55:37,722 --> 00:55:39,817
Hang on. Let me get my phone.

1219
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:50,661
Oh.

1220
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,036
Okay, smile.

1221
00:55:53,738 --> 00:55:56,622
Oh, look how beautiful you are.

1222
00:55:56,991 --> 00:56:00,119
A little to the side.

1223
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,043
Give it to me, dom top daddy!

1224
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:09,587
Take it all, you uber-masculine slut!

1225
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,882
Flip fuck?

1226
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:14,884
Sure.

1227
00:56:14,926 --> 00:56:16,028
What's my name?

1228
00:56:16,052 --> 00:56:17,553
Nick.

1229
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:19,156
I said what's my name?

1230
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,599
Nick Jonas!

1231
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:53,525
