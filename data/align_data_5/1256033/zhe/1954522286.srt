Does it bother you,

'Cause you know, you and me...

懂吧 活在当下

86
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,741
Of course, my fondness
for classic science fiction
虽说我的确需要关注未来
因为我的工作嘛

87
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,584
does draw my attention backwards,
当然啦 我对经典科幻小说的喜爱

00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,674
but those stories often
take place in the future.

不是啥好不好的

checking of the message.

Look, I was going over the schematics
on my zero-G toilet,

No one knows exactly when,
but at some point

something way worse than a puppet
is gonna pop out of that box.

145
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,764
against the banality
of a malfunctioning toilet
和厕所故障的平凡特性的对立

146
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,823
that provides the comic fodder here.
这是个喜剧素材哦

147
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,173
Check your messages.
快读你的信息

148

All right,
this is an exact duplicate

00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:01,656
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Disposal System
Wolowitz零重力人类废物处理系统
的复制品

150
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,685
as deployed on the
International Space Station.
为国际空间站设计

151
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:08,148
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?
你的意思不是Wolowitz
零重力人类废物排放系统吧?

152
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,061
Good one.
这不错

153
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:15,951
It's hilarious. Now...
太好笑了 现在...

154
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:18,628
Here's an approximation
这里有空间站里

155
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,487
of the spare parts
available on the Space Station.
有可能找到的所有零件

156
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,568
We gotta find a way,
using nothing but this,
我们要想出一个方法 只用这些

157
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,624
to reinforce this so the waste material
avoids the spinning turbine.
来改造这个 那样废物就能避开
旋转的涡轮机了

158
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:29,052
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
你是说那样就碰不到风扇了?

159
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,810
I have to say,
我得说

160
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:38,358
I thought the toilet humor would
get less funny with repetition.
我想这厕所幽默再说下去
就不这么好笑了

161
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,987
Apparently, there is no law
很显然 没有法律规定
要减少带太空大便返回嘛

162
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:42,639
of diminishing comedic returns
with space poop.
- 嘿 Leonard

Manhattan Project.

What's up?
什么事?

167
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,715
Tonight's my date with Penny

168

and since we haven't been able
to connect by phone...

169
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,536
I'm sorry, it's been broken.

170
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,552

- Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.
- 电邮也不行
- 对 那也是 所有东西都坏了

171
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,083
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.
总之 我只是想知道你有没有
什么最后的建议

172
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,930
All right, well,
off the top of my head,
好的 眼下我能想到的就是

173
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,175
I think the most important thing
with Penny is to go really slow.
和Penny在一起最重要的事
就是要慢一点

174
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,358
I mean, glacial.
我是说 冷淡

175
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,910
Guys come onto her all the time,
so, you need to set yourself apart.
追她的男人多的是 所以
你得把自己和他们区别开

176
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:29,765
Be a little shy,
害羞一点

177
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,874
don't make too much eye contact.
不要做太多眼神接触

178
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:36,461
And, you know, treat her
with, like, cool detachment
把她当作外人一样对待

179
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,851
and-and, you know, fear.
还有... 害怕

180
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,242
- Fear?
- Yeah, like,
- 害怕?
- 对 就像

181
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:45,999
you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.
你会怕如果你碰她一下 她会碎那样

182
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,672
Well, that plays
right into my wheelhouse.
哦 这我还蛮擅长的

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,628
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.

Thanks, Leonard.
谢了 Leonard

185
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,047
What is that thing anyway?
那东西到底是啥?

186
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,634
You don't know what this is?
你不知道这是什么?

187
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,761
Good. Get out.
好的 滚出去

188
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:07,222
Be afraid of Penny.
要害怕Penny

189
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:08,977
Nice. Very crafty.
不错哦 相当狡猾

190
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:13,123
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.
这建议也不是搅局
只是没有那么有用而已

191
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:16,193
For what it's worth, my mother says
不管怎样 我妈妈说过

192
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:18,255
that when we deceive
for personal gain,
当我们为了个人利益去骗人时

193
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,146
we make Jesus cry.
我们会把耶稣弄哭的

194
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,952
All right, what if we use
this two-inch PVC
好的 如果我们用
这两英尺的聚氯乙烯

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,871
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.
- 来改造中心支撑结构怎样?
- 不行

196
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,311
It might work for the Japanese
and the Americans,
那可能会对日本人和美国人有用

197
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:41,585
but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?
但你见过他们弄上去的
俄罗斯人的块头吗?

198
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:47,940
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.
这东西得能撑住
一餐丰盛的土豆大餐

199
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,214
I feel terrible.
我感觉很糟糕

200
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,849
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.
如果你能帮忙的话
可能你会感觉好一点

201
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,792
I deliberately tried
to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
我故意破坏Stuart和Penny的约会

202
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,414
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.
你当然会感觉很糟糕啦
因果轮回要糟报应了

203
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,026
You don't really believe
in that superstition, do you?
你不会真的相信那鬼话吧?

204
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,028
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.
这不是迷信 这其实是在信仰牛顿
(牛顿也是神学专家)

205
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:11,031
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.
对于每个动作
都有一个平等的对立的反应

206
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,035
Leonard pretends to be a friend
and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Leonard假装是朋友
而实际上则是个两面的贱人

207
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,081
Therefore, he is reborn
as a banana slug.
所以 他会转世投胎成
一个香蕉蛞蝓

208
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:25,880
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
这其实是个很好的系统
对吧 一报还一报

209
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,044
Speaking of what goes around
comes around...
说到一报还一报...

210
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,217
Okay, look.
好的 听着

211
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:34,172
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here,
与其试着改造这东西的结构

212
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,807
what if we just ran another line,
bypass it entirely?
还不如我们扯出一条线
来完全回避它

213
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:39,559
It won't work. The diameter
of the tubing is insufficient.
这没用的 管道的直径不够

214
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,729
What if we reposition
the collection tank?
那换换集污舱的位置怎么样?

215
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,522
It won't work. No way to mount it.
没用的 没法安装

216
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,122
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live
好吧 我有个主意
我们改名换姓 然后去

217
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,819
with my cousin and her husband, Avi,
in Israel?
以色列和我的表亲
和她丈夫Avi一起住怎么样?

218
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,242
That could work.
倒是一招

219
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,192
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?
- 早上好
- 早上好 什么事?

220
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,443
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a zero-gravity...
没 我们只是在熬夜修一个
零重力...

221
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:04,695
pasta maker.
意粉机

222
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,089
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
我正要去煮咖啡 你要吗?

223
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,591
No, thanks. I have coffee.
谢啦 我自己有

224
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,135
Great. So how'd it go
with Stuart last night?
好的 昨晚跟Stuart怎么样?

225
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,847
I really don't want
to talk about it.
不堪回首啊

226
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,756
Yeah. Right. Sure.
是啊 没错 当然

227
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,971
The thing is,
before you guys went out,
但是呢 你们出门之前

228
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,283
I spoke to him and...
我俩有过谈话...

229
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,271
I said I don't want
to talk about it.
我说了 我不想回首

230
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,834
I just... I kind of...
我只是...有点...

231
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,221
What goes on between me and Stuart
is none of your business.
我俩的事与你无关

232
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,985
So just leave it alone, okay?
别八卦了 行吗?

233
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:38,734
If you want to clean up your karma,
go get my freakin' latte.
要想下辈子投好胎 就给我煮杯拿铁去

234
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:50,523
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge
等下 我找到了这个 看看能否...

235
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,800
this little piece of PVC
behind the support rod.
把这块PVC楔进载体棒后面

236
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,969
You're overestimating
the tensile strength
你高估了你做的基础部分的抗张强度

237
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,637
of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon 我知道自己在干什么

238
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,514
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
如果你知道 那这放咖啡桌的地方

239
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:01,337
If you knew what you were doing,
there wouldn't be a space toilet
就不该摆着你的太空厕所

240
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,269
where my coffee table should be.
Howard 等等

241
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,646
Howard, wait.
为什么不用这个代替PVC

242
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,069
Why don't you use this
instead of the PVC
来保持横向滤波器装配到位呢?

243
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,401
to keep the transverse
filter assembly in place?
这又不是太空站的部件

244
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:13,284
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.
这是比萨饼盒子里的

245
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,076
This is the thing from the pizza box
为了不让奶酪粘在盒子上

246
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,867
that keeps the lid
from touching the cheese.
干这个用的? 在印度 奶酪就会粘盒子啊

247
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:21,203
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
当然了 印度那么穷 还经常爆发霍乱

248
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,029
Of course, we also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera,
所以盒子粘上奶酪也不算啥

249
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,793
so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.
- 你要去哪?
- 漫画店

250
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,797
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
好主意 我也要休息下

251
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,220
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- 我也是
- 等宇航员能安全排便了

252
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,844
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store
你们才能去漫画店

253
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,305
when man can once again
safely poop in space.
为什么Leonard能去?

254
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:41,599
Why does Leonard get to go?
因为Penny的事 搞得他心烦意乱

255
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,887
'Cause he's upset
over his situation with Penny
如果他再讲一遍 我就扁死他

256
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,021
and if I have to hear about it again,
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- 感谢理解 Howard
- 我支持你 好姐妹

257
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,524
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
好了 要模拟实验一下了

258
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,719
All right, I think we've got
a prototype ready to test.
把那塑料盒给我

259
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,072
Hand me that Tupperware.
好沉啊

260
00:13:58,447 --> 00:13:59,396
That's heavy.
当然沉了 这是我妈做的肉馅糕

261
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,702
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
一直是我测试厕所的道具

262
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,424
It's been testing toilets
for generations.
容我说一句

263
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:07,817
I must say,
如果跟麻省理工汇报下你现在的详细情况

264
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:11,457
I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances
你的硕士学位就飞鸟

265
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:13,923
might entitle you
to a refund on your master's degree.
好了 模拟零重力人类废物处理实验

266
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:19,149
Okay, simulated zero-gravity
human waste disposal test
放入肉馅糕模拟物...

267
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,055
with meat loaf analog in...
三 二 一

268
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,267
three, two, one.
好赞

269
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:32,780
Fascinating.
你觉得问题在哪?

270
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,785
What do you think the problem is?
面包渣太少了

271
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,721
Not enough bread crumbs.
Stuart 咱俩要谈谈

272
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:48,374
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- 好啊 怎么了?
- Penny的事 我帮倒忙了

273
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,099
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- 我想道歉
- 没 你的建议挺好啊

274
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,171
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- 啊?
- 是啊 慢慢来很管用

275
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,757
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
开玩笑吧

276
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:58,495
You're kidding.
在我身上就不管用

277
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,776
Never worked for me.
昨晚吃饭时 我按你说的做了

278
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:03,719
Last night at dinner,
I did what you told me.
放慢速度 保持距离

279
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,447
I went really slow,
I kept my distance,
两杯酒下肚 我俩就去车里嘿咻了

280
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,061
and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.
酒? 我没说给她喝酒啊

281
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:12,639
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.
这不是重点 糟糕的事才开始

282
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,568
It doesn't matter,
that's where it all went to hell.
