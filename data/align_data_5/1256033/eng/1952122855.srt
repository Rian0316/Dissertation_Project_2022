1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,769
Smell that?

2
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,352
That's the smell of new comic books.

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,225
They're on me today, boys.

4
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:19,597
You're paying?

5
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:21,941
Have you been selling
your sperm again?

6
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,762
No, I'm celebrating.

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,816
As we speak,
the space shuttle is docking

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,586
at the International Space Station

9
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,212
where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

10
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:36,369
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

11
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:41,153
Just think. Thanks to your hard work,
an international crew of astronauts

12
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,128
will "boldly go
where no man has gone before."

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,849
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

14
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,781
The combination of
the <i>Star Trek</i> reference

15
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,740
and the play on words involving
the double-meaning of the verb "to go"

16
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,638
suggests that Leonard is mocking
your efforts in space plumbing.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,933
Okay, make your little jokes,

18
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,129
but of the four of us,
I'm the only one making

19
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,437
any real-world contribution
to science and technology.

20
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,272
He's right. This is an important
achievement, for two reasons.

21
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,573
Number one...

22
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:10,279
and, of course, number two!

23
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:14,466
Clever!

24
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,422
Playing on the use
of cardinal numbers

25
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,799
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

26
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,626
Here, Sheldon,
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

27
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,196
It's mind-blowing.

28
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,770
Excuse me.

29
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,505
Spoiler alert.

30
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,842
I didn't spoil anything.

31
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,484
You told me it's mind-blowing.

32
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,637
So, my mind is going into it
pre-blown.

33
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:40,307
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

34
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:41,809
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:44,020
Said the Grinch to Christmas.

36
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,288
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?

37
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:53,027
Remember I went out with Penny,
a couple weeks ago?

38
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,303
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.

39
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,486
You went to the bar
and made a fool of yourself

40
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,329
trying to pick up strange women.

41
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:03,988
What about it?

42
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,169
The thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Too bad.

44
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,180
I guess the thing to do now
is just pick yourself up,

45
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:16,302
dust yourself off,
forget it and move on.

46
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,818
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

47
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,112
'Cause we're going out
again tomorrow.

48
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,519
Excuse me, Stuart.

49
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,260
Have you read the new Flash?

50
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,956
Well, I have
and it will knock your socks off!

51
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,442
Good luck getting them back on.

52
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:39,200
This is probably my last shot with Penny
and I don't want to screw it up.

53
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,768
Nobody wants that.

54
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,421
So, here's my question:
It's the second date,

55
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,705
you think she'll be expecting things

56
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,840
to get physical?

57
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:52,335
Gee...

58
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,761
My initial reaction is "no,"

59
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:59,345
but let me think about it
and get back to you.

60
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,137
So, you'll give me a call?

61
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,389
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

62
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,165
Or nobody calls anyone.

63
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,292
Interesting.

64
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,685
Penny's current suitor asking advice
from her former suitor.

65
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:15,361
You know, thanks
for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.

66
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:17,858
Hey, wanna make sure
he gets nowhere with Penny

67
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:20,658
without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

68
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:22,325
I'm listening.

69
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,681
Just tell him to do everything
you've done with her

70
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,496
for the last two years.

71
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,023
Subtitles: The FW Team

72
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,923
- How's it going?
- Good, good. You?

73
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,141
Fine.

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,450
Can I ask you something?

75
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,367
Sure.

76
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:06,848
You know your friend Stuart?

77
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,999
He asked me out again
and I said yes,

78
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,669
and then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

79
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:14,920
About what?

80
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:18,468
Does it bother you,
me going out with one of your friends?

81
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,967
'Cause you know, you and me...

82
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,788
No, that's the past.

83
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,482
I'm really more
of a "right now" kind of guy.

84
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,458
You know, living in the moment.

85
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,812
Although I do have to live a little
in the future, 'cause that's my job.

86
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:34,411
Of course, my fondness
for classic science fiction

87
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,254
does draw my attention backwards,

88
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,344
but those stories often
take place in the future.

89
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,824
In conclusion, no,
it doesn't bother me.

90
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,032
Okay, well,
that's really cool of you.

91
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:52,584
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"

92
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:56,645
In that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

93
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,920
About Stuart?

94
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Love to.

95
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,214
He's very shy.

96
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,493
How do I make him feel
more comfortable around me?

97
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:06,677
First of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

98
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,192
Really?

99
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,031
Stuart thrives under pressure.

100
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:13,381
That's why he works in
a comic book store.

101
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,863
It's Stuart.

102
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,368
You're not going to answer it?

103
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,498
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.

104
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,666
You're making an assumption.

105
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,378
Perhaps the comic book store
is on fire.

106
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,048
And he needs your assistance.

107
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,266
Why would he call me?

108
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,576
We don't know.

109
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,223
And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

110
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,018
I'm not answering the phone.

111
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,191
Answer the phone, Leonard.

112
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,612
There, it went to voice mail.

113
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,246
Aren't you going to check
your messages?

114
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,334
You have to check your messages!

115
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,231
The living of a message
is one half of a social contract

116
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,131
which is completed by the
checking of the message.

117
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,926
If that contract breaks down,

118
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,284
then all social contracts break down
and we descend into anarchy.

119
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,749
It must be hell inside your head.

120
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:37,548
At times.

121
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,191
Guys, we have a code red.

122
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,202
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert,
the computer worm,

123
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,531
or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

124
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,867
Look, I was going over the schematics
on my zero-G toilet,

125
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,389
and I made a teeny tiny mistake

126
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,330
on the specifications
for the diverter valve.

127
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,289
How teeny tiny?

128
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,332
It's gonna fail
after about ten flushes.

129
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,296
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.

130
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,049
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

131
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,019
No one knows exactly when,
but at some point

132
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,887
something way worse than a puppet
is gonna pop out of that box.

133
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,724
Have you notified NASA?

134
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,538
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?

135
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:18,096
"I screwed up your toilet
and there's gonna be crap floating

136
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,272
"all over your nice
shiny space station"?

137
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,091
What are you gonna do?

138
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

139
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:26,589
So, what do you need us for?

140
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,792
He can't figure out how to fix it.

141
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,366
You said you were
gonna be supportive.

142
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,119
I'm trying, but you have to admit
this is pretty damn funny.

143
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:37,498
I agree.

144
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,372
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech
nature of space exploration

145
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,434
against the banality
of a malfunctioning toilet

146
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,493
that provides the comic fodder here.

147
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,843
Check your messages.

148
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,106
All right,
this is an exact duplicate

149
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,326
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Disposal System

150
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,355
as deployed on the
International Space Station.

151
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:05,818
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

152
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,731
Good one.

153
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:13,621
It's hilarious. Now...

154
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,298
Here's an approximation

155
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:19,157
of the spare parts
available on the Space Station.

156
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:21,238
We gotta find a way,
using nothing but this,

157
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:24,294
to reinforce this so the waste material
avoids the spinning turbine.

158
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,722
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

159
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:32,480
I have to say,

160
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:36,028
I thought the toilet humor would
get less funny with repetition.

161
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:37,657
Apparently, there is no law

162
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,309
of diminishing comedic returns
with space poop.

163
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,076
You busy?

164
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,320
Classified, Leonard.

165
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,282
Yeah, it's a regular
Manhattan Project.

166
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,492
What's up?

167
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:57,385
Tonight's my date with Penny

168
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,580
and since we haven't been able
to connect by phone...

169
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,206
I'm sorry, it's been broken.

170
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,222
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.

171
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,753
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

172
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,600
All right, well,
off the top of my head,

173
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:15,845
I think the most important thing
with Penny is to go really slow.

174
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,028
I mean, glacial.

175
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:25,580
Guys come onto her all the time,
so, you need to set yourself apart.

176
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,435
Be a little shy,

177
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:30,544
don't make too much eye contact.

178
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,131
And, you know, treat her
with, like, cool detachment

179
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:36,521
and-and, you know, fear.

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,912
- Fear?
- Yeah, like,

181
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,669
you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

182
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,342
Well, that plays
right into my wheelhouse.

183
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,298
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.

184
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:53,036
Thanks, Leonard.

185
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:54,717
What is that thing anyway?

186
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,304
You don't know what this is?

187
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,431
Good. Get out.

188
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:04,892
Be afraid of Penny.

189
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,647
Nice. Very crafty.

190
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,793
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

191
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,863
For what it's worth, my mother says

192
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,925
that when we deceive
for personal gain,

193
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,816
we make Jesus cry.

194
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:28,502
All right, what if we use
this two-inch PVC

195
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,421
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.

196
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,861
It might work for the Japanese
and the Americans,

197
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:37,135
but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

198
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:43,490
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

199
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,764
I feel terrible.

200
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,399
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

201
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:54,342
I deliberately tried
to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.

202
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,964
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.

203
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,576
You don't really believe
in that superstition, do you?

204
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,578
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.

205
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,581
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,585
Leonard pretends to be a friend
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

207
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,631
Therefore, he is reborn
as a banana slug.

208
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,430
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

209
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,594
Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

210
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,767
Okay, look.

211
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:29,722
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here,

212
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,357
what if we just ran another line,
bypass it entirely?

213
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,109
It won't work. The diameter
of the tubing is insufficient.

214
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,279
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

215
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,072
It won't work. No way to mount it.

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,672
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live

217
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:44,369
with my cousin and her husband, Avi,
in Israel?

218
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,792
That could work.

219
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,742
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

220
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,993
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a zero-gravity...

221
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,245
pasta maker.

222
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,639
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?

223
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,141
No, thanks. I have coffee.

224
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,685
Great. So how'd it go
with Stuart last night?

225
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,397
I really don't want
to talk about it.

226
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,306
Yeah. Right. Sure.

227
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,521
The thing is,
before you guys went out,

228
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,833
I spoke to him and...

229
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,821
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

230
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:21,384
I just... I kind of...

231
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,771
What goes on between me and Stuart
is none of your business.

232
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,535
So just leave it alone, okay?

233
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,284
If you want to clean up your karma,
go get my freakin' latte.

234
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,073
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge

235
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,350
this little piece of PVC
behind the support rod.

236
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,519
You're overestimating
the tensile strength

237
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,187
of the substructure you're building.

238
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,064
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

239
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,887
If you knew what you were doing,
there wouldn't be a space toilet

240
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,819
where my coffee table should be.

241
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,196
Howard, wait.

242
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,619
Why don't you use this
instead of the PVC

243
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:05,951
to keep the transverse
filter assembly in place?

244
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,834
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

245
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,626
This is the thing from the pizza box

246
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,417
that keeps the lid
from touching the cheese.

247
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,753
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.

248
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,579
Of course, we also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

249
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:23,343
so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

250
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,347
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.

251
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,770
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.

252
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,394
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store

253
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,855
when man can once again
safely poop in space.

254
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,149
Why does Leonard get to go?

255
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,437
'Cause he's upset
over his situation with Penny

256
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,571
and if I have to hear about it again,
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

257
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,074
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.

258
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,269
All right, I think we've got
a prototype ready to test.

259
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:52,622
Hand me that Tupperware.

260
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:54,946
That's heavy.

261
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,252
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.

262
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,974
It's been testing toilets
for generations.

263
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,367
I must say,

264
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:07,007
I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances

265
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,473
might entitle you
to a refund on your master's degree.

266
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,699
Okay, simulated zero-gravity
human waste disposal test

267
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,605
with meat loaf analog in...

268
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,817
three, two, one.

269
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,330
Fascinating.

270
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,335
What do you think the problem is?

271
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,271
Not enough bread crumbs.

272
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,924
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.

273
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,649
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,

274
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:49,721
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.

275
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,307
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.

276
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:54,045
You're kidding.

277
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,326
Never worked for me.

278
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,269
Last night at dinner,
I did what you told me.

279
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,997
I went really slow,
I kept my distance,

280
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:04,611
and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

281
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:08,189
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

282
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,118
It doesn't matter,
that's where it all went to hell.

283
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,669
During the kissing?

284
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:17,146
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

285
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,795
No, everything was good
and really hot.

286
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,672
And I said,

287
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,914
"Oh, Penny,"

288
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,207
and right where she was supposed to say,
"Oh, Stuart," she said...

289
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:30,512
your name.

290
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,769
That is your name, right?

291
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,276
I'm sorry. That must've been
the last thing you wanted to hear.

292
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:48,720
It beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

293
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,534
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

294
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,594
No doubt, no doubt.

295
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,074
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

296
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,336
Not your fault.

297
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,190
Yeah, how about that?

298
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:09,932
- See you soon.
- Sure.

299
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,609
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."

300
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,612
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.

301
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,530
What's classified?

302
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:33,782
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.

303
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:37,205
Well, they've deployed our solution.

304
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,200
Let's just all hope it works.

305
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,761
I don't see why I have to worry.

306
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:44,556
My career's not hanging
in the balance.

307
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,177
That was a joke.

308
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:54,151
It's funny,

309
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,241
because it's true.

310
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:02,879
Leonard, could you pass
the soy sauce, please?

311
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,606
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

312
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,713
Yeah, I said "Leonard."

313
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,753
Yes, you did, didn't you?

314
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,535
What the hell is that?

315
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:19,294
Meatloaf.

316
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,666
What was it doing on the ceiling?

317
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,924
That's classified.

318
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,790
<i>Houston,
International Space Station.</i>

319
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,120
<i>We have a little situation up here.</i>

320
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,455
<i>We'd like to make
an unscheduled space walk.</i>

321
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,359
<i>I.S.S., Houston.</i>

322
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:45,037
<i>Which crew members would be
involved in this E.V.A.?</i>

323
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:48,317
<i>Houston, we'd all like
to step outside for a few minutes.</i>

324
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,558
<i>I.S.S., I'm afraid
we can't authorize that.</i>

325
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,486
<i>Houston,
this is more of an FYI call.</i>

326
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,605
<i>We are basically out the door.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
