00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,400
你们莉莉阿姨和马修叔叔的婚礼前几周,有些奇异的事件总会发生
In the weeks leading up to aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's wedding, some weird stuff started happening.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,250
我的胃怎么开始疼了?
Why does my stomach hurt?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,440
对不起  宝贝 我早些时候吃了个冰淇淋
I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,440
宝贝  你知道我们是心有灵犀的
Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,070
等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,970
你是说你们一个人感觉到什么了
Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something,

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,220
- 另外一个也感觉得到? - 你们真是个共生体?
- the other feels it, too? - Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,470
- 我们不是 - 难道不是?
- No, we're not. - Oh, really?

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,840
那天又怎么说?
What about the other day?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,380
- 我需要些鸡蛋 - 我跟你一起去拿
- Oh, I need to get some eggs. - Oh, I'll come with you.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,270
那是因为我们喜欢一起分享时光 不代表我们是共生体啊
Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,470
真的吗?
Really?

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,270
那你们计划是怎么回事
Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,390
结婚两周前不是要分居?
before your wedding sleeping apart?

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,100
我们不这样是因为...
Okay, we decided not to do that because of...

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,430
指导
Logistics.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,480
- 新婚指导 - 就是新婚指导
- Wedding logistics. - Frickin' logistics, man.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,920
这些指导都把事情都搞乱了
They mess everything up.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,380
你们不做是因为你们不能做到
You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,160
- 我们当然可以 - 那你们咋不做啊?
- Sure we could. - Then why don't you?

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,500
你可以去我那住啊
You can stay with me.

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,090
这样会使我们的新婚夜更特别
It would make our wedding night more special.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
- 好 说定了 - 好
- Okay, let's do it. - Done.

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,360
- 我去拿杯啤酒 - 我和你一起
- I'm gonna go grab a beer. - I'll come with you.

25

My mom is driving me crazy about the wedding music.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,380
她就去了牙买加一趟 突然就说

37

这样的宴会不能没有爵士鼓音乐
"not a party without steel drums."

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,140
难道你们不知道别再施压
Doesn't everybody know you're not supposed to stress out

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,050
给一个就要结婚的新娘吗?!

00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,040
说说调料怎么回事
Okay, sauce, go.

- Long story. I'll tell you later. - Yeah.

42
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,670
是个荤段子吧?
It's a dirty story, isn't it?

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,170
你们去吃饭然后 在厨房做的时候被发现了

你真认为你能和莉莉分居两周吗?
So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,640
莉莉和我没有你们说的那么夸张

别忘了给我弄"晚安"录像带

你给她做了个你说的"晚安"的录像带?

太温馨了

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,460
你咋不做接吻的呢? 我就喜欢看两个人欲罢不能的样子
Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,990
真该死
Damn it.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,820
没人能在我们结婚前让我们静一静
Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.

58
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,130
- 都是什么啊 - 很多原因

62
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,350
549.99美元  是不是有点准?
Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,910
- 你想记住我们结婚的日子啊? - 不是  我在训练
- Did you memorize our registry? - No, I'm training.

泰德  罗宾  都过来
Ted, Robin, get in here!

66
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,500
你们都觉得很难和我交朋友吧? 因为我太优秀了
You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?

67
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,630
和你做朋友确实挺难的 继续说...
Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.

68
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,300
以后会越来越难的

Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,080
你说笑呢?
Are you kidding?

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,020
T.P.I.R.不光是个电视娱乐节目 (节目简称)
T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television,

76
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,540
它也是我们整个经济制度的缩写
it's a microcosm of our entire economic system--

77
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,570
是资本主义的乌托邦  消费者因为他们的努力而获得奖励

还有帅哥坐在车里 (节目奖品是车)
Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.

Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.

84
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,090
我准备好了
- I'm ready! - Ta-da-da-da-da...

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,990
- 莉莉 你太美了 - 我就知道  我很漂亮

88
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,690
于此同时 我正在为伴郎致词彩排

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,040
开始了
Here goes.

90
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,300
大家好  我是泰德・莫斯比 马修最好的朋友
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.

91
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,860
- 震撼的开场白? - 相当不错
Strong opening, right? That's fantastic.

92
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,760
马修春季毕业后就将成为一名律师了
When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer.

93
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,140
但你们知道马修 曾经有过一次犯罪记录吗?
But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record?

94
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,120
对了就是开车去Cape Cod的路上
That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod,

95
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,470
马修自己开车 在路上被警察叫停下来
Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.

96
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,510
糟了
Oh, crap.

97
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,530
糟了
Oh, crap.

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,750
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,070
你不能在我婚礼上说这个
You cannot tell that story at my wedding.

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,770
我全家都要去
My entire family's gonna be there.

我小表弟  我妈  我祖母 我祖父  一家之长
My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.

102
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,040
你祖父3年已经去世了
That grandpa died three years ago.

103
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,990
他最喜欢的孙子结婚
His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,250
我想他总能从阴间 抽出一天时间来参加吧
I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.

105
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,350
Whoo!

106
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,573
Whoo-whoo!

107
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:36,801

108
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,741
Whoo-hoo!

109
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,283
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

110
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:48,810
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

111
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,190
- 选哪个 "A"还是"B" - 啥玩意?
- So which one, "A" or "B"? - What was that?

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,100
我得想好参赛出场时怎么个跑法
I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say,

113
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,120
当他们说  "巴尼  下来参赛"
"Barney Stinson, come on down!"

114
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,810
我没反应过来你在干吗 能再来一遍吗?
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?

115
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
当然
Yeah, of course.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,630
真搞笑
Hey! Very funny.

117
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,620
就因为这个  等我赢完所有奖项 到时候只给你们
Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting

118
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,180
Rice-A-Roni和Turtle Wax (一种类似麦片的食品)和(龟牌蜡)
is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,030
那300美元就这样打水漂了?
It's $300 just to take the bust in?

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,090
求你了  同情同情我吧
Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me.

121
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,760
我下周六就结婚了 我太瘦了穿不上婚纱
I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress.

122
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,530
我试着增肥都不行
I lost all this weight without even trying.

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,720
还在吗?
Hello?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,080
- 怎么了? - 她骂我"婊子"然后挂了
- What happened? - She called me a bitch and hung up.

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,450
我真不知道怎么办了 我想我必须得付300美元
Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.

126
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,060
就这样付300美元? 莉莉  你疯了吗?
Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy?

127
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,190
这还不是问题的关键 问题在于这简直就是猛吃的许可证
This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat.

128
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,600
什么是你总想吃的 但是因为怕发胖不敢吃
Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?

129
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,330
来个法雅牌巧克力浆果酒心糖

希望你能满意我的新的致词
Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast.

134
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,440
这次没有荤的了
There's nothing sexual.

135
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,930
这个故事是关于 你俩恋爱关系的重要时刻的
It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.

136
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,980
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

137

- Nice. - Right? That's great.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,870
当我们还是大一新生的时候
Back when we were all freshman

140
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,940
马修和莉莉刚刚进入恋爱状态
and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship...

141
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,890
那天是凌晨4点  我说得都是实话 而且没有错过任何细节
It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted.

142
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,750
我们都饿了
We were starving.

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,550
我出去找点零食 当我回来的时候...
So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...

144
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,710
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you, too.

145
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,060
我知道这太快了 但我真的很高兴你这么说
I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.

146
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:47,828
Yeah.

147
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,980
这就是你要当着我全家说的?
So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family:

148
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,640
喝酒  往屋里带女孩  吃垃圾食品
drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.

149
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,000
兄弟  你都快30了 你妈听到你吃垃圾食品会不高兴吗?
Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?

150
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,410
泰德  "营养学"不重要!
Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important.

151
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,020
关键是  莉莉还不知道这事
Also, so Lily's never heard that story before.

152
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,210
当她发现我第一次 对她说我爱你的时候
How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said "I love you" to her,

153
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,060
实际上是对你和Funyuns说的  她会怎样? (一种洋葱做的食品)
I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns?

154
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,010
那谁管啊  你确实爱她 而且你仍然爱着她啊
But who cares? You did love her. And you still do.

155
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,890
你确实很爱吃Funyuns而且这事不无聊 (一种洋葱做的食品)
And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.

156
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,861
- Hey, Lil. - Hey.

157
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,440
嗨?那个就行了呗?
Hey? That's it?

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,510
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

159
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,530
你们俩这几个晚上都是分居的
Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart.

160
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,580
我知道有的人已经 开始傻笑  哭泣  上窜下跳
I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down,

161
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,550
莉莉怎么样?
and then whatever Lily would do.

162
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,060
直到现在我还记得 麦克莱恩酒吧的菜单
Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's

163
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,730
至少有11种油炸的开胃菜
is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers.

164
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,720
那天晚上 莉莉阿姨都点了
That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.

165
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,520
看看
Check it out.

166
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,100
想象一下... 想象一下 如果...
Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will,

167
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,010
这是The Price Is Right轮盘上 的一美元的地方
that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel.

168
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,070
准备好了吗?
Ready?

169
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,470
已经很接近了
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.

170
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,950
接近?
Close?

171
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,630
接近?!节目要求猜价准确 不是接近
Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close!

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,740
真是太槽了
Oh, man, this is bad.

173
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,190
如果轮盘这关过不了 我就不能进入决赛了
If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown,

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,220
都白费了!全都白费了!
everything's ruined! It's all ruined!

175
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,120
什么白费了啊? 为什么你把这个看的这么重啊
What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?

176
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,130
好吧  坐下吧 我给你们讲点东西就明白了
Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something.

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,930
这就是我去参加The Price Is Right的原因
The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right

178
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,250
因为我觉得我该去见见我生父了
is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.

179
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
- 你父亲? - 对
- Your father? - That's right.

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,850
我父亲...是鲍勃・巴克
My father... is Bob Barker.

181
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,300
- 你爸爸...是鲍勃・巴克? - 就是
- Your dad... is Bob Barker? - That's right.

182
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
The Price Is Right的主持人 鲍勃・巴克?
The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?

183
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,770
就是我爸
That's Pops.

184
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,210
- 巴尼? - 怎么了  罗宾?
- Barney? - Yes, Robin?

185
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,170
在这个世界上 你怎么就会认为鲍勃・巴克是你父亲?
Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,390
因为我妈告诉我的 这就是为什么
Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.

187
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,850
妈  谁是我爸爸啊?
Mom, who's my dad?

188
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,750
学校其他孩子都知道他们爸爸是谁
All the other kids at school know who their dad is.

189
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,950
- 谁是我爸爸啊? - 我不知道
- Who's mine? - Oh, I don't know.

190
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,090
就是他
That guy.

191
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,070
看  爸爸  我拿到A了
Look, Dad, I got straight A's!

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,820
爸爸  猜猜我万圣节该扮谁啊?
Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,290
想玩棒球吗  爸爸?
Want to play some catch, Pop?

194
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,340
现在我要去洛杉矶 去参加这个节目
So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show,

195
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,910
赢得最后决赛
win the Showcase Showdown,

196
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,560
让他为我感到骄傲 然后告诉他我的身世
make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.

197
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,360
你要在国家电视台上告诉 鲍勃・巴克 你是他的儿子?
You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?

198
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,190
你们为什么都不相信啊?
Why is this so hard for you people to believe?

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,430
放下!
Drop the popper!

200
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,980
莉莉必须在一周半增加5磅体重
Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half,

201
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,260
我的任务就是帮她实现这个目的
and it is my job to help her get there.

202
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,560
这是最好的婚礼膳食了
This is the best wedding diet ever.

203
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,420
- 我瘦了1磅 - 不可能啊
- I lost a pound. - That is impossible.

204
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,510
你已经连续3天顿顿都吃麦当劳了
You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.

205
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,430
我知道《超码的我》里那个家伙全吃那个
I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.

206
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,710
肯定是婚前压力的原因 我们会找到办法解决的
Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake.

207
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,950
莉莉  坐下 给我吃20粒糖
Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge!

208
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,730
开始?
Okay?

209
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,620
别细嚼慢咽  要狼吞虎咽
Don't nibble at it. Attack it!

210
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,050
加油  莉莉  你能吃得更多!
Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!

211
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,850
我不行了
I can't.

212
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,490
吃快点  在你体重还没达到前
Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.

213
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,690
- 我正在吃啊 - 你要哭了啊?
I'm trying. Oh, are you gonna cry?

214
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,470
你要哭吗? 瘦瘦的你哭得出来吗?
You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry?

215
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,130
- 吃  使劲吃 - 好吧!
- Well, eat, damn it, eat! - Okay!

216
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,920
我想我知道怎么做最合适的致词了
Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.

217
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,670
终于好了
- Finally. - Yeah.

218
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,480
晚上好  我是泰德・莫丝比 马修最好的朋友
Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.

219
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,540
- 还是很震撼  不是吗? -恩  不错
- Still strong, right? - Great, yeah.

220
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,610
我非常高兴能和你们分享 去年夏天一个重要的夜晚
I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall

221
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,400
马修和莉莉一起回来
when Marshall and Lily got back together.

222
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,120
然后我们一直呆到晚上10点
Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night,

223
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,940
- 一起喝巧克力牛奶 - 我滋养的太好了
- doing shots of chocolate milk. - Man, I'm well nourished right now!

224
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,460
钙质可以提高牙齿和骨骼的健康
Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.

225
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,390
谢谢  马修 教给我们无需酒精的乐趣
Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.

226
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,590
别谢我  谢谢我父母 交给了我好的滋养方法
Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.

227
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,160
我想这个部分到此为止了
Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part,

228
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,390
但是马修俯身跟莉莉窃窃私语
but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.

229
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,800
你知道我现在想和你做什么吗?
You know what I'd like to do to you right now?

230
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,820
我想握着你的手
I'd like to hold your hand.

231
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,880
我想紧紧地握着你的手
I'd like to hold your hand so hard

232
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,280
让你一周都不能握手
that you're not able to shake hands for a week.

233
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,460
你刚才只是说想握 我的手还是真的要握我的手?
Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?

234
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,360
过了一会  罗宾发现他们...
Then a little later, Robin caught them...

235
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,170
握着对方的手
Oh, um... ...holding hands.

236
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,290
这真是个有趣 体现责任感的夜晚
It was a lovely and responsible night.

237
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,070
为马修和莉莉干杯
To Marshall and Lily.

238
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,790
这是我听到的最烂的致词
That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude.

239
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,740
- 这简直就是无聊 - 本来就是
- It's totally boring. - Exactly.

240
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,000
只要你检查过的致词 就不可能有好的
It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man.

241
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,050
我放弃了
I give up.

242
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,850
我要去读跟耶稣和足迹有关的东西
I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,970
我也放弃了 我不管穿不穿得上了
I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit.

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,470
我实在吃不下了
I can't eat anymore.

245
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,100
我感觉胃都要撑破了
I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.

246
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,670
我知道
I know.

247
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,990
莉莉和我都准备放弃了
And so, Lily and I were both about to give up,

248
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,510
但是如果你们能看到 莉莉穿上那婚纱确实很漂亮
but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress,

249
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,550
我也在这里想大家致词
and here I am giving a toast.

250
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,440
这段时间我一直冥思苦想试着
You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to

251
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,110
找出莉莉和马修在一起的完美时刻
pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple.

252
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,770
但是我发现完美时刻不是
But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't

253
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,920
从他们恋爱这10年中 像大海捞针般的寻找
some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together.

254
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,680
莉莉和马修完美时刻 就发生在两天前
The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.

255
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,140
马修  干吗呢?
Marshall, what are you doing?

256
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,310
去浴室
Going to the bathroom.

257
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,540
浴室在走廊?
In the hall?

258
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,510
梦游
Sleepwalking?

259
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,980
你肯定是醒的
You're wide awake.

260
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,060
- 抢劫? - 兄弟
- Robbing us? - Dude.

261
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,760
整周他都偷偷跑到72nd的一家宾馆
Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd,

262
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,330
去见莉莉
to meet Lily.

263
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,500
- 我想你了 - 没有你我睡不着
- God, I missed you. - I can't sleep without you.

264
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,852
Hey, baby?

265
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,400
- 你能搂我一会吗? - 当然
- Would you be the big spoon for a while? - Sure, baby.

266
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,600
- 增重增的怎么样 - 太糟了
- How's the weight gaining going? - Ugh, terribly.

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,570
没有你我都快崩溃了
I'm too stressed out without you around.

268
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,540
我在这了啊
Well, I'm here now.

269
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,340
最终莉莉和马修 分居试验还是失败了
And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness,

270
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,420
但是他们成功让 莉莉穿上了她的婚纱
but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress.

271
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,150
真的有太多太多 莉莉和马修的故事我可以讲的
You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall,

272
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,610
但是只有一件事你们的明白
but really, the only thing you need to know is

273
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,450
10年的爱情长跑
that ten years into their relationship,

274
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,130
他们仍然不能分开哪怕是一个晚上
they still couldn't spend a single night apart.

275
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,720
愿他们再也不会分开
May they never have to again.
