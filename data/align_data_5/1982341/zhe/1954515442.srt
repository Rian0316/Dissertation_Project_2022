老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第一集

10
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,270
<i>孩子们  在我们快要接近结局</i>
<i>Kids, if there's one</i> <i>big theme to this story--</i>

11
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,420
<i>却又没那么快结尾的故事中</i>
<i>and I swear,</i> <i>we're totally, almost,</i>

12
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,920
<i>有一个贯穿始终的主题  就是机缘</i>
<i>not really all that close</i> <i>to the end-- it's timing.</i>

13
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,760
<i>机缘至关重要</i>
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

14
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
<i>比如  如果不是去参加婚礼</i>
<i>For example, I never</i> <i>would met your mother</i>

15
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>我就不会遇到你们的母亲</i>
<i>if it weren't for a wedding.</i>

16
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>那场最出乎我意料的婚礼</i>
<i>The last wedding</i> <i>I ever thought I'd be at.</i>

17
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,860
你觉得这条领带如何
What do you think of this tie?

18
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,620
感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

19
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,100
我还以为巴尼・史丁森在婚礼前的召唤
Barney Stinson needs you right before his wedding,

20
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,490
是让我帮他处理藏在衣橱里的妓女尸体
you assume there's at least one dead hooker in the closet,

21
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,520
对不对啊
right?

22
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,080
这条有好一点吗
Is this one better?

23
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,580
这条领带棒极了
Look, the tie is great,

24
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
你只是在婚礼前有点小紧张
And, you know, it's perfectly normal

25
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,370
这种现象很正常
to have some pre-wedding jitters.

26
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,030
我不是紧张
I'm not having jitters.

27
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,350
我只是想到  一旦我系上这条领带
It just occurs to me that once I put this tie on,

28
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,100
就不能摘掉了
I can never take it off.

29
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,840
我就得一生一世系着它
I have to wear this tie forever and ever.

30
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,430
虽然这条领带现在很苗条
And sure, this tie's skinny now,

31
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,150
万一它变胖了  对我呼来喝去怎么办
but what happens if it gets fat and starts bossing me around?

32
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,680
我会不会做了个错误的决定
Did I make a mistake?

33
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,180
要是系别的领带  我会更开心吗
Would I have been happier with the other tie?

34
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,000
泰德  我能告诉你个天大的秘密吗
Ted, can I tell you a big secret?

35
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,970
当然
Yeah, of course.

36
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,340
我说的其实不是领带
I'm not really talking about the tie.

37
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,810
我明白  巴尼
No, I got that, Barney.

38
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,310
我在想这整件事会不会是场灾难
I wonder if this whole thing's a disaster.

39
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,100
如果变成史上最烂的婚礼怎么办
What if this is the worst wedding ever?

40
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,270
不可能
Not possible.

41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,590
我们已经参加过史上最烂的婚礼了
We've already been to the worst wedding ever.

42
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,010
小粉拳的婚礼
Punchy's wedding.

43
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,180
马修简直把它毁得一干二净
Marshall really took a two flusher on that one.

44
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,390
<i>马修叔叔毁了</i>
<i>The story of how</i> <i>Uncle Marshall ruined</i>

45
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,960
<i>我朋友小粉拳婚礼的故事</i>
<i>my friend Punchy's wedding</i>

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,010
<i>发生在2011年9月</i>
<i>starts in September, 2011.</i>

47
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,550
<i>小粉拳邀请我做他的伴郎</i>
<i>Punchy had asked me</i> <i>to be his best man.</i>

48
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,120
各位  走之前你们介不介意
Guys, before we go, would you mind

49
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,450
听我读一遍婚礼致辞
reading my wedding toast?

50
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,450
-没问题  -当然可以
- Oh, yeah, no problem. - Sure.

51
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,790
好吧  反正没得选
Um, all right, if I have to.

52
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,810
好吧
All right.

53
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,660
人家准备了各种不同的版本嘛
There's a few different versions.

54
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,050
泰德  你干嘛这么大费周章地写祝词
Ted, why are you working so hard on this toast?

55
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,650
人家小粉拳是在保龄球馆
Punchy belched his proposal

56
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,650
随便拿个唱K的话筒求的婚
through a karaoke mic at a bowling alley.

57
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,600
好吧  我从没跟你们说过
Okay, look, I've never told you guys this,

58
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,110
但这几年来  我一些高中旧友
but over the years, a few of my old high school buddies

59
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,360
纷纷邀请我在婚礼上致辞
have asked me to give wedding toasts,

60
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,070
结果场面都不太好看
and they haven't gone great.

61
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,900
<i>不知怎地  那些婚礼恰恰</i>
<i>Somehow those weddings</i> <i>all fell smack-dab</i>

62
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,070
<i>碰上了我人生最悲剧的时刻</i>
<i>in the worst moments</i> <i>of my life.</i>

63
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,100
琼尔和莫拉的爱情是美好的
Joel and Mora's love is a beautiful thing.

64
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,210
我原以为我也拥有
I thought I had that...

65
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,080
结果我的未婚妻上周在圣坛上离我而去
till my fiancee left me at the altar last week.

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,150
他们不让我说起这个  所以我就不说了
I was asked not to talk about this, so I won't.

67
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,690
我有时夜里会坐在她家门外
I sit outside her house at night sometimes.

68
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,890
她剪头发了
She got a haircut.

69
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,130
上周我失业了之后
After I lost my job last week,

70
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,460
他们就不让我宣读祝词了
uh, I was asked not to give this toast...

71
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,730
不  我要说
No, no, no!

72
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,600
幸福的夫妻需要听到这句话
The happy couple needs to hear this.

73
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,630
好花不常开  好景不长在
Things end.

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,120
就数据统计而言 你俩很可能离婚
But from the ashes of your statistically

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,470
然后形影单只  孤独终老
probable divorce,

76
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,470
但枯木终逢春
hope can rise anew.

77
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,650
因此我准备开创我自己的建筑公司
That is why I'm starting my own architecture firm--

78
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,550
莫比斯设计公司[Mosbius 法国国宝级艺术家]
Mosbius Designs.

79
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,150
莫斯比设计公司关门大吉
Mosbius Designs has failed.

80
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,850
三个月后

81
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,420
但是艾利克斯和杰西卡的爱情  提醒着我们
But Alex and Jessica's love reminds us that...

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,690
我的天
Oh, God!

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,550
尿斯比经典时刻
Classic Schmosby.

84
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,500
小粉拳把你人生的低潮期都放在网上
Whoa. Punchy posted the low points of your life online?

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,890
没那么简单
Oh, not just that.

86
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,090
莫斯比设计公司  关门大吉 *
* Mosbius Designs has failed

87
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,240
但是艾利克斯和杰西卡的爱情  提醒我们 *
* But Alex and Jessica's love reminds us that...

88
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,030
我我我我们 *
* Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha...

89
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,500
我的天
Oh, God!

90
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,430
所以现在我在所有高中旧友的心目中
So now I seem like a total train wreck

91
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,470
就是一个彻头彻尾的倒霉鬼
to all my old high school friends.

92
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,070
在芬兰还有一群见证者
And a bunch of people in Finland.

93
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,110
那个混音视频在他们那儿引起了不小的轰动
The auto-tune thing got kind of big over there.

94
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,190
所以我必须要搞定这次致辞  华丽转身
That's why I have to nail this toast.

95
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,080
泰德  无论你想在婚礼上搞定什么
Ted, you want to nail something at this wedding--

96
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,760
必须先扔掉这大部头
lose the Trapper Keeper.

97
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,320
你唯一需要带去克利夫兰的东西
The only thing you need to bring to Cleveland

98
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,780
就是这个
is this.

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,800
<i>那年秋天  我成了纽约史上</i>
<i>That fall I became</i> <i>the youngest architect</i>

100
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,790
<i>最年轻的把摩天大楼炸为平地的建筑师</i>
<i>in the history of New York</i> <i>to break ground</i> <i>on a skyscraper.</i>

101
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,440
<i>流行杂志专门为我做了个特辑</i>
<i>Which led to a glowing</i> <i>magazine feature.</i>

102
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,930
我打算把它裱起来
I planned on having it framed--

103
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,680
<i>巴尼叔叔的计划却与我背道而驰</i>
<i>Uncle Barney had</i> <i>different plans.</i>

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,130
你的致辞要这么念
Here's your toast--

105
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,550
"女士们  要签名请排队  谢绝肥妞"
"Single file, ladies. No fatties"

106
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,050
这太荒唐了
That's ridiculous.

107
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,430
是啊  你说得没错  那儿可是克利夫兰
Yeah, you're right. It's Cleveland.

108
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,340
那就"女士们  要签名请排队"
"Single file, ladies""

109
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,390
我才不要在小粉拳的婚礼上
I'm not going to Punchy's wedding

110
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,570
炫耀一本杂志
to brag about a magazine...

111
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,780
虽然封面人物是我
cover.

112
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,060
巴尼  他不需要你的约会建议
Barney, he doesn't need dating advice from you.

113
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,080
你至今还不敢给诺拉打电话呢
You never even called Nora.

114
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,730
孩子们  你们还记得诺拉吧
Kids, you remember Nora.

115
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,200
可就在前几天
But just the other day...

116
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,370
-我晚点打给你  -从来不会太晚  巴尼
- I'll call you. - It's never too late, Barney.

117
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,390
还是你已经打了
Or did you call her?

118
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,210
我才不关心呢  打了吗
Not that I care. Did you?

119
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,810
我真不关心  到底打没打
I don't care. Did you?

120
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,610
其实我还没打
I haven't called her.

121
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,320
-伙计  -该死  巴尼
- Buddy. -Damn it, Barney.

122
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,710
我可是打从心底由衷真心希望你们在一起
I was really, really, really rooting for you two.

123
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,930
谁要吃辣鸡翅
Who wants hot wings?

124
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,150
我要
I'm in.

125
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,350
要不直接往巴尼身上泼辣酱吧
Or maybe we should just pour hot sauce on Barney,

126
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,740
因为他就是只畏畏缩缩的小鸡仔[胆小鬼]
since he's a total chicken.

127
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,440
我哪有临阵退缩
I did not chicken out.

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,410
诺拉是在寻求真爱
Nora is looking for something serious.

129
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,470
而我不是  所以没戏
I'm not. End of story.

130
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,150
还有  罗宾  我想来点鸡翅
And yes, Robin, I would love some wings.

131
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,060
吃本家没良心
Cannibal.

132
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,500
好吧  下一轮我买单
Okay, next round's on me.

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,930
-不  不  我们够了  -不  不
- Oh, no, we got it. - No, no...

134
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,730
莉莉和马修刚发现
Now Lily and Marshall had just found out

135
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,240
他们有宝宝了
they were having a baby.

136
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,190
-我要马上宣布这个好消息  -宝贝  不行
- I can't wait to tell everyone. - Baby, no,

137
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,610
头三个月我们要保密
We can't tell anyone. Not until three months.

138
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,610
有种说法怀孕头三个月  肚子里的宝宝不想让别人知道  不然可能会流产

139
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,010
我可不想坏事
I don't want to jinx it.

140
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,190
你有点过于迷信了吧
That's a bit superstitious, don't you think?

141
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,150
是谁每次登机  都要舔一下飞机
Whenever we board a flight, you lick the plane.

142
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,730
那我们飞机失事过吗
Have we crashed even once?

143
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,140
总之在确保顺利前一个字都别提  好吗
Don't say a word until we know everything's okay. Deal?

144
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,290
好吧  但我知道一切都会无比顺利的
Deal. But everything's just going to be great.

145
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,290
我保证
I promise.

146
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,460
你怎么保证
How can you guarantee that?

147
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,880
过来
Come here.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,940
我开心极了  我不知道
I'm just so happy. I don't know how

149
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,100
这三个月要怎么做才能不被人发现
we're going to keep this secret for three months.

150
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,970
别紧张  瞒天过海很简单
Relax. It'll be easy.

151
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,510
你们要什么
What'll you have?

152
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,610
四杯啤酒  外加一杯不含酒精的
Four beers, plus one non-alcoholic.

153
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,960
你怀孕了  让我抱抱准妈咪
You're pregnant! Get in here!

154
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,120
然后我们就出发回我老家
And so we all headed to my hometown

155
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,790
去庆祝小粉拳的大日子
where we planned to celebrate Punchy's big day.

156
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,440
而巴尼叔叔则有其它计划
Uncle Barney had different plans.

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,820
准备好啦  克里夫兰
Get ready, Cleveland.

158
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,660
上一个像这样把你们搞得屁滚尿流
The last man to screw you this hard

159
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,830
然后消失无踪的是勒布朗・詹姆斯
then disappear was LeBron James.

160
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,830
以前在克里夫兰骑士队  后来为了总冠军去迈阿密热火队

161
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,050
你要在这儿拐妞上床
You're trying to get laid here?

162
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,650
-怎么了  -天啊  巴尼
- What? - God, Barney,

163
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,720
今晚可是泰德那个烦死人朋友
tonight is a magical night

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,890
和无印象新娘的婚礼奇妙夜
between Ted's annoying friend and what's-her-face.

165
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,090
别太放肆
Have some respect.

166
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,040
这不是单纯的拐妞上床
This isn't just getting laid.

167
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,410
这是市场调研
This is market research.

168
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,740
我的传奇胜率是百分之八十三
You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...

169
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,880
应该是百分之十七  他总是颠倒是非黑白
17-- it's always the inverse.

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
绝不是偶然的
...doesn't happen by accident.

171
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,770
我对女人们上演的每一种戏码
Every single play I run on women

172
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,300
都被一丝不苟地实践过
has been meticulously field-tested.

173
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,640
运用克里夫兰
By weeding out

174
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,590
这种小型市场检测戏码的好坏
the bad plays in smaller markets like Cleveland,

175
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,560
才能知道哪种适用于纽约
I know which ones will work in New York.

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,420
比方说
For example,

177
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,790
今晚的首场演出是
tonight marks the inaugural flight

178
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,150
刚逃出来的嗜血屠夫
of the escaped manslaughterer.

179
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,480
逃逸的嗜血屠夫销魂吧
Are escaped manslaughterers sexy?

180
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
-差远了  -逊弊了
- Not even remotely. - No. No.

181
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,190
完全正确  但只有当我亲身实践才知道真假
Exactly. We'll never know unless I try it out tonight.

182
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,460
尿斯比
Schmosby! Oh!

183
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,280
便便脸  大家好啊
Turd-faces! What's up?!

184
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,430
这戒指真咯得慌
You really feel that ring now.

185
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,910
真高兴你们都来了
So glad you all made it.

186
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,180
免费酒吧  干杯  便便脸
Open bar. Drink up, turd-faces,

187
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,050
这全入凯莉的爸爸的帐
'cause Kelly's dad's paying for all this,

188
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,240
而且他恨我入骨哦
and he hates my guts.

189
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,050
没错
It's true.

190
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,540
谁来拼酒  赶紧  来吧
Who's doing shots? Come on, let's go.

191
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,620
不了  谢谢
Oh, no, thank you.

192
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,670
你是怀孕了  还是怎么了
What are you pregnant or something?

193
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,980
不醉无归
Let's get hammered!

194
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,260
你今晚可是一人喝两人份  亲爱的
You're drinking for two tonight, baby.

195
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,700
我会为了我们的孩子而战
I will do this for the child.

196
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,270
-布朗队万岁  -布朗队万岁
- Go Browns! - Go Browns!

197
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
那是全美橄榄球联赛
In AFC regular season play,

198
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,790
如果他们说超级碗  你就要说  维京人队加油
but if they mean the Super Bowl, go Vikings.

199
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,790
布朗队属克里夫兰  维京人队属马修的家乡明尼苏达

200
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,290
爽
Yowza!

201
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,960
逃逸的嗜血屠夫  不够销魂
Escaped manslaughterers-- not sexy.

202
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,600
尽管是事后诸葛
Although in hindsight,

203
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,500
但这个想法的确考虑得不够周全
that was kind of a flawed concept.

204
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,550
下一场  零号病人[头号传染源]
Next up, patient zero.

205
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,720
莉莉  今晚我们喝个痛快
Lily, we are getting sloshed tonight.

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,390
全靠你了  亲爱的
That's all you, baby.

207
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,330
再喝我就空腹喝四杯了
I'll be four shots in with no food.

208
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,820
九个月以后  老娘的阴道要挤出
In nine months, I'll be pushing

209
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,700
一个头像南瓜这么大的埃里克森宝宝
a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby out of my hoo-ha.

210
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,950
我想这几杯小酒  老爸还是能搞定的吧
I think Papa can manage a few extra cocktails.

211
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,750
说得好
Well played.

212
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,090
真爽[非洲斯瓦西里语]
Hakuna Matata!

213
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,750
我  我得出去透透气
I, uh, I got to get some air.

214
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,020
<i>孩子们  还记得我跟你说过</i>
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

215
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,070
<i>马修把小粉拳婚礼毁了吗</i>
<i>Marshall ruined</i> <i>Punchy's wedding?</i>

216
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,140
<i>现在还没到时候</i>
<i>That wasn't it.</i>

217
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
天啊  你看看他
God, will you look at that guy.

218
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,880
真希望巴尼能跟我重修旧好
I wish Barney were my boyfriend again.

219
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,210
还是算了吧
No, thanks.

220
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,650
等下  这是你说真话的腔调
Wait a minute. That's your truth voice.

221
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
我的什么
My what?

222
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,270
每次你想用笑话来掩盖真话
Whenever you're trying to pass something off as a joke

223
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,620
一笑而过时  就会用这种腔调
but it's actually profoundly true, you use that voice.

224
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,510
我真希望辣妹组合能复合
I wish the Spice Girls would get back together.

225
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,140
她们超赞的
They were awesome.

226
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,940
糟透了
The worst.

227
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,270
是我放的
That was me.

228
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,750
我完全没忍住
I totally cut one.

229
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,760
那个男的真差劲
That guy.

230
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,340
我爸寄来的生日礼物
Birthday present from my dad.

231
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,590
我真正想要的其实是
All I really want is for him

232
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,410
一句他爱我
to tell me that he loves me.

233
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,680
开玩笑的啦
Just kidding.

234
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,020
有这支笔就够了
This pen's enough.

235
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,800
不够不够
It's not enough.

236
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,970
完全够了
It's totally enough.

237
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,910
我的上帝啊
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,360
你对巴尼余情未了
You still have feelings for Barney.

239
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,440
承认吧  你对他余情未了
Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney.

240
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,370
你比我想象的更醉哎
You are drunker than I thought.

241
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,560
-你看他那傻样  -等下等下
- I mean,look at the guy. - Wait, wait, wait.

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,210
在你走之前  请完成以下调查
Before you go, please answer the following survey

243
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,660
好让我今后把到你的机率能更大点
to help me better bang you in the future.

244
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,430
为什么这次的戏码你不买账
What didn't work for you about this play?

245
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,940
A  你不相信
Did you A) not believe

246
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,690
我是吉尼斯世界纪录的保持者
I was a <i>Guinness Book</i> world record holder?

247
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,930
还是 B 这些指甲恶心到你了
or B) did the fingernails gross you out?

248
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,610
我好期待你的祝词啊  尿斯比
I can't wait for your toast, Schmosby.

249
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,060
是啊  水龙头要关不住啦
Yeah, here come the waterworks.

250
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,700
等下  你赞成我在你的婚礼崩溃大哭吗
Wait. You're rooting for me to melt down at your own wedding?

251
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,090
对  大家都翘首期盼呢
Yeah, everyone is.

252
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,470
还有一些芬兰来的新朋友
Plus a few new friends from Finland.

253
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,960
祝你好运  尿斯比
Hey, good luck, Schmos.

254
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,890
祝你好运  祝你好运
Good luck, good luck.

255
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,930
快拿着
Take it.

256
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,180
让他们知道你有多厉害
Show them how awesome you are.

257
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,850
要厚着脸皮宣传自己  一分耕耘
Shamelessly plug yourself, so you can shamelessly plug,

258
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,970
-一分收获  -我都说了
- let's say that. - I told you,

259
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,090
我不是来这儿炫耀的  好吧
I'm not here to brag, okay?

260
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,030
够了
That's it.

261
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,110
你太谦虚了
You're too polite to brag.

262
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,860
好吧
Well, fine.

263
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,400
让我来
Let me.

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,730
因为这世上只有一个人马修・埃里克森
Because the only person on Earth

265
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,990
比马修・埃里克森更爱泰德・莫斯比
who loves Ted Mosby more than Marshall Eriksen,

266
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,440
那就是喝醉的马修・埃里克森
is drunk Marshall Eriksen.

267
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,190
好戏上场
So game on.

268
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,650
<i>孩子们  还记得我跟你们讲过</i>
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

269
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,180
<i>马修毁了小粉拳和凯利的婚礼吗</i>
<i>Marshall ruined Punchy</i> <i>and Kelly's wedding?</i>

270
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,790
<i>现在也还没到那个时候</i>
<i>That wasn't it either.</i>

271
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,970
我和巴尼努力过了  但还是分手告终
Barney and I tried and failed.

272
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,290
都过去两年了
That was two years ago.

273
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,460
我为什么还要重蹈覆辙
Why would I ever go down that road again?

274
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,900
这完全不合理
It wouldn't even make sense.

275
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,710
不是凡事都要求合理的  感觉是很奇妙的
It doesn't have to make sense. It's chemistry.

276
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,270
我的第六感向来对这种事很敏锐
Look, I've always had a sixth sense about these things.

277
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,150
再加上现在我怀孕了
And now that I'm pregnant...

278
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,990
我以大脑为子宫  孕育这个想法
with this idea in my mind-uterus,

279
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,910
我现在看得更清楚了
I see things even clearer.

280
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,240
巴尼和你对彼此的感觉
You and Barney have the kind of chemistry

281
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,880
-都没有消失殆尽  -真的吗
- that just doesn't go away.- Really?

282
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,450
那他为什么想要鼓捣所有会动的东西呢
Then why is he trying to LeBron anything that moves?

283
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,670
你不买账是因为
Did this not work for you

284
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,790
A  吸血鬼这招被人玩烂了
because A) vampires are played out,

285
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,260
或是B  同时宣称我还是FACEBOOK的创始人
or B) claiming that I also invented Facebook

286
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,410
这个谎有点扯太大了
was kind of a hat on a hat?

287
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,160
他是因为你  才没有给诺拉打电话
You're the reason he never called Nora.

288
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,500
也是因为你  他今晚才只有在这做市场调查
You're the reason he's only test-marketing tonight.

289
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,060
更是因为你  他总是故意把其他女人三振出局
And you're the reason he keeps striking out on purpose.

290
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,890
这就是爱情
Chemistry.

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,890
哇  泰德
Whoa! Ted!

292
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,680
《纽约》杂志封面上的人真是你吗
Is that really you on the cover of <i>New York</i> magazine?

293
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,200
你要说  是啊
Now, you say "yes""

294
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
-快别说了  -尿斯比
- Please stop. - Schmosby.

295
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,370
这个杂志讲的什么
What's this about a magazine?

296
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,320
没什么大不了的  克雷
You know what, Clay? It's no big deal.

297
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,460
我告诉你  这可是件大事啊
You know what? It is a big deal.

298
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,240
克雷  我朋友泰德正在设计一幢摩天大楼
Clay, my friend Ted is designing a skyscraper, Clay.

299
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,880
你最近都在干嘛呢  克雷
What have you been up to, Clay?

300
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,380
我还在汽车租凭公司上班
Well, I'm still working at the rental car company...

301
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,000
不错不错
Bravo, bravo, Clay.

302
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
有没有出版社想写一篇
Any major publications want to write an article

303
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,060
关于你汽车租凭公司的文章啊
on your sweet rental car gig?

304
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,510
没有
No, no articles.

305
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,510
我的生活很沉闷
My life's pretty dull.

306
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,710
我最近唯一的新闻是这个小家伙
I guess the only news is this little gal.

307
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,100
老天爷啊  快看这个小宝贝
Oh, my God, wook at the wittle baby.

308
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,850
她太可爱了
She is so cute.

309
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,720
我好想把她的小脚
All I want to do is put her little feet

310
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,390
放进我的嘴巴里
in my mouth.

311
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,560
你创造了这么一个可人儿
You've created something truly beautiful.

312
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,580
她是我的全部
She is my everything.

313
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,400
我觉得这也算见大事吧
I mean, it's kind of a big deal...

314
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,730
摩天大楼耶  对吧
the building, you know?

315
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,230
小家伙
Hey, little one.

316
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,900
这位小天使晚上不哭闹  都能一觉睡到天亮啦
So, this little angel's already sleeping through the night?

317
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,790
我设计这幢大楼时
I've had some sleepless nights...

318
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,670
试过彻夜未眠
designing this building.

319
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,660
这无任何象征意义
Nothing symbolic about that.

320
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,450
算了吧
Let it go.

321
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,030
我和巴尼对彼此没有任何感觉
There is no chemistry left between me and Barney.

322
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,150
我们早结束了
We're done.

323
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,640
真的吗  证明给我看  去告诉他
Oh really? Prove it. Go tell him.

324
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,450
我为什么要去告诉他这个
Why would I go tell him that?

325
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,960
即便现在巴尼还没有意识到  但在内心深处
Because deep down, even if he isn't aware of it himself,

326
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,110
他是想和你在一起的
Barney wants to be with you.

327
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,550
如果你们不可能
And if it's not gonna happen,

328
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,160
他理应知道结果
he deserves to know.

329
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,480
好吧
Fine.

330
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,240
巴尼  一切都显而易见
Barney, just so everything is crystal clear...

331
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,790
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

332
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,790
我们要用行动  秀给克利夫兰看
Let's show Cleveland how it's done.

333
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,630
Deee Lite 《Groove is in the heart》

334
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,630
你溅落在我背上的冰水 *
* The chills that you spill up my back

335
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,250
让我心满意足 *
* Leave me filled with satisfaction

336
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,080
我们结束后  结果甚为满意 *
* When we're done, satisfaction of what's to come

337
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,240
我别无他求 *
* I couldn't ask for another

338
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,350
现在的我  别无他求 *
* Now I couldn't ask for another

339
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,600
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

340
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,110
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

341
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,280
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

342
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,150
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

343
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,510
一  二  三
One, two, three

344
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,420
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in your heart

345
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,020
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

346
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,110
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

347
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,860
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

348
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,400
心花怒放 *
* Groove is in the heart

349
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,330
巴尼...  我...
Barney... I...

350
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,750
抱歉
Sorry.

351
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,190
我的天  是诺拉
Oh, my God, it's Nora.

352
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,940
诺拉终于回我电话了
Nora's finally calling me back.

353
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,360
等等  你说你没打给她
Wait, you said you never called her.

354
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,580
我撒谎了  我打了  大概五次吧
I lied. I called her, like, five times.

355
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,160
等等
Wait, wait!

356
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,210
我超不会处理这种状况  这点你是最清楚的了
You of all people know how much I suck at these things.

357
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,000
你一定要帮我  求你了
You gotta help me. Please?

358
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
这是我第一次
Just once I would like

359
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,030
想认真做好一件事
to see what it feels like to not screw things up.

360
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
好吧
Yeah, mm-hmm.

361
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,860
好的
Okay.

362
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,490
诺拉  谢谢你回我电话
Hey, Nora. Thanks for calling me back.

363
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,860
你好  那个  我打给你
Um, hey, hi. The-the-the reason that, um,

364
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,360
是为了...
I called is, uh...

365
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,130
告诉你我对你的感觉
To tell you how I feel about you.

366
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,330
告诉你我对你的感觉
...to tell you how I feel about you.

367
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,970
虽然第一次我们以分手告终
I know we didn't work out the first time...

368
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,800
虽然第一次我们以分手告终
I know we didn't work out the first time...

369
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,440
而我知道那并不能说明什么
...and I know it doesn't make any sense...

370
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,220
而我知道那并不能说明什么
...and I know it doesn't make any sense...

371
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,730
但我们是属于彼此的  这个想法在我心中挥之不去
...but I can't shake the feeling that we belong together.

372
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,140
但我们是属于彼此的
...but I can't shake this feeling

373
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,230
这个想法在我心中挥之不去
that we belong together.

374
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,980
你是否愿意再给我一次机会
Is there any part of you that wants to try again?

375
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,520
你是否愿意再给我一次机会
Is there any part of you that wants to try again?

376
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,480
亲爱的  我憋不住了
Baby, I can't take it anymore.

377
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,230
我好想告诉大家你怀孕了
I've gotta tell somebody that we're pregnant.

378
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,500
埃里克森  坚持住
Eriksen, stay strong.

379
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,080
我们要死守这个秘密
We're keeping this secret.

380
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,580
到处都是孩子
There's babies everywhere.

381
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,170
处处充满着童趣
It's like a minefield of cuteness.

382
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,670
看看这个小混蛋
Look at this little bastard.

383
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,010
马修  停  坚持住
Marshall, stop it. Stay strong.

384
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,410
你不能这样抱小宝宝
You can't let holding some, some little baby...

385
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,510
看他可爱的的小嫩颊
oh, with the cute little cheeks

386
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,680
他的小藕臂
and the... the little arms

387
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,220
还有小粉腿
and little legs...

388
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,270
这个小混蛋还有膝盖窝
This son of a bitch has knee dimples.

389
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,940
快向众人宣布我怀孕了
Let's go tell everyone I'm pregnant.

390
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,390
好
Yeah!

391
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,540
你没事吧
You okay?

392
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,830
没事  你呢
Nope. You?

393
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,800
不太好
Not excessively.

394
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,930
要聊聊吗
You want to talk about it?

395
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,420
打死也不说
Not even a little.

396
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,550
说出来可能会好受些
Might make you feel better.

397
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,840
好的  这样吧
Okay, fine, I'll make you a deal:

398
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,440
你先说  而我
you go first,and then

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,840
则坚持打死也不说
I'll stick with my thing about not talking about it.

400
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,900
好的
Okay.

401
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,060
我的高中同学
All my friends from high school,

402
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,870
都有了美妻娇儿
they're here with their wives, their kids.

403
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,600
我呢  整晚只有奶乎乎的杂志作伴
Me? My date for the night is a sticky magazine.

404
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
听起来像是高中再现
Sounds like high school all over again.

405
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,990
抱歉  对着杂志打飞机脏的也是那块儿
Sorry, it was right there.

406
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,660
曾经的我相信命运
I used to believe in destiny, you know?

407
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,580
我去买百吉饼  见到一位漂亮女生在排队
I'd go to the bagel place, see a pretty girl in line

408
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,550
她看着我最爱的小说  哼着一首
reading my favorite novel, whistling the song

409
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,770
在我脑中萦绕一周挥之不去的小曲  我会想
that's been stuck in my head all week and I'd think,

410
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,260
老天  没准她就是我的真命天女
"Wow. Hey, maybe she's the one."

411
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,960
而现在的我则想  我就知道那个贱人
Now I think, "I just know that bitch is gonna take

412
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,780
会买走所有剩下的全麦百吉饼
the last whole-wheat everything bagel."

413
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,020
你只是太专心工作了
You've just been focused on work.

414
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,070
不  比这还糟
No, it's more than that.

415
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,470
我心中的信念之火已灭
I've stopped believing.

416
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,690
不是以那种极度消沉
Not in some depressed,

417
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,660
在致辞时大哭一场的方式
"I'm gonna cry during my toast" Way.

418
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,060
而是潜移默化的  直到我今晚才真正意识到
Not in a way I even noticed until tonight.

419
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,150
日复一日  我心中的信念之火越来越暗
It's just, every day, I think I believe a little less

420
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,490
火光微乎其微  最终暗淡无光
and a little less and a little less.

421
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,770
这感觉  好糟糕
And that... sucks.

422
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,630
我该怎么办  特布罗斯基
What do I do about that, Scherbatsky?

423
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,330
你是泰德・莫斯比
You're Ted Mosby.

424
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,350
你会重燃信念之火
You start believing again.

425
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,140
信什么  命运吗
In what, destiny?

426
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,060
感觉
Chemistry.

427
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,310
有了感觉  再加一样就大功告成
If you have chemistry, you only need one other thing.

428
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,530
是什么
What's that?

429
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,010
机缘
Timing.

430
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,680
可惜机缘可遇不可求
But timing's a bitch.

431
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,620
我们的四十之约还有效吗
Hey, we still have our 40 deal, right?

432
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,160
如果我们四十时都还单身...
If we're both still single at 40...

433
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,020
我绝对嫁给你
I'm all yours. Hmm

434
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,080
随便问问  建筑师能赚大钱吗
Unrelated, do architects make big money?

435
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,860
来势汹汹的都不是大钱
Aggressively medium money.

436
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,120
亏了
Damn it.

437
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
尿斯比  两分钟后上场
Schmosby, you're up in two minutes.

438
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,550
答应我两件事
Okay, promise me two things,

439
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,610
第一  重燃信念之火
One, you start believing again,

440
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,610
第二  不准在致辞时哭  尿斯比
And two, don't cry during the toast, Schmosby.

441
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,050
我保证
I promise.

442
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,210
很好
Good.

443
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,740
我怀孕了
We're having a baby.

444
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,400
真的吗
What, for real?

445
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,520
真的
For real.

446
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,230
各位请注意
Attention, everyone!

447
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,080
我们今晚齐聚一堂  就是为了此刻
It's time for the reason we're all here tonight.

448

欢迎尿斯比致辞

今晚我们欢聚  是为了歌颂爱情

450

爱情为我们带来新的生命

451
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,930
你们

452
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,780
这不是情绪崩溃
This isn't a meltdown.

453
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,630
这是喜极而泣
These are tears of joy.

454
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,090
泰德为他的朋友们开心

455
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,140
他是我认识的最好的人

456
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,440
知道他为什么开心吗
And do you know why he's happy?

457
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,260
因为这位天仙怀孕了
Because this beautiful lady right here is pregnant.

458
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,700
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?!

459
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,900
这是个秘密
That was supposed to be a secret!

460
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,000
原来
Turns out...

461
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,950
布朗队万岁
Go Browns!

462
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,320
布朗队万岁
Go Browns! Whoo!

463
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,770
那是全美橄榄球联赛
In AFC regular season play,

464
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,790
如果他们说超级碗  你就要说  维京人队万岁
but if they mean the Super Bowl, go Vikings.

465
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,440
你真是色胆包天
How dare you.

466
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,800
你居然让她带球结婚  你这个人渣
That's my daughter, you piece of garbage.

467
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,760
您老还愿意为婚礼买单不
You're still gonna pay for all this, right?

468
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,670
你居然叫我儿子"人渣"
"Piece of garbage"? That's my son.

469
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,800
马修就是这样毁了小粉拳的婚礼
And that is how Marshall destroyed Punchy's wedding.

470
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,460
可我们不在乎
But we didn't care.

471
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,510
因为我们的小家庭要迎来第六位成员了
There was gonna be a sixth member of our little family.

472
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,770
再也不会有婚礼那么糟糕了  是吧
No wedding will ever, ever be as bad as that one, right?

473
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,320
我选择了正确的领带  对吗
I picked the right tie, didn't I?

474
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,720
太正确了
You nailed it.

475
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,840
总之不要是小鸭领带就行
And hey, just be glad it's not the ducky tie.

476
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,260
小鸭领带
Ooh, the ducky tie.

477
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,460
这可是个好故事  我会讲到的
That's a good story kids. I'll get to that.

478
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,200
老天爷  咱离大结局还早着呢
Man, we are not even close to the end.

479
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,050
你是个很棒的伴郎  泰德
You're a good best man, Ted.

480
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,090
婚礼念祝词时你会哭的  是吧
You're gonna cry during the toast, aren't you?

481
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,190
一定哭得稀里哗拉
Oh, I'm totally gonna cry.

482
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,880
进来
Come in.

483
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,380
泰德  新娘要见你
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

484
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,600
好的
Okay.

485
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,400
不是吧  你就戴这条领带吗
Really? You're gonna go with that tie?
