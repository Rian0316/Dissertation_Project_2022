1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,590
<i>My siblings and I are the first
vampires in history, The Originals.</i>

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,960
<i>300 years ago, we helped
build New Orleans.</i>

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,640
<i>In our absence, a
new king arose.</i>

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,980
<i>Now I've returned and taken
his kingdom as my own.</i>

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,370
<i>I had hoped this would
bring our family together.</i>

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,410
<i>I was wrong.</i>

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,880
I wanted our home back, so
I'm going to live there,

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,300
and the two of you,

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,040
you can stay here
together and rot.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,870
You're coming with
me, little wolf.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,410
Why would I go
anywhere with you?

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,740
Now you can fight me on
this, but you will lose,

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,210
As will anyone else who tries to
stop you getting in this car.

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,330
Let us begin with a toast

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,230
to our shared gift-- 
immortality.

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>After 1,000 years,</i>

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,190
<i>one might expect for life
to be less keenly felt,</i>

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,210
for its beauties and its
sorrows to diminish with time,

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,960
but as vampires,

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,630
we feel more deeply than humans
could possibly imagine--

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,840
insatiable need,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,380
exquisite pain,

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>Our victories,</i>

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,890
and our defeats.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,150
You can't afford
your wounded pride.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,530
With Klaus in control
of your empire,

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,710
You need to give him
what he craves most--

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,730
Loyalty, or at least
the illusion of it.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,390
I ambushed him, 
tried to bury him alive.

30
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,920
He's not gonna trust me.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,420
He will because he
wants your allegiance.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,860
Speaking from experience,

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,140
I know that if you play the
part, all is forgiven,

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,120
but if you give him any
reason to doubt you,

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,760
<i>He will strike back.</i>

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,000
Make me a promise, Marcel.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,750
You do whatever it
takes to stay alive.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,360
To my city, my home again.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,540
May the blood never cease to flow.

40
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,530
And the party never end.

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,820
I just don't get it, man.

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,860
You know we would've stood
with you till the end.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,170
Letting you do that would've
been letting you die,

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,880
and you're still my people.

45
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,860
For now, just follow my lead.

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,040
Trust me, it ain't over yet.

47
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,790
To New Orleans.

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,970
- To New Orleans.
- New Orleans.

49
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,790
I understand that some of
you may have questions

50
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,440
regarding the recent
change in leadership,

51
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,540
and I invited you here
tonight to assure you

52
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,270
that you are not defeated.

53
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,700
No. My intentions moving forward
are to celebrate what we have,

54
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,080
What Marcel, in fact, took...

55
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,510
and built into this--

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,450
a true community of vampires.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,160
What about her, the wolf?

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,450
Had you let me finish, Diego,

59
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,710
you would know that
there is, of course,

60
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,500
one further matter I
would like to address.

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,380
As many of you know,

62
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,300
the girl is carrying my child.

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,320
<i>Consequently, I trust</i>

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,500
you will all pay her the
appropriate respect.

65
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,430
However, I understand that
some of you are concerned

66
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,750
by this vicious rumor that I intend
to use the blood of our child

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,420
to create hybrids.

68
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,190
I assure you, I do not.

69
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,810
Father of the year.

70
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,160
It appears I will have
to earn your trust.

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,490
Very well.

72
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,830
We'll eliminate the
root of your anxiety.

73
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,310
You see, how can I
sire any hybrids

74
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,730
if there are no more werewolves
alive in the Bayou to turn?

75
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,880
What? 
Klaus, no.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,710
So eat, drink, and be merry,

77
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,480
and tomorrow I suggest you have

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,550
yourselves a little wolf hunt.

79
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,420
Go ahead. Have fun.
Kill them all.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,950
<i>Absolutely not.</i> 
I paid for that.

82
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,600
Please. Never paid for
anything in your life.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
I hardly see how
that's relevant.

84
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,400
Nik's just punishing us.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,200
Well, we've hurt him,
deeply, it would appear.

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,990
We believed the worst
about him the one time

87
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,570
in a million when the worst
wasn't actually the truth.

88
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,350
Where do you think you're going?

89
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,580
To ensure that Hayley doesn't
suffer for our mistakes.

90
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,820
Niklaus is feeling vindictive.

91
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,840
We cannot trust
that she is safe.

92
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>And so then I bit Elijah</i>

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,150
<i>and left him in the bayou</i>

94
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,780
with my hybrid venom
in his veins.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Serves him right for making such
vile accusations against me,

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,580
and let--

97
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,670
Are you taking this down?

98
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,520
To be clear, if the
quarter is yours now,

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
you still need me why?

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,490
My memoirs.

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,310
1,000 years of history
isn't gonna write itself.

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,710
Cami, what are you doing here?

103
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,070
My question exactly.

104
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,950
Oh, it's quite all right.
She knows.

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,340
She does?

106
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,590
That you're vampires?
Don't worry.

107
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,210
He's compelled me to forget
everything as soon as I leave.

108
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,830
That way, I'm too
busy agonizing over

109
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,680
whether or not I'm
losing my damn mind

110
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,290
to realize I'm playing spy
for an immortal egomaniac.

111
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,440
You compelled her to go
out with me, didn't you?

112
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,560
And I thought you
really liked me.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,370
So did I.

114
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,710
Well, I mean, to be clear,

115
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,370
I only compelled you
to give him a chance.

116
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,830
Anything you felt for
him was quite real.

117
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,940
<i>And, for the record,</i>

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,230
the level of awkwardness

119
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,800
We're all currently experiencing
is entirely genuine.

120
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,670
You think you're so
clever, don't you,

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,240
compelling the poor,
naive bartender?

122
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,430
Look what I found,

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,370
real me, not your
compelled therapist.

124
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,440
Well, actually I prefer
devoted stenographer.

125
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,600
You think this is funny,
messing with my mind?

126
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,030
My sanity is not a joke.

127
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,490
No, Luv, I don't believe it is.

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
You never found this.

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,550
You will remember
nothing of our life

130
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,940
as vampires when you leave here.

131
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,190
Do you understand?

132
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,370
I think that just about
does it for the day.

133
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,670
You may go.

134
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,590
Going somewhere?

135
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,720
Elijah.
You shouldn't be here.

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,490
Klaus has his guys watching me.

137
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,150
I wouldn't worry about them.

138
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,890
Come. We mustn't linger.

139
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,810
Let's get you someplace safe.

140
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,190
No. You don't have to worry about me.
I'm fine.

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,740
I've been deemed under protection
by the almighty Klaus.

142
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,820
It's the werewolves
who need help.

143
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,870
He ordered a wolf hunt as some

144
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,710
jacked-up peace offering
to Marcel's crew.

145
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,850
You have to help them.

146
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,310
Out in the Bayou?

147
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,030
Do we look like a bloody
vampire rescue squad?

148
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,350
I think you should be
grateful we came to save you.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,500
Listen, Rebekah.

150
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,820
All my life, I've wanted to
know who my real family was,

151
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,640
and just as I find out that
they're out there in the bayou,

152
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,380
Klaus orders them killed.

153
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,240
You want to help me?

154
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,220
Help my people, please.

155
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,770
Humans have called a meeting.

156
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,210
They're not exactly thrilled
with the new status quo.

157
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,020
How unfortunate for them.

158
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,500
Look. It's your show now,

159
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
but you want to know how
I built what I built?

160
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,150
Politics.

161
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,760
A little diplomacy
goes a long way,

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,090
especially with the
human faction.

163
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,260
Duly noted.

164
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,670
I haven't thought about
this night in ages--

165
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,460
<i>1919, the opera house
just before it burned.</i>

166
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,270
This was the end of an era.

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,510
Now, in the interest
of new beginnings,

168
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,420
I feel there are some things I
should probably confess to you,

169
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,640
but where to begin?

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,550
Thierry was never
disloyal to you.

171
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,760
I set him up in an attempt
to locate my brother.

172
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,670
He's your friend,
and, consequently,

173
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,120
he can return to the compound 
at your discretion.

174
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,870
Cami's part you just learned,

175
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,810
and then there's young Joshua.

176
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,280
I've been compelling him
from the beginning,

177
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,990
although I suspect you
already knew that,

178
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,580
as he was the one who
led me into your trap.

179
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,030
I may have fed the kid
some misinformation.

180
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,170
Mm, and then there's Davina.

181
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,770
She's a powerful weapon.

182
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,220
At this point, I'd like to
keep her close at hand.

183
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,580
I think we should have her move

184
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,820
into the compound here with us.

185
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,380
Eh, she can't leave the attic.

186
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,150
I already tried
to move her once.

187
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,350
Yes. About that, turns out,

188
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,690
your little witch is
quite the actress.

189
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,070
She made a deal with Elijah
while he was in captivity,

190
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,660
tricked you into
letting her stay put

191
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,690
in exchange for some spells
from our mother's grimoire.

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,100
Good to know. Is that all?

193
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,140
I do believe it is.

194
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,670
Appreciate the honesty.

195
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,330
Meeting is in an hour.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
--- BELIEVE NOTHING KLAUS TELLS YOU ---

197
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,825
--- YOUR BAG INSIDE POCKET ---

198
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,870
<i>And so then I bit Elijah
and left him in the bayou</i>

199
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,450
<i>with my hybrid venom
in his veins.</i>

200
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,200
<i>Serves him right for making such
vile accusations against me.</i>

201
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,570
You're gonna love
it at the compound.

202
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,760
I already got the best room
in the place picked out.

203
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,100
I can't leave.

204
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,800
Remember what
happened last time?

205
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,100
I know about your
deal with Elijah.

206
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,000
Can't be lying to each other.

207
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,950
I'm trying to protect you.

208
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,670
With the witches still looking
to kill you for the harvest,

209
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,430
believe me, you're
safest with us.

210
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,440
Plus, there's excellent
light in the afternoon.

211
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,970
I see you're an artist.

212
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,800
Wonderful.

213
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,610
I look forward to witnessing
your many talents.

214
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,790
Was this his idea?

215
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,160
Davina, please.

216
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,350
I understand you're
devoted to Marcel,

217
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,720
but Marcel is devoted to me.

218
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
I assume you want what's
best for all of us.

219
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,650
We have a meeting to
attend downstairs.

220
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,950
Look. I'll get someone
to pick up your things.

221
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,700
We'll get you settled in right.

222
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,800
Trust me.

223
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,460
Klaus, Marcel, 
Thank you for coming.

224
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Now, we are aware of the change
in leadership in your community,

225
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,300
and we thought it was time to make
the appropriate introductions.

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,830
We want to be sure you understand
how things work around here.

227
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,440
Is that so?

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,180
What the mayor means
is that we just want

229
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,750
some assurance that
this new development

230
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,360
isn't gonna endanger our
city or its inhabitants.

231
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,020
Look. You freaks do your thing,

232
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,650
and we'll look the other way.

233
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,290
As long as our
pockets stay full,

234
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,100
we won't have a problem.

235
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,800
More importantly,
there are rules.

236
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,740
No feeding on the locals.

237
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,740
Don't bring any unwanted
attention to the city.

238
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,720
Now, history has proven that
we can coexist peacefully.

239
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,120
However, if you cross the line--

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
You answer to us.

241
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,150
Ha ha! Ok. I'm sorry. 
Let me get this straight.

242
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,590
I'm to play supplicant
to this pompous ass

243
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,530
and his ridiculous group
of petty thieves?

244
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,010
Ah, Here are my terms.

245
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,130
You will take whatever scraps
I see fit to leave you,

246
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,020
and you will be grateful.

247
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,040
If that doesn't suit you,

248
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,850
I may decide you've
outlived your usefulness.

249
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,850
Hey, 
They were obviously just here.

250
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,940
Fan out, find them, and
bring me some heads.

251
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,830
I'd rather you didn't.

252
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,380
What the hell are
you doing out here?

253
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,830
I've come to suggest you
seek other hunting grounds.

254
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
Suggestion noted.

255
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,130
Well, Diego, it would
be such a shame

256
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,560
to have to rearrange
that pretty face.

257
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,850
What the hell you
care about wolves?

258
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,260
Generally, I don't.

259
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,810
However this particular
clan is not to be touched.

260
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,030
Good-bye.

261
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,860
Bye.

262
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,500
Nothing here, anyway.

263
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,830
Great. I guess our
job here is done.

264
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,100
Not quite.

265
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,690
We're not here to harm you.

266
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,150
Hello again.
Eve, was it?

267
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,180
One of Hayley's little
mate, I presume.

268
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,000
Hayley sent you here to
protect us, didn't she?

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,420
Tell her we appreciate
the concern,

270
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,070
but we've been looking out for
ourselves for a while now.

271
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,220
Nobody finds us

272
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,850
unless we want to be found.

273
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,550
Well, we found you, so...

274
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,070
Like I said...

275
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,560
There's something I thought you and
your family should know about.

276
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,080
I think I was far more
gracious than they deserved.

277
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
You're disappointed by
my lack of diplomacy.

278
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,010
Well, you, above all people,
should need no reminder

279
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,380
of the human capacity
for cruelty.

280
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,600
Hello?

281
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
Mr. Mikaelson,

282
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,840
just wanted to let you know,

283
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,040
the faction has
considered your terms.

284
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,810
We've reached a decision.

285
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,030
Have you?

286
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,890
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

287
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,160
Oh, this is on you.

288
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Now that you're in charge,

289
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,080
those are your guys laying dead,

290
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,590
Your guys.

291
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,790
You're gonna run this city, that
better mean something to you.

292
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,110
Otherwise no one worth a damn
is gonna follow you, no one.

293
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,450
I was beginning to
worry about you.

294
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,490
I don't think I could've taken

295
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,210
any more of this
deferential nonsense.

296
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,030
I mean, clearly, I
underestimated the faction.

297
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,040
That won't happen
again, but tell me,

298
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,460
now that we've arrived
at this point,

299
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,150
now that they have
come into our home,

300
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,800
visited this upon our people,

301
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,900
how would you counsel
me to respond?

302
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,340
Let's go kill them all.

303
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,910
We're surrounded by
20,000 acres of swamp.

304
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,270
The ones born here know it
like the backs of our hands.

305
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,710
We'll be fine, but here,

306
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,570
newcomers from out of state,

307
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,240
not Hayley's and mine kin,

308
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,010
but word spread about
that baby of hers.

309
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,230
Lot of werewolves want to see

310
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,430
this miracle pregnancy
for themselves.

311
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,430
Only now the vampires are
out looking for blood,

312
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,350
and all these werewolves
new to the bayou,

313
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,140
they might not know
where to hide.

314
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,230
You say that like we're
supposed to care.

315
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,200
Believe me, you're gonna
want then kept alive.

316
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,610
And why is that?

317
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,580
See for yourself.

318
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,330
<i>I know you're in here, Josh.</i>

319
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,440
I can sense your fear.

320
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,500
I heard you were moving in.

321
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,280
What are you doing in here?

322
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,060
Uh, you know,
I'm hiding out,

323
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,810
You know, incognito.

324
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,730
Got to run for the hills,

325
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,320
but I'm stuck here
until it gets dark.

326
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,140
Are you ok?

327
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Yeah. Yeah.

328
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,450
No, not really.

329
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,590
I mean, I totally led
Klaus into a trap

330
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,430
that was like the most
epic failure of all time.

331
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,930
So, yeah, I'm kind of
crapping my pants right now,

332
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,610
Figuratively... so far.

333
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,570
It's OK.

334
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,100
You can trust Marcel,

335
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,310
and if Klaus tries to hurt you,

336
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,240
I'll hurt him.

337
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm sure if you could
actually stop Klaus,

338
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,120
you would've done it already.

339
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,390
You're Hayley, Klaus' wife.

340
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,080
Ew. 
No. Never.

341
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,270
I'm the pregnant werewolf,

342
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,160
and you must be the all-powerful

343
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,470
super witch Davina, and
let's not forget Josh,

344
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,610
newbie vampire way
out of his element,

345
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,490
voted most likely to die next.

346
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,950
Oh, fantastic.

347
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,770
Hey, I'm just another one
of Klaus' prisoners.

348
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,600
Of course, it would
suck if he found out

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,580
you were still lurking around.

350
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,440
Maybe there's a world

351
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,610
where we can all look
out for each other.

352
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,100
I called you hours ago!

353
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,820
I-I came as fast as I could.

354
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
What's going on?

355
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,020
Your voicemail sounded...

356
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,380
What, paranoid, unhinged?

357
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,490
Upset.

358
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,780
That picture I found,

359
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,610
the one that was, I don't know,

360
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,030
a hundred years old,

361
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,420
you said it was
just a coincidence,

362
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,680
but...

363
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,760
<i>My sanity is not a joke.</i>

364
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,130
<i>No, love, I don't believe it is.</i>

365
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,440
That's my voice, but
I don't remember it.

366
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,830
I think it's... 
I think it's...

367
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,950
some kind of mind control.

368
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,810
I think he's erasing my memory!

369
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,200
Yes?

370
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,830
They what?

371
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,870
Um, we will talk
about this later.

372
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,650
Why wasn't I consulted on this?

373
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,910
You've been gone for
over 8 month, Kieran.

374
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,060
We got used to doing
things on our own.

375
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,040
This Klaus Mikaelson,

376
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,130
I don't care who he is
or what the rumors say.

377
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,770
He needed to be taught a lesson.

378
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,650
You are gonna start a war.

379
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,340
I'd like to see them try,

380
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, and, Kieran,

381
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,480
this is the last time
you call a meeting.

382
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,280
Next time you want to criticize our
leadership, send a damn e-mail.

383
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,630
I thought you called
this meeting.

384
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,010
The hell we did.

385
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,110
Actually, I called it.

386
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,130
It appears I made a grave error

387
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,220
during our earlier conference.

388
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,170
My friend Marcel offered
me wise counsel,

389
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,120
and I failed to heed it.

390
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,650
Hmm, well, I'm glad to hear
you've learned your lesson.

391
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,250
Oh, I won't be making
that mistake again.

392
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
Marcel?

393
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,220
Shall we?

394
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,730
After you.

395
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,910
There he is, 
our lone survivor.

396
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,670
Such a sad day for our city,

397
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,170
some of its best and brightest

398
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,690
killed in a tragic boating
accident on the Mississippi.

399
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,350
Rather nasty explosion, I heard.

400
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,270
What am I going to do with you?

401
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,930
OK.
Hold up.

402
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,350
I've known Kieran
for a long time.

403
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,470
He's smart, and he's fair.

404
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,060
He can do us more
good alive than dead,

405
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,350
not to mention
he's Cami's uncle.

406
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,770
Don't see you care about much.

407
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,500
It's kind of hard not
to notice when you do.

408
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,620
Very well.

409
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,610
Use this reprieve to
remake your human faction.

410
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,090
And how do you expect
me to <i>remake</i> the mayor?

411
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,380
Well, surely, there's
a deputy mayor.

412
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,410
Choose new leaders

413
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,970
then we reopen negotiations.

414
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,470
Wow, these wolves really
travel in style, don't they?

415
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,720
- Empty. 
- Behind on their payments, perhaps.

416
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,470
Shall we proceed then?

417
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,420
Let's not and tell
Hayley that we did.

418
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,630
Then you get to impress the
girl, and I can go home.

419
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,750
You know how hovels depress me.

420
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,870
I'm not trying to
impress the girl.

421
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,030
I should bloody hope you are.

422
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,570
Why else are we out here?

423
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,380
Come on, Elijah.

424
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,740
You've fallen for her.
Admit it.

425
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,390
May do wonders for the stick

426
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,780
that's lodged up your enduringly
stoic ass if you did.

427
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,680
If I admit to you that
it's complicated,

428
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,630
would that suffice,
or are you determined

429
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,780
to torment me throughout
this endeavor?

430
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,420
Darling, we're gonna have
to stop meeting like this.

431
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,210
This is how rumors begin.

432
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,940
You can go now.

433
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,290
Damn it!

434
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,650
Perhaps I'm not making
myself clear here.

435
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,560
This is a threat.

436
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,540
In precisely 3 minutes time,
your little hunting party

437
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,100
will become the prey.

438
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,370
Now, based on your recent failure

439
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,880
to subdue my baby
brother Niklaus,

440
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,790
this despite are better
than 100:1 advantage,

441
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,030
I recommend you heed my warning.

442
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,590
Impressive.

443
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,550
Well, I thought the situation
demanded something a little dramatic.

444
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,010
Who are you people?

445
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,790
I would say the better question--

446
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,160
Is: Who are you?

447
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,320
To a united front.

448
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,340
This act of yours,

449
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,790
the imitation of friendship--

450
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,800
Don't get me wrong.

451
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,080
You play the part well enough.

452
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,160
I should know, having
played it myself,

453
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,610
but there was a time
when the affinity

454
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,510
between us was quite real.

455
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,030
Oh, sure, and then you
got it in your head

456
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,780
to take what I created.

457
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,960
When I picked up that coin,

458
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,520
I swore loyalty,
Klaus, not friendship.

459
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,690
All right. 
I'm holding up my end.

460
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,430
The other one has to be earned.

461
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,190
Fair enough.

462
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,510
Then you should probably
know the whole story.

463
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,970
My decision was not
entirely my own.

464
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,780
If I didn't agree to
usurp your power,

465
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,600
the witches swore to
kill my unborn child.

466
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,630
At first, the promise
of an offspring

467
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,180
meant little to me,

468
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,080
but then I recalled my father,

469
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,930
how he held me in contempt

470
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,720
from the moment I was born.

471
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,210
As yours did with you.

472
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,340
I will not do to my child

473
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,910
what was done to me,

474
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,980
to us.

475
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,470
All this--the spying,
the manipulation--

476
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,610
That's just something
you were forced into.

477
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,940
Is that it?

478
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,380
And what now, you
feel kind of bad?

479
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,850
"Hey, buddy, it's
nothing personal."

480
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,470
Is that it?

481
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,560
I admit...

482
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,010
I was jealous.

483
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,600
I saw the empire you created
on your own without me.

484
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,800
I saw it, and I wanted it.

485
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,520
You're wrong, you know. 
I didn't do it on my own.

486
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,120
I stood in the
shadow of my father

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,620
my entire human life, and
I never would've gotten

488
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,170
out from under it
if not for you.

489
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,190
You're the one who
taught me that a man

490
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,960
can't be defined by
anyone but himself.

491
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,170
So...what now?

492
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,710
This community
that you've built,

493
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,710
you have their respect,

494
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,850
their love.

495
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,470
I can rule them, but
I cannot win them,

496
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,860
not without you.

497
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,900
So rule with me side by side

498
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,820
as equals...

499
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,230
friends...

500
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,260
brothers...

501
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,040
Those werewolves you
ordered killed,

502
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,540
that's my family.

503
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,590
Not for long, Luv.

504
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,620
I mean, this so-called
family of yours,

505
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,510
they haven't done you
much good, have they?

506
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,640
You said it yourself.

507
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,630
They abandoned you,
left you on your own.

508
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,950
Now it's simply your
turn to do the same.

509
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,860
Maybe they had their reasons.

510
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,630
Yes. Well, I have reason,
too, little wolf.

511
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,310
If the werewolves are
dead, then the vampires

512
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,310
have less desire to kill you.

513
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,160
I am trying to keep you safe,

514
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,170
not that you appreciate the effort.

515
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,150
And as soon as I have this baby,

516
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,850
what happens to me then?

517
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,010
Right.

518
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,050
Well, lucky for me,

519
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,620
I have a little while
before I find out,

520
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,590
and in the meantime, I will find
a way to pay you back for this.

521
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,290
As long as I'm in the
family way, well,

522
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,880
you can't do a damn
thing about it.

523
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,850
What are you looking for?

524
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,260
My Violin.

525
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,020
I must've left it in the attic.

526
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,320
So just go get it.

527
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,080
I can't. It's not safe
for me out there.

528
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,780
<i>Funny</i>, I was under
the impression

529
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,300
everyone was afraid of you.

530
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,210
The witches are after me.

531
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,760
You mean, that
crazy witch Agnes?

532
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,980
Yeah. She tried to kill me, too.

533
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,880
The thing is, she's dead.

534
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,400
Elijah killed her.

535
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,330
But...
Agnes was the last living elder.

536
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,470
If she's dead, then I'm safe.

537
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,770
Marcel would've told me.

538
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,280
Maybe he didn't want to lose

539
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,380
his secret weapon
against the witches.

540
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,550
You're lying.

541
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,850
Why would I lie to you?

542
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,030
Because you want
something from me.

543
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,900
Everyone does.

544
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,380
Do I want something from you?

545
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,460
Yeah, Davina.
Actually, I do.

546
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,320
Thanks to your friend, Marcel,

547
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,250
most of my family is cursed.

548
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,160
They're stuck in their wolf
form except on a full moon.

549
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Now, I'm smart enough to know

550
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,430
that every curse has a
loophole, and, well,

551
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,490
You're the strongest witch
i've ever heard of,

552
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,150
but I wouldn't lie to
you to get what I want.

553
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,190
I'd ask you.

554
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,340
I guess that's the difference
between Marcel and me.

555
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,400
Looking for something?

556
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,120
I figured with you vacating,

557
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,500
the attic would be a safe zone.

558
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,870
Found this there.

559
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,350
It was dangerous for you
to come back, Josh.

560
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah. Well, what are
friends for, or whatever?

561
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,870
Hey, what did Hayley want?

562
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,670
Do you trust her?

563
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,190
I don't know.
Why?

564
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,000
She told me about a
witch being killed,

565
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,700
An elder, but I don't know--

566
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, yeah. Crazy Agnes?

567
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,030
I heard about that.

568
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,390
Elijah went all
berserker on her crew.

569
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,940
I guess it was super gross,

570
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,390
just, like, heads and guts.

571
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,430
What?
You hate the witches.

572
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,350
Hayley was right.

573
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,730
Marcel is just using me.

574
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,130
Josh, I can't stay here.

575
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,780
I'm not gonna be their puppet.

576
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,280
You have to get me out of here.

577
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,470
Ok, but where else
are you gonna go?

578
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,840
<i>I stink of the bog.</i>

579
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,120
Serves you right for
your pathetic attempt

580
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,770
to undermine my rule.

581
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,600
Nik, listen.

582
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,460
When I order werewolves to
be hunted to extinction,

583
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,740
I expect you to stand aside
and let the blood flow.

584
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,770
How delightfully
democratic of you.

585
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,030
Do you recognize it?
Perhaps you don't.

586
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,690
It has been 1,000 years
since you last saw it

587
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,180
grace the hand of our mother.

588
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,920
The ring was in possession
of one of the very wolves

589
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,710
whose extinction
you just ordered.

590
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,710
So, naturally, I questioned him.

591
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,040
He spoke of a legend,

592
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,660
a legend wherein long ago,

593
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,490
a chief of theirs had
fathered a child

594
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,760
to a very powerful witch.

595
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,040
Their mythology further states

596
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,230
this child, a son, was
later transformed

597
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,490
into something this clan
had never before seen,

598
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,840
something werewolf and vampire.

599
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,930
Nik, we're trying
to make amends.

600
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,270
We found remnants
of your family,

601
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,600
the bloodline of
your true father,

602
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,770
and we saved them from
being slaughtered

603
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,870
at the hands of the
vampires you command.

604
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,170
Niklaus, your
ambitions have come

605
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,090
before this family
for far too long.

606
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,130
I beseech you, please come home.

607
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,770
What home,

608
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,800
this pathetic substitute?

609
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,710
You see, despite
all your doubts,

610
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,160
all you attempts to thwart me,

611
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,100
I've reclaimed our true home.

612
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,380
I took back the entire city.

613
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,100
You have the audacity to
boast of your victory

614
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,210
when the mother of your child
remains your prisoner?

615
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,290
It all comes down to the
pretty, little wolf,

616
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,130
doesn't it, brother?

617
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,840
Stop it, both of you.

618
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,810
Even if this is
what you say it is,

619
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,960
I have had enough of family
to last me a lifetime.

620
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,560
Why would I possibly
want any more?

621
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,570
Ah, good. You're awake.

622
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,120
I have a favor to ask.

623
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,550
I am saying prayers
for the dead.

624
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,750
I request a moratorium
on favors for the king.

625
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,810
Well, you'll like this one.

626
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,920
It involves helping people
who need protection.

627
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,080
And whom, may I ask, do
they need protection from?

628
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,780
Me.

629
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,730
You see, I recently
ordered the slaughter

630
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,360
of a group of vagabonds
out in the bayou.

631
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
Turns out, I may
have been too hasty.

632
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,850
Thing is, if the
vampires find out

633
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,550
I'm protecting them,
it won't sit well.

634
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,230
I think I can arrange
something...

635
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,870
on one condition.

636
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,730
For her own good,
I believe it is time

637
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,670
for my niece to leave town.

638
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,580
<i>Oh, It's quite all right.
She knows</i>

639
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
<i>She does?</i>

640
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,970
<i>That you're vampires?</i>

641
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,130
<i>Don't worry. He's compelled me</i>

642
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>to forget everything
as soon as I leave.</i>

643
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,080
You are tenacious.

644
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,250
It's one of the things I
like most about you...

645
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,010
Klaus, you can't keep--

646
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,250
But you're looking for truths
you don't want to find.

647
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,110
Monsters better left as fiction.

648
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,140
It's time for you to leave
this place, Cami...

649
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,300
For your own good.

650
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,440
You are such a coward.

651
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,400
This isn't about me.

652
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,050
You have kept me here for weeks
just so someone, anyone,

653
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,230
would see who you really
are, and now that I have,

654
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,060
It scares the hell out
of you, doesn't it?

655
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,270
If you knew even a
fraction of who I am,

656
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,890
it would break you in two.

657
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,910
Then show me.

658
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,750
<i>Niklaus!</i>

659
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,220
<i>It hurts. Aah! Aah!</i>

660
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,410
He's a beast.

661
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,610
<i>Elijah, hold him down.</i>

662
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,160
Brother, please,

663
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,650
Don't let them do this to me.

664
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,980
Do it now, boy. 
Now!

665
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,570
Help me.

666
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,010
Oh, my God.

667
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,720
No one should have to
experience things like that.

668
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,150
Knowing what you do
about this world

669
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,190
will only get you killed,

670
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,140
and I cannot allow that.

671
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,060
Leave New Orleans.

672
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,710
Forget everything you've
learned here today.

673
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,970
Forget me.

674
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,550
You have no reason to stay.

675
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,190
I have no reason to stay.

676
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,960
Look. Things are good with
your brother right now.

677
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,240
He wants to run things
with me as partners,

678
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,310
but if we keep meeting like
this behind his back--

679
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,720
You said it yourself,

680
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,600
whatever it takes to stay alive.

681
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,900
Oh, this is about survival, is it?

682
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,450
If you were this pathetic
a liar with my brother,

683
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,920
I'm surprised he hasn't
killed you already.

684
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,700
Come on, Rebekah.

685
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,460
The only reward anyone ever
gets from loving Niklaus

686
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,300
is suffering and death.

687
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
You're choosing him
over me, aren't you...

688
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,050
again.

689
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,620
Rebekah, I got people
to look out for...

690
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,820
and Klaus is offering
me a chance to do that.

691
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,550
With Davina working her
magic against the witches

692
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,250
and an original by my side,

693
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,480
that's not something I can
just turn my back on,

694
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,630
not even for you.

695
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,580
When you were reliving
history with my brother,

696
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,730
did you happen to revisit
what came next in 1919,

697
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,450
or have you forgotten
our little secret?

698
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,380
I know the words that will
make him hate you forever.

699
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,910
Remember that when you're
embracing your new family.

700
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,130
Are they--

701
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,060
They're safe...

702
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,820
All of them.

703
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,200
Thank you.

704
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,280
What you did, Elijah,
it means a lot.

705
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,320
You should keep this covered.

706
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,210
I will.

707
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,750
If any of the others saw this--

708
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,120
I promise.

709
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,300
I should go.

710
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,470
Right.

711
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,670
Haven't you had your fill
of telling me all the ways

712
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,440
I've disappointed you, Elijah?

713
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,270
Well, there is something important
we neglected to discuss.

714
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,130
I accused you of having ulterior
motives regarding the child.

715
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,630
I was wrong.

716
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,970
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,960
I imagine that must have
been hard for you to say.

718
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,700
You don't make it easy
to love you, brother.

719
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,860
And yet you're obstinate
in your desire to do so.

720
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,910
When you're ready, 
should you be so inclined,

721
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,880
both you and Rebekah, 
are welcome to join me here.

722
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,500
It is, after all,
our family home.

723
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,280
Cami, I need your help.

724
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,040
Marcel has been lying to me,
and I can't trust him anymore.

725
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,340
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

726
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,420
Oh, you've been compelled.

727
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,510
Ok. What are you doing?

728
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,160
It's OK. 
I can fix you.

729
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,120
I'm really sorry,

730
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,220
but this is gonna hurt.
