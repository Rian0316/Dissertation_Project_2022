1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,382
您的账单
Here's your check.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,712
薯条没算在里面 因为被我吃掉了
I didn't charge you for the fries, 'cause I ate them.

3
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,081
Max 当心!
Max, look out!

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,750
餐厅里的水蝽大得惊人
The diner water bugs are getting really big.

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,503
别紧张 这是餐厅最新的无人侦察机
Relax, it's the diner's new surveillance drone.

6
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,672
天啊 我只是中饱私囊了几次
God, you empty the register five or ten times,

7
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,557
转眼信任就没了
suddenly there's no trust.

8
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:31,097
所以我们连肥皂都没有 却有架无人机?
So to be clear, we're out of soap but we have a drone?

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,850
我真受不了Han在暗地里监控我们
I hate that Han's just sitting in back, watching us,

10
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:37,103
还把操纵杆玩得那么欢
working his little joy stick.

11
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:42,325
拜托 就Han那小棒棒任谁也欢不了
Please, no one's getting any joy out of Han's little stick.

12
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:44,277
这家伙真烦人
This is so annoying.

13
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,679
总跟我屁股后面
It's following me.

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,498
就你那扁平的屁股 这是唯一一个
Well, with a butt that flat, it's the only black thing

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,168
肯跟在你身后的黑大壮了吧
that's ever going to follow you.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,621
这里还有只嗡嗡叫的家伙?
Ugh, there's another drone out here?

17
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:57,040
我刚在厨房用苍蝇拍拍死一只
I just killed one in the kitchen with a fly swatter.

18
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,374
走开
Go.

19
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,176
我要是想被暗中监视
I mean, if I wanted to be spied on,

20
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,628
早就改名叫阿克曼了
I'd change my name to Achmed,

21
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,628
{\an8}"往生恐怖份子阿克曼"是网络点击率极高的表演短片

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,382
或者是在机场附件买个公寓
and buy a condo near the airport.

23
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,051
咋不买这样的一幅画呢
Whatever happened to buying a painting

24
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:10,353
画着一个老船长把观察孔挖空
of an old sea captain, drilling out the eye holes,

25
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,221
躲在后面窥视的那种
and hiding behind it?

26
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,190
这样不好 Han
Not cool, Han.

27
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,975
最糟糕的是 它老是乱动
And the worst part is, it's moving around so much,

28
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:19,145
害得我都找不准角度
I can't find my good angle.

29
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,481
这样就不是Han的做派了
Not cool and not Han.

30
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:24,067
这是在他跟我解释拿最低工资的
I stole this while he was explaining to me

31
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,320
77岁老头为何不需要医保的时候
why a 77-year-old man, on minimum wage,

32
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:29,872
我趁机偷的
doesn't need health care.

33
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,658
Earl 这挺不错的啊
Earl, that is awesome.

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,911
才不好 我真的需要那医保
Not really. I need that health care.

35
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,496
不 我指的是你偷的这玩意
No, that you stole that.

36
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:37,580
我们得采取点措施 好让Han
We need to do something that will make Han

37
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,249
永远不再想监视我们
never want to spy on us again.

38
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,586
Oleg 解开裤带
Oleg, open your pants.

39
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:47,340
Earl 把摄像头对准那里
Earl, fly that camera in there.

40
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:50,226
但首先 你得脱掉内裤
But first, take off your underwear.

41
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:54,597
内裤?
Underwear?

42
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,101
别逗了 当我还小?
Come on. What am I, five?

43
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:00,269
还是我"弟弟"小?
Inches?

44
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,775
Oleg 你难道不担心Earl的白内障吗?
Oleg, aren't you at all worried about Earl's cataracts?

45
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:08,561
最好的打算 是被刮掉阴毛
Best case scenario, I get a little manscaping.

46
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:13,750
最差的打算 就是被割下包皮
Worst case, I've been meaning to get circumcised.

47
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,120
我被亮瞎了!
My eyes!

50
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,401
Max 我在填写银行贷款的支票
Max, I'm writing out the check for our bank loan,

51
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,319
但不是很确定余额是多少
and I'm not quite sure what our balance is

52
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:48,042
因为在"提款"处 你只写了"是的"
because here under "Withdrawal"" You just wrote, "Yeah""

53
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,827
你不喜欢那个的话 肯定也不会喜欢
Well, if you don't like that, you're really not going to like

54
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,495
我在"存款"处作的画了
the picture I drew under "Deposits."

55
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,665
我看见了
I saw it.

56
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,750
Max 零可不是蛋蛋 不是咪咪
Max, zeroes are not balls, they're not boobs,

57
00:02:56,752 --> 00:03:01,555
更不是金鱼眼
and they're not googly eyes.

58
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,757
零就只是零
They're just zeroes.

59
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,260
那是你认为
Says you.

60
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:08,112
我去取款机查查余额
I'll go check our balance at the ATM.

61
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:09,597
虽然刚刚使用这机器的人
Even though the last guy who touched it

62
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,015
长了个很大的唇疱疹
had a cold sore so big,

63
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,184
我收了他两倍的费用
I charged him for a party of two.

64
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,102
别担心 你从那台破机器上
Don't worry. You are not going to get anything

65
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:16,270
什么都得不到
from that machine.

66
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,023
特别是钱
Especially cash.

67
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,208
嗨 各位亲
Hey, everybody.

68
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:25,813
对了
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:27,531
来个人给我煮些蛋蛋
Somebody better make me some eggs

70
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,117
因为我进行了三个小时的果汁节食
because I've been on a juice cleanse for three hours,

71
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,036
都饿晕了
and I'm dizzy.

72
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,121
他们说这种方法很有效
Yeah. I mean, they call it a fast,

73
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:37,141
但很显然见效慢
but it sure does go slow.

74
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,793
曾有人说很快 结果我等了三个星期
I was on a three weeks fast, once.

75
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:43,931
然后我才意识到我妈不会回家了
Then I realized my mother wasn't coming home.

76
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,550
所以我自己做了个三明治
So I made a sandwich.

77
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,469
我和Oleg新婚在即
Oleg and my wedding is coming up

78
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:51,889
我们想吃得干净一点
and we're trying to eat clean.

79
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,908
没错 宝贝 因为我们度蜜月时
Yeah, baby, 'cause you know we're eating dirty

80
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,279
会吃那些淫水
on the honeymoon.

81
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,399
老天爷啊 怎么了?
Oh, dear God, what?

82
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:05,736
收据槽里又塞了个套套?
Another used condom in the receipt slot?

83
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,621
- 比这更糟  - 那是什么?
- Worse.   - What?

84
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,576
该戴套套却没有戴?
Stuff that should be in a condom but isn't?

85
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:15,079
我们负债了
We're below zero.

86
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:18,916
我得走了 伙计们
Oh, well, I better go, y'all.

87
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,086
有个白人妇女在我身边尖叫
A white woman screaming anywhere in my vicinity

88
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,339
绝对不是好事
never turns out well.

89
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,757
这简直是飞来横祸
This is a disaster.

90
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,142
我曾经一无所有过
I've been at zero,

91
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,594
但从不至于亏空
but I've never had less than zero.

92
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,346
别这么说 Caroline
Oh, don't say that, Caroline.

93
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:36,850
你忘了你的约会对象人数了
I mean, you're forgetting about your dating options.

94
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,819
我们现在负债了
We have less than zero money

95
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,689
无法偿还银行贷款
and no way of paying off our bank loan.

96
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,440
天啊 终于落到这地步了
Oh, my God. It happened.

97
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:46,360
我成工人阶级了
I'm working class.

98
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:49,029
嘿 我跟你一块儿当了四年的服务员
Hey. I've waited tables with you for four years

99
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,548
你敢说自己这是在工作吗
and there's no way you could call what you do working.

100
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,004
纸杯蛋糕!
Cupcakes!

101
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,123
买纸杯蛋糕
Buy cupcakes.

102
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,626
来买纸杯蛋糕!
Buy cupcakes!

103
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,011
别喊了
Stop.

104
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,879
你看着比卡尔文广告里的贾斯汀·比伯
You look more desperate than Justin Bieber

105
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:09,883
还要绝望
in that Calvin Klein ad.

106
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,385
你根本不懂银行贷款的事
You don't understand the seriousness

107
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,220
有多么严重
of this bank situation.

108
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:17,057
你根本不懂魔兽世界里的规则
You don't understand the rules of World Of Warcraft.

109
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,560
贷款会不断地翻倍增加
The loan just keeps escalating and escalating

110
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:22,396
直到逼我们倒闭
until they close us down.

111
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:25,032
纸杯蛋糕! 来买纸杯蛋糕!
Cupcakes! Buy cupcakes!

112
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,035
来买纸杯蛋糕! 来买纸杯蛋糕!
Buy cupcakes! Buy cupcakes!

113
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,403
快看 有肥肉
Oh, Pay-dirt. Look.

114
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,822
是联谊会那又肥又胖的大个子
Here comes a big, fat frat house guy.

115
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,741
嘿 贱人们
Hey, bitches.

116
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,542
还记得我吗?
Remember me?

117
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,211
大个子玛丽
Big Mary.

118
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,830
就是这名字 永不过时
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

119
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:42,416
John 从糕点学校后就没见过你
John, we haven't seen you since pastry school.

120
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,418
嘿 看在老交情上 要买个纸杯蛋糕吗?
Hey, for old times' sake, want to buy a cupcake?

121
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,421
一打? 整个店?
A dozen? The shop?

122
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,423
我来这里是因为我可能
So I came because I may know of a way

123
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,392
有办法让Max赚一些外快
for Max to make some extra money.

124
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,927
不管什么工作 她都做
Whatever it is, she'll do it.

125
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:57,264
那可是我纪念册上的座右铭
That was my yearbook quote.

126
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,849
我刚刚入职一家新开的餐厅
I just got hired at a new restaurant

127
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,067
就在曼哈顿的
that's opening under the High Line Park

128
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,069
高线公园 他们正在招聘一名
in Manhattan, and they are looking

129
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,104
白天上班的糕点师
for another day pastry chef.

130
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:06,273
我虽然只在糕点学校呆了一年
I only have a year of pastry school

131
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,742
不过貌似那一年我都神智恍惚
and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.

132
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,694
我不知道我能不能胜任
I don't know if I have the skills.

133
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:14,248
噢 别逗了 你肯定不够资格
Oh, girl, you don't.

134
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,451
但是那个经理 Joe 只看脸
But the manager, Joe, wants only pretty people.

135
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:18,786
你的美貌和性感足以
And what you lack in pastry,

136
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,455
弥补你专业能力的不足
you more than make up for in pretty.

137
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,457
她会去的 你会去的Max
She'll do it. You'll do it, Max.

138
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,758
有技术高超的John在那里
And John will be there to help back you up

139
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,093
他会帮助你的
with his pastry skills.

140
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,129
人家也是很美貌的
And 'cause I'm pretty.

141
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:31,298
我觉得那种地方不适合我
I don't belong in a place like that.

142
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,716
餐厅的名字叫 "糕潮" 
It's called "The High."

143
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:36,637
听起来不错 地址给我
Sounds right. Give me the deets.

144
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,138
嗨 晚上好 女士们
Well, good night girls.

145
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,773
你们负债了 为此我很难过
Sorry about your bank balance.

146
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,108
但是我相信你们会像从前那样
But I trust you'll both lapse

147
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,812
很快地陷入自我否定当中
into denial fairly soon, as always.

148
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:46,146
嗨
Hello.

149
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:53,287
她是谁?
Who was she?

150
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,740
抱紧我 我的小舞伴
Hold me closer, tiny dancer.

151
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,129
噢... Han不是同性恋
Oh... Han's not gay.

152
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,331
仅仅目前 "还不是"
You forgot the "Yet."

153
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,977
Max 是不是应该系上一两个扣子
Max, maybe button up a button or two.

154
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,363
这是餐吧 又不是酒吧
It's a dessert bar. Not a strip bar.

155
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,448
嘿 我需要这份工作
Hey, I need this job,

156
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,402
一旦这个叫Joe的家伙看见这对膨松的大馒头
and once this Joe guy takes one look at these puff pastries,

157
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,504
也许他就会手下留情
he might cut me some slack when he sees

158
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:30,490
无视我做的那些不怎么膨松的糕点
my other "Not so puff" Pastries.

159
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,492
你这样能心安理得吗?
And you're comfortable with that?

160
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,710
没错
Yup.

161
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,628
就像我觉得
Like I guess you're comfortable

162
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,913
你的服务水平那么差
applying for a waitress job

163
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,499
也敢心安理得地去应聘服务员
on just the merits of your waitress skills.

164
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,721
我要再多解开几个扣子吗?
Should I keep going?

165
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,589
有用吗?
Why?

166
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,675
我来了
I'm here.

167
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,260
把申请表都给我吧 速度 女士们
I'll take those applications. Hurry, ladies.

168
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,448
如果我要找个好看却又反应慢的人 我就会雇佣尼克·乔纳斯
If I was looking for pretty and slow, I'd hire Nick Jonas.

169
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,617
Max 我们走吧
Max, let's get out of here.

170
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,569
她让我想到了
She reminds me of this nightmare

171
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,654
关于自己余生惨状的噩梦
I'm going to have for the rest of my life.

172
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:03,406
别怕 她只不过是经理的看门狗
Relax, she's just his guard dog.

173
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:05,074
Joe才是我们要搞定的家伙
It's Joe guy we have to impress.

174
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,242
不行 谢谢
No thank you.

175
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:07,610
不行 谢谢
No thank you.

176
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,829
你居然有脸来申请?
And how dare you?

177
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,001
噢 抱歉 明天餐厅才营业呢
Oh, I'm sorry, the restaurant doesn't open until tomorrow.

178
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,536
实际上 不
Actually, no.

179
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,921
嗨 我是来应聘服务生工作的
Hi. I'm here to apply for a waitress job.

180
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,456
就你这把年纪?
At your age?

181
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,175
我27了!
I'm 27!

182
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,926
那又如何?
And?

183
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:26,295
Max 我不能呼吸了
Max, I can't breathe.

184
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,549
我是来应聘糕点师的
And I'm here to apply for a pastry chef.

185
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,052
我也27 但我从6岁时就长这样
Also 27, but I've looked this old since I was 6.

186
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,222
曾有一段时间 我以为自己都逆生长了
For a while, I thought I had that Benjamin Button's disease.

187
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,608
我先来面试糕点师
I'll take the pastry chef first.

188
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,976
你坐在旁边等会吧
Why don't you sit over there and wait.

189
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,195
不会很久的 因为坦白说
I won't be long, because frankly,

190
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:45,064
你不会有很多时间的
you don't have the time.

191
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,200
谢谢 我就在那等着
Thank you. I'll be over there.

192
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:51,220
申请一下社保
Applying for Social Security.

193
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:53,456
你在哪个学校学的烘焙
So where did you go to pastry school,

194
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,291
现在为什么没工作?
and why aren't you working now?

195
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,877
曼哈顿烘焙学校 我现在有工作
Manhattan School Of Pastry, and I am working.

196
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,662
我在布鲁克林有自己的蛋糕店
I have my own cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

197
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,964
噢 快结束了
Oh, it's almost over.

198
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,332
这次面试? 太棒了
This interview? Great.

199
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,168
不 不是面试 布鲁克林
No. Not the interview. Brooklyn.

200
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,669
布鲁克林快不行了
Brooklyn's almost over.

201
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,339
而且 纸杯蛋糕也没落了
Also, cupcakes.

202
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,925
酷 我会转告他们的
Cool. I will tell them.

203
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,343
真希望我能在他们为了扮酷
Wish I knew that before they all got

204
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,397
在肚脐眼上打孔之前就知道
their belly buttons pierced trying to stay cool.

205
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,399
噢 太棒了 幽默感

顾客们喜欢
Customers love that.

00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,853
我不喜欢 但是他们喜欢
I don't, but they do.

208
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,407
那位叫Joe的帅哥在哪呢?
So, um, where's this Joe guy who's doing the hiring?

209
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,859
这里没有叫Joe的帅哥 我就是Joe
There is no "Joe guy"" I'm Joe.

210
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,744
是这么拼的J-O-E-D-T-H 
Spelled, J-O-E-D-T-H.

211
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,781
D-T-H 不发音
The D-T-H is silent.

212
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,917
我也不出声 因为我想要这工作
As am I, because I want this job.

213
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,002
那么 我想我可以把扣子扣上了
Well, I guess I can put these away then.

214
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,754
这就是你的计划?
That was your plan?

215
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:45,041
袒胸露乳来勾引老板?
To expose your breasts and seduce your way into this job?

216
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:49,679
听起来你觉得这行为不妥
You say that like it's a bad thing.

217
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,180
那么 好吧 再见
Okay. Well, bye.

218
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,765
且慢 坐下
Sit, sit.

219
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,133
如果你真的能烘焙
If you really can bake,

220
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,018
那么这份工作就很适合你了
this position might be perfect for you.

221
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,353
而且 你很任性
Also, you have that edgy,

222
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,472
一副无所谓的态度
"I don't give a crap" Attitude.

223
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,690
顾客喜欢你这样的
Customers love that.

224
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,526
我不喜欢 但是他们喜欢
I don't, but they do.

225
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:07,864
其实 DTH不发音的Joe 我会烘焙
Actually, Joe, silent D-T-H, I can bake.

226
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,449
技术怎么样?
But how well?

227
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,952
我女朋友和我对法国糕点很狂热
My girlfriend and I are obsessed with French pastry.

228
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:17,990
噢 女朋友是真的 "女朋友"
Oh. Girlfriend as in "Girlfriend,"

229
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,542
还是在电影院里
or as in two ladies of a certain age

230
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:23,079
分吃一桶爆米花的同龄女性朋友?
at a Cineplex splitting one thing of popcorn?

231
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,965
刚刚你说的每一句话都冒犯了我
Everything you just said offended me.

232
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:29,051
没错 这就是我的特点
Yeah, that's my brand.

233
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,303
而你又没对坐在电影院分吃爆米花
And the fact that you didn't cry

234
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,637
大喊大叫让我觉得
about splitting a popcorn makes me think

235
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,390
你有的是第一种女朋友
it's the first kind of girlfriend.

236
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,392
你做的马卡龙怎么样?
How are your macaroons?

237
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:41,514
呃... 哦 唔
Uh...oh. Mm.

238
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,268
我的马卡龙?
My macaroons?

239
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,571
棒极了
Great.

240
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:51,824
只要一小口 就仿若置身法国天堂
A little bit of French heaven.

241
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,609
你叫什么?
What is your name?

242
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,912
我叫Max
Max.

243
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:59,248
这么拼M-a-x
M-a-x.

244
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,419
每个字都如雷贯耳
Nothing is silent. Ever.

245
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,955
我懂了
So I gather.

246
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,958
好了 你去填写申请表吧 Max
Okay. Why don't you go fill out an application, Max.

247
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,510
扣子可以扣上了
And you can put those away again.

248
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:13,045
我不怎么爱大波妹的
I'm really not into big-breasted women.

249
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,049
搞定了
Girl, you got this.

250
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,807
第一天上班紧张吗 老妹儿?
First day. Are you nervous, girl?

251
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,476
拜托 在你的三个哥哥都出柜了之后
Please. Nervous is telling your elderly Mormon parents

252
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,312
还得告诉年迈的爹妈说自己也是同性恋
that you're gay after your three older siblings

253
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,448
那才叫紧张呢
already came out.

254
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,368
我都不知道这些甜品都是啥玩意
I have no idea what most of these desserts are.

255
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,322
自"迷失"剧终后 我从未感到如此迷失了
I haven't felt this lost since the finale of Lost.

256
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,458
Max 我身上还有挂着巴尼百货的标价牌吗?
Max, can you see any of the Barney's price tags on these?

257
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,659
哦 你的裤子里面好像
Uh, I think there's one bunching up

258
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,294
有个标签支出来了
inside the back of your pants.

259
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:48,464
那是内裤的标签 我得还回去的
No, that's the underwear I'm also returning.

260
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,383
她来了
Here she comes.

261
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,151
嗨 姑娘们 这是Naomi
Hi, ladies. This is Naomi,

262
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,753
甜点餐台的迎宾小姐
the dessert bar hostess.

263
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,555
走啊 Naomi 走
Go, Naomi, go.

264
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:03,646
人长得好看 但就跟时下的新偶像一样傻
Gorgeous, but as dumb as whoever is the hot new idiot right now.

265
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,315
让我看一下你们
Let me take a look at you.

266
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,351
走吧
Good-bye.

267
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,152
这就不要我了?
Already?

268
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,605
珍珠项链 快扔掉
Those pearls. They have to go.

269
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,990
为什么啊?
Really? It's just, well,

270
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:16,275
它们对我来说有特殊意义的
I'm kind of emotionally attached to them.

271
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,694
亲 我爱我的法国斗牛犬
Well, honey, I love my half-blind French bulldog,

272
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,831
但我可不把它挂在脖子上
but I don't wear her around my neck.

273
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,166
Max 让我看一下
Max, let me take a look.

274
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,167
很好
Love it.

275
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,587
大方得体 很赞
Fabulous. Well done.

276
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,840
嗨 Joe 新店开张 我太兴奋了
Hi, Joe. Big day. I'm so excited.

277
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:34,677
你可以进去一个人偷着乐吗?
Why don't you be excited in the back, doll?

278
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,629
我想让Max站在前台
I want Max up front now.

279
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,298
人们一直在对我说别出柜
All my life, people have been telling me not to come out.

280
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,135
看来这里的也不希望我出啊?
Why should here be any different?

281
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,872
姑娘们 我刚听说纽约时报的美食评论家
Ladies, I just got word that the New York Times food critic

282
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:49,859
今天下午会突然造访

283
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:51,861
我们要尽善尽美...
Everything has to be perfect...

284
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:53,446
服务周到 甜点美味
the service, the desserts,

285
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,465
还有我脆弱的小神经
the precarious balance of my meds.

286
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,784
不能出一丝差错
Nothing can go wrong.

287
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:00,369
Naomi啊
Naomi.

288
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:01,988
快去接待
Fetch.

289
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,158
"欢迎来到'糕潮'餐厅"
"Welcome to The High"

290
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
"嗨 欢迎来到'糕潮'餐厅"
"Hi. Welcome to The High""

291
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,545
"欢迎来到'糕潮'餐厅"
"Welcome to The High"

292
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:13,966
别再说"糕潮"了 我现在一点也不兴奋
Stop saying high. It reminds me I'm not.

293
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,885
等等 Max 你不兴奋?
Wait, Max, you're not high?

294
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,837
一点都没?
Like, not high at all?

295
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,173
没有 我可不想把事情搞砸
No. I didn't want to screw today up.

296
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,060
你到底是怎么回事啊?
What the hell is wrong with you?

297
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,512
你今天怎么也得撑下去
You can't change who you are today.

298
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,513
纽约时报要来了
The New York Times is coming.

299
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,181
你怎么应对?
How will you cope?

300
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,018
你上一次不兴奋是在啥时候了?
I mean, when's the last time you weren't high?

302
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,322

00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,743
其实是我妈喝的
Well, my mother had.

305
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,161
我得去招呼客人了
I have to go wait on those customers.

306
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,612
你要使出全力
Do what you can to get with the program.

307
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,448
我是说 你赶紧兴奋起来
I mean, get off the program.

308
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,085
不吸上几口 不能搞烘焙
You can't bake not baked.

309
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,586
大玛丽?
Big Mary?

John?

311
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,506
你怎么不叫我的新名字?

312
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:55,925
卡西莫多
Quasimodo.

315
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:59,045
我有大麻吗?
Do I have any weed?

316
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,881
我到自己的驼背里那里找找
Let me check my hump.

317
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,217
没有大麻
Nope. No weed.

318
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,886
谢谢 Rico 因为严禁种族歧视
Thanks, Rico. I didn't want to ask

319
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,888
我本来都不打算问你要的
due to the city-wide ban on racial profiling.

320
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,392
哇 这个储物间比新泽西州长
Wow. This dish room is cleaner

321

克里斯·克里斯蒂的盘子还干净

很好 真为你骄傲
Well, good. I'm so proud of you.

325
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:27,206
这简直是"辣妈辣妹"的情景再现
This is so Freaky Friday.

326

薰衣草杏仁饼干来了

纽约时报的美食评论家有可能

会和Han Earl Oleg 还有Sophie坐在一起

334
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,385
我们死定了 死于11点30分
We're dead. Time of death, 11:30.

335
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,721
我在4点20分就死了
I believe it's more like 4:20.

336
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,561
哦 Caroline 我喜欢这地方
Oh, Caroline, I love your new place.

337
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,063
看起来清新亮丽
It's so fresh and pretty.

338
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:21,351
就像那些傻逼广告
It kind of looks like a douche commercial.

339
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,819
说的没错 亲爱的
You're right, baby.

340
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,856
确实很像那些傻逼广告
It looks exactly like a douche commercial.

341
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,692
好了 能不能不要在高级甜品店
Okay. Can we stop saying "Douche"

342
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,443
说"傻逼"这个词?
in the fancy pastry shop?

343
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:33,497
我同意 太不合适了
I agree. Not appropriate.

344
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,032
亲爱的Caroline 请把我的电话号码
Caroline, darling, slip my phone number

345
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,952
给那边的努比亚美女
to that fine Nubian princess.

346
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,288
并转告她 不要被我的老屁股给迷惑了
And tell her not to be fooled by my bad hip.

347
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,042
我会带她嗨翻世界
I can still gently rock her world.

348
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,844
好吧 你们来这里是干嘛呢
Okay, guys, what are you doing here

349
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,596
能不能快点离开?
and how quickly can you leave?

350
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:50,714
太好了
Real nice.

351
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,882
我们大老远过来
After we came all this way

352
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,466
只想尝尝Max
to just order only desserts

353
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,935
独家烹饪的甜点
that Max knows how to make

354
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:57,804
感受你周到热情的服务
and to say nice things about you as a waitress.

355
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,773
哦 你们是为了我?
Oh, you'd do that for me?

356
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,775
当然不是 我演不下去了
Hell no, I can't pull that off.

357
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,362
如果我会演戏 我早就卖了餐厅
If I could act, I'd sell the restaurant

358
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,731
接演有线电视节目的
and get cast in two-line roles as the doctor

359
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,067
那些医生角色
on any network television show.

360
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,652
Sophie是真正的演员
Sophie's the actress.

361
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:15,238
而且她很有一套
And trust me, she's got quite a repertoire.

362
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,624
我称她为床上奥斯卡演后
In bed, I call her Meryl Sheets.

363
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,376
来一个 亲爱的
Do it, baby.

364
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:27,551
哦 这地方真不错
Oh, what a lovely place.

365
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,586
她这口音就是在我们扮演
That's the accent she uses when we play

366
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,805
"为性奴十二年"用的
"12 Years A Sex Slave."

367
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,092
帅哥美女们 我马上回来
Lovely, be right back.

368
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,345
对了 欢迎光临"糕潮"
Oh, and, welcome to The High.

369
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,181
那张桌是怎么回事?
What's going on with that table?

370
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,984
那是镇上的欧洲马戏团吗?
Is there a European circus in town?

371
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,152
马戏团? 我不清楚
A circus? Well, I wouldn't know.

372
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:47,771
我完全不知道他们是谁
I really have no idea who they are.

373
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,240
那不是在问你话
That didn't require an answer.

374
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,410
而是我准确无误的观察结果
It was just one of my dead-on observations.

375
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,111
把他们打发走吧
Just get rid of them.

376
00:16:55,113 --> 00:17:01,001
就说 我们的漏斗蛋糕卖完了
Tell them we've run out of funnel cakes.

377
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:05,589
我感觉找回自己了
Well, I'm feeling like my old self.

378
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,208
Joe刚刚让我把他们打发走
Joe just told me to lose Han, Earl, Oleg, and Sophie.

379
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,427
我要怎么弄走那么多人?
How am I supposed to lose that many people?

380
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,929
我又不是航空管制员
I'm not air traffic control.

381
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,764
你表现得像是他们不懂得在高档场合
You are acting like they don't know how to act

382
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,683
该如何言行
in a fancy place.

383
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,685
姑娘们 看啊!
Girls, look!

384
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:22,055
Oleg把餐巾纸当作派对帽那样来戴
Oleg's wearing his napkin as a party hat.

385
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,280
你的甜品 祝你胃口大开
Here's your dessert. Bon appetite.

386
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,616
Max 我不敢相信你做到了
Max, I can't believe you just made that.

387
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,784
我也不敢相信
Neither can I.

388
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,987
你跟Oleg和Sophie说什么了?
And what did you say to Oleg and Sophie?

389
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,788
已经一小时了 我都没看到
It's been an hour, and I haven't seen

390
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,291
任何不雅的举动
any over-the-table penetration.

391
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,660
我只是告诉他们 拿出最好的礼仪来
I just told them to be on their best behavior,

392
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,462
然后他们就没事了
and they're fine with it.

393
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,163
打扰一下 Max
Excuse me, Max.

394
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,348
对 你好
Yes, hi.

395
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,083
我能去尿尿吗?
May I go tinkle?

396
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:54,421
还是说 这违反了监狱甜品区的规矩?
Or is that against the law here at Guantanamo Dessert Bay?

397
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:57,057
我要去女厕所做爱
I'm gonna go have sex in the ladies room.

398
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,076
除非你们这两个假正经的人也反对这事
Unless you two prudes have a problem with that, too.

399
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,596
打扰一下
Excuse me.

400
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:04,848
能给我一杯拿铁和一杯红酒吗?
Can I get a latte and a red wine?

401
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,985
因为有片止痛药堵在我喉咙里了
'Cause I got a Vicodin stuck in my throat.

402
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,939
天啊
Oh, my God.

00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,240
大中午的有谁能够
Who could be that messed up

404
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,909
这么狼狈不堪?
in the middle of the afternoon?

405
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:19,612
呃 我的新闺蜜
Uh, my new best friend.

406
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:21,498
我最好必须在Joe或者是
I better get rid of her before Joe

407
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,450
时报评论员进来前 把她撵走
or that Times critic walks in.

408
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,503
你继续偶然地创造出美食吧
You keep doing good things by accident.

409
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,871
你好 我能不能...
Hi, can I get a...

410
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,756

You sure can. Anywhere but here.

411
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,459
哦 不 现在我不能转圈圈
Oh, no. Spinning's not good for me right now.

412
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,129
她在这儿干什么?
What is she doing here?

413
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,347
马上离开 你就当没看见过她
Leaving. You never saw her.

414
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,015
- 等等  - Joe 我来搞定
- Wait.  - Joe, I got this.

415
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,517
我在学校的闺蜜曾经对
My bestie at school was totally hooked

416
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,569
处方药相当上瘾 持续差不多一周
on prescription pills for, like, a week.

417
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,938
嘿 你好啊
Hey, hi, you.

418
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,191
你好 请问Max在哪里?
Excuse me. Where is Max?

419
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,309
她去后厨一下下
She's in the back for a sec.

420
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,894
看来...
So...

421
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,812
我们又见面了
We meet again.

422
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:55,231
先生 你找后厨的人有事吗?
Sir, do you need something in the back?

423
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,784
是的 Caroline说她会给我一张餐巾纸
Yes, Caroline said she'd bring me a napkin,

424
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:02,322
但是我直接打电话给华纳都比她来得要快
but I could get Time Warner on the phone faster than that.

425
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,957
去问Max啊
Just ask Max.

426
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,377
她一直在餐厅替Caroline打掩护
She covers for Caroline all the time at the diner.

427
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,562
Max 是吗?
Max?

428
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,832
噢 有好戏看了
Ooh. Drama at The High.

429
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,784
Han 那是我的新老板
Han, that's my new boss.

430
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,569
别再说了
Stop talking.

431
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,889
还有 别再收集贴纸了 你是大人了
Also, stop collecting stickers. You're a grown-up.

432
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,093
好了 我把那个药瘾女赶走了
Okay, I threw that drug addict out.

433
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,062
那个药瘾女是我的女朋友
That drug addict is my girlfriend.

434
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,515
更多好戏在后头
More drama at The High.

435
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,600
Caroline 我有事情跟你说
And Caroline, we have a problem.

436
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,268
你管Allie叫药瘾女
You called Allie a drug addict.

437
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,453
哦 那是她的名字吗?
Oh, is that her name?

438
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:34,821
Allie? 真可爱
Allie? So cute.

439
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,773
还很美
Even lovelier.

440
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,742
刚那个小不点说
And according to that very small man,

441
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,028
你还是个糟糕的服务员
you're also a terrible waitress.

442
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,165
我都不知道你们俩在一起
But I had no idea you two were together.

443
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:48,585
我还以为是更有力的...
I would have thought a powerful...

444
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,337
打住 现在
Stop. Now.

445
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:54,257
Joe 我们真的很需要这些工作
Joe, look, we really need these jobs.

446
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,426
我们在糕点生意上做了错误的决定
We made a bad decision with our bakery business,

447
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,629
导致我们无法偿还巨额的银行贷款
and we have a big bank loan that we can't pay.

448
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,047
很诚实 不错
Honesty. Good.

449
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,049
大家都会被诚实打动
People respond to honesty.

450
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,969
虽然我不会 但他们会
