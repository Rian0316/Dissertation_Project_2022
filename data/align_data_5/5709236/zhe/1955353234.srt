現在什么都不清楚
Don't know anything yet.

108
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,020
出了這種事  不是喝醉  吸毒就是吵架了

109
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,510
八成就是這樣
It is how it is.

116
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,360
數據鑒證科  負責電腦技術
Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

117
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,080
那怎么走了  覺得無聊了嗎
What happened, you get bored of it?

118
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,320
也不是
Not exactly.

119
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,530
你也看過人們都在這玩意里藏了些什么
You've seen what people tuck away on these.

120

陰謀啊  殺人名單啊  兒童色情什么的
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.

121

一點都不無聊
It's not boring.

122
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
我還記得年輕的時候
I'm old enough to remember

123
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,010
人們也是滿腦子想著這種事
when they walked around with that stuff

124
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,620
只不過都藏在腦子里
just tucked away in their heads.

125
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,400
是啊  不過現在他們
Right. But now they can't help

126
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,060
都把這些東西托付給這個小幫手
but entrusting it to their little companions.

127
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,100
這東西吸收了我們的人格
These things absorb who we are.

128
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,450
對我們無所不知
They know everything about us.

129
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,580
既然不是無聊  那為什么離開鑒證科
If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?

130
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,590
蘭諾赫案
The Rannoch case.

131
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,540
-伊安·蘭諾赫  -對  那個兒童殺手
- Ian Rannoch? - The child killings, yeah.

132
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,450
就是我破解了他的紀念品文件夾
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.

133
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
所以那些圖片你也看到了
So you saw those pictures?

134
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,470
還有視頻  全都看了
And the videos too. Saw them all.

135
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,830
那種東西  看一眼就能改變你
You see something like that, it changes you.

136
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
你要么就此崩潰  要么會想...
You either get defeated or you think...

137
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,070
你會想  "去他的  我得阻止這些人渣"
You think, "Fuck me! I've got to help stop that shit."

138
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,360
對
Yeah.

139
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,880
-在外勤工作  -什么外勤
- I mean, out here in the field...  - What fucking field?

140
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,140
你懂我的意思  就是在現實世界里
You know what I mean. Out here in the real world,

141
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,070
我們真的可以阻止壞事  對不對
you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?

142
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,130
你還太年輕
You are young.

143
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,010
也許是你太老
Maybe you're old?

144
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,350
小心哦
Steady.

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,790
多謝
Thanks.

146
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,470
-明天見  -好的  老大
- See you tomorrow. - Yes, boss.

147
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,630
喬·鮑爾斯被發現死于倫敦西區的家中
Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.

148
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,670
{\an8}專欄作家死亡

149
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,160
這位資深專欄作家近日身陷輿論漩渦
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy

150
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,670
起因是她寫了一篇
over an article she'd written

151
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,660
關于殘疾人權益活動家格溫·馬博里的文章
about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.

152
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,210
警方尚未查明死因
The police have yet to confirm the cause--

153
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,690
{\an8}第二天

154
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,790
-這么早就開工  -我拜托尼克給我看監控
- Starting early? - I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

155
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,490
-是嗎  -嗯
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

156
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,680
沒發現有人進出  整晚只有喬和她丈夫
No one came in or out. Just Jo and her husband all evening.

157
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,790
-那一個呢  -是后院的
- And that one there? - Rear patio.

158
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,640
看來已經壞了幾個月了
Bust for months by the looks of it.

159
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,370
可能有人從那里進去的
Someone could've come in through there.

160
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,240
那他們得翻柵欄進來  作案后再翻出去
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out,

161
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,570
而且事先知道攝像頭壞了
knowing the camera wasn't working,

162
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,710
不過的確是有可能  嚴格來講
but yeah, could have happened. Technically.

163
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,270
好  抱歉
Okay, sorry.

164
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,620
挺熱心啊你
You're keen to help.

165
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,670
家求我的
She just asked!

166
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,520

174
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,720
{\an8}@作家喬·鮑爾斯 就是個該死的賤逼

175
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,400
是這樣
So...

176
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,240
我在搜集過去48小時內所有針對
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers

177
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,280
喬·鮑爾斯的威脅和辱罵
over the previous 48 hours.

178
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,120
就算是丈夫  那也只是巧合吧
Say it is the husband. That's a coincidence, isn't it?

179
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,220
不見得  人人都問候你全家八輩
Not really. You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

180
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,010
這兩口子承擔的壓力肯定爆表了
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.

181
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,890
這種網絡熱點和天氣一樣  熱一陣就過去了
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.

182
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,360
就是嘴上噴噴  不是當真的
It's half hate. They don't mean it.

183
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,030
但是婚姻中的仇恨  那可是立體真實的
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

184
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,770
是投入了心思的  是發自內心的
That's had work put into it. That's sincere.

185
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,030
怎么了  我離過婚
Yeah. I'm divorced.

186
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,680
丈夫醒了  開口說話了
Husband's up and talking.

187
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,630
你肯定喜歡他的不在場證詞
You're gonna love his alibi.

188
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:20,280
{\an8}圣哥倫布醫院

189
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,160
我聽見喬在樓上慘叫
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

190
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,800
我跑進去后就看見她滿屋子亂跑亂撞
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.

191
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,050
她在抓什么
She was clutching...

192
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
她在撓她的頭  似乎她非常痛苦
She... was clutching her head as if she was in pain.

193
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,960
然后突然之間  她停下了
And then for a moment, she stopped.

194
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,580
就像抽搐了似的  她就那么
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

195
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,060
使勁抽
thrashing...

196
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,530
使勁撓自己
clawing at her own skin.

197
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,600
然后她就去
And she turned...

198
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,430
她就拿自己的頭
She smashed her head...

199
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,520
往桌子上使勁撞
onto the desk, hard.

200
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,040
然后  她推開我
Then she...  she pushed me over.

201
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,820
酒瓶子肯定就是在那時撞碎了
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

202
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,240
然后她撿起碎片  開始割自己
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.

203
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,440
割這里  往這里鑿
Here. She was gouging.

204
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,600
我試著攔住她
I tried to stop her.

205
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,290
但是她捅了我
But she did this.

206
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,900
然后她就割了自己的喉嚨
Then she cut her throat.

207
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,070
我想阻止她
I tried to stop her.

208
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,800
她用碎玻璃割了自己的喉嚨
She cut her own throat with the glass!

209
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,310
自殘加自殺  卻沒有明顯的原因
Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?

210
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,450
要我說這不太可能
I'd say the odds are against that.

211
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,510
他說她好像在抽搐
He said it was like she was having a seizure.

212
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,010
也許是蛋糕里放了什么
Maybe there was something in the cake.

213
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,490
-蛋糕  -就是上面寫著"臭婊子"的那個
- The cake? - It had "Fucking bitch" iced on it.

214
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,560
-也許里面加了什么東西  -毒品嗎
- Could've been something in it. - Like a drug?

215
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,020
-我不知道  -讓人自殺的毒品
- I don't know. - That makes people kill themselves?

216
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,750
他說得有幾分可信
He was sort of convincing.

217
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,990
-他實在不像是那種  -別說什么這種那種
- He just doesn't seem the...  - Don't say "The type."

218
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,000
他是個正常人  就是這種人
He's ordinary. That is the type.

219
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,860
怎么  那是他拿她的頭撞桌子
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

220
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,990
-布藍  -是他緊抓著她...
- Blue. - Held her steady enough--

221
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,470
-布藍  -怎么了
- Blue. - What?

222
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,350
-毒理科正在檢測蛋糕  -好吧
- Toxicology are looking at the cake. - Okay.

223
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,120
與此同時我們去拜訪下送蛋糕的人
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.

224
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,110
今早剛剛查到的
Got the name this morning.

225
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,190
-你不用哄著我  -這不是你想查的嗎
- You don't need to patronize me. - We're doing what you want.

226
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,800
-調查另一個線索  -但你認為是浪費時間
- Following another lead. - That you think is a waste of time.

227
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,380
大多數時候我們的工作就是去調查死胡同
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends,

228
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,470
好證明它們的確是死胡同
that's most of the job.

229
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,610
我沒說那是在浪費時間
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.

230
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,000
只是你還沒對現實感到厭倦
Just you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.

231
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,770
好吧  我是在哄你
Okay, that was patronizing.

232
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,520
這是送蛋糕的那個人嗎
Is this who sent the cake?

233
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,160
{\an8}莉莎·巴哈  女

234
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,590
-我們查過她的社交信息了嗎  -我不知道
- Have we checked her social feeds? - I don't know.

她星期一早上發的
She posted that on Monday morning.

240
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,140
蛋糕店說他們不寫這種臟話
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities,

241
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,020
所以我說那是給我妹妹的  開個玩笑而已
so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing,

242
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,880
他們就同意了
and they agreed, so...

243
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,050
他們家的蛋糕不便宜啊
Not cheap, their cakes.

244
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,870
加上外送費  有80英鎊吧
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

245
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,350
不全是我付的錢
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

246
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,990
-我們每個人出了一英鎊  -我們
- We all put a pound in each. - We?

247
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,300
對  我上一個媽媽和看護留言板
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers message board.

248
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,050
我做了個募捐
I held a sort of whip-round.

249
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,590
-你眾籌的錢  -對  可以這么說
- You crowd-sourced the money? - Yeah, if you like.

250
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,420
有另外80個人捐錢
From 80 other people?

251
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,250
聽著  我沒有
Look, I'm not...

252
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,440
我沒有開玩笑  好嗎  我知道她死了
I'm not being funny, okay? I know she is dead.

253
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,280
但是你讀過她寫的文章嗎
But did you read what she had written?

254
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
你覺得她寫那種東西
How much do you think she got paid

255
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,820
掙了多少錢
for spouting that horrible shit?

256
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,860
我不知道
I don't know.

257
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,000
我只是使用了我言論自由權
I was just using my freedom of speech.

258
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,310
來發恐嚇信息
To send a threatening message.

259
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,240
聽著
Look.

260
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,100
那樣就是好玩  行嗎
It was funny, okay?

261
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,880
我明白如果是我一個人做的
And I can see if I'd done it myself,

262
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,130
是會有點奇怪
then that would be a bit weird,

263
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,840
但我不是瘋子
but I'm not mental.

264
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,990
你希望她死掉
You wished she was dead.

265
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,430
不  我沒有
No, no, I didn't.

"喬·鮑爾斯去死"
"Death to Jo Powers."

267
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,870
那只不過是...
That's just...

268
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,000
標簽游戲  比如"誰誰誰去死"
It's a-- a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."

269
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,090
你附上某個犯渾的人的名字
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.

270
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,460
那不是認真的  就是個玩笑
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

271
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,650
誰發起的那個標簽
And who started it? The hashtag?

272
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,140
我不知道  我就是在哪看到的
I don't know. I don't know. I saw it somewhere.

273
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,030

Excuse us a moment.

274
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,290
毒理科說蛋糕沒問題
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

275
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,850
他們還說  "謝謝  蛋糕很美味"
They also said: "Thanks, it was delicious."

276
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,770
我們按照《攻擊言論法》給她個警告
We'll give her a caution. Offensive Communications Act.

277
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,010
-蛋糕上的話也算嗎  -就她而言  算
- Does that cover cakes? - As far as she's concerned, it does.

278
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
那其他捐了錢的人呢
What about the others who chipped in?

279
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,710
你也要去責備他們嗎
Are you going to tell them off, too?

280
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,730
-我什么都沒做  -去網上留言吧
- I didn't do anything. - Start a thread about it.

281

Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.

Don't wallow in that.

網民今天就會換個對象發火
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.

Everyone's pissed off with Tusk

289

cause of that thing with the kid.

-你還吸這個  -好東西  哥們
- What you smoking? - Good shit, boy.

A'ight.

Damn.

304

Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,360
別緊張  在這里是合法的
Don't stress. It's legal here.

306
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,310
我總是忘  歡迎來到歐洲
Keep forgetting. Welcome to Europe, I guess.

307
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,230
-還有點失去樂趣了  -這還用說
- Kinda takes the joy out of it. - Tell me about it.

308
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,740
小心點  摔壞了要你賠
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

309
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,010
總是添亂
Always doing some bullshit.

310
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,920
塔斯克  塔斯克
Tusk? Tusk?

311
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,360
這里需要幫忙
We need some help over here!

312
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,230
-我在這兒呢  -讓它出去  讓它出去
- I got you. - Get it out! Get it out!

313
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,900
讓它出去
Get it out!

314
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,740
叫救護車
Call an ambulance!

315
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,080
開始
Commencing.

316
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,300
-他說是什么事了嗎  -沒有
- Did he say what it is? - Nope.

317
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,610
{\an8}第三天

318
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,960
-早上好  -早
- Good morning. - Morning.

319
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,230
她在里面
She's in here.

320
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,740
我查看了大腦內部
So I go in,

321
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,850
不只有玻璃造成的創傷
and there's not just the wound from the glass.

322
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,040
有一個洞
There's a hole.

323
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,050
鉆出來的洞  像個小隧道一樣
Dug in. A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

324
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,710
所以我順著往里看  看它有多深
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?

325
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,370
從耳道一直到大腦深處
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.

326
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,120
然后我找到了這個
Where I find this.

327
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,370
就待在那里  看起來挺安逸的
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

328
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,230
-這是那種什么蜜蜂  -人造蜂
- It's one of those bee things. - An ADI.

329
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,140
顆粒計劃研制的自主昆蟲
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.

330
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,850
-它怎么進去的  -我認為是打洞進去的
- How did it get in there? - I'd say it burrowed in.

331
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,880
-操  -這還不是最糟糕的
- Fuck me. - That's not the worst part.

332
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,910
它正好爬到她的腦島背后側
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula,

333
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,180
也就是大腦的痛覺中樞
which is basically the brain's pain centre.

334
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,780
那是極度的痛苦
You're talking agony off the scale.

335
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,660
你會不惜一切地讓它停下
You'd do anything to make it stop.

336
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,120
甚至割自己的喉嚨
Even cut your own throat.

337
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,180
-下午好  -帕克總督察
- Good afternoon. - DCI Parke.

338
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,050
-見習警官布藍·科爾森  -謝謝
- TDC Blue Colson. - Okay. Thank you.

339
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,300
這些公司都太他媽華麗了
They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.

340
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,160
-用數十億打造品牌  -他們付得起
- Billions on branding. - Well, they can afford it.

341
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,070
整個人造蜂工程基本上是政府資助的
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.

342
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,110
所以有那么多人對此很擔憂
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.

343
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,470
我猜猜  是互聯網上的一些人
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?

344
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,070
他們認為政府用這些蜜蜂監視我們
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.

345
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,200
真是精神分裂的世界觀啊
There's a schizophrenic world view.

346
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,700
天啊
Jesus,

347
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,230
我從沒指望能活在未來
I didn't expect to find myself living in the future,

348
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,120
但是我現在就處在未來
but here I fucking well am.

349
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,600
卡琳·帕克
Karin Parke?

350
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,930
溫妮莎·達爾
Vanessa Dahl.

351
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,130
請跟我來
Please. Follow me.

352
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,410
你們想了解人造蜂群工程的信息嗎
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?

353
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,780
沒錯
That's right.

354
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,790
有什么原因嗎
Any particular reason?

355
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,160
有
Yes.

356
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,050
拉斯姆斯
Rasmus.

357
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,560
拉斯姆斯·斯約博格
Rasmus Sjoberg.

358
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,790
他是蜂群工程的帶頭人
He heads Swarm.

359
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,830
很高興認識你們
Nice to meet you.

360
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,370
-不錯的溫室  -是啊
- Nice greenhouse. - Yeah.

361
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,790
那么  你的蜜蜂  人造蜂  跟我說說
So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.

362
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,660
蜂群崩壞綜合癥  我們仍然不了解背后的原因
Colony Collapse Disorder. We still don't know what's behind it.

363
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,250
蜜蜂差不多已經滅絕了
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so

364
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,770
所以我們的人造蜂相當于替代了它們
what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.

365
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,760
它們是太陽能驅動的  不用采蜜
They're solar powered. They don't need nectar.

366
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,680
但是它們同樣會給花傳粉
but they pollinate flowers the same way.

367
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,840
它們爬進去  花粉會粘在它們腿上
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs

368
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,970
然后沾在下一朵花上
and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.

369
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,240
它們能產蜜嗎
Can they make honey?

370
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,860
不能
No.

371
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,450
我只是開玩笑
I was joking.

372
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,470
它們怎么知道花在哪
How do they know where the flowers even are? I mean...

373
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,150
它們有傳感器
Well, they have a sensor.

374
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,170
像是  攝像頭
Like a... camera?

375
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,400
不是  只是基礎的視覺傳感器
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

376
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,180
它們需要基本的模式識別系統
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition

377
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,110
才能定位相同的植物群并進行導航
in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.

378
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,330
-它們能導航  -是的
- They navigate? - Yes.

379
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,610
你不用
You don't... I don't know...

380
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
操控它們嗎
steer them?

381
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,670
它們是自主行動的  對吧
They're autonomous. That's right, isn't it?

382
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,510
它們自己做決定  自己照顧自己
They make their own decisions. They look after themselves.

383
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,690
對  人造蜂覆蓋整個英國
Yes. You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.

384
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,290
我們不可能分別控制每只蜂
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.

385
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,050
在邏輯上不可能
It's just not logistically possible.

386
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,160
是的  我們只是設定行為讓它們自己行動
No. We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.

387
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,390
它們甚至自己建造蜂巢
They even construct these hives themselves.

388
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,060
它們繁殖
They reproduce...

389
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,640
-繁殖  -是的
- They reproduce? - Yes.

390
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,020
每個蜂巢都有個復制點
Each hive is a replication point.

391
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,460
-就像3D打印機  -沒錯
- It's like a 3D printer, basically. - Exactly.

392
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,960
它們創造自己的復制品
They create duplicates of themselves,

393
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,920
建造更多的蜂巢  以指數級擴張
create more hives and spread out exponentially.

394
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,600
-覆蓋全國  -也許你應該來這兒工作
- Cover the country. - Maybe you should work here.

395
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,430
是啊  我研究過這個
Yeah, well, I read up on it.

396
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,660
很了不起
It's impressive.

397
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,840
是啊
It is.

398
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,300
但要靠這種辦法真是遺憾
It's just a shame it's necessary.

399
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,950
沒有它們就會導致環境災難
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.

400
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,530
蜜蜂在滅亡
Bees were dying out.

401
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,990
所以  你們前來所為何事
So, what is it that brings you here?

402
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,470
我們認為你們的一只人造蜂
We think one of your ADIs

403
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,020
可能涉及一起不明死亡
may be involved in an unexplained death.

404
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,580
什么  死亡
Sorry? A death?

405
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,270
謝謝
Thank you.

找到了控制它們的方式呢
and then they found a way of controlling it?

415
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,220
不可能
That's impossible.

416
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,270
它們的加密是軍用級別的
You see, it's got military-grade encryption,

417
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,140
你還需要一個診斷控制器
and you would need a diagnostic controller,

418
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,410
那也是加密的
which is also encrypted.

419
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,200
所以我看那種可能性...
So I would say the likelihood is--

How many bees per hive?

426
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,530
大約四千只
Around 4,000.

427
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,900
-就像空中管制  -沒錯
- It's like air traffic control. - Yeah.

428
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,770
那是搜索框嗎
Is that the search input?

429
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,360
是的  但是
Yeah, but, uh...

430
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,840
-抱歉  -你需要
- Sorry. - you'd need...

431
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,350
喬·鮑爾斯的郵編
Jo Powers' postcode.

432
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,740
是為了她嗎
Is that who this is about?

433
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,830
-你說會出現故障  -很少  沒錯
- You said you get some malfunctions? - A fair few, yes.

434
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,140
撞上車或是什么的  還有人捕捉它們
They smack into a car or something. We even had people trap them.

435
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,030
把它們放進微波爐里  拍視頻上傳
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos.

436
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,820
這個會記錄所有掉線的人造蜂
And this logs any that drop off the system?

437
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,080
記錄一切  沒錯
Logs everything, yes.

438
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,290
你們星期一晚上在這附近有人造蜂掉線嗎
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?

439
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,980
我可以查一下
Well, I can check.

440
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,510
只有一只  19:03時放出
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.

441
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,830
我可以重放
Here, I can replay.

442
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,900
在那兒
There.

443
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,840
很奇怪
That's odd.

444
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,990
怎么奇怪了
What's odd?

445
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,910
它們進入新蜂巢時
When they pass between hives,

446
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,430
會進行管轄權交接
they switch from one jurisdiction to another.

447
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,640
這就像...
It's, you know, like a...

448
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,540
電話信號發射塔間的電話嗎
It's like a phone between cell masts?

449
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,370
沒錯  它正打算這么做
Exactly. It tried to do that,

450
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,780
但并沒有東西接收它
but there was nothing to switch to.

451
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,470
除非有人仿造了一個蜂巢
Unless someone spoofed a hive

452
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,080
他們用這個方法黑了你們的人造蜂
and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

453
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,990
不會  那還得需要診斷控制器
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.

454
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,570
一個控制器的控制范圍是多大
What's the range on one of those?

455
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,980
可能有10到20米
10, 20 metres, perhaps.

456
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
這么說控制這個的人
So whoever was controlling

457
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,850
就在20米的范圍內
it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.

458
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,980
在房子外面
Outside the house.

459
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,240
是的  可能甚至坐在輛車里
Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

460
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,470
你能查到這是誰干的嗎
Can you trace back who did this?

461
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,110
可以  已經開始查了
Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

462
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,450
知道嗎
You know what?

463
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,790
沒人旁觀的話會查得更快
It would be easier without an audience.

464
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,290
好
Okay.

465
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,540
你們倆交換下電話號碼  保持聯系
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.

466
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,420
如果必要的話  你能把整個系統關閉嗎
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be...

467
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,060
只是假設
Hypothetically speaking?

468
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,910
短暫的停工都會破壞生態系統
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem,

469
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,840
我們需要得到環保局的批準
and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.

470
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,470
我們需要顆粒計劃中
We'll need a list of any

471
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,140
所有有權限進入系統的人員名單
Granular staff that had access to that system,

472
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,320
在職和已離職的都要
past or present.

473
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,360
有些是政府雇員
Some were government employees.

474
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,870
可以的話  用不一樣的字體把他們標出來

475
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,900
再見
Bye.

476
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,840
尼克  這是顆粒計劃的員工資料
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.

477
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,130
找出任何有嫌疑的人
Root out anyone interesting.

478
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,920
可能不是一個人  可能是團伙作案
Maybe not just one. Could be a group involved.

479
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,180
-那個  -我們其實該把這個上報給國家犯罪局
- Listen. - Technically we should refer this up to the NCA,

480
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,940
但他們休想從我手里奪走這個案子
but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.

481
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,620
國家犯罪局已經知道了
The NCA already knows about it.

482
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,420
什么
What?

483
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,900
卡琳·帕克總督察
DCI Karin Parke?

484
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,190
-是的  -肖恩·李  國家犯罪局
- Yes. - Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

485
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,060
什么風把你給吹來了
How come you're here?

486
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,570
不止一起
There's been more than one.

487
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,500
這是塔斯克  昨晚的事
This is Tusk, last night.

488
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,640
-媽的  -他們本以為是痙攣
- Shit. - They thought it was a fit.

489
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,880
把他帶到醫院
Took him to the hospital.

490
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,020
為阻止他自殘  不得不給他打了麻醉
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.

491
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,980
X光顯示
X-ray seemed to indicate

492
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,310
他大腦里有斑塊或是腫瘤
some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain

493
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,450
于是他們給他做了核磁共振
so they popped him in the MRI.

494
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,090
是啊
Yeah.

495
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,100
就是一個大磁鐵
Basically one big magnet.

496
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,500
把這個從他腦袋里拉了出來  從眼窩中
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.

497
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,920
人造蜂也損壞了
Battered the ADI too.

498
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,800
你們的那只更為完整
Yours is more intact

499
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,830
我需要拿去作分析
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

500
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,970
這是證據
It's evidence.

501
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,450
兩起案子就形成規律了
Two's a pattern.

502
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,960
那就不是故障了
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.

503
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,910
兩名被害人有相似特征
And they're similar victims.

504
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,010
相似特征
Similar?

505
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,290
都是正在被網絡聲討的人
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

506
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,860
如果你想殺掉一個人
Well, if you wanna kill someone,

507
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,790
更簡單的方法數不勝數
there's a million easier ways to do it.

508
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,910
這種方法  你隔著條街就可以下手
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.

509
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,640
不會留下指紋和DNA
No fingerprints, no DNA.

510
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,480
就好像把他們咒死了
It's like wishing them dead.

511
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,290
操
Fuck.

512
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,280
操
Fuck.

513
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,840
各位  快過來
Guys? Come here.

514
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,160
那么...
Okay, so, um...

515
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,440
喬·鮑爾斯和塔斯克
Jo Powers and Tusk,

516
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,510
兩人都在網上被人罵了很久
both were being kicked around the Internet for hours,

517
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,160
但在兩人的案子中  人們發照片時
but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos

518
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,120
還會加上這個標簽#去死
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

519
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
{\an8}塔斯克#去死

520
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,360
-就像那個老師一樣  -對
- Like our friend the teacher. - Right.

521
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,920
她不知道她最初是什么時候聽說的
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it,

522
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,230
但回溯一下
but trace it back,

523
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,140
這個標簽似乎是上周末才出現的
and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.

524
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,200
誰用的
By who?

525
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,140
看起來...
Looks like, um...

526
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,470
似乎是一批僵尸號發了同樣的推文
looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

527
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,720
是自動的
Automated.

528
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,850
就像垃圾郵件
It's like spam.

529
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,420
有人想推廣這個標簽
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?

530
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,500
傳出去  就像個誘餌
Get it out there. It's like bait.

531
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,540
有人想讓大家都開始用它
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.

532
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,160
看看發推者的頭像
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

533
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,020
蜜蜂  見鬼
Bees. Shit.

534
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,580
好吧
Okay.

535
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,910
不止如此
There's more.

536
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,050
每條推文都附有一段說明視頻
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.

537
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,010
{\an8}后果游戲

538
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,570
看
There.

539
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,220
"后果游戲"
"Game of Consequences"?

540
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,560
像是一場不受歡迎度比賽
It's like an unpopularity contest.

541
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,150
選個你不喜歡的人
Pick someone you don't like

542
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,780
如果選他的人足夠多
and if enough other people choose the same name,

543
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,250
那他就成了目標
then that's who gets targeted.

544
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,160
看
Here, watch.

545
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,800
后果游戲
Game of Consequences.

546
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,670
{\an8}#去死

547
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,990
-第一步  選擇目標  -天啊
- One, pick a target. - Oh, my God.

548
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,670
第二步  發布他們的名字和照片
Two, post their name and photo

549
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,610
加上標簽#去死
with #DeathTo.

550
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,430
不
No.

551
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,470
第三步  人氣最高的目標
Three, most popular target

552
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,450
會在每天晚五點后被除掉
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.

553
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,520
第四步  游戲在午夜時重置
Four, game resets at midnight.

554
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,680
-不  -操
- Oh, no. - Fuck.

555
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,580
{\an8}#去死

556
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,850
有人在操控公眾投票  除掉得票最高的人
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.

557
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,480
天啊  簡直瘋了
Jesus, it's just mad.

558
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,160
是啊  而且在蔓延
Yeah, and it's growing.

559
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,300
第一天  63人給喬·鮑爾斯加了這個標簽
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?

560
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,370
第二天  223人給塔斯克加了這標簽
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

561
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,970
-現在還有誰在發標簽  -比之前多太多了
- Who's using it now? - There's-- there's loads more people.

562
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,670
有不少人給財相加了標簽
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.

563
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,540
是啊
Yeah.

564
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,070
但第一名
But at number one...

565
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,640
880人給克拉拉·米茲加了標簽
is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.

566
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,720
-她是誰  -克拉拉·米茲
- Who's she? - Clara Meades.

567
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,860
好
Okay, um...

568
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,970
她似乎是參加了一個示威游行
it looks like she was at a demo,

569
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,920
她在戰爭紀念碑前拍了張自拍
and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.

570
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,440
假裝沖上面尿尿
Pretending to piss on it.

571
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,920
干得好  克拉拉
Nice work, Clara.

572
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,420
投票快結束了
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote,

573
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,130
提到她的人數還在爆長
and her mentions are blowing up.

574
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,390
-塔斯克案還沒公開吧  -沒有
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet? - Um, no.

575
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,820
人們不知道標簽真好用
So people can't know the hashtag works.

576
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,270
他們是想用它嚇唬她
They're using it to scare her.

577
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,090
對  但他們會害死她的
Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.

578
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,220
我們得在五點前找到她
We need to get to her before five.

579
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,660
嗯  正在調出她的個人信息
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

580
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,970
你不應該有那個的權限
You're not supposed to have access to that.

581
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,610
我知道  我只想獲取她的位置
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

582
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,180
{\an8}克拉拉·米茲

584
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:24,850
{\an8}@克拉拉·米茲 你大限將至  會讓你措手不及  膽顫吧

586
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,120
{\an8}史上最爛的垃圾  克拉拉·米茲#去死

585
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,120
{\an8}太放肆  臭不要臉@克拉拉·米茲

587
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,860
{\an8}克拉拉·米茲#去死

588
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,860
{\an8}@克拉拉·米茲 什么鬼

589
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,820
{\an8}他們為你的自由才犧牲

590
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,420
{\an8}去你媽@克拉拉·米茲 講真  #滾粗

591
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,940
{\an8}講真  有些人真該...

592
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,870
喂
Hello?

593
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,460
她在
Yeah, she is.

594
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,100
好  稍等別掛
All right, all right, hold on.

595
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,150
克拉拉
Clara!

596
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,770
警察  找你的
Police. For you.

597
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,520
他們怎么知道我電話的
How did they get my number?

598
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,000
-喂  -克拉拉·米茲
- Hello? - Clara Meades?

599
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,720
我是倫敦警局的卡琳·帕克總督察
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

600
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,070
抱歉用這種方式找到你
Sorry to track you down like this,

601
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,490
但我們認為你有危險
but we think you may be in danger.

602
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,820
抱歉  這是惡作劇嗎
Sorry, is this a joke?

603
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,710
因為我收到的這些消息可不好玩
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

604
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,710
不是惡作劇  待在原地  我們過去找你
I'm not joking. Stay where you are until we get there.

605
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,790
關好窗戶
And keep your windows closed.

606
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,750
我設置了警戒線
I'm setting up a perimeter.

607
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,210
打給拉斯姆斯  我們需要他的協助
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

608
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,180
-拉斯姆斯  -你好  布藍
- Rasmus? - Hi, Blue.

609
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,490
我發了你一個郵編和我的位置
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.

610
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,140
你得監控這一地區
I need you to monitor the area.

611
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,750
追蹤我的位置  看是否有異常情況
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual,

612
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,620
是否有失靈的人造蜂
any rogue ADIs, yeah?

613
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,630
好的
Yeah, great, good.

614
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,850
如果他們故伎重施
Look, if they come back,

615
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,260
我應該能抓住他們
I think I can catch them.

616
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,200
我已經布下了陷阱
I have basically set a trap.

617
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,690
他們要是再這么做  我們能抓到他們
So if they-- if they try it again, we've got them.

618
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,610
-你是蝙蝠俠嗎  -這是新產品
- Are you Batman? - They only just rolled them out.

619
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,820
這能讓途中所有紅燈都變綠
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.

620
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,070
我操  要是國家犯罪局要這么牛
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,

621
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,530
我應該申請調職
I should apply for a transfer.

622
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,330
走吧
Let's go.

623
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,630
我們可以帶她去這里
We can take her here.

624
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,260
是給恐怖分子線人準備的安全屋
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.

625
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,480
沒看到目標
No target sighted.

626
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,400
這是警方行動
This is a police operation!

627
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,890
請所有人立即疏散
Everybody vacate their premises now.

628
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,480
請疏散...
Please leave...

629
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,690
{\an8}檢測到入侵

630
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,950
-怎么了  -有人想入侵
- What's that? - Someone's trying to break in.

631
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,840
-拉斯姆斯  -我發現有人試圖入侵
- Rasmus? - I just picked up an attempted breach.

632
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,950
好  顆粒計劃那邊發現入侵
Okay. Granular, they've got a breach.

633
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,620
-一只人造蜂剛剛掉線了  -哪里
- One ADI just went offline. - Where?

634
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,470
-距你們800米  -在我們的警戒帶之外
- 800 metres from your location. - That's outside our cordon.

635
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,270
如果有人想讓人造蜂朝這邊飛
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

636
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,460
他們一看到警察就會讓它調頭
they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.

637
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,860
-克拉拉·米茲  -是我
- Clara Meades? - Yeah.

638
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,040
我是卡琳·帕克  你收拾行李了嗎
I'm Karin Parke. Did you pack a bag?

639
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,960
-收拾了  放在門邊  -好  走吧
- Yeah, it's by the door. - Right, let's go.

640
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,610
-拉斯姆斯追蹤到他們了嗎  -還沒
- Rasmus got a track on them? - Not yet.

641
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,570
{\an8}追蹤中

642
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,520
只是以防萬一  住一晚而已
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.

643
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,950
我上報一下
Just gotta call in.

644
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,570
還沒
No, not yet.

645
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,960
希望永遠都別  顆粒計劃在查
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

646
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,480
明白
Understood.

647
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,790
肖恩說  曾有個線人在這兒住過
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.

648
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,600
肯定有孩子
Must've had kids.

649
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,590
你有孩子嗎
Have you got kids?

650
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,500
-沒有  -沒有
- No. - No.

651
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:11,890
沒這個打算
No plans.

652
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,630
上樓吧
Up the stairs.

653
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:39,990
拉斯姆斯
Rasmus.

654
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,200
依然沒進展  我無法追蹤
Still nothing. I can't trace it.

655
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,370
至少還有間套房
At least there's an en-suite.

656
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,090
-什么都沒有  -對
- Is there nothing? - No.

657
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,080
干這事的人把蹤跡掩蓋得很好
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.

658
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,020
但那不是...
But that's not--

659
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,290
-操  -怎么了
- Fuck. - What?

660
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,130
-我們失去了一個蜂巢  -什么意思
- We just lost a whole hive. - What does that mean?

661
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,810
里面滿是人造蜂
Packed full of ADIs.

662
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,220
全都失聯了
Lost them all too.

663
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,210
-不  拉斯姆斯  -有數千只
- No-- Rasmus? - There's thousands of them.

664
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,170
-在哪  -離你們很近
- Where? - It's close to your location.

665
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,300
拉斯姆斯  再說一遍
Rasmus, say that again.

666
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,160
布藍  布藍  離你們非常近
Blue? Blue. It's close... it's very close to you.

667
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:38,800
發短信  給我發短信
Text it. Text it to me.

668
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,480
拉斯姆斯  短信  操
Rasmus. Text it to-- Shit.

669
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,650
我能重新裝修嗎
Do I get to redecorate?

670
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,670
喂  喂
Hello. Hello.

671
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,820
不...
No...

672
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,350
他們控制了一切
They've got the whole thing.

673
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,570
我們不能控制了
We're not in control anymore.

674
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,170
-他們控制了一切  -你在干什么
- They've got the whole thing. - What are you doing?

675
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,420
修好它
Fix it!

676
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,070
-你修不好嗎  -閉嘴
- Can't you fix it? - Shut up!

677
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,700
{\an8}拉斯姆斯·斯約博格  快跑

678
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,030
操
Shit.

679
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,420
我們得走了  快  快走
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

680
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,420
跑  跑  跑
Go. Go, go, go.

681
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,250
怎么回事
What's-- what's happening?

682
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,900
卡琳
Karin...

683
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,770
進去  快走
In there! Go!

684
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,750
-幫我堵住門縫  -這是怎么了
- Help me block the gap! - Tell me what's going on!

685
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,640
你們要嚇死我了
You're scaring the shit out of me!

686
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,400
操
Fuck!

687
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,020
換氣扇  換氣扇
The fan! The fan!

688
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,020
離我遠點
Get it away from me!

689
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,060
慢慢來
Take your time.

690
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,950
我見過那么多尸體
I'd seen so many bodies before.

691
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,550
在犯罪現場  在尸檢時
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

692
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,250
但我從沒見過人死的過程
But I'd never seen anyone die.

693
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,440
她就在我面前
And she was right there.

694
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,940
你能形容下你同事  科爾森小姐的反應嗎
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?

695
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,180
布藍很受打擊
Blue took it hard.

696
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:44,900
我會關停它
I'll shut it down.

697
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,170
我們原以為  附近有一個神秘人士
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

698
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,090
劫持并控制了一只人造蜂
hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.

699
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,710
但剛剛有成百上千只
But there were thousands of them.

700
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,700
-所以不可能是一個人  -對
- So it can't be that, right? - No.

701
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
-一個人不能同時控制那么多蜜蜂  -對
- One person can't fly hundreds at once. - No.

702
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,140
不管是誰  他們控制了整個系統
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.

703
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,440
你知道他們是從什么地方控制的嗎
Do you know where they're controlling it from?

704
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,610
不知道  哪都有可能
No. Could be anywhere.

705
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,650
你他媽得搞明白這件事
You need to fucking sort this out!

706
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,580
人造蜂怎么知道目標是誰
How do the ADIs know who to target?

707
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:38,540
可能跟你用的是一種方法  通過身份數據庫
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?

708
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,460
不  那只能找到大致區域
No. That just gives you the basic area.

709
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,170
當時我們也在房間里  但它們只叮她
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.

710
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,990
面部識別  肯定是面部識別
Facial recognition. It's got to be facial recognition.

711
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,190
也就是說視覺傳感器的信號
Which means the feed from their visual sensors,

712
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,210
也被入侵了
that's been accessed too.

713
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,990
-不可能  -這是唯一的解釋
- That's not possible. - It's the only explanation.

714
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,750
每只人造蜂和蜂巢
Now look, the visual feed

715
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,180
之間的視覺信號都是加密的
is secure between each ADI and the hive.

716
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,710
-是了吧  -不過
- There you go. - Although...

717
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,950
政府支持計劃的條件之一就是...
one of the government's conditions for backing the project...

718
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,480
好了  夠了
Okay. Enough.

719
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,470
我們得同意  在政府安全機構需要時
We had to consent to permitting government security services

720
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,770
給他們視覺信號
access to the visual feed at times of quote,

721
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,520
以"加強國家安全"
"Increased national security."

722
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,140
就我理解  幾乎就是隨時
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.

723
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,800
-我并不高興  -你們同意了
- I wasn't happy about it. - Your lot went along with it.

724
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,270
你們并沒有給我們多少選擇
What that implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.

725
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,840
-那他們的確在監視我們  -這都是機密
- So they are spying on us. - This is all classified.

726
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,640
那你做了什么
So what did you do,

727
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,570
給政府通信總部開了一道后門嗎
did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?

728
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,390
你能拿到監控  能控制交通燈
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

729
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,580
你還有什么事是沒插手的
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?

730
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,900
外面有幾百萬個這玩意到處飛
Look, millions of those things flying around,

731
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,200
支撐著我們的生態系統
propping up the ecosystem?

732
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,260
太好了  拯救地球  皆大歡喜
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!

733
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,200
政府不會因為某個實驗室人員的三言兩語
Government's not going to pump billions into it

734
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,740
和200張贊成票  就投上幾十億
just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.

735
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,500
他們看到了可利用的機會  就把握住了
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.

736
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,810
全國性監控
Total nationwide surveillance.

737
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,440
我們能連續數周以嫌犯根本想不到的方式追蹤他們
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.

738
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,340
我們阻止爆炸  大規模槍殺
We prevented bombings, mass shootings.

739
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,160
通過監視大眾
By spying on the public.

740
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,300
并保證他們的安全  這才是他們想要的
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.

741
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,460
但是克拉拉·米茲并不安全  對嗎  肖恩
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?

742
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,970
你要是早告訴了我們  也許本可以幫上忙
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us,

743
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,220
-但你沒有  你偏要保守你的秘密  -好了
- but no, you kept your little fucking secret. - Okay.

744
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,060
好了  政府是個混蛋
Okay! The government's a cunt.

745
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,460
這我們早就知道了
We knew that already.

746
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,950
克拉拉的事很快就會傳開
Word's going to get out about Clara.

747
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,070
人們一大早醒來
The public's going to wake up

748
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:24,040
就會得知這個瘋狂的暗殺游戲
and find this mental assassination game going on,

749
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,430
很快就會出現下一具尸體
and soon we're going to have another body.

750
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,980
-那我們怎么辦  -我不知道
- So what do we do? - I don't know.

751
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,630
我們完全被墻了  什么都看不到
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

752
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,450
要是我能知道他們是怎么入侵的
If I can work out how they got in,

753
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,930
我也許能逆向工程
I might be able to reverse engineer

754
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,330
想辦法奪回控制權
some means of getting control back.

755
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,170
人造蜂有命令日志或面板緩存之類的東西嗎
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?

756
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,570
-有  但都是加密的  -我需要解碼密鑰
- Yeah, but that's encrypted. - I'll need the key to that.

757
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,600
我翻閱了員工檔案  發現幾個有嫌疑的人
Been through the employee files, found some POIs.

758
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,720
把他們帶來
Bring them in.

759
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,420
你要來嗎  訊問顆粒計劃的人
Are you sitting in on these? Granular interviews?

760
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,090
我有別的事
I've got to be somewhere.

761
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,270
現在是7點15
It's 7:15.

762
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,230
{\an8}第四天

763
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,400
已經出現三起
Three deaths have now been

764
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,350
與社交網絡上一標簽有關的死亡事件
linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.

765
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:25,630
{\an8}我操  #去死 這玩意是真的嗎

{\an8}查爾斯·澤因娜#去死

770
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,770
早上好  你發過那個標簽嗎
Good morning. Have you posted the hashtag?

771
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,730
這是真的還是都市傳說
Is it real or an urban myth?

772
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,060
{\an8}#去死 是什么

773
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,550
已經有上千人參與標簽
Well, thousands have been taking part,

774
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,480
但是那些人真的罪該致死嗎
but how culpable are they?

775
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,120
有人在死去  我們想知道你的想法
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.

776

這是真的在發生的事

{\an8}評論

我就想看到她死
I am happy to see her die.

787
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,540
又不是那個標簽害死他們的
It's not the hashtag killing them.

788
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,200
{\an8}評論  不要發

789

{\an8}法林頓勛爵和所有戀童癖#去死

790
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,280
{\an8}死亡標簽投票

791
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,180
那只是個游戲
That's just a game.

792
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,800
如果你是個混蛋  你活該被羞辱
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.

793
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,820
{\an8}#去死

794

史蒂夫  五號線
Steve, line five.

796
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,640
但我想說  總有人會登上榜首
Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?

797
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,020
{\an8}羅德·法林頓#去死

798
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,800
{\an8}#去死

799
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,160
那為什么不能是
So why not make it someone,

800
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,850
{\an8}#去死

801
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:59,790
{\an8}#去死  144000條

802
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,470
罪有應得的人呢  比如種族歧視者
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.

803
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,190
{\an8}要是有人得在五點死  那不如是湯姆·皮克林#去死

804

{\an8}趕緊除掉皮克林  湯姆·皮克林#去死

805
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,590
我看到被加這個標簽的有名人  政客
With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians,

807
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,740
{\an8}這個標簽是真的嗎  #去死

806
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,740
{\an8}好消息是我們能除掉財相了  湯姆·皮克林#去死

808
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,390
誰都有
everyone.

809
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,070
{\an8}干掉那個混蛋皮克林  湯姆·皮克林#去死

810
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,320
但這不代表你要
This doesn't mean you have to

811
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,370
坐在這里鼓勵大家參與
sit there encouraging people to take part.

812
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,340
問題是  這件事已經發生了
The point is this is already happening.

813
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,070
人們知道他們都可以參與
And people know that they can jump onboard

814
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,910
因為誰都不會知道他們到底有沒有參與
because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.

815
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,090
我們先停停  看看現在的前五名
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.

816
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,700
我們之前說過  財相排在第一位
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one,

817
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,180
我希望大家好好想想
and I want us to think about that.

818
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,890
這說明全國上下的選擇是什么
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?

819
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,880
{\an8}班森·帕克·布朗  法林頓勛爵  夏洛特·沃克  詹姆斯  湯姆·皮克林

820
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:27,350
我對他占據榜首并不感到驚訝
Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.

821
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,770
他早就很不受歡迎了
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.

822
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,090
但這代表他應該占據榜首嗎
But does that warrant his place on this list?

823
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,040
我是說  人們不需要想太多
I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.

824
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,010
現在他是第一位
Now that's he's number one,

825
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:39,870
這會引發更多討論  也許更多人會投票
that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.

826
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:52,470
{\an8}正在連接人造蜂HV20101752

827
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,160
謝謝你抽時間來
Thanks for your time.

828
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,310
不是嗎
No good?

829
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,460
不是
No good.

830
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,310
-聽起來很精彩  -肖恩
- Well, that's all fascinating... - Shaun.

831
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,460
-但我們什么時候能關閉一切  -湯姆
- But when do we shut it down? - Tom.

832
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,070
請原諒我對你手下
Forgive me for being sceptical

833
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,920
能力有所質疑
about your agency's basic competence.

834
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,320
-湯姆  -我現在就是砧板上的肉
- Tom. - I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

835
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,060
名單第一位  都是人民選的
Number one on the list. The people's fucking choice!

836
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,020
法林頓才排第四  他是個戀童癖
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.

837
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,200
-疑似戀童癖  -他就是  你心里清楚
- Suspected paedophile. - He did it. You know he did.

838
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,200
我們關掉一切社交網絡吧
Let's just shut it down. All social media.

839
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,170
整個該死的因特網  拔掉開關
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

840
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,580
就今天
Just for today,

841
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:04,030
至少等這位拇指姑娘麻利行動起來
at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out

842
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,530
抓到幾個人再說
and he actually catches someone.

843
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,170
我不建議關閉一切
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

844
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,810
-但還是可能做到的  -整個社交網絡
- But it's possible? We can do that? - The whole of social media?

845
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,210
-是啊  效仿朝鮮  -技術上來說可以
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it. - Well, yes, technically.

846
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,510
-好  那就關掉  -這不是個好主意
- Right, so push the off switch. - That's not a good idea.

847
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,610
-是嗎  -在我看來不是
- No? - Not in my opinion.

848
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,780
那好吧
Right, okay.

849
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,980
只不過作為目標人物  我表示異議
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

850
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:25,520
如果我們關掉  你還是第一位
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.

851
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,880
事實上你肯定是第一了
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

852
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,390
他說得對  如果繼續開著  至少還有幾小時
He's right. If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.

853
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,700
五點前什么都有可能  投票結果可能會變
Anything could happen before five o'clock. The vote might change.

854
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,930
也可能不會
Yeah, and it might not.

855
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,340
那則報道呢  檔案呢
What about that report? The archive job?

856
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:40,370
1985年  關于法林頓的備忘錄
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

857
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,690
-那件事毫無關聯  -泄露出去
- That was over an unrelated matter. - Leak it.

858
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,860
湯姆  這是抹黑
Tom, that would be a smear.

859
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,220
就是徹頭徹尾的抹黑  就是這意思
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.

860
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,900
他八十多歲了  活夠了  讓他去死吧
He's in his 80s. He's had his life. Fuck him under the bus.

861
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,580
我能提一個備選方案嗎
If I could suggest an alternative?

862
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,620
我們把你轉移到一個安全的地方
We move you to a safe location.

863
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,710
在五點之前保護好你
Have you secured before five.

864
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,220
昨晚你們這樣做很有用嘛
Worked out well for you last night.

865
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:00,900
我展示給你看
I'll show you.

866
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,940
下一個是苔絲·沃倫德  她是實習的
This next one's Tess Wallender. She was a junior.

867
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,770
所以技術水平不高
So not much in the way of technical skills.

868
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:21,050
-因為個人原因退出顆粒計劃  -神經衰弱
- Quit Granular for personal reasons. - Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

869
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:24,060
辭職前在顆粒的人事部工作
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.

870
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,560
她在網上發布了一個家伙的照片  說他騷擾她
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her,

871
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,810
發表下流的評論什么的
lewd comments or something.

872
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,420
后來發現他有學習障礙
Turned out he had a learning disability

873
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,250
所以她被罵得很慘  在...
so she caught a ton of shit on--

874
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,520
社交網絡上
On social media.

875
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,500
你好  我是卡琳·帕克總督察
Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.

876
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,390
{\an8}修復面板緩存

877
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,740
感覺好像
It was like

878
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:00,630
突然遭遇了一場狂風暴雨
having a whole weather system turn against me.

879
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,900
一條接一條的辱罵留言
Just hate message after hate message,

880
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,350
不停地發過來
around the clock, all piling on.

881
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,010
難以形容這對我造成的影響
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.

882
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,950
突然間出現了幾百萬個隱形人
Suddenly there's a million invisible people,

883
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:18,090
都在談論他們怎么怎么鄙夷我
all talking about how they despise you.

884
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,830
簡直像一種精神疾病
It's like a mental illness.

885
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,490
操
Fuck.

886
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,790
怎么了
What?

887
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,280
該死
Shit.

888
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,930
我的確犯了個錯誤
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

889
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:50,310
但是最讓我難過的是人們開心地貶低我的樣子
but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.

890
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,860
他們因此產生的快感
The casual fun they had and, um...

891
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:00,780
我只是覺得我受不了了
I just felt I couldn't go on.

892
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,690
是誰發現到了你
Who found you?

893
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,700
加內特  我的室友
Garrett, my flatmate.

894
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,670
他在我割腕五分鐘后在浴缸里發現了我
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.

895
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,630
太瘋狂了
I mean, it's crazy.

896
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,540
我當時快迷糊了  他把我拖出浴缸
I'm half-conscious. He's dragging me out of the bath,

897
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,350
我要他出去  我說"我沒穿衣服"
and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."

898
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,470
他在我手腕上綁毛巾  讓我保持清醒
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious,

899
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,860
不停撫摸我的頭發  和我說話
kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived,

900
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,660
直到救護車來
talking to me.

901
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,850
有點別扭
Sort of weird.

902
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,470
我覺得他一直對我有意思
I think he always had a thing for me.

903
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,350
我們也在同一個地方工作...很尷尬
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.

904
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,120
-他在顆粒工作  -是的  研究人造蜂
- He worked at Granular? - Yeah. On the ADI thing.

905
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,070
他可是個神童
He was a real wunderkind.

906
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,010
-特別聰明  -你剛剛說他叫什么
- Ultra-smart. - What did you say his name was?

907
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,050
加內特  加內特·斯科爾斯
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

908
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,530
加內特·斯科爾斯
Garrett Scholes.

909
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,150
我們要知道加內特在哪里...
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett--

910
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,250
斯科爾斯  我們剛要告訴你
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

911
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,830
這隱藏在喬·鮑爾斯體內人造蜂的面板緩存中
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.

912
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:19,610
-什么東西  -一份宣言  98頁的宣言
- What was? - A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

913
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,770
{\an8}后果之齒

914
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,360
看看這個  還有自拍
And check this out. There's fucking selfies in it.

915
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,020
{\an8}這不是表演

916
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,240
我們能行動了嗎
So we're good to go?

917
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,710
炸彈布置完畢
Okay, that's the charge in place.

918
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,540
好
Okay.

919
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,570
后退
Pull back.

920
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,190
準備完畢
We're all set here.

921
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,560
引爆
Detonate.

922
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,910
計劃是我們把你送到一處地堡
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker,

923
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,090
炸掉方圓十里內所有的蜂巢
knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.

924
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,010
然后呢  把我丟在那里  要多久
And, what, just leave me there? How long for?

925
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,900
這只是暫時的措施
It's a temporary measure.

926
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,300
處理掉所有蜂巢要多久
How long till you take out all the hives?

927
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:25,000
那大概有兩三萬個  起碼得要兩年
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them. That would take two years.

928
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,300
兩年  一天一名受害者
Two years, a victim a day.

929
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,450
更重要的是  環境的影響會...
More to the point, the environmental impact would--

930
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,720
去他媽的
Fuck that.

931
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,540
該死
Shit!

932
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:35,730
-怎么了  -操
- What? - Fuck!

933
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,170
后退  后退
Stay back, stay back!

934
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,590
后退
Get back!

935
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,970
快走  快走
Go, go, go! Get away!

936
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,050
上帝啊  快走
For fuck's sake, move!

937
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,650
你的后備計劃是什么
What's your Plan B?

938
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,480
{\an8}后果之齒  加內特·斯科爾斯的宣言

939
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:40,370
他是最早的員工之一  但我們沒考慮他
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.

940
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,070
他六個月前出國了
He left the country six months ago.

941
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,720
我以為我們要找的人就在附近
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.

942
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,570
追查他的行蹤  任何蛛絲馬跡都不要放過
Run a full trace on him. Everything we can find.

943
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:49,950
有創造力的瘋子  這是最糟糕的
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.

944
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:53,290
"由于技術革命
"Thanks to the technological revolution,

945
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,580
我們能夠不計較后果地表達憤怒
we have the power to rage and accuse,

946
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,130
提出控訴  抨擊他人
spout bile without consequence.

947
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:01,580
只有被迫了解技術賜予我們的力量
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us,

948
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:04,320
才能清楚個人責任..."
to acknowledge individual responsibility..."

949
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,210
都是這些東西嗎
Is it all like this?

950
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:10,620
他把人們類比為昆蟲  說我們喜歡殘酷
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty,

951
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:13,110
這是我們應該摒棄的弱點
that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.

952
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,040
他重復表示
Recurrent theme is

953
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,080
要人們面對他們的言行舉止所帶來的后果
he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.

954
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,910
強迫他們面對
Wants to force that on them.

955
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,180
這整件事就是個道德教育嗎
The whole thing's a moral lesson?

956
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,050
他希望我們發現這個  并散播出去
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.

957
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:28,230
去他媽的
Well, fuck him.

958
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,390

960
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:46,880
{\an8}這不是表演

961
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,710
我操
Fuck.

962
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,690

該死
Shit.

968
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,780
卡琳  卡琳  他搞砸了
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

969
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,280
他親自拼湊了這些文件  對吧
He's put this document together himself, right?

970
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,100
作者姓名在元數據里
His author name's in the metadata.

971
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,680
但他把其他東西都抹去了
But he stripped out everything else,

972
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,730
所以我們不知道他是什么時候寫的
so we don't know when he's written it, for example.

973
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,020
大多數照片都是從網上截取的  除了這張
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.

974
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,200
-他的自拍  -這就是他搞砸的地方
- The selfie. - That's where he's screwed up.

975
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,910
他是用自己的手機拍的
He's taken it with his phone,

976
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,940
手機在圖像上留下了地理標記
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

977
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,290
-你知道他是在哪里拍的嗎  -知道
- So you know where he took this? - I know precisely where.

978
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,700
他在這里  顆粒總部在那里
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

979
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,450
{\an8}尼克·謝爾頓  加內特·斯科爾斯#去死

980
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:50,720
-武裝警察  趴下  -武裝警察
- Armed police! Stay down! - Armed police!

981
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,970
-武裝警察  不許動  -武裝警察  出來
- Armed police! Stay where you are! - Armed police! Show yourselves!

982
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,660
過去
Move!

983
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,540
左邊
Left.

984
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,260
-安全  -安全
- Clear! - Clear!

985
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,100
安全
Clear!

986
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,480
過得像富翁和名流
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

987
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,110
那里  鍛造爐
There. The forge.

988
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,040
漂亮
Nice one.

989
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,460
我在鑒證科檢查過的半數硬盤都被燒過
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.

990
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:49,430
-你怎么看  -看起來是他的工具包
- What do you think? - Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

991
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,540
-能用嗎  -可以說是開啟大門的鑰匙
- You can use it? - Pretty much the key to the door.

992
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,940
你能奪回控制權嗎  發送失效指令
So you can get control back? Send the deactivation?

993
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:58,010
我拿到了他的源代碼
Well, I've got his source code.

994
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,810
-應該能把他弄出去  -快點
- I should be able to bounce him out. - Be quick.

995
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,160
開啟大門的鑰匙
Key to the door?

996
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,340
這人不像是會把"鑰匙"隨便亂丟的人
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.

997
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,420
我進去了
Well, I'm in.

998
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,740
好  讓它失效
Okay. Deactivate her.

999
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,690
-我得先修復權限  -該死
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions. - Fucking hell.

1000
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,590
奇怪
That's weird.

1001
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:23,290
奇怪什么
What's weird?

1002
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:26,830
-快沒時間了  -這份文件之前不在的
- Time's ticking. -That file. Wasn't there before.

1003
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,320
-這份文件嗎  -對
- This file? - Yeah.

1004
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,030
是什么
What is it?

1005
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,430
-布藍  -我覺得是國際移動設備識別碼
- Blue? - I think they're IMEI numbers.

1006
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,180
那是什么
What does that mean?

1007
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,710
每部手機  每個設備都有一個獨特的號碼
Every phone, every device has a unique number,

1008
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:50,880
也就是國際移動設備識別碼
an IMEI number.

1009
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,050
與特定的用戶綁定在一起
It tethers it to a unique user.

1010
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,500
-對  -但我能進行反向搜索
- Yeah. - But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

1011
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,420
慢慢來
Take it easy.

1012
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,160
這些人是誰
Who are these people?

1013
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,200
我不知道  一共有38.7萬人
I don't know. There's 387,000 of them.

1014
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,930
這些人是你那些間諜收集的嗎
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?

1015
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,900
-不是  你準備好了嗎  -快了
- No! Are you ready yet? - Yeah, almost there.

1016
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,850
慢著  慢著
Wait. Wait.

1017
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,750
罵人蛋糕的那個老師叫什么名字
What was the name of that teacher? Hate cake.

1018
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,290
-莉莎·巴哈  -莉莎·巴哈

1019
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,910

這是所有使用過標簽的人的名單

所有參加過"后果游戲"的人

{\an8}莉莎·巴哈

1024
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,050
看來是通過政府通信總部得到了他們的身份信息
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.

1025
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,410
那個后門看來是雙向的
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

1026
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,680
-看有沒有我  -什么
- See if I'm on there. - What?

1027
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:43,560
我早些時候加標簽發了斯科爾斯的照片
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.

1028
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,450
只是想惹他不開心
Just trying to get a reaction from him.

1029
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,260

1030
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,400
嗯  你在上邊
Yeah, you're there.

1031
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,470
{\an8}尼克·謝爾頓

1032
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,180
快好了
Almost there.

1033
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:57,450
他為什么要收集參與人的名單  畢竟
Why has he collected everyone who took part? I mean...

1034
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,930
好  準備好了
Okay. I'm ready.

1035
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,120
{\an8}關閉系統

1036
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,640
-見鬼  -馬上關閉
- Shit. - Run it now.

1037
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,700
不  想想  他留了線索給我們
No. Think. He left us a trail.

1038
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,750
-得了吧  -帶地址信息的照片
- Oh, come on. - That photo with the whereabouts,

1039

他不會犯這么大的錯誤
it's too big a mistake for him.

1040
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,220
他早知道我們會這么做
He knew we'd do this.

1041
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,980
現在我們要關閉系統了
Now we're shutting it down, all right?

1042
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,860
這或許會引發終極事件
And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

1043
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,550
和名單有關的事件
something to do with that list.

1044
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,390
萬一他們才是他真正的目標呢
What if those are his real targets?

1045
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,870

The people on the list.

承擔后果

1048
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,360
仇恨對象只是誘餌
The hate figures were the bait.

1049
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,940
玩家才是目標
The players are the target.

1050
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:41,640
-確認關閉  -稍等一會兒  好嗎
- Run the deact command. - Now just wait a minute, okay?

1051
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,440

1052
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,580

{\an8}正在處理

1056
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:47,590

-操  -抱歉  但必須這么做
- Fuck! - Sorry, but that needed doing.

1060
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,280
-不  不  不  -怎么了
- No, no, no, no, no. - What?

1061
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:17,960
不  不
No. No.

1062
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,540
-操  -不
- Fuck! - No.

1063
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,530
見鬼
Shit.

Oh, no.

1065
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,090
看啊
There's...

1066
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,190
很不幸
We're all tragically

1067
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:08,310
我們都清楚那周接下來發生的事
familiar with the rest of the events of that week.

1068
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,720
隨后的大規模死亡不需提醒
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale

1069
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,670
大家也都記得
of the loss of life that followed.

1070
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,600
對  忘不掉
No. No, we don't.

1071
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,850
科爾森女士后來如何了
And what became of Ms. Colson?

1072
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:11,450
我想她很自責
I think she blamed herself.

1073
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,350
不對  我知道她自責
No. I know she did.

1074
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:20,240
她覺得是因為自己順著他布的局走
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and

1075
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,480
才觸發了整件事
sprung the whole thing.

1076
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,600
她離開了警局
She left the force.

1077
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,620
我再沒有她的消息
I didn't hear from her.

1078
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,210
打電話  發郵件  都沒有回復
Rang her, tried E-mailing, but no response.

1079
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,280
后來
Then, um...

1080
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:49,990
大概四個月后
About four months later,

1081
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,470
他們找到了她的東西
they found her things.

1082
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,250
在一處海灘上
On a beach.

1083
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,890
還有遺書
With a note.

1084
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,180
她自殺了嗎
She killed herself?

1085
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,230
是這么推測的  沒錯
That's the base theory, yes.

1086
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:32,380
帕克女士  感謝你
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you
