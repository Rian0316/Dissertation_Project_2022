1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,500
你的论点完全缺乏科学价值
Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,030
这很明确
It is well established

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,100
超人通过飞入"黄日"核武器
Superman cleans his uniform

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,830
清理他的衣服
by flying into Earth's yellow sun,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,800
由此能清除所有污染物
which incinerates any contaminate matter

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,900
从而留下安全的氪星布料
and leaves the invulnerable

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,360
既无损坏又完全清洁
Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
要是他弄了点氪星的物质在上面呢
What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,760
例如
Like what?

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,700
我不知道  氪星的芥末
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,330
我觉得我们完全能认为氪星爆炸时
I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
已将所有氪星的调味品都摧毁了
were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,700
又或者它变成了芥末氪星石
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite,

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,030
唯一能摧毁
the only way to destroy

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,130
威胁地球的邪恶氪星热狗
a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
拉杰  拜托
Raj, please,

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,800
严肃点
let's stay serious here.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,660
超人的身体是氪星的
Superman's body is Kryptonian,

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,400
因此他的汗水也是氪星的
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,060
对  要是沾到氪星汗渍呢
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,000
超人在地球不会出汗
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,430
好啊
Okay,

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
他应邀去肯朵的波特城赴晚餐
he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor.

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,960
他把自己变小  进入该城
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city

25
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,500
在那里  他失去了超能力
where he loses his superpowers. Now,

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,830
晚餐前  主人说
before dinner, his host says,

27
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,030
玩一会氪星绳球如何
"Who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?"

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,030
超人说  可以啊  玩得大汗淋漓
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat,

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,660
回到地球  他的衣服已经沾了
comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained

30
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,160
无法去除的氪星汗渍
with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,300
将死你
Boo ya.

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,630
超人能在离开波特前
Superman would have taken his uniform

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,160
把衣服放到肯朵的干洗机清洗
to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,330
肯朵的干洗机  我放弃
"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,700
你们完全没法跟这人理论
You can't have a rational argument with this man.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,460
那不是去年赢得
isn't that the guy who won

37
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,100
麦克亚瑟天才奖的家伙吗
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

38
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,030
不  别一次全部人看
No, not all at once.

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,530
那怎么看
Then how?

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
莱纳德先看
Leonard.

41
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,700
现在轮到拉杰
Now, Raj.

42
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,030
现在轮到谢尔顿
Now, Sheldon.

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,930
我没看清  能再看一遍吗
I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,430
不行
No.

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,460
是戴维・安德希尔  那又怎么样
It's David Underhill. So what?

46
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,600
怎么样
So what?

47
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,800
他对高能正点子的观察报告
His observation of high-energy positrons

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,500
首次确切证明了
has provided the first conclusive evidence

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,530
银河暗物质的存在
for the existence of galactic dark matter.

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,730
我只给你两个词
I have two words for you.

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,130
一个是"太"  一个是"好了"
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,260
确实是很好
It is a big whoop.

53
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,700
这几乎颠覆了
It made almost all the work

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,500
所有你在这里做的工作成果
you've done since you've been here completely useless.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,660
-才怪  -才怪
Did not. Did, too.

56
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,760
才
Did...

57
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,030
好吧  有部分吧  但是
Okay, maybe  <i>some</i> of it, but...

58
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
这小子只是在天时地利的时候
Look, the guy was just in the right place,

59
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,200
利用范式方法重新解释了银河系
at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting

60
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,760
纯粹是狗屎运
reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.

61
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,100
不仅如此
In more ways than one.

62
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,430
他长得很帅呢
He's a very handsome man.

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,900
对我没什么影响  如果换成我
Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way,

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,200
我会更像扎克・埃夫隆那种类型
I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.

65
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,530
对  要是你能有那么一点像他
Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,830
打扰一下
Excuse me...

67

盖博豪斯博士说

72
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,530
如果我要在光电倍增实验室准备试验
to set something up in the photomultiplier lab,

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,360
你能帮我忙
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

74

你要和我一起做实验
You want to work with <i>me?</i> Well,

Wii保龄球游戏里可是投球无回的

我的朋友做运动时总会有重来的

有什么比Wii保龄球之夜
Where were you that's more important

100
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
还重要的
than Wii bowling night?

其实  我
Actually, I was...

102
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,430

It's a rhetorical question.

没什么能比
There <i>is</i> nothing more important

104
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,200
Wii保龄球之夜重要

得了吧  不就是个电子游戏嘛

不仅仅因为他是个天才

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,560
他还绘声绘色的模仿了
He does this hysterical impersonation

121
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,860
史蒂芬・霍金的电话性爱

你穿着什么呢
What are you wearing?

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
还是他演得比较像
That's not... He does it better.

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,230
总之 他说明天他要带我去体育馆
Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow,

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,930
我先回屋练练仰卧起坐的

不 我们不庆祝
No, because we don't celebrate

131
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,230
古老的异教农神节

又到谢尔顿最爱的圣诞特别节目时间了

在基督教出现之前的那些岁月
In the pre-Christian era,

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,460
每当冬至来临大地枯萎
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,

137
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,930
异教徒把常青的枝杈带回家中
pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
用这种形式来表示
as an act of sympathetic magic, intended

139
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,860
保护生命的本质直到春来再次到来
to guard the life essences of the plants until spring.

140
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,600
这种风俗后来
This custom was later appropriated

141
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,600
被北欧人继承  于是演变成了
by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes

142
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
现在的圣诞树
the so-called Christmas tree.

143
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,430
那么查理・布朗  你看到什么叫做无聊了吧

好吧 谢谢
Okay, well, thank you

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,260
买了点蠢蠢的小礼物
a few silly neighbor gifts, so I'll just

147
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,260
我回头搁我的圣诞树底下好了
put them under <i>my</i> tree.

148
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,130
等等!
Wait!

149
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
你给我买了个礼物?
You bought me a present?

150
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,330
你干吗要这么做?
Why would you do such a thing?

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,030
不知道 因为是圣诞节?
I don't know. 'Cause it's Christmas?

152
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,530
哦 佩妮 我知道你认为自己很大方
Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous,

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,430
但送礼是建立在互利互惠的原则上的
but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity.

154
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
你还没给我礼物
You haven't given me a gift.

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,630
就已经塞给我一份责任
You've given me an obligation.

156
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,900
别难过 佩妮 这是新手常犯的错
Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake.

157
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,300
我和谢尔顿过的第一个犹太教光明节
My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,

158
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,060
他对我吼了八个晚上
he yelled at me for eight nights.

159
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,530
没关系 你不用送我什么东西以表回馈
Now, hey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
当然要 这种风俗的精髓就是
Of course I do. The essence of the custom

161
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
现在我不得不出去给你买点东西
is that I now have to go out and purchase for you

162
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,360
价值相当的礼物
a gift of commensurate value

163
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,600
这礼物得体现对我们友谊的相同的感知价值
and representing the same perceived level of friendship

164
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,800
这种感知价值体现于你送我的礼物
as that represented by the gift you've given me.

165
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,100
知道今年自杀率是怎么直线上升的了吧
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,830
好吧  忘了这件事吧
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

167
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
我没有给你准备礼物
I'm not giving you a present.

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,060
太晚了  我都看到了  那个小精灵贴纸
No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker

169
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,230
上面写着  给谢尔顿
says, "To Sheldon."

170
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,060
木已成舟
The die has been cast.

171
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,530
冥冥有手写天书
[欧玛尔・海亚姆波斯诗人  此句曾被马丁・路德・金引用]

172
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
汉尼拔已经翻越了阿尔卑斯山
[迦太基名将汉尼拔曾率领军队及大象翻越积雪的阿尔卑斯山进入意大利]

173
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,300
我知道  有意思
I know. It's funny

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,660
特别是发生在别人身上
when it's not happening to us.

175
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,330
谢尔顿  我非常非常抱歉
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

176
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,030
别  别  我自找的
No. No, I brought this on myself

177
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,560
谁让我不小心成为你生命中美好又重要的一部分呢
by being such an endearing and important part of your life.

178
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,130
谁开车带我去商场
I'm going to need a ride to the mall.

179
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,430
现在发生在咱们头上了
It's happening to us.

180
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
你还好吧
Are you gonna make it?

181
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,960
还好吧
Yeah, I guess.

182
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,160
好的
All right.

183
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,560
谢谢你让我开你的摩托
Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.

184
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,100
不客气
No problem.

185
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,460
我不知道它这么沉
I had no idea it was so heavy.

186
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,260
就这么压到我身上了是吧
The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?

187
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,960
是啊  还没跑起来算你走运
Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

188
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,930
-莱纳德您还好吧  -还好
-Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay? -Oh, yeah.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,430
就是个摩托车小意外
It's just a little motorcycle accident.

190
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,300
我的天  你开得有多快
My God, how fast were you going?

191
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,860
不晓得  就在电光火石之间
I don't know. It's all such a blur.

192
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,430
很幽默  他连发动都发动不起来
Good one. He couldn't even get it started.

193
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,930
嗨  戴维
Hi. Dave. Hi.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,060
佩妮  是你的摩托
Penny. So it's <i>your</i> motorcycle?

195
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,860
没摔坏吧
Is it okay?

196
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,860
没事
It's fine.

197
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,530
算那车走运
Lucky for the bike

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,760
有我的腿垫着
it landed on my leg.

199
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,060
你介意帮我搀这位机车选手一下么
You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?

200

好的好的
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,900
戴维你是怎么认识莱纳德的
So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?

202
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,100
我是个物理学家
I'm a physicist.

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,430
你才不是呢
No, you're not.

204
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,230
有什么奇怪的么
Why is that so surprising?

205
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,760
主要是我所认识的物理学家
Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know

206
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,430
都又白又宅
are indoorsy and pale.

207
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,760
我不是宅男
I'm not indoorsy.

208
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,430
我的防晒霜很好用
I just wear the appropriate sun block

209
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,660
所以黑色素沉淀得很少
because I don't take melanoma lightly.

210
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,900

So, are you

用在一种新的暗物质探测器上面的
for a new dark matter detector.

叫我科学怪人吧  我就是为

这些亚原子痴迷不已

我叫你什么也不会叫你科学怪人的
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.

呵呵  我就是啊
Ha. Well, that's what I am--

224
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,730
怪才天后
queen of the nerds.

225
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760

Well, if you like,

226
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,730
我可以带你参观我们工作的实验室
I could show you the lab we're working in.

227
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
我们有一些很棒的玩意  激光器什么的
We've got some cool toys, you know-- lasers and stuff.

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,500
一直都是呀
Since always.

231
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
莱纳德  你还好么

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,430
-还好吧  -我们现在就去如何
-Yeah. I guess. -How 'bout we go see it now?

233
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,360
之后我们可以到海边兜风
Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast,

234
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,800
再来点吃的东西
We grab a little bite to eat...

235
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500

Um... Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

236
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
我去拿个外套
Let me just get my jacket.

没关系  就是邻居
No, just neighbors.

241
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,530
真的
Really.

242
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
真难想象你就住她隔壁
I don't know how you live next door to that

243
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,700
居然没有什么行动
without doing something about it.

244
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,900
事实上
Actually...

245
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
科学就是我的爱人

246

你没带钥匙么
Did you forget your key?

253
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,130
我看这没有什么女人想要的
I don't see anything in here a woman would want.

254
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,260
开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

255
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,530
这里有身体乳液  沐浴精油  香皂
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

256
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,660
简直是雌激素的帽子戏法[三连发]
that's the estrogen hat trick.

257
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,130
我看是山寨版发音的
What it is is a cacophonous assault

258
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,860
尤加利属植物  月桂树的果实  肉桂和香草
of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

259
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,260
就好像我的头卡到土耳其皇帝的睡衣里面一样
It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.

260
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,360
谢尔顿  如果你不喜欢这些东西
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,

261
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,530
我们去隔壁给她做个填充玩具熊也行
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

262
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,300
告诉过你  我害怕熊
I told you before, bears are terrifying.

263
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
拜托
Come on,

264
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,130
沐浴用品  完美的选择

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,030
这里有香氛蜡烛  洗面扑

266
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,730
薄荷和绿茶味的沐浴精油  放松身心
spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.

267
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,500
前提假设是佩妮身心紧张
That presupposes Penny is tense.

268
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,830
她认识你  能不紧张么
She knows you. She's tense.

269
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,530
我们都紧张  买个礼品篮
We all are. Buy a basket!

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,030
您好  我们选好了
Excuse me, we're ready.

271
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,560
我们还没选好
No, we're not.

272
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,530
假设我同意
Let's say for a moment that I accept

273
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,330
沐浴礼品这个假设
the bath item gift hypothesis,

274
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
现在我要考考你了
I now lay the following conundrum at your feet:

275
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,830
我们该买多大的
Which size?

276
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,760
就这个  我们走
This one. Let's go.

277
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,360
你想都没想过
You put no thought into that.

278
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,800
不好意思  就这个
I'm sorry. Uh... this one.

279
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,700
我们走
Let's go!

280
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,700
我没有足够的数据进行分析
I have insufficient data to proceed.

281
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,100
不好意思小姐
Excuse me, miss?

282
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,330
什么事
Yes?

283
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,100
如果我送给你这个礼物篮
If I were to give you this gift basket,

284
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,630
根据这个行为本身  如果没有其他数据
based on that action alone and no other data,

285
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
请推断并描述我们之间的
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship

286
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,400
假定关系
that exists between us.

287
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,230
不好意思
Excuse me?

288
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,360
这里
Here.

289
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,600
我们是朋友么
Now, are we friends?

290
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,430
同事还是情人
Colleagues? Lovers?

291
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,560
你是我的祖母么
Are you my grandmother?

292
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,260
我不明白你在说什么
I don't understand what you're talking about

293
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,400
不过你让我觉得有点不爽
and you're making me a little uncomfortable.

294
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,200
看到没  就像你和佩妮
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.

295
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,430
我们就要这个了
We'll take it.

296
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,500
莱纳德  过来一块儿坐
Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

297
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,300
哦  嘿  戴维
Oh, hey, Dave.

298
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,560
还有佩妮  你也在这
And Penny, what a surprise.

299
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,930
嘿 莱纳德
Hey, Leonard.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,160
戴维刚刚带我在校园里逛了逛
Dave was just showing me around the university.

301
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,500
你知道么
You know, this place

302
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,660
这个地方真是妙不可言
is unbelievable!

303
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,960
我当然知道
Yeah, I know. I've been offering

304
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,500
这一年半我一直说要带你来看看
to show you around for a year and a half.

305
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,330
你总是说你要去练瑜伽
You always said you had yoga.

306
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,060
从没说过
I never said that.

307
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,000
可能我听错了
Maybe I heard you wrong.

308
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,500
有很多词听起来像瑜伽
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

309
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,830
莱纳德 这真是一个很奇妙的女人
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.

310
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,030
她的思想敏捷而又有求知欲
She has a curious and agile mind,

311
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
更不用提她其他敏捷而奇特的方面了
not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.

312
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,100
别说了
Oh, shut up!

313
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,760
没错 闭嘴吧
Yes, please shut up.

314
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,330
那么  戴维
So, um, Dave,

315
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,700
我们是不是该回实验室干活了?
don't you think you and I should get back to the lab?

316
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,100
你知道 暗物质是不会去自己发现自己的
You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.

317
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,230
我正想下午请个假
Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off

318
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,160
然后和佩妮做个别的"实验"
so I could work on another experiment with Penny.

319
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,000
我们去做实验?
Really? We're going to do an experiment?

320
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,030
我们去试试龙舌兰酒
Uh-huh. We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots

321
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,530
在一个22岁尤物身上会有什么作用
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

322
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,860
那不是实验
It's not an experiment!

323
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,860
再说你昨晚也见到会发生什么了
You saw what happened last night.

324
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,260
走么?  好
You ready to go? Yeah.

325
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,500
噢  我能骑摩托车吗
Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?

326
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
可以啊  有什么不行的
Yeah, why not?

327
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,930
你肯定不会比莱纳德开得还糟的
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
真有趣啊
That's funny.

329
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,260
顺便说一句  我的腿疼死了
By the way, my leg is killing me.

330
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,630
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

331
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,000
大新闻  莱纳德
Mmm, great news, Leonard.

332
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,260
我已经解决了送佩妮礼物的两难困境了
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

333
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,560
我好高兴哦
Yippee.

334
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,630
你想啊  我可能会送得过于好或过于寒碜
You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate,

335
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,630
但我已经想出了一个很简单的点子
but I have devised a foolproof plan.

336
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,560
我会先打开她给我的礼物
See, I will open her gift to me first

337
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,000
接着借故离开
and then excuse myself,

338
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,830
假装消化不良
feigning digestive distress.

339
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,830
然后我会上网查她送的礼物的价格
Then I'll look up the price of her gift online,

340
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,930
从篮子里选一样价格最接近的东西
choose the basket closest to that value,

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,530
送给她
give it to her

342
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,330
最后我把剩下来的以全价退回去
and then I'll return the others for a full refund.

343
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,730
真聪明啊
Brilliant.

344
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,260
的确如此
It is, isn't it?

345
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,900
我可以把这些东西藏在你房间里吗
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

346
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,900
这气味让我想吐
The smell makes me nauseated.

347
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,300
随便你怎么弄啦
Do whatever you want.

348
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,230
谢谢  你真是太高尚了
Thank you, that's very gracious.

349
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,030
先生们
Gentlemen.

350
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,530
你为什么不做莱纳德才做的事情
Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did

351
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,530
给佩妮介绍个男朋友
and get Penny a new boyfriend?

352
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,260
我的腿疼死了
My leg is killing me.

353
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,630
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

354
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,500
我只有一个问题想问你
Okay, I have just one question for you.

355
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,300
当我很开心的和你在一起的时候
While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us,

356
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,700
你说你不想和我约会
you said that you didn't want

357
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
只是因为我对你来说太聪明了
to go out with me because I was too smart for you!

358
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,060
那好吧  新闻来了  女士
Well, news flash, lady

359
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,530
戴维・安德希尔比我聪明十倍
David Underhill is ten times smarter than me!

360
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,830
对我来说  你得把一个道钉钉进
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain

361
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,160
他脑子里  我才能在国际跳棋中打败他
for me to beat him at checkers!

362
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,430
和他相比
Next to him,

363
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,560
我比较像那些打手语的大猩猩之一
I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas

364
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,830
只知道怎么要葡萄
who knows how to ask for grapes!

365
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,860
所以  我的问题是...
So, my question is...

366
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,900
我聪明又怎么了啊
What's up with that?!

367
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,330
你干嘛对我大吼大叫啊
Why are you yelling at me?

368
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,430
对不起  对不起  对不起
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

369
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,060
别介意  我们没事了
Never mind, we're cool.

370
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,530
戴维并没有你聪明
Dave is not smarter than you.

371
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,830
他是个白痴
He's an idiot.

372
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,160
真的吗  你为什么这么说啊
Really? Why would you say that?

373
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,630
因为聪明的人会把他老婆的裸照从手机里删了
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife

374
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,060
在他打算把他女朋友的裸照
off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos

375
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,900
存进手机之前
of his girlfriend.

376
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,460
他打算给你拍裸照吗
He tried to take nude photos of you?

377
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,400
你就听到了这个
That's what you took from that?!

378
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,360
这家伙已经结婚了
The guy is married!

379
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,760
噢  是的
Oh, yeah.

380
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,460
对不起  那真是太糟糕了
I'm so-- Oh, that's terrible.

381
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,160
而你  如果你和我约会的时候
And you, if you are so okay

382
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,330
是很开心的
with the way things are between us,

383
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,700
你干嘛这么嫉妒啊
why are you so jealous?

384
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,030
恩...
Well, uh...

385
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,360
重要的是他已经结婚了  而且这太糟糕了
The important thing is he's married and that's terrible!

386
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,930
球救得好啊  天才啊
Nice save, genius.

387
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,400
蛋酒要吗
Eggnog?

388
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,730
我不能吃乳糖
Lactose.

389
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,760
里面只有朗姆酒
It's just rum.

390
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,200
在半小时前里面就已经不是蛋酒了
It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.

391
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,900
很好喝啊
Smooth.

392
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,300
比你更味美啊
Smoother than you.

393
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,960
拜托  现在是圣诞节  就这么对我啊
Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.

394
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,860
好吧  圣诞快乐
Okay, Merry Christmas.

395
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
顺便提一句  我的腿疼死了
By the way, my leg is killing me.

396
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,200
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

397
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,800
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

398
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,900
你的腿怎么样了
How's your leg?

399
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,230
很好  谢谢关心  进来吧
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.

400
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,200
哦  真棒  佩妮  你来和我交换礼物了
Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts.

401
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,760
当你知道无论你送什么
You'll be pleased to know

402
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,130
我都有相应的准备着  你会很高兴的
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

403
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,730
好的  给你
Okay, here.

404
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,130
我要声明一下  我现在有些消化不良
I should note I'm having some digestive distress,

405
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,730
所以  如果我突然离开一下  不要惊异哦
so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed.

406
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,200
噢  一条餐巾
Oh, a napkin.

407
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,130
把它翻过来
Turn it over.

408
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,160
送给谢尔顿
"To Sheldon,

409
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,600
多福多寿
"live long and prosper.

410
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,900
莱纳德・尼莫哀致[《星际迷航》中演员]
Leonard Nimoy."

411
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,860
是的  他来饭馆
Yeah, he came into the restaurant.

412
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,000
很抱歉餐巾脏了  他用它擦过嘴了
Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

413
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
我有莱纳德・尼莫哀的DNA了
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

414
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,100
对啊...
Well...

415
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,760
是  是的  我想是这样的
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

416
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,730
但是  看哪  他还在上面签名了
But look, he signed it.

417
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,660
你难道没有意识到这意味着什么吗
Do you realize what this means?!

418
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
我只需要一颗健康的卵子
All I need is a healthy ovum

419
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,830
我就可以培育出我的莱纳德・尼莫哀了
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

420
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,030
好吧  我给你的只是餐巾而已  谢尔顿
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.

421
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,200
我马上回来
Be right back.

422
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560

噢  一份摩托车课程的及格证书

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,930
真会体贴人啊
Very thoughtful.

425
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,960
是啊  而且我查过了
Yeah, and I checked.

426
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,400
第一课就是不会让你再从车上摔下来
Not letting the bike fall on you

427
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,430
而且是车还在原地没动的时候
while standing still is lesson one.

428
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,900
噢  那么  我想你看到我送你的东西  你会很感动的
Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.

429
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
好的
Okay.

430
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,500
献给孩子们的最酷的101个科学实验

431
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,260
你知道吗  因为你如此迷恋科学
You know, 'cause you're so into science.

432
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,400
谢尔顿  你干了什么啊
Sheldon! What did you do?!

433
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,560
我知道
I know!

434
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,430
这些还不够  对吗
It's not enough, is it?

435
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,600
还有这个
Here.

436
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,160
莱纳德  看哪  谢尔顿在抱我呢
Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me.

437
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,630
这是农神节的奇迹啊
It's a Saturnalia miracle.
