1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,100
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,800
Someone sent that note to my wife,
and I need to know who.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,700
Some secrets were discovered...

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,800
After my mom died, I started
remembering what happened to Dana.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,700
Who's Dana?

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,500
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,600
Some secrets were uncovered...

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,400
It could be any one of these guys
she's having an affair with.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Don't worry about it.
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
And some secrets...

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Jordana Geist manages to get her work done.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,603
How do you cram it all in?

13
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:25,300
Were shared.

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,400
That's A.D.D. medication.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,100
Competition --

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,700
it means different things to different people.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,800
In suburbia, it means keeping up with the Joneses.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
On Wisteria Lane,

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,000
that means keeping up with Bree Van De Kamp.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,200
Everyone knew Bree had the nicest
lawn in the neighborhood,

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
and no one be grudged her this.

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
No one, that is,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,100
except Martha Huber,

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,100
whose own lawn paled in comparison.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
No matter how carefully she trimmed...

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,900
or how lovingly she watered...

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,900
or how generously she fertilized...

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,900
the grass was always greener
on the other side of the fence.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,300
Hello, Victor.
How are you today?

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,400
Out jogging again?

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
I can't catch my breath.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Would you like a slurp from my hose?

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,800
Victor?

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,900
Victor?

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,500
Don't worry.

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,700
I'm going to get an ambulance.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Then one day Mrs. Huber finally got the
chance to mow down the competition.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Help!

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Somebody help!

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
What happened?

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,500
He collapsed on your hydrangeas.

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,100
Call 911!

43
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, Mrs. Huber understood
the first rule of competition --

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,300
in order to win, you have to want it more.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,500
Episode 7 : Anything You Can Do

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When I was alive,

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,900
my friends and I came together once a month
for a meeting of the Wisteria Lane book club.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,200
We found the problems of literary
characters so absorbing --

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the way they dealt with adversity,

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
conducted illicit affairs,

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
endured domestic dramas,

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
and planned romantic conquests.

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,400
But since my death, my friends had
lost their interest in fiction.

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,700
So... what did everybody think?

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Their own problems had become absorbing enough.

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,300
I thought the character of Madame
Bovary was very inspirational.

57
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
Inspirational?

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,500
She poisons herself with arsenic.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,400
Really?

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,500
You didn't read until the end?

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,800
I stopped after page 50.

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,900
Am I the only one who read the book?

63
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,700
I saw the movie.
It was really good.

64
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Ladies, I'm sorry, but

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,600
what is the point of having a book club
if we don't read the book?

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,300
More wine?

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
So, uh, Reba, Emma, and Laurie,

68
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,600
would you girls come to the kitchen
and help me with the snacks?

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,100
Sure.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
I will be right in.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
God, I couldn't wait to get rid of them.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,700
Okay,

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,900
so Lynette said that you found Zach.

74
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,700
He's at a rehabilitation center,

75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,300
and Julie snuck in and actually talked to him.

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Did he say anything about his mother's suicide?

77
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,400
There wasn't enough time, but he did say
one thing that was kind of mysterious.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
He said something happened to someone named Dana,

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,300
and that he could never, ever talk about it.

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Who the hell's Dana?

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
That's the mystery part.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I figure Dana has something to do with
what Mary Alice was trying to hide.

83
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,200
So somebody found out Mary Alice's secret...

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
and sent the note.

85
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
So who the hell is that?

86
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,200
The stationery is parchment
number 17, 100% cotton.

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,300
It's made by Cypress Office Products.

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,100
They have stores in 12 cities, including yours.

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Now, I traced that postmark
back to your local post office.

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,900
Meaning?

91
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Meaning that the blackmailer is
probably someone you know --

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,000
a neighbor, milkman...

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
pool boy, soccer mom.

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,200
Soccer mom?

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Mr. Young, sometimes evil drives a minivan.

96
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,300
I had this gig once

97
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,900
tracking down this PTA mom who was hell-bent on landing her daughter

98
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,600
a spot on the parade float.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Fed antifreeze to half the homecoming committee.

100
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
Did you catch her?

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,200
Mr. Young...

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
the people who hired me didn't
hire me to catch her.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
Wow, honey, --

104
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,200
this place looks spotless.

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,500
Thanks.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
Hey, so, listen,

107
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:36,200
I have come up with this killer idea
for the Spotless Scrub campaign.

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
Great. You want to run it by me?

109
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,400
No, I'm good.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
But thanks.

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,100
Okay.

112
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,600
Well, that's the thing. You know how whenever
I pitch in the boardroom at work,

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,500
and Hennessy always tears my ideas down
in front of the partners?

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Yeah.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,500
I invited the partners and their wives
over so I could pitchto them here,

116
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,100
and I thought maybe we could make a formal
dinner for six, we could sit, we could --

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,900
and when exactly would this
formal dinner take place?

118
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
Uh, day after tomorrow.

119
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,900
- Tom.
- Yeah, I know, I know,

120
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,500
I know it's short notice. I just --

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,900
You think? How am I supposed to pull off
a formal dinner with no warning?

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,200
I don't know. Bree Van De Kamp does
this kind of thing all the time.

123
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,300
What did you say?

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Wow, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

125
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,700
That's -- you know what? Forget it.
I'll call, and I'll cancel.

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,600
Just don't worry about it.

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,200
No, no, let's --let's do it.

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Really?

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
Yeah. It's good for your career.
I'll pull it off.

130
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,600
Yes. Honey, thank you so much.

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
You know what? I promise, I land this account,

132
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,500
and I'm going to buy you something awful pretty.

133
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Luckily for Tom,
Lynette had a recipe for success.

134
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Unfortunately for her,

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
she was missing the secret ingredient.

136
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
- Yeah.
- It's me.

137
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,300
Don't turn around. My mother-in-law can see you.

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
I hate that she's always watching us.

139
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,700
So meet me at the motel in an hour?

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
John?

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,300
Uh, I've got plans.

142
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,900
So cancel.

143
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,700
They're with Danielle.
We're going to the movies.

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
That sounds like a date.

145
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,603
Yeah.

146
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,100
Well, I have a problem with you seeing other girls.

147
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
Well, I have a problem with you having a husband.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,700
I guess we'll both have to learn to deal.

149
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Don't even try to make it up to me by talking dirty.

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
& nbsp;

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Hello?

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Mr. and Mrs. Van De Kamp.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
So your son decided to entertain
some of his friends yesterday

154
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
by shoving a freshman's head into a locker.

155
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
This was the Johnson boy?

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,300
Yes. He broke the boy's nose.

157
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,400
Because of our no-tolerance policy,
your son may face expulsion.

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,900
You're going to ruin his whole future
over a little rough housing?

159
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,600
Rex, this was practially assault.

160
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Mrs. Stark, what Andrew did was clearly wrong,

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,400
but in his defense, his mother and I are
going through severe marital problems.

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
How is that relevant?

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Our marriage is disintegrating.

164
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,800
Of course Andrew is acting out.
He has every right to be angry.

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
If Andrew's angry about you
moving out of the house,

166
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
then perhaps he should shove
your head into a locker.

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,100
All I'm saying is that we need to take
some of the responsibility here.

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,900
So does Andrew.

169
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,600
Blaming his actions on our problems --

170
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
which are not so serious --

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,400
does not help him.

172
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Our problems are serious.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Mrs. Stark, you handle this however you see fit.

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Bree, I've gone to an attorney.

175
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,000
You're going to be served with
divorce papers later today.

176
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,500
You went to an attorney?

177
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Yeah.

178
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,500
And a good one, too.

179
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, he better be good,

180
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,900
because when I'm finished with you,

181
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,400
you won't have a cent to your name.

182
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
Bring it on.

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,200
Perhaps detention is the way to go.

184
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,400
Mom, you're getting too dressed up.

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
I know, but I want to look really sexy.

186
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,500
I told Mike I expect him to have you home by 11:00.

187
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,600
Hmm. How about midnight?

188
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,500
All right, but no later.
You know how I worry.

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,800
So, you, uh, got protection?

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,500
Oh, my god.

191
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
We are so not having this conversation.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,500
We are, because I enjoy being an only child.

193
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,700
Are you finished?

194
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,100
Almost.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
You know, I always assumed I'd have sex
for the first time before you had it again.

196
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Okay, you can leave now, mm-hmm.

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,300
Y eah.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,300
What do you think? Trying too hard?

199
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
Yeah, well, what do you know?

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
It's 80 degrees outside, and you're wearing fur.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,300
Hey, Mike.

202
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Hey, Edie.

203
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,700
Wow. Get a load of you.

204
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
Ooh, you look so pretty.

205
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,100
I hardly recognize you.

206
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,800
Oh, this?

207
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, I have a date right now with Mike.

208
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
We kissed.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
FYI.

210
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
Ooh, love that jacket. Good choice.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,700
Um, look, Susan, I'm really sorry,
but I've got to cancel.

212
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,400
I have an...

213
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,200
unexpected houseguest.

214
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Coming through.

215
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Kendra.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,300
Susan.

217
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm going to run to the car and get my stuff.

218
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,200
I know how this looks,
but there's nothing between us.

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,900
Kendra's just an old friend.

220
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Old friend.

221
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeah, you know --

222
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
No, actually, no, I don't know.

224
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,100
So by "old friend," you mean college pal,
bowling buddy, saved you from drowning?

225
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,700
It's hard to explain.

226
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Could you give it a shot?

227
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,400
Mike, I'm going to go upstairs and take a shower.

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,900
Look, I promise I'll make this up to you.

229
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,700
And...

230
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
you look amazing.

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,900
Mike, where are the towels?

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Thanks.

233
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey!

234
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,300
How was your big date?

235
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
& nbsp;

236
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
Mike had to reschedule.

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Oh, because of the hot girl with
the suitcase over there?

238
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,900
Gosh, how devastating for you.

239
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,200
FYI.

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,700
Look, I just want to move this place fast.
I'll do whatever we have to do.

241
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Well, that's good to know.

242
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,300
You do realize that you're going to have to disclose the fact
that your wife killed herself in the house.

243
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,400
I am?

244
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
Oh, yeah.

245
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,300
Legal crap.

246
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,600
You know, people get really freaked out by suicides.

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,700
I can't blame them. Hell.

248
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,400
I get the willies just standing here.

249
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,700
Is there any way to get around it?

250
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Off the record?

251
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,300
Yeah.

252
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,800
You could say that she shot herself in the living room

253
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
and then crawled out back to die.

254
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Well, I'm just saying.

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, I got to go. I'll call you tomorrow.

256
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,300
Edie, wait.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Paul had always known Edie Britt was capable
of doing anything to close a deal.

258
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,700
But now he realized she was capable of so much more.

259
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,800
Hey, Danielle.

260
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,500
Hey, Mrs. Solis.

261
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,900
Oh, Danielle...

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,900
remember when you said you wanted to be a model?

263
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,300
You remember that? That was, like, last summer.

264
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,500
Well, as it turns out, Percik Modeling Academy
has an opening for their summer program.

265
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Would you like me to sponsor you?

266
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,500
Would I? Oh, my god. That's, like,
one of the best schools in the country.

267
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,600
You would do that for me?

268
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
I sure would.

269
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,500
I would so love to go to New York.

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,300
Oh, and I would so love to help you get there.

271
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,600
Hey, Jordana.

272
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
Hey, Lynette. How are you?

273
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
You look a little tired. Is everything okay?

274
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,000
Actually, I'm getting ready for a dinner
party tomorrow night -- six people.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,900
Sounds fun.

276
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,200
Big fun.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Say, you wouldn't have any of your kids' A.D.D. medication
that you could spare just to get me over the hump --

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,100
Tina!

279
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,700
Don't push your sister.

280
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,200
Gosh, Lynette,

281
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm really running low.

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
I need all my energy I can get.

283
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,100
My sister Elaine and her kids
are flying in town for a week.

284
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, that's exciting.
I wish my sister would visit more often.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, sisters are great.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,100
Yeah.

287
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,600
Just three or four pills.
I'm really hitting a wall here.

288
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Yeah, the come-down can be a real bitch.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,100
I wish I could help.

290
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm not going to forget about this, Jordana.

291
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
It means come girl scout cookie time,

293
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,500
don't bother bringing around little Tina,
because we won't be home.

294
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,200
What's all this about?

295
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,100
You both know that your mother and
I have been unhappy for quite a while.

296
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,500
After a lot of soul-searching, we've decided
that it would be better if we got divorced.

297
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,900
But whatever problems your father and I may have,

298
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,100
it doesn't change the fact that
we love you very, very much.

299
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
I've got a question.

300
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,700
Go ahead, sweet heart. Ask whatever you want.

301
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,600
Can I live with dad?

302
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,200
I mean, come on, mom, let's face it --
we drive each other crazy.

303
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Is -- is that what you would prefer, Danielle --
to live with your father?

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,700
I don't really care as long as I have my own bathroom.

305
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
Um... all this, um,

306
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,400
wine is, uh, giving me a headache.

307
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,300
Six weeks in the suburban jungle and this is all you got?

308
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,600
There are over 300 families in this subdivision.

309
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,100
It'll take time to check them all out.

310
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,700
Dad said last time he saw you, you were ready to quit.

311
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

312
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,700
This is a gigantic waste of your time,
and my father's money.

313
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,500
What, are you afraid of the old man
burning through your inheritance?

314
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,200
That's not funny.

315
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,800
Mike, here's the thing.

316
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
What?

317
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,000
Dad can't chase ghosts alone.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,700
If you stop, he'll have to accept it's over.

319
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,500
Let me have my father back.

320
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,300
If I quit, he'll just hire somebody else.

321
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,600
Not if you tell him there's nothing here to find.

322
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Well, I can't do that.

323
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,700
What happens when your girlfriend finds out
you're not just this sweet, neighborly plumber?

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
You're lying to her, Mike.

325
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Oh, here it is.

326
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Great.

327
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,000
This will keep the crab dip warm.

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
It took forever to shell the little
buggers, but it'll be worth it.

329
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
You shelled your own crabs?

330
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay, I don't want to butt in,
but are you doing too much?

331
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,500
'Cause you look exhausted.

332
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,100
Oh, I'm fine. I just need some coffee.

333
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,400
Thank you.

334
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,600
Oh, my god.
Look at this embroidery.

335
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,100
"Dana."

336
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,200
Where did this come from?

337
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,400
Paul Young's garage sale.

338
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
Dana.

339
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,100
Wow.

340
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,600
Dana was a baby.

341
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Surprise.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,900
No way.

343
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,600
Yep.

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,300
No way.

345
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,200
Nah, it's all yours. Here are the keys.

346
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Rex, what's this about?

347
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,500
I went and splurged a little.

348
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, Danielle, here's your present.

349
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,800
Luggage?

350
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,900
Yeah. It's to take with you to the Percik Mmodeling Aacademy.

351
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,400
I'm footing the entire bill.

352
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
You mean it? I can really go to new york?

353
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,500
Wait. Wait a minute.
What's all this about a modeling academy?

354
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
It's my new career. Mrs. Solis is sponsoring me.

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, is she now? And when were you planning on telling me?

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
She told me, and I think it's a great idea.

357
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't you two see what he's doing?

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
He's trying to get you on his side.
He's trying to buy your love.

359
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,500
Oh, for god's sake, don't be paranoid.

360
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,000
A car? A modeling academy?

361
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
You should have discussed these gifts with me first.

362
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,900
I'm sorry, kids, but we cannot accept them.

363
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Dad, you can't let her do this.

364
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,800
Bree, we just told the kids we're getting divorced.
Isn't it time to spoil them a little?

365
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,500
I said no.

366
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,800
You know what?

367
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,800
They're my kids, too,
and I can give the many thing I want.

368
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,400
There you go.

369
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,100
- Thank you, daddy.
- Yes!

370
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,500
Did you offer to help Danielle get into modeling school?

371
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,800
What?

372
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Uh, yes.

373
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
No. Um...

374
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,100
is that how she heard it?

375
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes. Gabrielle, did you or did you not offer to sponsor her?

376
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,500
I just wanted to help out.

377
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,100
It's in New York, for god's sakes.
Why on earth would you suggest that?

378
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
It's her dream, and don't you want her to be happy?

379
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
No.

380
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,500
And in the future, I would appreciate you
keeping your ridiculous ideas to yourself.

381
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,100
Bree.

382
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,900
John.

383
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,400
John!

384
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,700
You're so jealous of Danielle,
you try to ship her off to New York?

385
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm not jealous. I just don't like to share.

386
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,900
Well, you know what?
I quit. The yard, us, everything.

387
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh, don't be that way.

388
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Well, what's the point if we can never be together?

389
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
You know, an hour here, an hour there.

390
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,700
I don't want us to end on a bad note.

391
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,800
Carlos has this black-tie thing tonight.

392
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,600
- I could slip out --
- Mrs. Solis --

393
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
John, please.

394
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,200
What we had was so special.

395
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
I think it deserves a proper goodbye.

396
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,700
We'd, um...

397
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
we'd still be over, though.

398
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Of course.

399
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
I knew this play date was a good idea.

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, thank you for suggesting it.

401
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,300
Your boys are the only ones
I know who could tire out Timmy.

402
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,500
Yep, he's a feisty one.

403
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Hey, word on the street is, um,
you've been medicating Timmy?

404
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, yeah, for his A.D.D.

405
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,700
The pills have been a god send.

406
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,000
I bet.

407
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,500
Can I use your bathroom?

408
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,600
As Lynette swallowed the stolen
medication of an 8-year-old child,

409
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,300
she vowed she'd never again sink to such depths...

410
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
anytime soon.

411
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,100
Well, it looks like you've got your black mailer.

412
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,200
Is it time to bring in the police?

413
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
That's not really an option for me.

414
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
Mm.

415
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,361
Before my wife shot herself,

416
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,800
we lived a life that I was proud of.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,900
We loved each other,

418
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,400
we had values, we went to church,

419
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,100
we gave to charity.

420
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,800
We were good people, Mr. Shaw.

421
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Oh, I believe you.

422
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,000
That's why it's so incomprehensible to me
that Edie Britt would try to destroy us.

423
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Well, you've suffered a great loss.

424
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
For your pain to heal, that's going to take some time.

425
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
I can't wait.

426
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,400
I need help now.

427
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,700
For 5 grand, she's hurt.

428
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,600
10 grand, she's gone.

429
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Mom, what's going on?

430
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
Oh, I'm throwing you out.

431
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
I've separated all your things into two sides.

432
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,200
This side is yours, Danielle,
and the other one is Andrew's.

433
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,800
Okay, you-- you've lost it.

434
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,100
Where are we supposed to live?

435
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,500
Darned if I know.

436
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,400
Uh, Danielle, everything in the north quadrant
of your side is clothes and books and such,

437
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
and the south side are miscellaneous items.

438
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,900
Mom, this isn't going to work, okay?
I'm not giving up my car.

439
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,900
That's a smart idea, because you're probably
going to have to sleep in it for a while.

440
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
Mom, you can't stop us from going back inside the house.

441
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,300
Oh, no? That's Mr. Conlan, the locksmith.
He's been very helpful today.

442
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,500
Of course, I could give you the new keys,

443
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,400
which would mean you'd have to adhere to my rules,

444
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,500
which include giving back your father's gifts.

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay, fine, you win. I won't go to New York.

446
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,600
I'm outta here.

447
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Oh, hello.

448
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,400
- Welcome. I'm Edie.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

449
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
An open house in the suburbs?

450
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,300
This is beyond kitsch.

451
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,200
Just be have yourself.

452
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
This is one of the houses on the street
I've had a hard time getting into.

453
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,100
God, I wish you would let this go.

454
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm taking you out for drinks tonight.

455
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,900
There's this cowboy bar called the
Saddle Ranch you need to see.

456
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,200
Why?

457
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
It's the last place anybody ever saw your sister.

458
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Susan.

459
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,200
What brings you here?

460
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,400
I just wanted to say goodbye to Mary Alice's house

461
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
before somebody else moved in.

462
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,800
Aw.

463
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
That sounds almost plausible.

464
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
I beg your pardon?

465
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh, come on.

466
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,700
We both know why you're here,

467
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,000
and the answer is yes, they are having sex.

468
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
No question.

469
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
You don't know what you're talking about.
They're just friends.

470
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,000
Hmm. Think so?

471
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,100
I overheard them say that they're
going to the Saddle Ranch tonight

472
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,500
for drinks and dancing.

473
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
So? Friends can do that.

474
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,500
Oh, my god.
I just want to slap and shake you.

475
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
Where did you say they were going tonight?

476
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
I don't know why I let you talk me into coming here.

477
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,000
There is obviously nothing going on between them.

478
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,900
Where are you going?

479
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,300
I'm going to the bathroom, and then I'm going home.

480
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
I don't want Mike to catch me here.

481
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,200
It's only been 10 minutes.

482
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
She could be waiting to make her move.

483
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,700
Oh, come on. You're not going to beat
a girl like that by knocking off early.

484
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
It's not a competition.

485
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,900
The hell it isn't.

486
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
Good night, Edie.

487
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,200
Suit yourself.

488
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
But for the record...

489
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,300
I was rooting for you to land him.

490
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,400
And why would you root for me?

491
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,100
Well, I figured it'd be easier for me
to steal Mike from you than her.

492
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,500
She seems like fun.

493
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,600
Just take some ant acid.

494
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
It's not those kind of cramps.

495
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,300
This is a business dinner.

496
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
It's important.

497
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,300
Mm.

498
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
Relax.

499
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,700
You and I can go alone.

500
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,300
Gabrielle can stay here and get better.

501
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,200
Fine.

502
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,900
See you in a couple of hours.

503
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay.

504
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,300
Take good care of Carlos.

505
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,600
Oh, I always do.

506
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
Go, Edie!

507
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,200
Oh, god.

508
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,600
Mike.

509
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,300
What a small, small world.

510
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,700
Yeah, it sure is.

511
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,400
I caught Edie hiding in the back.

512
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
No kidding. Is she here?

513
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah.

514
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Yeah, she said, um, "the jig is up,"
and then she went to ride the bull.

515
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,500
Oh, and she said you two came together.

516
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh, well, yeah. W-we did.

517
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,300
Uh, I just thought she left.

518
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,600
Are you following me?

519
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,100
What?

520
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,700
No.

521
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,700
No, I just came here, you know, with Edie.

522
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,000
We just love to ride that bull.

523
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,600
You ride the bull?

524
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,900
Yeah. Yeah, it's a real rush.

525
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,400
Come on, Susan. Give me a break.

526
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,700
No, you know, you give me a break.

527
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,500
I did not follow you here,
and even if I had followed you here,

528
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,400
it's just because you've been so secretive about Kendra.

529
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200
Kendra and I are friends.

530
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,800
And I came here to ride the bull.

531
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
Whoo!

532
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,900
We got another one to ride the bull!

533
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,700
Okay, little doggie,

534
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,000
you're up.

535
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh, fun.

536
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I'm a doggie.

537
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,200
Oh. Whoo.

538
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Oh, yeah. I'm here to ride the bull.

539
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,300
Check it out. Whoo!

540
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah! Whoo!

541
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,700
Baby!

542
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,100
Whoo!

543
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,300
Aah! Ooh.

544
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,500
Andrew, you promised you'd stay with your mother.

545
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,300
That's why I gave you the car.

546
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,700
Dad, she wants me out.
She put all my stuff on the front lawn.

547
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,800
This is ridiculous.

548
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm going to call her, and I'm going to smooth all this out.

549
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,200
You're going home.

550
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
No, dad, why?

551
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,900
Now I can live with you without feeling guilty.

552
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,100
It'll be perfect. It'll be like
our own little bachelor pad.

553
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,700
What?

554
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Son, that's not going to happen.

555
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
Why not?

556
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,500
Andrew...

557
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,100
you know, these --these last few months
have been incredibly difficult for me.

558
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,600
There are a lot of things that I've got to work out for myself,

559
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
and I can't do it if you're living with me.

560
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,900
I don't care, all right?

562
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm not going back there.

563
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,600
I don't think you have a choice.

564
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
But, dad --

565
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,800
unh-unh.

566
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,100
Oh.

567
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,600
Come on now. Don't --

568
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
Heath?

569
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,900
Yeah, it's me.

570
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Do you still have your fake I.D.?

571
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Yeah, I've got to go home and kiss my mother's
ass, and I am not going to do it sober.

572
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,500
"That was more than I needed to know."

573
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,000
He was in shock. He was totally shocked.

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,100
He says, "Congressman, this was a campaign.

575
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,200
This was not the vote. You voted already."

576
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
That's what it was.

577
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,800
I love that one.

578
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, the desserts look wonderful.

579
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,500
Lynette, do you need any help?

580
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,100
I got it covered. No problem.

581
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,900
Okay, Scavo, you're up.

582
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,300
Let's hear this genius idea of yours.

583
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
Okay.

584
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
Uh...

585
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,000
okay.

586
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,000
The single greatest obstacle facing
Spotless Scrub is a lack of visibility.

587
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,800
We need to concentrate ad spending in places
where women spend the majority of their time.

588
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,300
For example, large chain grocery stores.

589
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,100
Picture Spotless Scrub ads on the
side of every mother's shopping cart.

590
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,500
Interesting.

591
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh, you know what'd be even better?

592
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Dry cleaning bags.

593
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
What?

594
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,000
No, really, hear me out.

595
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,500
Put a big Spotless Scrub ad between
a woman and her cashmere sweater,

596
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,700
I guarantee you'll get her attention.

597
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,500
Honey, honey, that's great.

598
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm in the middle of a thing here.

599
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,600
Oh.

600
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,600
Look -- she's got a point.

601
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,500
I would notice that.

602
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,000
And those dry cleaning bags hang in our closets forever,

603
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,500
and so it is like constant advertising.

604
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,200
Exactly.

605
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,700
You know, maybe there's a way that
we can work that in, but back to me.

606
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,800
You know, Lynette, this is kind of a fantastic idea.

607
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,300
Can we go nation wide with this?

608
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
Why not? Start by targeting the top chain.

609
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,900
Then branch out from there.

610
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,500
Boom, boom, boom -- mass saturation.

611
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Oh, you know what else would be a great idea?

612
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,600
Here's the thing...

613
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,800
While Lynette was commanding everyone's attention,

614
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,000
Susan was trying to remain inconspicuous.

615
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Everybody's looking at me, aren't they?

616
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,300
Just the slapstick fans.

617
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Oh, god, why couldn't I have just
been knocked unconscious?

618
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,400
Beer?

619
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
Absolutely.

620
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,600
Oh.

621
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Ow.

622
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Ow, ow.

623
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Susan, this is Kendra.

624
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,200
We've been introduced.

625
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,000
No, this is Kendra. We've been friends for years.

626
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,200
She's here on a visit. She's leaving tomorrow.

627
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
That's it.

628
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,700
It's true.

629
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,100
I have no designs on this man whatsoever.

630
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,600
I'll be right back.

631
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

632
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Me too.

633
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,000
So how long have you two been seeing each other?

634
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,100
Well, you sort of interrupted our first date,

635
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,300
but up until then, smoking hot tension.

636
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Sounds pathetic, I know.

637
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,400
No, I think it's good to take it slow.

638
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,600
You'd be smart to be careful.

639
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,900
Any particular reason?

640
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,600
Look, Mike's a wonderful guy, really,

641
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,400
but you should ask him why he moved to Wisteria Lane.

642
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,500
It's one hell of a story.

643
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
Here, I got some ice.

644
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,800
Here you go.

645
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Thanks.

646
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,800
Well, it's been fun. Thanks, guys.

647
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,700
See you later.

648
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,300
Whoo-wee.

649
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Good evening.

650
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,300
Well, good evening.

651
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,000
Have a seat.

652
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,000
I could get used to this whole closure thing.

653
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,200
I love long goodbyes.

654
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,500
Wait around the corner. I'll be right back.

655
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,500
Smile, Gabrielle.

656
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,700
Well, that's it, then.

657
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
What are you doing?

658
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,500
She had a camera. We've got to catch her.

659
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,700
Mrs. Solis, your husband's going to kill us.

660
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,300
Come on!

661
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Leave me alone!

662
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,600
Give me that camera right now!

663
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,100
Shut up.

664
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm not kidding, old woman!

665
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Stay away from me! Don't touch me!

666
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,100
No.

667
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,100
No, you go home.

668
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,100
I'll take care of this.

669
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,700
And you were never here.

670
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,900
Go.

671
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,100
Go.

672
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Did you see that?

673
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,500
That guy came barreling around the corner and just hit her.

674
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Do you have a cell phone?

675
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah.

676
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,500
Call 911.

677
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,700
As Juanita teetered dangerously close to the white light,

678
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,000
Lynette and Tom were headed into a black hole.

679
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,200
I was just participating.

680
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,100
Well -- no, your participation was supposed
to be limited to making dinner,

681
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,600
not making my ideas look bad.

682
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,100
Yeah, well, maybe you need better ideas.

683
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

684
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,400
No. No, no, no, no.

685
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,000
We both know that your career was going
so much better than mine before we had kids.

686
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,600
You never let me forget that.

687
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,200
That is not fair.

688
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,100
You're always competing with me,

689
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,200
and judging by tonight, you know what? You still are.

690
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,700
Tom, I am sorry about tonight, truly,

691
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,500
but these days, if I'm competing with anyone,
it's the Bree Van De Kamps of the world,

692
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,100
with their spotless kitchens and their perfect kids
who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong.

693
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,400
I try so hard to keep up, but I can't.

694
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,300
Lynette, that's not my expecta--

695
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,900
and when you work on a pitch or you bring the partners over,

696
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,300
I am reminded of a world I left behind where I was the winner

697
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,700
and people tried to keep up with me.

698
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
I can't go back. I can't win where I am.

699
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,400
I am stuck in the middle, and it is
really starting to get to me.

700
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
For your information,

701
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,700
I thought you threw an amazing dinner party tonight.

702
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,100
I was thrilled.

703
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,600
I don't know how you pulled it all together.

704
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,400
Yeah, well...

705
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,500
and whether you believe it or not,

706
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,900
everyone who knows you thinks
that you are a great wife and mother.

707
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,800
No, they don't.

708
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Yes, they do.

709
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,000
Especially me.

710
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Thanks.

711
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

712
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,800
Nothing. I'm tired.

713
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,900
Turn around. Wait a minute. I want to look at you. What --

714
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm fine, really.

715
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,800
Wow, what's going on outside?

716
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, my...

717
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,300
oh, my god. Thank god you're here.

718
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,700
Will you go take care of Gabrielle?
I have to go home for a minute.

719
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,300
All right.

720
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,400
Oh, Andrew, thank god you're back.

721
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
I need your help, honey.

722
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
There's been an accident.

723
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,600
Andrew?

724
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,500
Mama?

725
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,500
Andrew.

726
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,300
Rex, you need to come home.

727
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,700
Something's happened, and we need you.

728
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
Competition.

729
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,300
It means different things to different people,

730
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,300
but whether it's a friendly rivalry

731
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,800
or a fight to the death...

732
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
Cheers.

733
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,000
The end result is the same.

734
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,800
There will be winners...

735
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,900
and there will be losers.

736
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,100
Of course, the trick is

737
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,900
to know which battles to fight.

738
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,800
You see...

739
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,300
no victory comes without a price.
