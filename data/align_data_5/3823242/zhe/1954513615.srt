1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,196
我们昨晚在铁板烧店碰见你妈了
Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,206
是啊  她超爱去那里
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:09,766
每次大厨把大虾翻炒到空中时
Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:12,626
她会一个飞扑上去叼住
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,396
所以我从不带她去海洋公园[喂海豚]
That's why I don't take her to the Seaworld.

6
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,426
我知道你不想听到这事
I know you don't want to hear it,

7
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,266
但是她是跟斯图尔特一起去的
but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:22,506
随便啊  我又无所谓
That's fine. I don't care.

9
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,396
他们出去约会你不会不爽吗
It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?

10
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:25,476
他们不是约会
They're not dating.

11
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,376
只是两个朋友一起出去吃饭
They're just two friends who went out to dinner.

12
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,336
吃完一起回他们共住的房子
And then went back to the home they share

13
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:31,446
没准睡觉时两人还穿着
where they probably fell asleep

14
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:32,956
你妈妈买的情侣睡衣
in the matching pajamas she got them

15
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,916
因为他们俩都喜欢企鹅
because they both just love penguins.

16
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:40,766
很多不是情侣的人也穿着情侣睡衣啊
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.

17
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:41,876
比如说
Like who?

18
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,896
你和你的狗
Like you and your dog.

19
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,556
话别说太早哦
Don't rule out the dating.

20
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:51,166
行  我心里超不爽
Fine, it bothers me.

21
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,186
你们高兴了吧
You happy?

22
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,246
你这问题算什么啊
You think you've got problems.

23
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:57,146
长臂猿是人猿总科中
The gibbon is the only member of the ape family

24
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:00,056
唯一不是大猿的猿类
not classified as a great ape.

25
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,266
你这话对我有啥帮助
How is this helpful?

26
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,316
所有非人类的猩猩
All the non-human apes are classified

27
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,286
全都归在人猿总科下的人科里
as great apes except one.

28
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,156
这就表示
That means

29
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:11,446
分类学家创造了小猿这个分类
taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape

30
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,296
来孤立可怜的长臂猿
just to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,716
他就像操场上被排挤的小孩
as the weird kid on the playground.

32
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:19,666
这些毛茸茸的小伙心中才是真不爽呢
Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,836
但是长臂猿们不知道自己被分类成什么
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:24,986
它们都不知道自己叫长臂猿
It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,246
这倒是
True.

36
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:29,646
抱歉  兄台  你比长臂猿还惨
Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.

37
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,996
电影之夜我们带零食来了
We brought snacks for movie night.

38
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:01,796
太好了
Oh, great.

39
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:04,366
你们不会顺便还带了餐巾纸  干净的碗
I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls,

40
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,386
餐具外加一卷厕纸吧
utensils and a roll of toilet paper.

41
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,126
还真带了
Right here.

42
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:10,786
你们最好了
You guys are the best.

43
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,056
这些衣服是怎么回事
What's with the clothes?

44
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,586
我为了工作买了不少职业装
Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work,

45
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:15,556
衣橱得清出一些空位啊
I needed to make room in my closet.

46
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,956
我是问这次衣服怎么是叠好的
I meant why are they folded?

47
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:18,346
不过随便吧
But whatever.

48
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,006
这件是干嘛的
Ooh, what's this?

49
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,946
说了怕你们不信  那是我当年的毕业舞会裙
That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

50
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,956
你还留着啊
Wow, you still have it?

51
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:28,456
我还以为会急忙中被揉成一团
I just assumed it was balled up

52
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:31,206
丢到谷仓的某个角落去了
in the corner of a barn somewhere.

53
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,896
你把我当年想成是哪种人了啊
What kind of teenager did you think I was?

54
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,506
-淫荡  -风骚
- Slutty. - Easy.

55
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:42,726
那是叫"受欢迎"好吗
The word is "popular."

56
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:45,776
你当年的舞会如何  你去了吗
How was your prom? Did you go?

57
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,606
没  但我去打扫了
No, but I was on clean-up crew.

58
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,346
太可怜了
Aw, that's sad.

59
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,676
不会  其实也还行
No, it was okay.

60
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,326
DJ在收工前  让我与我的拖把
The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop

61
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,196
共舞了一曲慢歌
before he shut down.

62
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:57,976
每当我看到一桶脏水
Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,

63
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:00,976
耳边还会响起那曲《红衣女郎》
I still hear "Lady in Red."

64
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,846
我当年的舞会也挺糟糕
My prom was pretty terrible, too.

65
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,276
当时我超兴奋那个男生来约我
I was so excited about my date,

66
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,486
结果发现他是为了泡我朋友
but it turned out he only asked me

67
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:09,956
所以才来约我
'cause he liked my friend.

68
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,986
他一整个晚上都在聊我的朋友
He spent the whole night talking about her.

69
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:14,086
行行行  你有朋友又有人约
Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date.

70
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,736
少显摆了好吗
Stop bragging.

71
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,606
无所谓啦
Doesn't matter.

72
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:18,846
毕业舞会蠢爆了
Prom is silly anyways.

73
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:19,786
你说当然容易
Easy for you to say;

74
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:22,096
你当年估计是跟橄榄球队队长一起去的
you probably went with the captain of the football team.

75
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,696
才不是
No.

76
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,096
我只是趁他的舞伴喝吐时
I just made out with him a little

77
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,016
偷偷跟他亲热了一番
while his date was puking.

78
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,996
那呕吐物就会是我的舞伴拖把来清理
My date would've had to clean that up.

79
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,886
我有个主意
Ooh, I have an idea.

80
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:36,606
我们可以来一个二次舞会啊
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

81
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,596
那应该会很好玩吧
Oh, that would be so much fun.

82
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:41,546
我们可以布置一下屋顶  让他们穿晚礼服
We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.

83
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:43,676
我们也去弄好头发  然后与他们跳慢舞
Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.

84
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,616
两位  相信我
Okay, guys, trust me,

85
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,456
作为去过大概有七场毕业舞会的人
as someone who's been to, like, seven proms,

86
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,766
舞会永远不会如你们想象中那般美好
it is never as good as you want it to be.

87
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:51,136
你去了七场舞会吗
You went to seven proms?

88
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:52,226
对  我想想
Yeah, let's see.

89
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:55,366
四场"深海主题"  两场"魔法奇缘"
Uh, four "Under the Seas," Two "Enchanted Evenings,"

90
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,026
一场"难忘之夜"
and one "Night to Remember"

91
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:59,886
那一夜我可是喝到一点都记不得
that... I cannot remember for the life of me.

92
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,766
伯纳黛特呢
Hey, where's Bernadette?

93
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,406
她跟艾米出去买舞会的礼服了
She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.

94
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,276
我有收到电邮邀请
Oh, yeah, I got that Evite.

95
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,646
我看完《红粉佳人》后
Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,

96
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:13,956
{\an8}1986年青春爱情校园电影
片中有毕业舞会桥段

97
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,956
我也好想参加美国人的毕业舞会
I've wanted to go to an American prom.

98
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:15,876
但看完《魔女嘉丽》
But then I saw Carrie,

99
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:18,706
{\an8}惊悚电影  有1976与2013两个版本  片中女主角在舞会上展开了一场大屠杀

100
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,806
我又一点都不想参加美国的毕业舞会了
and I did not want to go to an American prom.

101
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:20,626
但我又看了《一吻定江山》
But then I saw Never Been Kissed,

102
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:22,766
{\an8}1990年浪漫喜剧电影  也有浪漫舞会桥段

103
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,766
我又重新想参加毕业舞会了
and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

104
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:26,786
毕业舞会这事真让我的心大起大落啊
This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.

105
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:28,856
妮妮很兴奋呢
Bernie's really excited.

106
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,896
我知道她兴奋是因为她声音变超尖
I-I could tell because her voice got so high,

107
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,866
隔壁的狗听到都开始狗嚎了
the beagle next door started howling.

108
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,866
{\an8}高音容易使狗开始嚎叫

109
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:36,966
你有去毕业舞会吗
Did you go to your prom?

110
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,056
没
No.

111
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,856
因为我与当个好学生有个约会
I had a date with a proper education.

112
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:46,456
比起一身燕尾服  我养成一身好习惯
Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits.

113
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,786
比起掺了烈酒的潘趣酒
Instead of spiked punch,

114
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:49,786
{\an8}含酒精度较低的饮料酒

115
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:51,076
我更喜欢知识醉人的味道
I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

116
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,796
比起在体育馆里跳舞
Instead of dancing in a gym,

117
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,256
我更愿意随着AP微积分诱人的节奏
I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms...

118
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,416
够了够了
Okay, okay.

119
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,576
...抖屁股
...of AP Calculus.

120
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,036
你怎么没有跟艾米和伯纳黛特一起去采购呢
How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?

121
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,586
我来猜猜  你觉得这个舞会主意烂爆了
Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?

122
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,276
不要管我怎么想  你觉得如何
Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?

123
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,046
老实说
Hmm, to be honest,

124
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:13,176
即使这是个假的毕业舞会  但能有你这么美的舞伴
it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom

125
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,236
也算是美梦成真吧
with a woman as beautiful as you.

126
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,796
真是谢谢了
Ugh, thanks a lot.

127
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:19,376
怎么了
What?

128
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:22,956
要是我说不想参加  不就成了坏女人了吗
Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.

129
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,126
所以说她答应了
That sounds like a "Yes"!

130
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,826
每一位受邀的人都回复说参加
Ooh, every single person RSVP'd "Yes."

131
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:33,576
真是太让人激动了
This is so exciting!

132
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,916
你说是不是呀
Isn't this exciting?

133
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:40,426
是
Yep.

134
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,296
就连斯尔图特都要带舞伴来
Look, even Stuart's bringing a date.

135
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,376
真好奇那人是谁
I wonder who it is.

136
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,316
你明明知道那人是谁
You know exactly who it is.

137
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:47,426
我妈就是他的舞伴
He's gonna bring my mom.

138
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,946
你干嘛要邀请他啊
Why did you even invite him?

139
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,836
因为他是我们的朋友  你们俩必须和睦相处
Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along.

140
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:53,086
再说了  他为什么不能带你妈来
And why can't he take your mom?

141
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,436
你毕业舞会的时候不也带了吗
You took her to your prom.

142
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,716
我没有"带"她去  她是去"监护"我
I didn't "Take" her; she was a chaperone.

143
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,746
我见过一张你们一起跳舞的照片
I saw a picture of you two dancing together.

144
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:03,896
不能怪我
W-What was I gonna do?

145
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,146
当时在播我们爱的主打歌
They were playing our song!

146
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,636
我受不了了
I can't take this anymore.

147
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:14,326
你好
Hello.

148
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:15,906
斯尔图特  我们得谈谈
Stuart, we have to talk.

149
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:19,016
你跟我妈那点事儿
This thing with you and my mom,

150
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,466
让我超不爽
I-I hate it.

151
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,896
都快把我逼疯了
It's making me crazy.

152
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,536
你我是多年的朋友了
You and I were friends for years,

153
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,786
如今你却要带我妈去参加
and now you're bringing my mother to a party

154
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,136
我也在场的舞会
I'm going to?!

155
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,486
太离谱了吧
What the hell?!

156
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:32,816
我没有要带你妈去啊  我有其他舞伴
I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.

157
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:35,836
所以你现在是背着我妈偷吃吗
Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?

158
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,846
你在胡说什么呀
Wha-What are you talking about?

159
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:44,026
我和你妈之前完全不存在任何逾越之举
There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother.

160
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:47,776
图仔  你的洗澡水要凉了哦
Stewie, your bath is getting cold!

161
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,956
我得挂了  再见
I got to go, bye.

162
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:54,716
佩妮
Penny?

163
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:55,996
佩妮
Penny.

164
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:57,306
佩妮
Penny.

165
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:58,606
佩妮
Penny.

166
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,226
佩妮
Penny.

167
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:02,216
今天敲门的次数比平时多呀
You knocked more than usual.

168
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,676
下次我可能有急事
Next time I might be in a rush,

169
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,756
先多敲两下存着吧
it's good to have a few in the bank.

170
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,316
找我干嘛
Okay, what's up?

171
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:09,426
我想跟你讨论下
I'd like to discuss this party

172
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:11,606
艾米和伯纳黛特举办的这个舞会
that Amy and Bernadette are throwing.

173
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:14,076
既然我和你都不想参加
Since you and I are both reluctant to go,

174
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:17,746
我想到了一个让我们乐在其中的完美方法
I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.

175
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,196
好呀  怎么做
Great, how?

176
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,566
假装我们是外星人
We pretend we're aliens.

177
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,416
我不擅长阅读面部表情
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

178
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,476
但我猜你很喜欢这主意  并想深入了解它
but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more.

179
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,666
在受人喜爱的小说
Now, in the beloved novel

180
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,416
《银河系漫游指南》中
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

181
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,046
一位叫福特・派法特的外星人为了混进人类世界
an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human

182
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:39,296
假扮人类
in order to blend in

183
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,386
目的就是为替《银河系漫游指南》
so that he could write an entry about Earth

184
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:43,326
写一本地球指南
for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

185
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,086
而这本旅游指南恰恰是一本真书的一部分
which is a travel book within the actual book,

186
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,206
而那本真书名字就叫
which is also called

187
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:49,566
《银河系漫游指南》
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

188
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,746
我只有一个问题
Okay, just one question.

189
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,306
你说什么
What?

190
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:58,266
我的意思是  假装外星人
My point is, pretending to be an alien is

191
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:01,246
是我使用过多次非常有用的应对机制
a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times.

192
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:04,296
我第一次去看你演出时就用过
I did it the first time I went to see you in a play.

193
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,986
你根本不知道观众里有
You had no idea Commander Umfrumf

194
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,576
来自天镄堑闹富庸
of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience.

195
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:14,276
别担心  他竖起七根大拇指叫好哦
Oh, d-don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.

196
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,896
那么问题来了
Here's a question--

197
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,366
作为假扮人类的外星人
as an alien pretending to be human,

198
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,216
你打算跟艾米遵循
are you planning to engage in any

199
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:25,476
舞会后人类交配的惯例吗
post-prom mating rituals with Amy?

200
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:31,146
舞会后还有交配的惯例吗
There are post-prom mating rituals?

201
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:32,946
也不尽然啦
Not always.

202
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,296
但如果你舞伴的货车上有充气床垫
Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress,

203
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,726
那就是惯例啦
then always.

204
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:42,756
如果这是舞会体验的一部分  那我愿意接受
Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.

205
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,636
你开玩笑呢吧
You're kidding.

206
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:48,526
我或许是个外星人  但我也有冲动啊
I may be an alien, but I have urges.

207
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:52,806
如果艾米想交配  把卵子发射进太空
If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space,

208
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,516
那好  我很乐意用
well, then, I will happily catch them

209
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:57,846
我"上殖器"的生殖囊兜住它们
with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin.

210
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,826
虽然我不擅长阅读面部表情
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

211
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:07,296
但我能看出你有点小性奋哦
but I can see that you're a little turned on.

212
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,796
如果你懒得学怎么系领结
You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this,

213
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,686
有很多夹上去的领结也很漂亮
they make some pretty good clip-ons.

214
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,886
布鲁斯・韦恩[蝙蝠侠]才不用夹上去的领结
Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.

215
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:21,416
布鲁斯・韦恩也不会让他的室友帮忙系啊
Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.

216
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,776
他的室友[管家]阿福  会帮他系领带啊
His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.

217
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,816
好了  完美
There, perfect.

218
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:30,836
你确定吗
What, are you sure?

219
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,566
这是我人生第一场毕业舞会  我可得按照规矩来 
It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.

220
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,456
我以为你要打破常规扮外星人呢
I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.

221
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,916
我想来着  不过佩妮不想
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

222
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,726
你也不想
You didn't want to.

223
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,686
伯纳黛特  艾米
Bernadette, Amy,

224
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:43,196
库萨帕里和沃罗威茨都不想
Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to.

225
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,766
而连我都知道  请临演来会很怪
And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.

226
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:53,816
那是酒壶吗
Was that a flask?

227
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:54,906
是的
Yes.

228
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,966
我决定接受所有和舞会
I've decided to embrace all of the traditions

229
00:09:56,966 --> 00:10:00,376
相关的传统  包括在潘趣酒里掺烈酒
associated with prom, including spiking the punch.

230
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,336
你要在潘趣酒里掺烈酒
You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?

231
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,506
才不  这是石榴汁
Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.

232
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:09,426
用保护细胞老化的抗氧化物
It's all the fun of high school high jinks

233
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:12,326
来玩高中生寻欢作乐的游戏
with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.

234
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:16,336
如果你再穿上破烂的牛仔裤和皮夹克
If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket,

235
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,376
你就可以当迪士尼儿童台中的校霸了
you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel.

236
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:24,056
今晚还有什么安排吗
So, anything else planned for tonight?

237
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,476
舞会一切要做的事
Oh, everything.

238
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:28,326
跟大家照相  慢舞
Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing,

239
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,436
被选为舞会国王
being elected prom king.

240
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:35,036
再指正大家国王不是民选的
Pointing out that kings aren't elected.

241
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:39,366
到时候肯定爽翻天
It's gonna be off the hook.

242
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,266
既然你提起了
And while you're at it,

243
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,886
我知道在这个年龄你的荷尔蒙激增
I know that at this age your hormones are raging,

244
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,486
虽然你的朋友们都在嘿咻
but just because all your friends are having sex

245
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,396
不见得你也非得去做
doesn't mean you have to.

246
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,166
你何出此言
Why would you say that?

247
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,086
因为...
You know, 'cause...

248
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,716
很多人的初夜都是在毕业舞会上失去的
'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.

249
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:58,446
佩妮也暗示过这个
Penny implied the same thing.

250
00:10:58,446 --> 00:10:59,516
是真的吗
Is this true?

251
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:02,066
放轻松  我开玩笑的
Just relax, it's a joke.

252
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,326
你根本没有荷尔蒙
You don't have hormones.

253
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:17,896
你真漂亮
Wow, you look amazing.

254
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,066
谢谢  你也很帅
Thank you, so do you.

255
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:22,716
谢尔顿  你真帅气
Sheldon, you look so handsome.

256
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,716
谢谢
Thank you.

257
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,796
谢尔顿  艾米不漂亮吗
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

258
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,926
是不是让你的"上殖器"都活跃起来啦
That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.

259
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,186
什么东西
What's that?

260
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,926
那是长在他肩胛骨之间的
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ

261
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,626
鳞状生殖器
that grows between his shoulder blades.

262
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,746
跳舞的时候小心别碰着了
Try not to touch it when you're dancing.

263
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,156
失陪了
Excuse me.

264
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,126
你去哪里
Where are you going?

265
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,586
我做不到
I can't do this.

266
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,796
莱纳德  我告诉你
And for your information, Leonard,

267
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,886
"上殖器"不是长在我的肩胛骨之间
the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades,

268
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:51,346
而是从我脖子的肚脐孔上长出来的
it grows out of the belly button on my neck.

269
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,406
他说得对  我刚才说成"下殖器"了
He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.

270
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,766
我给斯图尔特发短信  说我们快到了
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.

271
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,496
你的纹身真好看
That's a neat tattoo.

272
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:08,626
谢谢  这是《圣诞夜惊魂》里的萨利
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.

273
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,326
那部电影很有趣
Aw, that movie's so cute.

274
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,356
你喜欢她  是因为你们都是红头发吗
Do you like her because you both have red hair?

275
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,956
不尽然  更多是因为她浑身伤疤
Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars

276
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,946
还可以把四肢都拆下来  然后重新缝上
and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.

277
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,846
我喜欢《灰姑娘》
I like Cinderella.

278
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:25,776
你知道在《灰姑娘》原书中
Did you know, in the original book,

279
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,756
灰姑娘的姐姐们为了能穿进水晶鞋
the sisters cut off their toes with knives

280
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:30,016
用刀把脚趾头砍了下来吗
in order to fit in the glass slipper?

281
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,786
我喜欢《魔咒歌》
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

282
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,786
{\an8}迪士尼动画电影《灰姑娘》中的歌曲

283
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,216
斯图尔特和他的女伴来了
Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.

284
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,466
她真可爱
Oh, she's cute.

285
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,216
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

286
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:41,886
怎么了
What?

287
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,146
那人是珍妮
That's Jeanie.

288
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,436
她就是珍妮吗
That's Jeanie?!

289
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:45,626
-珍妮是谁  -别说
- Who's Jeanie? - Don't say it.

290
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,346
霍华德以前睡过的那个堂姐
That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.

291
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:52,866
她是我的二等堂姐
She is my second cousin.

292
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:56,006
我们当时只有15岁  我叫你别说
We were 15... I just said, "don't say it."

293
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,146
没关系
No, it's okay.

294
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,816
他很早以前就告诉我了
He told me that story a long time ago.

295
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:00,736
拉杰
Raj!

296
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:01,736
那是我们第一次约会
It was our first date,

297
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:02,886
突然冷场了
there was an awkward silence.

298
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,936
我总得找话题说啊
What was I supposed to say?

299
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,376
好漂亮啊
Oh, it's beautiful.

300
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,896
她们俩布置得真漂亮
Oh, the girls really did a nice job.

301
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,286
我之前虽然不太感兴趣
I know I wasn't into this before,

302
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:21,266
不过我很高兴能带你来你的第一个舞会
but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.

303
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,256
你为什么觉得我没参加毕业舞会
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom?

304
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:25,176
-我去了  -你带了谁
- I went. - Well, who'd you go with?

305
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:29,326
我带的女伴名叫"孤独"
I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.

306
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:31,596
没事啦
Aw, it's all right.

307
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,076
我们最后和"丢脸"
We ended up having a threesome

308
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,906
来了个"三人大战"
with her friend humiliation, so...

309
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,456
如果我当时在场  看见你一个人
Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone,

310
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,606
我一定会邀请你跳舞
I would've asked you to dance.

311
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:41,626
不  你不会的
No, you wouldn't have.

312
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:42,686
你怎么知道
Well, you don't know that.

313
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,366
那时候我还没发育呢
It was before my growth spurt.

314
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,916
什么  你现在是发育过了吗
What, that already happened?

315
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,546
真好笑
Very funny.

316
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,006
不过你肯定也不会邀请我
Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.

317
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:52,506
我肯定会邀请你
I would have asked you.

318
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,906
在我脑子里
In my head.

319
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,886
在回家的路上
On the way home.

320
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:00,856
大哭的时候邀请你
While I was having a good cry.

321
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,976
谢尔顿  我能进来吗
Sheldon, can I come in?

322
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:11,086
我觉得还是算了吧
I don't think that's a good idea.

323
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,396
为什么
Why not?

324
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:14,116
根据网上的留言板说
According to an online message board,

325
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:16,196
我可能是恐慌症犯了
I may be having a panic attack.

326
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:19,706
"足球妈妈09"也有同样的症状
SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms.

327
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,326
不过说实话  她的双胞胎那天的确很不乖
But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.

328
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,276
你让我很担心
You're making me worry.

329
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:27,746
到底怎么回事
What's going on?

330
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:31,386
事情是我们要去参加毕业舞会
What's going on is we're about to go to a prom.

331
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,896
对我们这样的青年情侣来说
And there's a great deal of pressure

332
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,996
要做到鲍勃・尤班克斯
on young couples like us to engage in

333
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:38,376
{\an8}美国新婚游戏节目主持人

334
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:38,376
说的那样"肆意狂欢"  有很大压力
what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.

335
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:40,416
什么压力
What pressure?

336
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,146
我不过就说了你好帅
All I said was you look handsome.

337
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,116
把门打开好吗
Can you please open the door?

338
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,586
不光是这样
It's not just that.

339
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,436
莱纳德和佩妮也说了这事
Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.

340
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,026
我又不是瞎子
And I'm not blind.

341
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:53,386
我都忍不住多看两眼我的翘臀
Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior

342
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,676
裹在礼服裤里的样子
in these tuxedo pants.

343
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,236
我跟珍妮相识于你阿姨格拉蒂家
So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.

344
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,706
她递给我犹太典礼酒
She passed me the Manischewitz,

345
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:03,356
我看了这犹太美女一眼
I took one look at this punim,

346
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,986
差点犹太式"喷"到犹太布丁上
and I almost plotzed on the kugel.

347
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,506
我谈论印度时也这么烦人吗
Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?

348
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,816
我妈对此没意见吗
So, my mother's okay with this?

349
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:18,396
你妈干嘛对我和斯图尔特有意见
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?

350
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:21,606
因为他们之间存在着不恰当的逾越之举
'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.

351
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:25,146
比咱俩在我爸车里"做"的事还逾越吗
Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?

352
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,476
真是太"糟糕"了
This is so messed up.

353
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,916
我知道  我看得好开心啊
I know, I'm having the best time.

354
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,116
你今天为什么要来
Why would you even come to this?

355
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,806
你不是知道我也会在场吗
Didn't you know I'd be here?

356
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:38,746
那事都过去多久了  霍华德
It was a long time ago, Howard.

357
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,106
而且你俩是二等堂姐弟  有啥关系
And you're only second cousins, who cares?

358
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,106
{\an8}珍妮与霍华德关系为同房远堂  也就是外国人眼中二等堂(second cousin)

359
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,576
你明知道这事还非要带她来吗
So, you knew and you brought her anyway?

360
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,396
霍德华能上她  我却不能上吗
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?!

361
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:46,986
没错
Yeah.

362
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:48,446
滚回家和你自己妈妈
Yeah, go have weird relationships

363
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:49,776
堂姐玩不伦去吧
with your own mother and cousin.

364
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:50,656
这是他的地盘
This is his turf.

365
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,146
说得对
Yeah.

366
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,816
我之前没请你跳舞
Well, I might not have asked you to dance then,

367
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:00,676
-现在让我邀请你吧  -可是没音乐啊
- but I will ask you now. - There's no music.

368
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,646
我不管
I don't care.

369
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,276
咱们自己制造音乐嘛
We'll make our own music.

370
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,356
瞧瞧  现在谁像个傻瓜啊
My God, who's the dork now?

371
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,416
谢谢你穿了平跟鞋
Thank you for wearing your flats.

372
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,106
谢谢你穿了高跟鞋
Thank you for wearing your heels.

373
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,026
看我多有出息
Look at me.

374
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:26,246
和舞会中最美的姑娘一起跳舞
Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.

375
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,106
想不想拍张合影发给
Want to take a picture of us and send it

376
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,366
你象棋俱乐部的朋友啊
to your old friends in the chess club?

377
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:34,126
我几年前就把你的泳装照发给他们了
I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago.

378
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:39,336
这样真好
This is nice.

379
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,056
我都有点希望其他人不来了
I kind of wish no one else was coming.

380
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,326
我也这么想
I know, me, too.

381
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:48,516
但能过个不混乱的毕业舞会也不错
But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.

382
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:52,976
华仔  放开他
Howie, get off of him!

383
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:56,736
除非这只猪不再专拱我家的白菜
Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree!

384
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:00,726
谢尔顿  你太傻了
Sheldon, this is silly.

385
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,266
我不要又错过一次舞会
I'm not missing another prom.

386
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,466
我要上楼去了
I'm going upstairs now.

387
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:04,886
回见
Good-bye.

388
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:08,466
我真心觉得你今天很美
I really did think you looked pretty.

389
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,136
真的吗
You did?

390
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:11,506
真的
Yes.

391
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:15,016
惊艳到让我开始恐慌
So much so that I started to panic.

392
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,846
你不用紧张
Well, you can relax.

393
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,496
就算你觉得我很美
Just because you think I look pretty

394
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,256
也不代表我们今晚就要在一起
doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.

395
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:26,446
可这是舞会  你不就想这样吗
Were you hoping we would because it's prom?

396
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,756
我一直都想
I'm always hoping.

397
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:33,826
但今晚我只想好好和你享受舞会
But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you.

398
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,916
或许还能跟有手臂的生物跳舞
And maybe dance with someone who has arms.

399
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:41,166
谢谢你理解我
Thank you for understanding.

400
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,436
我当然理解
Of course I understand.

401
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,946
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

402
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:50,076
有些话我一直想告诉你
there's something else I've been wanting to say,

403
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,796
在说之前  我...
but before I do, I just...

404
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:55,536
我想让你明白  你不用回复我
I want you to know that you don't have to say it back.

405
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,796
我知道你还没准备好
I know you're not ready,

406
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,716
所以我不希望你
and I don't want you to say it

407
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,576
仅仅因为社交规矩而说出来
just because social convention dictates...

408
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:02,326
我也爱你
I love you, too.

409
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,516
你说出来了
You said it.

410
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,846
我对你有着不可否认
There's no denying I have feelings for you

411
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:13,436
又无法用其他途径解释的好感
that can't be explained in any other way.

412
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:18,256
我曾以为自己脑子里长了寄生虫
I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite.

413
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,906
但那个理由更牵强
But that seems even more farfetched.

414
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,736
唯一的结论  这就是爱
The only conclusion was love.

415
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,636
我知道你怎么了
I know what's happening.

416
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,846
你这是恐慌发作
This is a panic attack.

417
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:40,516
"足球妈妈09"说要双腿抬高马上躺下
SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.

418
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:41,896
好的
Okay.

419
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,856
虽然我说了我爱你
Just because I love you doesn't mean

420
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:47,166
但不代表女生可以进我房间啊
girls are allowed in my room.

421
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,316
好了
Okay.

422
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,496
照相啦
Here we go...

423
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:06,496
说"茄子"
Say "Cheese"!

424
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:11,236
说"田七"
Say "Cheese"!

425
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,276
说"堂姐"
Say "Cousin"!

426
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,406
说
Say...

427
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,306
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

428
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,246
等一下  抱歉
Hang on, sorry.

429
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,756
黛比
Hey, Debbie.

430
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,676
我...是的  我和珍妮在一起
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie.

431
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,486
可我和她只是朋友
Okay, but we're just friends.

432
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:36,596
只是...  好吧
It's... Yeah.

433
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:37,876
我得赶紧走了
I got to go.
