1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:05,838
              AMY:
 So, Sheldon, there's something
I've been wanting to talk about.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,673
        But I know it's
   kind of a touchy subject.

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,742
Way to narrow it down
to everything.

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,877
          What is it?

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,379
Well, your birthday's coming up.

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,680
        And you've never
      let us celebrate it.

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,515
          And I was hoping maybe
             this year we could.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,718
Oh, I suppose that's
a discussion we could have.

9
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,492
      Okay, great, I mean,

10
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,194
     it doesn't have to be
    a big party or anything.

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,263
         I was just...

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,334
Where'd he go?

13
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,568
        W-Wait a minute.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,837
    You mention his birthday
        and he vanishes?

15
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:42,041
Well, where's that information
been this whole time?

16
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,979

24
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,772
       Well, where is he?

25
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,007
Sheldon?

26
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,075
      I'll check his room.

27
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,443
                   Surprise!
(both scream)

28
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,577
                     Oh, my God!

29
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,579
        Just one example

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,082
        of how birthdays
        can be terrible.

31
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,517
       Now, can we please

32
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,718
       drop this subject
      and pick a new one?

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,288
        Yeah, I suggest
   "how thick can a soup get

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,756
   before it becomes a stew?"

35
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,225
     You know, the answer,
      it may surprise you.

36
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,061
   I'm sorry I brought it up.

37
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,362
   Yeah, what is the problem?

38
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,430
   Is it about getting older?

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,699
            Please, look at this
                 porcelain skin.

40
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,502
          I'm like a human sink.

41
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:48,707
But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.

42
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,709
            One day.
            (laughs)

43
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,214
             Right.

44
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,384
Can you please just tell me why?

45
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,454
                      Fine.

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,756
                    As you know,
            I have a twin sister

47
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,126
           with whom I obviously
               share a birthday.

48
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,094
                 Every year we'd
                   have a party.

49
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,796
        No one I invited
        would ever come,

50
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,897
  because they didn't like me.

51
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,733
           I'm sorry.

52
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,068
    Oh, that part wasn't so bad.

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,302
     I didn't like them, either.

54
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,937
   But then I'd inevitably spend

55
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,608
    the whole day being tortured
         by my sister's friends.

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,510
             Oh, you poor thing.

57
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,745
    When I was six, they told me
  Batman was coming to my party.

58
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,814
                 I waited by the
                 door for hours.

59
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,816
                   Closest thing
                 to Batman I saw

60
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,885
                was when a robin
           flew into the window.

61
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,356
You realize none of those things
would happen now?

62
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,324
       I do, but why do you care

63
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,426
                  if I celebrate
             my birthday at all?

64
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,630
Well, you made
my last birthday so memorable,

65
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,632
I wanted to return the favor.

66
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,633
PENNY:
Yeah, if you had

67
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,134
                a party now, you
          have plenty of friends

68
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,435
        that would love to come.

69
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,937
And we live here,
so we have no choice.

70
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,772
                     Yeah.

71
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,675
                      Very well.

72
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,644
       You may celebrate my life
             by throwing a party

73
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,713
       with cake, presents and a
  shower of admiration and love.

74
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,782
   But then you owe me big-time.

75
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,487
You have any idea
what you're getting

76
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,821
   Sheldon for his birthday?

77
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,890
      He's been fascinated
     with dinosaurs lately.

78
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,458
Maybe we could get him a fossil.

79
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,494
        Well, just don't
     get anything Jurassic.

80
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,797
 He feels like that whole chunk
  of time has gone Hollywood.

81
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,734
       Hey, uh, you know,

82
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,504
      he told a sad story
      about how his sister

83
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,874
tricked him into thinking Batman
    was coming to his party.

84
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,042
         That's funny.

85
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,810
         Let's do that.

86
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,480
   Maybe we could get Batman
      to actually show up.

87
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,983
              You mean, some guy
                 in a lame suit?

88
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,252
       Or a real Batman.
          Hey, Stuart?

89
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,754
Didn't you try to get Adam West
   to do a signing here once?

90
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,390
  Yeah, but there was kind of
     a scheduling conflict.

91
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,193
          He, uh, wanted to know
             when he'd get paid.

92
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,962
        And I wouldn't tell him.

93
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,732
  Can I get his contact info?

94
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,867
                   Sure, uh, but
               just so you know,

95
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,369
            he's kind of a diva.

96
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,238
He is?
                       Oh, yeah.

97
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,339
             Won't take the bus.

98
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,773
    He won't pack his own lunch.

99
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,910
      Won't let you spend
    the night on his couch.

100
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,282
        Okay, so how do you feel
           about party balloons?

101
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,883
    Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.

102
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,619
      Latex balloons, no.

103
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,787
        Water balloons,
    I will jump off the roof

104
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,856
     and aim for your car.

105
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,926
    All right, what about music?

106
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,427
     I enjoy marching bands

107
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,097
  and Tibetan throat singing.

108
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,465
                 No music it is.

109
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,234
What kind of cake
do you like?

110
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,070
 Well, my favorite is chocolate
   with strawberry frosting,

111
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,972
three layers,
and if there's

112
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,907
         writing on it,
  make sure it's not all caps.

113
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,044
    I don't need my dessert
         yelling at me.

114
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,316
        Hey, so what was
  Adam West like on the phone?

115
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,784
         Uh, nice guy.

116
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,452
   But it was a little weird
      to hear Batman say,

117
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,323
    "Don't ring the doorbell
 or my poodles will go crazy."

118
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,259
      You know, Adam West
     is my favorite Batman?

119
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,727
             Well,

120
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,896
           after Michael Keaton,
                  Christian Bale

121
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,998
                and Batman from
                <i> The Lego Movie.</i>

122
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,934
     Don't say that to him.

123
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,103
             What?
  He beat out George Clooney.

124
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,171
           And that's something.

125
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,573
                 Like, I love me
                   some Clooney.

126
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,876
   Don't say that to anyone.

127
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,514
       Thank you so much
    for helping us, Stuart.

128
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,182
                Oh, I-I was just

129
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,817
      glad to be invited.

130
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,787
  To be honest, I don't always
feel like I'm part of the group.

131
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,021
Okay, sweetie,
we're on the clock here.

132
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,657
Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?

133
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,992
          (door opens)

134
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,428
Hello, I hope I'm not too early.

135
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,462
    No, no, no. Come on in.

136
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,831
     And how is the radiant
          mommy-to-be?

137
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,433
          Doing great.

138
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,468
       Y-You're pregnant?

139
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,436
                     Yeah.

140
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,504
     Sounds like something

141
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,341
     a member of the group
          might know.

142
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,675
Yeah, birthday party first.

143
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,577
Pity party later.

144
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,548
         Are you crazy?

145
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,183
 How can you put Michael Keaton

146
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,552
  in front of Christian Bale?

147
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,620
Oh, please.

148
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,226
      Even my poodles know
       Bale's overrated.

149
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,362
           Thank you!

150
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,297
        That's why I say
      Keaton's number one.

151
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,865
       He brought a sense
     of humor to the role.

152
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,900
      Oh, if you're gonna
  factor in a sense of humor,

153
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,070
        then I should be
    at the top of the list.

154
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,873
It should be me,

155
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,074
Keaton, Kilmer,

156
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,876
          Lego, Bale,

157
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,945
  and that pretty boy Clooney.

158
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,815
                   Really?

159
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,317
     You're ahead of Bale?

160
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,386
    The man who personified
           the words,

161
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,255
         (deep voice):
         "I'm Batman."

162
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,023
 I never had to say I'm Batman.

163
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,024
          I showed up.

164
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,427
   People knew I was Batman.

165
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,164
Everywhere I went--
on the TV show,

166
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,399
mall openings...

167
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,468
    Julie Newmar's bungalow.

168
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,607
I'm sold-- you're ahead of Bale.

169
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,377
There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.

170
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,045
All those other guys

171
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,082
       had muscles built
      into their costumes.

172
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,251
    All I had in my Batsuit

173
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,088
    was 100%, grade-A West.

174
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,593
        Can we just all agree
    we're worried about Affleck?

175
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,495
                           Sure.
      Yeah, of course.

176
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,932
       What's an Affleck?

177
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,738
         Is there a reason I had
      to leave my own apartment?

178
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,306
         Well, I think
  they just want you to see it

179
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,074
       for the first time
         all decorated.

180
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,611
       But who's gonna tell them
         they're doing it wrong?

181
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,948
 Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll
   ask you to give a speech,

182
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,484
        and that's when
  you just tear 'em a new one.

183
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:35,420
Have to say, you...

184
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,322
 you do look good in that suit.

185
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,824
         Oh. Thank you.

186
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,126
    Maybe later I'll, uh...

187
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,529
         get to see you
     in your birthday suit.

188
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,468
                  But this<i> is</i> my
                  birthday suit.

189
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,705
    Are you having a stroke?

190
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,475
Because that's the kind of thing

191
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,809
        that just ruins
       a birthday party.

192
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,981
   So, Mother, I'm surprised
     you came all this way

193
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,149
    for Sheldon's birthday.

194
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,016
      Oh, I was happy to.

195
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,018
    He did come to my 60th.

196
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,022
        Oh. You had a party
           for your 60th?

197
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,191
Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.

198
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,227
   Just a few close friends.

199
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,430
  And your sister and brother.

200
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,301
You know, to be fair,
we did get married in Vegas

201
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,436
and didn't invite her.

202
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,072
   And I never did thank you
        for that, dear.

203
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,776
        (ringtone plays)
AMY:
Oh.

204
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,846
Penny says everyone's there.
Are you ready?

205
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,082
      (takes deep breath)
             I am.

206
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,125
   Oh. Wait.
              Are you all right?

207
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,828
         No, I just...
  I got a little light-headed.

208
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,196
  Oh, d-do you need a minute?

209
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,298
      (exhales)
         No.

210
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,700
No, if I can walk
past that pet shop

211
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,070
with the parrot in the window,
I suppose I can do this.

212
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,578
            OTHERS:
        Happy birthday!

213
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,313
      (whooping, clapping)

214
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,581
            Speech! Speech!

215
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,551
               Come on, Sheldon,
                  say something.

216
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,852
        Uh, um...

217
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,221
uh, thank you all
so much for coming.

218
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,522
Uh, Beverly.

219
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,558
Wil Wheaton.

220
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,993
Adam West,
for some reason.

221
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,064
      Batman finally came
         to your party.

222
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,833
    Happy birthday, Sherman.

223
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,505
SHELDON:
Thank you.

224
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,373
This is all so thoughtful.

225
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,109
  (heartbeat thumping loudly)

226
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,784
           (panting):
           Excuse me.

227
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,026
   I still get paid, don't I?

228
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,135
          Okay, I'd better go in
          there and talk to him.

229
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,104
     Well, don't you think
 I'm the one who should go in?

230
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,974
   No offense, but I've known
  the guy a really long time.

231
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,875
Well, I've, you know,

232
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,345
   seen him without pants on.

233
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,549
       Again, no offense,
         but so have I.

234
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,784
       Well, he's seen me
       without pants on.

235
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,752
          Again, no...

236
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,821
   Okay, this is ridiculous.

237
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,091
           (knocking)

238
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:26,958
Sheldon?

239
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,959
Can I come in?

240
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,260
            (sighs)

241
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,097
 How do you know I'm not using
        the facilities?

242
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,799
   Because you e-mail me your
 bathroom schedule once a week,

243
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,134
          even though
   I've clicked unsubscribe,

244
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,669
    like, a thousand times.

245
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,677
So...

246
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,245
        what's going on?

247
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,780
         I don't know.

248
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,482
  I-I looked around the room,

249
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,517
    and I saw all the faces
       and the presents,

250
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,853
and it... it was just too much.

251
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,355
          I get that.

252
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,327
Hey, you want to just bring
a few people in here?

253
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,162
You know,
Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,

254
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,464
Batman on the toilet.

255
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,433
         It'll be like
  the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

256
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,772
  I know that you worked hard
     to put this together.

257
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,140
   I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

258
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,541
Oh, pl...
You're not ruining it.

259
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,510
      Look, at some point,
  Raj will try to get everyone

260
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,844
   to do the Electric Slide.

261
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,346
    Now, that will ruin it.

262
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,550
         I don't think
    I can go back out there.

263
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,253
          That's fine.

264
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,167
You know, I hate that
your sister and her friends

265
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,302
used to torture you.

266
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,237
But what I hate even more

267
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,474
is, if I was there,
I would have tortured you, too.

268
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,846
         Based on this pep talk,
  I'd say you're still doing it.

269
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,215
(scoffs)
My point is,

270
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,184
there was a time I never
would've been friends

271
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,386
with someone like you,
and now...

272
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,321
you are one
of my favorite people.

273
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,523
So, if what you need is

274
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,326
to spend your birthday
in a bathroom,

275
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,329
I'm happy to do it with you.

276
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,233
             Well, everyone will
                think I'm weird.

277
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,476
Sweetie, you are weird.

278
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,612
Everyone knows you're weird,

279
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,013
but they're all still here

280
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,449
because they care
about you so much.

281
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,717
           (knocking)

282
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,852
KRIPKE:
Hello.

283
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,386
Some of us need
to check our hair

284
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,156
because we might have a shot
with Leonard's mother.

285
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,361
Leonard.
              Hey.

286
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,729
It's been a while.

287
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,897
                         Leslie.

288
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,432
        I can't remember
    the last time we talked.

289
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,167
      So much has changed.

290
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,138
            Has it?

291
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,641
         Yeah, uh, um,
    Penny and I got married.

292
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,209
     Wow, congratulations.

293
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,377
      You know, actually,

294
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,246
   I thought you'd be living
     with Sheldon forever.

295
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,981
         Yeah, well...

296
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,017
      Don't be a stranger.

297
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,220
        Okay, everybody,

298
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,388
Sheldon is gonna come back out,

299
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,756
          but I think
   he's a little embarrassed,

300
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,259
        so let's all be
       extra nice, okay?

301
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,760
What are you
looking at me for?

302
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,295
I'm a saint. (chuckles)

303
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,164
But a sinner in the sack.

304
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,469
        Hello, everyone.

305
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,637
             I-I...

306
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,505
     I'd like to apologize
        for my behavior.

307
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,441
      I hope it hasn't put
     a damper on the party.

308
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,310
       So, just, please,
       enjoy yourselves.

309
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,478
              That's good.

310
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,915
    (party chatter resumes)

311
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,317
             Oh, this is quickly
            getting out of hand.

312
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,419
If I may,

313
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,588
I-I'd like to propose a toast.

314
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,024
Um, thank you all
for coming tonight.

315
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,258
I know it's customary

316
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,161
      for the birthday boy
      to receive presents,

317
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,363
     but I feel like I got
       the greatest gift

318
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,665
      the day he was born.

319
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,699
              ALL:
              Aw.

320
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,701
                     Hear, hear.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Cheers.

321
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,137
     Amy, that was lovely.

322
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,471
                       You know,

323
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,472
                    this is fun.

324
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,774
                  Let's do more.

325
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,143
      Someone else say something
             wonderful about me.

326
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,512
          Sheldon,
 I don't think everyone...

327
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,380
       Wolowitz, perfect.
  Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

328
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,383
Okay, then, uh, (clears throat)

329
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,452
      Sheldon, (chuckles)

330
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,954
     we've known each other
          a long time.

331
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,324
      And it is a pleasure
        to work with you

332
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,025
    and call you my friend.

333
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,560
 Little generic. Keep thinking.
       We'll circle back.

334
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,062
                Wil Wheaton, go.

335
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,000
 Sheldon, I know that we've had
       our ups and downs,

336
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,135
but I can honestly say

337
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,503
        that my life is
    so much more interesting

338
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,805
     because you are in it.

339
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:37,408
We may have met because
you are a fan of<i> Star Trek.</i>

340
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,711
       But I have become
    a fan of Sheldon Cooper.

341
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,412
Live long and prosper,
buddy.

342
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,547
      And happy birthday.

343
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,815
              ALL:
            Cheers.

344
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,150
That's how you do it, Wolowitz.

345
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,186
Now you see

346
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,621
why he's famous and you're not.

347
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,524
                        Sheldon,

348
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,160
    I know the future holds
     great things for you,

349
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,763
  and we all can't wait to see
         what they are.

350
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,099
     Happy birthday, dear.

351
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,901
              ALL:
            Cheers.

352
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,569
Someone call Animal Control.

353
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,905
There's a cougar on the loose.

354
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,707
          Barry, stop.

355
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,342
Seriously, Barry, stop.

356
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,581
  And it was Gandhi who said,

357
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,750
    "Live as if you were to

358
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,019
"die tomorrow.

359
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,554
"Learn as if you were to live

360
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,889
           forever."

361
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,591
   And it was Sheldon Cooper who
      said "Let's speed this up.

362
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,927
  A lot of people want to talk."

363
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,796
Uh, in the past, I would've said
      something obnoxious,

364
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,065
like, "Happy birthday, dumbass."

365
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,200
But I'm not gonna do it.

366
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,902
You and I have both grown a lot,

367
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,538
     and it's just so nice
     to see you all again.

368
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,773
So...

369
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,308
    happy birthday, Sheldon.

370
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,442
              Oh.

371
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,477
Oh, now, you know I hate change.
            Say it.

372
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,279
    Happy birthday, dumbass!

373
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,048
           (cheering)

374
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,649
Happy birthday, young man.

375
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,320
And if any of you have enjoyed
seeing me here today,

376
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,922
       I'm also available
        for Comic-Cons,

377
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,059
       bachelor parties,
        bar mitzvahs...

378
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,462
I can't think of anything to say
 that hasn't already been said.

379
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,798
  So, here's to you, Sheldon.

380
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,166
Hear, hear.
          Hear, hear.

381
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,500
     Thank you, Bernadette.

382
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,568
       That was perfect.

383
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,305
What? You gotta be kidding me?

384
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,574
             Sheldon, we've been
               together so long,

385
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,310
  it's hard to remember a time
    you weren't in my life.

386
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,645
     And believe me, I try.

387
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,647
(laughter)

388
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,815
       You make me laugh.

389
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,117
You make me a better scientist.

390
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,585
              You make me crazy.

391
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,253
     You're more than just
          my roommate,

392
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,722
       you're my brother.

393
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,790
           Thank you.

394
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,325
     Happy birthday, buddy.

395
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,893
              ALL:
            Cheers.

396
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,863
                      Thank you.
        That-that was wonderful.

397
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:39,864
                          PENNY:
           Oh, wait, wait, wait.

398
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,666
     Stuart didn't get to speak.

399
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,135
Oh, oh, okay. Um...

400
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,037
                    Uh, Sheldon,

401
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,039
I've spent most of my life
feeling invisible,

402
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,141
but having you and everyone...

403
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,943
Hey, everybody, listen up.

404
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,114
                  You nailed it.

405
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,049
We've got someone
who couldn't be here

406
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,350
but really wanted to wish you

407
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,852
a happy birthday.

408
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,221
        Hello, Sheldon.

409
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,655
            (gasps)

410
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,491
       Professor Hawking.
                 (chuckles)

411
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,526
     Happy birthday to you.

412
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,794
Thank you so much.

413
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,795
I can't believe you're...

414
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,996
     Happy birthday to you.

415
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,032
Oh, you're singing.
Well, I'm sorry.

416
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,635
 Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.

417
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,836
                        LEONARD:
          Uh, Professor Hawking,

418
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,538
             if you just give us
                     one second,

419
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,007
        we'll light the candles,
   and we can all sing together.

420
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,077
       I was crushing it,
         but all right.

421
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
            Okay, while they get
                       the cake,

422
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,581
                        Sheldon,
             I just want to say,

423
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,250
I hope you didn't think you were
   gonna get through tonight

424
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,351
         without a hug.

425
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,519
            (sighs)

426
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,054
    You know, I used to hate
          these hugs.

427
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,659
        Now they're just
     extremely irritating.

428
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,667
             Ready when you are,
              Professor Hawking.

429
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,403
    And a one, and a two...

430
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:57,075
   ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

431
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:02,280

           (cheering)

436
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,370
   So, who's taking me home?
