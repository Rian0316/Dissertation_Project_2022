1
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,436
Sheldon 有件事我一直想说
So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,337
但我知道那是个敏感话题
but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,540
好像有什么话题是不敏感的一样
Way to narrow it down to everything.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,543
是什么事?
What is it?

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,877
你的生日快到了
Well, your birthday's coming up.

6
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,078
你从不让我们替你庆祝
And you've never let us celebrate it.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,014
我希望今年也许能庆祝一下
And I was hoping maybe this year we could.

8
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:20,317
我觉得这话题我们可以讨论一下
Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,157
那太好了 我是说
Okay, great, I mean,

10
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,760
并不一定要办个大派对什么的
it doesn't have to be a big party or anything.

11
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,962
我只是...
I was just...

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,899
他去哪儿了?
Where'd he go?

13
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,067
等... 等等
W... wait a minute.

14
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:39,469
你一提他的生日 他就消失了?
You mention his birthday and he vanishes?

15
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,773
以前怎么没人告诉我可以这样?
Well, where's that information been this whole time?

16
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:47,477
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,814
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

18
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:52,449
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

19
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,985
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

20
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,654
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

21
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:00,324
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

22
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,226
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

23
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,827

28
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:17,806
Sheldon 你在哪儿?
Sheldon?

29
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:18,841
我去他房间看看
I'll check his room.

30
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:20,175
惊喜!
Surprise!

31
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:21,310
天啊!
Oh, my God!

32
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,279
我只是举例说明
Just one example

33
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,881
生日派对有多可怕
of how birthdays can be terrible.

34
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,150
听着 我们能不能
Now, can we please

35
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,518
结束这个话题 换个新的?
drop this subject and pick a new one?

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,054
我提议"在汤变成浓汁前
Yeah, I suggest "how thick can a soup get

37
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,556
最稠能有多稠?"
before it becomes a stew?"

38
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,991
要知道 答案可能让你大吃一惊
You know, the answer, it may surprise you.

39
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,861
我提了这个话题 真对不起
I'm sorry I brought it up.

40
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:40,095
这话题有什么问题?
Yeah, what is the problem?

41
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,130
是因为觉得自己变老了吗?
Is it about getting older?

42
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,566
拜托 看看我这精致的皮肤
Please, look at this porcelain skin.

43
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,368
简直光彩照人
I'm like a human sink.

44
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:51,574
但这是你每年一次的专属日啊
But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.

45
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:53,542
就一次
One day.

46
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,147
没错
Right.

47
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:02,051
你能告诉我原因吗?
Can you please just tell me why?

48
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:05,120
好吧
Fine.

49
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:07,289
你也知道 我有个双胞胎妹妹
As you know, I have a twin sister

50
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,792
她的生日显然和我是同一天
with whom I obviously share a birthday.

51
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,827
每年我们都会办派对
Every year we'd have a party.

52
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,395
我请的人从不会来参加
No one I invited would ever come,

53
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:14,830
因为他们不喜欢我
because they didn't like me.

54
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,566
别难过了
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,801
我倒不是很伤心
Oh, that part wasn't so bad.

56
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,002
反正我也不喜欢他们
I didn't like them, either.

57
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:21,670
但我就没法避免
But then I'd inevitably spend

58
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:25,240
那一整天都被我妹妹的朋友折磨
the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.

59
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,142
真可怜
Oh, you poor thing.

60
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,478
我六岁那年 他们跟我说蝙蝠侠会来参加我的派对
When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,347
我在门口等了好几个小时
I waited by the door for hours.

62
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,382
结果我看到唯一和蝙蝠侠有关的
Closest thing to Batman I saw was when

63
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,618
就是一只知更鸟飞进了窗户
a robin flew into the window.

64
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,618
{\an8}知更鸟和蝙蝠侠的伙伴罗宾都是robin

65
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:40,055
你应该知道现在不会有这些事了吧?
You realize none of those things would happen now?

66
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,957
我知道 但你干嘛在乎
I do, but why do you care

67
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,093
我过不过生日呢?
if I celebrate my birthday at all?

68
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:47,296
你把我上一个生日变得超级难忘
Well, you made my last birthday so memorable,

69
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:49,264
我想报答你
I wanted to return the favor.

70
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,432
没错 如果这次
Yeah, if you had

71
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,900
你先办派对 你有很多朋友
a party now, you have plenty of friends

72
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:53,102
超级想来参加的
that would love to come.

73
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,703
而且我们就住这儿 反正别无选择
And we live here, so we have no choice.

74
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,739
没错
Yeah.

75
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,241
好吧
Very well.

76
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,210
你可以庆祝我的生日 办个派对
You may celebrate my life by throwing a party

77
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,279
准备蛋糕礼物 让它充满赞美和爱
with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love.

78
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,482
但这样你就欠了我个大人情
But then you owe me big-time.

79
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,086
你想好要送Sheldon
You have any idea what you're getting

80
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,488
什么生日礼物了吗?
Sheldon for his birthday?

81
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,657
他最近痴迷于恐龙
He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately.

82
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,025
也许我们应该送他块化石
Maybe we could get him a fossil.

83
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,027
别选侏罗纪的东西
Well, just don't get anything Jurassic.

84
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,497
他觉得那一整段时期都被好莱坞承包了
He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood.

85
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,434
嘿 听我说
Hey, uh, you know,

86
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:28,103
他讲了他妹妹骗他说
he told a sad story about how his sister

87
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:31,407
蝙蝠侠会参加他的生日派对的悲惨故事
tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.

88
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,741
真有趣
That's funny.

89
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,510
我们拿这个骗他吧
Let's do that.

90
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,013
或者我们真的请蝙蝠侠来
Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.

91
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,616
你是说 找个人扮一下?
You mean, some guy in a lame suit?

92
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:42,885
是真的蝙蝠侠 Stuart?
Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart?

93
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,454
你不是有次请了Adam West过来签售吗?
Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?

94
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,956
对 但当时行程安排出了点问题
Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict.

95
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,893
他想知道什么时候能拿到钱
He, uh, wanted to know when he'd get paid.

96
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,828
但我偏不告诉他
And I wouldn't tell him.

97
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,231
能给我他的联系方式吗?
Can I get his contact info?

98
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,634
当然 但提醒你一下
Sure, uh, but just so you know,

99
00:03:58,636 --> 00:03:59,968
他这人特别事儿
he's kind of a diva.

100
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,837
- 是吗?  - 可不呢
- He is?  - Oh, yeah.

101
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,938
不肯坐公交车
Won't take the bus.

102
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,239
不肯自带午餐
He won't pack his own lunch.

103
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,710
还不肯让人在他家沙发上过夜
Won't let you spend the night on his couch.

104
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,915
你觉得派对气球怎么弄?
Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?

105
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,550
铝箔气球可以有
Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.

106
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,151
乳胶气球不行
Latex balloons, no.

107
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:18,287
要是水球 那我就瞄准你的车
Water balloons, I will jump off the roof

108
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,489
从楼顶跳下去
and aim for your car.

109
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,592
知道了 那音乐呢?
All right, what about music?

110
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:24,993
我喜欢游行乐队
I enjoy marching bands

111
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,730
还有西藏的喉音唱法
and Tibetan throat singing.

112
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,164
音乐免了
No music it is.

113
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:31,767
你喜欢什么蛋糕?
What kind of cake do you like?

114
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,703
我最爱草莓霜的巧克力蛋糕
Well, my favorite is chocolate with strawberry frosting,

115
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,572
三层 如果上面有字的话
three layers, and if there's

116
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,340
不可以全部大写
writing on it, make sure it's not all caps.

117
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:41,844
我可不想甜点冲我嚷嚷
I don't need my dessert yelling at me.

118
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,915
Adam在电话里怎么样?
Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?

119
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,217
人还不错
Uh, nice guy.

120
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,918
但听蝙蝠侠说"别按门铃
But it was a little weird to hear Batman say,

121
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,856
不然我的狗宝宝们会发疯"有点奇怪
"Don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."

122
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,859
你知道吗? 他是我最爱的蝙蝠侠
You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman?

123
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,160
那个
Well,

124
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:00,496
除了迈克尔·基顿和克里斯蒂安·贝尔
after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale

125
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,731
还有乐高大电影里的蝙蝠侠
and Batman from The Lego Movie.

126
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,300
你别跟他说这个
Don't say that to him.

127
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:07,669
怎么了? 他赢了乔治·克鲁尼
What? He beat out George Clooney.

128
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,670
这很厉害啊
And that's something.

129
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:11,039
人家可心水克鲁尼呢
Like, I love me some Clooney.

130
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,442
你别再说这句话了
Don't say that to anyone.

131
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,046
谢谢你来帮忙 Stuart
Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.

132
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,748
哦... 我能被邀请
Oh, I... I was just

133
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,416
就很开心了
glad to be invited.

134
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:24,453
说实话 我有时候觉得自己不属于这个团体
To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm part of the group.

135
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:25,621
行了 亲 我们赶时间呢
Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.

136
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:28,123
你能边涂糖霜边自嘲么?
Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?

137
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,960
嗨 希望我没来得太早
Hello, I hope I'm not too early.

138
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:32,895
没没 快进
No, no, no. Come on in.

139
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,464
我们容光焕发的准妈妈怎么样啊?
And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?

140
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,932
挺好的
Doing great.

141
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,967
你怀孕了?
Y-You're pregnant?

142
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:39,935
嗯
Yeah.

143
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,937
听起来像是
Sounds like something

144
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,907
团体成员该知道的事儿啊
a member of the group might know.

145
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,175
生日派对先
Yeah, birthday party first.

146
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:48,243
自怨派对后
Pity party later.

147
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,047
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

148
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:53,749
你怎么能把迈克尔·基顿
How can you put Michael Keaton

149
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,084
排在克里斯蒂安·贝尔前面呢?
in front of Christian Bale?

150
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,253
拜托哦
Oh, please.

151
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:03,725
就连我的狗宝都知道贝尔被过誉了
Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.

152
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,794
谢谢你!
Thank you!

153
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,696
所以我才说基顿是第一
That's why I say Keaton's number one.

154
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,364
他给角色注入了幽默感
He brought a sense of humor to the role.

155
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,466
哦 你们要是考虑幽默感的话
Oh, if you're gonna factor in a sense of humor,

156
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:14,636
那我就该排第一了
then I should be at the top of the list.

157
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,472
排名应该是我
It should be me,

158
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:18,607
基顿 基尔默
Keaton, Kilmer,

159
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,242
乐高 贝尔
Lego, Bale,

160
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:22,444
还有小白脸克鲁尼
and that pretty boy Clooney.

161
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:26,181
真的吗?
Really?

162
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,749
你在贝尔前面?
You're ahead of Bale?

163
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:29,718
那个把"我是蝙蝠侠"
The man who personified the words,

164
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,754
说成招牌的男人
"I'm Batman."

165
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,356
我从来不用说自己是蝙蝠侠
I never had to say I'm Batman.

166
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,557
我出现
I showed up.

167
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,026
大家就知道我是蝙蝠侠
People knew I was Batman.

168
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,697
不论去哪... 电视节目
Everywhere I went... on the TV show,

169
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,898
商场开业...
mall openings...

170
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,068
朱丽叶·纽玛的别墅
Julie Newmar's bungalow.

171
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,173
我信了... 你比贝尔强
I'm sold... you're ahead of Bale.

172
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,877
还有一个我应该排名靠前的原因
There's another reason I should be higher on the list.

173
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,311
其他这些家伙
All those other guys

174
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:59,448
演出服里都有垫东西假扮肌肉
had muscles built into their costumes.

175
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,717
我的演出服里
All I had in my Batsuit

176
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:05,687
可是100%如假包换的优质肌肉男West
was 100%, grade-A West.

177
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,893
{\an8} ben affleck 新的蝙蝠侠扮演者

178
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,893
反正大家统一意见都不看好Affleck就好了?
Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?

179
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:13,028
- 好的  - 当然了
- Sure.  - Yeah, of course.

180
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,365
Affleck是谁?
What's an Affleck?

181
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:22,004
真的有必要让我离开住的地方吗?
Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?

182
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,672
他们只是想让你第一眼
Well, I think they just want you to see it

183
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:25,274
看见的时候就已经是都装扮好了的
for the first time all decorated.

184
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,944
那该由谁来告诉他们做法完全不对呢?
But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?

185
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:32,180
我肯定他们会要你讲点儿什么的
Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech,

186
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:34,917
那时你就能好好把握机会了
and that's when you just tear 'em a new one.

187
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,819
不得不说...
Have to say, you...

188
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,755
你穿这套衣服真帅
you do look good in that suit.

189
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:41,189
谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

190
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:43,325
或许待会儿我可以...
Maybe later I'll, uh...

191
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:47,062
{\an8}出生时穿的(裸体)

192
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:47,062
看你穿生日套装
get to see you in your birthday suit.

193
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,000
可这就是我的生日套装啊
But this is my birthday suit.

194
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:56,204
你脑子抽了?
Are you having a stroke?

195
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,840
那种事情
Because that's the kind of thing

196
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:00,275
只会毁掉生日派对的气氛
that just ruins a birthday party.

197
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:05,247
老妈 我很意外你大老远地
So, Mother, I'm surprised you came all this way

198
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,348
跑来参加Sheldon的生日派对
for Sheldon's birthday.

199
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,482
我愿意来
Oh, I was happy to.

200
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,418
他参加了我的60大寿
He did come to my 60th.

201
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,288
你还办了60大寿呢?
Oh. You had a party for your 60th?

202
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,590
没怎么大操大办
Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.

203
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:17,559
就几个经常来往的朋友
Just a few close friends.

204
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,929
还有你姐姐和哥哥
And your sister and brother.

205
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,701
公平点讲 我们在拉斯维加斯结婚时
You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas

206
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:26,735
也没有邀请她
and didn't invite her.

207
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:29,638
我还没为你贴心的这么做谢过你呢 宝贝
And I never did thank you for that, dear.

208
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:34,042
噢
Oh.

209
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:37,045
Penny说大家伙都来了 你准备好了吗?
Penny says everyone's there. Are you ready?

210
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,648
准备好了
I am.

211
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,257
- 等等  - 你还好吗?
- Oh. Wait.  - Are you all right?

212
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,094
我只是...有点发晕
No, I just... I got a little light-headed.

213
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,528
你要歇会儿吗?
Oh, d-do you need a minute?

214
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,664
不用了
No.

215
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,000
既然我能走过
No, if I can walk past that pet shop

216
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,436
窗口有鹦鹉的宠物店 我想这个我也能挺过去
with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.

217
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,844
生日快乐!

218
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,980

抱歉
Excuse me.

230
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:57,359
我还是有报酬的 对吧?
I still get paid, don't I?

231
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:09,326
我最好进去跟他谈谈
Okay, I'd better go in there and talk to him.

232
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,295
你不觉得该由我进去和他谈吗?
Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?

233
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:14,098
没别的意思 可我认识他很长时间了
No offense, but I've known the guy a really long time.

234
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,966
我也 你知道
Well, I've, you know,

235
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:18,702
见过他赤条条的样子
seen him without pants on.

236
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:22,639
还是没别的意思 我也见过
Again, no offense, but so have I.

237
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,908
他见过我赤条条的样子
Well, he's seen me without pants on.

238
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,876
还是这么说...
Again, no...

239
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:28,078
够了 太恶心了
Okay, this is ridiculous.

240
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,082
Sheldon 还好吗?
Sheldon?

241
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,083
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

242
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:37,087
你咋知道我没在上厕所?
How do you know I'm not using the facilities?

243
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,857
因为即使我无数次的取消订阅
Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week,

244
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:41,425
可你还是每周都发邮件
even though I've clicked unsubscribe,

245
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,960
告诉我你如厕时间表
like, a thousand times.

246
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,868
所以...
So...

247
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,503
到底怎么了?
what's going on?

248
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:53,904
我也不明白
I don't know.

249
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,639
我看了看房子
I-I looked around the room,

250
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,741
看到了大伙的笑脸还有礼物
and I saw all the faces and the presents,

251
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:00,110
就觉得...太过了
and it... it was just too much.

252
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,646
我明了了
I get that.

253
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,284
你愿意只叫几个人进来吗?
Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here?

254
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:09,186
Wil Wheaton站澡缸里
You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,

255
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,522
蝙蝠侠坐马桶上
Batman on the toilet.

256
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,724
就像有史以来最古怪的动漫展
It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

257
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,829
我知道你们花了很多心思办这个
I know that you worked hard to put this together.

258
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,330
抱歉我搞糟了
I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

259
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,598
别啊 你没有搞糟
Oh, pl... You're not ruining it.

260
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,634
某一刻 Raj 还想让大家
Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone

261
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,935
跳太空舞步
to do the Electric Slide.

262
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,637
那才会毁了派对
Now, that will ruin it.

263
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,808
我不觉得我现在可以去外面
I don't think I can go back out there.

264
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,377
可以啊
That's fine.

265
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,191
我讨厌你的妹妹和她的朋友们
You know, I hate that your sister and her friends

266
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,493
过去经常折磨你
used to torture you.

267
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,228
但我更讨厌
But what I hate even more

268
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,765
如果当时我在 我也会和她们一起折磨你
is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.

269
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:59,903
你这段"鼓舞人心"的话 也是在折磨我
Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.

270
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,339
我的意思是
My point is,

271
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,308
曾几何时 我不可能会和
there was a time I never would've been friends

272
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,510
你这样的人成为朋友 但是现在...
with someone like you, and now...

273
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,245
你是我最喜欢的人
you are one of my favorite people.

274
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,581
所以 如果你想
So, if what you need is

275
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,250
在厕所度过你的生日
to spend your birthday in a bathroom,

276
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,386
我很高兴可以陪你一起
I'm happy to do it with you.

277
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,290
那大家会觉得我很奇怪的
Well, everyone will think I'm weird.

278
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,500
亲 你就是很奇怪
Sweetie, you are weird.

279
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,703
大家都知道你奇怪
Everyone knows you're weird,

280
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:33,971
但他们还是来了
but they're all still here

281
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,540
因为他们是如此的关心你
because they care about you so much.

282
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:38,842
喂
Hello.

283
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:40,277
有人需要整理一下发型
Some of us need to check our hair

284
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,247
因为他可能有机会泡到Leonard的妈妈
because we might have a shot with Leonard's mother.

285
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,485
- Leonard  - 你好
- Leonard.  - Hey.

286
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,753
好久不见
It's been a while.

287
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:50,888
Leslie.
Leslie

288
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,523
我都不记得我们上次讲话时什么时候了
I can't remember the last time we talked.

289
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,258
好多事情变了
So much has changed.

290
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,228
是吗?
Has it?

291
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:01,632
是啊 Penny和我结婚了
Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.

292
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,066
哇哦 恭喜啊
Wow, congratulations.

293
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,334
你要知道 实际上
You know, actually,

294
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,103
我以为你会永远和Sheldon住在一起
I thought you'd be living with Sheldon forever.

295
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:08,038
是啊 呃...
Yeah, well...

296
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,074
下回聊
Don't be a stranger.

297
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,111
好的 大家伙儿
Okay, everybody,

298
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,345
Sheldon要出来了
Sheldon is gonna come back out,

299
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,680
但我觉得他还是有点尴尬
but I think he's a little embarrassed,

300
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,316
所以我们表现的格外友好一点 好吗?
so let's all be extra nice, okay?

301
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,751
你干嘛看着我?
What are you looking at me for?

302
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,185
我是个圣人
I'm a saint.

303
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,187
但在床上的时候是个罪人
But a sinner in the sack.

304
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:29,493
大家好
Hello, everyone.

305
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:30,594
我...
I-I...

306
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,462
我对我刚才的行为表示抱歉
I'd like to apologize for my behavior.

307
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:35,198
希望没有扫大家的兴
I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party.

308
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,167
大家玩得高兴
So, just, please, enjoy yourselves.

309
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,335
那就好
That's good.

310
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:44,207
这失控的好快
Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.

311
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,276
如果可以
If I may,

312
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,579
我提议举杯
I-I'd like to propose a toast.

00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,981
谢谢大家今晚的到来
Um, thank you all for coming tonight.

314
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,049
我知道
I know it's customary

315
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,985
寿星收礼物是传统
for the birthday boy to receive presents,

316
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,220
但我觉得当他出生时
but I feel like I got the greatest gift

317
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,589
我收到了最好的礼物
the day he was born.

318
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,623
哇哦
Aw.

319
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,625
- 听听  - 干杯
- Hear, hear.  - Cheers.

Amy, that was lovely.

这好有趣
this is fun.

322
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:07,598
再来
Let's do more.

323
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,900
其他人说些关于我的好话
Someone else say something wonderful about me.

324
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:12,202
Sheldon 我不觉得大家...
Sheldon, I don't think everyone...

325
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,304
Wolowitz 好极了 大家听Wolowitz说
Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

326
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,374
好吧 呃
Okay, then, uh,

327
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,142
Sheldon啊
Sheldon,

328
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,777
我们认识彼此有很长时间了

和你一起工作 做你的朋友
And it is a pleasure to work with you

330
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:25,816
都是很愉快的
and call you my friend.

331
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,551
有点普通 继续想 待会儿轮回来
Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back.

332
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,052
Wil Wheaton 你说
Wil Wheaton, go.

333
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:33,890
Sheldon 我知道我们的关系有起伏
Sheldon, I know that we've had our ups and downs,

334
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,959
但我可以很真诚地说
but I can honestly say

335
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,461
我的生命因为有你
that my life is so much more interesting

336
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:38,662
而变得更精彩
because you are in it.

337
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:42,165
或许我们的相遇是因为你是星际迷航的粉丝
We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek.

338
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,635
但我现在已经成为Sheldon Cooper的粉丝

生日快乐

342
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:48,739
干杯
Cheers.

343
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:51,008
你应该这样说 Wolowitz
That's how you do it, Wolowitz.

344
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,043
现在我们知道
Now you see

345
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,511
为什么他出名而你没有
why he's famous and you're not.

346
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:58,448
嘿 Sheldon
Sheldon,

347
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,917
我知道你在未来一定会变得更好

349
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,856
生日快乐 亲爱的
Happy birthday, dear.

350
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,758
干杯
Cheers.

351
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,292
谁给动物管理局打个电话吧
Someone call Animal Control.

352
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:11,862
有头美洲豹出来野了
There's a cougar on the loose.

353
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,598
Barry 别闹了
Barry, stop.

354
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,233
讲真 Barry 你够了
Seriously, Barry, stop.

355
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:21,271
甘地曾经说过
And it was Gandhi who said,

356
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,640
"珍惜生命
"Live as if you were to

357
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,809

"热爱学习

而Sheldon Cooper曾经说过 "你快点说
And it was Sheldon Cooper who said "Let's speed this up.

361
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,717
还有好多人等着说话呢"
A lot of people want to talk"

362
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,620
以前 我大概会说点不好听的
Uh, in the past, I would've said something obnoxious,

363
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:38,889
比如说 "生日快乐啊 蠢货"
like, "Happy birthday, dumbass".

364
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,991
不过今年我准备换换样
But I'm not gonna do it.

365
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:42,659
咱们都成熟了不少
You and I have both grown a lot,

366
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:45,262

如果你们今天见到我很开心的话

374
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,646
我还可以出席漫展

你说的太好了
That was perfect.

381
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:18,929
神马? 你在逗我笑?
What? You gotta be kidding me?

382
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,364
Sheldon 我们认识的时间太长了
Sheldon, we've been together so long,

383
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,000
我都想不出来 我生活中没有你是什么样子的了
it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life.

384
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,502
真的 我努力想过
And believe me, I try.

你帮我成为了更好的科学家

00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,342
你也会让我抓狂
You make me crazy.

388
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:33,944
我绝不仅仅把你当做室友
You're more than just my roommate,

389
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:35,679
我已经把你当做亲兄弟了
you're my brother.

Stuart didn't get to speak.

396
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,892
哦 好吧 呃...
Oh, oh, okay. Um...

那个 Sheldon
Uh, Sheldon,

398
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,829
我一直都觉得 从来没人注意我
I've spent most of my life feeling invisible,

399
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:54,898
不过和你们在一起...
but having you and everyone...

400
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,867
嘿 你们快来看
Hey, everybody, listen up.

404
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,709

呃 霍金教授
Uh, Professor Hawking,

414
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,295
你能不能等一下

415
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,631
等我们把蜡烛点好 然后就可以一起唱了
we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.

416
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,901
打断了我这动人的歌喉 不跟你计较了
I was crushing it, but all right.

417
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,570
趁他们准备蛋糕
Okay, while they get the cake,

418
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:35,138
我想说 Sheldon 
Sheldon, I just want to say,

419
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,907
不来个大大的熊抱 
I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight

420
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:38,008
你是过不去今晚的
without a hug.

421
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:40,877
你知道我以前有多痛恨拥抱
You know, I used to hate these hugs.

422
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,383
现在 只是觉得很烦人而已了
Now they're just extremely irritating.

423
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,596
你准备好了我们就开始吧 霍金教授
Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.

424
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,098
