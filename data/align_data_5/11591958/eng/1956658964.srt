required all new cars

4
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:18,235
The first state to do this
was California,

5
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,672

to say things like...

6
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:23,371

00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,557
his wife is all skinny
and loves him way more.

179
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,560
So you want a wife who loves you
because you have money?

180
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,257
A skinny wife.

181
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,478
I have something for you.

182
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,915
You said you wanted a cross,

183
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,788
and this is the one I used to
wear when I was your age.

184
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,181
It's so pretty.

185
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:09,010
I'm glad you like it.

186
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:13,275
It's a nice reminder
that wherever you are,

187
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,885
God is always with you.

188
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,673
And it means a lot to me
that you want to wear it.

189
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:23,459
<i>Thanks, Mom.
I'm gonna pray right now.</i>

190
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,374
God, it's Missy again.

191
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,700
If you can hear me better, it's
'cause I'm wearing a cross now.

192
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,987
Please let me get
a lot of hits on Saturday.

193
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,686
And if their star pitcher
breaks his arm or gets run over

194
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,602
by a truck, I'd totally
be okay with that.

195
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,604
Amen.

196
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,823
Amen.

197
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,695
Now we have to sift
the powder again

198
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,827
because the platinum particles
are extremely small,

199
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,003
sometimes no more than
just a few atoms.

200
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,093
If I was as smart as you,
I'd play the stock market.

201
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,660
Or go on Price Is Right.

202
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,620
I'd rather spend my time
focusing on important things,

203
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,013
like figuring out how
the universe works.

204
00:08:56,057 --> 00:09:00,583
So, say you figure out how
the universe works. Then what?

205
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,977
I'm not sure,
but in the meantime,

206
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,413
I agree with Richard Feynman.

207
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,677
I simply enjoy the pleasure
of finding things out.

208
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,244
I agree with the Beastie Boys.

209
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,594
You got to fight
for your right to party.

210
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,510
Well, it's good to have
a personal philosophy.

211
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,469
GEORGE JR.:
<i>What's next? We create a chemical flux</i>

212
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,254
by combining borax,
sodium carbonate,

213
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,690
lead oxide and flour.

214
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,692
Did you know Sheldon and Georgie

215
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,056
are working
on something together?

216
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,348
That's nice. And guess what...

217
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,742
Missy asked me
if she could wear a cross.

218
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,614
She's in her bedroom
saying prayers right now.

219
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,051
Hmm. I don't like it.

220
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,706
<i>What are you talking about?
Our kids are behaving.</i>

221
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,274
<i>Exactly.
Something bad's gonna happen.</i>

222
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,928
Why can't you just be thankful?

223
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,495
Because that's when life kicks
you right in the plums, Mary.

224
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,933
Dad, where's your power drill?

225
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,588
<i>Why? Our oven doesn't reach
2,000 degrees,</i>

226
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,372
so we're going to make
a homemade kiln

227
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,765
out of a garbage can.

228
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,288
And there go the plums.

229
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,812
Are you two trying
to burn down the house?

230
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,032
No, we're trying to make
platinum out of gravel.

231
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,295
You're not building
a 2,000-degree oven.

232
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:03,385
<i>Fine. Just so you know,
I was gonna cut you in.</i>

233
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,823
<i>Really? You'll fight
for your right to party</i>

234
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,235
but not for your right
to make a device

235
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,802
that'll exceed
the melting point of lead?

236
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,175
GEORGE JR.: Shut up.

237
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,221
Ooh, "Why can't you
be thankful?"

238
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,705
What's your problem?

239
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,750
Mom and Dad won't
let me build a kiln,

240
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:23,710
so Georgie and I can't
finish our experiment.

241
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,842
Before you tell me,
I don't care what a kiln is.

242
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,323
Okay, but you'll never know
it's a high-temperature oven.

243
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,108
If you're unhappy,
just ask God for help.

244
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,414
I don't believe in God.

245
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,372
(SHUSHES) He can hear you.

246
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,679
He knows if you've
been bad or good.

247
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,334
Like Santa,
but he can send you to hell.

248
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,790
I'm not going to ask
some magical being

249
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,206
to solve my problems.

250
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,382
I asked him to help me
with my batting, and he did.

251
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:50,911
There's a pottery kiln
in art class. We can use that.

252
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,303
(DOOR OPENS)

253
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,741
Georgie, I figured it out!

254
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:58,919
Good job, but that does not
count as one of my wishes.

255
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,272
Why are we being sneaky?

256
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:06,187
I thought you said
we have permission.

257
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,886
<i>We do. I just don't want anybody
knowing about our platinum.</i>

258
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,497
<i>Smart. Last week, I bragged
about having a Nutter Butter,</i>

259
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,065
and some rat stole it
right out of my lunch bag.

260
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,807
Well, it sure wasn't me.

261
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,940
And then I hit it over
the right fielder's head.

262
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,811
Sounds like you had
a good practice.

263
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,775
<i>I did. Coach said
he's gonna have me hit cleanup.</i>

264
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:24,988
BILLY: Missy,

265
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,990
will you rub your cross
on my bat?

266
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,035
No.

267
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,558
Have you been doing that?

268
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,038
On mine. It's working great.

269
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,343
Please?

270
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,128
I'll give you a dollar.

271
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,043
Fine.

272
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,871
What do you think you're doing?

273
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,742
Sharing God's love
and making some cash.

274
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,222
Absolutely not.

275
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,745
How about I give you the dollar?

276
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,879
God's love has nothing
to do with money.

277
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,508
What about the collection plate
at church?

278
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,491
That is different.

279
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,884
That's where I found
this dollar.

280
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,233
Okay. (SIGHS)

281
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,278
Bye.

282
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,865
So now we just wait
for the concrete dust

283
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,891
to dissolve
and the lead to melt?

284
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,544
That's exactly right.

285
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,155
I know. I listen.

286
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,896
And you understand it? I work in sales.

287
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,898
I don't need to know
what I'm talking about

288
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,377
to make it sound good.

289
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,051
Don't you think it would
make you better at your job

290
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,077
if you understood the products
you were selling?

291
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,470
<i>No. People don't
want to hear facts. I do.</i>

292
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,212
Normal people don't
want to hear facts.

293
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,648
I'm normal.

294
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:17,737
Are you?

295
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,782
No, I'm special.

296
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,568
<i>Is it supposed to be doing that?
Something's wrong.</i>

297
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,111
Maybe we didn't sift out
all the rubber.

298
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,484
I think it's burning.Okay.

299
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,269
Okay, calm down. I'll handle it.

300
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:31,838
I'm having difficulty
remaining calm.

301
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,755
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

302
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,409
(ALARM RINGING)

303
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,282
I'm feeling more calm now.

304
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,897
What were you thinking? Well...

305
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,377
I don't want to hear excuses.

306
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,640
You could've burned
the school down.

307
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:52,922
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

308
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,687
I thought you didn't want
to hear my excuses.

309
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,472
Oh, no, we didn't break
into the classroom.

310
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,430
Georgie had permission
from the teacher.

311
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,625
That is not important right now.

312
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,782
So you think a teacher
said it was okay

313
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,653
for a ten-year-old and an idiot

314
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,177
to use a 2,000-degree oven
unsupervised?

315
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,094
You fibber.

316
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:14,706
(GASPS)
You also stole my Nutter Butter.

317
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,409
Are you mad at me?

318
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,498
No. You sure?

319
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,109
'Cause that's how you look when
Dad had that breakfast beer.

320
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:33,029
To be honest, I'm a little
concerned that I have given you

321
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,815
the wrong impression
about how prayer works.

322
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,730
<i>I get it. I ask God for stuff,
he gives it to me.</i>

323
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:39,731
It's not rocket science.

324
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,734
Missy, God does not
grant wishes.

325
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,562
So he gave me good luck?

326
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,869
(SIGHS) It's not luck.

327
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:50,873
Luck is chance,
and God has a plan.

328
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,833
Right, and his plan is to give
me what I want when I pray.

329
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,269
That's why he's so cool.

330
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:58,272
No. I... I mean, he is cool,

331
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:01,101
but sometimes
that might not be his plan.

332
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,450
Then what's the point of praying

333
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,017
if he's just gonna do
what he wants?

334
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,628
You don't pray to God
to get things.

335
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,587
You pray to build
a relationship with him.

336
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,287
<i>This is too complicated.
I'm just gonna keep</i>

337
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,419
rubbing this thing on my bat
and kicking butt.

338
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,900
Okay, that is it. Take it off.

339
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,250
<i>No, I need it.
The game's Saturday.</i>

340
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,818
There are more important things
than baseball.

341
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,428
Now, hand it over.

342
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,300
God, cover your ears.

343
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,867
Damn it.

344
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,433
Missy Cooper!

345
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,914
<i>You are not ready for that.
You give that back.</i>

346
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,743
Oh, you... Get!

347
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:42,011
MARY: Lord,
I really need you right now.

348
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:46,015
I have tried so hard to lead
my family to your light,

349
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,889
but so far, Sheldon doesn't believe in you,

350
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,282
Missy thinks
you're a magic trick,

351
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,762
and you're not a teenage girl,

352
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,634
so Georgie doesn't think
about you at all.

353
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,247
I never thought I'd take a
cross away from my own child,

354
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,553
but what choice did I have?

355
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:05,295
She was rubbing it
on sporting equipment.

356
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,384
I didn't think there was
a wrong way to pray,

357
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,344
but leave it
to that girl to find one.

358
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:14,957
Please give me the strength to
keep guiding my family to you.

359
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:18,265
I can't do it on my own. Amen.

360
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,139
So, how was everybody's day?

361
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,272
(THROAT CLEARING)

362
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,363
That good, huh?

363
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:30,886
How about we just say grace?

364
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,541
You're gonna ask him to
bless the food? Interesting.

365
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,977
That is enough.

366
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,848
Oh, come on.

367
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,415
How can I appreciate
all this tension

368
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,113
if I don't know what it's about?

369
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,985
Mom took my cross away, and
I have a game on Saturday.

370
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,770
<i>Why would you do that?
She's out of the slump.</i>

371
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,511
She was being sacrilegious.

372
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,904
Mary, this is sports.

373
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,751
When something's working,
you do not mess with it.

374
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:54,823
<i>I am not changing my mind.
God is not a good-luck charm.</i>

375
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,019
Well, how about all the players
that kiss their crosses

376
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,740
before they go
in the batter's box?

377
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,351
They can take it up
with their mommies.

378
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,962
So she's finally hitting good,

379
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,809
and you're gonna let her go
to that game all up in her head?

380
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,791
Her relationship with God
is more important

381
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,011
than getting some hits
in a baseball game.

382
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,684
<i>This is perfect.
They're mad at each other.</i>

383
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,058
Takes the heat off us.

384
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,539
<i>Thank you. I had no idea
what was going on.</i>

385
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,888
Mary, give her the cross back.

386
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:20,501
When she is ready
for it, I will.

387
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,677
I have a bunch of crosses
in my jewelry box.

388
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,766
You can take any one you want.

389
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:28,117
<i>I don't want another cross.
I want my lucky cross.</i>

390
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,728
And that is exactly why
she is not ready.

391
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,774
Let's say grace.

392
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,905
(MARY SIGHS)

393
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,866
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive,

394
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,868
and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

395
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,001
ALL: Amen.

396
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,745
I'm glad we're no
longer in trouble

397
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,704
for almost burning
the school down.

398
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,835
MEEMAW: Ooh.

399
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,099
Let's talk about that.

400
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,562
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)SHELDON: Georgie.

401
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,284
Yeah?

402
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,287
Are you still interested
in getting rich quick?

403
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,464
No, I want to do it slow
like a chump.

404
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,248
Oh. Never mind.

405
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,554
Tell me, Sheldon.

406
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,296
It occurred to me that
a good way to generate

407
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,906
a positive cash flow
would be to curate

408
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,691
popular songs and make them
available in a digital form.

409
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,085
Possibly on a small device
that could also be used

410
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,695
as a phone or even a camera.

411
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,655
Right. A phone, camera,
music machine.

412
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,091
Get out of here.

413
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,097
Psst. Hey, Missy.

414
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,446
Come here.

415
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,318
What? I'm up next.

416
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,146
I know. Here.

417
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,760
Don't tell your mother.

418
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,721
I think I want
to do this on my own. You sure?

419
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:54,073
Just in case Mom's right,
I don't want to make God mad.

420
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,118
UMPIRE:
Strike three. You're out.

421
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,685
All right. Go get 'em.

422
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,264
Strike one! Dad!

423
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,482
GEORGE SR.: Coming!
