根据《空气清洁法案》规定
The Clean Air Act required all new cars

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,920
所有车辆均需安装催化转化器
to be equipped with catalytic converters

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,700
来减轻空气污染

10
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,300
加利佛尼亚是第一个执行该规定的州

{\an8}投票箱

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,680
这引发了德克萨斯州人的一系列不满
which led Texans to say things like...

13
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,330
{\an8}催化转化器在德州投入使用

14
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:23,371
-我恨透了加州  -以及
- I hate California. - And...

15
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,980
那鬼地方啥时候能沉没啊
When will that place fall in the ocean?

16
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,320
虽然不是人人都满意这个结果
While not everyone was happy about it,

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,700
六年后  有一个德州人
six years later, one particular texan

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,180
却从中发现了商机
saw an opportunity to get rich quick.

买它只花了我一美元
Only cost me a dollar.

26
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,600
有没有写着"如何用一条垃圾简报
Is one of the tips "Make a crappy newsletter

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,820
让傻子付一美元"
and charge idiots a dollar for it"?

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,660
没有  但这主意听起来也不错
No, but not a bad idea.

29
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,740
你听这条
Listen to this:

30
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,240
"养蜜蜂并卖蜂蜜赚钱"
"Raise bees and sell the honey for profit."

31
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,000
你养吧  我搬去和外婆住
Do it, and I'm living with meemaw.

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,400
"卖血和一些不必要的器官"
"Sell blood or non-vital organs."

33
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,040
把你的脑子卖给我  反正你也没用
Mm, give 'em your brain. You're not using it.

34
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,380
这好像是我第一次听到你笑
I think that's the only time I've ever heard you laugh.

35
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,700
这是你第一次讲了好笑的笑话
That's the only time you've ever been funny.

36
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,880
还有还有  可以从路边砾石中
Oh, platinum can be extracted

37
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,020
提炼铂金
from ordinary roadside gravel.

38
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
可以才怪
No, it can't.

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,160
确实可以
Actually, it can.

40
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
汽车的催化转化器里就含有铂金
Catalytic converters contain platinum.

41
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,620
那些铂金微粒
Microparticles of that platinum

42
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,760
会随着尾气一起排出
are expelled in the exhaust

43
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,780
吸附在砾石上
and are mixed in with the gravel.

44
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,240
你看  我就说这玩意儿是个金矿吧
See? This thing's a gold mine.

45
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,340
其实叫"铂金矿"更准确一些
It would be more apt to call it a platinum mine.

46
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,480
刚才你说笑话我可是笑了
I laughed at your joke.

47

喂  裁判  你秃了
Hey ump, you're bald.

63

83

我不配吃冰雪皇后
I don't deserve dairy queen.

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,380
不是你的错  宝贝
It's not your fault, honey.

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
那个投球手几乎是个成年人了

86
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,640
我感觉我昨晚上在酒吧看见他了
I think I saw him at the bar last night.

87
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,300
你只是经历了一个小低谷
Y-you're just going through a little slump.

大家都会有这样的经历
Happens to everyone.

行吧  那我要怎么走出低谷呢
Well, how do I get out of it?

90
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,140
我在赌桌上
When I've been at the craps table...

91
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,660
乔治  你来给点建议
George, you give advice.

92
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,660
机智啊  一辈子都在低谷里的男人
Oh, smart. Man's been in a slump his whole life.

93
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,780
你可以放空大脑
You just got to get out of your head.

94
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
你  你想得太多了
You... you're thinking too much.

95
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,800
我保证  想太多永远不会成为我的问题
I promise thinking too much has never been my problem.

96
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,880
我感觉低落的时候  你知道会做什么吗
When I'm feeling down, do you know what I do?

97
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
祈祷
Pray.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,980
真的管用
It works.

99
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,280
实际上  我今晚要为你祈祷
In fact, I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,580
每个人都会在晚上向上帝祈祷
Everybody prays to god at night.

101
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,120
现在做吧  现在他有空
Do it now while he's got some free time.

102
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,680
你干嘛呢
Hey what you doing?

103
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,120
在玩一个符合史实的游戏  《俄勒冈之旅》
Playing a historically accurate game called the Oregon trail.

104
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,400
听着就没劲
That sounds boring.

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
才不是呢  我的马车坏了一个车轴
Hardly. My wagon broke an axle

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
我妻子死于痢疾
and my wife died of dysentery.

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,580
那你能暂停一会吗
Well, can you pause it for a sec?

108
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,640
现在急着去俄勒冈确实有点没人性
It does seems rude to push on to Oregon

109
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,040
毕竟我女儿梅布尔在哀悼死去的母亲呢
while my daughter Mabel is mourning the loss of her mother.

110
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,080
什么事
What can I do for you?

111
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,400
你记不记得我们讨论过砾石里的铂
Remember when we were talking about platinum in gravel?

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
你知道怎么提取出来吗
Do you know how to get it out?

113
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,300
这不复杂
It's not a complicated principle.

114
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,340
我用我的质子教授化学套装应该就能完成
I could probably do it with my professor proton chemistry set.

115
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,180
那太好了
Great.

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,620
还得有一个能达到两千度的烤箱
And an oven that reaches 2,000 degrees.

117
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
咱家烤箱可以吗
Does our oven do that?

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,950
不行  但我在书上看过
No, but I read you can build one

119
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,060
可以用垃圾箱和落叶鼓风机做一个
out of a garbage can and a leaf blower.

120
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,580
那好啊  咱们搞点铂金矿吧
Cool. Let's mine some platinum.

121
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,960
不了谢谢  我才不在乎挣钱呢
No, thank you. I don't care about money.

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,440
但是你在乎科学  对吗
But you care about science, right?

123
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,090
当然
Of course.

124
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,420
所以我现在给你个做实验的机会
So I offer you the chance to do an experiment

125
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,780
你却宁愿玩游戏
and you'd rather play a video game?

126
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
质子教授得怎么想啊
What would professor proton think?

127
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,200
{\an8}质子教授  多学科实验室工具套装

128
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,840
他会失望的
He'd be disappointed.

129
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,620
所以怎么样
So what do you say?

130
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,780
咱们去收集砾石吧
I say we collect gravel.

131
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,300
这就对了
There you go.

132
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,660
另外  不用担心
In case you're worried,

133
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,180
梅布尔和我后来到了俄勒冈
Mabel and I did finally make it to Oregon,

134
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,160
在那  我定居而且再婚了  活到了41岁的高龄
where I remarried and lived to the ripe old age of 41.

135
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,920
好了库伯  记住我告诉过你的
All right, Cooper, remember what I told you, okay?

136
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,260
屈膝  手肘向外
Knees bent, elbows out,

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,580
盯紧了球
eye on the ball.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
等一下
Hang on.

139
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,260
上帝你好  我是密西·库伯
Hi, God. It's Missy Cooper.

140
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,780
我知道我妈那天跟你说起我了
I know my mom talked to you about me the other day,

141
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,700
她可是你的头号粉丝
and she's, like, your biggest fan.

142
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,140
这是怎么了啊
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,840
你是睡着了还是咋地啊
What, did you fall asleep?

144
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,500
不好意思啊  我刚在祈祷
Sorry, I was praying.

145
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,620
哦这样啊  抱歉
Oh, my apologies.

146
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,640
总之  我真的需要你帮我打到这一球
Anyway, I could really use your help getting a hit.

147
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,680
阿门
Amen.

148
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,260
-好了  -可以开始了吗
- Okay. - Are we good?

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,980
我也不知道  试试吧
I don't know. We'll find out.

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,260
好的  记住
Okay, remember,

151
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,800
抬高手肘
elbows up,

152
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,320
弯曲膝盖
knees bent.

153
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,060
我要扔了  库珀
I'm coming at you, Cooper.

154
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,900
就是这样  完美
Way to go. Perfect.

155
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,640
感谢上帝
Thank you, god.

156
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,260
或者说"感谢教练"
How about, "Thank you, coach"?

157
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,100
-谢谢教练  -晚了
- Thank you, coach. - Too late.

158
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,940
这儿应该不错
This should be a good spot.

159
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,760
车来车往  大量废气排出
It's a high-traffic area, which means plenty of exhaust,

160
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,560
也就有大量的铂
and therefore plenty of platinum.

161
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,180
太好了  那咱们开始挖吧
Great. Let's get shoveling.

162
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,620
你不打算帮忙吗
You ain't gonna help?

163
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,040
不要
No.

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
练习怎么样
How was practice?

165
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,600
很好  我把球打得最远
Great. I hit the ball further than anyone.

166
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,480
听起来祈祷还是有作用的嘛
Sounds like a little prayer helped after all.

167
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,400
-我猜也是  -你看起来有点惊讶啊
- I guess it did. - You seem surprised.

168
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,440
上帝什么都知道
Well, God knows everything,

169
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,200
而我又有些邪恶的想法
and I have some pretty evil thoughts.

170
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,300
密西
Oh, missy.

171
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,220
万一我开始戴十字架
Ooh, what if I start wearing a cross

172
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,880
而上帝知道我是真邪恶呢
so god knows I mean business?

173
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,100
你可以清理一下思绪
You could also clean up your thinking.

174
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,580
不了吧
Nah.

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,500
怎么这么慢
What's taking so long?

176
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,580
要是你帮忙了的话  会更快
It'd be faster if you helped.

177
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,020
我们都知道那是不可能的
Well, we know that's not happening.

178
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,180
我知道您忙于处理许多苦难大事
I know you got your hands full with all that sad stuff,

179
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,320
疾病  战争  饥荒  贫穷之类的
like disease and war and hunger and poverty,

180
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,920
所以再次谢谢您抽空让我在训练中击中了球
so thanks again for helping me get some hits at practice.

181
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,880
阿门
Amen.

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,540
别忘了向他祈求家人平安健康
Don't forget to ask him to keep our family safe and healthy.

183
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,080
我刚说完  别让我又去找他
I just hung up. Don't make me call him back.

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
我也要戴这个吗
Should I be wearing all that?

185
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,120
我建议你戴  这些石头脏死了
I recommend it. Those rocks are filthy.

186
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,880
那不必了
I'm good.

187
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,620
上帝创造了尘土  不会有什么伤害
God made dirt. Dirt don't hurt.

188
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,920
要先干什么
Where do we start?

189
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
第一步  把砾石放进漏勺里
The first step is to put the gravel in these colanders,

190
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,880
筛一下  收集灰尘
and then sift it over the tray to collect the dust.

191
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,200
有点像在大街上捡钱
It's like finding money in the street.

192
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,240
你为什么总是念叨钱
Why do you care so much about money?

193
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,340
你看过《回到未来》  当他们爸爸最后有钱了
You saw Back to the Future, when their dad's rich at the end,

194
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,550
他的老婆就很苗条  更加爱他
his wife is all skinny and loves him way more.

195
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,820
所以你希望你的老婆因为你有钱而喜欢你
So you want a wife who loves you because you have money?

196
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,340
苗条的老婆
A skinny wife.

197
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,500
我有件东西要给你
I have something for you.

198
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,260
你说你想要个十字架
You said you wanted a cross,

199
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,060
这个是我像你这么大的时候戴着的
and this is the one I used to wear when I was your age.

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,320
真漂亮
It's so pretty.

201
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,360
很高兴你喜欢它
I'm glad you like it.

202
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,900
它总能提醒你  无论你在何处
It's a nice reminder that wherever you are,

203
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,780
上帝与你同在
god is always with you.

204
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,520
你想戴上它  对我来说意义重大
And it means a lot to me that you want to wear it.

205
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,060
谢谢你  妈妈  我现在祷告
Thanks, mom. I'm gonna pray right now.

206
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,460
上帝啊  又是我  密西
God, it's missy again.

207
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,960
如果你能听清楚些  是因为我戴了一个十字架
If you can hear me better, it's 'cause I'm wearing a cross now.

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,220
请让我星期六能多多击球
Please let me get a lot of hits on Saturday.

209
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,920
如果他们的明星投手摔断了胳膊
And if their star pitcher breaks his arm or gets run over

210
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,560
或者被卡车碾过去了  也行
by a truck, I'd totally be okay with that.

211
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,880
阿门
Amen.

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,040
阿门
Amen.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
现在再一次筛粉末
Now we have to sift the powder again

214
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,900
因为铂粒子极其小
because the platinum particles are extremely small,

215
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,340
不过是几个原子
sometimes no more than just a few atoms.

216
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,220
如果我像你一样聪明  我就去股市驰骋
If I was as smart as you, I'd play the stock market.

217
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
或者去《价格猜猜看》节目
Or go on price is right.

218
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,800
我更希望把时间花在重要的事情上
I'd rather spend my time focusing on important things,

219
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,680
比如探索宇宙到底是如何运转的
like figuring out how the universe works.

220
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,740
要是你知道宇宙是如何运转的了  然后呢
So, say you figure out how the universe works. Then what?

221
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,200
我还不确定  不过
I'm not sure, but in the meantime,

222
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,740
我同意理查德·费曼所说的
I agree with Richard feynman.

223
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,880
仅仅是思考和研究就已经让我快乐
I simply enjoy the pleasure of finding things out.

224
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,260
我也同意野兽男孩说的
I agree with the Beastie Boys.

225
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,240
应当为派对自由权而奋战
You got to fight for your right to party.

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
有个人的哲学观点很好
Well, it's good to have a personal philosophy.

227
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,080
-接下来干啥  -制造化学熔剂
- What's next? - We create a chemical flux

228
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,340
用的是硼砂  碳酸钠
by combining borax, sodium carbonate,

229
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,940
一氧化铅和粉末
lead oxide and flour.

230
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,840
你知不知道  谢尔顿和乔吉
Did you know Sheldon and Georgie

231
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,130
在一块做东西吗
are working on something together?

232
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,570
挺好的  你知道吗
That's nice. And guess what...

233
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,770
密西问我她能不能戴十字架
Missy asked me if she could wear a cross.

234
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,920
她正在卧室里做祷告呢
She's in her bedroom saying prayers right now.

235
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,110
我可不喜欢这样
Hmm. I don't like it.

236
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,660
你在说什么  我们的孩子在乖乖听话
What are you talking about? Our kids are behaving.

237
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,270
正是  所以坏事才要发生
Exactly. Something bad's gonna happen.

238
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,940
你就不能心存感恩吗
Why can't you just be thankful?

239
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,500
因为那就是生活给你当头一棒的时候  玛丽
Because that's when life kicks you right in the plums, Mary.

240
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,720
爸爸  你的电钻呢
Dad, where's your power drill?

241
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,890
干嘛
Why?

242
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,920
我们的烤箱达不到两千度
Our oven doesn't reach 2,000 degrees,

243
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,460
所以我们打算用垃圾桶
so we're going to make a homemade kiln

244
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,800
自制一个窑
out of a garbage can.

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,300
当头一棒来了
And there go the plums.

246
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,980
你们俩打算把房子烧了吗
Are you two trying to burn down the house?

247
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,170
没有  我们打算从砾石里提取铂
No, we're trying to make platinum out of gravel.

248
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,440
不准做两千度的烤箱
You're not building a 2,000-degree oven.

249
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,340
好吧  我本来还打算让你分一杯羹
Fine. Just so you know, I was gonna cut you in.

250
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,910
就这么算了  你可以为去派对而战斗
Really? You'll fight for your right to party

251
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,210
却要放弃可以做一个
but not for your right to make a device

252
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,160
熔点超过铅的设备的机会
that'll exceed the melting point of lead?

253
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,170
闭嘴吧
Shut up.

254
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,150
"你就不能心存感恩吗"
Ooh, "Why can't you be thankful?"

255
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,830
你怎么了
What's your problem?

256
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,750
爸妈不同意我做一个窑
Mom and dad won't let me build a kiln,

257
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,240
乔治和我就不能完成我们的实验了
so Georgie and I can't finish our experiment.

258
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,040
别告诉我  我才不管窑是什么东西
Before you tell me, I don't care what a kiln is.

259
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,490
那你就永远不会知道那是一个高温烤箱
Okay, but you'll never know it's a high-temperature oven.

260
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,300
如果你不开心  就问问上帝吧
If you're unhappy, just ask god for help.

261
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,570
我不相信上帝
I don't believe in god.

262
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,900
他听得见的
He can hear you.

263
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
他知道你表现得如何
He knows if you've been bad or good.

264
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,820
就像圣诞老人一样  但他也可以送你下地狱
Like Santa, but he can send you to hell.

265
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,930
我才不要求魔法生物
I'm not going to ask some magical being

266
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,220
来解决我的问题
to solve my problems.

267
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,490
我请他帮我击球  他帮了
I asked him to help me with my batting, and he did.

268
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,980
美术教室里有个陶窑  我们可以用它
There's a pottery kiln in art class. We can use that.

269
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,140
乔吉  我有办法了
Georgie, I figured it out!

270
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,180
做得好  但那不算我的一个愿望
Good job, but that does not count as one of my wishes.

271
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,840
为什么要鬼鬼祟祟的
Why are we being sneaky?

272
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,220
你说我们被允许进来了
I thought you said we have permission.

273
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,090
是啊  我只是不想让别人知道我们的铂金
We do. I just don't want anybody knowing about our platinum.

274
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,680
聪明  上周  我炫耀自己带了奶油饼干
Smart. Last week, I bragged about having a nutter butter,

275
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,120
但有只老鼠把它从我的午餐袋里偷走了
and some rat stole it right out of my lunch bag.

276
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,650
好吧  那肯定不是我干的
Well, it sure wasn't me.

277
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,940
然后我把球打得从右外野手的头上飞过去了
And then I hit it over the right fielder's head.

278
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,820
听起来你练得不错
Sounds like you had a good practice.

279
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,270
是的  教练说他准备让我当第四位击球员
I did. Coach said he's gonna have me hit cleanup.

280
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,920
密西
Missy,

281
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,260
能用你的十字架蹭蹭我的球棒吗
will you rub your cross on my bat?

282
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,250
不行
No.

283
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,620
你一直这么做吗
Have you been doing that?

284
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,290
蹭我自己的球棒  挺管用的
On mine. It's working great.

285
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,590
求你了
Please?

286
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,080
给你一美元
I'll give you a dollar.

287
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,080
好吧
Fine.

288
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,570
你干嘛呢你
What do you think you're doing?

289
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,800
分享上帝的爱并赚点外快
Sharing god's love and making some cash.

290
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,300
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

291
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,860
这一美元给你行吗
How about I give you the dollar?

292
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,710
上帝的爱与金钱无关
God's love has nothing to do with money.

293
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,500
那教堂里的捐款盘是怎么回事
What about the collection plate at church?

294
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,450
那不一样
That is different.

295
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,230
我就是从那拿的这一美元
That's where I found this dollar.

296
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:51,960
好吧
Okay.

297
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,160
拜拜
Bye.

298
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,500
所以现在我们就等着混凝土粉末溶解
So now we just wait for the concrete dust to dissolve

299
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,700
还有铅融化
and the lead to melt?

300
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,520
就是这样
That's exactly right.

301
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,150
我知道  我听到了
I know. I listen.

302
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,890
那你听懂了吗
And you understand it? -

303
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,150
我干销售的  我不需要懂我说的话
I work in sales. I don't need to know what I'm talking about

304
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,370
来让它听起来更好
to make it sound good.

305
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,080
难道你不认为了解你所销售的产品
Don't you think it would make you better at your job

306
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,200
会使你的工作做得更好吗
if you understood the products you were selling?

307
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,080
不了  人们不会想了解事实的
No. People don't want to hear facts.

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,070
我想
I do.

309
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,310
正常人不会想了解事实
Normal people don't want to hear facts.

310
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,590
我就是正常人
I'm normal.

311
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,690
你是吗
Are you?

312
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,450
不是  我很特别
No, I'm special.

313
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,560
-会出现这种情况吗  -可能出问题了
- Is it supposed to be doing that? - Something's wrong.

314
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,080
可能是我们没有筛掉所有的橡胶
Maybe we didn't sift out all the rubber.

315
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,970
我觉得它要着火了
I think it's burning.

316
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,050
好的  好的  冷静  我来解决它
Okay. Okay, calm down. I'll handle it.

317
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,450
我没法淡定了
I'm having difficulty remaining calm.

318
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,280
快  快  快  快
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

319
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,450
我现在淡定多了
I'm feeling more calm now.

320
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,920
-你们在想啥呢  -那个
- What were you thinking?- Well...

321
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,370
我不想听解释
I don't want to hear excuses.

322
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,210
你俩差点把学校烧了
You could've burned the school down.

323
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,060
有什么想为你们自己辩解的吗
What do you have to say for yourselves?

324
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,170
不是不想听我的解释吗
I thought you didn't want to hear my excuses.

325
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,810
不  我们不是闯进了教室
Oh, no, we didn't break into the classroom.

326
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,630
乔吉得到了老师的批准
Georgie had permission from the teacher.

327
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,330
现在这都不重要了
That is not important right now.

328
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,130
所以你们觉得老师会同意
So you think a teacher said it was okay

329
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,800
让一个十岁的孩子和一个傻蛋
for a ten-year-old and an idiot

330
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,460
无人监管时  用两千度的烤箱吗
to use a 2,000-degree oven unsupervised?

331
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,010
你个骗子
You fibber.

332
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,560
你还偷走了我的奶油饼干
You also stole my nutter butter.

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
你在生我的气吗
Are you mad at me?

334
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,050
不
No.

335
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,040
你确定
You sure?

336
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,430
因为爸爸早餐喝啤酒时  你的表情才会这样
'Cause that's how you look when dad had that breakfast beer.

337
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,600
老实说  我有点担心  祈祷这事
To be honest, I'm a little concerned that I have given you

338
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,940
我给了你错误的引导
the wrong impression about how prayer works.

339
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,930
我懂  向上帝要东西  然后他会给我
I get it. I ask God for stuff, he gives it to me.

340
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,940
又不难
It's not rocket science.

341
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,200
密西  上帝不保证愿望实现
Missy, god does not grant wishes.

342
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,840
那他会带给我好运
So he gave me good luck?

343
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,160
不是好运
It's not luck.

344
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,870
好运是一个机遇  而上帝自有安排
Luck is chance, and God has a plan.

345
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,200
对啊  他的安排就是满足我的祷告
Right, and his plan is to give me what I want when I pray.

346
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,370
所以他才这么厉害
That's why he's so cool.

347
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,650
不  我  我是说  他是很厉害
No. I... I mean, he is cool,

348
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,390
但有些时候这不会成为他的安排
but sometimes that might not be his plan.

349
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,720
如果他自有安排
Then what's the point of praying

350
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,320
那祷告的意义何在
if he's just gonna do what he wants?

351
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,670
你向上帝祷告不是为了要东西
You don't pray to god to get things.

352
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,010
你是为了与上帝建立一种关系
You pray to build a relationship with him.

353
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,010
太复杂了
This is too complicated.

354
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,670
我还是继续用它蹭球棒
I'm just gonna keep rubbing this thing on my bat

355
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,610
赢得比赛
and kicking butt.

356
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,080
好  够了  取下来
Okay, that is it. Take it off.

357
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,420
不  我需要它  周六就要打比赛了
No, I need it. The game's Saturday.

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,080
有很多比棒球更重要的事
There are more important things than baseball.

359
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,580
交出来
Now, hand it over.

360
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,430
神啊  捂住你的耳朵
God, cover your ears.

361
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,770
妈的
Damn it.

362
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,460
密西·库珀
Missy Cooper!

363
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,170
你还没准备好  把项链还回来
You are not ready for that. You give that back.

364
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,800
你啊  回房间
Oh, you... get!

365
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,040
上帝  我现在真的很需要你
Lord, I really need you right now.

366
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,280
我努力引导家人追随着您的圣光
I have tried so hard to lead my family to your light,

367
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,720
但目前为止  谢尔顿不相信您存在
but so far, Sheldon doesn't believe in you,

368
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,440
密西觉得您是变魔术的
missy thinks you're a magic trick,

369
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,160
您也不是青春美少女
and you're not a teenage girl,

370
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,270
所以乔吉根本不会想着您
so Georgie doesn't think about you at all.

371
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,510
我从未想过  我会夺走自己孩子的十字架
I never thought I'd take a cross away from my own child,

372
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,600
但我别无选择啊
but what choice did I have?

373
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,340
她用十字架蹭运动器材
She was rubbing it on sporting equipment.

374
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,660
我从没觉得有什么错误的祈祷方式
I didn't think there was a wrong way to pray,

375
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,950
但给了她之后  我才发现有
but leave it to that girl to find one.

376
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,760
请您赐予我力量  继续引导我的家人相信您
Please give me the strength to keep guiding my family to you.

377
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,460
我一个人做不来  阿门
I can't do it on my own. Amen.

378
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,160
大家今天过得怎么样
So, how was everybody's day?

379
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,520
挺好的  是么
That good, huh?

380
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,080
我们就做个祷告吧
How about we just say grace?

381
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,130
你想让他赐予我们食物吗  呵呵
You're gonna ask him to bless the food? Interesting.

382
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,240
够了
That is enough.

383
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,510
拜托
Oh, come on.

384
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,600
我要是不知道发生了什么
How can I appreciate all this tension

385
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,300
怎么能感激这种紧张气氛呢
if I don't know what it's about?

386
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,150
老妈把我十字架没收了  我周六还要打比赛呢
Mom took my cross away, and I have a game on Saturday.

387
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,940
你为什么这么做  她才走出低谷
Why would you do that? She's out of the slump.

388
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,690
她那是亵渎神灵
She was being sacrilegious.

389
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,860
玛丽  这是运动
Mary, this is sports.

390
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,820
有任何东西起作用  你都不能破坏它
When something's working, you do not mess with it.

391
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,430
我不会改变主意的  上帝不是好运符
I am not changing my mind. God is not a good-luck charm.

392
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,940
那所有在进入击球区前
Well, how about all the players that kiss their crosses

393
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,820
亲吻十字架的球员呢
before they go in the batter's box?

394
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,210
那是他们和自己妈妈的事
They can take it up with their mommies.

395
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,690
所以她终于能打出好球了
So she's finally hitting good,

396
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,800
你就让她完全失去希望去打比赛
and you're gonna let her go to that game all up in her head?

397
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,940
她和上帝的关系
Her relationship with god is more important

398
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,370
比在赛场里击中几个球更重要
than getting some hits in a baseball game.

399
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,880
太好了  他俩自己掐起来了
This is perfect. They're mad at each other.

400
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,170
我们安全了
Takes the heat off us.

401
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,340
谢谢  我完全不懂发生了什么
Thank you. I had no idea what was going on.

402
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,960
玛丽  把十字架还给她
Mary, give her the cross back.

403
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,510
当她准备好了  我会的
When she is ready for it, I will.

404
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,860
我首饰盒里有一堆十字架
I have a bunch of crosses in my jewelry box.

405
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,800
你可以随便拿一个你喜欢的
You can take any one you want.

406
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,220
我不要别的十字架  我只要我的幸运十字架
I don't want another cross. I want my lucky cross.

407
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,800
这就是为什么她没准备好
And that is exactly why she is not ready.

408
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,190
我们来祷告
Let's say grace.

409
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,770
保佑我们  主  保佑我们即将得到的食物
Bless us, lord, for the food we are about to receive,

410
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,730
以及准备了这些食物的人  阿门
and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.

411
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,050
-阿门  -阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

412
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,890
很开心你们不追究
I'm glad we're no longer in trouble

413
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,690
我们差点烧掉学校的事了
for almost burning the school down.

414
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,520
我们就来说说这事儿吧
Let's talk about that.

415
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,670
乔吉
Georgie.

416
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,720
怎么了
Yeah?

417
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,600
你还想快速致富吗
Are you still interested in getting rich quick?

418
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,640
不想了  我想像个笨蛋一样脚踏实地
No, I want to do it slow like a chump.

419
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,030
算了
Oh. Never mind.

420
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,730
说吧  谢尔顿
Tell me, Sheldon.

421
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,640
我突然想到
It occurred to me that

422
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,520
一个产生正向现金流的好方法
a good way to generate a positive cash flow

423
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,960
组织流行歌曲
would be to curate popular songs

424
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,000
使其数字化
and make them available in a digital form.

425
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,210
可能是在一个同时兼具电话
Possibly on a small device that could also be used

426
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,810
甚至相机功能的设备上
as a phone or even a camera.

427
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,780
想得美吧  一部电话  相机  音乐机器
Right. A phone, camera, music machine.

428
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,530
出去
Get out of here.

429
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,990
嗨  密西
Hey, Missy.

430
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,930
过来
Come here.

431
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,190
怎么了  我下一个上场
What? I'm up next.

432
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,410
我知道  给
I know. Here.

433
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,560
别和你妈说
Don't tell your mother.

434
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,810
-这次我想靠自己  -你确定吗
- I think I want to do this on my own. - You sure?

435
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,650
以防妈是对的  我不想让上帝生气
Just in case mom's right, I don't want to make God mad.

436
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,810
三振出局
Strike three. You're out.

437
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,860
行吧  去拿下他们
All right. Go get 'em.

438
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,330
-一振  -爸
- Strike one! - Dad!

439
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,490
来了
Coming!
