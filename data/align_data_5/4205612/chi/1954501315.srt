我已经枪毙了

"比沉默的羔羊里的女性屠宰场还糟糕"这说法
"Worse than that girl-pit in Silence of the Lambs."

5
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,135
最起码她们那里还有清静的时候

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:17,072
听着 没人会租这样的破公寓
Look, no one's gonna pay money to rent this dump.

7
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,239
我们自己都半年没交租了
We haven't in six months.

8
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,125
每个威廉斯堡人都靠在"空中食宿"网站

9
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:24,461
出租破房子赚钱

15
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:43,619
富有古典魅力 允许饲养宠物

16
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,427

"健身房?"
"Gym?"

22
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,223
{\an8}健身房"Gym"与人名"Jim"发音相同

23
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,223
有两个 楼上的弯男Jim
Two. Gay Jim upstairs,

24
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:01,557
还有一个对门的那个
and straight Jim across the hall

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,026
喝高了才变弯的直男Jim
who's only gay when he's drunk.

26
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:06,220
"什么时候可以入住?
"When is your space available?

27
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:07,888

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,113

39
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:44,395

你们把房子租给阿拉伯人了?
You rented to Arabs?

41
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,181
{\an8}阿拉伯人"Arabs"和空中食宿"Airbnb"谐音

42
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,983
希望你们还能把房子收回

43
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,188
他们都有恐怖主义的倾向
They tend to be a TAD territorial.

44
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,827
"空中食宿"是一个给外地人
Airbnb is an agency that rents to out-of-towners

45
00:01:56,827 --> 00:02:00,112
以及想密会小三的当地人租房子的网站
and I'm guessing local men cheating on their wives.

46
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,866
我成功了

我再说一遍
Let me rephrase that.

00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,743
怎么可能!
How!

54
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,912
因为我们的宣传标语给力
I found the perfect sales pitch.

55
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:20,382
"来梦想泯灭之地居住吧"?
"Stay at the place where dreams die"?

56
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,302

57
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:25,254

00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,757
像"淘金热"时代的男人轻轻爱抚吗?

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,487
妞 你真棒
Girl, you are good.

64
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,439

想要重修旧好的夫妻
Um, a married couple looking to reconnect.

122
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,956
为了照片效果 我裁掉了几英寸边缘

123

你懂这技巧的
You know the drill.

124
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,544
你们为什么要住在这里?
So why the hell are you staying here?

125
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:37,915
难道是为自己美貌消失之后的生活做准备?
Is this training for when your looks run out?

126
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,301
快看 这厨房好可爱啊!

提问 你们瞎成这样怎么走秀的?

在这里 你们至少能感受到两个不同的季节

我以前和一个邻居说过话 结果
I talked to my neighbor once and the next thing you know,

152
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:52,131
我收到了娜奥米・沃茨的一封长信
I have this long letter from Naomi Watts

153
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,394
告诫我离她丈夫远点
saying, "Leave my husband alone."

154
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:58,464
我们现在已经认识5分钟了
So we've known each other like five minutes already.

155
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,082
我的免费胸罩呢?
Where's my free bra?

156
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:02,084
我现在穿着的这个只剩下框架了
I mean, all that's left of this one is the frames.

157
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,840
相信我 这里面就像在演滑稽剧一样
Trust me, it's like a burlesque show under here.

158
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,021
Sophie的公寓太棒了
Sophie's apartment is amazing.

159
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:20,163
感觉就像复活节兔子勾搭上了多金女
It looks like an easter bunny banged a golden girl.

160
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,662
那个淋雨喷头真好
That was some showerhead.

161
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:27,699
我都想和它结婚了 可惜它有主了...
I'd marry it, but it's already attached...

162
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:29,501
他老婆是墙
to the wall.

163
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,543
Max 你在哪?
Max?

164
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,378
我在这儿!
Here!

165
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,347
这床就像是一个
Oh, this bed is like being in the womb

166
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:45,884
没有二手烟的子宫
without all the second-hand smoke.

167
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,435
玛莎和莉莉都超友好
Martha and Lily were super-sweet.

168
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,555
能重新和名人们交朋友真的是让我太兴奋了
So exciting to be back hanging with celebrities.

169
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:53,057
是啊 也许现在你能换个新的名人故事了
Yeah and maybe now you can get a new celebrity story.

170
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,926
我已经听腻那个别人说你背影
I was getting really tired of hearing how someone thought

171
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:58,229
像格温妮丝・帕特洛的故事了
you were Gwyneth Paltrow from behind.

172
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,532
我到现在还受宠若惊呢
Still flattering.

173
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,687
有笑声?
Laughter?

174
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,572
我们的公寓里有笑声?
Coming from our apartment?

175
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,207
你觉得她们在笑什么?
What do you think they're laughing at?

176
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,861
估计是看到某张自动取款机票据上的余额了
Probably found our account balance on an ATM slip.

177
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,712
我打赌一定是玛莎讲了个笑话
I bet Martha said something funny.

178
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,214
她太有趣了
She's hilarious.

179
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,549
要知道 像她那么漂亮的人
You know, for someone who's so pretty,

180
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:20,084
根本不需要有个性
she never had to develop a personality.

181
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,470
我要去看看
I'm gonna go see.

182
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,255
Max 推我一下
Max, give me a shove.

183
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,692
就当是为以后真站悬崖边了做准备
This is good practice for the eventual cliff.

184
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:38,102
啤酒和翅膀
Beers and wings.

185
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:39,604
啤机和翅膀
Beers and wings.

186
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,606
派对开始了
Now it's a party.

187
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,908
Max 你还记得我们公寓很热的时候
Max, you know how when it gets hot down there,

188
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,613
我们就干坐着 大汗漓淋 拿着电风扇吹屁股吗?
we just sit, sweat, and point the fan at our junk?

189
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,082
她们和我们不太一样
They do it a little differently.

190
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,917
她们一边穿着内裤跳舞
They are dancing in their underwear,

191
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,469
一边喝啤酒
drinking beers.

192
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,276
那又怎样? 转角处的那家伙天天这么干
So? The guy on the corner does that all the time.

193
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,635
我被那些啤酒吸引住了
I can't take my eyes off those beers.

194
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:14,489
嘿! 你们好啊
Hey! Hi, you guys.

195
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,310
你们想下来喝点酒
You wanna come down, and have some beers,

196
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,145
凉快一会吗?
and cool off?

197
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,864
马上就来!
Be right down!

198
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,274
要是我有那些翅膀就好了 这样我就能快点飞下去了
Now I wish I had those wings, I could get down there faster.

199
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,377
说吧 是什么大消息啊?
Okay. So what is this big news?

200
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,996
是卫生检疫的人发现
Did the health inspector find out

201
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,912
我们的人造蟹肉其实是猫肉?
that the imitation crab meat is cat?

202
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,335
严格意义上来讲 是人造猫肉
Technically, it's imitation cat,

203
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:46,004
不过我们想说的不是这个
but that's not what we're announcing.

204
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,672
我来了
I'm here.

205
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,674
快点说 我正忙着呢
And make this snappy. I'm in the middle of something.

206
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,096
享受青春期?
Puberty?

207
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,346
不 我刚刚在和"Ripley信不信"节目通电话
No. I was on a call with Ripley's Believe It or Not

208
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:58,066
告诉他们你们还在这里工作
to inform them that you still work here.

209
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,351
但他们不信
And they didn't believe it.

210
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:02,820
好了 我们有几个朋友要来吃饭
Okay. We have some friends coming in for a meal

211
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,990
我不希望你们们反应过度 让我们难堪
and we don't want you guys to embarrass us and overreact.

212
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,992
亲爱的 我从来不会反应过度
Darlin', I don't overreact.

213
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,862
我是个七十多岁的老头 还有心脏病
I'm 70-something years old with a history of heart trouble.

214
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:14,032
我控制得住
I keep it in check.

215
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,664
嘿 Max! Caroline!
Hey, Max! Caroline!

216
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:22,040
我的心脏病药就在口袋里
And I keep my heart pills in my pocket.

217
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,425
我先走了 虽然我很享受这景象
Excuse me, much as I enjoy the view,

218
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:26,594
但我还想活到一百岁 听Al Roker
I really want that "100th Birthday" shout out

219
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:28,680
给我祝寿呢
from Al Roker.

220
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:34,018
是的 她们是维密的模特 还是我们的朋友
Yes, they're Victoria's Secret models and our friends.

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,355
昨晚我们一夜没睡 在说凯特・摩丝的坏话呢
Last night we all stayed up late trashing Kate Moss.

222
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,357

223
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,894
不 我穿错毛线背心了

脸 身子和性格也都错了
You also wore the wrong face, body, and personality.

225
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,199
Max 我们去打个招呼吧
Max, let's go say hi.

226
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,200
我看上去怎么样?
How do I look?

227
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:50,952
像个女服务员
Like a waitress.

228
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,402
我靠 本来这就是服务员的制服 是吧?
Damn it, it's the waitress uniform, isn't it?

229
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:56,591
室友们 你们好吗?
What's up, homies?

230
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:57,575

我们认识已经一整天了
Well, it's been a whole day since we met,

233

234
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:03,493
Max啊!

235
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:05,300
干嘛? 这个胸罩就要断气了

也可以来几条新内裤
Could also use some new underwear.

天啊 淡定一点
Jeez, pull it back.

248
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,740
你表现得比红毯上的索菲娅・维加拉(女星)
You're acting needier than Sofia Vergara

249
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:32,744

我的招牌菜 冰棍
My specialty, popsicles.

254
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:43,788
我发现面对着厨房 不停地用舌头
I find they taste best when sucked slowly,

255
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,542
慢慢地吮吸时 味道是最好的
using plenty of tongue, facing the kitchen.

256
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,629
我无法相信我们没有被邀请
I can't believe we're not invited

257
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,393
参加自己公寓的最大型派对
to the biggest party in our apartment

258
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:03,183
除了蚂蚁发现了你的糖豆那次
since those ants found your jelly beans.

259
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,713
呦吼!
Yoo-hoo!

260
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:09,067
你们好 我们就这么被晾在上面
Hi, so we're just up here hangin' out.

261
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,452
做自己的事儿
Doin' our Thang.

262
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,237
对不起 美女 我们吵醒你了吗?
Oh, sorry, girl. Did we wake you?

263
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,751
回去睡觉吧
Go back to sleep.

264
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,077
"回去睡觉"?
"Go back to sleep"?

265
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,795
为什么她觉得我们这么差劲呢?
Why does she think we're so lame?

266
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,450
我不知道
Um, I don't know.

267
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,149
可能是因为你一直在说
Maybe it's 'cause you're throwing around words

268
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:28,487
像"呦吼"和"事儿"这种话 像个带着"奇多"(零食)
like "Yoo-hoo" and "Thang," Like a mom bringing cheetos

269
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,956
去参加睡衣派对的老妈
down to a slumber party.

270
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,391
这是你的错
This is your fault.

271
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:34,423
在你像个没胸罩的流浪汉一样
They were obsessed with us until you started asking

272
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:38,136
开口要文胸以后 她们就烦我们了
for bras like some bra-less homeless person.

273
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,384
音乐这么吵 我们是不可能睡着的
We're never gonna sleep with all that music.

274
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,503
看看抽屉 Sophie一定有耳塞
Check the drawer, Sophie must have ear plugs.

275
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,742
她住在你楼上 一定有耳塞
I mean, she lives upstairs from you.

276
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,311
我找到塞子了 但我不觉得是用在耳朵上的
I found plugs, but I don't think they're for your ears.

277
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,939
没事的 我们只要走下楼 打个招呼
It's fine, we'll just pop downstairs and say hello.

278
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,653
时尚圈是我的舞台
Fashion's my scene.

279
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,355
知道我看见什么了吗? 价格标签
Know what I'm seeing? That price tag.

280
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,158
把它塞回去 我得还回去的
Oh, tuck it back in, I have to return it.

281
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,860
好了 记住我们的约定
Okay. Remember our deal.

282
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:12,665
我为此起床穿衣服了 你这辈子都是我的奴隶
I got up and got dressed so you're my slave for life.

283
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,416
妞儿 你们好
Oh, hi, girls.

284
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,703
我以为你们是来送希腊外卖的人
I thought you were the man with the Greek food.

285
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:21,624
哇 看来我一定得脱脱上嘴唇的毛了
Wow, I have definitely got to start waxing my upper lip more.

286
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,876
Sophie 你怎么没去佛蒙特州?
Sophie, why aren't you in Vermont?

287
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,045
我撒谎了
Oh, I lied.

288
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,663
我没有去佛蒙特州
I didn't go to Vermont.

289
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:31,717
因为太远了 而且我不是女同
I mean, it's far and I'm not a lesbian.

290
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,219
不 我是留下监视Oleg的
No, I stayed in town to spy on Oleg.

291
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,055
我知道你们以为我很完美
I mean, I know you girls think that I'm perfect,

292
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,725
但我有疑心病
but I have trust issues.

293
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,277
那是谁的公寓?
Well then, whose apartment is that?

294
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,895
我住在Jim家
I'm staying at Jim's.

295
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,396
直的还是弯的那个?
Straight Jim's or gay Jim's?

296
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:48,367
Sophie 你忘拿包了
Sophie, you forgot your purse.

297
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,486
我觉得这是我的
Oh, I think this is mine.

298
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:53,122
开个玩笑 这是你的
Just kidding, it's yours.

299
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,575
你们好 "盐和胡椒"(女子组合)
What's up, Salt N' Pepa?

300
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,878
弯的那个
Gay Jim's.

301
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,266
妞儿 不要告诉Oleg我在这里
Oh, girls, please don't tell Oleg that I'm here.

302
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:05,801
你知道的 我一直在跟着他
You know, I've been following him around

303
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,920
看看我不在的这段时间 他会做什么
to see what he would do if I was not in town.

304
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,772
目前为止 他表现不错
And so far, you know, he's been cool.

305
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,257
但你知道古语有云
But you know the old saying:

306
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,810
"骗我一次 你真丢脸
"Cheat on me once, shame on you.

307
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,535
骗我两次 就割了你的蛋蛋装罐子里"
Cheat on me twice, your balls are in a jar."

308
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,237
天啊! 有个男的站在我们门口
Oh, my god! There's a man standing in our doorway.

309
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,272
我又有看门人了
I have a doorman again.

310
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:28,490
看到一个男的没有带着搜查令 驱逐通知
Weird to see a man standing in our doorway

311
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,326
也没有圣经就站在我们门口
without a warrant, an eviction notice,

312
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,111
真是奇怪
or a Bible.

313
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:34,163
借过一下 这是我们的公寓
Excuse me, this is our apartment.

314
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,614
对 我们一直住在这里
Yeah, we live here all the time.

315
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,166
没有新闻
No biggie.

316
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,170
没有新闻 没有电 没有租约
No biggie, and no electricity, no lease-y.

317
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,755
你好 我是Caroline 这是Max
Hi, I'm Caroline. This is Max.

318
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,756
我们住在这里
We live here.

319
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,674
名单上没有
Not according to the list.

320
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,127
先生 听我说 我们真的住这儿 我有钥匙
Sir, look, we do live here. I have a key.

321
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,963
关键就是名字在单子上 但是没有你
The key is to be on the list, which you are not.

322
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,766
好吧 我可以证明我们住这儿
Okay, I can prove we live here.

323
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,468
走到窗边 踢一下散热器的侧边
Go over to the window, kick the side of radiator,

324
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,354
有个面板会打开
a panel will open up.

325
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,385
你会发现一个吸了一半的大麻烟和另一个吸了一半的大麻烟
You'll find a half-smoked joint and another half-smoked joint.

326
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:01,945
证明了...
Proving...

327
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:04,810
证明什么? 你是个可怜虫?
What? That you're a poor pot head?

328
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:05,787
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

329
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:07,780
我无法相信我在乞求走进一个
I can't believe I'm begging to get into a place

330
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,148
我一直想离开的地方
I've been trying to get out of.

331
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,282
这是一个非常高级的派对
It's a very exclusive party.

332
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,617
这是间破公寓
It's a dump.

333
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,153
我知道的 我住在这里
I should know. I live here.

334
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:22,011
今晚简直不能更糟了
This night couldn't get any worse.

335
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:22,988
把灯关了
Turn that light off.

336
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,280
我正在用我的夜视镜
I'm watching the Victoria's Secret super model party

337
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:28,050
看维密超模派对
with my night vision goggles.

338
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,302
结果更糟了
And updating.

339
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,221
Oleg 你怎么进来这里的?
Oleg, how did you get in here?

340
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,389
你以为呢?
How do you think?

341
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,740
这是我女朋友的公寓
It's my girlfriend's apartment.

342
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:37,192
我闯进来的
I broke in.

343
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,895
没错 Oleg 这是你女朋友的公寓
Yes, Oleg, it's your girlfriend's apartment

344
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,680
你还黑灯坐着
where you're sitting in the dark,

345
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,732
用夜视镜看窗户外的模特
watching models out the window with night vision goggles.

346
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,652
嘿! 我穿着裤子呢!
Hey! My pants are on!

347
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,671
不 你没穿!
No, they are not!

348
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,173
不是我的错
Not my fault.

349
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,509
楼下有五个维密超模?
Five Victoria's Secret super models downstairs?

350
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,978
裤子是自己跑掉的
They took themselves off.

351
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,864
所以你想说什么? 你才是受害者吗?
So what are you saying? You're the victim here?

352
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,382
要是Sophie回来 看见你坐在这儿
What would Sophie say if she came home

353
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:01,867
她会怎么说?
and saw you sitting here?

354
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:05,037
她会说"别占着望远镜"
She'd say, "stop hogging the goggles."

355
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,005
Oleg 我得告诉你:
Oleg, let me just say this:

356
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,374
佛蒙特州比你想得要近
Vermont is closer than you think.

357
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:10,926
我不知道我们的争论跑题到哪儿了
I don't know where this argument is going,

358
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,928
但我要去参加超模派对
but I'm going to that damn supermodel party.

359
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,682
Oleg 太迟了 我要冒着极大风险提醒你
Oleg, it's late, I'm gonna lay this on the line for you.

360
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,400
你不是乔治・克鲁尼
You're no George Clooney.

361
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:21,520
你连乔治・科斯坦萨(喜剧角色)都不是
You're not even George Costanza.

362
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,355
这些床单整理得太棒了
These sheets are amazing

363
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,891
你不可能整理得比Sophie还好
and you are never gonna do better than Sophie.

364
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:30,813
她不仅性感 还显然没有嗅觉
She is hot and clearly has no sense of smell.

365
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:31,780
我爱Sophie
I love Sophie.

366
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,701
我会回家的
I'll go home.

367
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,286
转念一想 我不相信自己能
On second thought, I don't trust myself

368
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,620
经过你们公寓而不进去
to walk by your apartment.

369
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,290
最好把我锁在这里
Better lock me in here.

370
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,543
Caroline! Max! 下来! 快点!
Caroline! Max! Come down here! Hurry!

371
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,744
我就知道! 看见没 Max?
I knew it! See, Max?

372
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,079
她们在求我们去
They're begging us to come.

373
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:48,413
我又回来啦
I'm back again.

374
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,748
你来吗?
Are you coming?

375
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,133
哦 让我想想
Oh, let me think.

376
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,601
是去楼下参加露天酒会呢 还是这上面
Downstairs with an open bar or up here,

377
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:56,004
独自和穿着紧而不白小内内的Oleg一起呢?
alone, with Oleg in his tighty-not-that-whities?

378
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,809
我们要把你绑起来吗?
Should we tie you up?

379
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,680
不了 那会让我更性奋的
No, it'll just make me hornier.

380
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,987
我就知道她们会让我们参加派对!
I knew they wanted us to come to the party!

381
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,272
她们怎么会不愿意呢?
How could they not?

382
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:14,990
昨晚我教佩特拉怎么吃面包
Last night I taught Petra how to eat bread

383
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,327
而不用先把它撕成小片
without tearing it into little pieces first.

384
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,829
别硬闯 我以前是海豹突击队的
Don't try it. I was a Navy Seal.

385
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,281
你以为你很厉害吗?
You think you're tough?

386
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:24,416
我曾经在装冰箱的纸箱里住了一个月
I lived in a refrigerator box for a month.

387
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,784
上头什么都没有
With no top.

388
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,587
不是说盒子 而是我的上半身
Not the box. Me.

389
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,422
Max Caroline 进来!
Max, Caroline, get in here!

390
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,624
嘿! 瞧瞧 我们是被邀请的
Hey! See we were invited.

391
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,627
因为我们是头号贵宾
'cause we're "A" list.

392
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:39,264
厕所堵了 我要你修好它 拜托了
The toilet is clogged and I need you to take care of it, please.

393
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,437
是房屋看管人的"头号人选"罢了
"A" list as in "A" Janitor list.

394
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,688
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

395
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,640
你们能打电话给前台吗?
Can one of you call the concierge?

396
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,776
当然 Caroline!
Sure. Caroline!

397
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,073
等等... 你们不会只是因为
Wait, wait, wait... you didn't just call us

398
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,029
厕所堵了才叫我们下来的吧?
down here 'cause the toilet's clogged, did you?

399
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,654
不是
No.

400
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,693
幸好
Okay, good.

401
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,116
厨房水槽也堵了
The kitchen sink is backed up, too.

402
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,785
厕所这边 我负责修
But, toilet, I got this.

403
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,653
我几乎天生就是干这个的
I was almost born in one.

404
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:04,489
不好意思 借过 借过
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

405
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,909
好了 大家都冷静
All right, everyone just calm down.

406
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:12,080
没必要大惊小怪
No need to overreact.

407
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,286
那就是我们在广告中所说的游泳池
And there's the pool we mentioned in our ad.

408
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:18,337
天啊
Oh, boy.

409
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:21,340
没错 还有漂浮者
Yup, we got some floaters.

410
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,841
Caroline 我需要马桶塞
Caroline, I'm gonna need the plunger

411
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,560
再让我失个忆
and a lobotomy.

412
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,678
老式马桶经常出现这种情况
This happens with vintage toilets.

413
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,181
算是一种古典魅力
Part of their old-world charm.

414
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:32,684
有些魅力卡在你的丝瓜筋上了
We got some charm stuck on your loofah.

415
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:33,936
嘿 各位 还记得昨晚
Hey guys, remember last night

416
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,237
我们是怎么咬面包
how we just bit into that bread

417
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,024
而不撕碎它的吗? 多么欢乐的时光
without chewing it? Good times.

418
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:42,828
我要那该死的马桶塞 我不想这样死
I need that damn plunger, I don't want to die this way.

419
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,865
找到了 但它被别的东西勾住了
Got it, but it's caught on something.

420
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,376
这是什么破公寓啊?
What kind of a dump is this?

421
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:00,879
嘿! 你想要体验威廉姆斯堡生活 这就是啦!
Hey! You wanted the Williamsburg experience, this is it!

422
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:10,973
好消息 玛莎 我把你的熨斗
Good news, Martha. I have your flat iron

423
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,609
恢复得和以前差不多了
looking pretty much back to normal.

424
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,529
真好 你留着吧
Oh, that's good. Keep it.

425
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,566
还有 抱歉弄脏了你的羊绒毛衣
Again, sorry about your cashmere sweaters in here.

426
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,068
但我们用光了纸巾的时候
But when we ran out of paper towels,

427
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,406
你确实大叫了句 "随便用什么 快把它堵上"
You did scream, "Just use anything, make it stop."

428
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,075
当然 我们会花钱把它们都干洗的
And of course, we'll pay to have them all dry cleaned.

429
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:33,412
真好心 留着它们吧
Oh, that's nice. Keep them.

430
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,464
好了 我们可以走了
Okay, we can leave.

431
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,750
我刚和我的心理治疗师讲完电话
I am off the phone with my therapist.

432
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,919
不言而喻 我们不会收你们
And it goes without saying, we won't charge you guys

433
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,087
这个周末的钱
for this weekend.

434
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,922
不行 给你
No way. Here.

435
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:47,259
你们拿着这张支票和我那治疗师的电话号码
You are taking this check and my therapist's phone number.

436
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,645
我不知道没有他你们是怎么挺过来的
I do not know how you are standing up without him.

437
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,730
什么? 拜托 这不算什么
What? Come on, this is nothing.

438
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,400
曾经一整个月 地板真的裂开 还吞了我们
One month, the floor actually opened up and swallowed us.

439
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,185
是 我们经历过更惨的
Yeah, we've been through worse.

440
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:59,938
你们互帮互助真是太酷了
Oh, it's really cool the way you two support each other.

441
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,775
对 我们是一对弹力长袜
Yup, we're a pair of support hose.

442
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,445
说到互助...
And speaking of support...

443
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,496
给你 Max
Here, Max.

444
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,114
不是吧!
No way!

445
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,750
看呐 Caroline 这是Brananza的(品牌)!
Look, Caroline, it's a Bra-nanza!

446
