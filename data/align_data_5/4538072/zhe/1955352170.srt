156
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,820
你覺得圣朱尼佩洛有多少女孩

我是說天涯何處無芳草  韋斯
I'm saying there's plenty of other girls out there for you, Wes.

160

當地的嗎  她們是死人
The locals? They're like dead people.

161
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,910
這死人也太活躍了吧
A little lively for dead people.

162
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,620
我不想搞什么無聊的浪漫  好嗎
Look, I don't want some kind of boring romance, okay?

163
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,350
像在退休之家似的
Like, Jesus, put us in a retirement home deal.

164
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,980
如果你想找人上床  選擇多的是

165
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,300
-再去泥潭那兒轉轉  -不僅僅是為了性
- Hang out at the Quagmire again. - It's not just sex.

-僅僅是性  -不  我們心有靈犀
- It was just sex. - No, we made a connection.

167
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,510
韋斯  那只是性
Wes, it was just sex.

168
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,730
-不  -沒有情感
- No-- - No roots.

169
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,530

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,130
那...應該是顯微手術吧

我的兩個膝蓋骨都磨損了
You know, both my kneecaps had kind of just worn down.

我一直不怎么喜歡這首歌  覺得有點奇怪
You know, I never got this song. Kind of weird.

179
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,760
-去跳舞嗎  -好
- Shall we dance? - Sure.

180
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,630
我猜如果當時我把心思放在電腦之類的東西上
I mean, I guess by the time I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

181
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,380
趕上第一股潮流
You know, caught that first wave,

你不知道這意味著什么
You don't know what this means.

294
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,980
這意味著樂趣
This means fun.

295
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,780
至少應該是樂趣  而現在...
Or it should. And this...

296
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,030
這可沒什么樂趣  好嗎
This is not fun, okay?

297
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,910
這不是樂趣
This is not fun.

298
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,880
你一點都不難過嗎
So you don't feel bad?

299
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,960
也許你應該感到難過  或者至少有點感覺
Maybe you should feel bad. Or at least feel something.

300
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,310
你們見過一個女孩嗎
Have you seen a girl?

301
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,290
二十多歲  棕發  戴眼鏡
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

302
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,090
天啊
Oh, jeez.

303
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,690
請告訴我你把你的痛感模塊調到零了
Please tell me you got your pain slider set to zero.

304
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,820
嗯  我想是的
Yeah, I think so.

Okay, listen.

我來這兒期間  我說過我不會...
In the time I've been here, I said I wouldn't...

怎么說呢  有感覺
I don't know, do feelings.

315
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,300
你把我嚇壞了
You freaked me out.

316

我不想喜歡上任何人
I don't want to like anyone.

所以你的出現...真是個大麻煩
So you've been just... totally fucking inconvenient.

318
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,340
那是...
It's that...

319
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,040
我不知道還有多久
I don't know how long there is.

320
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,810
我做不到  我沒為你做好準備
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.

321
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,450
想要一些...
For wanting something--

我要結婚了

下周
Next week?

325
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,790
嫁給老好人格雷格
To nice Greg?

326
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,370
-你確定要那么做嗎  -我必須那么做
- Sure you're going through with that? - I have to.

327
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,660
你必須
You have to?

328
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,930
他真的是個好人
He really is a good guy.

329
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,150
我的家人并不贊成  但...
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

330
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,880
他們阻止不了我們
they can't stop us.

331
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,210
我知道他可憐我  這讓我很生氣
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

332
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,450
但這不公平  因為他...
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

333
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,070
你說你不知道還剩多少時間
You said you don't know how much time there is.

334
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,690
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

335
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,390
他們告訴我三個月
They tell me three months.

336
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,780
已經幾乎擴散到了全身
It's spread basically everywhere.

337
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,760
他們六個月前就說還有三個月
They said three months before six months ago.

338
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,640
所以他們知道什么呢
So, you know, what do they know?

339
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,450
連點味兒都沒有
Doesn't even taste of anything.

340
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,770
-那你之后會留在這兒嗎  -不
- But so you'll stay here after? - No.

341
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,990
等我結束了  我就到此為止
When I'm done, I am done.

342
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,010
但那太瘋...我是說
But that's cra-- I mean...

343
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,380
-為什么  -理查德
- Why? - Richard.

344
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,390
那是...
That's...

345
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,060
我丈夫叫理查德
My husband's name was Richard.

346
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,440
他兩年前死了
He died just two years ago.

347
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
我們本來有機會一起待在圣朱尼佩洛
So we had the opportunity to stay in San Junipero.

348
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
他拒絕了
Pass over.

349
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,680
沒抓住機會
Didn't take it.

350
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,000
-他不想  -誰會不想要這個機會
- Didn't want to take it. - Why wouldn't anyone take it?

351
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,280
他有自己的想法
He had his viewpoint.

352
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,420
他有自己相信和不相信的東西
There were things he believed and things he didn't believe in,

353
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,920
他不相信這里
and this place was one of them.

354
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,740
連來這兒看看  體驗一下都不肯
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

355
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,890
我去
Shit.

356
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,470
我當初也不知道自己是否想來試試  但
I didn't know if I wanted to try it but...

357
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,520
我是說
I mean...

358
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,820
老天  如果沒有這個地方
Jesus, without this place,

359
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,000
我永遠不會認識你這樣的人
I never would've met someone like you.

360
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,320
-怎么不會  -不會的
- Yeah, you could have. - No, I wouldn't.

361
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,850
-我們在外面也可能會認識  -不可能
- We could have met outside all this. - No.

362
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,430
你...
You...

363
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,470
根本不會理解我
would not have got me at all.

364
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,390
不可能
At all.

365
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,110
就算我們真見面了
If we really met, I mean...

366
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,930
真的見面了  你也不會喜歡我
If we really met, you wouldn't like me.

367
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,700
咱們試試
Try me.

368
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,210
或者...你不會想和我待在一起
Or you'd-- You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

369
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,460
-你會來找我  然后  -試試啊
- You'd come and then-- - Try me.

370
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,550
何必呢
Why?

371
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,350
何必呢  有什么意義嗎
Why? What's the point?

372
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,010
怎么  你在哪  休斯敦
What? Where are you? Houston?

373
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,430
內華達州卡森城
Carson City, Nevada.

374
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,780
說吧
So come on.

375
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,080
我都說了我的
I showed you mine.

376
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,960
你在哪
Where are you?

377
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,890
-我可以自己查  -加州圣羅莎
- I can just look it up. - Santa Rosa, California.

378
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,540
-那不遠  -我不希望你...
- That's no distance. - I don't want you to--

379
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,760
我不希望你看到我  我怕...
I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...

380
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,140
我要死了
And I'm dying.

381
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
你是什么人都嚇不著我
Whatever you are can't scare me.

382
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,830
讓我去看你吧
Let me come visit.

383
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,250
我想去打個招呼
I want to say hi.

You must be Kelly.

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,220
應該就是了
I guess I must.

391
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,670
-她在等你  -謝謝
- She's waiting for you. - Thank you.

392
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,690
請
Please.

393
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,560
雖然她身體上無法做出回應
She won't be able to physically respond in any way.

394
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,160
但聽得見
But she can hear you.

395
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,490
不打擾你們了
I'll give you some privacy.

396
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,480
你好啊  小傻瓜
Hello, stupid.

397
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,020
見到你真好
It's good to see you.

398
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,170
你好
Hello.

399
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,770
不好意思
Excuse me.

400
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,790
你是凱莉嗎
Is it... Kelly?

401
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,190
我是
It is.

402
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,000
-我是格雷格  -你就是格雷格
- I'm Greg. - You're Greg?

403
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,590
真見鬼
Holy shit.

404
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,340
你能在她離去之前親自過來見她
Yeah, I think it's great that you came down here in person

405
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,560
這樣真好
before she passes over.

406
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,650
連她家人都不怎么來了  所以
Even her folks don't come visit no more so...

407
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,180
她要去世了嗎
She's passing over?

408
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,190
什么時候
When?

409
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,410
-咱們去喝杯咖啡吧  -好
- Let's go grab a coffee. - Okay.

410
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,980
-她沒告訴你嗎  -沒有
- She didn't tell you? - No, she did not.

411
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,620
說她只是來玩玩
Said she was just visiting.

412
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,610
更確切說  是體驗一下試用版
More like sampling the trial version.

413
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,820
我們才認識三年
I mean, I've only known her the past three years.

414
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,750
靠通信箱交流
We talk on the comm box.

415
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,710
她提過自己怎么會癱瘓嗎
She told you how she ended up quadriplegic?

416
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,660
她那樣有多長時間了
And how long she's been that way?

417
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,870
她21歲時  一天晚上  去父母家
One night, she's 21, comes out to her folks.

418
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,730
他們對那種事有點保守  可以這么說吧
They're a little uptight about it, you might say.

419
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,580
告訴她  他們不想要同性戀女兒
They told her they don't want a gay daughter.

420
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,450
不符合自然規律之類的
It's not natural and so forth.

421
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,650
他們大吵一架
They fight.

422
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,660
她開車駛下了車道
She gets in her car. Runs it off the road.

423
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,260
-21歲時嗎  -四十多年前了
- When she was 21? - More than 40 years back.

424
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
可以說她在床上躺了一輩子
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

425
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,110
所以圣朱尼佩洛系統對她意義重大
So the whole San Junipero system has been a big deal for her.

426
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,360
非常重大
The biggest deal.

427
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,460
當然
Of course now,

428
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,540
等她去世后  就成永久性的了
until she passes over, it goes permanent,

429
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,870
現在她每周限量五小時
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

430
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,450
大概你也是吧
I guess you're the same.

431
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,470
他們按量來  不肯給多了
They ration it out. They don't trust us with more.

432
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,470
據說給太多你們會瘋的
They say you go crazy if you have too much, you know?

433
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,590
不離開座位  心智與身體分離
You don't leave your seat. You disassociate body from mind.

434
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,050
說得好像有哪家老人院里不是這樣的
Like that doesn't happen in every senior home already.

435
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,030
這系統以治療為目的
The system's there for therapeutic reasons,

436
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,770
沉浸式懷舊療法
immersive nostalgia therapy.

437
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,570
將你投入全是記憶的世界里
Plunge you into a world of memories.

438
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,460
對阿茲海默癥有幫助  他們是這么說的
Helps with Alzheimer's, that's what they say.

439
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,800
小小的幸運
Small mercies.

440
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,460
那么
So...

441
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,830
結婚的事
About this marriage...

442
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,000
本州的安樂死得經過三層確認
The state's got a triple lockdown on euthanasia cases.

443
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,910
你得有醫生  病人
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,

444
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,760
和一位家庭成員的簽字
the patient, a family member.

445
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,810
防止有的病人
It's to stop folks from passing over

446
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,490
因為太喜歡圣朱尼佩洛而選擇離世
just because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

447
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,730
總之約克夏的家人
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

448
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,730
他們很虔誠
they're big-time religious,

449
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,010
他們不愿意簽字
and they will not sign.

450
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,040
但配偶的決定有更大的優先級
But a spouse can override them.

451
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,850
-所以你們要結婚  -沒錯
- Hence the wedding bells. - You got it.

452
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,550
我們叫了牧師明天上午來
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

453
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,310
她已安排好明天下午就離世
and then she's scheduled to pass tomorrow afternoon.

454
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,940
"安排好離世"  就直說死吧
"Scheduled to pass." Let's just call it dying.

455
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,650
如果你可以這么說的話
If you can call it dying.

456
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,250
上傳到云端  聽著像天堂似的
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

457
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,010
也許吧
I guess.

458
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,630
你會穿西裝嗎
You gonna wear a suit?

459
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,660
婚禮是在我休息時舉行
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

460
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,770
我沒結過  所以就想著
I never married so I just figured,

461
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,630
會有什么損害呢
you know, what's the harm?

462
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,880
你是個好人
You're a good man.

463
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,760
舉手之勞  對吧
It's the least I could do, right?

464
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,950
你現在能幫我們接入系統嗎
Think you could hook us up to the system now?

465
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,450
就一會兒  在她離世之前
Just for a little while, before she passes?

466
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,220
你之后還是能見到她的
You can still see her afterwards.

467
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,190
到時她就不受限了
I mean, then she's no limit.

468
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,100
她將成為圣朱尼佩洛的永久居民
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

469
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,230
我知道  但拜托你了
I know, but can you?

470
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,130
說真的  這里很嚴格  他們隨時監控
Seriously, it is so tight here that they monitor every--

471
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,340
我就只要一會兒
I only want a moment.

472
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,030
女士
Ma'am.

473
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,980
-五分鐘  -謝謝
- You got five minutes - Thank you.

474
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,240
我還從沒白天來過
I've never been here during the daylight.

475
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,690
很暖和
It's warm.

476
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,060
我長話短說  我跟格雷格聊過了
Listen, I gotta be quick. So I spoke to Greg.

477
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,520
-你明天就要離世了  -是的
- You're passing over tomorrow? - Yeah.

478
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,140
婚禮幾小時后
Couple of hours after the wedding.

479
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,600
嚴格上說  我要永遠在這兒度蜜月了
So I guess I am technically honeymooning here forever.

480
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,480
對不起我沒告訴你
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

481
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,590
-我要說點瘋狂的話  -好吧
- I'm gonna say something crazy. - Okay.

482
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,180
你愿和我結婚嗎
Wanna marry me instead?

483
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,080
格雷格看起來人不錯  但是
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

484
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,620
為什么不和與你心靈相通的人結婚呢
Why not someone you've connected with?

485
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,210
這是答應了嗎
Is that a yes?

486
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,840
成為你的合法妻子
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

487
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,000
相互擁有  相互扶持
to have and to hold,

488
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,060
無論疾病還是健康
in sickness and in health,

489
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,900
無論順境還是逆境
in good times and in woe,

490
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,700
富裕還是貧窮
for richer, for poorer...

491
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,260
{\an8}所有系統暫停

492
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,020
抓穩
Hold tight.

493
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,820
好了
There you go.

494
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,410
快到了
Nearly there.

495
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,810
好的
That's it.

496
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,670
你確定自己沒事嗎
Are you sure you're all right?

497
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,710
你都不為我打扮好嗎
You didn't dress up to see me?

498
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,500
拜托
Come on!

499
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,750
這樣呢
Better?

500
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,000
看起來好真實
Looks so real.

501
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,980
感覺好真實
It feels so real!

502
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,130
-你在干什么  -我愛這里
- What are you doing? - Oh, I love it here!

503
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,380
好愛這里
I just love it.

504
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,680
-你以前也來過啊  -但現在我住在這里了
- You've been here before. - But now I live here!

505
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,390
和我待在一起吧
Be with me.

506
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,540
-我們現在就在一起  -我不是這個意思
- I'm with you now. - That's not what I mean.

507
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,790
離世
Pass over.

508
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,490
-你什么時候到日子  -約克夏
- When it's your time. - Yorkie.

509
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,140
-和我留在這里  -我們就不能享受今晚嗎
- Stay here with me. - Can we just enjoy tonight?

510
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,770
快到午夜了
It's almost midnight.

511
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,300
十分鐘后  你就離開這里了
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

512
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,920
我要等一周才能再次見到你
Then I gotta wait a week to see you again.

513
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,100
你知道我只是個游客
You know I'm just a visitor.

514
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,850
再過幾個月  然后呢
What, a couple of months, then what?

515
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,900
-我們現在不討論這個  -然后你就死了
- We're not discussing this. - Then you're gone.

516
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,940
就離開了
Just gone.

517
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,020
-你可以擁有永恒的  -永恒
- You could have forever. - Forever?

518
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,940
永恒是什么意思啊
Who can even make sense of forever?

519
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,300
你想多久就多久
However long you want then.

520
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,580
你也可以輕易抹除自己
I mean, you can remove yourself like that.

521
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,990
這里不是個籠子
It's not a trap.

522
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,220
看看這一切
I mean, look at it!

523
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,630
老天  摸摸這個
Jesus! Touch it!

524
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,530
我要走了
I'm going.

525
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,480
這是真的
It's real.

526
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,040
這些都是真的
This is real.

527
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,000
還有這個
And this.

528
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
拜托  你知道這只是個動作
Come on. You know that was just a gesture.

529
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,760
-你娶了我  -為了幫你離世
- You married me. - To help you pass over.

530
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,010
-是出于好意  -離開就不那么好了
- As a... kindness. - It's not so kind to leave.

531
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,980
好吧  聽著  對不起  我只是
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

532
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,000
我有這個機會
I got this chance.

533
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,510
我們有這個機會  我想和你分享
We got this chance. I wanna share it with you.

534
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,910
我說了我已經決定了
I said I made my choice.

535
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,260
為什么  因為你丈夫不在這里所以你很愧疚
What is it? You feel bad because your husband isn't here?

536
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,310
-因為那是他的選擇  -不要這樣
- Because that was his choice. - Don't.

537
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,970
他選擇不留在這里  就像他離開了你
He chose not to stay here. It's like he left you.

538
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,320
他本來可以留下  但他選擇離開你
You know, he could have stayed, but he chose to leave you.

539
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
你根本不知道自己在說什么
You don't know what you're saying.

540
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,720
你應該感覺生氣
You should be mad at him.

541
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,140
-而不是用愧疚懲罰自己  -放手
- Not whipping yourself with guilt. - Get off me.

542
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,090
你不明白  但他做的事實際上很自私
You can't see it! But what he did, it was selfish actually!

543
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,110
49年
Forty-nine years...

544
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,300
我和他在一起49年
I was with him for 49 years.

545
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,160
你根本無從想象
You can't begin to imagine.

546
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,640
你根本不懂
You can't know...

547
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,160
我們的羈絆  承諾  厭倦
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

548
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,640
渴望  歡樂  以及愛情
the yearning, the laughter, the love of it.

549
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,860
該死的愛情  你根本不懂
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

550
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,200
我們犧牲的一切
Everything we sacrificed.

551
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,140
我給予他的那些歲月  他給予我的那些歲月
The years I gave him. The years he gave me.

552
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,970
你想過問我嗎
Did you think to ask?

553
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,460
你有想過問我嗎
Did it occur to you to ask?

554
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,730
我們有個女兒
We had a daughter.

555
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,060
艾莉森
Alison.

556
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,690
一直很難搞  一直很美好
Always difficult, always beautiful.

557
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,900
39歲時死了  上帝保佑她
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

558
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,010
理查德和我  我們都心如刀割
And Richard and I, we felt that heartbreak as one.

559
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,520
你以為只有自己飽嘗痛苦嗎  去你媽的
You think you're the only person ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

560
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,740
-我不知道  -你也沒想知道
- Well, I didn't know-- - Didn't think to.

561
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,560
理查德要死的時候  他說
You know, when he was dying, richard said to me

562
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,370
他們給他提供這個機會  離世  來這里
when they offered him this, to pass over, pass through,

563
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,160
在這個你熱愛的墓地里永生
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard you're so in love with,

564
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,800
他說  "我怎么能
he said, "How can I?

565
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,160
她錯過了機會  我怎么能"
When she missed out, how can I?"

566
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,070
所以他直接走了
And so he went.

567
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,740
我希望自己能相信他現在和女兒在一起
And I wish I could believe he's with her now,

568
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,660
父女團聚  但我做不到
that they're together, but I don't.

569
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,630
我認為他們哪都不在  就像你說的
I believe they're nowhere. Just like you said.

570
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,900
沒了  不  我是可憐你
Gone. No, I pitied you,

571
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,020
這就是真相  我可憐你
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

572
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,370
現在你想向我推銷
Now you give me some sales pitch

573
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,460
這種永恒有多他媽美好
about how fucking peachy forever could be.

574
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,210
對不起
I'm sorry.

575
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,970
你想在沒有意義的地方永生嗎
You wanna spend forever somewhere nothing matters?

576
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,430
最后像韋斯那樣
End up like Wes?

577
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,990
像那些在泥潭放縱的傻逼
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

578
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:41,370
拼盡全力想要感受到什么  那就去吧
trying anything to feel something, go ahead.

579
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,730
但我要退出了  我走了
But I'm out. I'm gone.

580
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,420
凱莉  對不起
Kelly, I'm sorry.

581
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,800
凱莉
Kelly!

582
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,100
{\an8}前方封路

583
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,590
凱莉
Hey, Kelly.

584
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,100
-你還好嗎  -我沒事
- You all right? - Yeah, I am fine.

585
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,240
那好吧
Well, okay then.

586
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,110
凱莉
Kelly?

587
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,270
總得說來
All things considered...

588
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,930
我想我準備好了
I guess I'm ready.

589
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,400
準備好什么
For what?

590
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,440
面對剩下的一切
For the rest of it.
