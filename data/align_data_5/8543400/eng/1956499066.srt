I went to my friend's birthday

and her dad came, and he said

234

all these "I'm so proud of you"
things to her.

say those things to me.

I was shocked to realize
how much I missed him.

At least I had his golf socks.

if you look ugly?

road and do your job silently?

you need from her, Officer?

But Peter had so much
fatherly concern for me

to assuage his fears.

the sign that I'm scared, okay?

I let Peter buy me cotton

- Papa!
- Uh, let's go look at the monkeys over there.

from that toddler?

for me to be here.

Let him keep it. He can have it.
No problem.

353
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,050
- LESLIE: Uh...
- Right?

354
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,359
Right?

355
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,449
Right. Uh, yeah, of course.

356
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:23,928
[chuckles]:
It's for you.

357
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,582
- Say thank you.
- Thank you. -PETER: Oh... listen,

358
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,976
I-I need to get going
back to work now.

359
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,022
Okay, well, say goodbye
to Grandpa, Jonathan.

360
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,068
- Bye-bye, Grandpa.
- Boof.

361
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,722
Okay, I'll see you soon,
Jonathan?

362
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,506
LESLIE: Am I still
seeing you next Saturday

363
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,640
for brunch, or...
will you be working?

364
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,207
Oh, I'll see you then.

365
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,297
- All righty.
- Bye-bye, buddy.

366
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,559
- JONATHAN: Bye.
- PETER: Goodbye.

367
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,604
JONATHAN:
I want to go see the alligator.

368
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,606
LESLIE: Alligator?
There is no alligator here.

369
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,000
- [laughter]
- WOMAN: Keep up. Keep going.

370
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,611
I loved everything about that.

371
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,527
Really?

372
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,181
'Cause I-I thought you might...

373
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:02,576
I thought you might not
like the grandpa part.

374
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,752
Are you kidding?
I loved that part.

375
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,623
I loved all of it.

376
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,973
Except for giving
my sea lion away.

377
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,975
I mean, I already named him
Mr. Sea Lion.

378
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,195
- [chuckles]
- I'm sorry.

379
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,591
[both laugh]

380
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,599
Oh, man.

381
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,122
That's beautiful.

382
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,906
- It's a nice color.
- Come on.

383
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,866
[bells chime]

384
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,393
- It's chic, right?
- You need a good coat.

385
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,395
You'll catch cold
in that thing you wear.

386
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:42,485
- I could live in this.
- Do you want it?

387
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,143
[whispers]:
It's $395.

388
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,623
But do you want it?

389
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,630
I can't believe this is mine.

390
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,675
I love it so much.

391
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,851
- You know what? Do me a favor.
- What?

392
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,679
- Here, come here.
- Yeah?

393
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,290
Just... [sighs]
Humor me.

394
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,161
Let's put the hood up.

395
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,382
Oh, my God.

396
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,166
You're adorable.

397
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,649
What the fuck are you doing?!

398
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,520
What? You're mad?

399
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,609
- What was that?
- It was a kiss.

400
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:20,871
I thought we were
going somewhere.

401
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,090
I thought you liked me.

402
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,353
- No, not in that way.
- Really?

403
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,921
- I mean, I'm surprised at...
- You're, like, 30 years older than me.

404
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,357
Are you gonna hold my age
against me?

405
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,533
You've been coming on to me
for weeks now, Madeline.

406
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,448
- Me coming on to you?
- Yeah.

407
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,145
I've been doing but nothing
but telling you!

408
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:37,236
Telling me what?
What have you told me? What?

409
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,500
Telling you with-with-with
signs and-and words

410
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,936
that-that wouldn't
hurt your feelings

411
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,633
that I'm not into you that way.

412
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,766
What were you thinking?

413
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,203
Can you calm down
and just not act...

414
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,771
act like you're not at least
partly responsible for this?

415
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,990
- Laying on the bed with me?
- That was snuggling.

416
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,557
Oh, is that what you call it?

417
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,385
Because your breasts
were pushed up against me,

418
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,169
- and don't say they weren't.
- Oh, my God.

419
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,649
That wasn't intentional!

420
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,695
What am I supposed to do
with them? They're out front.

421
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,174
It doesn't mean anything.

422
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,351
What kind of snuggling
was it, then?

423
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,139
The... the dad kind.

424
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,793
The dad kind?

425
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,664
So I'm your dad?

426
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,755
We... we talked about this.

427
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,846
You need to grow up.
This is unhealthy.

428
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,588
Oh, and fucking somebody
40 years younger is?

429
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,721
40? Where'd you come up with 40?

430
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,592
This is a lot of hostility
coming from someone

431
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,768
who let me just buy her
a fancy coat.

432
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,121
There it is.

433
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,950
I can't believe you would
reduce our relationship

434
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,083
to a cold calculation.

435
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,651
What is this? Coat for sex?

436
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,609
Are you serious?

437
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:49,177
This was a transaction?

438
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,616
- Wait, what are you doing? Now, don't put...
- No, I just...

439
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,749
- Take it. Take it. Here, take it.
- No, just...

440
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,326
I'm sorry. I should...
I shouldn't have said that.

441
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,851
I want you to have the coat.

442
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:15,029
It wasn't a trade.
Of course not.

443
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,987
You're freezing. Put it on.

444
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,946
No, I don't want to touch
that coat ever again.

445
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,077
Just fuck that coat!

446
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,949
Well, then, here, would...

447
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,690
Will you put mine on?

448
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,966
This got out of hand.
I didn't mean what I said.

449
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,229
Okay? I'm just... I...

450
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:46,103
I feel like a fool, okay?

451
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,633
[crying]:
I'm the stupid one.

452
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,419
Of course you weren't gonna

453
00:22:57,463 --> 00:23:00,248
buy me a coat
because you're nice.

454
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,511
Because I need one, because...

455
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:06,080
because you wanted
to take care of me for a bit.

456
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:10,258
I mean, how-how could I think
that that was enough for you?

457
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:16,395
I don't know, Madeline.
Is it enough...

458
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,093
for most men,
in your experience?

459
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,750
I don't know.

460
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:29,059
I... I don't have
any experience with men.

461
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,500
But I don't know
what it-it feels like...

462
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,502
to just...

463
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:39,592
have a man look after you
just 'cause.

464
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,751
You were expecting a lot
if you really thought

465
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,449
it was gonna stay platonic.

466
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,887
I mean, what was supposed to be
in it for him?

467
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,935
Me. All of me.

468
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,763
Except for sex.

469
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:23,200
You sure you don't want
to sleep with Grandpa?

470
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,290
I'm not attracted to him.

471
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,206
Come on, Tami. I mean, you're
the one that said it was creepy.

472
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,861
It is creepy, but who cares?

473
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,907
You gotta take the bad
with the good.

474
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,474
And also,
the pilot light is out,

475
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,953
and we need someone to fix it.

476
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,567
Don't you think you could
give him another chance?

477
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,097
MADDY: I closed my eyes
and tried to feel good

478
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,055
about sex with the genius.

479
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,927
I really tried.

480
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,625
- [panting] - Does that feel good?
Do you like that?

481
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,453
- You're so hot. You're like...
- [shushing]

482
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,760
- Don't say anything, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,066
But I couldn't
envision myself with him.

484
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,634
I just wasn't attracted
to him that way.

485
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:17,559
I decided I had to let go
of the genius entirely.

486
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:20,562
[quiet chatter]

487
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,525
Madeline?

488
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,397
Yeah?

489
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,141
Uh... can I talk to you
for a minute outside?

490
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,447
- MADDY: What's up?
- PETER: I have something

491
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,537
important that I want
to say to you.

492
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,800
Oh, my God. I'm fired.

493
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,410
- What?
- I'm fired. Y-You're getting me fired.

494
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,673
- No, hold on. Hold on a second.
- Am I right? Am I right?

495
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:47,850
- No, look. Just...
- B-Because usually that's... that's what happens.

496
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,330
- Will you just...
- I've disturbed you,

497
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,288
so you're gonna find a way
to remove me

498
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,681
from your field of vision,

499
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,683
and I'll get a bad
performance review,

500
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,207
and they'll find out that
I've been photocopying a lot,

501
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,079
- and-and they'll fire me.
- Look. Look. Look.

502
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:01,081
None of that's gonna happen.

503
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,042
- Really?
- Really.

504
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,742
We both did this.

505
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,961
I would never
blame it all on you.

506
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,398
I would never try
to get you to leave.

507
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,011
Okay?

508
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:24,365
Look. I wanted a moment with you
because I wanted to...

509
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,716
to tell you...

510
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,372
that I'm leaving.

511
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,330
What?

512
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,637
I'm leaving.

513
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,074
I'm taking a little break away.

514
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,772
What? All of a sudden?

515
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,081
I was able to arrange
a sabbatical.

516
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,128
Is it... is it because of me?

517
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,521
Yes.

518
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,394
I'm sorry. I-I-I never...

519
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,570
No, don't be. Don't. It...

520
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,572
- I never... I never...
- Yeah, I know.

521
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,184
It was eye-opening.

522
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:06,233
[stammering]

523
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,931
[shuddering breaths]

524
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:10,933
Are you crying?

525
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,416
Aren't-aren't you...

526
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,419
Aren't you a little old
to be crying?

527
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,116
Why can't I cry?

528
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,944
Why can't I have emotions
about this?

529
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:23,946
Just 'cause I'm older?

530
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,865
It's bullshit that, you know,

531
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:32,651
older people have...
have it together.

532
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,437
It's... more of the same.

533
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,266
You're just trying
to figure it out.

534
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,754
I really am sorry.

535
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,334
I have something
that I want to say to you,

536
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:07,424
and I want you to really listen
and take it in, Madeline.

537
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,644
Okay.

538
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,691
I want you to know that...

539
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,567
that you're a wonderful girl.

540
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,572
You're smart.

541
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:29,969
Resourceful, beautiful.

542
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:34,190
And you will accomplish
whatever...

543
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,627
whatever you set your heart on.

544
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:40,109
You have grown up to be
an extraordinary young woman.

545
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:46,899
You're the daughter
of any father's dreams.

546
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,076
I am very...

547
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,949
very, very proud of you,
Madeline.

548
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:15,231
MADDY: And in that
moment, something shifted.

549
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,713
Watching the genius walk away
from me, I felt released.

550
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,323
Split open.

551
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,849
His words
had been transformational.

552
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,852
Suddenly,
I was finally grown up.

553
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,855
