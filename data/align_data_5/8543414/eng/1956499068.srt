187

The last time

188
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:46,646
that we were all
together like this

189
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:51,259
was our joint
140th birthday party

190
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,522
when we announced
our engagement.

191
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:59,659
I'm sorry now that we didn't
have a bigger wedding reception,

192
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,878
but I suppose I imagined

193
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,838
we would have
many opportunities.

194
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:08,537
Ken was not so certain of that.

195
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,106
I remember him saying once

196
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,936
that at our age,
"until death do us part"

197
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,199
didn't seem like
such a big commitment.

More realistic maybe.

201
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,557
Um, when Ken and I met,

202
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,430
we had already been through
many ups and downs in life,

203
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:36,347
and we had learned
how to compromise,

204
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,872
and we had survived

205
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,744
loss and mistakes.

206
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,921
And somehow we felt
if this relationship failed,

207
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,358
we would survive this, too.

208
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,712
I'm not so sure
about that anymore.

209
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,498
Old love

210
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,458
is different,
yet it is also the same

211
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,984
because Ken and I did everything

212
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:07,117
that young people do.

213
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,641
We fell in love, we traveled,

214
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,643
we remodeled a house together,

215
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,863
we planted a garden,

216
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,953
I finished a memoir,

217
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,347
he called me "sweetheart."

218
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,219
And on nights when we
were out in company,

219
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,831
all I had to do was glance
across the room,

220
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,572
and he'd intuit that
it was time for him

221
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:31,359
to take me home where we could
sit on the rim of the bathtub

222
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:32,752
and floss our teeth

223
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:37,626
and gossip about the evening.

224
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:42,065
Every time we passed each other
in the house, Ken made a point

225
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,634
of stopping to kiss me
or squeeze my shoulder

226
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,071
or stroke my hand.

227
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,378
I never had that
in my life before,

228
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,249
and sometimes it irked me,

229
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:56,993
but now I think it's the thing
that I will miss the most.

230
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,866
He and I often told each other,

231
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,694
"We are so lucky,"

232
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,393
and we were.

233

Young love,

234
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,792
even for old people,
can be surprisingly bountiful.

235

Many of you know that Ken and
I met when we were running.

236
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,017
The geriatric Olympics,
he called it.

237
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,498
You know, in the beginning,
I chased him

238
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:27,415
and then he chased me,
and finally we found a way

239
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,635
to run in lockstep.

240
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,551
And the tough uphill bits,
the bits with illnesses

241
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,945
and setbacks,

242
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,599
went a little easier,

243
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:41,821
and the pleasant downhill parts
were that much more joyful.

244
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,438
And now Ken has...

245
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,875
run the course.

246

that you're confident enough

to talk to a complete stranger,

I'm just sort of happy

I've just been stood up
by someone

who I really thought
might lead to something.

416
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:20,921
And I don't mind
if it's after a first date

417
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,662
or something, you know,
you meet someone

418
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,926
and they're not for you,
but... without meeting you?

419
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,102

to make an impression.

just said feels like.

428

you should try

429
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,740
