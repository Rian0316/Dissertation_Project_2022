1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,780
That was close.
真悬

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,950
God, I love the smell of
paintballs in the morning.
神呐 我爱死早上的彩弹味儿了

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,330
Yeah, still funny, Raj.
是啊 不过还是很滑稽 Raj

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,730
There's no way we can get to the ridge.
我们根本没法到山脊上去

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,880
The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.
化学部的家伙彻底断了我们的路

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,360
But what about the creek bed?
那河床那边呢?

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,570
The Pharmacology Department controls that, and
they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.
药理学部的家伙控制着呢
别忘了他们都吃了实验用的类固醇

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,980
That's it then. We're doomed.
那可好了 我们完了

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,330
I think the time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price for some of us
我觉得现在是该遭报应的时候了

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,920
failing to attend my Physics
Department paintball strategy meeting.
我们中的某些人可是没有
参加物理部的彩弹策略会议

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,620
I told you my mom has spider veins.
都跟你说了我妈得了蜘蛛静脉

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,050
I had to take her to the laser clinic.
我得带她去医院照激光

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,640
And I told you I wante
to see a doctor's note.
我也跟你说了让你把病例卡给我

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,510
We need a plan.
我们得拟定个计划

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,250
How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
执行"上帝之锤"计划如何?

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,830
I forget. Which one
is Hammer of the Gods?
我都忘了 哪个是"上帝之锤"?

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking
lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
我们躲在停车场的垃圾堆旁
伏击那些来尿尿的家伙

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,040
No go. The Dumpsters are deep in
Astronomy Department territory.
不行 垃圾堆在天文部的大后方

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,000
That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.
那不成问题 白天金星不正亮着呢

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,530
They're probably just
all staring at the sky.
他们可能都在仰望天空呢

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,380
All right, what we need
now is a tactical retreat.
好吧 我们要来一次战术性撤退

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,670
Did you see the episode of Stargate
where they found themselves on a planet
你看过那集星际之门么?
他们发现自己正身处于一个

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,370
with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?
基于地球上的雅典和斯巴达
文明的行星之上

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,980
Not important.
那不重要

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,600
Leonard, Raj and I are going to
burst out the door and run away.
Leonard Raj 还有我一起冲出门去

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,160
Howard will cover us.
Howard来掩护我们

27
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,040
Why don't I run away and you cover me?
为什么不是我冲出去你们来掩护我?

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,290
Because you chose your
mother's veins over victory.
因为在胜利和你妈的蜘蛛静脉之间
你选择了后者

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,160
On three. One, two, three, go!
数到三 一 二 三 出发!

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,430
I had to take her! It's
almost bathing suit weather!
我没法不带她去! 夏天都快到了!

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,970
I surrender! Don't
shoot! They went that way!
我投降! 别开枪! 他们往那边跑了!

32
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,750
Howard, I'm on your team.
Howard 我是你队友

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,220
Oh, Leslie, thank God.
噢 Leslie 谢天谢地

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,450
Where's the rest of your squad?
你们队的其他人呢?

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,630
Ah, they left me here to die.
啊 他们丢下我一个人在这儿等死

36
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,130
What about yours?
你们队呢?

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,960
Dead, all of them.
都死了

38
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,130
Sorry.
抱歉

39
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,710
Don't be. It was friendly fire.
不必 都是我干的

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,300
They just wouldn't listen.
他们就是不听

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,110
Well, we're surrounded, so I
guess there's nothing for us to do
好吧 我们被包围了
我想除了在这儿等着被俘被杀

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,270
but wait to be captured or killed.
没什么其他事能干了

43
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,330
Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.
哼 等待是最不好玩的了

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,410
All the while knowing that there's a
paint pellet out there with your namen it.
一直想着外头有颗写着
自己名字的彩弹在等着

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,990
Yeah, the big wet ball of death.
没错 又大又湿 宣告你的死期

46
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,930
Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?
倒是更能体会生的感觉 不是吗?

47
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,570
It kind of does.
确实有点

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,330
I say we make every moment count.
我说 我们不能虚度光阴

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,000
I agree.
同意

50
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,470
How exactly do we do that?
我们究竟该怎么做?

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,170
Howard, why aren't you covering us?
We're getting slaughtered out here!
Howard 你为啥不掩护我们?
我们被人屠杀了!

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,630
War is hell.
活受罪的战争

53
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:04,430

Did you guys see the new budget
memo that went out this morning?
你们看见今晨出的预算备忘录了么?

57
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,160
Yeah, more cutbacks.
嗯 又削减了不少

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,410
Unacceptable.It baffles me why
they don't simply let some of you go
无法接受 我就想不通了
干嘛不干脆让你们中的某些人滚蛋

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,040
so that there's money
available for my research.
这样我的研究经费就有保障了

60
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,460
You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
你知道我想不通啥么 Sheldon?

61
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,140
Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.
基于你的学术记录
你想不通的事多了去了

62
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,880
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.
- 嘿 你们好
- 嘿 Leslie

63
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,810
Howard, I got the approval for
the rapid prototyper you wanted.
Howard 你要的快速原型机
我替你批下来了

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,920
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.
真是太好了 Leslie 多谢

65
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,090
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
你替我抓背 我当然要还你了

66
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,790
What was all that about?
那是怎么回事?

67
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,530
Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie
control of some unrestricted grant money.
噢 没什么 他们让Leslie掌管
一些非限制性基金

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back
- scratching and the meow!
那是没错 不过抓背还有"喵"是怎么回事!

69
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,190
I believe the back-scratching metaphor
generally describes a quid p quo situation
我想那个"抓背"的比喻
主要说的是相互报答

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,120
where one party provides goods or services to the
second party in compensation for a similar action.
一方提供货物或服务
另一方给予类似的回馈

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,410
Thank you.
谢谢侬

72
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,140
The meow, that sounded to
me like an African civet cat.
而那个"喵" 听上去像是种非洲灵猫

73
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,520
Are you done?
说完了没?

74
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,140
No.
还没

75
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,480
Despite what the name suggests,
the civet cat is not a true cat.
虽然名字里有个猫字
但灵猫并不是一种猫

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,220
Now I'm done.
这下说完了

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,570
You know what I'm thinking?
你知道我在想什么吗?

78
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,230
I'm thinking Howard wasn't
making a back-scratching metaphor.
我在想Howard的"抓背"并非是个比喻

79
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,270
I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.
我想应该真的有抓才是

80
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,290
What about it, Howard?
你说呢 Howard?

81
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,940
Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I know you and Leslie have a little history.
好吧 我什么都不想说
因为你和Leslie有过那么一小段

82
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
I don't care about that.
这我倒是不在乎

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,590
Great, 'cause I've been
dying to say something.
太好了 我都快憋死了

84
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,160
You and Leslie?
你和Leslie?

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,240
In the paintball shed! Twice!
在彩弹小棚里! 还两次呢!

86
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,400
Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?
这就是你没有掩护我们出逃
让我们任人宰割的原因?

87
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
噢 没错 真是抱歉

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,450
My good man, dereliction of duty in the
face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
我的老兄 在敌人面前玩忽职守
可是要被送上军事法庭的

89
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,180
Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle
is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.
军事法庭也好 笨蛋法庭也罢
Leslie Winkle是我上的第五个女人

90
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,660
I mean, for free.
我是说 不要钱的那种

91
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,760
And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.
别忘了 你还得到了快速原型机

92
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,800
That's an expensive
piece of equipment, dude.
老兄 那玩意儿可不便宜

93
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.
而我们的预算经费被剥削了

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,790
Okay, one way to look at this is
that I'm getting new equipment,
看起来好像是我得到了新的仪器

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,720
and you're not, and that's unfair.
而你们没有 这很不公平

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,540
But a better way to look at this is that I'm
getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.
但你们换个角度看看就是
我和别人上床而你们没有 多高兴

97
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,790
The whole thing froze. I
don't know what happened.
不知道怎么搞的 完全死机了

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,970
Calm down. We'll figure it out.
冷静点 会有办法的

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,860
How can I calm down? I'm gonna
lose my whole shopping cart.
我要怎么冷静?
我购物车里的所有东西都没了

100
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,610
That's three hours of picking
out shoes just shot to hell.
我花了三个小时选的鞋子就这么没了

101
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,980
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.
- 你好 Penny
- 你好 Sheldon

102
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,400
You're in my spot.
你占了我的座

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,470
Are you planning on sitting here?
你打算坐在这儿?

104
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,640
No, I'm going to the comic book store.
没有 我打算去漫画书店

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,030
Then what difference does it make?
那我坐这儿怎么了?

106
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,120
- What difference does it make?
- Here we go.
- 你坐这儿怎么了?
- 又来了

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,030
That is my spot.
那是我的座

108
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,550
In an ever-changing world, it
is a single point of consistency.
在这个不断变化的世界中
那是唯一一个连续点

109
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,960
If my life were expressed as a function on a
four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,
如果将我的人生比作
四维笛卡尔坐标系里的一个函数

110
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,530
that spot at the moment I first sat
on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
在我第一次坐上那儿的时候
那个座的坐标就是(0,0,0,0)

111
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,700
What?
啥意思?

112
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,880
Don't sit in his spot.
别坐他的地儿

113
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,360
Fine. Happy?
好吧 开心了?

114
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm not unhappy.
我没不开心呀

115
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,760
Boy, I love him, but he
is one serious waadoodle.
我爱他 但他实在怪里怪气

116
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,740
Okay, that should do it.
好了 应该成了

117
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,410
Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
哦 谢谢 救了我的命

118
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,110
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.
你还真定了不少鞋啊

119
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah, you know the sad
thing is, it's really not.
可悲的是啥知道不 这根本不算多

120
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,320
Ooh, is thisne of those paintball guns?
哦 这就是那彩弹枪?

121
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,290
Yeah. You ought to come
out with us sometime.
是啊 找时间一起来玩呗

122
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,350
Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.
哦 不 谢了 我是内布拉斯加州人

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,710
When we shoot things, it's because we want to
eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.
我们开枪 要么是要吃那玩意
要么就是让她们离我们男友远点

124
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,810
Boy, your heart's racing. I
must've really gotten you going.
哦 你心跳很快啊 我还真有两下子呢

125
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,890
Well, it's partly you, partly
my transient idiopaic arrhythmia.
你只是一部分原因
我有短暂自发性心律不齐

126
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,520
Sexy.
性感呦

127
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,640
Can I assume that you likewise
found the experience...
我可不可以说你也觉得这过程...

128
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,010
Satisfactory?
很满足?

129
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,930
That wasn't quite the word I was looking
for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.
我不是想用这个词
不过是的 过与不过来衡量蛮好

130
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,010
Hey, are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?
嘿 那原型机用着还不错吧?

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Oh, it's great.
哦 好极了

132
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,190
Everybody in the Engineering
Department is eating their hearts out.
工程部的人眼馋得
哈喇子都快流出来了

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,090
Isn't it nice when your good
fortune makes others miserable?
你这么好命让别人惨兮兮的
感觉不错吧?

134
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,420
You know, most people don't get that.
要知道 有些人想不通

135
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,510
Howard, I'm home!
Howard 我回来了!

136
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,960
Oh, great.
这下好了

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,610
Book club was cancelled!
读书会取消了!

138
