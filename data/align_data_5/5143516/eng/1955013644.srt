    New<i> Star Wars</i> in three days!

30
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,233
             Hey, Thursday can't
           get here soon enough.

31
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,902
      I'm taking off work
 to watch the original trilogy

00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:21,206
 while I eat enough<i> Star Wars </i>
   cereal to choke a Wookiee.

33
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,810
  Uh, sweetie, you do realize
  Thursday is Amy's birthday.

34
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,412
       And you do realize
       I bought my ticket

35
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,114
 when Amy and I were broken up?

36
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,818

You guys just got back together.

       You might not want
 to ditch her on her birthday.

40
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,993
   I think Penny has a point.
  You can see it another day.

41
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,995
       But someone might
        spoil the movie.

42
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,230
        No one can spoil
     Amy's birthday for me.

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,465
  Surprise! She's even older.

44
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,700
      Who saw that coming?

45
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,569
        Oh, that's nice.

46
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,971

00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,617
     Oh, great. This again.

49
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,421
 Arthur, what brings you back?

50
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,590
   Uh, beats me. I-I just...

51
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,126
 hope this isn't a-a sex dream.

52
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,930
 In the past, you've come to me

53
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,831
      when I'm struggling
        with a dilemma.

54
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,935
 And-and the one time where...
     where you were afraid,

55
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:27,206
    and you needed me for...
       for a night light.

56
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,809
  What's-what's troubling you?

57
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,412
            Well...

58
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,214
   my friends are telling me

59
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,749
      I shouldn't abandon
 my girlfriend on her birthday

60
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,586
to see the new<i> Star Wars</i> movie.

61
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,955
      Well, sounds right.

62
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,959
Can... can I get out of this...

63
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,661
          muumuu now?

64
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,763
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

65
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,733
     the guardians of peace
   and justice in the galaxy.

66
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,904
And they... they-they don't wear
           underwear.

67
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,978
 So, you agree with my friends

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,380
that I should skip the premiere?

69
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:12,050
Uh, do... do you
love this girl?

70
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,885
                            Yes.

71
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:17,089
     But she knows how important
            <i> Star Wars</i> is to me.

72
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,524
          Well, maybe
   you should show her how...

73
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,194
  how important<i> she</i> is to you.

74
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:27,132
             By seeing the movie
           she'd want me to see?

75
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:31,203
    Sheldon, you-you can see
 this movie whenever you want.

76
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,673
       But you only have
    a limited number of days

77
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,776
      that you-you can be
        with this woman.

78
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,678
          Be with her.

79
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,448
                   You're right.

80
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,017
             Great.

81
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,719
            Where are you going?

82
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:52,824
  I don't know, but hopefully,
  somewhere I can wear pants.

83
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,663
 (cell phone ringtone playing)

84
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,769
     Sheldon, what's wrong?

85
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:07,439
I wanted to let you know I'll be
spending your birthday with you.

86
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,475
             Okay.

87
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,845
  See, I-I had tickets to the
<i> Star Wars</i> premiere that night,

88
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,248
but Professor Proton came to me
     in a dream dressed as

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,318
Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me
     I should be with you.

90
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,120
           Obi-what?

91
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,990
   I'll-I'll let you get back
   to sleep now. Good night.

92
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,591
    Okay. Good night. Wait.

93
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,060
          Um, Sheldon,

94
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,929
  were you actually<i> not</i> gonna
   spend my birthday with me?

95
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,434
   It's late. Got to go. Bye.

96
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,003
   Good for Sheldon deciding

97
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,272
        to stay with Amy
        on her birthday.
                         I know.

98
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,174
   It's still gonna be weird
 to see the movie without him.

99
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,211
Well, we could wait a
couple days and see it together.

100
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,348
        (loud laughter)

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,450
             Hello.

102
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,518
 Hey. We're going to the comic
 book store. You want to come?

103
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
          No, I can't.

104
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,189
  I need to make preparations
      for Amy's birthday.

105
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,156
                  Which leads me

106
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,392
      to the following bit
          of business.

107
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,427
This is my ticket to<i> Star Wars.</i>

108
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,063
    I don't have to tell you
      it is worth far more

109
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,567
      than its face value
           of $15.50.

110
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,503
     I trust you'll give it
       to someone worthy.

111
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,771
          You got it.

112
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,306
       Well, Penny might
        want to join us.

113
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,843
               This is my ticket
                   to<i> Star Wars.</i>

114
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,345
           (knocking)
                        SHELDON:
                          Penny.

115
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,480
                          Penny?
           (knocking)

116
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,647
           (knocking)
                          Penny?

117
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,783
                 What happens if
               I say, "Come in"?

118
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,518
        Well, find out.

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,853
                        Come in!

120
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,158
           (knocking)
          Bernadette?

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,227
           (knocking)
                     Bernadette?
                     Bernadette?

122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,496
Come in!

123
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,498
            SHELDON:
          Keep it up.

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,533
   I got nowhere else to be.

125
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,469
                   Just come in.

126
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,072
     For future reference,
 if I want to watch<i> Mean Girls,</i>

127
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,674
   I'll stream it on Netflix.

128
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,777
We're sorry.
What do you need?

129
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,078
              Well, as you know,

130
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,046
             I'll be celebrating
        Amy's birthday with her,

131
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,314
and I could use your assistance

132
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,216
      in helping me select
       the perfect gift.

133
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,785
                           Sure.
                   Well, so far,

134
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,119
 I've come up with three ideas.

135
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,821
 The first is a chance for her

136
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,723
        to play the harp
  with the L.A. Philharmonic.

137
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,324
      Wow. You can really
         arrange that?

138
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,959
     Well, I said a chance,
           you know.

139
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,294
       When you tell them
       it's your birthday

140
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,562
         at Bennigan's,
       they make a fuss.

141
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,865
I don't see why the Philharmonic
    would be any different.

142
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,234
How about something
a little more realistic?

143
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,670
                Well, Amy enjoys
      knitting her own sweaters,

144
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,573
so I was thinking of getting her
    an all-expense-paid trip

145
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,443
     to the Wisconsin Sheep
       and Wool Festival.

146
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,982
      Sorry. I was waiting
        for the bazinga.

147
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,584
 Hold on. It could be romantic.

148
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,985
 The two of them away together,

149
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,855
         keeping each other warm
             in snowy Wisconsin.

150
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,290
        No, no, no, no.
     She'd be going alone.

151
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,958
       Well, if you think
      I'm afraid of birds,

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,259
you should see me around sheep.

153
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,595
          Okay, well,
    what's the third option?

154
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,996
  That I have coitus with her.

155
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,298
   (glass shatters on floor)

156
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,441
 What do you think about giving
  Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

157
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,709
         I don't know.

158
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,278
   Have you ever seen a movie
      with Stuart before?

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,881
        It's like going
       with your grandpa.

160
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,182
   Instead of eating popcorn,

161
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,585
    he brings little pieces
    of chicken in Tupperware

162
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,887
  and a thermos full of soup.

163
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,922
       He's not that bad.

164
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,825
Hey, Stuart, got any plans
Thursday night?

165
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,561
 My, uh... my doctor's worried
     about my circulation,

166
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,631
    so I was thinking about
    walking around the mall.

167
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,166
                    Why?

168
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,301
Well...
            Hey, you guys.

169
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,070
Oh, make sure
to wear sensible shoes.

170
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,372
        Wil, want to go
     to<i> Star Wars</i> Thursday?

171
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,507
Absolutely.

172
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,041
                 Fine, take Wil.

173
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,210
      See if<i> he</i> brings you
         clam chowder.

174
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,114
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

175
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,149
Let's-let's... let's just
recap our options.

176
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,419
      All right, we've got
   harp thing, sheep thing...

177
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,121
Wild thang.

178
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,592
              Which do you think
                   she'd prefer?

179
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,396
  Because I checked the Sheep
  and Wool Festival Web site,

180
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,999
        and there's only
      8,000 tickets left.

181
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,737
    Sheldon, being physical with
     Amy is a huge step for you.

182
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,505
Yeah, are you ready
for this?

183
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,708
      Intimacy in any form
  has been challenging for me,

184
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,444
    but I'd like to show her
     how important she is,

185
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,347
       and it feels like
  now might be the right time.

186
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,082
                 Sheldon, that's
                   so beautiful.

187
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,018
       Then it's settled.

188
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,554
     Amy's birthday present
      will be my genitals.

189
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,562
   Thanks for taking me out.

190
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,797
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

191
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,965
Why not celebrate early?

192
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,567
                     So where do
                 you want to go?

193
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,236
I heard that new Mexican place
on Green Street is good.

194
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:35,507
         Sure, sure. Or we could
   take you to get a bikini wax.

195
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,512
        Why would I get a bikini
            wax for my birthday?

196
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,381
Uh, I don't know.
It was just a thought.

197
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,417
       I think I'll just
       stick to Mexican.

198
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,554
    Great. And then maybe after,
     we can watch a dirty movie,

199
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,591
and if anybody has any questions
  about what happened or how,

200
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,726
      we can answer them.

201
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,029
                      Okay, what
                    is going on?

202
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,065
Oh, we just want you
to be prepared

203
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,500
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

204
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,603
What surprises?

205
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,404
                        Oh.

206
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,607
                We don't want to
                 spoil anything,

207
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,745
but you should know that Sheldon
 said he's ready to be physical.

208
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,214
   You shut your damn mouth!

209
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,454
You actually heard him say this?

210
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,888
Yes. He said he wants
to do something

211
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,290
to show you how much
you mean to him.

212
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,761
           (exhales)
   I-I can't believe it. I...

213
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,531
   I don't know what to say.

214
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,400
              Well, we're really
                  happy for you,

215
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,168
                 and we know how
                much he cares...

216
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,770
     I do know what to say!
      Let's get me waxed!

217
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,645
           (whirring)

218
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,550
       Why isn't it ever
   Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

219
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,353
          You're back.

220
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:59,457
       It-it doesn't seem
      like it's up to me.

221
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,993
I suppose you're here because...

222
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,296
  I've decided to be physical
      with my girlfriend,

223
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,066
and I've never done that before.

224
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:12,203
   E-Excuse me for a moment.

225
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,278
      (lightsaber humming)

226
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,555
   Well, it was worth a shot.

227
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,360
            So, can you help me?

228
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,962
      Uh, all right. Um...

229
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,399
once-once the man gets

230
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,402
  the-the woman out of her...
     out of her bloomers...

231
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,405
                         Oh, no.
                       Not that.

232
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,974
                  I-I understand
                  the mechanics.

233
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,243
  Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

234
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,980
         I have no idea
  what kids these days are...

235
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,451
   calling their-their parts.

236
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,189
    I think they say "junk."

237
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,359
What is happening to this world?

238
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,665
        What-what do you
     actually need to know?

239
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,602
   This is an important night
            for us,

240
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,405
        and I'm worried
     I might be overwhelmed

241
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,842
      and ruin everything.

242
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:27,679
     Sheldon, if-if you're
     with the right person,

243
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,215
       it-it'll be okay.

244
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,853
       Thank you, Arthur.

245
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,856
You are the wisest of the wise.

246
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,592
 Well, that's-that's very nice
         of you to say,

247
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,228
          but I think
  I'm just an expression of...

248
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,164
   of your unconscious mind.

249
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,867
        Oh, sure. Yeah.

250
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,771
  Well, you're fun to look at.

251
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,909
      Tonight's the night!

252
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,711
                  Yeah, the wait
                is finally over!

253
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:03,047
I know. Then you'll finally stop
       talking about it!

254
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,016
Ready to go?
         Let's do this.

255
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,351
        Have fun, guys!

256
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,153
            We will.
I can't believe
Sheldon gave this up.

257
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,756
              I know.
We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

258
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,227
          (singsongy):
        No, they're not.

259
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,631
    Knowing them, they will.

260
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,934
      (indistinct chatter)

261
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,437
T minus 15 minutes!

262
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,739
Oh, did you hear
from Wil?

263
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,175
          Yeah, he's on his way.
         Time for bladder check.

264
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,676
             Check.

265
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,911
           Check.

266
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,413
          Check. Wait.

267
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,683
   Screw it. I'm holding it.

268
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,951
         (crowd booing)

269
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,786
What is everyone
booing at?

270
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,788
       (booing continues)

271
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,694
     Hey, guys. What's up?

272
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,031
Um, hey, Wil.
What you doin'?

273
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,301
    I was on<i> Star Trek.</i> I'm just
      rooting for the home team.

274
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,136
                            MAN:
              <i> Star Trek</i> stinks!

275
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,372
                 Yeah? Live long
                    and suck it!

276
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,844
    (romantic music playing)

277
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,014
                      (knocking)
                        SHELDON:
                  Birthday girl.

278
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,218
                  Birthday girl.
                  Birthday girl.

279
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,222
            Come in!

280
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,858
              Oh!

281
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,097
          Hi, Sheldon.

282
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,498
     Hello. Sorry I'm late.

283
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,033
   I also got you a balloon,

284
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,903
      but it floated away,
  and I chased it for a while.

285
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,405
    That's okay. Come on in.

286
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,673
Thank you.
            Mm-hmm.

287
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,776
  Um, I'll... I'm gonna go put
        these in water.

288
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,311
             Okay.

289
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,014
  Ooh, this is different, hmm?

290
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,849
       Candles and music.

291
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,284
Do you like it?

292
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,453
      It's kind of spooky.

293
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,255
     I can change it back.

294
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,723
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

295
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,493
  As long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

296
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,163
     (panting)

297
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,633
        So...

298
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,236
What'd you have in mind
for tonight?

299
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,972
 I thought I could take you out
   to a nice birthday dinner.

300
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,443
If we pick a place east of here,
   we might find the balloon.

301
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,446
  Um, that sounds nice, but...

302
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,449
I'm not really hungry right now.

303
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,185
       I thought maybe...

304
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,722
  we could do presents first.
                             Oh.

305
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,292
           All right.

306
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,227
             Um...

307
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:33,197
   I should probably tell you
   something about this gift.

308
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,201
     You mean before you...

309
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,405
        (suggestively):
         give it to me?

310
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,709
              Yes.

311
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,579
    May I ask you a question
          before I...

312
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,516
        (suggestively):
        give it to you?

313
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,319
    Of course.
                         Why are
                       we saying

314
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,955
  "give it to you" like that?

315
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,524
            Sheldon,

316
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,794
   I know your present is...

317
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,965
 for us to be intimate tonight.

318
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,267
             I see.

319
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,902
       Is that all right?

320
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,776
           I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

321
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,446
 I'm gonna need verbal consent.

322
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,651
              Yes.

323
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,854
    You know what, let me pull a
quick contract off the Internet.

324
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,262
      So, if you don't like<i> Star</i>
        <i> Wars,</i> why are you here?

325
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,530
        Oh, I'm just having fun.

326
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,065
             Everyone takes<i> Star</i>
             <i> Wars</i> so seriously.

327
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,135
        Like if the movie's bad,
    it's gonna ruin their lives.

328
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,803
Is it bad?
Did you hear something?

329
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,273
     Oh, my God. It's bad.
       Somebody kill me.

330
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,709
                     See? That's
                    what I mean.

331
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,678
         When you wake up in the
        morning, whether this is

332
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,747
         the greatest movie ever
       or a total piece of crap,

333
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,448
                 your life isn't
            gonna change at all.

334
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,318
He's right.

335
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,452
                           Yeah.

336
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,987
    No matter what happens,

337
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,089
   we're coming back tomorrow
       to watch it again.

338
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,161
 Do you think Sheldon's actually
       gonna go through with it?

339
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,229
I don't know.

340
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,698
      He said he's ready.
                    Yeah, but he
                      also swore

341
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
 this was the year he'd be able
      to pull the guts out

342
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,236
         of a pumpkin.

343
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,271
 Well, I'm gonna stay positive.
       I mean, we talked.

344
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,840
  I told him what women like,
 and after he stopped giggling,

345
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,176
     he seemed pretty sure
          of himself.

346
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,757
              Hi.

347
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,759
             Hello.

348
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,064
           So, um...

349
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,000
 should I get under the covers
           with you?

350
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,702
           All right.

351
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,075
                 (clears throat)

352
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,559
Hello.
                             Hi!

353
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,331
Why are you shaking?
Are you cold?

354
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,935
I'm just, um... really nervous.

355
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,269
              Why?

356
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,872
            Well...

357
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,174
   I've been waiting for this
          for so long,

358
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,911
    I've just... built it up
          in my head.

359
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,014
                    I don't know
                 what to expect.

360
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,851
  Neither do I.

361
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:44,589
But... we can find out
together.

362
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,593
                      Okay.

363
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,536
      I'm really nervous.

364
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,771
I know.

365
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,941
   We've been waiting so long
           for this.

366
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:08,079
     And we've built it up
     in our heads so much.

367
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,115
                      Guys, it's
                   just a movie.

368
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,583
                That's true.

369
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,118
He's right.
             It is.

370
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,422
                Although, we all
               remember Jar Jar.

371
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,926
Leonard,
I-I'm scared again.

372
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,636
      Well, I enjoyed that
  more than I thought I would.

373
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,445
                     Me, too.

374
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:46,851
I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

375
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,621
       That works for me.

376
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,125
         I enjoyed that
  more than I thought I would.

377
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,132
            I don't think
        I can walk right now.

378
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,973
ARTHUR:
Uh, Sheldon?

379
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,175
     Sheldon.

380
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,243
            Arthur.

381
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,711
                    What are you
                     doing here?

382
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,712
                 I-I don't think

383
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,248
    I need any more advice.

384
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,984
     I-I was just curious.

385
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,655
        How-How'd it go?

386
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,290
              Oh.

387
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,561
        It was amazing.

388
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,964
  I-I saw it a few days later.

389
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,266
         What a movie.

390
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,273
 But, uh, what-what about Amy?

391
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,276
 Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.

392
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:49,714
But she doesn't have the history
    with the franchise I do.

393
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,150
             Okay.

394
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,053
       Good... good talk.
