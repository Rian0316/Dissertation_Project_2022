《絕命律師》前情回顧
Previously on "Better Call Saul"

31
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,260
你可以接自己的案子
You'd be working on your case.

32
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,270
查克不會同意的
Chuck wouldn't like it.

33
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,450
查克管不著
Chuck has no say in this.

34
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,770
剛剛和你做的這筆生意
This deal he's doing with you,

35
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,150
他是背著同伙做的
he's doing outside his crew.

36
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,840
他可不想被他老大發現
He doesn't want his bosses to know.

37
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,710
我之前有一套棒球卡片的珍藏
I had a baseball card collection--

38
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,450
全沒了
All gone!

39
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,250
你確定他們不是在找其他東西嗎
You're sure they weren't looking for anything else?

40
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,210
如果我們每晚都那樣  不是很好嗎
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?

41
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,180
是啊  但我們不能那樣
Yes, but we can't.

42
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,390
我們本可以每人帶八十萬美金回家  不用交稅
We could have gone home with $800,000, tax free!

43
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,660
你想說什么
Your point being?

44
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,290
我們為什么沒那么干
Why didn't we?

45
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,280
這位是詹姆斯·麥吉爾
James McGill.

46
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,900
這位是克利福德·梅因
Clifford Main.

47
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,100

Just Jimmy.

你來這兒干什么
What're you doing here?

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,570
咱倆有一陣沒見了
Ah, it's been a while.

54
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,810
我覺得我應該過來看看你
Thought I should come in and check on you.

55
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,400
我剛才好像聽到音樂了
Did I hear music?

56
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,270
沒  我剛才在...  我幫你拿吧
No, no. I was just -- ‭let me get that for you.

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,910
-見到你真好  霍華德  -我也很高興
- Good to see you, Howard. - Oh, likewise.

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,430
大家都非常想你  朋友
You are sorely missed, my friend.

59
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,990
別把這當負擔
Don't take that as any undue pressure.

60
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,410
我在考慮  下星期過去待一兩個小時
Um, I'm thinking of maybe coming in for an hour or two next week.

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,610
隨機應變就行
Maybe kind of play it by ear.

62
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,400
如果你愿意的話
Well, ‭i-if you feel comfortable.

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,400
我們當然很歡迎你
I mean, we certainly would love to have you.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
我們什么都能接受
We will take anything we can get.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,330
日子定了我讓歐內斯托提前通知你們一聲
I'll figure out a day and get Ernesto to give you a heads up.

66
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,550
不錯
That sounds great.

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,510
歐尼近來如何
How's Ernie working out?

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,170
大體上說  還不錯
Uh, he's been fine, for the most part.

69
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,470
太棒了
Excellent.

70
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,270
磯鷂渡一案  一切正常嗎
Everything on track with, uh, Sandpiper?

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,930
正在進行
Moving along.

72
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,250
戴維斯梅因律所真的很盡力
Davis & Main are, uh... really pulling their weight.

73
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,500
他們最好盡力
Well, they better.

74
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,580
案子很復雜
It's a complex case.

75
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,880
這案子肯定不是兩個人就能搞定的
Well, it's definitely not a two-man job, that's for sure.

76
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,120
誰有吉米的消息嗎
Anyone, uh, heard from Jimmy?

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,050
我有  我跟他談過
I have, yes. I've talked to him.

78
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,600
他怎么樣
How is he?

79
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,210
他很好
He's fine.

80
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,940
還不錯
Doing well.

81
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,150
說到他  我有些消息
Speaking of which... I have some news.

82
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,210
他在戴維斯梅因律所工作
He's working at Davis & Main.

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,310
做什么
Doing what?

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,450
是做律師啊
Oh, working as an attorney.

85
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,260
克利福德·梅因雇了吉米
Clifford Main hired Jimmy?

86
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,600
說實話  他也有疑慮
To be fair, he had his doubts,

87
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,740
但他給了吉米一個機會
but he's giving Jimmy a chance.

88
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,590
他派自己的手下去跟客戶聯系
He had his own people doing client outreach,

89
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,300
但他們每次和磯鷂渡的居住者談話
but every time they would talk to a Sandpiper resident,

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,140
住戶就會讓吉米出馬
Jimmy's name would come up.

91
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,430
你知道的  他
You know, he...

92
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,910
-那些老人  他們  -他們喜歡他
- Those old folks, they just -- - They love him.

93
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,990
的確是
Yeah, they do.

94
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,350
另外  我猜克利福德希望
Plus, I guess Cliff thought it would be a good idea

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,630
案子有那種...
for the case to have that sort of, uh...

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
連續性
you know... continuity.

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,800
吉米待人處事有一套
Jimmy certainly has a way with people.

98
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,670
是啊
He does.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,120
戴維斯梅因律所知道他的背景嗎
They're aware of his background at Davis & Main?

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,600
他的教育情況
His education?

101
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,090
不瞞你說
In the spirit of full disclosure,

102
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,970
克利福徳之前確實跟我談過
Cliff did talk to me beforehand.

103
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,620
我都實話跟他說了
I didn't pull any punches.

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,290
我盡可能客觀地跟他說
I tried to paint a complete picture.

105
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,740
但我沒有礙事
But I didn't stand in the way.

106
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,500
當然了
Of course not.

107
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,330
你也不應該礙事
Nor should you.

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,540
說實話
Truth be told...

109
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,270
金·韋克斯勒為此事極力爭取
Kim Wexler pushed for this -- hard.

110
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,810
但我沒礙事
But I didn't, uh, you know, stand in the way.

111
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,040
合伙人機會

112
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,170

I would, uh...

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,690

Yeah.

Assume so.

115
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,090
真不錯
That's great.

116
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,270

Anything else you need me to add to Ernie's list?

121
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,210
不用  都有了
No. All set. All good.

它們都吃燕麥吧
It's oats ‭that they're always eating?

-很值  -還有馬蹄鐵
- It's worth it. - ‭And the horseshoes.

179
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,490
你得給它們用錘子裝備好"鞋"
You have to get them shoes and nail them with a hammer.

Uh, okay.

230

你來這干什么
Why are you here?

231
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,740
我有事找警察
I-I have business with the police.

232
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,120
是什么事呢
And what business might that be?

如果你非要知道的話  我被搶劫了
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.

234
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,810
有人闖進我家  偷走了我的財產
Somebody broke into my house and stole my property.

235
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,160
你的毒品吧
Your drugs.

236
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,870
是的  但顯然我沒對警察說
Yeah, but obviously I didn't tell the cops that.

237
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,230
我又不蠢
I'm not stupid.

238
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,950
你已經和他們說過情況了嗎
You've already spoken to them?

239
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,610
兩個警察來過我家
A couple of them came by my house.

240
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,050
但我在意的不是毒品
But it's not the drugs that I care about.

241
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,510
不  我在意
I mean, I care.

242
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,340
但我更想討回我的棒球卡片
It's my baseball cards I need back.

243
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,530
-你的棒球卡片  -是的
- Your baseball cards? ‭- Yes.

244
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,760
我有一套非常珍貴的棒球卡片集
I have a very valuable collection of baseball cards,

245
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,190
被人偷走了
and someone stole them.

246
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,190
我就知道還得我來跟你說
I guess I shouldn't be surprised I have to tell you this.

247
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,120
你已經是個罪犯了  還主動找警察談話
But it's probably a bad idea that you willingly talk to the police,

248
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,440
這大概不是個好主意
being a criminal and all.

249
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,620
我又不是以罪犯的身份來的
I'm not here as a criminal.

250
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,080
我是受害者
I'm here as a crime victim.

251
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,050
我只是偶爾賣賣藥品
Just because I occasionally sell some pharmaceuticals,

252
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,530
就要失去受法律保護的權利嗎
I no longer have a right to protection from crime?

253
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,410
而且我和他們談的時候非常謹慎
And I was very careful when I talked to them.

254
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,790
他們不知道我賣藥
I -- they have no idea about my other business.

255
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,600
既然你已經報告過情況了  為什么還要來
If you already made your report, why are you here?

256
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,690
他們喊我來的
They called me.

257
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,200
說還有幾個問題要問
They have a few more questions.

258
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,630
他們很努力地在尋找小偷
They are very dedicated to finding this thief.

259
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,730
既然你還是個新手  我來給你解釋一下
Since you're new to this, let me explain it to you.

260
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,310
他們在釣魚
They've invited you on a fishing trip.

261
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,280
什么意思  釣魚
What's that? A fishing trip?

262
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,850
那些警察對討回你的卡片根本沒興趣
Those cops have no interest in helping you get your cards back.

263
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,090
他們顯然懷疑你
You're obviously under suspicion.

264
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,400
他們什么也沒看到啊
There was nothing there for them to see.

265
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,080
你想想我們之前的談話
I refer you ‭to our previous conversation

266
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,170
再看看這個如霓虹燈般閃閃發光的

that says "Drug dealer."

268
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,590
他們懷疑你
They suspect you.

269
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,500
他們會讓你進去  裝作是你的朋友
They will get you in there, pretend to be your friend,

270
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,310
給你一種虛假的安全感
lull you into a false sense of security,

271
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,450
然后他們會讓你心虛
and then they will sweat you.

272
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,790
你就會露出破綻
and you will break.

273
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,490
我不  我
I don't -- I --

274
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,590
我不同意
I disagree.

275
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,210
沒有商量的余地  你現在就回家
Not open for debate. You go home now.

276
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,830
但是我和他們約好了啊
But I have an appointment.

277
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
爽約
Break it.

278
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,240
如果他們打電話給你  別接
And if they call you, do not answer the phone.

279
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,060
那我的棒球卡片怎么辦
But what about my baseball cards?

280
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,480
那是你生意的代價
Cost of doing business.

281
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,800
不行  不不不
No! No, no, no!

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
我得討回來
I am getting those back!

283
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,400
我愿意冒險
I will take the risk!

284
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
不  你不能冒險
No, you won't.

285
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,910
因為你會把我也置于險境
Because then you'll be putting my well-being at risk.

286
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,560
我只能這樣
I have to!

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,180
我也很高興能加入這里
Um, I'm happy to be here.

322
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,570
很好
Great.

323
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,800
我該回去工作了
Uh, better get back to it.

324
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,570
好的  我也該工作了
Yeah, me, too, I suppose.

325
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,400
其實  我在首次信息披露中發現了點東西
Actually, um, ‭I might have found something in the initial disclosures.

326
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,910
-是嗎  -斯韋卡特和考科利不斷提到
- Oh, yeah? - Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,240
這是一個"可選的津貼項目"
the "Optional Allowance Program,"

328
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
但是我查了很多住戶的合同
but I checked a number of residents' contracts.

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,760
所有合同都選擇了這個津貼計劃
Not a single one has opted out, which makes me think

330
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,620
我認為這更像是一個強制性的財務安排
it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement.

331
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,430
你認為這就是他們在提交的材料中所指的
And you're thinking that's the "Failure to state a claim"

332
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,970
"對起訴的申辯"嗎
that they filed in their answer?

333
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,410
他們不斷強調這是可選計劃  是自愿的
They keep saying it's optional, thereby voluntary.

334
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,020
我們可以利用這點來反擊
I think we can counter that

335
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,350
如果入住的前提條件是必須"選擇加入"
if "Opting in" is a requirement for residency,

336
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,850
事實也是如此
which it sure seems to be,

337
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,580
那他們聲稱的"自愿"就站不住腳了
well, their voluntary claims don't hold water.

338
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,710
你這個發現可能意義重大
Might be on to something here.

339
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,180
干得漂亮  吉米
Nice work, Jimmy.

340
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,930
謝謝  克利福德
Thanks, Cliff.

341
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,760
你好
Hola.

342
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,960
你好啊
Hola. Cómo estás?

343
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,050
歡迎光臨  有什么能為您效勞的
Welcome. How can I help you?

344
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,540
我想打聽下價錢
Um, I was hoping to get an estimate.

345
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,500
是我的車
Uh, mi car. Mi coche.

346
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,760
你們可以干車子的活吧
You do cars?

347
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,620
當然可以  沒問題
Sí. Cars. Todo el tiempo.

348
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,350
我想把坐椅的椅面換一下
I-I was hoping ‭to get my seats reupholstered.

349
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,960
跟我出去看一下好嗎
Um, take a look? Mira?

350
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,050
-稍等一下  -好的
- Un momento. - ‭Sí, sí, sí, sí.

351
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
謝謝
Gracias.

352
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,690
就是這輛
Yeah.

353
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,150
換點新鮮東西
Thinking something new.

354
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,930
給這個老家伙一點寵愛
Give the old girl a little love.

355
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,730
{\an8}我很高興做這個工作
但是有這些錢還不如買輛新車

356
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,200
他說你還是留著錢買輛新車比較劃算
He said you should save your money and get a new car.

357
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,530
是嗎  但是我對這輛車有特殊的感情
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

358
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,430
古董車
Classic car.

359
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,970
{\an8}他想要什么樣的

360
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,350
椅面想用什么材料
What material do you want?

361
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,020
當然是皮的
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

362
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,030
鱷魚皮就不錯
Maybe alligator.

363
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,170
那要花好多錢呢
Señor. Too much money.

364
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,770
是  但我說了  我對這車有感情
Yeah, but like I said, it has a sentimental value.

365
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,240
{\an8}我覺得奇奇怪怪的皮革跟這車不太配

366
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,230
{\an8}換點跟車的風格更搭的材料比較好

367
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,200
{\an8}說服他

368
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,560
他說鱷魚皮跟這輛車不搭
He says, uh, alligator's gonna look all wrong.

369
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,910
便宜點的材料更好
Cheaper might be better.

370
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,060
給我看看你選的
Well, show me what you'd pick.

371
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,510
抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, señor.

372
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,990
我兒子  讓他來幫你  行嗎
My son -- ‭he -- he will help you, okay?

373
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,890
{\an8}幫他選個材料

374
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,000
{\an8}別給他推銷貴的了

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,870
見到你很高興
Mucho gusto.

376
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,190
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

377
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,350
你找我干什么
Why are you here?

378
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,840
棒球卡
Baseball cards.

379
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,850
我猜  你看到那個開豪車的中年危機男
The way I figure, you saw that mid-life crisis of a vehicle

380
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,970
就明智地決定不和他做生意了
and wisely decided ‭to cut ties with the man,

381
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,830
這我不怪你  因為我也不和他做了
and I don't blame you -- I did, too.

382
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,270
但是你劫了他家
And then you ripped him off.

383
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,430
我相信順走那些棒球卡
And I'm sure those baseball cards

384
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,500
還能從那個蠢貨身上額外撈一筆
looked like an easy way to make a few extra bucks

385
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,060
順便還能給他上一課
off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.

386
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,940
但是你低估了
But you underestimated

387
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,640
這個人有多么白癡
just how big an idiot you were dealing with.

388
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,660
不  我很清楚
No, I am pretty aware.

389
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,810
好吧  那么你低估了
Well, then, you underestimated

390
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,940
這個人對這些棒球卡片的感情有多深
how attached the man was to those cards --

391
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,200
深到他打給警察報失
so attached he called the police and reported them stolen.

392
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,750
現在警察在到處查
Now they're nosing around.

393
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,790
這好像是你的問題
That sounds like a "you" problem.

394
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,610
不  我覺得更像是我們的問題
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.

395
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,580
我想我還是碰碰運氣吧
Yeah, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.

396
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,730
不過祝你好運
But good luck to you.

397
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,630
我還希望你能看到我們的困境
You know, I was hoping you'd see our dilemma

398
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,980
做出正確的選擇
and do the right thing.

399
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,480
但我想現在是一個軟硬兼施的情況
But I think what we have here now is a carrot-and-stick situation.

400
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,780
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

401
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,490
這是要來硬的嗎
This is the stick? Hmm?

402
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,890
你來威脅我的家人嗎
You coming here, threatening my family?

403
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,430
你得再強硬些  老東西
'Cause you're gonna need a bigger stick, old man.

404
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,500
我不是要威脅你的家人
I'm not here to threaten your family.

405
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,490
真正的狠角色是屠庫·塞拉曼加
And the name of the stick is Tuco Salamanca.

406
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,970
如果你不照我說的做  恕我直言
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak,

407
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,060
屠庫要是發現了你的第二職業
and Tuco finds out about your little side business.

408
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,060
這夠硬了嗎
That a big enough stick?

409
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,400
不過  我還是更喜歡軟的
However, I prefer the carrot.

410
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,710
我覺得你也會喜歡
I think you will, too.

411
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,210
那要怎么做
And what would that be?

412
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,330
你把棒球卡片還給我
You give me back the baseball cards,

413
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,600
還有一萬美金現鈔
$10,000 in cash,

414
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,050
你還可以凈賺大約
and you net roughly --

415
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,730
大約六萬美金
roughly -- $60,000.

416
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,970
那要如何做到
And how exactly does that work?

417
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,080
歐內斯托
Ernesto.

418
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,270
要出門嗎
Going somewhere?

419
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,890
是的
Yes, we are.

420
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,630
轉彎的時候需要些技巧
She's a little tricky around the corners.

421
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,500
而且  得加高級汽油
So... and you got to go with the premium gas.

422
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,520
我知道這好像是騙人的  但還是有很大不同
I know it seems like a scam, but it makes a huge difference.

423
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,220
我會一周洗一次車
And I would get her washed at least once a week.

424
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,170
還要手工打蠟
And spring for the hand wax.

425
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,940
這透明涂層需要多一層保護
You're gonna want that extra layer of protection for the clear coat.

426
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,910
這車值得最好的保護
She deserves the best.

427
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,760
我會確保拆車廠的伙計們
I'll make sure the boys at the chop shop

428
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,090
對她溫柔一些的
are real gentle with her.

429
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,930
等等  為什么要拆
Wait. W-why?

430
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,220
不
No.

431
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,070
你覺得我會開那輛車嗎
You think I'd be caught dead driving that thing?

432
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,860
那就跟六歲皮條客的校車一樣
It looks like a school bus for 6-year-old pimps.

433
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,050
好了  我們能繼續了嗎
All right, shall we move this along?

434
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,760
阿倫
Aaron.

435
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,550
好  這是基特那張
Okay, there's Jeter.

436
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,360
好的  好的
All right. Okay.

437
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,080
曼托  曼托  這是曼托那張
Mantle. Mantle. There's Mantle.

438
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,020
完事了嗎
‭We good?

439
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,120
是的  好像都在這兒
Uh, yeah, that looks like everyone.

440
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,920
都在  都在這兒了
Yeah, they're here. ‭Looks like everyone's here.

441
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,040
另外一樣
And now the other item.

442
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,720
現在我們的交易正式結束
And now our business is concluded.

443
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,360
我一直在想是不是該向你道歉
You know, I can't help thinking an apology was in order.

444
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,480
又是警察打來的
Uh, it's -- it's the police again.

445
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,500
磯鷂渡并沒有真正回應我們的披露請求
Sandpiper hasn't really responded to our discovery requests.

446
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,730
他們讓我們做了大量文書工作
They've buried us in paperwork,

447
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,750
但沒有任何東西跟這個案子的詳情有關
but nothing actually relevant to the particulars in this case.

448
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,200
意料之中
No real surprise there.

449
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,170
我們也許該要求他們出示銀行記錄
We may have to subpoena their bank records.

450
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,340
謝謝  艾琳  吉米
Thank you, Erin. Jimmy.

451
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,150
客戶那兒處理的怎么樣了
How we doing with client outreach?

452
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,520
我們在等那些傳票的同時
Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas,

453
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,800
還應該嘗試從客戶那里
I'm thinking we should try wrangling some of this stuff

454
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,300
獲取文件
from the clients themselves.

455
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,980
他們中大部分人都會保留復印文本
Most of these folks have hard copies of everything

456
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,880
可追溯到埃森豪威爾時代
going back to ‭the Eisenhower administration.

457
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,030
當然  考慮到他們的...
Of course, given some of their, uh...

458
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,770
不一致的組織方式
inconsistent organizational practices,

459
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,340
進展會很緩慢
it's gonna be slow going.

460
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,960
抱歉打斷一下
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

461
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,970
有一位女士  人很好
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet,

462
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,260
但是完全聽不見
but, uh, deaf as a doornail.

463
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,030
她把所有的文件都放在  放在
She keeps all of her paperwork in, um, she keeps it --

464
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,470
對不起  抱歉  吉米
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.

465
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,870
我需要所有人的手機
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,

466
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,570
鑰匙  還有電子設備
key fobs, and electronics.

467
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,570
查克  歡迎
Chuck. Welcome.

468
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,240
請坐
Please. Have a seat.

469
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,250
不要在意我
Don't mind me.

470
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,340
大家好
Hey, everybody.

471
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,370
抱歉打擾了
Sorry for the interruption.

472
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,790
就當我不在這兒
Just pretend I'm not here.

473
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,390
很高興你能來
Happy to have you.

474
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,400
吉米  我們說到哪兒了
Jimmy, where were we?

475
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,610
對
Uh, yeah.

476
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,050
我正說到...
So, I was saying...

477
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,570
從部分委托人那獲取文件
getting the documents from some of the clients...

478
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,910
他們中的有些人顯然是囤物狂
We definitely have some pack rats.

479
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,020
祝他們好運
God bless 'em.

480
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,340
我那天去拜訪圣達菲磯鷂渡的古斯多夫女士
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe,

481
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,730
那天下午我都在整理大賣場發放的
and I spent the whole afternoon sorting through just a haystack

482
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,080
成堆的菜譜和半價優惠券
of recipes and half-off coupons from Big Lots.

483
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,100
但整理的成果是這位女士
But now we've got copies of this woman's monthly statements

484
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,650
從1997年3月起的月賬單
going back to march 1997,

485
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,270
因此  盡管這樣有些耗費人力
so it might be a little labor-intensive,

486
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,550
但委托人永遠是我們最好的資源
but our clients will always be our best resource.

487
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,990
此外  他們那還有糖吃
Plus, they have ribbon candy.

488
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,640
吉米
Jimmy.

489
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,890
你好
Hello?

490
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,040
你來干什么
What are you doing here?

491
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,250
我名字就刻在這座樓上
‭My name is on the building.

492
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,650
很高興你能回來
So great to have you here.

493
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,710
如果你需要什么  我就在辦公室
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

494
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,430
你來干什么
Why are you here?

495
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,060
來親眼見證
To bear witness.

496
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,060
詹姆斯·麥吉爾
James Mcgill.

497
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,820
我是厄門紹特
It's Ehrmantraut.

498
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,490
你的道德觀念還夠靈活嗎
You still morally flexible?

499
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,090
如果是  我有個活兒給你
If so, I might have a job for you.

500
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,750
何時何地
Where and when?

501
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,330
請坐
Take a seat.

502
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,070
沃莫爾德先生  感謝你能前來配合調查
Mr. Wormald, thank you for coming in and talking to us.

503
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,200
當然
Yeah, of course.

504
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,660
我們看了警官在現場
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports

505
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,400
所寫的報告
that the officers took at the scene,

506
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,750
我們有幾個后續的小問題
and we have a few ‭small follow-up questions.

507
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,590
抱歉浪費你的時間  只是常規流程
Sorry to waste your time. Just standard stuff.

508
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,670
沒必要帶律師過來
There's really no need for a lawyer to be here.

509
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,430
我其實是來當他的顧問
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

510
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,610
丹只是想有個友善的人在他身邊
Dan just, uh, wanted a friendly face next to him.

511
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,420
我們都很友善啊
‭Well, we're all friendly here.

512
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,640
看看我們  四個朋友
Look at us. Four friends.

513
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,730
我們只是想理清事實
We just want to get the facts straight

514
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,860
以便幫你找回你的財物
so we can, um, help you get your property for you.

515
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,750
其實...沒關系的
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

516
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,850
用不著...
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh --

517
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,760
不  這只是常規程序
No, it's just standard procedure.

518
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,130
你知道  警官有時
You know, ‭officers don't always get

519
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,430
也無法把所有的所需信息寫進報告里
all the information we need in their report.

520
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,610
我們只是想抓住偷了你的棒球卡的人
We just want to find the guys who took your baseball cards.

521
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,620
是啊  那...
Yeah, that's, uh...

522
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,600
我叔叔有一張泰·柯布的煙草卡
You know, my uncle ‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

523
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,870
他把那玩意存放在十五厘米厚的玻璃底下
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

524
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,860
好像是幅名畫一樣
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

525
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,360
泰·柯布
Wow. Ty Cobb?

526
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,250
告訴他把光線調暗
Tell him to keep the lights low.

527
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,830
就算是人工照明也會釋放一定量的
Even artificial lighting has a certain amount

528
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,540
紫外輻射  那可能會...
of ultraviolet radiation that can, uh, you know...

529
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,490
長遠來看...
over the long term --

530
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,620
你能告訴我們
Um, can you just remind us

531
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,720
你在屋子里存放卡片的準確位置嗎
exactly where you kept your cards in the house?

532
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,550
好的  正如我想說的  那再不是問題了
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying to say, it's no longer an issue.

533
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,010
我找到它們了
I found them.

534
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,060
你找到卡片了
So you found the cards?

535
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,190
是的
Uh, yep.

536
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,190
我就是想親自過來  告訴你們
I just wanted to come down and tell you, you know, in person.

537
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,310
你找到了
You found them?

538
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,130
在哪  房子周圍嗎
Where? Around the house?

539
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,290
不是  我雇了私家偵探
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

540
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,250
他找到了卡片
and he tracked them down.

541
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,520
是的
So, yeah.

542
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,650
真的嗎  哪兒找到的
Really? So, where were they?

543
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,870
沒關系了  真的
You know, it's fine. It is.

544
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,310
我真的...我不能再打擾你們了
I really -- I ought to get out of your hair.

545
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,050
你們在我身上浪費的時間夠多了
You've wasted enough time on me.

546
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,050
不  不  沒關系  這是我們的工作
No, no, it's -- ‭it's okay. It's our job.

547
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,920
我們只是想弄清真相
We just want to get the facts right

548
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
以便幫你結案
so we can help close this case for you.

549
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,750
已經搞定了
It's done.

550
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,320
案子結了
Case closed!

551
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,380
我知道你們有多...
I just -- I know how much, you know,

552
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,140
你們有多少案子需要處理
you guys have on your hands,

553
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,980
殺人犯  搶劫犯  黑幫什么的
like murderers and robbers and gangs and stuff. I --

554
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,180
丹尼  你要不要出去透會氣
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

555
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,150
你去喝點咖啡
You can have some coffee.

556
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,270
我來和警探們說清楚
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

557
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,560
好了  伙計們  我們直說吧
Okay, let's get down to brass tacks here, guys.

558
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,010
我猜你們兩位制服整齊的警官
I'm guessing your two fine uniformed officers

559
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,110
發現了沃莫爾德先生藏東西的據點
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

560
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,970
所以你們才如此熱心地
and that's why you two are so interested

561
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,870
"幫助"我這位朋友
in "Helping" my friend here.

562
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,840
我明白
I get it.

563
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,600
在踢腳線背后發現藏匿地點
A hiding place in the baseboard --

564
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,030
任何人都會起疑心的
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

565
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:17,190
但我保證沒有違法的事
But let me assure you there's nothing illegal going on here.

566
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,080
那他為什么這么緊張
Then why is he so nervous?

567
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,650
因為要我說  流汗就值得懷疑
'cause I must say, the flop sweat is kind of suspect.

568
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,610
我們都有秘密  不是嗎
We all have our secrets, don't we?

569
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,610
又有誰是一塵不染的呢
And who among us is without sin?

570
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,480
但那些罪過不全是犯罪
But those sins aren't all of the criminal variety,

571
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,630
沃莫爾德先生也沒有犯罪
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

572
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,800
但那是很私密的東西
They are, however, very private.

573
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,010
私密  比如販毒嗎
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

574
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,470
不  當然不是
No, no!

575
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,230
他一直回避  因為那是個敏感話題
He's being evasive because it's a sensitive subject,

576
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,320
需要小心處理  和執法完全無關
very delicate, and of no concern to law enforcement.

577
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,660
盡管我們想相信你的話
You know, as much as we'd love to, um, take your word for it,

578
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,390
但你說的這些還不夠
we're gonna need a little more than that.

579
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,500
好吧  這都歸結到一起私人糾紛上
All right, well, this all comes down to a personal dispute.

580
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,630
就這樣
That's all.

581
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,400
是沃莫爾德先生
It's -- it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

582
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,320
還有他的藝術贊助人的糾紛
and, uh... his art patron.

583
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,250
-"藝術贊助人"  -沒錯
- "Art patron"? - ‭Yeah.

584
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,640
我的委托人和一個有錢人有一個協議
Uh, my client has an arrangement with a wealthy gentleman

585
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,970
沃莫爾德先生向他提供
for whom Mr. Wormald provides...

586
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,240
藝術品  以此獲得他慷慨的...
art in exchange for ‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

587
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,730
我們稱之為資助
We'll call it patronage.

588
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,330
藝術品  例如繪畫嗎
Art? Like -- like what? Paintings?

589
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,200
更像是電子媒體
It's more like digital media.

590
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,760
電子媒體
Digital media?

591
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,230
他為那個人拍視頻
He made videos for the man.

592
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,880
哪種視頻
What kind of videos?

593
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,110
具有藝術性的私人視頻
Private videos of an artistic nature.

594
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,140
那就是藏在暗道里的東西
That's what was in the hiding place.

595
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,440
就是這樣
That's what it's for.

596
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,220
那么這個藝術贊助人偷了視頻和棒球卡嗎
So, this art patron stole the videos and the baseball cards?

597
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,040
那是個誤會
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

598
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,480
還是叫創意分歧比較好
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

599
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,780
藝術家都是喜怒無常的
Artists are volatile creatures.

600
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,700
伙計們  這就是情人吵架
Guys, this all comes down to just a lovers' spat, okay?

601
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,810
兩個成年男子鬧翻了
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

602
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,820
常有的事
That happens.

603
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,050
贊助人偷了視頻
And the, uh, "Patron" stole the videos

604
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,880
還有棒球卡  我猜是為了"表明觀點"
and the baseball cards, uh, to "Make a point," I guess.

605
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,550
但關鍵是  都解決了
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

606
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,680
感情修復了
Hearts have mended,

607
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,840
沃莫爾德先生不會起訴
and Mr. Wormald will not be pressing charges.

608
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,320
視頻內容是什么
What was on these videos?

609
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,290
-很私密  -我知道
- They were private. - You've said that.

610
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,040
視頻內容意在
They were videos intended

611
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,190
刺激感官
to titillate the senses.

612
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,080
-好吧  是黃片嗎  -不
- Okay, so porn. - Not -- no.

613
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,960
不是這種
Not as such.

614
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,310
嚴格來說  應該是戀物視頻
Technically, they would be categorized as fetish videos.

615
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,210
但沒有違法內容
But nothing illegal.

616
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,990
就是一個男人  穿戴整齊  我補充一句
Just a man -- a fully clothed man, I might add --

617
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,210
只有他自己
Just all by himself.

618
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,000
沃莫爾德先生穿戴整齊
Just -- just Mr. Wormald fully clothed,

619
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,460
沒錯
yeah.

620
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,970
-就是這樣  -好的
- So... - All right.

621
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,120
所以穿戴整齊的沃莫爾德先生
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald

622
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,980
在做什么事
by himself doing what?

623
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,370
是啊  在做什么
Yeah, come on, man. What?

624
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,400
"蹲派"
Squat cobbler.

625
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,370
蹲什么玩意兒
What's a s-squat cobbler?

626
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,990
蹲派  你們知道的
Squat cobbler. ‭You know what squat cobbler is.

627
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,440
不  我不知道那是什么
No, I don't -- I don't know what a squat cobbler is.

628
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,100
我也不知道  那是什么
No, me neither. What is it?

629
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,210
你們兩是警察嗎
What? And you two guys are cops?

630
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,400
霍博肯蹲派
Hoboken squat cobbler.

631
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
滿月派
Full moon moon-pie.

632
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,760
波士頓奶油派
Boston cream splat.

633
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,410
真的嗎
Seriously?

634
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,520
蹲男"西蒙"
Simple-simon-the-ass-man.

635
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,560
荷蘭蘋果蹲
Dutch apple ass.

636
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,210
伙計們  我說的不是英語嗎
Guys, am I not speaking english here?

637
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,740
蹲派到底是什么
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

638
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,860
就是一個男人坐在派里
It's when a man sits in pie!

639
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,320
他坐在派里
He sits in a pie!

640
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,520
還來回扭動
And he... he wiggles around.

641
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,120
也許是好樂門蛋黃醬
Maybe it's like Hellmann's mayonnaise.

642
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,300
落基山以西有不同的叫法
It has a different name west of the Rockies.

643
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,190
我也不知道  但嚴格來說
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

644
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,000
他是邊哭邊蹲的
He does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

645
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,240
所以看起來更專業
which makes it more specialized.

646
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
不是所有蹲派者都要哭的
Not all pie sitters cry.

647
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,780
但我要說的是
But I'm gonna tell you something.

648
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,410
這家伙一哭起來
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

649
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,350
演得比朱麗安·摩爾還棒
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

650
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,390
派
Pies?

651
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,520
比如蘋果派嗎
What? Like apple?

652
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,430
伙計  不是我拍的好嗎
Guys, I'm not ‭the filmmaker here, all right?

653
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,570
有香蕉奶油  桃子
Banana cream. I -- uh, peach.

654
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,200
哦對  還要穿道具服裝
Oh, and there -- ‭and there is a costume involved.

655
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,770
你忽悠我們呢
You got to be shitting us.

656
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,020
是啊  隨便你們信不信
Yeah, like I would make this up.

657
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,740
大千世界無奇不有  兄弟
Hey, the world is ‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

658
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,770
不過相信我
But trust me on this.

659
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,500
你們不會想看的
You don't want to see it.

660
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,250
所以  沒事了  是吧
So, uh, we're good, right?

661
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,020
是  沒問題了
Yeah. Great.

662
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,740
不過  還有一個小隱患  要善后
There is, however, one little, tiny hanging chad.

663
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,670
什么  什么隱患
Well, what? What chad?

664
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,320
你得拍一個視頻
You're gonna have to make a video.

665
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,200
等等等等
wait. Wait.

666
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,400
他是把餡餅吃了還是坐在餡餅里
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

667
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,750
都有  想要什么有什么
Both. Whatever you want.

668
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,220
哪個先來
Which comes first?

669
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,200
隨便他選
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

670
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,730
這時候就該上哭戲了  是吧
That's where the crying comes in, right?

671
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,300
哭戲是必須的
That's a safe bet.

672
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,910
你到底是怎么想出這主意的
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

673
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,910
就是給我一百年
If you gave me a million years,

674
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,710
我也想不出這玩意
I still would not have come up with that.

675
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,710
靈感女神
The muse.

676
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,150
我說出了她的想法
She speaks through me.

677
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,160
我不過是區區傳話筒
I am but a humble vessel.

678
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,650
他們信了嗎
And they bought it?

679
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,100
信了
Yeah.

680
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,970
我也聽說過一些很離譜讓人難以相信的情節
I've heard some far-out scenarios used to sow doubt,

681
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,700
但這絕對是最扯淡[贏得蛋糕]的
but this definitely takes the cake.

682
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,690
金  金  金
Kim, Kim, Kim.

683
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,460
-知道啦是"餡餅"  -對
- Takes the pie. ‭- Yeah.

684
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,410
抱歉
Sorry.

685
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,350
我現在應該跳樓謝罪
I should just jump off the roof right now.

686
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,040
對啊  你是該自責
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

687
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,860
天哪  你可真能謅
Jesus, can you tell a story.

688
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,690
我覺得其實是那視頻讓他們信了
Well, to be fair, I think it was the video that clinched it.

689
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,490
什么視頻
What video?

690
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,380
等等  你們真的拍了一個視頻
Wait, wait. You -- ‭you actually made a video?

691
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,160
不得不說  到最后  老丹還挺入戲的
I got to say, in the end, Ol' Dan really committed.

692
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,230
那眼淚把我都打動了
I believed the tears.

693
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,560
這個是剩下的道具  多出來的
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

694
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,310
我不確定我們要拍幾條  就多買了些
I wasn't sure how many takes we would need, so I over-bought,

695
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,020
不過我保證  絕對沒被屁股坐過
But I promise you, ‭untouched by human buttocks.

696
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,680
你偽造證據
You fabricated evidence?

697
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,060
我就拍了個視頻
I made a video.

698
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,150
算不上證據
Not exactly evidence.

699
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,810
你用它來為委托人脫罪
You used it to exonerate a client.

700
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,160
你用偽造的證據為委托人脫罪
You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client.

701
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,350
你這是鉆牛角尖
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

702
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,930
我沒有鉆牛角尖
I'm not splitting hairs.

703
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,360
萬一戴維斯梅因律所發現你偽造證據怎么辦
What if Davis & Main find out you faked evidence?

704
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,230
他不是戴維斯梅因律所的客戶
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

705
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,870
這不是什么案子  無償的
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

706
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,210
與工作無關  完全是  我的私事
It was off the clock. It was, uh, totally my own thing.

707
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,210
為什么
Why?

708
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,030
你為什么要冒丟工作的風險
Why would you risk the best job you've ever had

709
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,010
就為了一個無償服務的案子
for some pro-bono case?

710
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,880
我是幫朋友的忙
I was doing a favor for a friend.

711
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,710
冒著被取消律師資格的風險  真是良友
Risking disbarment? That's -- that's some friend.

712
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,020
沒事的  事情解決了
It's fine! It -- it worked out.

713
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,330
戴維斯梅因律所并不知情
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

714
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,040
吉米  你這是在玩火
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

715
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,500
那天晚上那個混蛋肯
I didn't see you complaining

716
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,040
幫我們付酒單的時候  我可沒見你抱怨
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid our bar bill the other night.

717
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,550
是吧  那也有點違反規定了吧
No, that was a little bit of rule breaking right there.

718
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,410
要是我沒記錯  你還挺喜歡的
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

719
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,170
很喜歡
A lot.

720
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,950
這完全不是一回事
That is so not the same thing.

721
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,580
怎么不是一回事  有什么區別
How? What's the difference?

722
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,100
那與工作無關
That had nothing to do with work.

723
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,270
而且我們就是在胡鬧
And we were just -- just screwing around.

724
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
但是這個
This?

725
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,890
偽造證據
Fabricating evidence.

726
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,850
吉米  這真的可能會害了你
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

727
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,660
如果他們發現了  如果你被抓
If they find out, if you get caught --

728
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,720
這  他們永遠不會發現的
It -- they're never gonna find out.

729
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,350
你不是吧
Seriously?

730
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,020
這話說得就跟那些蠢蛋罪犯一模一樣
You sound like every dumb criminal out there.

731
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,600
如果你再這么干  他們遲早會發現
If you keep this up, they will find out.

732
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,410
你圖什么  吉米
For what, Jimmy? ‭

733
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,500
到底為了什么
What is the point?

734
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,170
我不想再看到你做這種事情
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

735
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,570
一次也不行了  聽到了嗎
Ever again. Okay?

736
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,810
我認真的  吉米
I mean it, Jimmy.

737
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,480
不會再有了
You won't.
