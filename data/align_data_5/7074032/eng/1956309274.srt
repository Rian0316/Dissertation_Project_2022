00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,396
He and the other guy ordered some food,
and they're just sitting.

This is the best chicken I've ever had.

Well, heh, heh,
I am delighted to hear that.

357

No, really, I'm serious. I mean...

...it's crispy, but it's not dried out.

And the seasoning, it's so flavorful.

Is there anything else I can do for you?

Would you be interested in franchising?

Because I would be eager to invest.

369
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,197
Well, perhaps we should go to my office,
where we can discuss it further.

370
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,113
Excellent.

You have how many restaurants?

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,436
- Seven.

It's incredible.

- ...to give you our deepest thanks.
- Well, for what?

For what?

383
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,672
For saving Don Hector's life.

384
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,360
I just visited him.

385
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,150
You know, seeing a man like that,
can't speak, can barely move...

386
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,517
I wanted to weep.

387
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,879
But it could have been worse.

388
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,158
Varga tells me that while everyone else
was picking their asses...

389
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,119
...you rushed to him, struck him
on the chest and brought him back.

390
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,351
It was a simple instinct.

391
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,997
But still, with all the history
between you two.

392
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,994
What you did was a gesture of peace.

Don Eladio is one shrewd bastard?

Maybe he likes the bad blood
between us?

398
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,116
He sits by his pool, baking in the sun,
giving orders.

...I'm sure Eladio wouldn't like that,
would he?

at the supplemental materials...

425
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,191
...there's a letter from my supervisor,
Brad Markham.

426
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,399
Ah. Good.

Mr. Finn and the people at CC Mobile

You don't have to sell many phones
to get in the Silver, believe me.

What made you choose
that particular field?

Honestly? Just to put bread on the table.

446
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,037
It has to do with the admissibility

- That was a Supreme Court case?
- That's right.

How did it go? "The only indicium
of reliability sufficient to satisfy...

...constitutional demands
is the one the Constitution...

...actually prescribes: confrontation."

451
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,072
It's classic Scalia.

I can't help but think about victims forced
to confront their assailants in open court.

Amendment is pretty controlling...

I've been doing my level best. Heh.

457
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,790
Mr. McGill, is there anything you'd like
to tell us about the reasons...

458
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,917
...you were suspended
in the first place?

459
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,077
This past year, that's pretty much
been the only thing on my mind.

460
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,992
And I'm humbled by the sheer stupidity
of my actions.

461
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,830
Remorse doesn't begin to cover it.

462
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,351
I'm not gonna make excuses,
because there's no excuse for what I did.

463
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,752
But as I sit here, I can assure you...

464
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,795
...nothing like that
will ever happen again.

465
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,634
Never.

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,999
Well, all right.
That would seem to be satisfactory. Uh...

00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,913
Meg? You have something?

468
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,190
Mr. McGill,
what does the law mean to you?

469
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,273
The law?

470
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,638
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

471
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,675
Um...

472
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,719
Listen, growing up...

473
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,358
...becoming a lawyer
was the last thing on my mind.

474
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,193
Even if I wanted to,
I didn't have the smarts or the skills...

475
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,829
...or the "stick-to-it-iveness."

476
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,358
But I happened to get a job
with some attorneys...

477
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,634
...and I couldn't help but think
"Maybe I could do that?"

478
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,397
Something inside me
made me wanna try.

479
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,160
Now, listen:

480
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,877
My diploma says the University
of American Samoa Law School.

481
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,114
And that's exactly what it sounds like,
that's a correspondence school.

482
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,159
I wish it said Georgetown, heh...

483
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,959
...or Northwestern.

484
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,909
But UAS was the only one
that would take me.

485
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,434
Because, let me tell you,
I wasn't a natural.

486
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,356
I mean, the classes,
the studying, trying to pass the bar?

487
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,749
Practically killed me.

488
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,038
I must have quit 10 or 12 times...

489
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,160
...but I kept coming back to it.
And I'm really glad I did.

490
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,836
Because when I got to work
with actual clients...

491
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,754
...there was nothing else like it.

492
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,200
Our legal system is complicated,
and sometimes it could feel capricious...

493
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,149
...but it's the closest thing
to real justice that we've got.

494
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,918
And for it to work, it needs vigorous,
passionate advocates.

495
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,436
Helping my clients, you know...

496
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,069
...arguing on their behalf...

497
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,074
...that's the best thing I've ever done.

498
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,711
And this past year...

499
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,791
...I've missed the hell out of it.

500
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,711
That was very eloquent.

501
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,716
