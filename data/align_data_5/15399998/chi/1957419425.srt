1
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,290
Cranford's giving you a look.

1
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,290
克兰福德正在给你看。

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,920
There. Go and have a look.
Go and have a look.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,920
那里。去看看。
去看看吧。

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,040
I don't know why. I saved a cow
of his last week.

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,040
我不知道为什么。我
上周救了他的一头牛。

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,160
Poor thing had colic.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,160
可怜的东西有绞痛。

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
对不起，女士们，先生们。

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,360
It says eight o'clock on there.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,360
那里说八点。

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Quite exciting.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
相当令人兴奋。

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
Hello! Hello.

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
你好！你好。

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,440
Thank you.

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,440
谢谢你。

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
And then a gasp of
amazement and satisfaction

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
然后是
惊讶和满足的喘息

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
runs around the world.

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
跑遍世界。

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,360
The Prime Minister decides to fly
to a personal meeting

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,360
总理决定飞往
个人会议

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,800
with the German Chancellor,
so after 69 years of a busy life,

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,800
和德国总理在一起，
在忙碌了69年之后，

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,120
Mr Chamberlain makes his first
trip in a plane.

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,120
张伯伦先生第一次
乘坐飞机旅行。

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
There's proof of his determination.

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
有证据证明他的决心。

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
The German Chancellor

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
德国总理

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
regards the situation,

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
看情况，

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,960
it seems to me, to be one in which
discussions between him and me

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,960
在我看来，是
他和我之间的讨论

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It'll get sorted.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
它会得到排序。

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,600
..may have useful consequences.

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,600
..可能会产生有用的后果。

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,720
Are your parents
still coming down to see you?

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,720
你爸妈
还来看你吗？

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,560
The day after tomorrow.
They can only stay the one night.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,560
后天。
他们只能住一晚。

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
Hello.

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
你好。

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
She's dead.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
她死了。

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
Dead?

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
死的？

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Aye, she is. Dead.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
是的，她是。死的。

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Not her!

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
不是她！

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Me cow, you silly beggar!

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,520
我牛，你这个傻乞丐！

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,480
I am sorry about that.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,480
我很抱歉。

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
And I don't think it was owt to do
with her stomach, neither.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
而且我不认为这
与她的胃有关，也不是。

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
Sorry.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
对不起。

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,160
And...

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,160
和...

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
And here's another thing,

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
还有一件事，

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
you never sent me
that salve you promised me either.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
你也从来没有把
你答应我的药膏寄给我。

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
What do you think?

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
你怎么认为？

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
That it's beyond saving.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
那是无法挽救的。

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,960
I thought I'd
get in for your parents.

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,960
我以为我会
加入你的父母。

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
They're still stopping by tomorrow?

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
他们明天还来吗？

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,720
Is there any more mustard?

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,720
还有芥末吗？

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
You've got legs.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
你有腿。

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,760
They're welcome to stay, you know.

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,760
欢迎他们留下来，你知道。

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
It's no bother making up
another bed.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
再铺
一张床也不费事。

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,160
They've got the inn booked.
They didn't want to impose.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,160
客栈已经订好了。
他们不想强加。

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Has your mum got any idea you're
not coming back?

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,640
你妈妈知道你
不会回来了吗？

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
I didn't want to do it
over the phone.

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
我不想
通过电话做这件事。

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,680
With everything else going on in
the world, maybe she'll mind less.

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,680
随着
世界上其他一切都在发生，也许她会不那么介意。

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
What's this?

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
这是什么？

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,920
Oh, just...looking to the future,

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,920
哦，只是……展望未来，

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
making decisions.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
做出决定。

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm still thinking about it. You're
a good vet. There's only one exam.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,040
我还在想。你是
个好兽医。只有一场考试。

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,520
I can help you revise if you like.
Aw.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,520
如果你愿意，我可以帮你修改。
噢。

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,200
My gallant crew, good morning!

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,200
我勇敢的船员们，早上好！

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,160
An enjoyable evening with Diana?
Mind your beeswax!

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,160
与戴安娜度过一个愉快的夜晚？
注意你的蜂蜡！

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,080
Oh, God, man, you smell like
a tart's handbag!

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,080
哦，天哪，伙计，你闻起来像
馅饼的手提包！

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,760
Parma Violet, if I'm not mistaken.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,760
帕尔马紫罗兰，如果我没记错的话。

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
I wondered where my bath salts
had gone!

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
我想知道我的浴盐
去哪儿了！

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Oh, he had a rough time of it
last night. Oh, aye.

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,840
哦，他
昨晚过得很艰难。哦，是的。

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,760
I was at the cinema with Helen...
I'll get it.

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,760
我和海伦一起去看电影……
我会明白的。

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,440
..but Cranford wouldn't stop
going on about some bloody salve.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,440
..但克兰福德不会停止
谈论一些该死的药膏。

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
I'll do it.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
我会做的。

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,760
It would have been nice to have
one night out with Helen

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,760
和海伦出去玩一晚就好了

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
that didn't end in disaster.

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
这并没有以灾难告终。

63
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
When are you going to stop this
nonsense and get wed?

63
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
你打算什么时候停止这种
胡说八道并结婚？

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Why are you laughing?

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
你笑什么？

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,960
You're not serious, are you?

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,960
你不是认真的吧？

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
But I've no money, no house.
Where would we live?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
但是我没有钱，没有房子。
我们会住在哪里？

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Here, of course. With Tristan
sleeping in the cupboard?

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
在这里，当然。特里斯坦
睡在橱柜里？

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
I wouldn't mind waking up
to Helen...

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
我不介意叫醒
海伦……

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,200
Sorry, that's inappropriate!
But it's true.

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,200
对不起，不合适！
但这是真的。

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,000
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,000
趁你可能时，收集你的玫瑰花蕾，
旧时光仍在飞翔；

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
And this same flower that smiles
today, tomorrow will be dying.

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
而这朵
今天微笑的花，明天就会凋零。

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm not getting married!

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
我不结婚！

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,960
You're getting married?!
I'm not!

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,960
你要结婚了？！
我不是！

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Caution - often a virtue,
but you carry it too far.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
小心——通常是一种美德，
但你做得太过分了。

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,160
You need to take a chance,
lash out a little.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,160
你需要抓住机会，
猛烈抨击一下。

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,400
Carpe some diem! Throw off these
hesitant ways

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,400
及时行乐！甩掉这些
犹豫的方式

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
and, remember, there is a tide
in the affairs of men

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
并且，请记住，人们
的事务有潮起潮落

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
which taken at the flood...

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
这是在洪水中拍摄的……

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Yes, Siegfried, all right,
all right.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,120
是的，齐格弗里德，好吧，
好吧。

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,680
Stop it. Who was on the phone?

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,680
停下来。谁在打电话？

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,680
Mrs Dalby. She wants you to look
over her stirks.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,680
达尔比夫人。她想让你看看
她的马鞭。

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
Why aren't you off to school yet?

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
你怎么还不去上学？

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
I just wanted to see about the cows.

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
我只是想看看奶牛。

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,320
Billy Francis Dalby, if you're not
on your bike this second...

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,320
比利·弗朗西斯·达尔比，如果你现在不
骑自行车……

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
Mum!

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
妈妈！

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
You must be proud of him.

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
你一定为他感到骄傲。

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
Oh, I am that.

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
哦，我就是这样。

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Now, I know you told me not to put
them out again,

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
现在，我知道你告诉我不要再把
它们放出来，

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,760
but we worked through the hay
so fast,

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,760
但我们干草的
速度太快了，

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
I couldn't afford to keep feeding
them cake.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
我负担不起继续喂
他们蛋糕。

91
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
I can see they've been suffering
with diarrhoea.Yeah.

91
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
我可以看到他们一直在
腹泻。是的。

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
It seems to have happened
within a few days.

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
这似乎是
在几天内发生的。

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,520
Maybe it's something they've eaten.

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,520
也许这是他们吃过的东西。

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
You have any idea what it might be?

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
你知道它可能是什么吗？

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
There's a few possibilities.

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
有几种可能性。

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
The most troubling is it could
be salmonella.

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
最令人不安的是它可能
是沙门氏菌。

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,280
Right.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,280
对。

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,160
Let's wait until we know before
we start worrying.

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,160
让我们等知道了再
开始担心。

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,120
I'll take some samples,
get them analysed,

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,120
我会取一些样本，
让他们分析，

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
and by tomorrow, we'll know what
we're dealing with.

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
到明天，我们就会知道
我们在处理什么。

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I sometimes wonder...

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
我有时想知道...

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,080
..maybe we'd be better off
if I'd just listened to you

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,080
..
如果我听你的，也许我们会过得更好

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
and sold up whilst we still had
the chance.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
在我们还有
机会的时候卖掉了。

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,680
You kept the farm for Billy,
to give him hope, a future.

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,680
你为比利保留了农场，
给他希望，一个未来。

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
Oh, we spent all that money
on cake as well.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
哦，我们也把所有的钱都花在了
蛋糕上。

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,920
We need to wait for the results
and then we'll deal with it.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,920
我们需要等待结果
，然后我们会处理它。

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,920
So let's stop all this talk about
moving on.

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,920
所以让我们停止所有关于
继续前进的讨论。

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Your life is here.
This is where you belong.

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
你的生活在这里。
这是你属于的地方。

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Thanks, James.

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
谢谢，詹姆斯。

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Don't forget to
stop by the house for a brew.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
不要忘记
在房子里停下来喝一杯。

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
Well, you see here, Mr Thomas,

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
好吧，你看这里，托马斯先生，

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,960
what I'm saying is
they call themselves vets,

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,960
我要说的是
他们自称是兽医，

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,880
and they're all right with cattle
and that class of thing,

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,880
他们对牛
和那种东西没问题，

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,040
but they're no use with cats
and dogs, you mark my words.

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,040
但它们对猫和狗没有用
，你记下我的话。

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
What you need is
some of my shampoos.

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
你需要的是
我的一些洗发水。

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,480
Oh, that will see him right as rain
in a minute, won't it, Rex?

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,480
哦，
一分钟后他就会像雨一样，不是吗，雷克斯？

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,720
Won't it, my sweetheart?

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,720
不会吧，亲爱的？

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
You're starting early.

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
你开始早了。

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,240
Do I detect a note of judgment
in your tone, Maggie?

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,240
我
从你的语气中是否察觉到一丝判断力，玛姬？

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,920
Far be it from me.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,920
离我很远。

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh, wheesht, Rex.

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
哦，咳咳，雷克斯。

122
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
You'll give yourself a sore throat.

122
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
你会让自己喉咙痛。

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
Rex!

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
雷克斯！

124
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,120
Come here, Rex!

124
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,120
过来，雷克斯！

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Rex!

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
雷克斯！

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,640
He came out of nowhere!

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,640
他不知从何而来！

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
It's all right. I'll take care
of him.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
没关系。我会照顾
他的。

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,200
What are you doing?!

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,200
你在做什么？！

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
Poor thing! Come on, now.

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
可怜的东西！来吧，现在。

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,240
Come on, now.

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,240
来吧，现在。

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,800
He needs a vet, Mrs Donovan. Rex...

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,800
他需要兽医，多诺万太太。雷克斯...

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
My boy!

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
我的孩子！

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,240
I've no doubt Mrs Donovan's
shampoos are marvellous for cleaning

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,240
我毫不怀疑多诺万夫人的
洗发水非常适合清洁

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
a dog's fur, but they'll do nothing
to mend a broken hip.

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
狗的皮毛，但他们不会
修补骨折的臀部。

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
If you'd like to wait, Mr Thomas,

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
如果你愿意等，托马斯先生，

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
then I'm sure Mr Farnon will be
with you in a minute.Thank you.

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
那么我相信法农先生马上就会
和你在一起。谢谢。

137
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Siegfried, hit by a car. Hold on!

137
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,360
齐格弗里德，被车撞了。坚持，稍等！

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,840
Hold on!

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,840
坚持，稍等！

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,720
What are you going to do to him?

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,720
你要对他做什么？

140
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,080
Mrs Donovan, perhaps you should
wait in the living room.

140
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,080
多诺万太太，也许你应该
在客厅等着。

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
I am not leaving my dog!

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
我不会离开我的狗！

142
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
What happened exactly?

142
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
究竟发生了什么？

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Oh, he bolted and then a car came.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,200
哦，他狂奔，然后一辆汽车来了。

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
Chloroform. There's no need.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
氯仿。没有必要。

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
Has he gone?

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
他走了吗？

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,640
No, he hasn't! That's my dog!

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,640
不，他没有！那是我的狗！

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,400
Massive internal haemorrhaging,
I think.

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,400
我认为是大量内出血。

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,640
I can feel damage
to the pelvic bone.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,640
我能感觉到
骨盆的损伤。

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,280
Nothing we could have done.

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,280
我们什么也做不了。

150
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm so sorry, Mrs Donovan.

150
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
我很抱歉，多诺万夫人。

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,840
Hi, James. How are you doing, Jenny?

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,840
嗨，詹姆斯。你好吗，珍妮？

152
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,760
Hello. Hello.

152
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,760
你好。你好。

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,600
What is it?

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,600
它是什么？

154
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
Oh, nothing. There was just
some pollen in the air.

154
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
哦，没什么。
空气中只有一些花粉。

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,280
That's it, Candy. Good girl.

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,280
就是这样，糖果。好姑娘。

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Jenny, you're not jinking off
school, are you?

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
珍妮，你不会放学
吧？

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,120
I said she could. She don't want
to miss the birth.

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,120
我说她可以。她不想
错过出生。

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,840
It's all Pythagoras and his blooming
triangles anyway.

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,840
无论如何，这都是毕达哥拉斯和他盛开的三角形。

159
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
How's that supposed to help me
milk the cows?

159
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
那怎么能帮我
挤奶呢？

160
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Speaking of which,
you might make yourself useful.

160
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
说到这里，
你可能会让自己变得有用。

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,680
I'll leave you pair to it.

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,680
我会让你配对的。

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
I was always trying
to skip school at her age.Really?

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
在她这个年纪，我总是想逃学。真的吗？

163
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,360
I always had you down as a bit
of a goody-two-shoes.

163
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,360
我总是让你失望，因为你有点像
双鞋。

164
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,280
I'll try not to take
offence at that.

164
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,280
我会尽量不
冒犯。

165
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,280
Shall we have a look at you, then,
Candy, to see how your foal's doing?

165
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,280
那么，我们要
不要看看你，Candy，看看你的小马驹怎么样了？

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
Many more calls today?

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
今天还有很多电话吗？

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,760
You're my last. I've got to get
a sample from the Dalbys

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,760
你是我的最后一个 我必须
从 Dalbys那里得到一个样品

168
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,440
over to Harrogate.
It could be salmonella.

168
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,440
到哈罗盖特。
可能是沙门氏菌。

169
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
Oh, that's the last thing
Phyllis needs.

169
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
哦，这是
菲利斯最不需要的东西。

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
When will you get the results?

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
你什么时候会得到结果？

171
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Should be a day. It's a fair drive.

171
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,240
应该是一天。这是一个公平的驱动器。

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
If you're able to get away, it'd be
nice to have some company.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
如果你能逃脱，
有一些陪伴就好了。

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,880
There's a few things I need to
finish on the farm first.

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,880
我需要先
在农场完成几件事。

174
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm happy to wait.

174
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
我很高兴等待。

175
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,280
I thought we could have dinner
with my folks tomorrow.

175
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,280
我想我们
明天可以和我的家人共进晚餐。

176
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
Together? All of us?

176
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
一起？我们所有人？

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, I'd like to introduce you to
them since you are...

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,680
好吧，我想把你介绍给
他们，因为你是……

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Well, we are...you know.

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
嗯，我们是……你知道。

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,800
And I met your dad.
I even wore his shoes.Right.

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,800
我遇见了你爸爸。
我什至穿了他的鞋子。对。

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,560
I must check I've got a clean
frock, then.

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,560
那么我必须检查一下我有没有一件干净的
连衣裙。

181
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
Do you think he suffered at all?

181
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
你觉得他受苦了吗？

182
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,580
I'm certain he didn't.

182
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,580
我确定他没有。

183
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,140
You can leave him here
if you'd prefer.

183
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,140
如果你愿意，你可以把他留在这里。

184
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh, no. My Rex will have
a proper burial.

184
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,260
不好了。我的雷克斯将有
一个适当的埋葬。

185
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,860
There's a spot down
by my boat...

185
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,860
我的船旁边有一个地方...

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,060
.. under a tree.
He used to like it.

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,060
.. 在树下。
他曾经喜欢它。

187
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Sounds perfect.

187
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
听起来很完美。

188
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,020
Shall I carry him over for you?

188
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,020
要我替你背他吗？

189
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,740
Aye, well...

189
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,740
嗯，嗯...

190
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,380
I suppose that's all right, then.

190
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,380
我想那没问题。

191
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Did you have him long?

191
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
你养他很久了吗？

192
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,520
Eight years all in. He must have
seen a lot of the world with you.

192
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,520
八年了。他一定
和你一起看过很多世界。

193
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
I'm sure he had a wonderful life.

193
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
我相信他过着美好的生活。

194
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,000
What would you know about our life?

194
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,000
你对我们的生活有什么了解？

195
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,240
No, no, I'm not saying I do,
I just imagine.

195
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,240
不，不，我不是说我知道，
我只是想象。

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,360
Whenever I saw him out and about
with you, he always looked happy.

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,360
每当我看到他和
你一起出去走走时，他总是看起来很开心。

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,600
You know where you are with a dog.
They're loyal.

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,600
你知道你和狗在一起的地方。
他们很忠诚。

198
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,480
They don't judge you for who or what
you are.

198
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,480
他们不会根据你是谁或
你是什么来判断你。

199
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,360
What is it you're after?

199
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,360
你在追求什么？

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Cos I'm telling you, if it's
money, you'll get none for me.

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,560
因为我告诉你，如果是
钱，你就拿不到我。

201
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm not after anything.

201
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
我不追求任何东西。

202
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,440
Right. Well, why are you
doing this, then?

202
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,440
对。那么，你为什么
要这样做呢？

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,440
Sure, you hardly know me.

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,440
当然，你几乎不认识我。

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,840
I saw what happened to your dog
and I wanted to help him.

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,840
我看到你的狗发生了什么事
，我想帮助他。

205
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,560
And I suppose, deep down, it also
means I wanted to help you too.

205
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,560
我想，在内心深处，这也
意味着我也想帮助你。

206
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,040
It's not just the animals.

206
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,040
不仅仅是动物。

207
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,760
Are you soft in the head?

207
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,760
你的脑袋软吗？

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,080
What are you on about?

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,080
你在说什么？

209
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,680
It doesn't matter.
Something somebody said to me once.

209
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,680
没关系。
曾经有人对我说过的话。

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,880
More than once.

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,880
不止一次。

211
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,880
You're a funny man.
Did anyone ever tell you that?

211
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,880
你是个有趣的人。
有没有人告诉过你？

212
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
More often than I care to mention.

212
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
比我更愿意提及的次数。

213
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,440
Well, you might take it
as a compliment.

213
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,440
好吧，你可以把它
当作一种恭维。

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
There's room enough in this world

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
这个世界有足够的空间

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,520
for folks of all
kinds of different stripes.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,520
对于
各种不同条纹的人。

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
Who's that fella?

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
那家伙是谁？

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
You're all right, he's with me.

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
你没事，他在我身边。

218
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
That's my boat.

218
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
那是我的船。

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
And my lamb there.

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
还有我的羔羊。

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
My Rex is dead.

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
我的雷克斯死了。

221
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
He felt nothing.

221
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
他没什么感觉。

222
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
You wains can help me
lay him to rest.

222
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
你可以帮我
让他安息。

223
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,120
How old were your parents
when they got married?

223
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,120
你父母几岁
结婚？

224
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,560
Dad said he were barely out of short
trousers when he asked me mam.

224
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,560
爸爸
问我妈妈时说他几乎没有穿短裤。

225
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,800
I don't know my parents got engaged.
Never thought to ask.

225
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,800
我不知道我父母订婚了。
没想过问。

226
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
No. You never struck me
as the romantic type.

226
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
不，你从来没有让我觉得
浪漫的类型。

227
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
I am romantic!

227
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
我很浪漫！

228
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
Oh, no, I didn't mean it
in a bad way.

228
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
哦，不，我不是故意的
。

229
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
I just meant you're not one
for grand gestures

229
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
我只是想说你不是
那种大手笔的人

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
or anything too extravagant.

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
或任何过于奢侈的东西。

231
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,800
I like that about you.

231
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,800
我喜欢你这一点。

232
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,960
My mum thinks if I stay in this job,
I'll never find a wife.

232
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,960
我妈妈认为如果我继续做这份工作，
我将永远找不到妻子。

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,480
And Siegfried thinks
I should just get on and marry you!

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,480
齐格弗里德认为
我应该继续和你结婚！

234
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
Oh! What did you say?

234
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
哦！你说什么？

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
I laughed.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
我笑了。

236
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
He said I'd a habit of being
too cautious,

236
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
他说我习惯了
过于谨慎，

237
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,400
that I don't have the courage
of my convictions

237
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,400
我没有
坚定信念的勇气

238
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
and see dangers
where there are none.

238
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
并
在没有危险的地方看到危险。

239
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
That's how Siegfried put it anyway.

239
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
反正齐格弗里德就是这么说的。

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
You know, there's
something in what Siegfried said.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
你知道，
齐格弗里德说的有些道理。

241
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,000
In what way?

241
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,000
以什么方式？

242
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, you do sometimes overthink,
see catastrophe round every corner.

242
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,000
好吧，您有时确实想多了，
每个角落都会看到灾难。

243
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
It's not something I want to do.

243
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
这不是我想做的事情。

244
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Then don't. Don't?

244
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
那就别了。别？

245
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,800
Overthink. Worry less.

245
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,800
想多了。少担心。

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,080
I wish I could.Well, you can.
I can?

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,080
我希望我可以。好吧，你可以。
我可以？

247
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,440
Why not?

247
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,440
为什么不？

248
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,400
Just decide to be
positive and take the plunge?

248
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,400
只是决定
积极并冒险？

249
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
What's the worst that could happen?

249
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
可能发生的最坏情况是什么？

250
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
You'd say no!To what?

250
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
你会说不！什么？

251
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,040
Asking you to marry me.

251
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,040
求你嫁给我。

252
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
Stop the car.

252
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
停车。

253
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,240
Helen, I'm fine with you
not being ready.

253
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,240
海伦，你
还没准备好，我很好。

254
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,520
I just...

254
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,520
我只是...

255
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,240
I just need a moment.

255
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,240
我只需要一点时间。

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
But I'm not afraid to say it.

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
但我不怕说出来。

257
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Say what?

257
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
说什么？

258
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,320
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

258
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,320
我想
和你共度余生。

259
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,720
Here in the Dales.

259
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,720
在山谷这里。

260
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm not afraid either.

260
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,800
我也不害怕。

261
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,520
You're not?

261
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,520
你不？

262
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,200
No.

262
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,200
不。

263
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,440
James, why do you smell like that?

263
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,440
詹姆斯，你为什么有那种味道？

264
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,360
I ran out of bath salts so I used
Mrs Hall's.

264
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,360
我的浴盐用完了，所以我用了
霍尔夫人的。

265
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
I may have overdone it somewhat.

265
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
我可能有点过头了。

266
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,200
What? Is it the smell? Don't worry,
it'll be gone in a couple of days.

266
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,200
什么？是气味吗？别着急，
过几天就好了。

267
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,000
It's not the smell. The ring?

267
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,000
这不是气味。戒指？

268
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,760
I haven't got a ring! You see, this
is the problem with not planning!

268
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,760
我没有戒指！你看，这
就是没有计划的问题！

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,400
It's Dad. I take it you haven't
spoke to him?

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,400
是爸爸。我想你没有
和他说过话？

270
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,200
Look Dad in the eye.

270
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,200
看着爸爸的眼睛。

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,480
And don't gabble. Sometimes
when you're nervous, you gabble.

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,480
并且不要胡言乱语。有时候，
当你紧张的时候，你就会胡言乱语。

272
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,080
What do you mean, I gabble?
I don't gabble. When have I ever...

272
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,080
你什么意思，我胡说八道？
我不胡说八道。我什么时候...

273
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,280
I hardly ever.
Unless I'm really nervous maybe.

273
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,280
我很少。
除非我真的很紧张。

274
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,040
Right.

274
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,040
对。

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
Something's wrong.

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
出问题了。

276
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,680
I would have sent for Mr Farnon.

276
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,680
我会派人去请法农先生的。

277
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,920
There's summat up with our
Candy. Come quick, will you?

277
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,920
我们的
糖果有总结。快点来好吗？

278
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,480
The uterus is twisted.

278
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,480
子宫是扭曲的。

279
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,160
And that's bad, is it?

279
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,160
这很糟糕，是吗？

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
Give me a hand.

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
帮帮我。

281
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
Now, when it's open like this, you
can put your hand straight through.

281
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
现在，当它像这样打开时，你
可以直接把手伸进去。

282
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,600
But if I twist it...
Nothing can get through.

282
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,600
但如果我扭曲它......
没有什么可以通过的。

283
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,160
That's what's
happening inside Candy.

283
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,160
这就是
糖果内部发生的事情。

284
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
And we need to unwind it.
If you can't?

284
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
我们需要放松它。
如果你不能？

285
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
We'll lose them both, love.

285
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
我们会失去他们两个，亲爱的。

286
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,960
Jenny, go up to the phone box
and call Skeldale House.

286
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,960
珍妮，走到电话亭前
，给 Skeldale House 打电话。

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,480
We're going to need some help.

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,480
我们需要一些帮助。

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,080
Oh.

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,080
哦。

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
Darrowby 2-2-9-7.

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
达罗比 2-2-9-7。

290
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, Jenny, hello, how are you?

290
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,200
哦，珍妮，你好，你好吗？

291
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,040
Mr Farnon?

291
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,040
法农先生？

292
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
He's just coming, love.

292
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
他刚来，亲爱的。

293
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Jenny Alderson.

293
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,160
珍妮奥尔德森。

294
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
Jenny?

294
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
珍妮？

295
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
I'll be out there straight away.

295
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
我马上就出来。

296
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
I'll get your jacket.

296
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
我去拿你的夹克。

297
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
Is something going on?

297
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
有什么事吗？

298
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,360
Problem with the Aldersons' horse.
James needs my help.

298
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,360
奥尔德森家的马有问题。
詹姆斯需要我的帮助。

299
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
Hold that.

299
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
拿着那个。

300
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
Thank you.

300
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
谢谢你。

301
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,040
This morning,
I had another talk

301
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,040
今天早上，
我又谈了一次

302
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,040
with the German Chancellor,
Herr Hitler.

302
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,040
与德国总理
希特勒在一起。

303
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Here is the paper...

303
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
这是纸...

304
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
Hello, you.

304
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
你好，你。

305
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,040
..which bears his name upon it
as well as mine.

305
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,040
..上面写着他
和我的名字。

306
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
Good book?

306
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
好书？

307
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
Mm.

307
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
毫米。

308
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,640
Some of you perhaps have already
heard what it contains...

308
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,640
你们中的一些人可能已经
听说过它包含的内容......

309
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,640
..but I would just like to read it
to you.

309
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,640
..但我只想读
给你听。

310
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,520
..the British Minister have had
a further meeting today...

310
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,520
..英国大臣
今天有进一步的会议......

311
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Siegfried! Wait!

311
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
齐格弗里德！等待！

312
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
..and are agreed in recognising

312
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
..并同意承认

313
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,240
that the question of Anglo-German
relations is of the first importance

313
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,240
英德
关系问题是最重要的

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,680
for the two countries
and for Europe.

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,680
为两国
和欧洲。

315
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,760
We regard the agreement
signed last night

315
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,760
我们认为
昨晚签署的协议

316
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,000
and at the Anglo-German Naval
Agreement as symbolic of the desire

316
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,000
并在英德海军
协定中作为愿望的象征

317
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,280
of our two peoples never to
go to war with one another again.

317
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,280
我们两国人民永远不会
再次发生战争。

318
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,480
Good evening, Richard, Helen, Jenny.
What's the presentation?

318
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,480
晚上好，理查德，海伦，珍妮。
介绍是什么？

319
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Uterus is still twisted.

319
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,320
子宫仍然扭曲。

320
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,000
It's too late to carry out
a caesarean.

320
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,000
剖腹产已经太晚了。

321
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,680
Don't worry, the cavalry's here.

321
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,680
别担心，骑兵来了。

322
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
So you're going to try to turn
her over to unwind it?

322
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
所以你打算试着把
她翻过来放松一下？

323
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,080
That's the plan. I'll take hold of
the hooves.

323
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,080
这就是计划。我会抓住
蹄子。

324
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,400
Siegfried, Mr Alderson, when I
say, roll the horse over.

324
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,400
齐格弗里德，奥尔德森先生，当我
说的时候，把马翻过来。

325
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
Hopefully it'll untwist
the uterus around the foal.

325
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
希望它能解开
小马驹周围的子宫。

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,720
Tris, give them a hand
if they need it.

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,720
Tris，
如果他们需要帮助他们。

327
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,400
Jenny, love... I'm staying. Ready?

327
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,400
珍妮，亲爱的……我要留下来。准备好？

328
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
Come on, then.

328
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
那就来吧。

329
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,840
It's all right. Candy was their
mother's horse.

329
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,840
没关系。糖果是他们
母亲的马。

330
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,680
It'll put everything right.

330
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,680
它会把一切都做好。

331
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,440
I've got hold of the feet.

331
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,440
我已经抓住了脚。

332
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,600
All right. Now, roll her.

332
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,600
好的。现在，滚她。

333
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,600
Stop, stop, hold on.

333
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,600
停下，停下，坚持。

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm losing grip
of the foal's hooves.

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,280
我失去
了对小马驹蹄子的抓地力。

335
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
All right.

335
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
好的。

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I've got them. Ready?

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
我有他们。准备好？

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,640
Go.

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,640
走。

338
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,840
Is it working?

338
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,840
它有效吗？

339
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,600
Yeah, I can feel it loosening.

339
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,600
是的，我能感觉到它在松动。

340
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
It's coming towards me.

340
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
它向我走来。

341
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
The foal's coming.

341
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
小马驹来了

342
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,120
It's coming. It's coming!

342
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,120
它来了。它来了！

343
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,160
It's coming.

343
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,160
它来了。

344
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,800
He's done it! It's out!

344
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,800
他做到了！出来了！

345
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,720
Oh. Evening.

345
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,720
哦。晚上。

346
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,680
Thought we'd drop by and see
if you fancied a stroll?

346
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,680
以为我们会
顺便过来看看你是否喜欢散步？

347
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,800
Let me grab my coat. Come here.

347
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,800
让我抓住我的外套。过来。

348
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Go one.Aw!

348
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,680
去一个。啊！

349
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,840
Go on.Go on. Aw!

349
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,840
继续，继续。啊！

350
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,440
One more, one more.
Come on, little one.

350
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,440
再来一张，再来一张。
来吧，小家伙。

351
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,840
Go on, little one.

351
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,840
加油，小家伙。

352
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,280
Yay! There we are.

352
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,280
好极了！我们到了。

353
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Our work here is done.

353
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,760
我们这里的工作已经完成。

354
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,280
I'll call her Joan. After mum.

354
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,280
我会叫她琼。妈妈之后。

355
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,120
Aye, that'll do.

355
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,120
是的，就可以了。

356
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,960
We'll, um, leave 'em be.

356
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,960
我们会，嗯，离开他们。

357
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,080
Mother knows what's best for 'em.

357
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,080
妈妈知道什么对他们最好。

358
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,960
Jenny...

358
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,960
珍妮...

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,680
Jenny. But...

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,680
珍妮。但...

360
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Must be going bloomin' soft.

360
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
一定要绽放'软。

361
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
She's, er...

361
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
She's, er...

362
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,480
She's a good girl, is Candy.

362
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,480
她是个好女孩，是坎迪。

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,360
Mr Alderson...

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,360
奥尔德森先生...

364
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,200
..I'd like to marry your daughter.

364
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,200
..我想娶你的女儿。

365
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
Right.

365
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
对。

366
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
You better come up to t'house, lad.

366
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
你最好到你家来，小伙子。

367
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,560
It's been good weather for t'hay.
Aye, it is. That's true.

367
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,560
t'hay 的天气很好。
是的，它是。确实如此。

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,800
Drop of rain won't do any ill, mind.
Oh, definitely.

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,800
一滴雨不会有什么坏处，介意。
哦，一定。

369
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
Definitely, just to...moisten it.

369
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
当然，只是为了……润湿它。

370
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,520
No, I'm fine.

370
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,520
不我没事。

371
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,320
Actually... Thank you.

371
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,320
其实……谢谢。

372
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,800
I had a wife in a thousand.

372
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,800
我有一千个妻子。

373
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,640
I've heard a lot about her.
She certainly sounds it.

373
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,640
我听说过很多关于她的事。
她当然听起来。

374
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,840
Nobody thought she'd settle for
a fella like me. You know?

374
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,840
没有人认为她会接受
像我这样的人。你懂？

375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
But she did.

375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
但她做到了。

376
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,280
One in a thousand, she were.

376
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,280
千分之一，她是。

377
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
Bit bloody stubborn, though,

377
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
虽然有点顽固，

378
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,080
she set her mind to it.

378
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,080
她下定决心。

379
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,680
I... All right, why not?

379
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,680
我……好吧，为什么不呢？

380
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,920
You know, I can't...

380
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,920
你知道，我不能...

381
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,320
I can't picture her face
the way that I used to.

381
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,320
我无法像以前那样想象她的脸
。

382
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
Time passes.

382
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
时间流逝。

383
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,160
But I see it in them girls of mine,
I see it in our Jenny.

383
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,160
但我在我的女孩身上看到了，
我在我们的珍妮身上看到了。

384
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,920
She has that look when
she gets cross, and

384
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,920
当
她生气时，她有那种表情，而且

385
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,880
our Helen has her smile.

385
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,880
我们的海伦有她的微笑。

386
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,280
I see it sometimes when I catch her
looking at you.

386
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,280
当我发现她
在看你时，我有时会看到它。

387
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,400
Aye.

387
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,400
是的。

388
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,120
Mr Alderson, I love Helen.

388
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,120
奥尔德森先生，我爱海伦。

389
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,720
I'll take care of her.I doubt that.

389
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,720
我会照顾她的。我对此表示怀疑。

390
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,440
She'll be t'one taking care of you,
lad. With your permission.

390
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,440
她不会照顾你的，
小伙子。在你的许可之下。

391
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
What for?

391
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
做什么的？

392
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,080
You've already asked her,
haven't you?

392
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,080
你已经问过她了，
不是吗？

393
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
I did. I have.

393
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
我做到了。我有。

394
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,800
How did you know?I told you.

394
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,800
你怎么知道的？我告诉过你。

395
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,760
That smile, her mother's smile.

395
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,760
那笑容，是她妈妈的笑容。

396
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
Listen.

396
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
听。

397
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,320
There's no point asking me
for my permission, lad.

397
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,320
没有必要征求我
的同意，小伙子。

398
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,800
That lass does exactly
as she chooses.

398
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,800
那个姑娘完全
按照她的选择去做。

399
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,360
Like her mother. Stubborn.

399
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,360
就像她妈妈一样。顽固。

400
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
That were Helen's mother's.

400
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
那是海伦的母亲。

401
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,200
My Joan.

401
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,200
我的琼

402
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
Might you use it?

402
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
你能用吗？

403
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
I'd be honoured.

403
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
我会很荣幸。

404
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,040
Thank you.Aye.

404
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,040
谢谢。嗯。

405
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,320
Good lad.

405
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,320
好孩子。

406
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,960
Leftover stool samples. Unlike
James not to have cleaned them out.

406
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,960
剩余的粪便样本。不像
詹姆斯没有把它们清理干净。

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,760
Lovely. Where is he, by the way?
Shouldn't he be up by now?

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,760
迷人的。顺便问一下，他在哪儿？
他现在不是应该起来了吗？

408
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,880
Didn't get back from the Aldersons
until late last night.

408
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,880
直到昨晚深夜才从奥尔德森家回来。

409
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,280
I know you want the salve,
Mr Cranford.

409
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,280
我知道你想要药膏，
克兰福德先生。

410
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,280
But we are not a delivery service.

410
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,280
但我们不是送货服务。

411
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,160
If you'd like to come by...

411
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,160
如果你愿意过来...

412
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,160
Get that bloody salve
sent over!

412
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,160
把那该死的药膏
送过来！

413
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,760
Rude man! Cranford?

413
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,760
粗鲁的人！克兰福德？

414
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
Need you ask?

414
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
你需要问吗？

415
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,200
I'll drop the salve round
for him later.

415
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,200
稍后我会
为他放下药膏。

416
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,840
Oh, there you are James. What time
do you call this? Sorry, Siegfried.

416
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,840
哦，你是詹姆斯。你这叫什么时间
？对不起，齐格弗里德。

417
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,840
Late night. I got waylaid at the
Aldersons.Ha-ha, really?

417
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,840
深夜。我在
奥尔德森被拦路了。哈哈，真的吗？

418
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Talking to Richard.
Oh, Richard now, is it?

418
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
和理查德谈话。
哦，理查德，是吗？

419
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,800
Asking his permission
to marry Helen!

419
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,800
请求他同意
嫁给海伦！

420
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,240
Oh, my goodness! Congratulations!

420
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,240
哦，我的天啊！恭喜！

421
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
Let me give you a kiss.

421
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
让我给你一个吻。

422
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
Well, hang on,
she hasn't said yes yet.

422
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
好吧，等一下，
她还没有答应。

423
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,600
She has! James, well done!

423
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,600
她有！詹姆斯，干得好！

424
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
I got the order of things
a little muddled up.

424
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
我把事情的顺序
搞得有点混乱。

425
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,560
I've got you to thank for that,
Siegfried.

425
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,560
我要感谢你，
齐格弗里德。

426
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes, well, you took your time
about it. Mr Farnon. What?

426
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,880
是的，好吧，你花了很多时间
。法农先生。什么？

427
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,680
Oh, all right. Well done.
Yes, very good, very moving.

427
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,680
哦那好吧。做得好。
是的，很好，很感动。

428
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
Drinks later to celebrate?

428
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
晚点喝酒庆祝？

429
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Let's see how dinner with my parents
goes first.Are you bringing Helen?

429
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,840
让我们先看看我和父母的晚餐怎么
样。你带海伦来吗？

430
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,280
Oh, they're going to be so pleased.

430
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,280
哦，他们会很高兴的。

431
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,520
Another busy day?

431
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,520
又是忙碌的一天？

432
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,280
A list far too long and varied to
encapsulate in a few brief words.

432
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,280
一个列表太长而且变化多端，无法
用几个简短的词来概括。

433
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,600
He said he had to come to it
himself. Oh, rubbish.

433
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,600
他说他必须
自己来。哦，垃圾。

434
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
What happened to doing as you're
damn well told?

434
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
像你说
的那样做是怎么回事？

435
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,000
Go on. You better be off to meet
your parents.

435
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,000
继续。你最好去见
你的父母。

436
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,880
Hold on. I had a phone call
from a lab in Harrogate.

436
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,880
坚持，稍等。我接到了
来自哈罗盖特实验室的电话。

437
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,080
They said they didn't find anything.

437
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,080
他们说他们没有找到任何东西。

438
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,760
Why are you smiling?
Is that a good thing? Aye. It is.

438
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,760
你为什么笑？
那是件好事儿吗？是的。这是。

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,280
There you are.

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,280
你在这。

440
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
Come on, then.

440
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
那就来吧。

441
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,520
What's this?

441
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,520
这是什么？

442
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,840
Come on.

442
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,840
来吧。

443
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,320
Good boy.

443
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,320
好孩子。

444
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,560
Good boy!

444
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,560
好孩子！

445
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,840
Come on, then, you.

445
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,840
来吧，你。

446
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,600
Come on. That's it.

446
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,600
来吧。就是这样。

447
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,440
Good boy!

447
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,440
好孩子！

448
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,280
There's my boy!

448
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,280
有我的男孩！

449
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,920
Give your ma a kiss.

449
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,920
给你妈妈一个吻。

450
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,480
Let me take that for you, Dad.
Thank you, son.

450
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,480
爸爸，让我替你拿走。
谢谢你，儿子。

451
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,120
We'll drop your things at the inn,
and then we'll go for a drive.

451
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,120
我们会把你的东西放在客栈，
然后我们会去兜风。

452
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,640
Where to? You'll see.

452
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,640
去哪儿？你会看到的。

453
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,560
On a beautiful day like this,
you can see for 20 miles.

453
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,560
在这样美好的一天，
您可以看到 20 英里。

454
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,200
But when the weather comes in,
it's a brutal place.

454
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,200
但是当天气来临时，
这是一个残酷的地方。

455
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,800
Snow ten foot deep, fog so thick
you can barely see your hand

455
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,800
雪十英尺深，雾太浓，
几乎看不到你的手

456
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,400
in front of your face.
I don't like the thought of you

456
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,400
在你的面前。
我不喜欢你的想法

457
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,120
going out in weather like that.
Thank goodness you won't have to do

457
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,120
在这样的天气出去。
谢天谢地，你不必这样做

458
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,440
this much longer. It's not so bad.

458
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,440
这要长得多。也不是那么坏。

459
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,960
Slipping off in the dead of night?

459
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,960
在深夜滑倒？

460
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,320
Not coming home until morning?

460
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,320
早上不回家？

461
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,320
You'll never find a wife carrying on
like that, you know. It's unnatural.

461
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,320
你永远找不到这样的妻子
，你知道。这是不自然的。

462
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,560
And those grandkiddies don't make
themselves, you know.

462
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,560
你知道，那些孙子孙女不会自己做自己。

463
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,120
Good to see you, Dad.

463
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,120
很高兴见到你，爸爸。

464
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,880
Pick the leaves like these, and
don't be pulling up the meadowsweet,

464
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,880
像这样摘树叶，
不要拔掉绣线菊，

465
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,600
cos it needs leaf to bloom.

465
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,600
因为它需要叶子才能开花。

466
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,920
Right. Look miserable.

466
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,920
对。看着好惨

467
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,200
Hello, Mrs Donovan.

467
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,200
你好，多诺万夫人。

468
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,200
What's up with this one, then?

468
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,200
那这到底是怎么回事？

469
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,560
He's a stray.

469
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,560
他是个流浪汉。

470
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
Where are you taking him?

470
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
你带他去哪儿？

471
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,480
Well, with no home to go to,
there's really only one option.

471
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,480
好吧，没有家可去，
真的只有一种选择。

472
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,880
We'll have to put him down.
Got no-one to take care of him.

472
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,880
我们得把他放下来。
没人照顾他。

473
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,640
No-one's going to want a dog
in this state. Give him to me.

473
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,640
在这种状态下，没有人会想要一只狗。把他给我。

474
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
I'll have him.

474
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
我要他。

475
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,960
Really, he should be
checked over by a qualified vet.

475
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,960
真的，他应该
由合格的兽医检查。

476
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Oh, I'll take care of him,
never you worry.

476
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,040
哦，我会照顾他的，
你不用担心。

477
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,360
He might benefit from those
shampoos of yours.

477
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,360
他可能会受益于
你的那些洗发水。

478
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,880
Maybe he's not as daft as he looks.

478
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,880
也许他并不像他看起来那么愚蠢。

479
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,240
Come on, down you get.

479
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,240
来吧，下来你得到。

480
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,080
That's it.

480
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,080
就是这样。

481
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,600
Why on earth have
you brought us here?

481
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,600
你到底为什么把我们带到这里来？

482
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,800
I've got a few jobs to get through
this afternoon.

482
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,800
今天下午我有几份工作要处理。

483
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm sorry. It won't take long.

483
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,960
抱歉。不会花很长时间。

484
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,240
All right there, Jim?
Afternoon, Phyllis.

484
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,240
好吗，吉姆？
下午，菲利斯。

485
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,040
These are my parents,
Hannah and James.Hello.

485
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,040
这是我的父母，
汉娜和詹姆斯。你好。

486
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,680
Afternoon. Hello.

486
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,680
下午。你好。

487
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,880
What we saying then, Jim?
Don't keep us waiting.

487
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,880
那我们说什么，吉姆？
不要让我们等待。

488
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,800
Thankfully, it's not salmonella.

488
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,800
谢天谢地，这不是沙门氏菌。

489
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,000
In fact, the laboratory couldn't
find anything wrong with them.Oh.

489
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,000
其实实验室也
查不出他们有什么问题哦。

490
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
There must be a mistake,
because I can see how bad they are,

490
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
一定有错误，
因为我可以看到他们有多糟糕，

491
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
and they're getting worse
by the day.

491
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
他们
一天比一天更糟。

492
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,520
There's something
I want to show you.

492
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,520
有件事
我想给你看。

493
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,160
Come on.
Why don't we take a look?

493
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,160
来吧。
我们为什么不看看？

494
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Come on! Oh...

494
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,240
来吧！哦...

495
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh!

495
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,000
哦！

496
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,360
See this light colouration
around the eyes?

496
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,360
看到
眼睛周围的这种浅色了吗？

497
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
It's like they've got spectacles.

497
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
就像他们戴着眼镜一样。

498
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,160
Aye, that's right, Billy.
Well spotted.

498
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,160
是的，没错，比利。
好眼力。

499
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,920
I noticed it last time I was here,
but I wanted to rule out

499
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,920
我上次来的时候注意到了，
但我想排除

500
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,120
everything else to confirm
the diagnosis.

500
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,120
其他一切以确认
诊断。

501
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,760
So, what is it?

501
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,760
那么，它是什么？

502
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
They're suffering
from copper deficiency.

502
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
他们患有
铜缺乏症。

503
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
You can tell by the loss
of pigment in the coat -

503
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
你可以通过
皮毛中色素的损失来判断——

504
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,160
particularly around the eyes.

504
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,160
尤其是眼睛周围。

505
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,360
I take it by the smug look
on your face you know how to fix it.

505
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,360
我看
你脸上沾沾自喜的样子，你知道如何解决它。

506
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,560
Certainly, I do.
A simple solution given orally.

506
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,560
当然，我愿意。
一个简单的口头解决方案。

507
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,680
It'll have to be repeated, to make
sure they don't get deficient again.

507
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,680
它必须重复，以
确保它们不会再次出现缺陷。

508
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,160
Other than that,
they'll have a long and happy life.

508
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,160
除此之外，
他们将拥有漫长而幸福的生活。

509
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,400
And it is very expensive?

509
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,400
而且很贵？

510
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,600
Cheap as chips.

510
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,600
便宜如筹码。

511
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,240
Yes!

511
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,240
是的！

512
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,560
We mix it,
and you administer it yourself.

512
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,560
我们混合使用，
您自己管理。

513
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
I'll have some ready for you to
pick up tomorrow.

513
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
我准备了一些让你
明天去取。

514
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,640
Good God, Jim, don't do that to me.

514
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,640
天哪，吉姆，别这样对我。

515
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,440
I thought for a minute there
we were beaten.

515
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,440
我想了一会儿，
我们被打败了。

516
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,080
I don't think you'd ever be that,
Phyllis.

516
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,080
我认为你永远不会成为那个人，
菲利斯。

517
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Well, better get back. Mm-hm.

517
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
嗯，最好回来。嗯嗯。

518
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,880
Get tea ready for the brood. Yeah.
Thanks, James.

518
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,880
为育雏准备茶。是的。
谢谢，詹姆斯。

519
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,240
Cheerio. Nice to meet you.

519
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,240
啦啦队。很高兴见到你。

520
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,680
See? Told you everything would be
all right. Yes, we made it.

520
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,680
看？告诉你一切都会
好的。是的，我们做到了。

521
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,640
It's beautiful up here, isn't it?

521
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,640
这里很美，不是吗？

522
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,400
Aye, it is.

522
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,400
是的，它是。

523
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,000
I'll drop you at the end
to freshen up.

523
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,000
我会在最后放下你
来梳洗一下。

524
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,200
Where are you gallivanting
off to now?

524
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,200
你
现在要去哪里？

525
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm bringing someone to dinner
I'd like you to meet.

525
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
我要请人吃饭，
我想让你见见。

526
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,640
I want to say...

526
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,640
我想说...

527
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,560
..that the settlement of the
Czechoslovakian problem...

527
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,560
..
捷克斯洛伐克问题的解决......

528
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,640
..which has now been achieved...

528
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,640
..现在已经实现了......

529
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,840
..is in my view only the prelude...

529
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,840
..在我看来只是前奏...

530
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,360
..to a larger settlement...

530
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,360
..到一个更大的定居点......

531
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,040
in which all Europe may find peace.

531
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,040
整个欧洲都可以在其中找到和平。

532
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,360
Careful, you'll get messed up.

532
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,360
小心，你会搞砸的。

533
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
James' parents have us down as a
right bunch of scruff-backs.

533
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
詹姆斯的父母把我们当成
一群无赖。

534
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Yeah, well, they need taking in.

534
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
是的，他们需要接受。

535
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
Otherwise they'll be roosting
all over the place.

535
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
否则它们就会
到处乱窜。

536
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,120
Give him here. Give him here!

536
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,120
给他这里。把他交给这里！

537
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
Ready to go?

537
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
准备好出发？

538
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,960
Erm, I'm just going to see if Deb
needs help with anything first.

538
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,960
嗯，我只是先看看黛布是否
需要帮助。

539
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Don't worry.

539
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
别担心。

540
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
They're going to love you.Hm...

540
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
他们会爱你的。嗯...

541
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,800
Is that...? Looks like something
on the back of your dress.

541
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,800
就是它...？看起来像
你衣服背面的东西。

542
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,440
You said I couldn't do
romantic gestures.

542
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,440
你说我不能做
浪漫的手势。

543
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
Get up, you daft beggar.

543
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
起来，你这个愚蠢的乞丐。

544
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,320
Is that...?

544
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,320
就是它...？

545
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
Is that me mum's?

545
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
那是我妈妈的吗？

546
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
It is.

546
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
这是。

547
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,360
James will be back soon.

547
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,360
詹姆斯很快就会回来。

548
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,240
Drink, anyone? Whisky perhaps?

548
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,240
喝，有人吗？也许是威士忌？

549
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
God, yes!

549
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
天啊，是的！

550
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,520
We won't actually.
We're not big drinkers.

550
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,520
我们实际上不会。
我们不是大酒鬼。

551
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
No, neither are we.

551
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
不，我们也不是。

552
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Special occasions.

552
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
特殊场合。

553
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
It's a fine place you have here,
Mr Farnon.

553
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
法农先生，这里真是个好地方。

554
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,280
James can't speak highly
enough about it.

554
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,280
詹姆斯对此怎么评价都
不够高。

555
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,440
Ah.

555
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,440
啊。

556
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
You must be sorry to be losing him.

556
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
你一定为失去他感到遗憾。

557
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
What?

557
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
什么？

558
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,680
What are you talking about?

558
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,680
你在说什么？

559
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,880
Oh, no, me and my big mouth.

559
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,880
哦，不，我和我的大嘴。

560
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,400
Did you not know?

560
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,400
你不知道吗？

561
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,880
Hello!

561
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,880
你好！

562
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,480
Sorry that took a while.
No trouble at all, son.

562
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,480
抱歉，花了一段时间。
一点都不麻烦，儿子。

563
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,280
Mr Farnon's been keeping us
entertained.

563
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,280
法农先生一直让我们开心
。

564
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,360
We were just talking about how sorry
he'll be to see you gone.

564
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,360
我们只是在谈论
他会多么遗憾看到你离开。

565
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
Yes, something of a shock.

565
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
是的，有些震惊。

566
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
No doubt we'll find a replacement
easily enough.

566
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
毫无疑问，我们会
很容易找到替代品。

567
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
Siegfried.

567
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
齐格弗里德。

568
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,800
Who's this? Aren't you going
to introduce us?

568
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,800
这是谁？不
给我们介绍一下吗？

569
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,200
Erm, right.

569
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,200
嗯，对。

570
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
Mum, Dad, this is Helen...

570
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
妈妈，爸爸，这是海伦……

571
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,160
..my fiancee.

571
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,160
..我的未婚妻。

572
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,840
Hello. How do you do?

572
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,840
你好。你好吗？

573
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
It's lovely to meet you both.

573
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
很高兴认识你们俩。

574
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,400
Tristan, would you like to come and
set the table for dinner?

574
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,400
特里斯坦，你愿意过来
摆桌吃饭吗？

575
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,800
Why don't I give you a hand?

575
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,800
我为什么不帮你？

576
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
Once you're married,

576
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
结婚后，

577
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,640
we'll see if we can't squeeze a
bigger bed into James' room.

577
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,640
我们会看看能否
在詹姆斯的房间里塞一张更大的床。

578
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,800
Oh, should be able to manage that.

578
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,800
哦，应该可以管理。

579
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,520
It'll be a busy house,

579
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,520
这将是一个忙碌的房子，

580
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,400
but I'm sure we'll all
rub along just fine.

580
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,400
但我相信我们都会
相处得很好。

581
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Mum, I want you to know this hasn't
been easy, but...

581
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,320
妈妈，我想让你知道这并不
容易，但是......

582
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
What?

582
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
什么？

583
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
What hasn't been easy?

583
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
什么不容易？

584
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
I should've told you sooner,

584
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
我应该早点告诉你的

585
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,040
but the truth is I didn't fully
know for a long time.

585
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,040
但事实是我
很长一段时间都不完全知道。

586
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm staying here,

586
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,640
我留在这里，

587
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,640
and it's not only because of Helen.

587
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,640
这不仅仅是因为海伦。

588
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,720
What about the job?

588
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,720
工作呢？

589
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,240
I was tempted, I won't lie.

589
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,240
我被诱惑了，我不会撒谎。

590
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
But thinking about it's made me
realise all the more

590
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
但想想这让我
更加意识到

591
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,160
how much I love it here.

591
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,160
我是多么喜欢这里。

592
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Every day is different.

592
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
每一天都不一样。

593
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,520
I wake up and I have no
idea where the job will take me.

593
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,520
我醒来，我不
知道这份工作会把我带到哪里。

594
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,720
I could be up in the High Dales
wrestling cattle

594
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,720
我可以在高谷
摔跤牛

595
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,560
or helping a dog that's had its
paw caught in a trap.

595
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,560
或者帮助一只
爪子陷入陷阱的狗。

596
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,120
It's this place, those hills...

596
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,120
就是这个地方，那些山……

597
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,640
James is too modest to ever
say this himself,

597
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,640
詹姆斯太谦虚了，
他自己从来不这么说，

598
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,080
but he's made such a difference to
so, so many people since he arrived.

598
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,080
但
自从他到达以来，他对这么多人产生了如此大的影响。

599
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,640
It's especially true for me
and my family,

599
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,640
对我
和我的家人来说尤其如此，

600
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,440
and so many others.

600
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,440
还有很多其他人。

601
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,920
That farm you visited today,
the Dalbys,

601
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,920
你今天参观的那个农场，
达尔比一家，

602
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,640
that's the second time
he's saved their herd this year.

602
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,640
这是
他今年第二次拯救他们的牛群。

603
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,200
What he does here really matters.

603
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,200
他在这里做什么真的很重要。

604
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,520
Oh, but Bill's place...

604
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,520
哦，但是比尔的地方...

605
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,360
You can work normal hours,
it's so modern and new.

605
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,360
您可以在正常时间工作，
它是如此现代和新颖。

606
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,080
That's not what makes a practice.

606
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,080
这不是练习的原因。

607
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
It's the people.

607
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
是人民。

608
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
I love this place.

608
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
我喜欢这个地方。

609
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
It's my home now.

609
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
现在是我的家。

610
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
You should be so proud of him.

610
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
你应该为他感到骄傲。

611
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,680
I certainly am.

611
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,680
我当然是。

612
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,040
And I love him

612
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,040
我爱他

613
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,240
with all my heart.

613
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,240
一心一意。

614
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
So long as you're both happy.

614
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
只要你们俩开心就好。

615
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,120
That's all we've ever wanted
for you.

615
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,120
这就是我们一直想要
的。

616
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,680
Aye, it's true.

616
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,680
是的，这是真的。

617
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
I wish we could convince you to
stay another night.

617
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
我希望我们能说服你
再住一晚。

618
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,720
No, we need to get back
and see about gaining some work.

618
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,720
不，我们需要回去
看看是否能获得一些工作。

619
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,600
I'll be back up to visit you
as soon as I can.

619
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,600
我会尽快回来拜访你
。

620
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Christmas maybe.

620
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
圣诞节吧。

621
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,720
Visit?

621
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,720
访问？

622
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
You don't visit your home.

622
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
你不去你家。

623
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,680
It's your real home,

623
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,680
才是你真正的家

624
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
and it always will be.

624
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
它永远是。

625
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,240
I know, Mum. I didn't mean that.

625
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,240
我知道，妈妈。我不是那个意思。

626
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
You're my boy.

626
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
你是我的男孩

627
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,400
Bye, son.

627
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,400
再见，儿子。

628
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
You've made a nice little
life for yourself down here.

628
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
你在
这里为自己创造了美好的小生活。

629
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,600
Thanks, Dad.

629
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,600
感谢爸爸。

630
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,200
Look after him for us.

630
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,200
替我们照顾他。

631
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
I will.

631
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
我会。

632
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,800
Bye. Bye, love.

632
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,800
再见。再见了，我的爱。

633
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,640
Right, let's get you in that bus.

633
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,640
好的，让我们送你上那辆巴士。

634
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
I love you.

634
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
我爱你。

635
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
I love you, too.

635
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
我也爱你。

636
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
Oi! There you are!

636
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
哎呀！你在这！

637
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,360
Hey, I'll have a word with you!

637
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,360
嘿，我跟你说句话！

638
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,640
It's about that...

638
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,640
是关于那个...

639
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,160
..that damn...

639
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,160
……该死的……

640
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,640
..salve you sent me!

640
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,640
..salve 你寄给我的！

641
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
To peace! To Mr Chamberlain!

641
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
为了和平！张伯伦先生！

642
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,000
Mr Chamberlain!Good man.

642
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,000
张伯伦先生！好人。

643
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Isn't it something?

643
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,960
不是东西吗？

644
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,920
You don't realise how much something
weighs on you till it's gone.

644
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,920
直到它消失，你才意识到有多少东西压在你身上。

645
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,160
I know exactly what you mean.

645
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,160
我确切地知道你的意思。

646
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,360
Now, look here, I think
it grossly unfair of you to

646
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,360
现在，看这里，我认为
你太不公平了

647
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,920
characterise my support as something
akin to the trials of Atlas.

647
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,920
将我的支持描述为
类似于 Atlas 的试验。

648
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
I only push you because I know you
could achieve

648
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
我只是推你，因为我知道你
可以做到

649
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,080
so much more than you do,
and if I didn't push you,

649
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,080
比你做的要多得多
如果我没有逼你

650
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,280
then you damn well wouldn't do
anything useful...

650
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,280
那么你他妈的不会做
任何有用的事情......

651
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,360
Here! Here he is!

651
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,360
这里！他在这里！

652
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,120
What do you think
of this one, then?

652
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,120
那你觉得
这个怎么样？

653
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,280
I cleaned the foots,

653
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,280
我洗了脚，

654
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,640
and all it took
was some of my shampoos.

654
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,640
只需要
我的一些洗发水。

655
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
I named him Roy.

655
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
我给他起名叫罗伊。

656
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,000
And to think you were going to do
away with him.

656
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,000
并认为你要
除掉他。

657
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,560
You were right, Mrs Donovan.

657
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,560
你说得对，多诺万夫人。

658
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
Your shampoos really seem to
have done the trick.

658
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
你的洗发水似乎真的
成功了。

659
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,080
Come here, you.

659
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,080
过来，你。

660
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,960
You needn't think I don't know what
you were up to.

660
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,960
你不必认为我不知道
你在做什么。

661
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,320
Come on, Roy. Come on, son.

661
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,320
来吧，罗伊。来吧，儿子。

662
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,880
How is everything?

662
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,880
一切还好吧？

663
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,120
Can I get you anything else?

663
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,120
我还能给你什么吗？

664
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
Any more drinks?

664
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
还有酒吗？

665
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,280
There was a stray
moping about the place.

665
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,280
这个地方有一种漫无目的的闷闷不乐。

666
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,160
I wanted to see
if I could do something for him

666
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,160
我想看看
我能不能为他做点什么

667
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,840
and help Mrs Donovan
at the same time.

667
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,840
同时帮助多诺万夫人
。

668
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,320
That sounds very kind of you.

668
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,320
听起来你真好。

669
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,880
Sorry, Siegfried,
you were saying something about me

669
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,880
对不起，齐格弗里德，
你说我的事

670
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,120
never doing anything useful.

670
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,120
从不做任何有用的事情。

671
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
I take it back.

671
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
我把它收回。

672
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,680
Now you're going to have
to give me some money.

672
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,680
现在你必须
给我一些钱。

673
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,520
Oh, I just bought you a drink. Don't
tell me you've guzzled it already.

673
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,520
哦，我刚给你买了一杯酒。别
告诉我你已经吃饱了。

674
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,880
So I can go back to college.
I've decided to re-sit parasitology.

674
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,880
所以我可以回到大学。
我决定重新参加寄生虫学。

675
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
I think veterinary practice might
be my calling after all.

675
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
我认为兽医可能
毕竟是我的职业。

676
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,880
Tristan, is it possible that you
got Cranford's salve

676
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,880
特里斯坦，你
有没有可能得到克兰福德的药膏

677
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,640
mixed up with a stool sample?

677
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,640
与粪便样本混在一起？

678
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,000
Just bumped into him
outside the Vulcan Inn.

678
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,000
刚好
在火神客栈外面撞到了他。

679
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,560
Said he started to rub
it in before he realised.

679
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,560
说他
在意识到之前就开始摩擦它。

680
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,800
No-one gets to be rude to Mrs H.

680
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,800
没有人会对 H 夫人无礼。

681
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,600
Quite right, well played.

681
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,600
说得对，打得不错。

682
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
Good boy.

682
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
好孩子。

683
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,120
Siegfried, I know I should've told
you about the job sooner,

683
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,120
齐格弗里德，我知道我应该
早点告诉你这份工作的事，

684
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,920
but I meant what I said.
I've learnt so much from you.

684
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,920
但我是认真的。
我从你那里学到了很多。

685
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,760
Yes, well, I couldn't help noticing
that both of you took rather a long

685
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,760
是的，我不禁注意到
你们俩花了很长时间

686
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,960
time fully to appreciate...

686
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,960
时间充分欣赏...

687
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,680
Oh, be quiet.

687
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,680
哦，安静。

688
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
Hear, you pair...

688
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
听说，你们配对...

689
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,840
..to your engagement

689
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,840
..你的订婚

690
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,760
and a very happy future together.

690
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,760
和一个非常幸福的未来。

691
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
Hear.

691
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
听到。

692
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,520
Thank you.

692
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,520
谢谢你。

693
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,800
Cheers!

693
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,800
干杯!

694
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
So, Helen,

694
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
所以，海伦，

695
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,520
do you think you'll be able to go
through with it this time?

695
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,520
你觉得
这次你能熬过去吗？

696
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,840
Tris!

696
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,840
三！

697
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
What, I'm only saying what we're
all thinking.

697
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
什么，我只是说我们都在
想什么。

698
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,040
Ow!

698
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,040
哦！
