Sweet little baby.

19
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:26,531
Scarf on...

20
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,740
Debbie, come in and eat
your breakfast, okay?

21
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:37,241
You're up next in the shower.

22
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,676
I want to play for a while.

23
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,945
Ask Carl if he'll come out
and get in the stroller.

24
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,180
The last time
you asked Carl to play,

25
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,681
you were locked in
the basement for half a day.

26
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:44,882
That was on purpose.

27
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,617
And we were playing
"Loser Goes to Gitmo."

28
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:49,320
Let's go! And put that
stroller back in the garbage.

29
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,968
Oh, man, yeah...
That's, uh, it's dead.

30
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,703
You sure?
Uh-huh.

31
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:06,971
The element's rusted out.

32
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,140
Anyone want to make some
Tollhouse cookies with me?

33
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,341
How much to replace it?

34
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,009
Uh, two bills used, four new.

35
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,177
Shit.

36
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,378
How about a pie?

37
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,847
I can get started on the crust.

38
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,181
Go take your shower.

39
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,118
I... wanna... make... pie.

40
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:21,619
You know what?
Hand me the obits.

41
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,021
Maybe, uh, we can scrounge
a dead person's water heater.

42
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:25,623
Thank you.

43
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,024
Ah, Mrs. Dombrowski.

44
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:28,793
Oh, the, uh, shaky neck lady?

45
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,962
I thought she drowned
a couple years ago.

46
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,364
No. Mrs. Goga
had the shaky neck,

47
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:35,833
and she drowned in her
own vomit last Easter.

48
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:38,336
No pie. Get in the shower.
I'm not saying it again.

49
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,537
Carl, no.

50
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,640
I went to school
with Kenny Dombrowski.

51
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,208
Think he had a crush on me.

52
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:45,676
Her wake's this morning.
Let's go.

53
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:46,844
Mm.
Up, up, up.

54
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,979
Can I come?

55
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:51,215
Um... no.

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,217
Debbie, what is
going on with you?

57
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,287
Nothing.

58
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:02,994
Oof. Shower.

59
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,128
After Debbie.

60
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,364
Towel and robe,
upstairs. Go.

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,368
And you need to learn how
to change your own diaper.

62
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,491
All right, it's
getting kind of windy.

63
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,627
Beautiful day for a party!

64
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,396
It's for kids, Frank!
No booze!

65
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,667
Son of a...

66
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,070
Oh...

67
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:48,606
How would you like
your eggs, sweetie?

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,641
Fluffy.
Oh.

69
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:55,479
They're having a party
across the street.

70
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:57,215
What, dear?

71
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,549
Across the street.

72
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,251
Some sort of a party for kids.

73
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,220
No booze.

74
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:04,555

78
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,192
Debbie?

79
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:42,860
What? What?
Stay focused, baby.

80
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:44,996
Are the Gallaghers
in our bathroom?

81
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,164
Oh, I know what you need, huh?

82
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,399

Uh-huh.

84
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,236

Yeah? Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,240
Went to see a lawyer.

89
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,909
It turns out I can't afford
to live somewhere else

90
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:34,111
and support you two.

91
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,579
Three.

92
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,081
Why can't you stay

93
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:38,582
He's got gangrene.

00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:41,585
Hey.

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,021
Why don't you get me a refill
there, huh, Karen, honey?

97
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,823
What, did you lose
your fucking legs?

98
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:48,159

Well, look at you, just letting
yourself into people's houses.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,501
Tall grande latte, two shots.

114
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:04,902
Sugar?
Absolutely.

115
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:08,372

Boys're out getting
a water heater,

118
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:12,543
Debbie's at the park,

119
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:15,946
Carl's out looking for small
defenseless pets to torture,

120
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,415
and Liam's down for a nap.

121
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:18,516
So...

122
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,683
No.

123
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:20,951
I'm up to my ass in housework.

124
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,186
That's why I'm taking you to

125
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,721
a long, deep, leisurely lunch.

126
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:24,622
Lunch?

127
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:25,589
It's a euphemism.

128
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,025
How quaint.

129
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,294
Or, would you like a Demon dog
and a quick fuck

130
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,796
over at the Sheridan?

131
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,030
Liam?
Get a sitter.

132
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,698
Costs too much.

133
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,400
How much?

134
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:37,735
At least 50 bucks.

135
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,505
You're not paying me
to fuck you.

136
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,073
No, I couldn't pay you enough.

137
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:49,613
Did you hear that?

138
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,415
No.

139
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,817
You didn't hear that?

140
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,418
You trying to
change the subject?

141
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,622
Liam?

142
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:01,125
He's too lazy to get out of his crib...
He just yells.

143
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,466
You stay with Liam.
Wait, wait, wait...

144
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,571
You take
the baby, I'll take the bat.

145
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,529
Debbie! Jesus!

146
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,364
Thought you went to the park.

147
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,099
I... came back.

148
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,901
Are you okay?

149
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:47,538
Katie Crasden's having a party.

150
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,139
Katie Crasden?

151
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,041
Two streets over.

152
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:53,210
And she...
didn't invite you?

153
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,478
She's only three.

154
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,113
What happened?

155
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:59,717
Well, I was just walking past,

156
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:01,385
and her dad, he...

157
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,154
Her dad did what?

158
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,892
He was laughing and playing
with them, and it just...

159
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,426
It wasn't fair.

160
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:12,129
What wasn't fair? What?

161
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,064
Everything.

162
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,633
So I, I, um...

163
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,803
I stole something.

164
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,338
Oh...

165
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:22,740
So nobody touched you?

166
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:23,874
What?

167
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,342
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

168
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:28,012
A bike.

169
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,516
Race car... Don't hit the train!

170
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,652
Debbie?

171
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,724
Who the hell is that?

172
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,566
We'll all be...
We'll just organize.

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,567
We'll be okay.

174
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,308
Just relax.

175
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,410
Oh, here we go!

176
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:02,880
No traffic tickets
to issue today?

177
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:07,885
No one to pull over for swinging
wide on a left-hand turn?

178
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,789
Or is this a supportive
"friend party" for a cop

179
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,525
who shot some poor fucker
wasn't even armed?!

180
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,260
Leave the people
around here alone.

181
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,361
They're good folks!

182
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:18,562
Who are the parents?

183
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,197
Let's go, people.
Out of the way.

184
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:21,198
Your child's missing?

185
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,600
Yeah. I need your names

186
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,668
and the name of the child.

187
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,204
Beth and Gary Casden.

188
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:29,907
- Mr. and Mrs. Casden, when is
the last time you saw...? - Uh, Ca-Casey.

189
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,241
It's been about an hour ago.

190
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:34,078
Okay, okay.
What was he wearing?

191
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,448
Debbie, why would you steal

192
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:40,351
a little girl?

193
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,919
Why would you steal a little boy

194
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,387
and dress him
like a little girl?

195
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:47,458
I wanted a girl,
but there weren't any.

196
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:49,593
Then back
to my initial question:

197
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,261
Why would you steal
a baby at all?

198
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,563
I miss Ginger.

199
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,098
What?
Who?

200
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,599
You took away Aunt Ginger!

201
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:56,834
Who is Aunt Ginger?

202
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,869
Somebody we borrowed
from V's nursing home.

203
00:10:58,903 --> 00:10:59,870
What?

204
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,105
She was my friend.

205
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,807
We have to take him back
right away, okay?

206
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:05,109
Where are his boy clothes?

207
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,311
I washed them.

208
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:10,814
Oh, my God, it shrunk!

209
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,149
You put it in the dryer?

210
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:14,418
That's what you do
after you wash something.

211
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:17,388
Um, we can put him in
some of Liam's clothes.

212
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,790
We can't bring
a missing kid back

213
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:20,991
wearing different clothes.

214
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,260
People will say
we did something to him.

215
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,762
Something bad.

216
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,899
Attention: This is...

217
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,300
Attention:
This is the Chicago...

218
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,102
Push, then...
I know what to push.

219
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:33,203
Attention!
This is the Chicago...

220
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:34,772
No. All right.
What are you doing?

221
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:36,473
Mike, we have to get
the information out.

222
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,442
Then let me drive.
No.

223
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,145
Look, I've been a cop
a lot longer than you.

224
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,681
You don't get to drive
and talk on the loudspeaker.

225
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,315
What, are you gonna
call your uncle?

226
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,818
Attention: This is the Chicago
Police Department.

227
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,787
We're looking for a missing
two-year-old...

228
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:52,589
So we're just
gonna wait out here?

229
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,091
He's a chain-smoking
pothead in

230
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,227
a stress-inducing situation;
he'll be out soon.

231
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:59,196
What are we supposed to say?

232
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,731
I don't know.
Just play it cool.

233
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:02,399
Play what cool?

234
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,169
Things people play cool.
Jesus, Ian!

235
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,971
You got your own cell?

236
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:11,008
No, some kid left it in the cafeteria.
Ah.

237
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,810
Hey, Kare.

238
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,411
Yeah, I'm at some
dead lady's house

239
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,480
trying to see if I can
score a water heater.

240
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:17,347
Meet me after?

241
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,550
<i>Hey, V?!</i>

242
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:21,118
I'm in the bathroom!

243
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,153
Hey, I'm in a bit of a jam.

244
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:24,621
Can you watch him
for 15 minutes?

245
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,890
Damn, Fi, you see I'm in
the middle of doing my...

246
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,559
Thanks.
Okay, sure.

247
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,062
Hey, Li...!

248
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,099
Who the fuck are you?

249
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,272
Oh, shit!

250
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:46,877
Hey, Fiona.

251
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,145
Hey, Tony.

252
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,013
You remember Steve?

253
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:51,749
Yeah. How's it going?

254
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,550
Uh, hear about the missing boy?

255
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:54,752
No. What happened?

256
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,520
Got taken from a front yard
birthday party.

257
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,722
Do they think he might have
just wandered off?

258
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,157
We've got everybody out looking:

259
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,860
choppers, SWAT, couple dozen
extra units, Amber alerts.

260
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:04,895
Wow. Really.

261
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,264
We're gonna catch the bastard
that took little Casey

262
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,166
and chop his pedophile nuts off.

263
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:18,408
Less than two hours ago, a young
boy, only two years of age,

264
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,511
was abducted
from his front yard.

265
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:21,779
You see this?

266
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,248
This is what happens
when the world goes crazy.

267
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:26,250
People steal kids.

268
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:29,153
And Rastafarians
are allowed to roam free.

269
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,988
I don't mean real Rastafarians.

270
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:33,924
I mean Rastaman Goldberg's
from Lake Forest

271
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,494
with rich parents who get
dropped off in Town Cars

272
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,930
to go beg for money on
the streets.

273
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,131
What a load of crap.

274
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,266
Obamacare, my ass!

275
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,168
What the news people
don't tell you?

276
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:48,372
They love it
when kids get stolen.

277
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,340
They're just looking
for a good story

278
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,709
to saturate our airwaves with.

279
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:55,179
And why are all
the news ladies Chinese?

280
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,748
They should stick
to what they know:

281
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:03,120
railroads... sushi...dim sum.

282
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,055
Frank, guess what.

283
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,226
I made muffins using
a Bundt cake batter.

284
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,929
I didn't even need
to add another egg.

285
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,665
Hi, sweetie.

286
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:15,666
The shithead gone?

287
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,034
He just left for work.

288
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,101
I'm still here.

289
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:20,037
Just getting my coat.

290
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:22,406
I just had some
delicious penii.

291
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,540
What?

292
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,709
Little Casey up the street?
Gone missing

293
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,878
right from his own backyard.

294
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:30,047
Oh, that's terrible.

295
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,885
You missed...

296
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:42,426
...Casey is
a loving and kind child...

297
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,901
Mm...!

298
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:54,037
It was less than that!

299
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:55,572
My husband Mark
said that he saw...

300
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,140
I know you're
all concerned, okay? I know.

301
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,243
Everybody calm down...
I'll get to all of you, okay?

302
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,677
Uh, you first, okay?
All right. We...

303
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:03,614
I wasn't sure what size,
so bought three just in case.

304
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,750
Oh, slow down. Stop the car!
What?

305
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:07,885
Hey! Hey!

306
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,287
Hey, almost new.

307
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,588
Debbie stole a baby...
We have to figure out

308
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:12,589
how to return it.

309
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:13,891
- Debbie stole a baby?
- Yeah.

310
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:14,958
Why?

311
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,326
It's Debbie.

312
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,028
I did not see that coming.

313
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,030
Um... can't we
just give it back?

314
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:22,266
I wish we could.
It's too late now.

315
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Wow.

316
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:24,635
Find Carl and get home now.

317
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:27,004
Yeah.

318
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,945
We're looking
for a missing boy named Casey.

319
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,114
Last seen wearing
a Superman costume.

320
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:38,348
Two years old.

321
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,884
Any information would be
greatly appreciated.

322
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,952
No questions asked.

323
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,021
Why the fuck wouldn't
we ask questions?

324
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:46,323
Because we want people
to feel safe.

325
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:49,326
How do you find out what happened
if you don't ask questions?

326
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,727
You understand
the premise, right?

327
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:52,496
People feel safe,
they give information,

328
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,864
we find the kid.

329
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:56,066
Safe, my ass.
I'm asking questions.

330
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,701
Okay, yeah.
I'm gonna ask fucking questions.

331
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,469
That's what you do. Go ahead.
Yeah, sure.

332
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,071
You do what you want to do.

333
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:02,439
Casey Casden, last seen

334
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,074
...wearing a Superman costume...

335
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,977
Kev, stop!

336
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,679
What's Liam doing here?

337
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,414
It's not Liam.

338
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,783
Who the hell is this?!
I don't know.

339
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,217
Fiona dropped him off.

340
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,019
Attention, all residents.

341
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,587
There is a child still missing.

342
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:18,722
Approximately two years of age,

343
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:21,525
and wearing a Superman costume.

344
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,393
If you've seen this boy...
Fucking Gallaghers.

345
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:26,196
When I was a kid, we could go
to a birthday party

346
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,700
and our parents wouldn't worry
that we were gonna get stolen

347
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,636
out of the front yard
by some perv.

348
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,105
That's when America had values.

349
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,474
Before Wal-Mart and Dukakis,

350
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:40,043
peanut butter and jelly in one jar.

351
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,312
You know, you're too young
to remember this,

352
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:44,982
but there was a time when
policemen were respected,

353
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:47,584
when young men wanted
to fight for their country.

354
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:49,252
When you could go vote twice

355
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,388
for Mayor Daley,
down at the 11th Ward.

356
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:54,725
Before some liberal pricks
elected a Muslim

357
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,593
who isn't even American?

358
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:58,462
<i>We need to get</i>

359
00:16:58,496 --> 00:16:59,997
your stories straight
for the police.

360
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,431
Why did you take the boy?

361
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,134
He was crying for his mom,
and his mom wasn't around.

362
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,702
Did you try to find his mom?

363
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,472
No, he was crying and
nobody cared, so I took him.

364
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,874
You can't say that! What's wrong with you?!
Hey, Fi!

365
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,609
You know what, Debs?

366
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,511
Was he inside or outside
of the yard

367
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,579
when you grabbed him?

368
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:16,613
Inside.

369
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,750
Well, okay, so how'd
you get him out?

370
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,052
I waved a Snickers bar at him.

371
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,253
Did anybody see you?

372
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,288
I don't think so.
We just ran.

373
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:27,124
That wasn't suspicious.

374
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:28,692
So you were running
down the street...

375
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:29,693
I used a stroller.

376
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:30,694
What stroller?

377
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,728
Liam's old one.

378
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,163
The one I told you
to throw out?

379
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,398
I fixed it.

380
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,733
For emergencies.

381
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,071
Open up! Hurry!

382
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,806
Oh, shit.

383
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,776
What in the hell is going on?

384
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,177
Is this that missing kid?

385
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,979
Debbie stole him.
And now we have to figure out

386
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,281
how to give him back without
getting her 36 months in juvie.

387
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,449
Why in the world
would she steal...

388
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,787
There must be
a couple hundred cops out there.

389
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,156
I know. I'm so sorry.

390
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,490
Debs, will you watch him
for a second?

391
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,259
Come with us.

392
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,094
Casey, we're gonna play
a couple games, okay?

393
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,263
I'm not sure what's
going on with her.

394
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:09,766
Oh, maybe it's 'cause your mom
bailed and Frank's a big drunk.

395
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,968
Oh, what, I'm asshole now?
She's the one who stole a baby.

396
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,171
All right, look, she
obviously planned it.

397
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:16,573
I mean, she took a stroller out
of the garbage and she fixed it.

398
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,341
All right, hey, Debbie's
still is a little kid.

399
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:20,210
Worst thing that happens
is she gets some help.

400
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:21,812
Help?
What kind of help?

401
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,613
She stole a baby.
She's not crazy.

402
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:26,349
She just sort of accidentally took a kid.
Not if she lured

403
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,752
him out of the yard
with a candy bar.

404
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:29,820
What are you suggesting?

405
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,321
Some kind or professional...

406
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,489
What, a shrink?

407
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:33,690
Gallaghers do not do therapy.

408
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,192
We're looking for

409
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:36,393
a missing two-year-old boy...
Casey Casden.

410
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:39,629
He was last seen wearing
a Superman costume.

411
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,331
If you have any information,
call 911.

412
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:43,733
Lip, we need a plan to get
that boy back to his family

413
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:46,069
or Family Services is
gonna have a field day.

414
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:47,337
Family Services?

415
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,239
If they find out Frank's moved,

416
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:50,774
they'll take the kids.

417
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:51,842
Split 'em up.

418
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,310
Remember what happened
last time?

419
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,586
Shit.
Exactly.

420
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,288
All right, Carl, you know
that pay phone that's outside

421
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,756
of the Kash and Grab?

422
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,658
Yeah.
All right, I want you to get

423
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,393
on your bike,
go to the pay phone,

424
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,963
call the police, tell them
that you saw a little boy

425
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,732
walking down Southport Avenue
at 2:45, okay?

426
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,434
Why should I?
Want to be in

427
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:18,602
a children's home
until you're 18?

428
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,037
Group home on Union has
a climbing wall.

429
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,038
Carl...

430
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,373
I don't have a bike.

431
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:24,941
Wire cutter's
in the junk drawer.

432
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,521
What...?

433
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,723
Steve, Fiona,
you guys have to get Debs

434
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:41,091
to take that kid back.

435
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,893
I don't know that
I can make that happen.

436
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,728
Fiona, you have to,
or else we're all fucked.

437
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,696
Okay.

438
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:48,565
Why do I have to do it?

439
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,966
Because we've already
told the police

440
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,468
we don't know
anything about it.

441
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,569
I'm not a good liar.

442
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:53,637
You can do this.

443
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,205
I'm not!
You always say so!

444
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,941
Oh, hey, you know what, Debs?
It's been hours,

445
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,243
and Casey's parents are probably
really worried about him.

446
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:03,346
You remember that pie
you wanted to make?

447
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:04,714
Let's do that tonight.

448
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,051
What do I have to do?

449
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,620
I saw a little boy walking down
Southport Avenue

450
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:11,922
at, like, 2:45.

451
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:14,524
2:45?
Yeah, 2:45!

452
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,992
Asshole.

453
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:17,260
Got a sighting.

454
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,095
Kid saw the boy walking
down Southport.

455
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,897
DEBBIE:<i>I was walking up</i>
<i>Southport Avenue</i>

456
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,165
when I saw little Casey.

457
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,667
Nah...
You didn't know his name.

458
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,235
A little boy.

459
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,269
Yeah.
All alone.

460
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:27,437
All alone...

461
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:28,438
and crying.

462
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:29,773
I asked her where her mom went.

463
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,007
Not her.

464
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,242
Oh, um, I asked him

465
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:33,743
where his mom was.

466
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,178
And she didn't know.

467
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:38,114
He seemed upset,
so I gave him some chocolate.

468
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,816
Good, Debs.
You're doing great.

469
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,851
<i>All right, Veronica,</i>
<i>I want you to go</i>

470
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,220
to the cleaners,
ask Mrs. Bergdoll

471
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:44,988
to use the phone in the back.

472
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:47,123
That woman's a cold bitch.
I've got something for that, okay?

473
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,992
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

474
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:50,827
Hey, Mrs. B., can I use

475
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,529
your phone really quick?

476
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,531
I got some green bud
for your glaucoma.

477
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:56,600
Mm...!

478
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:58,201
I saw a little boy
with a Superman

479
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,669
suit walking down Grand Avenue.

480
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,071
What time was that?

481
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,305
About 15 minutes ago.

482
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,374
And I thought,
maybe this is the little boy

483
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:05,275
everyone's been talking about.

484
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,443
I'm sorry...

485
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:07,577
A Spider-Man suit?

486
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,045
I didn't say Spider-Man;
I said Superman.

487
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,648
He had a cape and he was walking
with a little girl.

488
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:13,984
Can you describe the...
Asshole.

489
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,987
<i>So I went to the phone</i>
<i>outside Connie's Pizza</i>

490
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,521
<i>and called the police.</i>

491
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:21,524
<i>But I couldn't use the phone,</i>
<i>because it was broken.</i>

492
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,831
And did you try
to call anyone else?

493
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,032
Yes, I did.

494
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,800
Oh. Right.

495
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,335
I was standing on the street,

496
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,204
and I asked people
who were passing

497
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,639
if I could use their phone.

498
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:38,308
I said it was an emergency,
but no one listened.

499
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:41,778
I don't know if it was
because I was young or...

500
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:43,146
Oh!

501
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,514
Poor!

502
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,994
Ha-ha-ha-ho.

503
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:05,168
Okay, let's see...

504
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,009
Frank?!

505
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:16,079
Oh... what am I gonna do?

506
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,350
Stop?

507
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:38,746
Hi, Frank.
Shit!

508
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:40,511
Sorry! Karen!

509
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:41,879
I thought you were gone.

510
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:43,214
Frank?

511
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,548
Pass me a towel?

512
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,624
You got it all wet.

513
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,193
A hand towel is fine.

514
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:58,496
And don't throw it, please.

515
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:21,385
Casey!

516
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,222
Kev, what time you
going to work today?

517
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,658
Uh, I go in at 6:00.
You're going in early.

518
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,427
<i>You should go in,</i>
<i>tell them you saw</i>

519
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:30,928
<i>a little boy</i>
<i>in a Superman costume</i>

520
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:32,263
<i>walking down Grand Avenue.</i>

521
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:34,699
What are you doing here?
You're not on till 6:00.

522
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,767
But I'm here now;
what's the harm?

523
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:38,235
Gary! How you doin', man?
Hey!

524
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,071
Another Old Style?
Yep.

525
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:41,339
Gosh, you know what?

526
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:44,709
I am feeling nostaglic today.

527
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,046
Did you hear what I said?

528
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:50,548
Said I was feeling nostalgic.

529
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,849
What's nostalgic?

530
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:53,217
Well, I'm glad you asked.

531
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:55,720
I was walking to work,
and I saw this cute little kid

532
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:57,555
wearing a Superman costume.

533
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,457
You know,
with the cape and everything?

534
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:01,225
Takes you back.
He was a cute kid.

535
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:06,297
Yeah, Superman costume.

536
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,598
Cute little kid.

537
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:09,934
A little kid in a
Superman costume?

538
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:11,135
Superman costume.
Sandy hair.

539
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,203
That's the little boy
that's missing.

540
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:13,404
Where did you see him?

541
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,373
On Grand. I just passed him,
like, five minutes ago.

542
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:17,575
Well, we have to
call that in, Kev.

543
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,076
Yes, we do!

544
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,613
Hey, how's my
favorite lady doing?

545
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:24,815
Well, she'll be better when her
Powerball numbers come up,

546
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,650
and Allied Shippers can
kiss her fine black ass.

547
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:30,287
Yeah, I got a good feeling on that one.
You say that every week.

548
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,856
Four vodka tonics?

549
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,957
No, only three today.

550
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:34,392
Marilyn wants a virgin colada.

551
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,827
She blacked out last night,
so she a little nervous.

552
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:41,999
No, no, no, no, if I can't buy
my girlfriend's mom drinks,

553
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:44,301
what good am I?
No damn good.

554
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,337
That's right.
Can I get these for you?

555
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,638
No. I got 'em.

556
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,414
Ladies, how you doing?

557
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,048
I'm just gonna grab
these glasses... that okay?

558
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,784
You can grab anything
of mine you like.

559
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:01,786
What's your name?
Kev.

560
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,723
Kev. That's nice and short
and easy to whisper, like...

561
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,292
Do it again, Kev.

562
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:10,828
Uh-huh... yeah...

563
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,530
Mr. Barkeep...

564
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:14,698
a large boilermaker.

565
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:18,469
And keep 'em comin'.

566
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,573
Hey, did you bring in the water
heater from the back porch?

567
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:24,542
No.
Well, it's not on the porch.

568
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:26,377
Seriously.

569
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:34,385
Bunch of fucking animals.

570
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,986
Steve, Debbie, Liam,
we gotta go.

571
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:37,588
Fiona, you got
Casey, all right?

572
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:39,223
I'll see you at Sheila's after.

573
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,559
Hey, don't worry,
she's gonna do great.

574
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,360
She doesn't even seem sorry.

575
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:45,229
Nah, she is.
She's just a kid.

576
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:47,198
She can't tell lies.
She never could.

577
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,567
We're all going to jail.

578
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,170
Why can't I just
take Casey back now?

579
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,507
We can't let anybody see you,
with Casey, leaving our house.

580
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,709
Look, Fiona is gonna take
Casey to the rendezvous spot.

581
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:00,144
She'll give him to you and then

582
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:02,012
you'll take him back
to his house from there.

583
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:03,481
Otherwise, the plan won't work.

584
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:05,282
Fiona is gonna go to Shiela's,

585
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:07,284
to make sure she has an alibi.

586
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,019
I don't think I can do this.

587
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:11,355
Yeah, you're gonna
be great, Debs.

588
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:14,558
Just... don't fuck it up.

589
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,498
Hey, Debs...

590
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:21,465
Yeah?

591
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,967
Do you know why doctors,

592
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,135
lawyers and nurses
are great liars?

593
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,470
No.

594
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:28,038
Because they lie
to help people.

595
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:29,673
Like, a doctor wouldn't
tell a sick patient,

596
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,342
"Too bad, you're gonna die."

597
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:33,477
He would say, "We're doing
everything we can," wouldn't he?

598
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:35,713
Yeah...

599
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:37,982
So, pretend you're
being a doctor today,

600
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:40,150
and tell a doctor's
kind of lie.

601
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:41,685
Can you be a doctor for me?

602
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,355
Can I be a nurse?

603
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:46,357
That's my girl.

604
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:51,562
In just a moment,
we will take you live

605
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:53,030
to the scene of the crime,

606
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:55,633
with our field correspondent
Charles Catino.

607
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,968
But first,
if you have any information

608
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:00,137
regarding the whereabouts
of Casey Casden,

609
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:03,107
please call the number
at the bottom of your screen.

610
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:04,041
Charles, are you there?

611
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,214
Shots on me!

612
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:14,018
You are soaking wet!

613
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:27,531
Uh, so... fixing up
the basement.

614
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:28,899
Mm-hmm. Gonna try.

615
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:31,402
Sheetrock that corner
space for my bed.

616
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:34,171
The other half's already
paneled, so I'm good there.

617
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,007
Got a spot for the sink;
toilet's already in.

618
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:41,845
So, just run some cable for the
flat-screen, and I'm all set.

619
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,049
So...

620
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,118
that Sheila,
she's something, huh?

621
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:50,688
That's one way to put it.

622
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,725
Does your ass
ever stop hurting?

623
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,728
No.

624
00:27:57,762 --> 00:27:59,263
Advil's your best bet.

625
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:01,398
Helps with the inflammation.

626
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,535
Hey, Kev.

627
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:06,136
Hey.
You see my friend?

628
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:09,039
I know she acts like she hits
on everyone, but she's doesn't.

629
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:11,241
She likes you.

630
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,143
Well, I'm flattered,
but I can't.

631
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,245
Kev, you wanna get to it?

632
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,081
Oh, come on, what can
one little drink hurt?

633
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:18,115
Um, uh...

634
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:20,651
Yeah... Really, no.

635
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,220
Look, she doesn't care
if you have a girlfriend.

636
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:25,122
Neither do I.

637
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:28,292
Can you handle two?

638
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,363
What, the both of you?

639
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,034
Uh, I can't, really.

640
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:40,404
Actually, um...
I'm getting married.

641
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:42,973
What-What-What's that, now?
Married?!

642
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:44,942
No, no, no, Frank...
Frank, can I get you a shot?

643
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:45,943
Veronica?

644
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:46,877
Frank, it...

645
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:47,978
Hey, Jess!

646
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:49,747
Roll out the champagne!

647
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:51,548
Our boy here is getting hitched!

648
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,583
What?!

649
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,251
Kev is marrying Veronica!

650
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,987
Frank!
Carol! Carol!

651
00:28:57,022 --> 00:28:58,188
Carol, come here!

652
00:28:58,223 --> 00:28:59,590
No, no, Frank... Frank...
Carol, where are you?

653
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:01,325
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, Fr...

654
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,793
Carol!
No, no, no, no, no! Frank!

655
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,895
Kev's making an honest woman
out of your daughter!

656
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,897
You what?!
Yeah!

657
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:07,998
Oh, my God!

658
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,400
And to think I was
over there, drinking,

659
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:10,968
worried about that missing boy.

660
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:13,303
Who gives a shit about that now?
Hey!

661
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:16,006
My daughter's getting married!
Kev's getting married to Veronica!

662
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:20,844
And I got the oldest
bottle of Asti Spumanti!

663
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:23,180
Oh!

664
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:27,151
You have made me... the
happiest woman in the world.

665
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:28,485
I'm gonna go call Veronica.

666
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,486
Wait, wait! No.

667
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:30,754
She'll want to call you.

668
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:32,122
You don't want
to ruin the surprise.

669
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:33,524
Okay, everybody,

670
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,159
drinks on the house!

671
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:39,396
Here you go...
one for the mama!

672
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,597
There you go!

673
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:42,499
All right, one for the big daddy...
Now for the mama.

674
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,301
There we go!

675
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,502
Yeah!

676
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:15,866
Fiona Gallagher?!

677
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,969
Yeah. Yeah, what about her?

678
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:20,070
Nothing.

679
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:21,171
Good.

680
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,378
You really wanna
hook up with her?

681
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:29,847
A lot of kids over there, man.

682
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:31,882
You're kidding, right?

683
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,317
Your marriage only
lasted six weeks.

684
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:34,318
Seven.

685
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:35,652
And she wound up
with the house.

686
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:37,988
My car's paid off!

687
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:40,991
You giving me advice
is ridiculous.

688
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:02,079
Fiona...

689
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:05,449
What a pleasant surprise.

690
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,219
So they haven't found him yet?

691
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:12,422
I can't stop thinking about

692
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:15,025
what his parents
must be going through.

693
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,294
I know.

694
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,966
Do you want a drink?

695
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,135
I've got a lot of booze.

696
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,470
No mixers.

697
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,105
Cup of coffee would be great.

698
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,543
Why don't I make it?

699
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,647
Oh, don't mind me.

700
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:40,884
I accidentally took three
of my pills instead of one.

701
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,089
Hey, wait a second...

702
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:48,759
Hiya, mister.

703
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:50,294
Hey, there.

704
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:55,432
How about giving me a big hug?

705
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:06,009
I'm gonna blush,
and then they'll know!

706
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:07,744
I can't be a nurse.
I'm not patient.

707
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,046
I hate bedpans.

708
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,514
I can't walk in clogs.

709
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:12,850
And let's face it,
I'm too small!

710
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,221
Peek-a-boo!

711
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,759
Peek-a-boo...
Oh, my God!

712
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,199
Mommy!

713
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,968
Casey's back!

714
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,536
I don't believe it!

715
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,104
Is it him?
Mommy!

716
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,639
It is!

717
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:36,673
He's back.

718
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:42,246
My baby!

719
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,316
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick about you!

720
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:47,684
Where did you find him?

721
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,353
He was walking all by himself.

722
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:50,921
I didn't know where he lived.

723
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:52,189
Thank you.
You're an angel.

724
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,323
I don't, I don't...

725
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,359
I don't know how to thank you.

726
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:56,994
Uh, here, just, uh...

727
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,996
Here, take-take all...
Take it.

728
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,597
Take all of it.
Just take everything.

729
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:04,768
Thank you.
Thank you.

730
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:06,370
I told you we'd find him.

731
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,373
My Debbie found him!
A Gallagher saved the day!

732
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:10,874
You bunch of losers.

733
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:14,878
Bye!

734
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:20,417
That's Deb's.

735
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:23,520
No, I-I'm just helping her.

736
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:27,391
Hey! You're on my hand.
You're...

737
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:31,461
All right, I am your father.

738
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:33,630
Hey, Deb. Good job.

739
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:35,732
Fiona, you want to come
with us, please?

740
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:36,967
Where?

741
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,435
We need to take Deb
to the station.

742
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:40,070
What for?

743
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:41,905
We need to take a statement.

744
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,341
Well, she-she found him.

745
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,976
I mean, isn't that enough?

746
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,678
We need a statement.

747
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:49,279
You can stay with her.

748
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:52,749
Nurse Debbie can handle it.

749
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:54,685
What I'm trying to tell you is

750
00:33:54,719 --> 00:34:01,158
that I have never seen
her love anybody...

751
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:03,593
I mean, anybody...

752
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:08,165
Oh no...
No...Anybody as much as she loves you.

753
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,232
For real?

754
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,267
I'm for real.

755
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:12,703
Including her daddy.

756
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,504
No!
Mm-hmm.

757
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:16,173
Come on.

758
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:21,244
Ooh, and honey,
she love him... Mm!

759
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:25,048
Whoo! Mm-mmm.

760
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:30,153
Oh, shit.

761
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:40,030
V!

762
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,965
V!

763
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:46,803
V!

764
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,439
V!

765
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:51,675
Can you hear me?

766
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,176
I need to speak
to Veronica Fisher.

767
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,012
What the hell?!

768
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,516
What are you doing?

769
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,618
I'm here to tell you something.

770
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:04,988
I mean, I need
to ask you something.

771
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,524
How did you get so drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

772
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:15,399
Veronica Fisher, will you do me
the honor of being my wife?

773
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:18,368
Yes! Yeah!

774
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,105
I love you, baby.

775
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,107
I love you!

776
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,110
I first saw him on Southport.

777
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:29,679
He caught my eye because my baby
brother Liam loves Superman.

778
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:30,714
After I noticed

779
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,716
he was alone, I took his hand.

780
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,518
He's a very good walker

781
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:36,019
and very well-manned
for a toddler.

782
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:38,789
I thought for sure someone
would let me use their phone.

783
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:41,391
You know, I'm just so shocked
at the lack of humanity.

784
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:42,659
Yes, I'd love a cookie.

785
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:45,495
I remember Grand Avenue
from my Aunt Ginger.

786
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,963
Do they require you

787
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:50,033
to wear a jacket and tie
or is that your choice?

788
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,435
I find it very fetching!

789
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:07,551
Big day.

790
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,386
Yeah.

791
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,620
Happy ending.

792
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,091
Yep.

793
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:17,994
You missed
a good pot roast last week.

794
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:20,831
My mom really
pulled out all the stops.

795
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:24,734
Yeah...

796
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,837
I'm sorry about that.

797
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,248
That's so great

798
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,317
about Debbie finding
that little Casey.

799
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:41,585
Yeah, I know.

800
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,021
He was lucky it was her
and not some crazy fucker.

801
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:46,890
I like your new jeans.

802
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,258
Oh, thanks.

803
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,627
They didn't cheer me up
as much as I'd hoped.

804
00:36:50,661 --> 00:36:51,962
My house is so fucking weird.

805
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,597
I wish I'd been kidnapped.

806
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,532
Is it that bad?

807
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,400
Yeah. You should have
seen him at breakfast.

808
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:59,736
I can't imagine what dinners are
gonna be like.

809
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,272
And, in fact, as soon as he gets
down to the bottom,

810
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,341
I look back and there are
all these people behind us...

811
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,476
Yes.
...And I start yelling, "Go back! Go back!"

812
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:08,378
Why?

813
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:09,846
Because he stepped
off of the thing,

814
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,481
and he just stopped there.

815
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:13,316
And there are all
of these people...

816
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:14,451
Oh, thank you.

817
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:17,687
You know, your house is
Frank's wet dream.

818
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:20,624
Never gonna get him out.

819
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,360
Wanna sneak into my backyard

820
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:25,862
and do it on the tire swing?

821
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:27,664
Lip?

822
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,299
Wait, I'm thinking.

823
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,335
Well, I guess sometimes
there are happy endings.

824
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,037
Casey Casden, the little boy
who disappeared

825
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:35,739
from his own front yard
earlier today

826
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:39,910
has been delivered home
safe and sound.

827
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,778
Oh, thank you, Lisa.
That is indeed great, great...

828
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:42,779
Fiona!

829
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,482
♪ ♪

830
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,389
What's up?

831
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,759
Um, for Debbie.

832
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,130
Okay. Mm-hmm.

833
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:06,636
Hey, Debs, look
what Steve bought.

834
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,804
Oh, my God!

835
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,339
For me?

836
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,574
Absolutely.

837
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:12,309
For doing
such a great job today.

838
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:13,443
Thank you!

839
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:14,477
What you gonna name her?

840
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:16,680
Gin-Gin.

841
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:18,515
After Aunt Ginger.

842
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,317
Let's go up to my room.
We can play!

843
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,155
Oh, Gin-Gin,
you're so funny.

844
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,659
Oh, Gin-Gin...

845
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:43,707
Kevin, wake up.

846
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,742
It's time to get drunk again.

847
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,981
$690, $700,

848
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:55,585
$710, $715 exactly.

849
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:02,892
Hmm... Ah.

850
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,404
Thanks for buying
her that doll.

851
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,307
No. Not a problem.

852
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:20,610
You know what would
feel great right now?

853
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:23,346
Hmm?
A long, hot shower.

854
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:25,382
I'll wash your back.

855
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:33,823
Shit.

856
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:35,859
No hot water.

857
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,864
You really are beautiful.

858
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:49,673
I hope I'm not
fucking up the kids.

859
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,677
Fiona!

860
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,115
Fiona, where are you?

861
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:02,986
Here.

862
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,888
Fiona!

863
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,756
Yeah!

864
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,224
Mommy!

865
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:12,429
What the hell?
Champagne?

866
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,764
I'm getting married.

867
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:16,833
Oh, my God!

868
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,584
She's great.

869
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:36,319
Yeah, man.

870
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:37,721
She's a good egg.

871
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:39,723
She deserves it.

872
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:42,325
Yeah, but does she
deserve you, you bastard?

873
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:46,763
No. Nobody does.

874
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,285
Take the Advil now.

875
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,554
You want to stay
ahead of the pain.

876
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,374
Penny for your thoughts.

877
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:32,742
Really, Grandma?

878
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:34,110
I know.

879
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:37,547
I'm a 60-year-old lady
with the vaj of a newborn.

880
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,587
You know I love you
guys, right, Kev?

881
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:46,656
I couldn't raise these
kids without you and V.

882
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,525
I know they borrow
your shit all the time.

883
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,793
I'm sorry.
I know it's lame.

884
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:52,128
But thanks.

885
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:54,197
I don't know how I'd do it
without you guys.

886
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,632
And I just love you so much.

887
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,300
I'm just so happy for you both.

888
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:58,601
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:00,503
You know that Jagermeister
really makes you chatty.

890
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:02,505
Right? You know that?

891
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:06,876
Look at V.

892
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:09,746
Isn't she beautiful?

893
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,116
Yeah... She sure is.

894
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,189
What the hell is that?

895
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:25,261
Debbie?

896
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:34,170
It's our new water heater.

897
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:35,338
I got it on sale.

898
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:38,575
And free delivery.

899
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,243
He said because I'm a hero.

900
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,579
You are my girl!

901
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,581
Oh, man.

902
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:47,750
You're gonna go to the back and
you're gonna make a sharp left.

903
00:42:47,785 --> 00:42:49,419
And install it in the kitchen.

904
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:52,288
Take it in the kitchen.
Go straight down.

905
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:57,193
By the way, I
call the first hot shower.

906
00:42:57,228 --> 00:42:59,562
That was something, huh?

907
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:01,297
Yeah.

908
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,869
You know, for a guy
who just got engaged,

909
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,037
you don't seem very happy
to be getting married.

910
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:14,110
That's 'cause
I'm already married.

911
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:01,958
Debs, you've got
to get ready for school.

912
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:05,161
I can't go to school.

913
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:07,130
Why not?

914
00:44:07,164 --> 00:44:12,268
Gin-Gin had me up half the night
with diarrhea.

915
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:31,560
