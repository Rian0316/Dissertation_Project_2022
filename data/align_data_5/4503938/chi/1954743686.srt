00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:04,837
小姐

我必须道歉
I have to apologize.

3

不必跟我道歉 但我肯定阿曼门诺派要生气了
Well, not to me, but I'm sure the Amish are pissed

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,741
{\an8}北美洲戒律严谨的宗教团体

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,312
因为你让他们的装束显得像基佬
that you're gaying up their look.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,848
我不够钱给小费
I don't have enough money for the tip.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,217
真奇怪 餐厅的辣椒没干掉你
Weird. You survive the diner chili,

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,920
你却死在了服务员手里!
and it's the waitress that kills you!

9
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,290
但我能以另一种方式给小费 我是个灵媒
But I can tip another way. I'm a psychic.

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,591
所以 你已经知道
So, uh, you already know

11
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,194
你的尸体能在何处找到
where they're gonna find your body.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,296
哦 拜托 我会死于一次大桥坍塌
Oh, please. I die in a bridge collapse

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,498
这事跟你没有关系
you have nothing to do with.

14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,234
我能告诉你 你的未来
I can tell you your future.

15
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,895
哈! 你错了 我没有未来
Ha! You're wrong. I don't have one.

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,073
看见坐在那个位置的家伙没?
See the guy in the booth over there?

17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,809
杰瑞德·莱托·随他去?
Jared "Leto Himself Go"?

18
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,809
{\an8}杰瑞德·莱托 摇滚歌手 一头长发

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,912
他提出给我预示未来以作小费

20
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,573
哈! 你都没有未来
Ha! You don't have one.

21
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,219
小姐 让我看看你的掌心
Miss, let me read your palm.

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,256
先生 这时候过来可不是个好主意
Sir, coming over here right now is not a good idea.

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,491
我们不喜欢陌生人不给小费
We don't like to be stiffed by strangers.

24
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,161
六个月后也许可以 但现在还不行
In six months, maybe, but we're not there yet.

25
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,296
我是正规的灵媒
I'm a legit psychic.

26
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,131
我曾预言当时机到了
I predicted long hair was coming back

27
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,401
我的头发就会长到这个长度
in time to have long hair when it did.

28
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,702
好吧 你可以
Okay. You can read my palm.

29
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,304
我想要听到好消息
I could use some good news.

30
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,841
我本该抹护手霜的... 抱歉
I could also use some hand moisturizer... sorry.

31
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,210
我看到两个M?
I see two Ms?

32
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,679
你个贱人! 你一直私藏M&M's巧克力豆吗?
You bitch! Have you been holding out on M&M's?

33
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,818
哦! 是不是指男模特?
Ooh! Is it the male model

34
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,053
我在处理他的事
I'm managing

35

其实... 我看见一个小败笔
Actually... I see a small failure.

吃一点点酥皮的碎渣?

Caroline不让我吃任何东西
Caroline won't let me eat anything

47
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,199
因为我要拍写真大片

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,967
快点!
Hurry!

49
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,203
不要咀嚼 不要品味 直接吞
No chewing, no enjoying. Just swallow.

50
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:26,038
吐出来!
Spit that out!

我说了 吐出来!
I said spit that out!

53
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:32,711
你现在是模特了! 真丢脸!
You're a model now! Shame on you!

54
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,046
贱人 他要饿死了
Bitch, he's starving.

55
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,816
他没吃吧 对吗?
He's not eating, is he?

56
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:39,551
我不希望一个棉花糖一样的男人
I don't want the Stay Puft Marshmallow man

57
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:42,888
出现在我女朋友的写真集里

58
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,290
我从周二开始就没吃过东西!

59
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,492
今早 他试图吞下他的牙膏
This morning, he tried to swallow his toothpaste,

60
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,461
幸好被我阻止了
but I was right there to stop him.

61
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,929
干得好 亲爱的
Good, honey.

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,864
正因你冷血无情  才让我决定
That kind of heartlessness is why I've decided

63
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,800
让你担任"糕潮"新热门地段的
to make you the manager of our hot new location

64
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,967
经理
of the High.

65
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,471
天啊! 太令人激动了!
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!

66
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,940
终于有人看到了我的潜力
Someone's finally realizing my full potential,

67
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:04,209
而且那个人不是我!
and it's not me!

68
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,711
我能让Max做糕点主厨吗?
Will I be able to make Max head pastry chef?

69
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,447
还有 这个新地段在哪儿?
And where is this new location?

70
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,249
这一切都是秘密
Well, right now, everything's under wraps

71
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,385
而我六个月前是这种表情
the way my face was six months ago.

72
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,787
作为经理 你可以雇用你自己的员工
But as manager, you can hire your own staff,

73
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,555
我甚至可以让你挖走Max
and I'll even let you poach Max.

74
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,591
我还可以告诉你
I'll also tell you

75
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,593
新地点棒极了
the new spot is amazing.

76
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:24,195
很国际化 还是核心地段
It's international. It's a hub.

77
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,431
我说的是大型旗舰店
I'm talking major flagship.

78
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:28,700
亲爱的 我知道你很高兴
Honey, I get that you're happy,

79
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,969
但眼神交流已经够多了
but enough with the eye contact.

80
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,171
没有人能看着我的眼睛
No one can look me in the eye.

81
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,875
我是穿着香奈儿的美杜莎
I'm the Medusa in Chanel.

82
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,875
{\an8}希腊神话中的女妖

83
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,643
我们做爱的时候 Max也不让我
Max doesn't let me look her in the eyes

84
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:39,944
看她的眼睛
during sex either.

85
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,146
我跟你说过 眼神交流是额外的
I told you, eye contact's extra.

86
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:45,216
Max 你听见没?
Max, did you hear that?

87
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,951
大型旗舰店!
Major flagship!

88
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:50,621
呃 刚刚是有人叫我"大旗"吗?
Uh, did someone just call me a major flag?

89
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,323
我猜是你 要是我没能
I think you did, and if I don't get to

90
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,292
跟你们俩去新地方
go to the new place with you two,

91
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,860
我要去跟人事专员说
I'm telling HR.

92
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,630
我说的是Hector Rodriguez 我的治疗师
That's Hector Rodriguez, my therapist.

93
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,632
你有兴趣加入新"糕潮"
Would you be interested in coming to the new High

94
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,367
成为我们的一员吗?
as part of our team?

95
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,902
你要是再说"我们的一员"
If you say "part of our team" again,

96
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,237
这整件事我就要重新考虑了
I'll rethink the whole thing.

97
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,471
我接受
I'll take it.

98
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,040
但我必须跟Max一起在前面
But I have to be upfront with Max.

99
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,575
我不喜欢在后面
I don't like it in the back.

100
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,612
顺便一提 我跟每个男伴都是这么说的
Which, by the way, is what I say to all my dates.

101
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,413
我也是!
Samesies!

102
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,517
这真是个好消息
Well, this is great news.

103
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,519
我们吃个饼庆祝下怎么样?
How about we celebrate with a piece of pie?

104
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,586
不行!
No!

105
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,760
Earl 我们有好消息 猜猜是什么
Earl, we have great news. Guess what it is.

106
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,796
不 不要 好 猜吧 不 不要 好 猜吧!
No, don't. Okay, guess. No, don't. Yes, guess, guess!

107
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,064
我们能不能快点?
Can we hurry this along?

108
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,400
我侄子今天上了莫瑞·波维奇的节目
My cousin is on Maury Povich today,

109
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,870
我想知道亲生父亲是不是他
and I wanna find out if he's the father.

110
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,207
因为这样 我就可以不付抚养费了
'Cause then I can stop paying child support.

111
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,609
抱歉 她有点紧张了
Sorry. She's a little amped.

112
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,645
自打她发现我们地下室的
She hasn't had good news to share

113
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,313
洗衣机会嗑药之后
since we found out the washing machine

114
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,323
她再也没有别的好消息能分享了

Have you seen the Knicks lately?

119
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,965
他只是帮忙而已
He can only help.

120
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,967

不要在餐厅里乱来?
that there's no fornication in the diner?

134
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:45,674
或是不在Han的家里
Or in Han's apartment, ever.

你这么急着去哪啊?
Where are you running off to so fast?

00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,876
有人要甩卖小脑袋吗?

151
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:35,857
其实 他只能看到我们的膝盖
Actually, he's looking at our kneecaps.

152
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,992
好吧 看来是我说太小了
Okay, so we're going with too small.

153
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:42,430
如果你们俩不干了 我上哪找人替你们?
If you two quit the diner, how will I ever replace you?

154
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,465
除非我再雇佣... 随便谁都行!
Unless I hire... literally anyone else!

155
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,270
不 Han 我们晚上还是会在这里工作
No, Han, we still have to work here at night.

156
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,038
我们欠的债 比跟威尔史密斯老婆
We have more debt than Jada Pinkett-Smith

157
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,642
为她老公不在家找的借口还要多
has excuses for Will not being home.

158
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:56,677
但在新的糕潮店
But at the new High,

159
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:58,346
我们是发号施令的
we're gonna be the big bosses

160
00:06:58,347 --> 00:06:59,847
头头儿们
calling all the shots.

161
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,750
是是是... 白天而已
Yes, yes... by day.

162
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,886
到了晚上 你们还是上酸菜的翠花
But by night, you'll be the coleslaw's bitch.

163
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,790
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

164
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,093
很明显 Han是嫉妒我们的成功
Clearly, Han just resents our success.

165
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:17,063
可不是! 女人何苦难为女人?
I know! Why can't women ever just be happy for each other?

166
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,409
哇哦 好热辣
Wow, that is really hot.

167
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,677
嗯
Yeah.

168
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:34,013
这个辣酱不那么辣
The milder salsa's right here.

169
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,562
我说... 哦!
Listen... oh!

170
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,663
女生们都开始吃东西了吗?
Do girls eat now?

171
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,970
哇哦! 莉娜·丹恩把一切都改变了!
Wow! Lena Dunham changed everything!

172
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,606
你们俩当中的哪个和那个模特上过床的?
Listen, which one of you is sleeping with the model?

173
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,541
我知道你们有个跟我说了
I know one of you said you were,

174
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,543
但你说的时候我没听
but I don't listen when you talk.

175
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:52,346
是她
She is.

176
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,681
这是个大规模的广告宣传活动
This is a massive ad campaign,

177
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,884
我不知道该怎么说
and I don't know how else to say this,

178
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,287
但我需要他的弟弟再大点
but I need his penis to look bigger.

179
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,189
哦! 好吧...
Oh! Yeah...

180
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,892
你用光照它是会紧张啦
It gets nervous when you shine a light on it.

181
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,695
有时我还听到她用吃的
Sometimes I hear her coaxing it out of its crawl space

182
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,731
骗它出洞
with treats.

183
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,132
想想办法
Well, do something.

184
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,900
自我读大学后就没碰过小鸡鸡
I haven't touched one since college,

185
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,537
就算碰也是为了找底下的钥匙
and even then it was just to look under it for my keys.

186
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,006
Max 带他到后场去 专业点
Max, take him off set. Be professional.

187
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,842
我还能怎么专业?
How professional can I be?

188
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,511
她是要我玩他蛋蛋
She's asking me to fluff his nutter.

189
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,172
嘿 Nash! 休息一下
Yo, Nash! Break time.

190
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,249
所以... Marie
So... Marie.

191
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,985
Joe跟你说了我的升职的新工作吗?
Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?

192
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,987
当然了 我们是拉拉
Of course she did. We're lesbians.

193
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:36,923
主要时间就是聊天
Talking is most of what we do.

194
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,558
所以我们统治了白天
It's why we rule daytime.

195
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,429
呃... 请原谅
Eh... pardon me.

196
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,100
你还能原谅 那外套罪不可赦
You, maybe. That coat... never.

197
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,968
我是找人的
I'm lookin' for someone.

198
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,839
你看起来像是"安吉拉的灰烬"跑龙套的
You also look like an extra from Angela's Ashes.

199
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,440
但这是私人拍摄地
But this is a private shoot,

200
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:57,710
也就是说我们在拍摄私人部位
as in we're shooting someone's privates.

201
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,479
我在找我儿子
I'm looking for me son.

202
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,284
好了 各位! 土拨鼠出洞啦!
Okay, people! The groundhog's outta the hole!

203
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,453
又多了六英寸啊
Six more inches of winter.

204
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,889
就是他! 那是我儿子!
That's him! That's me boy!

205
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,290
妈?
Ma?

206
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,925
哈?
Huh?

207
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,228
妈 你怎么知道我在纽约?
Ma, how did you know I was in New York?

208
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,130
不是吧 你在"今日秀"窗口看到我了
Aw, no, you saw me in the Today Show window,

209
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,898
对不?

210
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,701
你脸书状态改成在"美国"了
You checked into "America" on Facebook,

211
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,369
你个熊孩子
you bleedin' idiot.

212
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,639
我直接飞到这个被上帝遗忘的脏乱差城市
I flew all the way and been lookin' for you day and night

213
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,742
日夜不停地找你一个星期了

214
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,644
我要带你回家
I'm takin' you home.

215
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,946
女士 Nash可以自己做决定
Ma'am, Nash can make his own decisions.

216
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,281
他是成人了
He's a grown man.

217
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,017
没错 多亏我鼎力相助
Yep. Thanks to my handiwork.

218
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:41,287
他才不是什么成人 他刚十八岁
He's no grown man. He's just now 18.

219
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:45,224
下个月才高中毕业!
He's got his prom next month!

220
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,359
开玩笑么!
I can't believe it!

221
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,794
我睡了青少年!
I had sex with a teenager!

222
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,530
我都成了什么人 伍迪·艾伦?
Who am I, Woody Allen?

223
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,400
罗门·波兰斯基?
Roman Polanski?

224
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:58,037
基本上所有七十年代的电影导演?
Pretty much any of your big-time '70s movie directors?

225
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,806
你跟我无知的孩子上床了?

226
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:02,708
呃 没那么无知
Uh, not so innocent.

227
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,310
他让我脸红过几次
He made me blush a few times,

228
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,846
然后我发明了两种体位
and I have two positions named after me.

229
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,648
够了
Well, that's that.

230
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,419
你以后不许再见这个大胸放荡女了
You've seen the last of big booby dirty girl here.

231
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,456
我想反对 但你说得没错
I'd object, but when you're right, you're right.

232
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,625
可是妈 我喜欢纽约

这里的人想拍摄我的小弟弟
People want to take pictures of me willy here.

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,565
我从不该让你看"魔力迈克"的
I should have never let you watch that Magic Mike.

236
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,203
这下好了
That's great.

00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,871
我现在没模特了
I don't have a model now.

00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,806
完蛋了
I'm Seal.

239
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,543
等着我跟Joe说这事儿吧
Wait until I tell Joe about this.

240
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:40,279
你怎么能不知道他几岁?
How can you not know how old he is?

241
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,382
呃... 我能说什么呢? 我们是典型的恋人啊!
Uh... what can I say? We're a typical couple!

242
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:47,551
他在年龄上撒谎 而我假装他很有趣
He lied about his age, and I pretended he was interesting.

243
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:51,456
好吧 Max 等Joe来了
Okay, Max, when Joe gets here,

244
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,658
我就告诉她
I'm just gonna tell her

我照看一个未成年的臭小子

与我管理她这个卖超贵夹馅饼的餐厅

247
00:10:57,163 --> 00:11:00,132
没有任何牵连

248
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,601
我相信她在这方面还是非常专业的
Yeah. I'm sure she'll be professional about it all.

249
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:03,869
专业?
Professional?

250
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,504
昨天有个女人因为穿了双廉价高跟鞋
Yesterday, she slapped a woman in here

251
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,305
在这里被她扇了一个耳光
for wearing cheap heels.

252
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:10,441
我知道 我的脸到现在还红肿着呢
I know. My face is still red.

253
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,744
她来了
Here she is.

显然 你们都被炒了
Well, obviously, you're both fired.

257
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,818
很显然
Obviously.

258
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,052
我能把帽子留着吗?
Can I keep the hat?

259
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,021
你不会想把它要回去的
You are not gonna want this back.

260
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:25,957
我头上出的汗就像野餐时的西瓜一样多水
My head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic.

261
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,860
求你了别为了Nash的事情炒了我们
Please don't fire us over the Nash situation.

262
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,829
这事儿我们也拿不准
It was out of our hands.

263
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,797
实际上 之前是被她手拿着了
Actually, it was in her hands,

264
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,833
而且只有18岁
and it was only 18.

00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,235
你们两个让我的女朋友很难堪
You two embarrassed my girlfriend.

266
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:39,137
在蕾丝边的圈子里难堪
And embarrassment in the lesbian community

267
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,105
比没有养狗还要可怕
is worse than not owning a dog.

268
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:44,175
比和双性恋谈恋爱还要可怕
It's worse than dating Anne Heche.

269
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:47,979
哦 天呐 我们犯下了双性罪
Oh, my God. We committed a Heche crime.

270
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,914
我们要怎么弥补这件事?
How can we make it better?

271
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,383
只要那个孩子明天能到摄影棚来
Just get that kid back to the photo shoot tomorrow,

272
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,385
这一切就都能恢复正常了
and we're back in business.

273
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,920
还有Max 下次
And Max, next time,

274
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:59,190
远离他那还没有合法的部位
stay out of his barely legal business.

275
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,092
没问题 虽然不懂 但没问题
Done. Don't know how, but done.

276
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,493
不会让你失望的
You won't be sorry.

277
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,729
赶紧把他带回来 我告诉你们...
Just get him back, 'cause I gotta tell you...

278
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,964
Marie哭泣的脸?
Marie's crying face?

279
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,965
我可不想看到
Not for me.

280
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,151
好吧 卷心菜...
Well, coleslaw...

281
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,586
在我觉得我快没戏了的时候
just when I thought I was out,

282
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,823
你拉了我一把
you pulled me back in again.

283
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,158
Max 别对卷心菜说这些
Max, don't tell the coleslaw that.

284
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,260
别给它这个权利
Don't give it that power.

285
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,596
我让Nash回来的计划会成功的
My plan to get Nash back will work.

286
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,865
我们依旧有一个光明美好的未来
We still have a bright, bright future.

287
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,800
没错! 只有在早上
Yes! By day.

288
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,970
Han啊!
Han!

289
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,316
你还想在这个卷心菜桶里
Do you want to spend another night

290
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,684
呆一晚上吗?
in this coleslaw bucket?

291
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,019
不想 而且上次我如果没能
No. And had I not been able to

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,687
自己滚到大街上的话
roll myself out to the street,

293
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,348
我可能就窒息而死了!
I might have suffocated!

294
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,895
Max Nash和他妈随时都有可能到店里来
Nash and his mom will be here any minute, Max.

295
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,098
你真有必要把自己五分之三的胸都露出来吗
Do you really need to expose 60% of your boobs?

296
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,500
这不取决于我
It's not up to me.

297
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,535
这对白妞有自己的生活
These girls have a life of their own.

298
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:06,710
右边这位刚组建了一个翻唱Fleetwood Mac的乐队
The right one just started a Fleetwood Mac cover band.

299
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,345
你知道到我怎么发现的吗?
You know how I know?

300
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,080
因为我把胸罩脱掉的时候 它自顾自的走了
'Cause when I take my bra off, it goes its own way.

301
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,080
{\an8}出自该乐队的歌名"go your own way"
g

302
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,853
你真的认为Nash的妈妈来这里
Do you really think you can get Nash's mother

303
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,688
拿Nash落下的行李之时
to change her mind when they come in

304
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,889
你能改变她的想法吗?
to pick up the rest of his stuff?

305
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,224
是的
Yes, I do.

306
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,692
因为我们两个有很多共同点
Because she and I have a lot in common.

307
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,794
我虽然不是爱尔兰人 但我也一样穷
I may not be Irish, but I'm dirt poor,

308
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:28,097
而且我也和一个嗜酒如命的人住在一起
and I'm living with someone who drinks way too much.

309
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,866
Max 你看
Max, look.

310
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,034
所有这些紫色的便贴
All those purple post-its

311
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,436
都是Spohie的家人和朋友
are Sophie's friends and family.

312
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,438
几乎没我亲戚的位置!
My family's nowhere to be seen!

313
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,602
就和我上次看美国人口普查一样!
It's like I'm looking at the last U.S. census!

314
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,571
姑娘们 快过来
Hey, girls. Come over here.

315
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:43,607
我们需要你们帮忙排这个座位表
We need your help with the seating chart.

316
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,809
筹办婚礼可比在满月之时
Yeah. You know, planning a wedding is more work

317
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,913
给Oleg的背上打蜡工作量要多
than waxing Oleg's back during a full moon.

318
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,082
Sophie 我现在有我自己的事情要解决
Sophie, I have my own issue right now.

319
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,117
好吧 那Max可以来帮我排座次
Okay. Then Max can help me with the chart

320
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:57,620
你就去担心你明显日渐变少的头发吧
while you go worry about your obviously thinning hair.

321
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,857
我全面透露一下
Uh, full disclosure...

322
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,226
上一次有人让我帮忙的时候
the last time someone asked me to help them with something,

323
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,329
我把他们的胡子吸掉了一半
I free-based half their beard off.

324
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,967
我收到Mash的短信
I just got a text from Nash.

325
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,170
他到了? 我去给他拿份儿童菜单
He's here? I'll go get him a kid's menu.

326
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,405
他们不来了
They're not coming.

327
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:18,641
他妈妈看到了我之前发给他的猥亵图片
His mom found the racy pictures I sent him.

328
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,744
"明天从JFK机场起飞
"Flying out of JFK tomorrow.

329
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,113
坐爱尔兰航空的早班机"
Taking the morning Aer Lingus"?

330
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,715
早上的"爱尔兰飞机"?
A little morning "Aer Lingus"?

331
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:29,785
不正是这飞机让Max陷入困境吗?
Isn't that what got Max in trouble in the first place?

332
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,989
好吧 我们要做的就是赶到机场
Okay, well, we just have to go to the airport

333
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,591
然后拦住他们
and stop them.

334
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:36,426
我会买好机票然后再把他们退掉
I'll buy us plane tickets and then return them,

335
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:40,362
就像我买鞋或者是汤姆·克鲁斯对待他老婆一样
like I do with shoes or Tom Cruise does with wives.

336
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,367
脱掉外套和鞋子!
Jackets and shoes off!

337
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,936
确认所有口袋里都没有遗漏物品
And make sure you check all your pockets.

338
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:50,472
不要让我因为一片口香糖戒严整个机场
Don't make me shut this airport down for a piece of gum.

339
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,811
这队比排队看"消失的爱人"都要长
This line is longer than the movie Gone Girl.

340
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:02,318
TSA是什么意思? "时间静止不动"
What does TSA stand for? "Time Stands A-still"

341
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,987
真有意思 从来没听到过这个版本
That's cute. Never heard that one before.

342
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,523
大多数人都会认为是 "这一坨翔"
Most people just go with "This Sucks Ass."

343
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,694
Max 别再大声喊叫了
Max, please don't yell out again.

344
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,462
人在机场会变得非常神经兮兮的
People get very jumpy in airports.

345
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:16,132
什么? 我喊的又不是 "我带了个炸弹"
Oh, what? It's not like I screamed, "I have a bomb"

346
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,268
女士 请你站到这边来好吗?
Miss, will you step over here, please?

347
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,204
我说笑的 我不是真的带了个炸弹
Oh, I was kidding. I don't have a bomb.

348
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:25,607
但是大家都觉得我... 有胸器
But I have been known to... be DA bomb.

349
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,677
Max啊!
Max!

350
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,079
求你了 如果我们走开了
Please, please, if we step away,

351
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,914
我们之前排的位置就没了
we'll lose our place in line.

352
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,984
我知道我们听起来像是来炸机场的
I know it sounds like we're here to blow up a plane,

353
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,052
但是实际上我们只是来阻止一个
but we're really just here to stop an underage kid

354
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,656
和她滚床单的未成年人离开这个国家
she had sex with from leaving the country.

355
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,758
我还是直接过来吧
So I should just come over there now.

356
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,994
没错 你刚刚被我亲手加入了
Yep. You just been hand-picked

357
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:48,730
"我不信任的人"行列
to join the "I don't trust you" dance party.

358
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,502
请出示你们的机票?
May I see your tickets?

359
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:56,205
天气不错 我喜欢你的发型
Nice day. I like your hair.

360
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,507
谢谢 我们只有脖子以上的部分
Thanks. We're allowed to be creative

361
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:02,111
可以自由发挥
from the neck up.

362
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,013
哦! 你们要去巴黎
Ooh! You traveling to Paris.

363
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,015
还是头等舱
First-class.

364
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,451
就穿这身?
In those jeans?

365
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:12,254
你买的是去巴黎的头等舱机票?
You got first-class tickets to Paris?

366
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,889
你疯了吗?
Are you insane?

367
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,157
我的手指自动选的
My fingers did it.

368
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,092
那是富家女的细胞记忆
It was rich girl cellular memory.

369
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,127
既然咱们哪儿都不去
And if we're not going anywhere,

370
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,963
那为啥不能假装去巴黎?
why can't we not go to Paris?

371
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,798
干嘛不假装要去卢浮宫?
And why can't we not go to the Louvre?

372
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,866
干嘛不假装要去住豪华酒店顶层套房
And why can't we not stay in the penthouse at the George Cinq

373
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,166
还能叫客房服务?
and not order room service?

374
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:31,003
现在说我不认识她是不是太晚了?
Is it too late for me to say I don't know her?

375
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,472
女士 你有没有携带爆炸物?
Ma'am, are you carrying any explosives?

376
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,207
我早餐吃的是墨西哥餐厅的剩菜
I had leftover Chipotle for breakfast.

377
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,510
那算吗?
Does that count?

378
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,946
对坐在你旁边的人就算
It does to whoever's sitting next to you.

379
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,617
法国航空113号航班
Air France flight 113

380
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,452
现在于24号登机口开始登机
will now begin boarding at gate 24.

381
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:48,920
Max! 那是我们的航班
Max! That's our flight.

382
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,390
法国航空113号航班
Air France, flight 113.

383
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,758
哦! 我打赌这飞机上
Ooh! I bet on the plane,

384
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,060
航空餐会有鱼子酱和贝利尼鸡尾酒
they'll have caviar and Bellinis.

385
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,828
你知道上面没有什么吗?
You know what won't be on the plane?

386
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,697
我们!
Us!

387
00:16:58,698 --> 00:16:59,931
我们不去了!
We're not going!

388
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,533
你是不是偷抽了我藏在胸罩里的
Have you been smoking the half joint

389
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,969
那半支大麻?
I have hidden in my bra?

390
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,637
你竟然有大麻?
You have a joint?

391
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:08,406
我是说银行账户?
Bank account?

392
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,009
你带着大麻过了安检?
You went through security with pot?

393
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,678
我三年级就是带着大麻过的
I went through third grade with pot.

394
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,880
找到他了 Nash在那儿
There he is. There's Nash.

395
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,649
我想他妈妈肯定在问
I'm sure his mom is asking

396
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,086
能不能让他去参观驾驶舱 见见飞行员
if he can visit the cockpit and meet the pilot.

397
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,922
哇喔 他真嫩
Wow. He's young.

398
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,590
布鲁斯·詹纳变成女人
So young, Bruce Jenner has been a woman

399
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,590
{\an8}布鲁斯·詹纳: 卡戴珊家族男主人 已宣布变性

400
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,792
也都有这些年数了
for most of his life.

401
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:30,528
Nash! 求你了
Nash! Please.

402
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,864
你不能走 我们今后的人生
You can't go. Our entire lives depend on

403
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,699
都取决于你能否完成那次摄影了
you finishing that photo shoot.

404
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,602
Nash Terrence O'Brien 你哪里都不准去
Nash Terrence O'Brien, you're not going anywhere.

405
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,804
否则我现在就抱你坐我腿上
Or I'll take you over my knee right here.

406
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,073
好吧 他很喜欢那样
Well, he likes that.

407
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,808
你...
Well, you...

408
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,911
你还真是逍遥放肆
You are just loose as a goose, aren't ya?

409
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,716
好吧... 你又说对了一次
Again... when you're right, you're right.

410
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:55,620
Max 让我和O'Brien女士谈
Max, let me talk to Mrs. O'Brien.

411
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,725
去登机口等着
Go up to the gate.

412
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,456
问问她们航班上会放什么电影
Ask what movie they're showing on their flight.

413
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:00,124
好吧 如果她们要放任何
Okay, but if they're showing anything,

414
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,326
我再强调一遍
and I mean anything

415
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:04,929
任何亚当·桑德勒的电影...
from Mr. Adam Sandler...

416
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,264
我就要上飞机了
I'm getting on the plane too.

417
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,569
拜托了 我求你
Please. I'm begging you.

418
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,537
你不了解我 我很高傲的
You don't know me. I'm a proud woman.

419
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:15,239
我唯一一次求别人
The only other time I ever begged

420
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,309
是为了从吹牛老爹的游艇下来
was to get off of P. Diddy's yacht.

421
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,745
连着开了三天的派对太久了
I mean, a party shouldn't be three days long.

422
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,380
小姐 你可以省省这些废话了
Miss, you can save your silly breath.

423
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,415
我要带他回家
I'm taking him home.

424
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,918
请Maeve O'Brien到登机服务台
Would passenger Maeve O'Brien please report to the gate desk?

425
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,354
Nash 也许他们同意把我们的座位
Oh, Nash, maybe they're bumping us up

426
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:33,891
从最后一排调到倒数第二排了!
from the last coach row to the second to the last coach row!

427
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,360
我就知道 我从未堕胎的行为
I knew I'd be rewarded for not having any abortions

428
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,295
肯定是会有回报的
in spite of me circumstances.

429
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,299
带上Nash... 在她分神的时候
Grab Nash... let's get out of here

430
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,801
我们快走
while I got her distracted.

431
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,003
Max 那是你干的? 怎么做到的?
Max, you did that? How?

432
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:48,539
我胸罩里的半支大麻没了
I no longer have the half a joint in my bra.

433
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,042
你用大麻贿赂了航空公司的人?
You bribed an airline employee with a joint?

434
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,879
我是指关节痛? 你应该多做伸展运动
Pain? Oh, you really gotta stretch out for that.

435
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,781
Max 这是绑架
Max, this is kidnapping.

436
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,451
他也没那么小 我在他这个年纪的时候
Oh, he's not that young. When I was his age,

437
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,153
已经抢了三家百视达影碟店了
I had already robbed three Blockbuster videos.

438
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,254
百视达影碟店是什么?
What's Blockbuster video?

439
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:10,194
天啊 我把一个孩子给毁了
Oh, my God, I screwed a baby.

440
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,696
好吧 我发条短信给Joe 告诉她
Okay. I'm gonna text Joe and tell her we have Nash

441
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,165
我们已经抓到Nash了 我还是打电话吧
in our custody. No, I'd better call.

442
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,002
在我们受审的时候 短信会出卖我们
That text won't play well at our trial.

443
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,838
对不起 没有告诉你我是如此年幼
I'm sorry I didn't tell ya I was so young.

444
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,840
但说实话 因为你也不成熟
