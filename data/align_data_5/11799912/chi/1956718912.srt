《小谢尔顿》前情提要
Previously on Young Sheldon...

8
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,740
我们已经聊了橄榄球和孙辈
Well, we've covered football and grandkids...

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,020
我们可能把能说的都说完了
Maybe we've run out of stuff to talk about.

10
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,010
我们还没聊你的前夫
We forgot about your ex-husband.

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,440
就是和你约会的那个人
The one you're dating.

12
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,210
我知道不要在下冰雹的时候招惹他
Well, I know not to piss him off during a hailstorm.

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,260
他有没有告诉你
Well, did he tell you that

14
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,220
我被他锁在门外的时候没穿衣服
I was naked when he locked me out?

15
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,000
你在下冰雹的时候
What were you doing naked

16
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,370
裸拿高尔夫球杆是想干嘛
with a golf club in a hailstorm?

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,100
你懂的  那时候是七十年代
Ah, you know, it was the '70s.

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,580
就想跟你说下我看了你的论文
I was just calling to let you know I read your paper.

19
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,810
你那中微子的质量是不可能的
The masses for your neutrinos are impossible.

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,200
我从零开始重写了整篇论文
I completely rewrote the whole thing from scratch.

21
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,610
我知道感谢名单是按首字母排序的
I know credits are usually listed alphabetically,

22
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,080
但你要把我放第二  我也没意见
but I'm completely fine with my name going second.

23
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,830
我不会把你的名字放上去的
I'm not putting your name on it in any way.

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
格兰特·林克莱特
Grant Linkletter.

25
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,890
斯特奇斯博士盗取了我的成果
Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work

26
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,010
用在自己的论文里
and is using it in his own paper.

27
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,080
你怎么敢指控我剽窃
How dare you accuse me of plagiarism!

28
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,780
你再也不要来上我的课了
I don't want to see you in my class anymore.

29
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,290
好的  斯特奇斯博士
I see, Dr. Sturgis.

30
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,730
对  那种行为的确难以原谅
Yes, that is unforgivable behavior.

31
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,170
好的  再见
Okay. Bye.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,690
他道歉了吗
Did he apologize?

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,140
没有  他对你很失望
No. He is very upset with you.

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,440
我对他也很失望
Well, I'm upset with him.

35
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,560
那你也不能
That doesn't excuse you from trying

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,210
跟林克莱特博士举报他啊
to get him in trouble by calling Dr. Linkletter.

37
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,170
那我还能和谁打小报告
Who else was I supposed to tattle to?

38
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,900
他妈妈应该已经不在了
I doubt his mother's still alive.

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,730
谢尔顿  我懂你为什么不开心
Sheldon, I understand why you're upset,

40
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,280
但你还是欠他一个道歉
but you still owe him an apology.

41
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,960
那你就是不懂
Then you don't understand.

42
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,140
现阶段  你俩还是
Well, for now, it sounds like you two

43
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,880
各自冷静的好
could use a little quiet time.

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,820
好吧  那我转去林克莱特博士的班
Fine. I'll switch over to Dr. Linkletter's class.

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,080
他比斯特奇斯博士高一个头
He's a foot taller than Sturgis

46
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,650
能在黑板上写的更多
and can reach more of the chalkboard.

47
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,210
我的意思是
What I meant was...

48
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,290
也许暂时先别去大学上课了
maybe it's time to take a break from your college classes.

49
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,800
什么  为什么  我可是全优
What? Why? I've gotten straight As.

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,280
我知道大学的课难不倒你
I know you're smart enough for college.

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,540
我只是不确定你是否够成熟
I'm just not sure you're mature enough.

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,210
显然你已经把我逼入绝境
Well, it appears you've backed me into a corner.

53
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,770
我现在想发脾气
I would throw a tantrum right now,

54
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,520
但那样就证明你是对的
but that would just prove your point.

55
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,410
你去哪
Where are you going?

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,500
玩火车去
To play with my trains.

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,770
可能听起来幼稚  但很多老男人也有这爱好
Which may sound immature, but it's a hobby many old men enjoy.

58
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,220
{\an9}*要说强壮我第一*
*Nobody else is stronger than I am*

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,980
{\an9}*昨日移山无人敌*
*Yesterday I moved a mountain*

60
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,690
{\an9}*你的英雄就是我*
*I bet I could be your hero*

61
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,980
{\an9}*小小身躯大智慧*
*I am a mighty little man.*

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,500
{\an8}《小谢尔顿》

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,500
{\an8}第三季  第十八集

64
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,340
你应该只盯着我这个啦啦队员看
I'm the only cheerleader you should be looking at.

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,040
嗨  我正在找你
Oh. Hi. Oh, I was trying to find you.

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,320
-只是来祝你比赛顺利  -谢谢
- Just wanted to wish you a good game. - Thank you.

67
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,810
我会为你加油的
I'm gonna be cheering for you.

68
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,660
-棒  -除非被我发现你在看别人
- Great. - Unless I catch you looking at someone else.

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,920
那我绝对饶不了你
Then you'll regret it.

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,340
我可没开玩笑
I'm not kidding.

71
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,010
嗨  乔治
Hi, George.

72
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,540
嗨  哈钦斯小姐
Hey, Ms. Hutchins.

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,010
你以前好像没来看过比赛
I don't think I've ever seen you at a game before.

74
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,620
今天是周五嘛  我答应了医生
Well, it's Friday, and I promised my therapist

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,240
会每周尝试一样新事物的
I'd try one new thing a week.

76
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,690
所以这周你选了橄榄球  不错啊
And you picked football. Good for you.

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,220
谢尔顿不在这儿吗
I don't suppose Sheldon's here?

78
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,200
是啊  他不太喜欢户外运动
Nah, he doesn't much care for outdoor sports.

79
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,410
也不喜欢运动
Or sports.

80
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,900
也不喜欢户外
Or the outdoors.

81
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,440
我还想着能不能找个人陪我坐着
I was hoping I'd have someone to sit with.

82
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,520
-不好意思了  -没事
- Sorry. - That's okay.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,380
我就不该心存希望
It was my fault for letting myself feel hope.

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
欢迎你待在场边看球
You're welcome to watch from the sidelines.

85
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,320
谢了
Thanks.

86
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,930
局外人一样看着生命流逝
Watching life go by from the sidelines

87
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,580
是我的作风
is kind of my thing.

88
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,200
小心啊
Hey, heads up!

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,060
我的天  你还好吗
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

90
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,000
不太好
I don't think so.

91
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,280
快叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,320
别担心  你会没事的
Don't worry, we're gonna get you taken care of.

93
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,100
要是我死了  告诉我的心理医生我恨他
If I die, tell my therapist I hate him.

94
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,920
谁说人要成熟才能读大学
And who says you have to be mature to go to college?

95
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,360
我看过《动物屋》[关于大学的喜剧片]
I've seen Animal House.

96
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,490
-是吗  -至少我看过海报
- You have? - Well, I've seen the poster.

97
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,120
那些人可不是什么上大学的料
Those people are not college material.

98
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,340
小可爱  我知道这话你不爱听
Moon pie, I know you don't like to hear this,

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,780
但人生中总有些事情
but there are some things in life

100
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,290
你要到一定年纪了才能明白
that can only be learned in time.

101
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,070
那你肯定啥都懂了  是吧
So you must have learned them all, huh?

102
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,300
给我出去
Get out of my house.

103
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,040
{\an8}梅德福社区医院

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,450
{\an8}急诊

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,020
-挺住啊  -挺着呢
- Hang in there. - I'm hangin'.

106
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,970
这可是个了不得的经历  可以讲给孙辈听
Hey, this will be quite a story to tell your grandkids, huh?

107
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,540
我独居  单身
I live alone. I'm single.

108
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,080
我觉得我不太可能会有孙辈了
I don't think grandkids are in the picture.

109
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
这个...
Oh. Well, I...

110
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,250
我有老婆孩子  但
I got a wife, kids. It's...

111
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,530
也挺不省心的
It's overrated.

112
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,970
然后我妈妈说
And then my mother said

113
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,890
我还太小  不适合上大学
I wasn't mature enough for college.

114
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,200
你敢信吗
Can you believe that?

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,740
当然
Absolutely.

116
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,560
所以你也觉得他们是对的
So you're on their side, too?

117
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,600
我是越南人  在我的文化里
I'm Vietnamese. In my culture,

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,050
只要爸妈还在
until your parents die,

119
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,180
那就还是个孩子
you're basically a baby.

120
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,010
真的吗
Really?

121
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,900
我奶奶就还是把我爸当孩子
My grandmother still treats my dad like a child.

122
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,720
吃饭的时候  奶奶不坐  他就不能坐
At dinner, he can't sit until she sits,

123
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,930
奶奶没问话  他就不能说话
and he can't speak until he's spoken to.

124
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,130
那我真庆幸我不是越南人
Well, I'm glad I'm not Vietnamese.

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,890
现实更加恐怖
It's not as fun as I make it look.

126
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,800
那可不能把她一个人丢在家里
Well, you can't bring her home to an empty apartment.

127
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,540
把她带回家来吧  我们来照顾她
Bring her here, and we'll look after her

128
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,990
直到她好起来为止
until she's back on her feet.

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,900
你确定
You sure?

130
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,940
当然
Of course.

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,620
我们让她住乔治的房间
We'll set her up in Georgie's room.

132
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,390
谢谢你  玛丽  一会儿见
Thanks, Mare. See you in a bit.

133
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,850
乔治
Hey, George.

134
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,640
你能这么照顾她  可真好
It's real nice of you, taking care of her like this.

135
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,610
我也有错
Well, it was kinda my fault.

136
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,460
也有错  这全都是你的错
Kinda? It was all your fault.

137
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,090
再见
Bye.

138
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,610
我们战况如何
Hey. How'd we do?

139
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,930
-你什么都没错过  -那么惨吗
- You didn't miss anything. - That bad?

140
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,540
我可以肯定地说  你已经看到今晚最精彩的一击
I can safely say you saw the best hit of the night.

141
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,160
她怎么样了
How's she doing?

142
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,490
还行
Well, not bad.

143
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,810
幸好
Could be worse.

144
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,660
头部轻微受损
A little whiplash,

145
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,970
肋骨几处擦伤
couple of bruised ribs,

146
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,080
胳膊断了...
broken arm...

147
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,960
还有锁骨
and collarbone.

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
就这些了
But that's it.

149
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,510
刚才真是太逗了  你跳开了
Pretty funny how you jumped out of the way

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,580
她被撞倒了
and let her get clobbered.

151
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,060
我才没有跳开
I did not jump out of the way!

152
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,330
你跳了
Oh, yeah, you did.

153
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,980
他们都给你录下来了
They got you on tape.

154
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
好吧
Okay, fine.

155
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,050
但那只是条件反射
But that was pure instinct.

156
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,010
况且  她也不应该站在场边
Besides, she shouldn't have been standing on the sidelines.

157
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,300
她站那干什么
Why was she there?

158
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
我让她站的
I told her she could.

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,920
你一定内疚到不行吧
Oh, man, you must feel terrible.

160
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,010
当然
Yeah, of course I do.

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,290
这你可是全责啊
I mean, it's all on you.

162
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,080
你说完了吗
You done?

163
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,940
不  宝贝  我才刚刚开始呢
Oh-ho-ho, baby, I'm just getting started.

164
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,410
小可怜  快进来
Oh, you poor dear. Come on in.

165
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,980
谢谢  希望我没给你添太多麻烦
Thanks. I hope I'm not putting you out.

166
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,140
当然没有
Of course not.

167
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,850
你好  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

168
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,700
你敢信吗  我妈说我不能去大学上课了
Can you believe my mother said I can't go to college?

169
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,030
你们没跟我商量就让她住我房间了
So you just put her in my room without consulting me?

170
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,390
跟你商量
Consulting you?

171
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,690
谁管你怎么想的
Who cares what you think?

172
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,080
我不睡沙发
Well, I ain't gonna sleep on the couch.

173
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,380
就几天
It's just for a few nights

174
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,450
等她能照顾自己就行
until she can take care of herself.

175
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,530
至少让我去外婆那住呗
Can I at least stay at Meemaw's?

176
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,410
只要你保证再也不回来了
If you promise not to come back.

177
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,200
你干嘛对我这么刻薄
Why you got to be so mean to me?

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,030
我喜欢
It just feels right.

179
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,780
斯特奇斯博士用了我的计算方式
And then after Dr. Sturgis incorporated my math,

180
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,020
论文作者却不愿意加我名字
he refused to give me a coauthor credit.

181
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,260
谢尔顿  她并不想听这些
Sheldon, she doesn't want to hear about that.

182
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,760
没关系
It's okay.

183
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,390
你骨头断的时候  你听见碎裂声了吗
So, when your bones broke, did you hear a crunch?

184
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,210
没有
No.

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,820
-我爸给你做人工呼吸了吗  -没有
- Did my dad have to give you mouth-to-mouth? - No.

186
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,780
我不知道我妈妈是怎么亲他的
I don't know how my mom kisses him.

187
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,270
接下来  大家看这个玫瑰...
Next up, we have this rose..

188
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,790
谁会买这种垃圾啊
Who buys this crap?

189
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,740
三杯啤酒下肚的我
Me, after three beers.

190
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,850
你看这个鬼玩意儿
I mean, look at this damn thing.

191
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,910
我当时在想啥呢
What was I thinking?

192
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,600
我能问你一个私人问题吗
Can I ask you a personal question?

193
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,170
遗嘱没你份
You're not in my will.

194
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
是我的女朋友的事
It's about my girlfriend.

195
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,320
不是啦
Nothing bad.

196
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,860
只是我和简已经约会一阵子了
It's just, I've been seeing Jana for a while now, and

197
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,410
我还挺喜欢她的
I like her fine...

198
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,750
但我觉得她的认真程度  超出了我的预期
but it feels like she's getting more serious than I want to be.

199
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,950
乔治  除非你结婚
Georgie, until you're married,

200
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,700
不然谁都没法捆死你
you are not tied down to anybody.

201
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,730
你可以继续做任何想做的事
You just go ahead and do whatever you want.

202
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,670
广阔天地  尽情享乐
Play the field. Have some fun.

203
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,760
有点意思
Interesting.

204
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,380
戴尔也是这么说的
That's what Dale said, too.

205
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,100
是吗
Oh, did he?

206
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,810
是啊
Yeah.

207
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,810
我男朋友
My boyfriend?

208
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,250
没错
Yeah.

209
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,950
我要是不去上大学
If I don't go to college,

210
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,260
我该干什么呢
what am I supposed to do?

211
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,320
整天呆在高中吗
Spend all my days in high school?

212
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,590
那得多惨啊
How sad is that?

213
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,970
是挺惨
Pretty sad.

214
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,570
你总是那么理解我
You always did get me.

215
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,380
看来你是被人误解了
Sounds like you're feeling misunderstood.

216
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,140
没错  被斯特奇斯博士  还有我妈妈
I am... by Dr. Sturgis, my mother,

217
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,770
可能还有整个越南文化
and possibly the entire Vietnamese culture.

218
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,740
你知道我现在有点疼吗
Do you understand that I'm in a little bit of pain right now?

219
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,750
不好意思  我应该表现出同情的
Oh, I'm sorry. I should be exhibiting compassion.

220
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,360
等等  我能嗷得更好
Wait, I can do better.

221
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,290
嗷得不错
Nailed it.

222
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,640
该吃止痛药了
It's time for your pain pill.

223
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,850
小心点  你可能会上瘾
Be careful. You could become addicted

224
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
然后丢掉工作
and lose your job.

225
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,050
那是你仅有的一切了
Which is all you have.

226
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,450
赶紧出去吧你
Get out of here.

227
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,520
谢谢
Thank you.

228
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,010
你感觉还好吗
You-you comfortable?

229
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,580
还需要点什么吗
Can I get you anything else?

230
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,900
不用了  我感觉还行
No. I-I'm okay.

231
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,560
你人真的太好了  还把我带回家
You've been so kind to welcome me into your home.

232
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,240
只是些力所能及的事
Well, it's the least we could do.

233
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,890
待在这样的家庭太幸福了
It's so nice to be around a family like this.

234
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,950
我一个人生活太久了
I've been alone for... so long.

235
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,500
说实话  除了猫  我身边一个人都没有
Honestly, if it weren't for the cats, I'd have no one.

236
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,850
等等  我的猫
Oh, wait. The cats!

237
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,180
{\an8}Edgar Allan Poe  埃德加·爱伦·坡
创建侦探小说  恐怖小说

238
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,180
我抛弃了埃德加和爱伦
I abandoned Edgar and Allan.

239
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,570
埃德加和爱伦
Edgar and Allan?

240
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,840
坡逃跑了
Poe ran away.

241
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,140
能不能麻烦你去喂它们  顺便传达我的爱
Would you please go feed them and tell them I love them?

242
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,250
能不能等到明天早上
Any chance this could wait till morning?

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,960
应该可以吧
I guess.

244
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,600
你要去哪儿
Where you off to?

245
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,770
喂猫
Cats!

246
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,400
你觉得他在和别人约会吗
So you think he's seeing somebody else?

247
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,320
我觉得我不该说这些
I don't think I should be talking about this.

248
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,590
-他是我老板  -他还是我男朋友呢  快说
- He's my boss. - Well, he's my boyfriend, so spill it.

249
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,870
老年人说男朋友这个词真怪
It's weird when old people say "Boyfriend."

250
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,720
行吧  我爱人
Fine. My lover.

251
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,980
更怪了
Well, that's worse.

252
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,080
赶快说
Then talk!

253
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,650
我只见过他和前妻在一起
The only woman I've really seen him with is his ex-wife.

254
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,400
是嘛  但他恨她
Oh, yeah, but he hates her.

255
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,950
看起来不像啊
Don't seem like it.

256
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,510
你这话什么意思
What do you mean by that?

257
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,290
-他们看起来很和睦  -有多和睦
- They seem friendly. - How friendly?

258
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,850
-不知道  他对她挺好的  -有多好
- I don't know. He's nice to her. - How nice?!

259
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,130
不好意思  我正看电视呢
Do you mind? I'm trying to watch this.

260
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,770
看看这个小家伙
Now look at this little guy...

261
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,200
小混蛋
Son of a bitch!

262
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,670
别跑  埃德加  或者爱伦
Here! Edgar! Or Allan.

263
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,180
不管是哪一只
Whichever the hell one you are.

264
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,860
他们有没有一起离开店子
They ever leave the store together?

265
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,640
我能去睡了吗
Can I please just go to bed?

266
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,860
先回答我的问题
Just answer the damn question.

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
我可能会因此被开除的
I feel like I'm gonna get fired for this.

268
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,460
乔吉  别担心
Georgie, don't worry.

269
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,370
我不会告诉别人的
Anything you say is gonna stay right here.

270
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,000
但你总是撒谎
But you lie all the time.

271
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,690
我就是跟你学会撒谎的
I learned to lie from you.

272
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,800
看我们的关系多奇妙啊
See what a special bond we have?

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,740
现在回答我的问题
Now answer the damn question!

274
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
你怎么去了这么久
Why were you gone for so long?

275
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,020
别说了
I don't want to talk about it.

276
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,000
{\an8}内赠鬼魂探测器
和朋友一起玩吧

277
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,400
这是什么
What's that?

278
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,290
这是麦片里送的鬼魂探测器
It's a ghost detector that came in my cereal box.

279
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,480
这就是张纸
It's just a piece of paper.

280
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,240
那它为什么会动
Then why did it move in my hand?

281
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,480
因为你在出汗
From perspiration.

282
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,140
或者因为有鬼
Or ghosts.

283
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,820
早啊
Mornin'.

284
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,530
你去看哈钦斯女士了吗
Did you check on Ms. Hutchins?

285
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,800
她还活着吗
Is she still alive?

286
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,960
当然  为这么这么问
Of course she is. Why?

287
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,390
没事
No reason.

288
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,330
我去和她一起吃早餐
I'm gonna go eat my breakfast with her.

289
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,450
谢尔顿  让她休息吧
Sheldon, just let her rest.

290
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
没事的  有我陪伴她很开心
It's okay. She enjoys my company.

291
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,180
另外  她能理解我为什么和斯特奇斯博士闹矛盾
Also, she understands what I'm going through with Dr. Sturgis.

292
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,340
什么
Excuse me.

293
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,230
我是在帮助你
I am just trying to help you grow up

294
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,010
长大成人
to be a functional adult.

295
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,940
帮我  你女儿还在找谷物鬼魂呢
Me? This one's looking for cereal ghosts.

296
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,400
而且我找到了
Looking for and found 'em.

297
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,170
我不管  你还不适合去上大学
I don't care. You are not ready for college.

298
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,730
如果都听你的  我现在还在上小学呢
If it were up to you, I'd still be in grade school.

299
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,300
你以为这样很成熟吗  并不是
If you think this is mature behavior, it isn't!

300
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,000
当妈很难  对吧
Being a mom's hard, isn't it?

301
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,980
偶尔吧
Sometimes.

302
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,020
如果你想找人倾诉
If you ever want to talk about it,

303
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,980
有我呢
I'm here for you.

304
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,320
它又动了
Ooh, it's moving again.

305
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,930
你真幸运
You're so lucky.

306
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,890
告诉我怎么个幸运法
You're gonna have to walk me through that.

307
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,800
你家里可没人告诉你
Well, you don't have anyone in your house telling you

308
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,610
该做什么  不该做什么
what you can or can't do.

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,900
是的  谢尔顿
Right, Sheldon.

310
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
我无依无靠
I don't have anyone.

311
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,730
我就是这个意思
I just said that.

312
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,160
你已经药物上瘾了吗
Are you becoming a drug addict already?

313
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,140
早上好
Mornin'.

314
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,720
来点希普利甜甜圈和咖啡
Got you some Shipley's Do-Nuts and coffee.

315
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,640
你的脸怎么了
What happened to your face?

316
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,790
不是埃德加抓的就是爱伦
either Edgar or Allan.

317
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,500
是埃德加
Oh, that was Edgar.

318
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,390
他淘气的很
He can be a rascal.

319
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,040
-早上好  -早上好
- Good mornin'. - Mornin'.

320
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,460
-你睡得好吗  -还行
- Did you sleep good? - Yeah.

321
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,160
要来点薄烤饼吗
Want some pancakes?

322
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,020
好啊
Sure.

323
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,020
就多问一句戴尔的事儿
Just one more question about Dale.

324
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,880
拜拜
Bye.

325
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,560
就这样
There we go.

326
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,680
切成小块  一口一个
Nice little bite-size pieces.

327
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,520
谢谢  乔治
Thanks, George,

328
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,060
但我能自己来
but I-I think I can manage.

329
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,700
不不  这是我的荣幸
No, no. My pleasure.

330
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,320
他内疚得不行  你说什么他都会乖乖听话
He feels so guilty, he'll do anything you ask him.

331
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
你说的够多了
That's enough from you.

332
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,740
他关车门夹了我的手
He bought me an Easy-Bake Oven

333
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,360
给我买了个烤炉玩具来赔罪
when he closed the car door on my thumb.

334
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,020
不像我妈  伤害了她的孩子
Unlike my mother, who feels no guilt

335
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,820
却不感到内疚
after hurting her children.

336
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,060
你好大胆子
How dare you.

337
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,740
我在保护你
I am trying to keep you safe

338
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,080
直到你有能力做出成人的决定
until such a time as you can make adult decisions.

339
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,140
我现在就行
I can make them now.

340
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,500
注意点  我们有客人
Hey, hey. We have a guest.

341
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,660
让我们假装相亲相爱呗
Let's pretend like we like each other.

342
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,380
玛丽  饭前祷告吧
Mare, do your grace thing.

343
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,780
你能接受墨西哥菜吧
You okay with Mexican?

344
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,330
还行  挺好
Oh, yeah. Terrific.

345
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,900
那就好
All right.

346
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,620
回家路上可以吃杂物箱里的抗胃酸咀嚼钙片
Now, I got Tums in the glove box for the ride home.

347
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,780
太棒了
Great.

348
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
你最近和朱恩联系吗
So, you talk to June lately?

349
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,360
最近几天没有  怎么了
Uh, not in a couple of days. Why?

350
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,680
随便问问
Oh, no reason.

351
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,140
我只是想给她打个电话
I was just kind of thinking about calling her myself.

352
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,940
如果你不介意的话
I mean, if you're okay with that.

353
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,340
和我前妻打电话  想打就打呗
You want to call my ex-wife, go ahead.

354
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,420
打吧
Call her.

355
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,640
我不想让你觉得不舒服
Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

356
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,080
我看你是想
Yeah, you would.

357
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,380
被你说中了
Yeah, I would.

358
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,980
看到你们相处得那么好我很开心
I think it's nice that y'all get along as well as you do.

359
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,880
说这些是什么意思
Where are we going with this?

360
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,240
没有啦  就随便聊聊
Oh, just nothing. Makin' conversation.

361
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,420
好吧
Okay.

362
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,920
你们睡一起了吗
You sleeping with her?

363
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,400
老天啊  才不会
Lord, no.

364
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,780
她是我前妻啊  拜托
She's my ex-wife. Come on.

365
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,580
我的天  什么变态会跟他前妻睡一起啊
Oh, my gosh, what kind of sicko sleeps with their ex-wife?

366
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,280
这话从何说起啊
Where is this coming from?

367
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,580
-你是嫉妒了吗  -没
- Are you jealous? - No.

368
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,260
我就是想知道
I'd just like to know, you know,

369
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,760
咱们的关系到底到哪一步了
what kind of relationship we're in.

370
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,060
我们还可以各自跟别人约会吗
I mean, are we seeing other people or what?

371
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
康妮·塔克
Connie Tucker,

372
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
你是要和我稳定交往吗
are you asking me to go steady?

373
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,080
别装傻了  魂淡
You know what I'm asking, jackass.

374
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,460
好吧好吧
All right, all right, all right.

375
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,840
听仔细了  我现在72岁了
You listen to me. Now, I'm 72 years old.

376
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
你觉得我还有那个耐性
Do you think I have enough stamina

377
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,620
去跟别的女人耍吗
to go playing around with other women?

378
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,360
你意思是  你跟我在一起
You saying the only reason you're seeing me

379
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
是因为你又老又累跟别人处不来了
is you're too old and tired to see anybody else?

380
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,880
给我拿下胃酸片
Give me the Tums.

381
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,600
真想跟你接吻到天荒地老
I could kiss you forever.

382
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,980
那时间有点长啊
That's kind of a long time.

383
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
怎么的  你有别的安排啊
You got somewhere else to be?

384
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,520
不啊  就是
No. It's just that,

385
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,480
早晚咱俩都会饿的啊
eventually, we're gonna get hungry.

386
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,820
我怎么总觉得你好像不太喜欢这样啊
Why do I keep getting the feeling you're not into this?

387
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,840
我可喜欢了
Oh, I am into this.

388
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,880
但是呢
But?

389
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,320
我是说我们还年轻  谁知道以后会怎样呢
I mean, we're real young, and who knows what's gonna happen?

390
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,580
我知道  你也应该知道
I know. And you should, too.

391
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,380
别难过啊
Don't feel bad.

392
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,020
我不知道的事可多了
I don't know lots of stuff.

393
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,260
正好咱们在聊这个
So, as long as we're on the subject,

394
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,040
你有跟别人约过会吗
are you seeing anybody else?

395
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,340
没啊
No.

396
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
那那个疯教授呢
How about that nutty professor?

397
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,930
我们只是朋友
We're just friends.

398
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,020
好吧  我跟朱恩也是
Yeah, well, that's what June and I are...

399
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,420
就是朋友
Just friends.

400
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,060
那我们算什么
So what are we?

401
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,660
不知道
I don't know.

402
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,100
你想怎么形容
What do you want to call it?

403
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,340
我觉得吧
I guess, a...

404
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,240
固定的伴侣关系
committed relationship.

405
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,520
可以啊  我看行
Mm. Works for me.

406
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,720
那行
Okay.

407
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,560
那就这么定了
It's settled.

408
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,220
康妮
Connie.

409
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,040
这种关系让我感到窒息
This relationship is suffocating me.

410
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,980
我说啥了
What'd I say?

411
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,710
你觉得我配不上你
I'm not enough for you.

412
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,200
我没这么说啊
I didn't say that.

413
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,920
说实话吧
Just be honest.

414
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,060
你就是想跟别的女孩约会
You want to date other girls.

415
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,260
我不想跟别的女孩约会[来取代你]
I don't want to date other girls instead of you,

416
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,180
只是  也跟别人试试看
just... in addition to you.

417
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,800
去死吧你
Drop dead.

418
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,580
好吧  但是我会跟着你  确保你安全到家的
Okay, but I'm gonna follow you and make sure you get home safe!

419
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,100
随便你
Do whatever you want.

420
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
如果你去冰激凌店  我给你买暴风杯
If you walk to Dairy Queen, I'll buy you a Blizzard.

421
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,980
要我放点音乐吗
Want me to turn on some music?

422
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,840
这太好吃了  玛丽
Well, this is just delicious, Mary.

423
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,100
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,620
切的大小合适吗
Bite-sized enough for you?

425
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,960
很完美
Oh. Perfect.

426
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,780
我还得坐在这儿生多久闷气
How long do I have to sit here and sulk

427
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,940
才会有人问我怎么了
before someone asks me what's wrong?

428
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,160
也许大家都听厌了
Maybe people are tired of hearing about it.

429
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,380
哈钦斯女士  你能附和我一下吗
Ms. Hutchins, would you care to chime in?

430
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,220
我不想介入家庭问题  但是
I-I don't want to get in the middle of a family issue, but...

431
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,580
我想说  我曾经和很亲近的人
I will say that I once had a falling out

432
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,650
闹翻过
with someone very close to me.

433
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,780
发生了什么
What happened?

434
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,940
我们最后分道扬镳了
We ended up parting ways on bad terms.

435
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,440
我现在还很后悔
I-I still regret it.

436
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,520
但当时你是对的  他们错了
But you were right and they were wrong?

437
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,800
你知道吗  这已经不重要了
You know what, it doesn't feel like it matters anymore.

438
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,420
我没有哪一天不想念他们的
And not a day goes by that I don't miss them.

439
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,420
也许我的确该给斯特奇斯博士道歉
Perhaps I do owe Dr. Sturgis an apology.

440
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,920
我刚说的是你妈妈
I was talking about your mother.

441
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
我回头再跟她道歉
I'll circle back to her.

442
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
谢谢
Thank you.

443
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,920
真不敢相信你说通了他
I can't believe you got through to him.

444
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,060
乐意效劳
Happy to help.

445
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,480
你跟谁吵过架
So, who was the person you had the fight with?

446
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,210
我的猫  坡
It was my cat, Poe.

447
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,880
我换了干猫粮之后她跑了
She ran away when I switched to dry food.

448
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,960
干猫粮更便宜
It was cheaper.

449
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,980
-晚安  宝贝  -晚安  妈妈
- Good night, baby. - Night, Mama.

450
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,740
我很抱歉  妈妈
I'm really sorry, Mom.

451
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,040
我原谅你
I forgive you.

452
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,140
但你和斯特奇斯博士和好了
But just because you straightened things out with Dr. Sturgis

453
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,820
不代表你可以回大学上课
doesn't mean you're going back to college.

454
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,890
-我可以  -你不行
- Yes, it does. - No, it doesn't.

455
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,780
你知道你这是在破坏我们的关系吧
I hope you know you're jeopardizing our relationship.

456
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,740
我愿意冒这个险
I will take that risk.

457
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,680
晚安
Good night.

458
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,000
你知道我总会说服你的
