老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第十四集

6
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,890
大家好  马修和莉莉去哪了
Hey, guys. Where are Marshall and Lily?

7
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,930
发生了件不幸的事
Something terrible happened.

8
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,420
他们没事吧  他们进医院了吗
Are they okay? Are they in the hospital?

9
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,410
没有
No.

10
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,720
那地方比医院还...糟糕得多
Somewhere much... much worse.

11
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,970
长岛
Long Island!

12
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,830
从今晚开始  我们就永居长岛啦
Tonight, we're moving out there for good.

13
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,830
{\an8}十分钟前

14
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,140
是啊  给你们我们新家的钥匙
Yeah. Here are your spare keys to our new house.

15
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,670
长岛
Long Island?

16
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,030
我不明白
I don't understand.

17
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,300
你在这也能买到美黑喷雾啊
you can spray tans here.

18
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,300
{\an8}长岛太阳辐射强  日照充足
年平均日照时间为2400到2800小时

19
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,560
我从来不愿相信这一天会真的到来
I never let myself believe this day would really come.

20
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,030
就好像《五口之家》再次被取消了
It's like when they canceled Party of Five for the second time.

21
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,990
{\an8}《五口之家》美国青春剧  共六季
因收视率低第一季差点被取消  但却在1996年意外获得金球奖

22
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,510
第一次是他们取消...看比赛的时候
I mean when they... canceled sports.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,540
各位  我们还会经常见面
Guys, we'll still see each other all the time,

24
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,040
经常打电话
and we'll talk on the phone.

25
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,140
我知道人人都说  有了孩子就意味着
And I know people say that having kids means

26
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,710
告别朋友  但是...
you won't see your friends anymore, but...

27
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,490
天啊  现在是道别  对吗
Oh, God, this is good-bye, isn't it?

28
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,970
好了  别这样
No. Stop it.

29
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,200
伙计们  这并无任何改变
Guys, this doesn't change anything.

30
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,530
我们离这儿只有四十六分钟的车程
We are only a 46-minute train ride away.

31
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,630
你们也随时可以来访
Just pop out whenever you want.

32
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,900
那...这里应该没人坐了吧
So... I guess this seat is open.

33
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
不  还会有的
No, it isn't.

34
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,600
我还是去搬把椅子吧
I'll go get a chair.

35
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,430
曲终人散
So that's it.

36
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,900
马修没了
No more Marshall.

37
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,970
莉莉没了
No more Lily.

38
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,230
他们都没了
They're gone.

39
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,560
这就意味着...
Which means...

40
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,420
再也没有扫兴的已婚夫妇
no lame married couple

41
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,650
把我所有的绝妙点子通通给否决掉
shooting down all my amazing ideas.

42
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,640
各位  好消息
Guys, great news.

43
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,310
我现在是本帮新的领袖啦
I'm the new leader of the gang!

44
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,460
<i>马修和莉莉几乎把他们的新家布置妥当了</i>
<i>Marshall and Lily were almost done decorating their new home.</i>

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,950
-放在这里好多了  -是啊
- I like it there much better. - Yeah.

46
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,280
<i>但还有一个问题</i>
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
不对
Wrong!

48
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,820
这个不能放这儿
This can't go here.

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,340
<i>孩子们  当莉莉的古怪老爸</i>
<i>Kids, when he found out she was pregnant,</i>

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,110
{\an8}两周前

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,620
<i>得知她怀孕后</i>
<i>Lily's estranged father</i>

52
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,760
<i>意外地出现在她家门口时</i>
<i>unexpectedly showed up on her doorstep.</i>

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,780
<i>莉莉深受感动</i>
<i>It was a gesture she appreciated.</i>

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,780
<i>可过了两周  他们就受不了了</i>
<i>But after two weeks, they'd had just about enough.</i>

55
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,960
椅子必须放到那儿
That has to go there

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,060
好遮住那块开裂的地板
to cover up the splintery floorboard.

57
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,840
照片也不能挂这儿
And you can't hang this picture here.

58
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,560
这块不是石膏  只是干掉的牙膏
This isn't plaster; it's dried toothpaste.

59
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,520
幸好我在这儿
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

60
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,270
我就是在这房子里长大的
I grew up in this house.

61
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,250
对它可是了如指掌
I know it like the back of my hand.

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,950
这盏灯不能杵在这儿
And this lamp absolutely cannot be here.

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,310
为什么不能
Why not?

64
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,140
阻挡我偷窥寡妇罗德里格斯
Blocks my view of the Widow Rodriguez

65
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,200
做老年健身操的视线
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

66
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,390
她有点太老了吧  爸爸
Isn't she a little old, Dad?

67
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,040
你眼中的她跟我小时候见的不一样
Oh, you didn't see her when I was a kid.

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,820
在我心里  她永远是五十四岁
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

69
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,160
我知道他是好意  但我再也受不了了
I know he means well, but I can't take it anymore.

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,240
他不会走的  他表现得
He won't leave, and-and he's acting

71
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,010
-就好像这里是他家  -对  我知道
- like this is his house. - No, I know.

72
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,570
而且他还到处留这些烦人的纸条
And these annoying notes he keeps leaving around?

73
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,540
"我练鼓的时候  需要绝对的安静"
"I need absolute silence when practicing the drums."

74
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,780
"不要碰我床头柜的软糖"
"Do not touch the fudge in my nightstand."

75
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,240
"我床头柜上需要防蚁"
"We need ant traps for my nightstand."

76
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,300
我发现自己老是躲在这里
I find myself hiding out here

77
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,120
就因为这里是这房子唯一一间
just because it's the only room in the house

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,150
他不会对我们指手画脚的房间
where he can't boss us around.

79
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,150
好消息
Great news.

80
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,400
我给以前的对讲机系统换了新电池
I put new batteries in the old intercom system.

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
这下我们可以随时沟通了
Now we can communicate at all times.

82
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,630
米奇通话完毕
Mickey out.

83
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,790
瞧瞧我们的卡座成了什么样子
Look at what's become of our booth.

84
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,110
就像我以前工艺课老师的手
Looks like my old shop teacher's hand--

85
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,710
会让人触景伤情欲罢不能
just sort of missing something.

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,650
够了
Enough!

87
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,010
我受够了你们俩在这儿唉声叹气
I am sick of you two wallowing in sadness,

88
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,570
还倒不如积极一点
instead of doing the healthy thing

89
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,570
假装那些离开你们的人
and pretending anyone who leaves you

90
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,760
从来没有出现过
never existed in the first place.

91
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,190
我很不想赞同巴尼这种
I hate to agree with Barney's

92
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,860
近乎自我麻痹的遗忘心理
near-paralyzing abandonment issues,

93
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,110
不过他说得有理
but he has a point.

94
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,220
不能因为朋友搬走了
You can't just stop living

95
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,800
你们就活不下去了吧
because two of your friends moved away.

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,340
非常正确
Precisely.

97
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,970
现在  作为团队的新领袖
Now, as new group leader,

98
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,290
我提议我们去做点
I say we go out and do something

99
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,670
马修和莉莉在时绝对不会去做的事
that we never would have done with Marshall and Lily here.

100
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,550
记得那次我想到一个绝妙的点子吗
Remember that amazing idea I had that one time?

101
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,100
-我们去脱衣舞俱乐部吧  -不要
- Let's go to a strip club. - Nope.

102
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,210
{\an8}2005年的每天晚上

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,880
你们觉得怎么样
So what do you say?

104
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,610
让我们用一段"坐鸡起舞"
Let's declare our independence

105
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,590
来宣告我们的独立
with an on-da-peen dance.

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,390
"坐鸡起舞"是指...
On-the-peen dance.

107
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,540
-我们懂的  -我们了解
- No, we got it. - We got it.

108
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,340
我们去脱衣舞俱乐部吧
Let's go to a strip club!

109
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,130
这个嘛...
Well...

110
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,190
反正不管我到哪儿都会想他们
I'm going to miss them anywhere.

111
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,440
能边看大胸边想他们也不错
Might as well see some cans while I'm at it.

112
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,650
这事交给我吧
I'll take it!

113
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,550
罗宾  凯文  你们去吗
Robin, Kevin, you in?

114
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,800
<i>孩子们  每一段恋爱的初期</i>
<i>Kids, early in any relationship,</i>

115
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,450
<i>都有一个让你凡事不忍拒绝的阶段</i>
<i>there's a phase where you don't say no to anything.</i>

116
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,890
<i>因为你想让自己看起来富有趣味</i>
<i>Because you want to seem interesting...</i>

117
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,890
{\an8}在中央公园看鸟

118
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,710
<i>乐于冒险</i>
<i>adventurous...</i>

119
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,710
{\an8}蹦极

120
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,590
<i>思想开放</i>
<i>and open-minded.</i>

121
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,590
{\an8}屠夫课程

122
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,340
<i>我管它叫做恋爱早期懦弱症</i>
<i>I call it Early Relationship Chicken.</i>

123
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,040
我乐于尝试任何事物
Well, I'm open to anything.

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,830
我也是
Oh, mos' def.

125
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
-那么...  -那么...
- So... - So...

126
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,990
我可不想去脱衣舞俱乐部
I don't want to go to a strip club.

127
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,350
我才不要去脱衣舞俱乐部
I don't want to go to a strip club.

128
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,740
但我不想让他觉得我假正经
But I don't want him to think I'm some prude.

129
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,320
天啊  我们已经拖延好一会儿了
Man, we've been saying "So" for a while.

130
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,410
-好啊  -好啊
- Yeah! - Yeah!

131
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,660
太好了
Yes!

132
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,970
今晚将会成为传...
Tonight is going to be legen--

133
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,540
等等  我们肯定去脱衣舞俱乐部是个好主意吗
Wait, are we sure it's a good idea to go to a strip club?

134
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,490
闭嘴  莉莉  现在我说了算
Shut up, Lily! I'm in charge now

135
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,850
...奇
-dary!

136
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,760
我手机没信号
I've got no cell reception.

137
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,180
我想打给泰德
I wanted to call Ted.

138
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,310
这感觉真奇怪
This feels weird.

139
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,840
上次我住得离他这么远
The last time I lived this far from him

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,210
还是我去海外学习的时候
was my semester abroad.

141
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,050
你从没去海外学习过
You never did a semester abroad.

142
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,900
我把住在校园的两端两两相望  称为"海外学校"
That's what I called it when we lived on opposite sides of campus.

143
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
不对
Wrong!

144
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,380
告诉我你不是要把它插进去吧
Please tell me you're not plugging that in there.

145
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,020
没错  米奇  我正要这么做
Yes, Mickey, that's exactly what I'm doing.

146
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,090
好吧  可以  我不会有任何异议
All right, fine. I won't say anything.

147
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,430
只不过  我从小就住在这间房
It's... just that this was my room when I was growing up,

148
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,660
所以知道的要比你多一点
so I know it a little better than you.

149
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,460
这里充满美好回忆
Lot of great memories here.

150
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,430
大部分是关于"探索"我身体的奥秘
Mostly just discovering my body.

151
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,410
够了
That's it.

152
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,990
米奇  自从你搬进来
Mickey, since you got here,

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,390
就什么也看不惯  还自作主张
you've been nothing but judgmental and pushy

154
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,290
还过分沉溺于自己青春期的性生活
and strangely obsessed with your adolescent sex life.

155
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,570
明天早上
Tomorrow morning,

156
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,240
请你从这儿搬走
you're out of here.

157
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,060
我只是想帮助你们
Well, I-I've just been trying to help you...

158
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,560
我们不需要你帮
We don't need your help!

159
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,630
我...
I...

160
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,840
没事的  宝贝
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

161
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,200
这话总得说出口
It had to be done.

162
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,340
真遗憾  唯一一个
Too bad the one person

163
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,150
能阻止你们犯这样错误的人
who could stop you from making mistakes like that

164
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,620
竟然被告知下个月必须搬走
was told he has to move out next month.

165
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,630
-是明天  -明天
- Tomorrow! - Tomorrow!

166
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,580
谁想请我跳支舞呀
Would either of you like a dance?

167
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,880
我随时准备摇头嗨起来
I'm always ready to rock.

168
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,360
我也随时准备晃脑爽起来
And I'm always ready to roll.

169
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,430
-那么...  -那么...
- So... - So...

170
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,890
我可没准备摇头
I'm not ready to rock.

171
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,140
晃脑会让我头晕眼花
Rolling makes me dizzy.

172
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,390
-管他呢  好啊  -太好了
- Hell, yeah! - Yeah!

173
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,900
我要为我的男人买一段膝上舞
I'm buying my man a lap dance,

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,240
女朋友就该这样
'cause that's just how I do!

175
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,470
尽情舞动吧
Party like a rock star!

176
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,310
尽情舞动吧
Party like a rock star...

177
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,770
伙计们  我是泰德
Uh, hey, guys. It's Ted.

178
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,620
你们可能还在忙搬家的事
Um... you're probably busy with the move still.

179
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,030
如果你们想找人扯淡就给我回电
Give me a call if you want to gab.

180
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,860
抱歉用了"扯淡"这个字眼
Sorry about using the word "Gab."

181
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,890
泰德  别再因为马修和莉莉闷闷不乐了
Ted, stop pining over Marshall and Lily.

182
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,890
有点自尊心好不好
Have some self-respect.

183
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,980
快咬住这张五块钱  好让...
Now put this fiver in your mouth so...

184
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,350
那个眼神性感的舞娘吸出来...
that stripper with the lazy eye can vacuum it up with...

185
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,680
-巴尼  -干什么
- Barney! - Wh-what?

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,070
我总有权利想他们吧
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

187
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,190
他们俩是我最好的朋友
They're my two best friends.

188
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,990
我才是你最好的朋友
I'm your two best friends!

189
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,000
而我今晚带你来这里
And we're here tonight

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,920
是为了让你知道  既然有更好的替代品
to show you there's no need to miss something

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,740
就没必要对以前的东西恋恋不舍了
when you can replace it with something better.

192
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,900
先生们  欢迎小茉莉出场
Gentlemen, say hello to J-J-J-Jasmine!

193
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,300
还记得她吗
Remember her?

194
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,090
{\an8}两年前

195
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,920
之前我们发现了一件超棒的事
So, a while back, we discovered the most amazing thing:

196
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,970
莉莉有位酷似者
Lily had a doppelganger

197
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,080
那人是个俄国脱衣舞娘
who was a Russian stripper.

198
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,780
看看她  泰德
Look at her, Ted.

199
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,110
她就像年纪大点的蹩脚货莉莉
She's just like old, less-good Lily,

200
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,700
可她不会对我们发号施令
but instead of bossing us around,

201
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,270
反而会对我们"一泄春光"
she shows us her boobs.

202
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,900
不许碰
No touching.

203
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,820
好吧  还是会有点儿爱发号施令
Okay, a little bossing us around.

204
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,960
我管她叫升级版莉莉
I call her Better Lily.

205
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,180
升级版莉莉  请为我朋友跳支舞
Hey, Better Lily, please dance for my friend.

206
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,430
巴尼  我不需要膝上舞
Barney, I don't need a lap dance.

207
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,390
我要和我的朋友聊天
I need to talk to my friends.

208
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,220
谁说你不能鱼与熊掌兼得
Who says you can't do both?

209
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,960
和她聊啊  她又不是没耳朵
Talk to her. She's got ears.

210
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,940
没错  她的确有耳朵
Yes, she does have ears.

211
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,550
你想摸我女朋友的咪咪吗
You want to touch my girlfriend's boobs?

212
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,980
五十块
50 bucks.

213
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,500
等等  升级版莉莉在和这个巨兽交往
Wait-- Better Lily is dating this behemoth?

214
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,500
这形容词会不会让你想起某人
Sound like anyone you know?

215
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,240
那是全新版马修
That's New Marshall.

216
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,020
本帮人齐啦
This is our gang now.

217
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,440
伙计们  又是我  泰德
Hey, guys, Ted again.

218
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,770
我开始觉得你们把我遗忘了
Starting to think you forgot about me.

219
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,920
还是某个酷邻居抢走了我的地位
Or replaced me with some cool neighbor.

220
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,400
这小子叫什么名字
What's his name?!

221
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,760
我逗你们玩呢
I'm totally kidding.

222
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,360
不管怎样
Anyway, uh...

223
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,260
我在努力回忆你们的样子
just trying to remember what your faces look like.

224
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,460
泰德  在脱衣舞俱乐部喝酒时
Ted, when they serve alcohol at a strip club,

225
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,380
给我爷们点儿
you're not allowed to show your vagina.

226
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,480
朋友  只需一百  裙底风光一览无余
100 bucks, and you will see the world, my friend.

227
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,570
他们已经懒得接我电话了
They're already ignoring my calls?

228
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,290
听着  我这个人很现实
Look, I'm realistic.

229
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,770
我知道我不得不习惯一个人去看牙医
I knew I'd have to get used to going to the dentist alone,

230
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
但我还是不觉得他们会把我三振出局
but I didn't think they'd cut me out completely.

231
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,030
如果他们不需要我们  那我们也不需要他们
If they don't need us, we don't need them.

232
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,030
终于开窍了
Yes! Finally!

233
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,460
对了  你看到她是怎么开瓶的吗
By the way, did you see how she opened that bottle?

234
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,500
在郊区断电  屋里...可真暗啊
Lights out in the suburbs is... is really dark.

235
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,930
保险丝盒在哪里
Where's the fuse box?

236
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,110
不知道
I don't know.

237
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,670
我知道在哪里
I know where it is.

238
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,970
如果我没在忙着卷铺盖走人的话  或许能帮上忙
Maybe I could fix it for you, if I wasn't so busy packing.

239
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,710
好吧
You know what?

240
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,460
我猜保险丝盒在地下室
I bet the fuse box is in the basement.

241
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,070
我...我自己去找
I'll just... I'll go find it myself.

242
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,330
能有多费劲
How hard can it be?

243
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,040
{\an8}hard有"费劲"和"坚硬"的意思

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
和你刚撞上的桌板一样坚硬
As hard as that desk you just walked into?

245
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,190
回击得好  米奇
Good burn, Mickey.

246
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,980
该奖励你一块床头柜里的软糖
You deserve a little nightstand fudge for that one.

247
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,310
我该看哪里
Where do I look?

248
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,590
我不能看她的胸部
I mean, I can't look at her chest.

249
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,970
该死  我刚看了
Damn it! I just did.

250
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,480
或许罗宾没注意到
Maybe Robin didn't notice.

251
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,940
天啊  他还真沉醉在那对大咪咪里了
Man, he's really up in those jugs.

252
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,650
动起来  宝贝
Shake it, baby!

253
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,540
好戏要上场了
A player's gotta play!

254
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,970
真奇怪
This is weird.

255
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,870
我还是看她的眼睛吧
I'll just look her in the eyes.

256
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,750
他难不成爱上这个脱衣舞娘了
Is he falling in love with this stripper?

257
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,620
快  要表现出无所谓
Quick, do something cool.

258
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,510
哥哥  好豪气呀
Make it rain, son!

259
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,200
老子不在乎钱
Money ain't no thang!

260
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,520
靠  里面有张二十块
Damn it, there was a 20 in there.

261
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,530
你好  埃里克森先生
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

262
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,410
根据风铃声来判断
From the sound of the wind chimes,

263
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,600
你已经到了一楼
I hear you've made it to the first floor.

264
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,440
好吧  米奇
Okay... you know what, Mickey.

265
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,250
省省你恐怖游戏大师那套吧
You can save the creepy game master routine.

266
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,300
它只吓唬到我一丁点而已
It's only kind of terrifying me.

267
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,740
可游戏才刚开始
Oh, but the game has just begun.

268
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,610
我管它叫"马修  在去地下室修保险丝盒的路上
I call it "Try Not to Bang into All the Furniture and Stuff

269
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,080
要尽量避免撞上家具和杂物"
on Your Way to the Fuse Box in the Basement, Marshall."

270
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,800
这只是暂用名而已
That's just a working title.

271
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,380
你的眉毛上粘了咪咪亮粉  皮条客
Got a little boob glitter on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

272
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,800
人在江湖飘  那能不挨刀
Straight pimpin'.

273
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
巴尼  你脸上也有
Barney, you got a little bit, too.

274
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,030
哪里
Where?

275
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,840
弄下来了吗
Did I get it?

276
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,910
弄下来了
Yeah, you got it.

277
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,940
谁需要马修和莉莉
Who needs Marshall and Lily?

278
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,560
我们组建了新队伍
We got a new gang,

279
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,370
而且我们永不分离
and we're all going to hang out together forever.

280
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,000
我的钟点到了
My shift is done.

281
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,610
再见
Good-bye.

282
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,690
等等  别走
Wait, stop!

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,030
严格说来  这首曲子还没完  所以你还是我们的
Technically, this song's not over, so we still own you.

284
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,040
再说了  我们是最好的朋友
Plus we're best friends!

285
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,820
接下来去哪里
Where to next?

286
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,240
我们要去地下赌场玩扑克
We go to underground poker game

287
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,600
在一个近乎废弃的精神病院里
in mostly-abandoned insane asylum.

288
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,400
太好了
Yes!

289
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,520
肯定超好玩
This is gonna be awesome,

290
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,200
到时我要你们都记住
and when it is, I want you all to remember

291
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,710
带领你们去的人是在下  巴尼·斯丁森
who led you there: Barney Stinson,

292
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,430
团队的新领袖
new group leader.

293
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,870
你们的筹码都归我啦
I'm winning all your chippies!

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,270
这时候不许喝酒
Let's not drink when we're...

295
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,370
我口渴  没事
I'm thirsty; it's good.

296
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,410
没事的
It's good.

297
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,800
马修  我刚想起来垃圾箱旁的抽屉里
Marshall, I just remembered I saw a box of matches

298
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,480
有盒火柴
in the drawer by the trash can.

299
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
好  谢谢  宝贝
Okay, thanks, baby.

300
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,280
莉莉  我找不到
Lily, I can't find them.

301
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,850
在找这个吗
Looking for these?

302
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,330
对了  你看不到我
Oh, right, you can't see me.

303
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,290
我在烧你急需的火柴
Um, well, I'm burning the matches you so desperately need.

304
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,160
米奇  你猜谁找到通往地下室楼梯了
Mickey... guess who found the basement stairs?

305
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,340
我马上就下去找保险丝盒了
I'll be down at that fuse box in no time,

306
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,850
一旦我到那儿
and when I get there,

307
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,710
我肯定能摸清保险丝盒的工作原理
I'm sure that I'll figure out how fuse boxes work,

308
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,410
然后修好它
so it'll be fine.

309
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,620
马修
Hey, Marshall,

310
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,560
我知道我一直在混淆你的视听
I know I've been messing with you,

311
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,970
不过说真的  那第二级台阶  别...
but seriously, that second step, don't...

312
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,480
我不想听  米奇
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

313
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,180
我的膝盖
Oh, my knee!

314
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,950
当心我的那套架子鼓
And watch out for my drum set.

315
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
我又赢了
I win again!

316
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,960
我刚在虚张声势
I was bluffing.

317
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,830
我甚至连牌数都不够
I didn't even have enough cards.

318
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,810
泰德  求你别再赢了
Ted, please stop winning.

319
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,980
看  这是纽约城的轮廓线
Hey, look, it's the New York City skyline.

320
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,280
* 建造筹码之城 *
* We built Chip City *

321
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,540
* 建造筹码之城  多得君之钱币 *
* We built Chip City on all your dough *

322
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,150
* 建造筹码之城  加油 *
* Built Chip City ? Hit it! *

323
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,300
跟你说  蝴蝶刀
You know butterfly knife.

324
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,390
我还以为那个"纹身脸"会先动手
I'd expect this from Face Tattoo...

325
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,330
或"歪嘴刀疤脸"
or Jagged Cheek Scar,

326
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,720
或拉里
or Larry,

327
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,190
但绝不是你
but not you.

328
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,740
我为什么没有外号
Why don't I get nickname?

329
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,260
因为你特征太多了  拉里
Because you have too many things, Larry.

330
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,720
只有一点才好取外号
You get one thing!

331
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,160
瞧  这就是你带全新版马修来的用处
See, that's why you bring New Marshall.

332
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,110
我们要去屠宰场参加派对
We go to party in slaughterhouse.

333
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,460
你们来吗
You come?

334
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,130
老天爷  我不想去啊
Please, God, no.

335
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,460
千万别再让我瞎指挥了
Don't let me be in charge of the gang anymore.

336
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,370
真不敢相信凯文医生居然忘了
I can't believe Dr. Kevin doesn't remember me

337
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,650
三年前给我做过心理辅导
from our sessions three years ago.

338
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,010
这不是刺伤了所有狱警的那个疯子吗
Is that the lunatic that stabbed all those prison guards?

339
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,570
我们必须参加那派对
We gotta hit that party!

340
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,150
我和真爱永远无缘了
I'll never find love.

341
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,970
我们必须参加那派对
We got to hit that party!

342
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,870
好耶
Sweet.

343
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,100
莉莉
Lily?

344
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,160
我觉得咱们不应该搬来郊外
I think we made a mistake moving out to the suburbs.

345
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,040
我想念我们的公寓
I miss our home.

346
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,060
我想念我们的卡座和我们的朋友
I miss our booth with our friends.

347
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,090
而且有个鼓槌正卡在我的
And I'm pretty sure I have a drumstick...

348
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,620
难言之处
somewhere bad.

349
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,640
爸爸  你为什么要这么做
Dad, why are you acting like this?

350
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,550
我只是想帮你们的忙
Well, I was just trying to be helpful,

351
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,920
可你们却要我在七月国庆节前搬走
but you guys want me out by the Fourth of July.

352
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,980
是明天就搬
Tomorrow.

353
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,800
你知道一个帮得上忙的父亲
You know what a helpful father,

354
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,400
或者是帮得上忙的姥爷会怎么做吗
not to mention grandfather, might do?

355
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,740
让这房子重获光明
Get these lights back on.

356
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,320
好吧  马修  听着
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

357
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,130
我将指引你找到那保险丝盒
I'm gonna get you to that fuse box.

358
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,100
求求你下来帮我把闸合上吧
Can't you just come down here and do it for me, please?

359
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,230
我对这房子一无所知
I don't know anything about this house.

360
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,420
不  马修
No, Marshall...

361
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,560
你是对你自己的房子一无所知
you don't know anything about your house.

362
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,180
行了  我们要干的事多着呢
All right, we got a lot of work to do.

363
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,950
在这里等着  我们去把你们弄进派对的"宾贵"名单
Wait here, we get you on VPI list for party.

364
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,870
你们每人就给  两百大洋吧
You give us, uh, $200 per person.

365
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,020
入场费嘛
Cover charge.

366
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,400
这入场费也太宰人了吧
That's pretty steep for a cover charge.

367
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,470
这派对可牛了
Is very good party.

368
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,000
主题是纽约"羊基队"和可口可乐
Is party for, uh, New York "Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.

369
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,900
{\an8}两者皆为纽约常见事物

370
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,450
我的天
Oh, my God.

371
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,670
可口可乐和洋基队的派对吗
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

372
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,630
感觉不像骗人
That sounds like a real thing.

373
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,100
好  马修  现在向前走三步
Okay, now, Marshall, take three steps forward,

374
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,800
同时注意低头躲开坏掉的吊扇
while ducking underneath the broken ceiling fan.

375
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,640
现在看向你的左侧
Now look to your left

376
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,080
吐一口口水
and spit.

377
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,240
那是热水器
That's the water heater.

378
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,750
离那玩意儿远点
Want to stay away from that.

379
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,370
它可比穿弹力紧身衣的寡妇罗德里格斯还要人命
That baby is hotter than the Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

380
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,110
绕过洗衣机和烘干机是最难的部分
Okay, now past the washer and dryer is the hardest part.

381
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,160
你必须从乒乓球桌下匍匐前进
You're gonna have to belly-crawl underneath the ping-pong table

382
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,410
轻轻碰一下都不行
and don't so much as nudge it.

383
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
为什么
Why not?

384
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,020
因为上面放置了九百块
Because there are 900 dominos set up

385
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,850
{\an8}美国老牌女影星  代表作《金发的珍妮》

386
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,850
摆成芭芭拉·伊登的多米诺骨牌
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

387
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,330
我是《金发的珍妮》的骨灰级粉丝
Big, big I Dream Of Jeannie fan.

388
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,470
我爬过去了
I'm clear.

389
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,540
我可不知道那是什么声音  米奇
I don't know what that sound is, Mickey.

390
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,980
那是我与芭芭拉·伊登性福无缘的声音
That's the sound of Barbara Eden never banging me.

391
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,200
美好祝愿分崩离析
That's what that is.

392
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,860
爸爸  快继续
Dad, get it back.

393
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,580
好  马修
Okay, Marshall,

394
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,070
向前走三步
take three steps forward,

395
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,310
就到保险丝盒处了
and you should be at the fuse box.

396
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,000
你觉得他成功了吗
Do you think he made it?

397
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,960
我成功了
I did it!

398
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,560
不  马修
No, Marshall...

399
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,240
是你成功了
you did it.

400
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,870
<i>有趣的是  那一夜启发米奇创造出一个</i>
<i>Fun fact: that night inspired Mickey's one</i>

401
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,500
<i>并且是他唯一一个成功的桌面游戏</i>
<i>and only successful board game--</i>

402
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,190
* 岌岌可危的地板  锈迹斑斑的铁钉 *
* With splintery floorboards and rusty nails *

403
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,470
* 危机四伏  步步惊心 *
* Make sure you don't get impaled *

404
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,930
* 拉灯 *
* Lites Out! *

405
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,640
艾得仁游戏倾情奉献
Brought to you by Aldrin Games!

406
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,650
从那位妓女接客的数目来判断
Well, judging from how many clients that hooker has serviced,

407
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,820
我们大概已等了一个小时了
I'd say we've been here almost an hour.

408
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,090
泰德  我们被人明抢了
Ted, we've been robbed.

409
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,860
升级版莉莉和全新版马修不会抢我们的
Better Lily and New Marshall would never rob us.

410
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,510
他俩是我们最好的朋友
They're our best friends.

411
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,120
冷静  各位

412
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,850
待会儿我要把这傻子洗劫一空

413
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,880
该死的  泰德
Damn it, Ted.

414
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,590
全新版马修就是只逃出动物园的大熊
New Marshall is an escaped zoo bear

415
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,470
而升级版莉莉唯一胜过我们莉莉的
and the only thing that Better Lily is better at than our Lily

416
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,570
就是她那手"隔裤摸鸡"的功夫
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

417
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,150
纯属猜测
I'm assuming.

418
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
我承认
I'll admit it.

419
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,410
这队伍我带不了
I can't lead this group.

420
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,140
我们需要马修和莉莉
We need Marshall and Lily.

421
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,250
但他们已经脱离队伍了  不是吗
But they're gone, aren't they?

422
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,460
咱们跟他们的碰面会从一周几次
I mean, it'll go from seeing them a couple times a week,

423
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,160
变成一个月几次
to a couple times a month,

424
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,790
接着要等逢年过节才能碰上一面
and then it'll just be holiday parties.

425
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,640
时光转瞬即逝
Then the years pass,

426
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,470
马修驾鹤西去
and you find out Marshall's dead,

427
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,940
起初你留下来安抚莉莉
and you're there for Lily emotionally at first,

428
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,120
然后安抚变成了爱抚  你深感愧疚
but then it becomes sexual, and you feel guilty,

429
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
但这愧疚却让欲火烧得更猛更烈
but maybe that guilt just makes it dirtier and better...

430
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,600
不  我不会让这一切发生的
No, I won't let that happen.

431
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,360
尤其是最后那部分
Especially that last part.

432
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,430
我知道今晚我有点醉  行为有点幼稚
Look, I know I've been a little drunk and naive tonight,

433
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,480
但我已经计划好了
but here's what's gonna happen.

434
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,520
首先  给升级版莉莉
First, we're gonna leave a note for Better Lily

435
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,570
-和阿维达斯留个条  免得他们担心  -伙计啊
- and Arvydas, they're worriers. - Oh, buddy.

436
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,570
{\an8}立陶宛籍前NBA球员  身高2.21米

437
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,320
然后我们就去找独一马修和无二莉莉
Then, we're gonna go see Only Marshall and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

438
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,710
因为他俩是我们最好的朋友
because they're our best friends

439
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,420
而且仅需四十六分钟的车程
and they're only 46 minutes away.

440
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,440
跟我走不
Are you with me?

441
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,780
虽然不愿意被你夺权  不过我们出发吧
Kind of resent the power grab, but okay, let's go!

442
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,450
你想跟我们一起去长岛吗
Hey, do you want to come to Long Island with us?

443
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,700
这个嘛  离天亮倒是还有一段时间
Uh, well, still a few more hours before the sun comes up.

444
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,590
那么
So...

445
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,140
-不想  -不想
- No. - No?

446
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,390
这样是不是不好呀
Is that bad?

447
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,860
不  好得很
No, it's great.

448
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,260
太棒了
