晚上好啊阿婆们 姑娘之夜在外小聚啊
Evening, ladies. Gals' night out?

吃着派 聊着帅哥 真欢乐啊
Chasing guys, eating pie,having fun.

3
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:10,457
这桌子粘乎乎的 快那破抹布擦擦吧
This table is sticky!Run a damp rag across it!

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,122
把这收拾干净能死啊
Would it kill you to clean a little?

5
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,690
你们这到底是啥地方啊
What kinda place is this?

6
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:16,036
这里的汤都是冷的
The kind that serves soup cold.

7
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:18,157
还有 你那夸张的耳环是咋回事儿
And what's with your crazy earrings?

8
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:20,059
难不成你是吉普赛人
What are you, some kinda gypsy?

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,361
喔 淡定啊 阿婆们
Whoa! Hold up, ladies.

10
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,464
人老不是犯贱的理由啊
You don't get a bitch pass just 'cause you're old.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,801
对 你们没听错 我就是说了
Yes, that's right.I said it.

12
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:32,070
你们进来吃饭 还一副黑社会老大的态度
You come in here with your gangster granny attitude,

13
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,805
想把怒火都发泄在
think you can get away

14
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,974
我这个吉卜赛服务员身上
with dumping all over the lowly gypsy waitress.

15
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,210
没门 在我们餐厅 没歧视你们老已经不错了
No way. At this diner, we don't discriminate due to age.

16
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,712
如果你么非这么混蛋下去
If you're gonna act like an ass,

17
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:43,214
我也要像对待混蛋一样对待你们
I'm gonna treat you like an ass...

18
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:48,586
等会你们的屁股摔得多痛可不管我事了 （ass的两个意思 大家自己体会 此处意译）
No matter how close that ass is riding to the floor.

19
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:53,056
好了 现在我再把桌子擦一下 然后我们从头开始
Now, I'll wipe off the table we'll take it from the top.

20
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:56,527
嗨 我是服务员Max 你们想来点木薯粉吗
Hi, I'm Max. Who wants tapioca?

21
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:59,729
这才像样嘛
That's more like it.

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,712
把你们的不爽都发泄到孙子孙女身上吧
Save the disappointment for the grandkids.

23
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,025
Earl 我需要另一本支票本
Earl, I need another book of checks.

24
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,380
刚才的一本掉在冰箱和烤箱的夹缝里了
The last one fell between the refrigerator and the oven.

25
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:20,115
当我正要去拿的时候我被夹在
I'd reach for it,but that falls between

26
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:22,176
“我不想拿”和“擦 我才不拿”的矛盾里了
"I don't do that"and "Oh, hell no."

27
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:27,056
Max 快看那边 穿西装的男女
Look overthere, Max.Men and women in suits.

28
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,418
我们的社区真是蒸蒸日上啊
This neighborhood is definitely on the rise.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,053
我还记得我看到一个黑人
I remember a time when a black man

30
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,721
不能叫出租车
couldn't get a cab around here.

31
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,774
那件事就发生在这周三
And that time was Wednesday.

32
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,877
Max 我刚和2号桌那对聪明的夫妇聊天了
Max, I was just talking to the smart couples in booth two.

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,080
他们是第一个在这里把croque monsieur
I know they're smart because they're the first people in here

34
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:42,614
正确发音的人
who ever ordered the croque monsieur

35
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:46,101
他们一定是聪明人
as croque monsieur and not "crock monster."

36
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,105
他们想见见做蛋糕的人
They wanna meet the woman who made the cupcakes.

37
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,606
我跟他们说你马上就过去
I told them you'd be right over.

38
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:54,043
-去吧 他们多好啊 -不 他们一点也不好
- Go! They're so nice.- No, they're not nice.

39
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:56,161
他们是时髦的吸血虫
They're trendy, blood-sucking locusts

40
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:58,414
专门到这个社区里来掠夺 摧毁一切
who come into this neighborhood to pillage and destroy

41
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,548
我所关心的东西
everything I care about.

42
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,783
深有同感
I felt the same way when the Hilton sisters

43
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,219
当年希尔顿姐妹就是这么毁了我的21岁生日
crashed my 21st birthday.

44
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,556
啥事儿
What?

45
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,425
这些蛋糕是你做的吗
You made these cupcakes?

46
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,761
是的 有啥问题 快说吧 姐忙着呢
Yeah, what's the problem? Spit it out, I've got a life.

47
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,764
我们就是想告诉你 你的蛋糕实在是
We just wanted to tell you that your flavor palate is...

48
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,299
太好吃了
amazing.

49
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,568
我不知道你是谁 也不知道你从哪里来
I don't know who you are or where you came from--

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,603
我自己都不清楚
Neither do I.

51
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,356
但是这些蛋糕真是完美
But these are fabulous.

52
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:27,242
欢迎你们来我们社区哈
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

53
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:28,744
我就知道我喜欢你们
I knew I liked you guys.

54
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,615
那些吸血中想干啥
So what did the trendy locusts want?

55
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,318
你太爱瞎点评了 你知道吗
You are so judgmental, you know that?

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,788
他们告诉我 我的蛋糕太完美了
They wanted to tell me the cupcakes are "fabulous."

57
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,956
谢谢
Thank you.

58
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,458
也许从现在开始你终于可以适应
Maybe now you'll finally start to get it

59
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,710
除我以外的人告诉你这些蛋糕有多美味
if someone besides me tells you how good they are.

60
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:48,097
我想那个形容词一定是“完美”
I believe the word was "fabulous."

61
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,932
Max 端菜
Pick up, Max.

62
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,501
Oleg 以后你要叫我会做完美蛋糕的
Oleg, from now on, you may call me Countess Max

63
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,303
Max女爵
of the Fabulous Cupcakes.

64
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:55,771
你以后要叫我Oleg先生
And you may call me Sir Oleg

65
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:59,858
因为我的裤子里也有好东西哦（大家自行体会）
of the Amazing Party in My Pants.

66
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:05,814
Caroline 那些快乐的西装男女
Caroline, the happy,shiny people in suits

67
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,483
让我把这张小纸条给你
asked me to give you this note.

68
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,485
啊 太好了
Oh, what a great idea!

69
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,353
他们建议我们到他们大厦楼下的咖啡店里
They suggested we sell Max's cupcakes

70
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,572
销售Max的蛋糕
at the cool new coffee place in their building.

71
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:17,242
可是你们已经在我的餐厅卖蛋糕了啊
But you already sell cupcakes here in my diner.

72
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,694
Han 我们的蛋糕是一项事业
Han, we're building a cupcake business that will one day

73
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:20,996
总有一天我们会离开这里的
get us out of here.

74
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,714
这就是我们人生的奋斗目标
That's what we're trying to do with our lives.

75
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:27,202
但我本以为我们有些特殊的关系呢
But I thought we had something special.

76
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,704
是 但那不是我们人生中的唯一
Yes, but we're not exclusive.

77
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:33,675
这间餐厅很可爱 但我想要获得更多
The diner's cute, but I want more than this.

78
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:35,694
嗷
Oof.

79
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,430
就像被初恋女友又甩了一次
First girlfriend all over again.

80
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:39,514
+

81
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,162
嗨 Johnny
Hey, Johnny.

82
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:45,330
Max照料墙那边的生意
Max has the tables against the wall.

83
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:46,932
我们坐在你这边就行了
Oh, we're good in your section.

84
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:51,453
Caroline 见见我的好兄弟Carlos吧
Caroline, I want you to meet my buddy Carlos.

85
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,788
Hi.
嗨

86
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,308
我去柜台忙了
Well, I'm working the counter.

87
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,876
你怎么了老兄 给点力啊
What's happenin'? Come on, dude.

88
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,561
你可是纽约大学文学专业的高材生啊
You have a literature degree from NYU.

89
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,396
我不想承认 但是当我紧张的时候
I didn't mean to say that, but when I get nervous,

90
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:03,131
我的家乡口音就显露出来了
my Rico Suave comes out.

91
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,633
我保证绝对不会再发生
It won't happen again.

92
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,102
菜单给你们
And here's two menus.

93
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:10,739
杂~样~啊~亲~
What's happenin'?

94
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:13,692
拜托 我真的很紧张
Dude, I'm nervous.

95
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,477
各位 我负责那一片桌子
Hey, guys, I'm in that section over there.

96
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,279
我们坐在Caroline这片也挺好的
Oh, we're good in Caroline's area.

97
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:20,248
如果你不怕热咖啡洒裤裆上
Well, if you like hot coffee in your pants area,

98
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
you're in the right place.
就放心大胆的坐这儿吧

99
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,836
其实 我挺喜欢那样的
Actually, I like that.

100
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,822
等好吧
Coming right at you.

101
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,493
Johnny坐在你那片儿
Johnny's in your section.

102
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:32,627
是啊 为什么
Yeah, why?

103
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,212
他每天晚上就是为了见你而来的
He comes in here every night to see you.

104
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:36,098
他是你的朋友 也是你的暗恋对象 还可能是随便什么东西
He's your friends or...crush or whatever he is.

105
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,833
他才不是我的暗恋对象呢 他只是
Shh! He's not a crush. He's a...

106
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:40,135
我不知道他是啥 但无论怎样
I don't know what he is, but whatever he is,

107
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:43,505
他今天坐在你那片了
he's in your section.

108
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,893
- Max - 噢 你怎么来了
- Max! - Ooh! What are you doing?

109
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,111
你不能进来的
You're not supposed to be in here.

110
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:52,814
我知道 谁让我是个坏男孩呢
I know, I'm a bad boy.

111
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,866
听着 今天我没有坐在你那一片
Look, the reason I'm not sitting in your section

112
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:57,786
是因为我朋友Carlos特别喜欢Caroline
is because my buddy Carlos is crushing pretty hard on Caroline

113
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,621
他让我去给他俩牵线
and he asked me to do what I can to hook them up.

114
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,990
噢 所以现在你既是个管吧台的
Oh. So now you're a bartender,

115
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,858
还是个街头艺术家 更是个拉皮条的
a street artist, and a pimp.

116
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,545
Ain't nuttin' wrong with me
pimpin' some boy on the side.

117
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,997
Keeps me in spray paint and whatnot.

118
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,549
So?

119
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:14,202
From pimp to pimp...

120
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:15,720
帮忙跟Caroline说说吧
Help me out with your girl.

121
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:19,891
我的姑娘才不会这么廉价呢
My girl don't come cheap.

122
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:25,230
这里面还真热啊
[Nervous giggle] Is it hot in here?

123
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:28,266
是啊 而且咱们还是在一个冰库里
Yes, and we're in a freezer.

124
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:31,052
这是我的冰库
Yes. My freezer.

125
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,888
呃 我就是想和Max说几句话
I was, uh, just talking to Max.

126
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,025
外面见
Um, I'll see you out there.

127
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:45,116
这就是你喜欢的男人类型吗
So is this what you like in the men?

128
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:48,170
才不是呢 他只是个有耍流氓的顾客
No. He's just a customer that went rogue.

129
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:51,239
他看起来又弱又娘
He is weak and girlish.

130
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,792
像你这样的女人 需要一个真汉子的陪伴
A woman like you needs a real man.

131
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,010
常言道啊
You know what they say.

132
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:59,014
只要你去过一趟乌克兰 你就会知道爱爱也是会很痛的 （大家意会吧……翻不出来）
Once you go Ukraine, you will scream with sex pain.

133
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,971
把这句“常言”翻译成英语 还真让人提不起性致
That probably lost some of its sensual appeal

134
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:09,524
不过还是谢谢你的提议
in the translation, but thanks for the offer, Oleg.

135
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:15,363
他很可爱，但不是我喜欢的型
Cute, but I'm not interested.Besides, he's not my type.

136
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:16,815
你就直说吧
Just say it.

137
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,234
你对他不感兴趣 因为他是波多黎各人
You're not interested in him because he's Puerto Rican.

138
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:20,569
你怎么会这么想
Where did you get this idea

139
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,070
谁说我只和白人约会啊
that I would only date white guys?

140
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:25,207
提醒一下你 我可是和很多种男人约会过的
For your information, I'vedated all kinds of men.

141
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,193
我曾经在蒙特卡洛和一个西班牙人约会过
I once had a Spaniard in Monte Carlo.

142
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,879
那不是ABBA组合的一首歌么
Isn't the title of an Abba song?

143
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,965
你真的不想和他约会吗 他挺可爱的
Are you sure about this? He's cute.

144
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:37,952
看遍了白人帅哥 也来一点异国风情尝尝鲜嘛
And trust me, you could use a little salsa in your white rice.

145
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:40,088
Max 我刚刚变得一贫如洗
Max, I just lost every dollar I had.

146
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,474
我现在对男人没想法
The last thing on my mind right now is guys--

147
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,643
无论什么类型的男人
<i>any type of guy.</i>

148
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,511
除了这个小帅哥
Except this guy.

149
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,313
嗨 小栗子
Hi, Chestnut.

150
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:51,016
我现在更专注于我们的事业
I'm much more concerned with our business

151
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,817
and getting my head back above water.

152
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,653
男人早晚都会有的
Men will come sooner or later.

153
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:59,574
根据我的研究 男人总是“来”的很快
Well, according to my research most men come sooner.

154
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,825
我觉得我们明天应该到那家咖啡店去
Oh, I thought we should stop by

155
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,611
向他们毛遂自荐
that new coffee place tomorrow and introduce ourselves

156
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,112
还有推荐我们的蛋糕
and your cupcakes.

157
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,581
我才不要就这样走进去 我感觉我在“卖”自己
I'm not gonna walk in there.I feel like I'm selling out.

158
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,751
我们得改改“卖”这个词
Okay, let's reframe the phrase selling out

159
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,453
应该是“卖出”
and make it sold out,

160
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,622
比如 Max 我们把蛋糕全卖出去了
as in "Max, we sold out of the cupcakes"

161
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:15,257
我们终于成功了
and are now successful."

162
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,625

What's that you say?

163
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,511
I can now afford to buy the wax dental floss again?

164
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,513
Fine.

165
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:23,498
我这么做就是为了让你先把我们的事业忘掉一会
But I'm only doing it so you'll eventually get your mind

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,966
然后找个男人欢乐一把
off the business and get laid.

167
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:27,102
你怎么就觉得我这么需要爱爱呢
Why do you think I need to get laid so badly?

168
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,638
如果我也和你一样
If I'd just gone through all the tension and trauma

169
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,273
经历这么多的创伤
that just happened to you,

170
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,224
I'd be climbing telephone polls to take the edge off.
我都愿意“爬”电线杆来减压

171
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:36,695
信我一句吧 我现在想的最少的就是爱爱
Trust me, sex is the last thing on my mind right now.

172
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,114
还有 说到改变
Oh, and speaking of reframing things,

173
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,699
我给你准备了个惊喜
I have a surprise.

174
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,200
我把我的屋子重新装饰了一翻
I redecorated my room.

175
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,653
I scoped out some cheap fabric in bedding places
我在Houston 大街的布匹店里

176
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,571
down on Houston Street.
仔细的选购了这些廉价布料

177
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:50,458
What do you think?
看看怎么样

178
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,995
I think you've made a vagina.
我觉得你把床整成了阴道形

179
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:57,582
What?
啥

180
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:01,136
Sister, you may think that sex is the last thing
姐们 也许你觉得爱爱是你最不关心的事

181
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:05,006
但是你把你的床装饰的像个阴道
on your mind, but you turned your bed into a vagina.

182
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,759
难道你觉得我的阴道还有帘子吗
Do you think my vagina has curtains?

183
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:11,680
我可不知道那有多“长”（邪恶的Max 啊……）
I don't know how long it's been.

184
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:13,515
我累坏了 我要去睡了
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

185
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,716
去吧  我还要做一些蛋糕
Okay, but I still have to make the cupcakes

186
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:16,184
明天好拿到咖啡店去
to bring by that place tomorrow.

187
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,552
我不想打扰你
I don't wanna keep you awake

188
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:18,903
要不你就睡我屋里的床吧
so why don't you sleep in my bed tonight

189
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,605
然后我今晚睡你的床
and I'll pass out on your vagina?

190
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:24,242
好 但明早你可得给我买早餐
Okay, but you better buy me breakfast in the morning.

191
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:33,184
我喜欢这儿 就像20年代的巴黎
I love this place. Looks like Paris in the '20s.

192
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:36,454
这些人更像一帮20多岁装模作样的年轻人
More like poseurs in their 20s.

193
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,423
呦 这地方还真被打扫过
Man, they've really cleaned this place up.

194
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:40,125
你以前来过这儿吗
You've been here before?

195
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,459
来过 这以前是卖酒的
Yeah, it used to be a liquor store

196
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:42,627
老板是个爱尔兰老男人
owned by this old Irish guy

197
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,213
他的老二上都有老年斑了
who had freckles on his penis.

198
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:47,081
有时候他把你逼到角落 然后露出来给你看
Sometimes he'd corner you and flash it,

199
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,751
但随后他都会给你一杯免费拿铁做补偿
but then he'd always comp you a free lotto ticket.

200
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,052
好 请你一定不要
Okay, well, let's try and keep

201
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,587
在我们销售的过程中
that sort of charming nostalgia

202
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,305
把那些“美好”往事给抖露出来
out of our sales pitch.

203
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,274
看 店主
Oh, that's the owner.

204
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,776
我仔细的观察过她了
I scoped it out before you got here.

205
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,861
记住 所有话都由我来说
And remember, I'll do the talking.

206
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,029
为啥我就不能开口呢
Why don't I get to talk?

207
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,732
说雀斑老二吗
Freckled penis.

208
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,066
还有 我经验比你丰富
And besides, I have more experience.

209
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:07,118
所有作为PEE俱乐部的成员
All those who pitched business models to Warren Buffett

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,103
在巴菲特那工作过的
as a member of the Phillips Exeter Entrepreneurs Club

211
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:11,939
和姐击掌庆祝下
raise their hands. Holla!

212
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,275
好吧 如果这件事儿真的值得击掌庆贺
Well, if you care enough to raise your arms about it,

213
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,295
还是你来说吧 我什么都不说
fine. You talk. I won't say anything.

214
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:20,248
嗨 想要什么
Hi, what can I get for you?

215
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,451
嗨 我是Caroline 这是我的合作伙伴Max
Hi, I'm Caroline and this is my business partner Max.

216
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,253
- 你的名字是 - semhar
- And you are? - Semhar.

217
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,806
- 我的神啊 - 多好听的名字啊
- Oh, jeez.
- Such a pretty name.

218
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:30,592
在梵文中 它是老虎之光的意思
It means "light of the tiger" in Sanskrit.

219
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:32,177
我了个去
Oh, jeez.

220
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,795
是我的瑜伽名字
It's my yoga name.

221
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,980
谁救救我吧
Help me, God.

222
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,732
Semhar 我们刚刚开始一项蛋糕事业
Well, Semhar, we just opened

223
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,651
是一家本地公司
a local neighborhood cupcake company.

224
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,769
这是我们的卡片
Our card.

225
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,570
我们正在向附近的面包店
We're introducing our exciting product

226
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:43,822
介绍我们的产品
to local boulangeries.

227
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,474
请尝一下吧 Max快拿过来
Please try a sample. Max.

228
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:48,743
你是想要椰奶咖啡味的还是巧克力咖喱味的
Would you like coconut-coffee, chocolate-curry,

229
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,829
或者是蓝莓柠檬味的
or blueberry-lemon zest?

230
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,114
我最爱吃椰奶咖啡味的
My absolute fave is the coconut-coffee.

231
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,365
尝尝这个吧 好吗
Let's start with that, shall we?

232
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:58,336
谢谢 不过还是不必了
Thank you, but no thank you.

233
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,789
我们可以知道为什么吗
Well, can I ask you why?

234
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
它们不够好看
They're not pretty enough.

235
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,926
拜托 你说啥
Excuse me?

236
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,962
他们真的不够好看
They're not pretty enough.

237
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,131
也许你尝一尝
Perhaps if you tried one,

238
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,434
你就会知道这些蛋糕有多美味
you'd see how amazing our flavor palate is.

239
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,602

Hold off, Flava Flav.

240
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,221
你说他们不好看是什么意思
What do you mean,they're not pretty enough?

241
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:19,190
他们看起来就像家庭烘烤出来的一样可爱
They have a charming homemade look,

242
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,558
但是这里的消费者想要
but my customer would prefer

243
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,027
更好看 更上档次的产品
a more upscale, prettier product.

244
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,697
友情提示 你这家上档次的咖啡店
Just FYI, some upscale residents

245
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:27,398
所在的这栋上档次的大厦
in this very upscale building

246
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
有一些上档次的居民最近告诉我们
where your upscale store actually is located

247
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,185
他们觉得这些蛋糕太完美了
recently told us they were fabulous.

248
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:33,037
我明白
I understand.

249
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,290
但他们实在是不够漂亮
But they're not pretty enough.

250
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,992
听着
Listen, battlefield earth.

251
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:45,250
这里是纽约的布鲁克林
This is Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

252
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:47,201
没有什么东西能改变一个事实
and no amount of exposed brick and paint

253
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:50,138
就在你所站的地方
can change the fact that,right where you're standing,

254
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,373
我看见Tommy o'hanlon老二的次数
I've seen Tommy O'Hanlon's wing-wang

255
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,309
多的我自己都记不清
more times than I care to remember.

256
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:57,645
而且我必须说 你的态度比他的老二还要冒犯我
And I must say, it was way less offensive than your attitude.

257
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,814
你把你那上档次的头发也剃了吧
And you can shove that up your upscale.

258
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:02,684
我们走
Let's go.

259
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,602
合十礼
- Namaste.- Namaste.

260
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:07,594
+

261
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,124
Max 这里怎么空了
What's with the empty hands, Max?

262
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,525
今晚没有蛋糕吗
No cupcakes tonight?

263
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:17,061
没有 蛋糕让我很不爽 我今晚不打算做了
No, they're bugging me. I decided to take the night off.

264
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:19,180
小心这样的决定啊
Be careful with decisions like that.

265
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:22,283
In 1987, I took a night off
from earth, wind, and fire

266
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:26,371
and the next day, they
earth, wind, and fired my ass.

267
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,409
抱歉 我来晚了
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

268
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,828
在你的阴道床里小憩了一会儿吗
Mid-afternoon nap in your vagina?

269
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,696
我倒想
I wish! No.

270
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:37,882
我去了Greenpoint的一家廉价烘烤用品商店
I went to a cheap bakery supply store in Greenpoint

271
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,300
给我们买了写东西
and got us some supplies.

272
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,551
看
Here.

273
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,303
这是一个基础蛋糕装饰工具
It's the basic cake decorating kit.

274
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:44,005
我还给我们找了件好事
And best of all I found us a fun,

275
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,140
两节蛋糕装饰课
reasonable two-session cupcake decorating class

276
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,308
在一家面包房
at a bakery.

277
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,143
我们可以学着做漂亮的小玫瑰花了
We can learn how to make pretty roses.

278
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:50,345
没门
No way.

279
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:51,846
蛋糕根本不需要那么漂亮
The cupcakes don't need to be pretty.

280
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:54,548
幽默感就可以弥补了
They compensate by having a great sense of humor.

281
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,685
好看的蛋糕只是我们的另一种选择
Pretty cupcakes is just another option for our business.

282
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:58,903
人们喜欢漂亮的 我们就做漂亮的
People want pretty, we do pretty.

283
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:01,272
人们喜欢家常的 我们就
Or people want homemade, we do--

284
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:04,659
-等等 我们的家常自制蛋糕呢 -今晚我们做
- Wait, where is our homemade?
- I didn't make any tonight.

285
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,661
你一个也没做吗
You didn't make any?

286
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:08,946
你就因为别人的一点批评
What, you get one piece of constructive criticism

287
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:11,282
就不打算做蛋糕了吗
and you stop making them?

288
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,051
Max 这是我们的事业
Max, it's business.

289
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,203
而且关于把蛋糕做漂亮 也许Semhar说的有点道理
And maybe Semhar has a point about making them pretty.

290
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,288
首先 她知道啥是漂亮吗
First of all, what does she know about pretty?

291
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,574
那女人的长发辫吓死人了
The woman has dreadlocks.

292
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,410
她的头就像
Her head looks like the stuff

293
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:23,928
从吸尘器里倒出来的垃圾似的
you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag.

294
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,096
一点也不漂亮
Not pretty.

295
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,432
忘了她吧
Forget her.

296
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,766
你怎么了
What's happening with you?

297
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,418
你对变漂亮有意见么
What's your problem with pretty?

298
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,223
别做出那个歌唱家的手势
<i>Don't wave your
divas live hand at me.</i>

299
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:37,141
我就是觉得我们这个社会
I just think society's way too concerned

300
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:38,976
太在乎别人想的漂亮了
with other people's idea of what's pretty.

301
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,595
你是觉得自己做不好
You don't think you can do it.

302
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:43,097
这才是事情的原因
That's what this is about.

303
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,315
并不是因为这个社会
This isn't about society.

304
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,733
你害怕你不能把蛋糕做漂亮
You're afraid you can't do pretty.

305
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,485
听着 我就是不想做的漂亮
Look, I don't do pretty

306
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,871
就像你不愿意和波多黎各人约会一样
the way you don't do Puerto Ricans.

307
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,656
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

308
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,491
我愿意“做”他
I'll do Puerto Ricans.

309
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,942
那好吧
All right.

310
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:57,578
去做一个 让我一个人待一会儿
Then go do one and leave me alone.

311
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,631
Max 这只是一项技能 就这样
Max, it's a skill. That's all.

312
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,667
不知道怎么做一件事 并不可耻
It's not shameful to not know how to do something.

313
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:05,253
难道你没有从小开始学钢琴的经历吗 
Didn't you have piano lessons growing up?

314
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:07,372
你开玩笑呢吧
Seriously?

315
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:09,223
滑冰呢
Ice skating?

316
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,476
我最接近滑冰的一次
Closest I've come to blades on ice

317
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,927
有个怀孕的女孩想拿刀捅我
was when a pregnant girl pulled a knife on me

318
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,679
在一场曲棍球比赛里
at a hockey game.

319
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,731
听着 我们现在有一项事业
Look, you and I have a business,

320
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,599
把蛋糕做漂亮就是一项我们需要的技能
and this is a skill we need.

321
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,435
我们一定要去上课
We're going to that class

322
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,019
然后成为把蛋糕做好看的大师
and we are gonna master how to make pretty roses.

323
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,637
我知道你讨厌一切时髦的东西
And I know how much you hate anything trendy,

324
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,991
所以我找到了布鲁克林一家意大利家庭面包店
so I found us a family-owned Italian bakery in Brooklyn.

325
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,693
意大利人可好了
Italian's good.

326
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,078
也许在我把你杀了以后
Maybe they'll know how to dump the body

327
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,362
他们知道怎么埋尸体
after I kill you.

328
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,454
首先 欢迎各位来到美美味蛋糕店
First of all, welcome to Spice and Sugar.

329
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:42,340
我们在做面包时有一个小小的变化
We did a little twist on the traditional sugar and spice

330
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:44,625
先放香料进去
putting spice first because...

331
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:47,345
因为我们是意大利人~
Both: We're Italian.

332
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,046
我们总是先把香料放在最上
And we always got the spice up front

333
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,498
再把一些放在最下
and a little in the rear.

334
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,550
给力哦~
Both: Holla!

335
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,770
想到你以前也说过“给力” 你是不是觉得很尴尬啊
Now are you embarrassed you ever said holla?

336
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:58,839
我名字叫Stephanie 这是我的表妹serena
My name is Stephanie, and this is my cousin Serena,

337
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,309
我们家族经营这家面包店很多年了
and this bakery has been in our family for years

338
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,644
现在我们接手了这家面包店
and then we took it over and made it...

339
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:07,031
把它变得更火辣了~
Both: Hot.

340
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,733
好好好 让我们先各自做一下自我介绍
All right, let's go around and introduce ourselves

341
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:10,451
并告诉我们来这里的原因
and tell us why you came tonight.

342
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,036

不不 我是她的商业合作伙伴
No, I'm her business partner.

357
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,606
我们在Williamsburg有自己的蛋糕事业
We actually have our own cupcake business over in Williamsburg,

358
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:50,908
我必须说 我们做的还不错
and I must say, we're doing very well.

359
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,277
Max是烘焙师 我负责销售
Max is the baker and I'm the business head

360
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,196
今晚我们想提升业务技术
and we're here tonight to increase our skill level

361
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,231
把我们的事业提升到一个新高度
and take our business up to a level that's...

362
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:00,034
和你们这儿一样火辣~
<i>Hot as well.</i>

363
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,402
如果你要说这么多话
If you're gonna talk that much,

364
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:04,905
我们就没时间学习了
no one will have time to learn anything.

365
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:06,424
我就知道
I know, right?

366
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,908
你们的面包店在哪里啊
So, uh, where's your shop?

367
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,744
现在我们只是在自己的公寓里做蛋糕
Well, right now, we're just working out of our apartment.

368
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,763
那么说就是没有店咯 还真可爱
- So no shop.
- Oh, that's sweet.

369
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,600
真好玩  祝你们好运 上帝保佑你
- Cute.
- Yeah, good luck, God bless.

370
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:18,019
你是不是嫉妒了
Can you say jealous?

371
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:19,437
好 我们从最简单的开始学
All right, let's start simple

372
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,638
做简单的冰花
with a pretty little icing flower.

373
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,756
每个人拿好奶油滚边带
Everybody pick up your piping bags,

374
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,392
注意要用直的一边
and with a straight-edge tip--

375
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:27,612
你们基佬可以用弯的
But you guys can use your gay-edge tip.

376
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:30,731
好 每个人跟着学
All right, everybody watch Stephanie.

377
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:31,983
把这个固定住
You're gonna take the nail head

378
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:33,150
然后做出个U形
and you're gonna make a little "U"

379
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:34,202
小花瓣就出来了
so that you get little petals.

380
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,486
重复五次就行了
And we'll do this five times.

381
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:37,738
然后一朵漂亮的五瓣花就诞生了
And then, you have a pretty little five-petal flower.

382
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,292
真简单  多可爱 太有趣了
- Simple.
- So cute. How fun!

383
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,961
不不 要做成U字型
No, no. You gotta start by making a "U".

384
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,329
这就是U啊
I did. That's a "U".

385
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:50,218
serena 这是U吗  不 这不是
- Serena, is that a "U"?
- Not a "U".

386
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,403
行 我重新做
Fine, I'll start over.

387
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,971
那明明是U
That was a "U".

388
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,840
难道就因为我没有实体店
And what, just because I don't have a quote-unquote shop

389
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,225
我就不知道U是啥了么
I don't know a "U"?

390
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,392
什么态度啊
What's with the attitude?

391
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,793
得 咱么走吧
All right, let's leave.

392
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,846
等这些基佬再笑的时候 我们就溜出去
Next time the gays giggle, we'll just slide out.

393
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,315
不 我们是来学习的
No, we're here to learn.

394
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,799
这看起来不错
That looks good.

395
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,852
我烂透了 我要崇左
I suck. I'm starting over.

396
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,987
Max 你为什么要这样 那明明很好
Max, why'd you do that? It was good.

397
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,239
还不够好啊
Not good enough.

398
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,823
你们还没做好吗
You two not done yet?

399
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,992
你必须学会做小花
You have to master the little flower,

400
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:17,328
否则等到学做玫瑰花的时候你就是一团糟了
or when we move on to roses you'll be screwed.

401
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,480
你说呢  绝对是一团糟
- Right, cuz?
- Oh, totally screwed.

402
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:22,617
实在是很糟糕
Screwed and not in the good way.

403
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,535
你觉得我们该不该告诉他们
Do you think we can convince them

404
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:28,489
互相扇耳光是一种新的庆贺方式
that slapping each other's face is the new high five?

405
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,044
steve 天啊 这小花太美了
Steve, oh, my God. That rose is gorgeous.

406
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,512
你真棒
Good for you.

407
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:37,498
好了 还有一分钟 然后就要展示玫瑰了
All right, one more minute and we'll display our roses.

408
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,968
嗨 steve 帮个小忙吧
Psst. Steve. Little help.

409
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,139
考试一计时我就完蛋 我SAT考试才得40分
I choke at timed tests. I got like a 40 on my SATs.

410
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:47,808
我擦类 steve
Damn it, Steve!

411
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,060
看看这儿
Look at this place.

412
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,311
在这种经济环境下
There's no way these girls

413
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,480
女孩子做蛋糕事业根本不可能成功
could have this much cupcake success in this economy.

414
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,649
我说 这栋楼的开支得多大啊
I mean, the overhead on this building alone--

415
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,866
你说啥呢
What are you saying?

416
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,184
又不是在说钱
Not saying mob money,

417
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,852
只是说也许我们也能开家店
just saying maybe we'd have a shop too

418
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,538
只要我们有一大笔钱   嘘嘘
- if we had mob money.
- Shh.

419
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,822
小点声儿
Keep it down.

420
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,457
你想明天醒来一早
You wanna wake up tomorrow with Chestnut's head

421
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:06,077
就看到小栗子的头在你的阴道床上吗
in your vagina bed?

422
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,647
时间到了 看看你们做的怎么样
Okay, time's up. Let's see what you got.

423
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,882
那是个啥 我怎么感觉啥也没有
What is that? There's like nothing there.

424
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:13,000
那不是玫瑰花
That's not a rose.

425
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,636
那是个迷你艺术品  随便吧
- It's minimalist.
- Whatev.

426
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:17,922
不是随便吧 这个可厉害了
No, not "whatev". It's brilliant.

427
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,374
当我在东京的时候
And I would know because,when I was in Tokyo,

428
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:22,510
我上了几节私人日式插花课
I had a private Japanese flower arranging class

429
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,845
是插花研究所的专家教的
with the head of the Ikebana institute.

430
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,347
他还说我有天赋呢
And he said I had a gift.

431
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:33,053
用他的话说 （日语)
In his words,
"Caroline...[Speaking Japanese]"

432
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:37,158
随便吧 你的朋友做的怎么样
Whatev. Okay, what about your friend there?

433
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,026
我时间不够了
I kinda ran out of time.

434
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:40,745
你有20分钟呢
[Scoffs] You had 20 minutes.

435
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,229
她说你可是个烘培师啊
I thought she said you were the baker.

436
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,232
你应该20秒就做好
No, you need to be able to whip these out in like 20 seconds

437
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,951
如果你想把那家小面包店做成功
if you wanna be successful in your little bakery.

438
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:51,405
我想要个蛋糕 12个小时候来取吧
"Um, I'd like a cupcake."
"That'll be 12 hours."

439
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,207
是不是 就是
- Right?
- Right.

440
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,759
而且要做的比这个还好看
And they have to be prettier than that.

441
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,594
也许明天你会做的更好
Well, maybe you'll do better tomorrow.

442
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:59,764
记得你们的家庭作业
Remember. Your homework assignment

443
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,384
做一个有漂亮的玫瑰花的蛋糕
is to bring in a cupcake with a pretty rose on it.

444
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,935
好
[Scoffs] Right.

445
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:06,253
说的跟我们还会再来似的
Like we're gonna come back here

446
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:10,107
还和这些罗伯特德尼罗混在一起
and spend time with these Robert de Nir-hos.

447
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,197
啊 又毁了一个 我擦
Ugh! That one stinks too. Damn it!

448
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,065
[Clatter]

449
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,718
Max 先放一会儿吧
Max, forget it.

450
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,703
三点了 快去睡觉
It's 3:00 A.M. Go to bed.

451
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,488
别跟我说话
Don't. Don't say anything to me.

452
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,374
我正在生你的气呢
I am so mad at you right now.

453
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:28,509
为什么  为你做的所有事
- What did I do? - Everything.

454
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,077
我以前最喜欢做蛋糕了
I used to love making cupcakes.

455
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,945
我只有在做蛋糕的时候
It was the one thing I could zone out and do

456
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,130
才不用动脑子
without thinking.

457
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,498
现在我尽在动脑子了
And now all I'm doing is thinking.

458
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
想着我蛋糕做的有多烂
Thinking that I stink at making cupcakes.

459
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:37,951
别想了
Well, stop it.

460
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:42,139
谁关心他们的想法 她们只是蛋糕恶霸
Who cares what they think? They're bitchy baking bullies.

461
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,808
我们不用再回去了
We don't have to go back there.

462
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,292
然后呢
Oh, and then what?

463
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:46,927
我会觉得我做的蛋糕不够好
I'm gonna think my cupcakes weren't good enough

464
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,179
余生在郁闷中度过
for the rest of my life?

465
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:50,648
既然你说我们需要这项技术 我们就要掌握这项技术
You said we need the skill,then we need the skill.

466
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,100
我虽然有很多坏毛病 但绝对不是半途而废的人
I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a quitter.

467
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:56,136
我要做一个傻不拉唧的漂亮蛋糕出来 哪怕得把自己活活折腾死
I'm gonna make a stupid,pretty cupcake if it kills me.

468
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,355

Or you.

469
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:00,107
你也要和我一起去
And you are going back there with me.

470
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,609
我们要把我们的漂亮蛋糕
And we're gonna shove our pretty cupcake

471
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,912
好好让snooki和她表妹开开眼 （此处是关于泽西海滩的笑话）
right up Snooki and her cousin's asses.

472
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:07,748
现在闭嘴 别跟我说话
Now, shut up, don't talk to me,

473
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,702
回你的阴道床睡觉去
and go back in your vagina.

474
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,705
很抱歉让你看到这些了 小栗子
Sorry you had to see that, Chestnut.

475
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:16,746
+

476
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:22,467
嗷 不怎么好看
Oh, not very pretty.

477
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:24,569
不过至少你已经尽力了michale
But at least you tried, Michael.

478
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,853
还有一个问题
Just one question.

479
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:28,089
你确定你是基佬吗
Are you sure that you're gay?

480
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,395
好 caroline 看看你做的
Oh, okay, Caroline. Let's see your pretty rose.

481
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:35,696
我没做
I didn't do one.

482
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:36,998
这个社会太关注别人的想法了
Society is way too concerned with other people's idea

483
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,282
关于什么是美丽
of what's pretty.

484
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:40,368
随便吧
Both: Whatevs.

485

好 你的烘培师做了么
Okay, what about your baker there?

486
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,254

She bail too?

487
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,739
不 她做了
No, here it is.

488

那种蛋糕不是我的风格 我不做徒有外表的东西
That cupcake wasn't me. I don't do pretty.

500
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,122
但是我还做了一些蛋糕
But I did make each of you a cupcake that I think says

501
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:21,108
可以表达我对这个蛋糕课程的看法
what I feel about this whole cupcake class.

502
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,079
这个写着 去死吧

这个写着 滚你丫
This one says "Screw U".

看见没 这才是U 
You see that "U"? That's a "U".

505
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,087
给力吧
Holla!

00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,627
好吧 祝你好运

人们可不喜欢这些冒犯他们的蛋糕
People don't want cupcakes that insult them.

508
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,234
天啊 Max 这就是我们该做的
Oh, my God, Max. That's our thing.

509
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,435
我错了 你是对的
I was wrong. You were right.

510
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:48,769
我们不需要做好看的蛋糕
We don't need to make pretty cupcakes.

511
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:50,021
别的人都做好看的蛋糕
Everybody does pretty.
