1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,331
What you doing there?

2
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:09,197
Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner? Heh, heh.

3
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:13,706
The humorous implication
being that I am Wile E. Coyote?

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,371
Yes.

5
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:19,046
And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device...

6
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:22,911
...that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,981
Yes.

8
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:34,323
Okay, what I'm doing here is trying
to determine when I'm going to die.

9
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,727
Mm-hm. A lot of people
are working on that research.

10
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,196
So, what is all this?

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,204
My family history factoring in longevity,
propensity for disease, et cetera.

12
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:46,807
Interesting.

13
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,135
Cause of death for Uncle Carl
was KBB?

14
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:52,644
- What's KBB?
- Killed by badger.

15
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,906
How's that?

16
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,415
It was Thanksgiving.

17
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:01,386
Uncle Carl said, "I think there's a badger
living in our chimney.

18
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,615
Hand me that flashlight."

19
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:08,023
Those were the last words
he ever spoke to us.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,427
I don't think you need to worry
about death by badgers being hereditary.

21
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:13,726
Not true.

22
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:16,496
The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

23
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:20,437
Instead of fleeing,
he chose to fight barehanded...

24
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,271
...against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

25
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,946
Who's to say
that I don't share that flawed DNA?

26
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,912
Hmm, we can always get a badger
and find out.

27
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:37,182
But seriously, even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor...

28
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,793
...at best, I have 60 years left.

29
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,428
That long, huh?

30
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,996
Sixty only takes me to here.

31
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,259
I need to get to here.

32
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,696
What's there?

33
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,633
The earliest estimate
of the singularity.

34
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:54,105
When man will be able to transfer
his consciousness into machines...

35
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,868
...and achieve immortality.

36
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:59,010
So you're upset about missing out...

37
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,979
...on becoming some sort
of freakish self-aware robot?

38
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,846
By this much.

39
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:08,322
Tough break. You want eggs?

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,290
You don't get it, Leonard.
I'm going to miss so much.

41
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:17,626
Unified field theory,
cold fusion, the dogapus.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,824
What's a dogapus?

43
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,902
The hybrid dog and octopus.

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,799
Man's underwater best friend.

45
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,910
- Is somebody working on that?
- I was going to.

46
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,547
I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

47
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:35,546
Wait, you hate dogs.

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,913
A dogapus
can play fetch with eight balls.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,382
No one can hate that.

50
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:09,173
What do we owe you?

51
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:11,911
It came to 28.17.
Let's say six bucks a piece.

52
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,681
Here you go.

53
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,789
Thank you.

54
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,457
- What?
- Uh...

55
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,098
- Never mind. I got it.
- Oh, you wanted me to pay.

56
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,699
- It's no big deal.
- Right.

57
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,529
We're not going out anymore,
I should pay for myself.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,439
What?

59
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:37,840
He said if he had woman parts,
he'd eat for free the rest of his life.

60
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,574
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

61
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,311
I'm a little low on cash.

62
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,386
- How much you got?
- Nothing.

63
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,024
- How can you walk around with no money?
- I'm cute, I get by.

64
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,624
It's okay, you can owe me.
Sheldon, six bucks.

65
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:58,321
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

66
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,524
But it's Thursday.
Thursday's pizza night.

67
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:01,726
Not for me.

68
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:05,304
Thursday is now
cruciferous vegetable night.

69
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,567
Tonight's selection, Brussels sprouts.

70
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:12,543
Really? You're changing
the Sheldonian calendar?

71
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,905
It's a small price to pay.

72
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,583
- For what?
- No, don't ask.

73
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,116
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

74
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,584
To live long enough to fuse
my consciousness with cybernetics...

75
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,087
...I need to change my diet.

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,260
- Wait, cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
- Correct.

77
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,759
You wanna turn yourself
into some sort of robot?

78
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:30,955
Essentially, yes.

79
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,726
Didn't you already do that?

80
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:36,462
Heh, heh, heh.

81
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,736
Flattering, but sadly, no.

82
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:42,006
I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen...

83
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:46,136
...designed to strengthen my
cardiovascular system, a.k.a., jogging.

84
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:48,407
Wait, honey,
have you ever run before?

85
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:53,748
Certainly. I've run from bullies,
dogs, angry chickens...

86
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:57,186
...and one particularly persistent
PE teacher...

87
00:04:57,392 --> 00:05:00,623
...determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

88
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,364
You're right. Penny jogs.

89
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:09,662
- Maybe you guys can run together.
- That's an excellent idea.

90
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:13,105
Yeah, if we chat...

91
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,799
...it will create the illusion
of time going faster.

92
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,639
No, it won't.

93
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,105
Um, hey, how does he know I jog?

94
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:25,013
Oh, he watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,147
Oh, my God, that is so creepy.

96
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,289
I know.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,419
And he says he's not gonna stop.

98
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:40,827
Yeah, well, then see a shrink
and figure out how to talk to women.

99
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,847
What the hell?

100
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:58,811
What's the matter?

101
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:03,515
I have pain radiating from my navel
to my lower right abdomen.

102
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,590
I'm nauseated and feverish.

103
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,527
I believe I may have cholera.

104
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,755
There's no cholera in Pasadena.

105
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:13,900
Just like last summer
when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

106
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:17,594
Well, if it's not cholera,
then based on a quick Internet search...

107
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:21,037
...the other explanations
in decreasing order of likelihood...

108
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,871
...are Hirschsprung's disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm...

109
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:28,846
...or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

110
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:32,679
When would you have accidentally eaten
chrysanthemum blossoms?

111
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,879
It's part of an unlikely scenario
that involves sleepwalking...

112
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:39,424
...in a 24-hour flower mart
with a less than vigilant proprietor.

113
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,619
Oh, Lord, my belly.

114
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,428
Ever had your appendix out?

115
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,193
I haven't. I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

116
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,798
Let's get you to the hospital.

117
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,938
So this is how it ends.

118
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,302
With cruel irony.

119
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,070
Just as I make the commitment
to preserving my body...

120
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:01,875
...I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

121
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:05,375
Do you know the original purpose
of the appendix, Leonard?

122
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:07,145
- No.
- I do.

123
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:10,155
And yet I'm doomed while you live on.

124
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:14,156
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

125
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,924
Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst.

126
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,838
On the other hand,
it might have been the Brussels sprouts.

127
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,440
- Good night.
- Good night.

128
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:35,044
Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.

129
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:41,255
Penny. Penny. Penny.

130
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:44,152
Coming, coming.

131
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,122
Hey, nice knees.

132
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:49,354
- Thank you. They're my mother's.
- Oh.

133
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,067
And the Flash shirt is what?
Because you're gonna run fast?

134
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,532
No.
The Flash shirt is because it's Friday.

135
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,433
But it's nice when things work out.

136
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:00,335
- Heart rate monitor?
- Don't have one.

137
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,203
- Your pedometer?
- Don't have one.

138
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,276
- Telematics connected to an iPod?
- Uh, nope.

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,504
What do you do?

140
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,980
You just go out there
and gambol about like a bunny?

141
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:14,087
No, I just run till I'm hungry
and then I stop for a bear claw.

142
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:21,989
- Why are you doing that?
- It's good to stretch before you run.

143
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,221
All right.

144
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,432
Let's start with a toe touch.

145
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,233
Okay, you do it.

146
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:36,667
I am doing it.

147
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:39,235
Oh, wow. Good job.

148
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:42,611
Okay, um, can you do this?

149
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,883
We'll never know.

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,179
Okay, let's just, uh, warm up on the run.

151
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,413
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

152
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,922
Yeah,
I've been reading up on biomechanics.

153
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,684
I think you'll be surprised at my...

154
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,192
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I think so.

155
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,494
- Oh, let me help you up.
- Thank you.

156
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,768
Oh, Sheldon.

157
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,736
If it makes you feel any better...

158
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,777
...Thursday is no longer
cruciferous vegetable night.

159
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,515
Here's my chicken curry.

160
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,844
- Howard, your shrimp biryani.
- Thank you, sir.

161
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,044
- Palak paneer, that's Penny.
- Thanks.

162
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,882
And for Rajesh Koothrappali...

163
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,058
...from whose homeland
these originate...

164
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,227
...one large order
of Chicken McNuggets.

165
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:31,859
- Hey, what's my share?
- Uh, twelve bucks.

166
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,296
- Can I get you after Friday?
- Sure.

167
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,059
What am I up to now?

168
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,739
Well, okay, uh,
with the Indian food, the pizza...

169
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,968
...the Thai food, the tank of gas,
the frozen yogurt and your rent...

170
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:44,577
...uh...

171
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,078
...a little over $1400.

172
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:53,745
- What now?
- He's just expressing his admiration.

173
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,947
You don't even have to put out
to get free stuff.

174
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,021
It's not free. I'm gonna pay him back.

175
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,763
Shut up!

176
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,730
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

177
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,633
Coming.

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,945
Greetings, friends.

179
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,954
Greetings, whatever the hell you are.

180
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,356
I am a mobile virtual presence device.

181
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,187
Recent events
have demonstrated to me...

182
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:41,927
...that my body is too fragile
to endure the vicissitudes of the world.

183
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:46,036
Until such time as I am able
to transfer my consciousness...

184
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,971
...I shall remain in a secure location
and interact with the world...

185
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:51,805
...in this manner.

186
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:56,546
Really? That's your question?
When did he put a ramp in?

187
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,822
You're in my spot.

188
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:20,966
This may seem a little odd at first...

189
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,302
...but over time,
you'll grow accustomed...

190
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,845
...to dealing with me
in this configuration.

191
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,710
Yeah, to be honest,
I don't see much difference.

192
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,977
Thank you.
That's what I was going for.

193
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,858
Now, Leonard,
tomorrow when we go to work...

194
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,586
...you'll need to allow some extra time
to get me down the stairs.

195
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,232
For your convenience,
I disassemble into four pieces.

196
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,561
This is ridiculous.
I'm coming to talk to you.

197
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,670
You don't know where I am.

198
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,569
My physical body
is safely ensconced...

199
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:57,506
...in a secure, undisclosed location.

200
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,104
You're in your bedroom.

201
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,814
No, I'm not.

202
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:03,882
I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

203
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,213
No, you can't.

204
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:12,024
Wait. Come back.

205
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:13,217
Halt.

206
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:16,261
Authorized personnel only.

207
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:22,130
So either one of you weirdoes wanna
buy my underwear? Only 1400 bucks.

208
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,800
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

209
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,466
I'm behind you.

210
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:33,546
Please look at me
when you're talking to me.

211
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,413
I am looking at you.

212
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,383
No, you're not.
Pay no attention to that man in the bed.

213
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:41,784
You cannot exist
as a virtual presence.

214
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,617
Not here and certainly not at work.

215
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,622
Oh, good God.

216
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,990
At my age, do you know
how I'm statistically most likely to die?

217
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,256
At the hands of your roommate?

218
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,893
An accident.

219
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,297
Well,
that's how I'm gonna make it look.

220
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:59,803
Until I can transfer my intellect
to a more durable container...

221
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,966
...my body will remain safely ensconced
in my bed.

222
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,111
Fine, but don't expect my help.

223
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:07,645
You have to help.
It's in the roommate agreement.

224
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:08,974
No, it's not.

225
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:13,850
Section 74-C.

226
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,854
The various obligations and duties
of the parties...

227
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:19,458
...in the event
one of them becomes a robot.

228
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,993
I'll be damned.

229
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,374
- This is delightful.
- Uh-huh.

230
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,771
It's much easier to enjoy
the picturesque route we travel to work...

231
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:44,975
...when you remove the specter
of fiery vehicular death.

232
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,911
Refresh my memory.
Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?

233
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,819
Because I called shotgun, remember?

234
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,317
Right.

235
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,034
You seem tense.

236
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,598
Perhaps this will relax you.

237
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:14,571
I don't wanna listen to music,
Sheldon.

238
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,309
Very well.

239
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,255
I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.

240
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,325
Together in this car
with my enhanced capabilities...

241
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:29,088
...we're like Knight Rider.

242
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,897
Except in Knight Rider,
the car isn't a yammering sphincter.

243
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:38,566
You mock the sphincter,
but the sphincter is a class of muscle...

244
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,402
...without which human beings
couldn't survive.

245
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:48,343
There are over 50 different sphincters
in the human body.

246
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,484
How many can you name?

247
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,919
I was wrong.
This is exactly like Knight Rider.

248
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,847
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.

249
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,049
No.

250
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,287
This is a photograph
of the 1911 Solvay Conference...

251
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,930
...on the theory
of radiation and quanta.

252
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:08,694
Using Photoshop,
I've introduced a few anachronisms.

253
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,996
See if you can spot all 24.

254
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,536
I'll give you the first one.

255
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:17,205
Madame Curie should not be wearing
a digital watch.

256
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:18,936
And go.

257
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:22,577
That's it. Bye-bye.

258
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,651
Bazinga!

259
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,583
I have an override switch.

260
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,151
I almost died.

261
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:37,922
Yeah, and I'm safe and sound in bed.
Who's crazy now?

262
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:40,726
I'm still gonna go with you.

263
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,007
Hello, Professor Hoskins.

264
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,610
Nice to see you, Mindy.

265
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,475
Konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.

266
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,141
Sorry, the Swedes
disproved your theory.

267
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,786
Leonard, my door.

268
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,052
What about it?

269
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,787
Be a lamb and open it for me.

270
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,630
Why? What's the problem?

271
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,635
You think you have me stymied,
don't you?

272
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,936
No, I think a doorknob
has you stymied.

273
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:29,549
Oh, look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.

274
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:35,211
That's my joke, I told it last night.
You can't just use it.

275
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,818
Raj, be a lamb
and open the door for me.

276
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,618
Oh, sure.

277
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:46,833
He's a lamb, you're not.

278
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,462
I'm a lamb.

279
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:56,166
Isn't this nice?

280
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,006
The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie...

281
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:03,172
...without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.

282
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:07,184
I say we just take him to Tatooine
and sell him to some Jawas, heh.

283
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:10,422
That's two, dude.
Write your own jokes.

284
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:14,694
Oh, great.

285
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,021
- Hi, I'm Penny. I'll be your waitress.
- Why are you introducing yourself?

286
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:23,636
I'd rather people not know I have any
prior connection to you whatsoever.

287
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,863
Can you tell me the specials
this evening?

288
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:28,234
- Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.
- Obviously.

289
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,570
I don't even have water yet.

290
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,211
Because you're not here.

291
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,439
That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

292
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,579
I'm going to have to go
over your head.

293
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,419
Manager?

294
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,455
Manager?

295
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:47,923
Oh, Lord, look who it is.

296
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:52,165
- Is that Steve Wozniak?
- I think it is.

297
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:54,732
The great and powerful Woz.

298
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:59,099
Penny, Steve Wozniak was one
of the co-founders of Apple computer.

299
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:00,399
He and Steve Jobs...

300
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:03,304
Yeah, I know who he is.
I watch Dancing With the Stars.

301
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,575
I must speak to him.

302
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,804
Of course you must.

303
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:13,983
There's an Olive Garden down the street.
You guys should try it sometime.

304
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,621
Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?

305
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,283
Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.

306
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:23,930
Thank you.
I just wanna say I'm a big fan.

307
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:27,761
You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.

308
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,435
Only 15th?

309
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,834
It's still six spots above Steve Jobs.

310
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,304
I care neither for turtlenecks
nor showmanship.

311
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:40,605
Yeah,
I never got that turtleneck thing.

312
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:45,445
One of my proudest possessions
is a vintage 1977 Apple II.

313
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,986
Despite the file system limitations
of Apple DOS 3.3...

314
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,488
...it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.

315
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,488
Thanks, we were shooting for nifty.

316
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:57,961
You know, if you had it here,
I'd autograph it for you.

317
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:00,363
Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes...

318
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,230
...depending on how the busses
are running.

319
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,269
Nerds.

320
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:13,010
I'm coming, Woz. I'm coming.

321
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,238
Ah!

322
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,512
Aw.

323
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,298
Penny.

324
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:36,095
Penny.

325
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,635
Penny.

326
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,807
What up, Shel-Bot?

327
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,001
I can't get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.

328
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,770
Well, what do you want me to do?

329
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:49,074
Sing me "Soft Kitty."

330
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:53,409
Really? You want me to sing "Soft Kitty"
to a computer monitor?

331
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,252
Would you rather come
sing it to me in person?

332
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,585
Soft kitty, warm kitty

333
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
Little ball of fur

334
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,997
Closer to the microphone.

335
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,294
Happy kitty, sleepy...

336
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,299
No.

337
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,768
You have to start over.

338
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,007
Softy kitty, warm kitty

339
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,175
Little ball of fur

340
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:22,782
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

341
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,544
Purr, purr, purr
