1
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,539
What time is he coming?

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,560
Any time. Should be here now.

3
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,229
- Perhaps something's happened to him.
- You think he's missed his bus?

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,390
No, no, no.

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,900
I mean something may have...happened.

6
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,459
Who is he, exactly?

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,230
All I know is he's an army officer with something
to tell me he wouldn't divulge on the phone.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,959
- It's probably nothing.
- Perhaps.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,540
Remember Churchill, the wilderness years?

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,780
He found out about our military inadequacy
from army officers.

11
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,379
So while he was in the wilderness
he could leak stories to the press

12
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,890
and embarrass the government. I could do that!

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,810
But you're IN the government.

14
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,879
Oh, yes!

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,359
(DOORBELL)

16
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,260
I'll get it.

17
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,799
- Major Saunders?
- Yes, sir.

18
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,680
Come in.

19
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,629
Follow me.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,819
- It's all right. My wife, Annie.
- Good evening.

21
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,020
- Drink?
- Thanks.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,560
- Scotch?
- Thanks.

23
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,490
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,949
- No need to keep thanking me.
- Thanks. I mean, sorry.

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,789
- No need to apologise, either.
- Sorry. I mean, thanks.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,330
- Shall I go and let you talk in private?
- Please stay, if that's OK with you.

27
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,569
- Yes. No secrets from Annie. I tell her everything.
- Several times, usually!

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,599
- So, is this highly confidential?
- It is, rather, yes.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,259
- Shall I turn on the radio?
- Is there something good on?

30
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,300
- In case we're being bugged.
- Oh. Is that likely?

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,939
- Who's in charge of bugging politicians?
- Ah...

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,729
Yes, come to think of it, I am.

33
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,849
That's all right, then.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Could I say that what I'm about
to tell you I'm telling you on a personal basis?

35
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,180
Fine...What do you mean, exactly?

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,050
I'm telling you personally
and not as Minister for Administrative Affairs.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,750
- But I am Minister of Administrative Affairs.
- But I'm not telling you in that role.

38
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,150
- I'm telling you as a journalist.
- Journalist? I thought you were an army officer?

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,469
- No, YOU'RE a journalist.
- I'm a minister.

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,650
But what were you
before you became a minister?

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,770
Your starter for ten, no conferring!

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,610
I get your drift.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,030
You're telling me what you're telling me,
though I don't know yet what you're telling me,

44
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,830
as the former editor of ''Reform''.

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Yes. You were a very fine editor.

46
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,110
- I wouldn't say that.
- You've often said that!

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,509
But how do I prevent myself, as a minister, from
knowing what you'll tell me as a former editor?

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,650
I can't prevent the minister from knowing.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,539
- He means it's a question of hats.
- Yes.

50
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm not wearing my ministerial hat tonight,
but I ought to warn you,

51
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,259
if I need to be told what you tell me, I shan't
hesitate in my duty to keep myself informed!

52
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,439
Fine. Now, who's in charge
of selling British weapons to foreigners?

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,439
- Bzzz. Hacker, LSE.
- Shut up, Annie.

54
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,899
You wrote an article in ''Reform'' about the sale
of British weapons to undesirable foreigners.

55
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,079
Yes, it was called ''The Dreadful Trade''.

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,420
Perfectly patriotic to manufacture arms
for our own defence or our allies'.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,610
Although not all our allies are very commendable.

58
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,019
But we must not sell weapons to bolster
the regimes of foreign despots, Nazi dictators...

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,529
- Or terrorists.
- Terroris... Terrorists?

60
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,910
Terrorists. As I told you,
I've recently returned from Rome.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,860
- NATO, wasn't it?
- A military delegation to NATO.

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,329
While I was there, they showed me something
they'd captured in a raid on a terrorist HQ.

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,800
It was a computerised bomb detonator.
Very new, very secret, and very lethal.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
- Who showed it to you?
- I can't possibly say. It's a confidence.

65
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,810
I see. Computerised bomb detonator?

66
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,959
You set it to calculate the weight of the victim,
speed of his car, so you're sure to get him,

67
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,899
and you can reprogram it remotely,
by radio, after setting it.

68
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,329
Gosh. I don't associate Italians
with that sort of technology!

69
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,079
- It wasn't made in Italy. It was made here.
- Made in Britain?

70
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,810
Under a Ministry of Defence contract
and paid for by the British taxpayer.

71
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,939
- And used by Italian terrorists?
- Yes.

72
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,970
- Where did they get them?
- That's what I want to know.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,620
You haven't told anybody else?

74
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,240
If I make an official report,
I have to disclose my sources.

75
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,470
But if I tell someone
near the top of government...

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,279
Er, AT the top, actually.

77
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,569
Yes...that secret British equipment
was being supplied to Italian terrorists,

78
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,629
- then he would, er...
- Absolutely.

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,910
What would he?

80
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,560
Find out how it's being done. The investigation
would have to start in Britain at the top level.

81
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,730
Fine.

82
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,660
But you told me you were telling me
on a personal level.

83
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,269
Yes, but now you know personally, if not officially,
you can use your personal knowledge

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,329
to start official investigations
to get official confirmation of personal suspicions

85
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,990
so what you now know personally,
but not officially,

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,439
you will then know officially as well as personally.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,910
You're not related to Sir Humphrey Appleby
by any chance?

88
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,480
- Who?
- Never mind!

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,689
- I felt I had to tell someone.
- Absolutely.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,360
Well, now I know, personally.

91
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,870
Marvellous. Going to do something
about it, aren't you?

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,850
- Absolutely, indeed I am.
- Right away?

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,970
Right away.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,750
What are you going to do?

95
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,069
I'm going to think
about what you've told me. Right away.

96
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,860
- And then?
- Then I will consider various courses of action.

97
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,779
- Without delay.
- You'll take action without delay.

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,750
- I will consider taking action without delay.
- Are you related to Sir Humphrey Appleby?

99
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,680
- Like another drink?
- No, I must be off.

100
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,459
- Can I rely on you to tackle this shocking matter?
- Indeed you can.

101
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,620
- Goodbye.
- Goodnight.

102
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,180
- Goodnight, Major.
- Goodnight, sir.

103
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,800
- What do you think?
- You'll do something?

104
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I certainly will, if it's right.

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,000
But I can't believe it's true.

106
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,370
Could it happen?

107
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,209
Couldn't. Could it?

108
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,939
It's not just that it shouldn't. It couldn't.
And if it could, it wouldn't. Would it?

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,459
You ARE related to Sir Humphrey Appleby!

110
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,990
Humphrey, I must talk to you about something
which concerns me deeply.

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,830
Really profoundly important.

112
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,600
The amendment to the order on stock control
in government establishments?

113
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,330
The procedure for renewal of local authority
leaseholds in development areas?

114
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,360
No, what concerns me is a great issue
really of life and death.

115
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,370
Shouldn't that wait till after work?

116
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,399
- It is work.
- Really? Please go on.

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,899
How do British armaments manufacturers
sell their arms to foreigners?

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,759
You get an export licence
from the Department of Trade.

119
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,529
Private firms can sell their arms abroad?

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,769
- Companies and government agencies.
- To whom?

121
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,529
- Foreign governments, usually.
- Is that all?

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,879
Well, sometimes you can sell
to an arms dealer, third party.

123
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,159
A man in Manchester buys
on behalf of a party in the Channel Islands

124
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,419
with contacts in Luxembourg...

125
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,610
There's no real control
over who the arms go to in the end?

126
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,019
Indeed there is. The dealer has to provide
an end user certificate

127
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,490
which is a signature
acceptable to the government

128
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,600
that the ultimate customer is an approved user.

129
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,559
Is that a real guarantee?

130
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,519
Would you be surprised if a British aircraft
carrier turned up in the Central African Republic?

131
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,669
l, for one, Minister, would be very surprised.
It's 1,000 miles inland!

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,580
You know what I mean.
What about smaller weapons?

133
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,659
It's officially impossible. Stringent security,
rigorous inspections, meticulous scrutiny.

134
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,330
You mean it's all a facade?

135
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,559
Ah.

136
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,039
- I think this conversation should end here.
- No, it's as I thought.

137
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,750
A confidential source has disclosed to me that
British arms are being sold to Italian terrorists.

138
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,019
I see. May I ask
who this confidential source was?

139
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,889
Humphrey, I said it was confidential.

140
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,870
Sorry. I naturally assumed
that meant you were going to tell me.

141
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,909
- You don't seem worried.
- It happens all the time. It's not our problem.

142
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,580
So does robbery with violence.
Does that worry you?

143
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,950
No, Minister. Home Office problem.

144
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,620
Humphrey, we're letting terrorists
have murderous weapons!

145
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,379
- WE'RE not.
- Well, who is?

146
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,139
Who knows? Department of Trade?
Ministry of Defence? Foreign Office?

147
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,080
We, Humphrey, the British government.

148
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,320
Innocent lives set at risk by British arms
in the hands of terrorists.

149
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,990
Only Italian lives, not British lives, Minister.

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,649
- Could be British tourists abroad.
- Tourists? Foreign Office problem.

151
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,110
- Humphrey, we have to do something.
- With respect, we have to do nothing.

152
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,220
- What do you mean?
- The sale of arms abroad

153
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,600
is one area of government
we do not examine too closely.

154
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,299
- I have to, now I know.
- Say you don't know.

155
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,320
- Are you suggesting I lie?
- Not you, Minister, no.

156
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,610
- Well, who should lie?
- Sleeping dogs, Minister.

157
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,080
- I'm going to raise this.
- No, I beg you.

158
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,970
A rule of government is never look
into anything you don't have to,

159
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,649
never start an enquiry
unless you know what its findings will be.

160
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,009
I can't believe this!
We're talking about good and evil.

161
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,090
- Church of England problem.
- No, Humphrey!

162
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,429
- Our problem. We are discussing right and wrong.
- I'm not. It's misuse of government time.

163
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,059
- Selling arms to terrorists is wrong.
- Either you sell arms or you don't.

164
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,309
If you sell them,
they end up with people who can afford them.

165
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,100
But not terrorists?

166
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,629
I suppose we could put
a government health warning on the rifle butts!

167
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,509
''This gun can seriously damage your health.''

168
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,610
You may take this lightly, but we cannot close
our eyes to something as morally wrong as this.

169
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,679
If you insist on discussing moral issues,

170
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,269
something is either morally wrong or it isn't.
It can't be slightly morally wrong.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,299
- Don't quibble.
- Government isn't about morality.

172
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,960
- Really? What is it about?
- Stability. Keeping things going.

173
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,440
Preventing anarchy. Stopping society
falling to bits. Still being here tomorrow.

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,149
- What for?
- I beg your pardon?

175
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,620
What is the purpose of government
if not for doing good?

176
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,850
Government isn't about good and evil.
It's about order or chaos.

177
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,490
It's in order for Italian terrorists
to get British bombs?

178
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
- You don't care?
- It's not my job to care.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
That's what politicians are for.
My job is to carry out policy.

180
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,539
- Even if you think it's wrong?
- Almost all government policy is wrong, but...

181
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,529
..frightfully well carried out!

182
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,409
Have you ever known a civil servant
resign on a matter of principle?

183
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,269
I should think not! What an appalling suggestion!

184
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,250
For the first time, I fully understand that you
are purely committed to means and not ends!

185
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,580
As far as I'm concerned, and all my colleagues,
there is no difference between means and ends.

186
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,549
If you believe that, Humphrey, you will go to hell.

187
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,870
Minister, I had no idea you had a theological bent.

188
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,600
- You are a moral vacuum.
- If you say so, Minister.

189
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,149
- Time for your lunch appointment.
- You're keeping very quiet, Bernard.

190
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,789
- What would you do about all this?
- I would keep very quiet.

191
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,490
- So may we drop the matter of arms sales?
- No, we may not!

192
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,450
I'm going to tell the Prime Minister personally.
Make an appointment, Bernard.

193
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,659
This is the sort of thing he wants to know about.

194
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,950
I assure you, this is the sort of thing
he wants NOT to know about.

195
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,919
We shall see about that.

196
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,039
Indeed we will.

197
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,899
What's the matter, Bernard?

198
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,840
- Nothing really, Sir Humphrey.
- You look unhappy.

199
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,639
- I was wondering if the minister was right.
- Very unlikely. What about?

200
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,440
About ends and means.
Will I end up as a moral vacuum, too?

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,559
Oh, I hope so, Bernard.

202
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,870
If you work hard enough.

203
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,600
Makes me feel rather downcast.

204
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,840
If it's our job to carry out government policies,
shouldn't we believe in them?

205
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,909
Oh, what an extraordinary idea!

206
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,850
- Why?
- Bernard...

207
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,080
I have served 11 governments in the past
30 years. If I'd believed in all their policies,

208
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,830
I'd have been passionately committed
to keeping out of the Common Market,

209
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,769
and passionately committed to joining it.

210
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,720
I'd have been utterly convinced
of the rightness of nationalising steel

211
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,679
and of denationalising it and renationalising it.

212
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,500
Capital punishment? I'd have been a fervent
retentionist and an ardent abolitionist.

213
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,629
I'd have been a Keynesian and a Friedmanite,
a grammar school preserver and destroyer,

214
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,379
a nationalisation freak and a privatisation maniac,

215
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,139
but above all, I would have been
a stark-staring raving schizophrenic!

216
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,200
So what do we believe in?

217
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,009
At this moment, Bernard, we believe in stopping
the minister from informing the Prime Minister.

218
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,149
- But why?
- Because once the Prime Minister knows

219
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,389
there will have to be an enquiry, like Watergate.

220
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,889
The investigation of a trivial break-in
led to one ghastly revelation after another

221
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,129
and finally the downfall of a president.

222
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,870
The golden rule is don't lift lids off cans of worms.

223
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,600
- No, Sir Humphrey.
- Everything is connected to everything else.

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,450
- Who said that?
- The Cabinet Secretary?

225
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,919
Nearly right. Actually, it was Lenin.

226
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,970
How do you stop a Cabinet Minister
talking to a Prime Minister?

227
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,159
- Interesting question. You tell me.
- I don't know.

228
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,210
Work it out. You're supposed to be a high-flier.

229
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,970
Or are you really a low-flier
supported by occasional gusts of wind?

230
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,639
Well, YOU can't stop the minister
seeing the PM, can you?

231
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,210
- I can't.
- Nor can the private office at No. 10.

232
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,600
- Correct.
- It has to be someone high up in government.

233
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,480
- Getting warmer.
- Someone close to the PM.

234
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,450
Someone who can frighten the minister...

235
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,590
- The Chief Whip?
- Excellent, you've learnt a lot.

236
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,240
- So, how do you crack the whip?
- I'm sorry?

237
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,339
How do you mobilise the Chief Whip?

238
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,670
The minister's asked me to phone
the PM's private office for an appointment,

239
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,990
so if you had a word with the Cabinet Secretary,

240
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,940
and he had a word with the diary secretary,
and they all had a word with the Whip's office...

241
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,809
..then when the minister arrived, the Whip
could meet him and say the PM is busy

242
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,609
and asked him to have a word
with the minister instead.

243
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,619
Excellent, Bernard.

244
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,309
You should have taken a degree in engineering!

245
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,960
- What are you doing?
- You wanted the Cabinet Secretary.

246
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,069
I do, indeed. Now, do you,
as the minister's private secretary,

247
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,230
feel obliged to tell the minister
of this conversation?

248
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,490
What conversation?

249
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,269
Well done, Bernard. You'll be a moral vacuum yet!

250
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,980
Ah, Jim.

251
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,319
My dear chap, how nice to see you.

252
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,200
- Vic, I was hoping to see the Prime Minister.
- Yes.

253
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,890
The PM's rather busy today.
Asked me to see you instead.

254
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,730
Vic, it's not a matter for the Chief Whip.

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,990
The PM asked me to have a preliminary
conversation and write a background note.

256
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,849
- Save time later.
- Oh.

257
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,039
Well, I've been given
some pretty dramatic information.

258
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,910
Go on.

259
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,589
The Italian Red Terrorists are being supplied
with top secret bomb detonators

260
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,170
made in this country, in a government factory.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,359
- And you feel you should tell the PM?
- Yes, the PM's head of security.

262
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,529
I don't think it's anything
to burden the PM with. Let's hold it over.

263
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,140
- Forget all about it?
- That's my recommendation.

264
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,609
I'm sorry, Vic, I can't accept it.
The PM must be told.

265
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,619
- If the PM is told, there'd have to be an enquiry.
- Exactly.

266
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,220
Perhaps revealing other undesirable -
even hostile - governments

267
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,920
- had been supplied with British-made arms.
- Seriously?

268
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,000
Perhaps. It might be highly embarrassing
to our Cabinet colleagues -

269
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,890
Foreign Secretary, Defence Secretary,
Trade Secretary, and to the PM personally.

270
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
Doing the right thing might be embarrassing
sometimes, but that's no reason for not doing it.

271
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,569
You know we already sell arms
to Syria, Chile, Iran?

272
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,109
- It's officially approved.
- You like what they do with them?

273
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,069
Well, obviously not entirely.

274
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,490
- Either you're in the arms business or you're not!
- If being in it means arming terrorists,

275
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,069
- we should be out, it's immoral.
- Oh, great!

276
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,000
Great!

277
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,769
Is it moral to put 100,000 British workers
out of a job?

278
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,099
And exports, two billion a year gone, for starters.

279
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,059
And votes? Where do you think the government
places those weapons contracts?

280
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,240
- In marginal constituencies, obviously.
- Exactly.

281
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,599
All I'm saying is that now that I know,
the Prime Minister must be told.

282
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,819
- Why?
- Why?

283
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,079
Just because you've caught something nasty,
why do you have to breathe over everyone?

284
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,130
Are you happy in the Cabinet?

285
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,299
- Yes, of course I am!
- Do you want to stay in it?

286
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,730
(HE GULPS)

287
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,599
Well, then?

288
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,309
Sorry, Vic, but there is such a thing as duty.

289
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,769
- Sometimes one must follow one's conscience.
- For God's sake.

290
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,579
Must you flash about your petty little conscience?
Don't you think anybody else has got one?

291
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,250
- Have you no conscience for the government?
- Of course!

292
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,779
The PM is on the verge of signing
an international anti-terrorist agreement.

293
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,900
- I didn't know.
- There's a lot you don't know.

294
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Can't you see it's essential
to deal with major policy

295
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,910
rather than a few arms exporters and terrorists?

296
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,279
Yes, I suppose it is
just a couple of terrorist groups.

297
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,720
- Can't kill that many people, can they?
- Suppose not!

298
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,140
And you want to blow it all
in a fit of moral self-indulgence!

299
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,990
After all, with the PM thinking about you
as the next Foreign Secretary...

300
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,259
Do you mean that?

301
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,900
Good Lord!

302
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,539
So if you want to martyr yourself,
go ahead and press for an enquiry.

303
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,690
Feel free to jeopardise everything
we've worked for all these years.

304
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,819
No, no. Obviously it's appalling if Italian
terrorists are getting hold of British weapons,

305
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,460
but there is such a thing as loyalty,
the common purpose.

306
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,019
I suppose one must see these things
in a proper perspective.

307
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,809
- If it was the Ministry of Defence, Board of Trade.
- Ministry of Defence, Board of Trade problem.

308
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,029
Foreign Office problem. I can see that now.

309
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,910
So we can hold it over for the time being?

310
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,839
- Don't want to upset and embarrass the PM!
- Absolutely not. Definitely not. No.

311
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,339
Sorry I mentioned it.

312
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,549
Good man!

313
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,140
So I thought on balance
it was best to leave it at that.

314
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,480
Let sleeping dogs lie...

315
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,630
In the wider interest.

316
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,319
As a loyal member of the government.

317
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,180
- Nothing to be gained. Opening a can of worms.
- The major said they were terrorists.

318
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,809
Yes, well...

319
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,710
- We bombed Dresden. We're all terrorists.
- No.

320
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,900
I mean metaphorically.
You should meet the Chief Whip. He certainly is!

321
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
- Someone in Britain's giving bombs to murderers.
- Selling, not giving.

322
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,529
- That makes it OK?
- Be serious, Annie.

323
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,279
An investigation might uncover all sorts.

324
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,109
I see. Investigate if you can catch one criminal,
but not if you might catch lots!

325
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,619
If they're your Cabinet colleagues, you're right!

326
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,940
Government is a very complex business, Annie.
There are so many conflicting considerations.

327
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,480
- Whether to do the right thing or wrong thing.
- Exactly. No...

328
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,259
What do you suggest I do?

329
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,039
- Take a moral stand.
- How?

330
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,400
- Threaten resignation.
- They'd accept it!

331
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,680
Then where would I be?

332
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,519
If I'm gone, I'm not in a position
to do any good any more.

333
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,670
- You're not doing good now.
- Resignation may be a sop to our consciences,

334
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,809
but it won't stop terrorists getting British bombs.

335
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,990
- It might if you tell what you know.
- What do I know?

336
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,579
I've no hard facts. I know it's going on
because nobody's denied it, but that's not proof.

337
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,690
Can't you see? I'm in a real fix.

338
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,799
I don't think you realise just how real a fix
you're in. This letter arrived today.

339
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,079
From Major Saunders.

340
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,000
''Dear Mr Hacker. Thank you for seeing me.

341
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,680
''Such a relief to have told you about the supply
of British weapons to Italian terrorists.

342
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,130
''I know you will act upon this information
as you promised

343
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,180
''and I look forward to seeing some action taken.''

344
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,359
You see?

345
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,109
What will you do when Major Saunders tells the
world he told you about it and you did nothing?

346
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,549
- It's a photocopy. He's got the original.
- It was recorded delivery, so you did get it.

347
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm trapped!

348
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,259
Completely trapped!
I can't tell the PM, I can't NOT tell the PM.

349
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,640
- I see.
- Might we not use the Rhodesia Solution?

350
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,220
Bernard, you excel yourself!
Of course, Minister, the Rhodesia Solution!

351
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,819
- What's that?
- Oil sanctions.

352
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,400
A member of the government
was told about sanction-busting.

353
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,470
- What did he do?
- Told the PM.

354
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,720
- And?
- He told the PM in a way the PM didn't hear him.

355
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,920
Oh. Do you mean I should mumble it
in the Division Lobby?

356
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,769
- No, Minister, you write a note.
- Very faint pencil?

357
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,779
- Please, be practical.
- It's awfully obvious.

358
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,900
- Write a note susceptible of misinterpretation.
- Oh, I see!

359
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,859
''Dear Prime Minister
I believe Italian Red Terrorists

360
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,269
''have secret British bomb-making
equipment.'' How do you misinterpret that?

361
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,210
You can't. So you don't write that.

362
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,299
You use a more circumspect style
with no mention of bombs or terrorists.

363
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,329
- Isn't that what it's all about?
- Bernard, write this down.

364
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,039
''My attention has been drawn to information
which suggests possible irregularities under...''

365
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,269
Section 1 of the Import, Export
and Customs Powers Defence Act 1939c.

366
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,279
Thank you, Bernard.

367
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,970
You then suggest that somebody else
should do something about it.

368
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,720
''Evidence suggests
there may be a case for further investigation

369
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,990
''to establish whether enquiries
should be put in hand.''

370
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,619
Then you smudge it all over.

371
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,940
''Nevertheless, it should be stressed
that available information is limited

372
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,970
''and facts could be difficult to establish
with any certainty.''

373
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,410
- I see.
- If there's an enquiry, you'd be in the clear

374
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,930
and everybody would understand the busy
PM might not have grasped the implications.

375
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,079
- They certainly would! That's most unclear.
- Thank you, Minister!

376
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,670
You arrange for the letter to arrive at No. 10
on the day the PM has an overseas summit!

377
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,730
So there is also doubt about whether it was
the PM or the acting PM who read the note.

378
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,660
It's seen as a breakdown in communication
everyone's cleared and can get on with things.

379
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,450
- Including the Red Terrorists!
- Exactly...Bernard!

380
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,430
I'll tell you about government.

381
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,369
You must always try to do the right thing.

382
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,210
But you must never let anybody
catch you trying to do it

383
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,369
because doing right's wrong. Right?

384
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,670
- Haven't you had enough, darling?
- There's still some left in the bottle.

385
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,809
No, the thing about government is principle.

386
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,009
And the principle is you mustn't rock the boat...

387
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,509
..because if you do,
all the little consciences will fall out.

388
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,799
And you must all hang together.

389
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,279
Because if you don't hang together,
you'll all be hanged separately.

390
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,069
I'm hanged if I'll be hanged!

391
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,069
You know...politics is about helping others.

392
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,960
Even if that means helping terrorists.

393
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,809
Terrorists are others, aren't they?
Not us, are they?

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,150
No.

395
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,190
And you must always follow your conscience,
but you must know where you're going.

396
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,130
So you can't follow your conscience.

397
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,619
'Cause it may not be going
the same way that you are.

398
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,589
Empty... Like me.

399
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,289
- I'm a moral vacuum.
- Cheer up, darling!

400
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,650
Nothing good comes out of Whitehall.
You did what you could.

401
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,970
- You don't really mean that.
- I do.

402
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,849
- I'm just like Humphrey and the rest.
- That's not true!

403
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,740
He's lost his sense of right and wrong.
You've still got yours.

404
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,309
- Have l?
- It's just that you don't use it much.

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,180
You're a sort of whisky priest, you at least know
when you've done the wrong thing.

406
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,240
- Whisky priest?
- That's right.

407
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,299
Good.

408
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,940
- Let's open another bottle.
- We haven't got one.

409
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,700
That's what you think!

410
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,579
Who said nothing good
ever came out of Whitehall?

411
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,450
- You want one?
- Yes, Minister.
