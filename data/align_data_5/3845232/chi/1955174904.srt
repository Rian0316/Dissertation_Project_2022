00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,460
"第二次阿富汗战争 给很多人
"The Second Afghan War brought

177
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,470
带来了荣誉和晋升的机会
honours and promotion to many.

178
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,560
但对我来说 这只是一场不幸和灾难"
But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster."

179
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,860
没事了 上尉
All right, Captain.

180
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,190
"我拖着毁坏的身体 回到了英国
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined

181
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,400
我的前途一片渺茫
And my future bleak.

182
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
在这种情况下
Under such circumstances,

183
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,650
我自然而然地 被吸引到了伦敦
I naturally gravitated to London.

184
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,440
伦敦这个污水坑里 集聚了国内所有..."
That great cesspool into which all the loungers..."

185
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
- 华生 - "游手好闲的懒汉"
- Watson! - "And idlers of the empire are drained."

186
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,480
华生
Watson!

187
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,990
我是斯坦福德
Stamford.

188
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,570
还记得我吗
Remember?

189
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,980
我们在圣巴特医院共事过
We were at Barts together.

190
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,550
我当然记得 你是斯坦福德
Yes, of course. Stamford.

191
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,380
我的天 你去哪里了
Good Lord! Where have you been?

192
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,270
你现在骨瘦如柴的
You're as thin as a rake!

193
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,610
我顺利回家了 很多人牺牲在了战场上
I made it home. Many weren't so lucky.

194
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,780
- 你现在怎么样 - 我需要找一个住处
- So what now? - I need a place to live.

195
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,410
一个体面 我又能承担的地方 并不容易找到
Somewhere decent at an affordable price. It's not easy.

196
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,230
今天你是第二个 跟我说这话的人
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.

197
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,210
第一个人是谁
Hmm? Who was the first?

198
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,840
我的天啊
Good Lord.

199
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,560
看来他在做实验
It's an experiment, apparently.

200
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,290
他鞭挞尸体是为了证明
Beating corpses to establish

201
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,980
死后的淤青能存在多长时间
how long after death bruising is still possible.

202
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,720
从医学角度看 他这样做有什么意义吗
Is there a medical point to that?

203
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,020
我不知道
Not sure.

204
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,230
我也不知道 你的朋友在哪里
Neither am I. So, where's this friend of yours, then?

205
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,060
打扰了
Excuse me.

206
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,180
希望我们没有打扰到你
I do hope we're not interrupting.

207
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,360
我觉得你去过阿富汗
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.

208
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,560
华生医生 这位是夏洛克先生...
Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock...

209
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,880
优秀的反应能力 你是个不错的人选
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

210
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,910
抱歉 您说什么
I'm sorry...?

211
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,980
我看中了摄政公园附近的一间套房
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.

212
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,460
我们俩一起 可以承担房租
Between us we could afford them.

213
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,010
租房 我们没提过租房的事情啊
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms?

214
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,600
今早我提过此事
I did, I mentioned it this morning,

215
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,090
我需要一名同住的房客
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

216
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,270
午饭后 斯坦福德就出现在这里
Now he appears after lunch

217
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,990
还带着一名参过军的男子
in the company of a man of military aspect

218
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,340
你黝黑的皮肤 和近期的伤病表明
with a tan and a recent injury, both suggestive

219
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,100
你参加过阿富汗战役 并被迫离开战场
of the campaign in Afghanistan and an enforced departure from it.

220
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,090
结论自然就出来了
The conclusion seemed inescapable.

221
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,800
明晚 我们再敲定细节
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.

222
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
我先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

223
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,570
在旺兹沃思有场绞刑
I have a hanging in

224
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,760
我不喜欢他们在我没到之前开场
Wandsworth and I'd hate them to start without me.

225
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,590
- 绞刑 - 这是我的职业兴趣
- A hanging? - I take a professional interest.

226
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,190
我还喜欢拉小提琴和抽烟斗
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.

227
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,210
你应该不会介意吧
I presume that's not a problem.

228
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,890
不会
Er, no, well...

229
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,590
而且很明显 你习惯不把话说完
And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting

230
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,380
我们会相处得很好
to the end of a sentence. We'll get along splendidly.

231
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,720
那我们明晚七点见
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.

232
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,050
对了 我叫夏洛克·福尔摩斯
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

233
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,800
套房地址是贝克街221B号
and the address is 221B, Baker Street.

234
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,130
他一直是这副样子
Yes... he's always been like that.

235
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,150
报纸 卖报纸
Papers! Papers!

236
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,420
报纸 卖报纸
Papers! Papers!

237
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,000
- "蓝宝石奇案" 卖得好吗 - 非常好 华生医生
- Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing? - Very popular, Dr. Watson.

238
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,460
下个月还会有正式的谋杀案吗
Is there going to be a proper murder next month?

239
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,620
我会去找警察和罪犯谈谈
I'll have a word with the criminal classes.

240
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,230
如果您不介意
If you wouldn't mind.

241
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,600
是他吗 他在车里吗
Is that him? Is he in there?

242
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,120
不
Ow! No.

243
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,980
不 他不在 祝您过得愉快 再见
No, no, not at all. Er, good day to you.

244
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,680
启程吧
Let on, walk.

245
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,890
圣诞节快乐 福尔摩斯先生
Merry Christmas, Mr. Holmes!

246
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,290
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes!

247
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,340
我希望您计划要回家之时 能通知我一声
I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home!

248
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,200
我自己都不清楚呢 哈德森夫人
I hardly knew myself, Mrs. Hudson.

249
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,830
那些被肢解的乡绅是个麻烦事
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.

250
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,520
众所周知 他们的时间很难安排
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.

251
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,310
- 箱子里面是什么 - 没什么
- What's in there? - Never mind.

252
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,690
谢谢
Thank you.

253
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,520
你抓住凶手了吗 福尔摩斯先生
Did you catch the murderer, Mr. Holmes?

254
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,340
抓住凶手了 但还在找乡绅们的腿
Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.

255
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,890
我们算是打成平手了吧
I think we'll call it a draw.

256
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,750
我注意到
And I noticed you've

257
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,130
你又发表了一个故事 华生医生
published another of your stories, Dr. Watson.

258
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,670
- 是的 你喜欢那个故事吗 - 不
- Yes, did you enjoy it? - No.

259
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,330
- 我一直不喜欢那些故事 - 为什么不喜欢呢
- I never enjoy them. - Why not?

260
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,730
我从来都没台词 对不对
Well, I never say anything, do I?

261
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,750
在你笔下
According to you, I just show

262
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,060
我只负责带人上楼 还有给你们送早餐
people up the stairs and serve you breakfasts.

263
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,540
在故事里
Well, within the narrative,

264
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,780
总得来说 那是你的职能
that is, broadly speaking, your function.

265
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,350
我的什么
My what?!

266
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,980
别觉得被针对了 哈德森夫人
Don't feel singled out, Mrs. Hudson,

267
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,240
我在狗的那篇故事里 几乎没说话
I'm hardly in the dog one.

268
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,290
"狗的那篇故事"
"The dog one?"

269
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,220
我是你们的女房东 不是一个情节设定
I'm your landlady, not a plot device.

270
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,780
你是指 "巴斯克维尔的猎犬"那个故事吗
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

271
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,560
你们还把套房弄得又暗又脏
And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.

272
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,700
怪插画家去吧 他才完全失控了
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control!

273
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,490
我还得留这种胡子 好让大家认出我来
I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.

274
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,470
"这么多年来 我很荣幸可以记录
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record

275
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,180
我了不起的朋友 夏洛克·福尔摩斯的成就
The exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

276
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,050
有时在他众多的案件中 我很难
It has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many

277
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,020
找出能呈献给读者的故事
Cases to set before my readers.

278
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,600
有些案件太敏感 无法详细描述
Some are still too sensitive to recount,

279
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,860
而有些 则尚存于公众的脑海中
Whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.

280
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,960
但在我们一起经历的 众多冒险之中
But in all our many adventures together,

281
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
还没有哪件案子
no case pushed my friend

282
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,050
像 '可恶的新娘' 那样
To such mental and physical extremes

283
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,400
把我朋友心理 及生理承受力逼到极限"
As that of The Abominable Bride!"

284
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,220
我的天啊
Good Lord!

285
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,530
哈德森夫人 我的客厅里怎么有位女士
Mrs. Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!

286
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,450
是你故意安排的吗
Is it intentional?

287
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,920
她是客户 我说你出去了 但她坚持要等你回来
She's a client. Said you were out, insisted on waiting.

288
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,660
您愿意坐下吗
Would you, er, care to sit down?

289
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
您问她来做什么了吗
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

290
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,390
你自己问她啊
You ask her!

291
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,460
你怎么不问她呢
Why didn't YOU ask her?

292
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,350
我怎么问 我都不能说话
How could I, what with me not talking and everything?!

293
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,660
看在上帝的份上 给她加些台词吧
Oh, for God's sake, give her some lines,

294
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,770
她完全可以饿死我们
she's perfectly capable of starving us!

295
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,790
中午好 我是夏洛克·福尔摩斯
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,

296
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,730
这是我的朋友兼同事 华生医生
this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

297
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,470
您可以在他面前畅所欲言
You may speak freely in front of him,

298
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,010
- 因为基本上他都听不懂 - 福尔摩斯
- as he rarely understands a word. - Holmes!

299
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,080
然而 在您开口之前
However, before you do,

300
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,130
请允许我进行一些微小的观察
allow me to make some trifling observations.

301
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,940
您调皮而富有幽默感
You have an impish sense of humour,

302
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,860
您现在正用这种幽默感
which currently you are

303
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,420
来减轻自己的痛苦
deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.

304
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,040
您不久前嫁给
You have recently married

305
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,080
一个表面上性情温和的男人
a man of a seemingly kindly disposition,

306
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,360
而他为了一个讨厌
who has now abandoned you

307
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,500
而且可疑的同伴抛下了你
for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.

308
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,330
您抱着和解的希望
You have come to this agency as a last resort,

309
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,900
万不得已来到这里
in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.

310
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,540
我的天啊 福尔摩斯
Good Lord, Holmes!

311
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,340
这些都是从您的香水味 推断出来的
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.

312
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,460
她身上的香水味吗
Her perfume?

313
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,000
是的 我从香水味上能得到推理
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me

314
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,250
而你却要面临灾难了
and disaster to you.

315
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,310
你为何这么说
How so?

316
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,290
因为我认出她了 而你却没有
Because I recognised it and you did not.

317
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,770
- 玛丽 - 约翰
- Mary! - John.

318
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,420
天啊 你为什么扮成客户
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client?

319
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,620
因为我想来见自己的丈夫 丈夫
Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.

320
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,110
那件案子是个国际阴谋
It was an affair of international intrigue.

321
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,940
那只是个乡绅谋杀案罢了
It was a murdered country squire.

322
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,460
尽管如此 当时情况很紧急
Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

323
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,310
我不介意你去查案 亲爱的
I don't mind you going, my darling,

324
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,690
我介意的是 你就这样抛下了我
I mind you leaving me behind.

325
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,860
你能帮上什么忙呢
But what could you do?!

326
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,970
那你又帮了什么忙
Well, what do you do,

327
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,580
你不就是一脸惊讶 四处闲逛 记记笔记吗
except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?!

328
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,660
够了
Enough!

329
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,670
舞台已经备好 帷幕已经升起
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

330
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,180
我们要准备开始演出了
We are ready to begin.

331
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,520
开始什么演出
Begin what?

332
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,750
有时若想查明一桩案子 另一桩必先水落石出
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.

333
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,290
- 你又接新案子了吗 - 是一桩很古老的旧案
- Oh, you have a case, then, a new one? - An old one, very old.

334
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,730
我必须深入调查
I shall have to go deep.

335
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
深入调查什么
Deep? Into what?

336
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,310
自身
Myself.

337
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,250
莱斯特雷德 别在门口闲逛了 进来吧
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.

338
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,090
你怎么知道是我
How did you know it was me?

339
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,120
脚步声是无法改变的
The regulation tread is unmistakable.

340
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
你的脚步声比琼斯的轻 但比格雷格森的重
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.

341
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,090
我刚上来 哈德森夫人似乎不愿说话
I... I just came up... Mrs. Hudson didn't seem to be talking.

342
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
恐怕她属于
I fear she has branched

343
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,330
用讽刺手法 批判文学作品的流派
into literary criticism by means of satire.

344
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,840
这是当代女房东的趋势 真令人沮丧
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.

345
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
你为何在下班后过来
What brings you here in your off-duty hours?

346
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,990
- 你怎么知道我下班了 - 自我们开始谈话
- How do you know I'm off duty? - Well, since your arrival,

347
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,870
百分之四十以上的时间 你的眼睛都瞟向酒瓶
you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.

348
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,950
华生 把探长明显想要的东西给他吧
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.

349
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,540
那么 莱斯特雷德 我们能为你做些什么
So... Lestrade, what can we do for you?

350
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,990
我不是来办事的 我就是顺便来看看
Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.

351
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,910
您是指 社交拜访吗
A social call?

352
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,170
是的 我只是来恭贺佳节的
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.

353
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
- 圣诞快乐 - 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

354
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,360
- 圣诞快乐 - 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

355
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,740
寒暄总算结束了
Thank God that's over.

356
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,860
探长 什么奇怪的事情逼着你
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you

357
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,130
来我这里 但你又难以启齿呢
to my door, but embarrasses you to relate?

358
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,240
我没说有事发生啊
Who said anything happened?

359
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,450
你说了 你想方设法地表现出来了
You did. By every means short of actual speech.

360
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,110
福尔摩斯 你推断错了
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.

361
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,220
那么纠正我吧 医生
Then, correct me, Doctor.

362
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,540
他不是想喝酒 他是需要喝酒
He didn't WANT a drink, he needed one.

363
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,250
他不是觉得尴尬 而是感到害怕
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

364
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,800
我的传记者学得很快嘛
My Boswell is learning.

365
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,370
他们真是在飞速成长啊
They do grow up so fast.

366
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,230
华生 让伦敦警察厅重拾勇气吧
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.

367
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,310
探长 请坐下
Inspector, do sit down.

368
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,190
我 我不是在害怕 完全不是
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

369
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,650
恐惧 是面临危险时的一种智慧
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger,

370
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,440
这没有什么好羞耻的
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

371
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
谢谢
Thank you.

372
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,770
那就从头开始 讲这个案子吧
From the beginning, then.

373
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,510
是你
You!

374
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,720
不要 求求你
No, please!

375
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,340
是你吗
You?!

376
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,150
等等
A moment.

377
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,110
什么时候发生的事情
When was this?

378
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,040
昨天早上
Yesterday morning.

379
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,800
新娘的脸是什么样的
The bride's face, how was it described?

380
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,270
"死人般惨白 嘴巴像道深红色的伤口"
"White as death, mouth like a crimson wound."

381
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,430
诗意描写 还是真相如此
Poetry or truth?

382
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,980
很多人认为 这两种方式都一样
Many would say they're the same thing.

383
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,160
对 因为他们都是笨蛋
Yes, idiots.

384
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,180
诗意描写 还是真相如此
Poetry or truth?

385
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,680
事发之后 我亲自查看过她的脸
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

386
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
什么事发之后
After what?

387
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,730
是你
You?

388
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
还是我
Or me?

389
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,620
莱斯特雷德 一个女人当众吞枪自杀
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public

390
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,800
你还要我帮忙识别罪犯
and you need help identifying the guilty party?

391
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,080
伦敦警察厅的智商再创新低
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.

392
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,720
这不是我来这里的原因
That's not why I'm here.

393
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,230
- 我猜也是 - 那个新娘 叫什么
- I surmised. - What was her name, the bride?

394
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,130
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂 昨天是她的结婚纪念日
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.

395
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,060
当然 有人报了警
The police, of course, were called.

396
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,760
她的尸体 也被送去了停尸房
And her body taken to the morgue.

397
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,830
这是标准程序 你究竟为何告诉我们此事
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?

398
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,670
是因为后来 发生了奇怪的事
Because of what happened next.

399
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,010
几个小时之后 在莱姆豪斯
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

400
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,290
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂的丈夫托马斯·瑞克莱蒂
Thomas Ricoletti. Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

401
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,900
我推断 他是要去停尸房 辨认妻子的尸体吧
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains?

402
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,050
而之后 他发现没这个必要了
As it turned out, he was saved the trip.

403
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,220
# 勿忘我 #
Do not forget me

404
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,410
# 勿忘我 #
Do not forget me

405
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,620
# 还记得那个少女吗 #
Remember the maid...

406
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,050
你是谁
Who are you?

407
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,800
# 那个磨坊少女 #
The maid of the mill...

408
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,990
你为什么这样做 你究竟是谁
Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are!

409
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,470
你听出这首歌了吗 亲爱的
You recognise our song, my dear?

410
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,170
我在婚礼上唱过的歌
I sang it at our wedding.

411
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,650
艾美莉亚
Emelia?

412
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,170
你不可能出现在这里 你已经死了
You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died!

413
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,170
我美吗 托马斯
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

414
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,180
是否和你娶我那天一样美
As beautiful as the day you married me?

415
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,550
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is all this about?!

416
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,240
你觉得呢 这位英俊的朋友
What does it look like, my handsome friend?

417
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,790
这是一场枪杆下的婚礼
It's a shotgun wedding.

418
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,660
这场案子中 演绎了两次至死不渝
Till death us do part. Twice in this case.

419
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,890
这案子真是离奇
Extraordinary.

420
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,090
真是难以置信
Impossible.

421
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,900
这案子棒极了
Superb.

422
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,940
当街自杀 诈尸杀人
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.

423
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,080
莱斯特雷德 你会宠坏我们的
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

424
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,270
华生 拿上衣服和帽子
Watson, your hat and coat.

425
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,690
- 我们去哪里 - 去停尸房
- Where are we going? - To the morgue.

426
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,230
一刻也不能耽误
There's not a moment to lose,

427
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,290
虽然很少有人 急着去停尸房
which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

428
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,700
那我就在这里坐着吗
And am I just to sit here?

429
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,500
不用 亲爱的 我们一会就饿了
Not at all, my dear. We'll be hungry later.

430
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,970
福尔摩斯 我有个问题
Holmes, just one thing,

431
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,080
我能穿粗呢衣服 去停尸房吗
tweeds in a morgue?

432
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,700
形势所迫 不得不为 华生
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.

433
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
再会 夫人
Ma'am.

434
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,240
- 我也是竞选的一员 - 什么竞选
- I'm part of a campaign, you know. - Oh, campaign?

435
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,240
- 妇女选举权 -你是支持还是反对
- Votes for women. - And are you for or against?

436
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
出去
Get out.

437
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,030
他们又走了吗
Oh, have they gone off again, have they?

438
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,870
我真不知道 他们过的是什么生活
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.

439
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,990
是啊 这些先生们
Huh, yes. Those gentlemen!

440
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,360
不要在意了
Oh, never you mind.

441
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,470
差点忘了 这是给你的
Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.

442
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,770
哈德森夫人 请您转告我丈夫 我今天晚点回来
Mrs. Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late,

443
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,860
我有点急事
I have some urgent business.

444
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,490
没出什么事吧
Is everything all right?

445
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,820
一个朋友找我帮忙
Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.

446
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,690
什么朋友
Oh, dear. What friend?

447
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,610
英国的朋友
England.

448
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,590
她说得也太含糊了
Well, that's not very specific.

449
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
停尸房今天谁值班
Who's on mortuary duty?

450
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,470
- 你知道的 - 一直是他
- You know who. - Always him.

451
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,910
这是哪个白痴干的
Please tell me which idiot did this!

452
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,530
这是为了大家的安全
It's for everyone's safety.

453
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,030
这女人已经死了 半边脑袋都不见了
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.

454
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,370
她谁都威胁不到
She's not a threat to anyone.

455
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,830
你去跟她丈夫说吧 他就在那边的床单下面
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.

456
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,190
不管昨天晚上 莱姆豪斯发生了什么事
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think

457
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,460
我们都可以假定 绝不是女尸干的
we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.

458
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,850
更离奇的事都发生过
Stranger things have happened.

459
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
比如呢
Such as...?

460
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,200
就是 离奇的事
Well... Strange things.

461
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,820
你这话说得像个孩子
You're speaking like a child.

462
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,100
肯定是活人干的 他去哪了
This is clearly man's work. Where is he?

463
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,890
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

464
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,190
霍珀
Hooper.

465
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,100
你 回去干活
You, back to work!

466
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,100
用你的把戏 来震撼我们吧
So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose?

467
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,770
你需要我注意什么事吗
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?

468
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,690
完全没有 福尔摩斯先生
Nothing at all, Mr. Holmes.

469
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,860
您想待多久都行
You may leave any time you like.

470
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,500
霍珀医生 是我请福尔摩斯先生过来的
Dr. Hooper, I asked Mr. Holmes to come here.

471
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,630
请你配合一点
Cooperate.

472
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,110
这是命令
That's an order.

473
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,890
有"两个特征值得注意"
There are two "Features of interest",

474
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,310
正如你常在 华生医生的故事中所说
as you are always saying in Dr. Watson's stories.

475
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,720
我从没说过这话
I never say that.

476
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,090
你说过 很多次
You do, actually, quite a lot.

477
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,250
首先 这就是艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂的尸体
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

478
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,220
她的身份已经确定
She has been categorically identified.

479
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,470
毋庸置疑 这就是她
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

480
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,560
那昨晚出现在莱姆豪斯的是谁
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?

481
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,640
那位也是艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,470
不可能 她死了 她一直在这里
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.

483
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,320
她丈夫临死之前几秒钟
She was positively identified

484
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,060
才确认过她的身份
by her own husband, seconds before he died.

485
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,890
他没有理由说谎 也不可能搞错
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.

486
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,930
车夫也指认了 那的确就是她
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.

487
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,020
但她不可能 同时出现在两个地方
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she?

488
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,160
没错 华生
No, Watson, one place is

489
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,540
刚离世的人 只能在一个地方出现
strictly the limit for the recently deceased.

490
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,430
我知道了 福尔摩斯
Holmes!

491
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,160
- 她们可能是双胞胎吗 - 不可能
- Could it have been twins? - No.

492
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,140
为什么
Why not?

493
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,930
她就没有双胞胎姐妹
Because it's never twins.

494
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,400
艾美莉亚甚至连同胞姐妹都没有
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.

495
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,180
她有个哥哥 四年前去世了
She had one older brother who died four years ago.

496
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,180
有可能是没公开的孪生姐妹
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

497
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,840
什么
A what?!

498
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,340
没公开的孪生姐妹
A secret twin.

499
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,130
你听懂了吗
Hmm? You know?

500
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,630
就是没人知道的双胞胎
A twin that nobody knows about.

501
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,680
整个案子可能都是策划好的
This whole thing could have been planned.

502
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,570
从怀孕就开始策划吗
Since the moment of conception.

503
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,760
她可真是有远见
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

504
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,690
- 不可能是双胞胎 华生 - 那你怎么看
- It is never twins, Watson! - Then what's your theory?

505
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,090
更重要的一点是 你又是什么毛病
More to the point, what's your problem?

506
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,630
- 你什么意思 - 你在害怕什么
- I... I don't understand... - Why were you so frightened?

507
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,260
目前为止 还无法合理解释 你为何突袭我的酒壶
Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter,

508
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,220
还有你为什么 要让人监禁一具女尸
and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?

509
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,090
这个特征也很值得我们注意
Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.

510
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,010
她手指上有血迹
A smear of blood on her finger.

511
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,550
留下血迹的原因可太多了
That could have happened any number of ways.

512
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,930
没错 还有一件事
Indeed. There's one other thing.

513
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,080
这块血迹 是之后留下的
It wasn't there earlier.

514
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,050
那边的血迹也一样
Neither was that.

515
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,630
是你
You!

516
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,170
还是你
You?

517
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,320
是你吗
You?!

518
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,960
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

519
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,540
吞枪自尽 子弹贯穿头颅
Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain...

520
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,000
后脑被炸得不知去向
Back of the head blown clean off.

521
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,440
他是怎么活下来的
How could he survive?

522
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,460
是"她"吧
"She", you mean.

523
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,330
什么
I'm sorry?

524
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,290
不是"他" 是"她"
Not "He", "She".

525
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,880
对啊 没错
Yes, yes of course.

526
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,750
感谢你们提供这么有趣的案子
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.

527
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,920
破案之后我会发电报给你们 走吧 华生
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.

528
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,080
虽然死因很明显是枪击
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death,

529
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,750
不过肺痨的症状也很明显
but there are clear indicators of consumption.

530
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,210
验尸还是很有必要的
It might be worth a postmortem.

531
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,330
我们得尽可能 多收集一点信息
We need all the information we can get.

532
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,250
老爸一走 他就有火眼金睛了
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone!

533
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,150
在某些方面 我的观察力很敏锐
I AM observant in some ways,

534
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,000
就像福尔摩斯 在某些方面很迟钝一样
just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

535
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,570
是吗
Really?

536
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,600
没错
Yes, really.

537
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,010
你想在男权社会出人头地 也真是不容易啊
Amazing... what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.

538
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,290
他这话是什么意思
What's he saying that for?

539
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,830
回去干活
Get back to work!

540
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,370
福尔摩斯 说说吧 你肯定有想法了
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?

541
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,850
还没有 这个案子深不可测 华生 深不可测
Not yet. These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.

542
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,780
但我必须深入调查
And I shall have to go deeper still.

543
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,500
"不出几个月之后 我们再次
"It was not for several months that we were to pick up"

544
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,410
被牵扯到这个奇案之中
"The threads of this strange case again."

545
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,620
案情也变得更加出乎意料"
"And then under very unexpected circumstances."

546
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,310
现在已经有五起案子了 全都一模一样
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.

547
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,830
别说话 我在阅读很重要的资料
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.

548
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,420
什么资料
What is?

549
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,820
黄赤交角的问题 我得搞明白才行
The obliquity of the ecliptic. I have to understand it.

550
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,050
那是什么东西
What is it?

551
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,190
我也不知道 我正在努力学呢
I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

552
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,700
我还以为你无所不知呢
I thought you understood everything.

553
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
当然不是了
Of course not, that would be

554
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,660
那多浪费我的大脑空间 我有专攻领域
an appalling waste of brain space. I specialise.

555
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,850
那你为什么学黄赤交角
And what's so important about this?

556
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,600
那我为何要关心 五起无聊的谋杀案
What's so important about five boring murders?

557
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,680
这怎么无聊了 五个男人
They're not boring. Five men dead,

558
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,410
在自己家中被杀 地上撒满大米
murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor

559
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,770
像婚礼现场一样
like at a wedding, and

560
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,500
墙上还用血写着"你"
the word "You" Written in blood on the wall!

561
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,290
就是她 就是那个新娘干的 她不知怎么就复活了
It's, it's her, it's the Bride. Somehow she's risen again.

562
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,540
- 我破案了 - 你怎么可能破案了
- Solved it. - You can't have solved it!

563
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,490
我当然破案了 答案多简单啊
Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.

564
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,870
神秘的瑞克莱蒂夫人杀人案 凶手
The incident of the mysterious Mrs. Ricoletti, the killer from

565
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,270
是来自阴间的鬼魂 从此被媒体大肆渲染
beyond the grave, has been widely reported in the popular press.

566
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,770
刚好凶手可以用鬼魂的传说
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders as the

567
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,310
掩盖自己卑劣的杀人计谋
work of a ghost, to confuse

568
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,950
还能迷惑 愚蠢低能的伦敦警察厅
the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

569
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,570
你看 我破案了
There you are, solved.

570
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,390
你出门的时候 去拜访下哈德森夫人
Pay Mrs. Hudson a visit on your way out,

571
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,620
她喜欢有参与感
she likes to feel involved.

572
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,280
你确定吗
You sure?

573
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,410
当然 你快走吧 华生 我准备好了
Certainly. Go away. Watson! I'm ready.

574
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,240
带上帽子穿好鞋 我们有个重要的约会
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.

575
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,820
华生医生不是几个月之前就搬走了吗
Didn't Dr. Watson move out a few months ago?

576
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,660
对 他搬走了
He did, didn't he?

577
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,610
那我一直都是跟谁说话呢
Who have I been talking to all this time?

578
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,450
请允许我代表
Well, speaking on behalf

579
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,030
愚蠢低能的伦敦警察厅说上一句
of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

580
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,450
那个椅子上一直都没人
that chair is definitely empty.

581
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,610
确实没人 不过刚刚的画面还不错
It is, isn't it? Works surprisingly well, though.

582
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,680
我还以为他能有所进步呢
I actually thought he was improving.

583
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,520
你去哪里了
Ah. Where have you been?

584
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,660
抱歉 先生 我今早起晚了
Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.

585
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,610
你连鸡蛋都不会煮吗
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?!

586
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,230
火也基本没点 到处都是灰尘
The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere

587
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,920
而且你在给靴子清泥的时候 差点把它毁了
and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.

588
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,780
要不是我妻子负责
If it wasn't my wife's business

589
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,730
管理佣人 我早就亲自管教你了
to deal with the staff, I would talk to you myself.

590
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,860
我妻子人呢
Where is my wife?

591
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,140
抱歉 先生 夫人出去了
Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

592
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,270
- 一大早就出门了 - 是的 先生
- Out? At this hour of the morning? - Yes, sir.

593
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,670
您不知道吗 先生
Did you not know that, sir?

594
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,060
她去哪里了 她最近怎么总出门
Where did she go? She's always out these days.

595
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,230
您不也一样 先生
Not unlike yourself... sir.

596
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,850
你说什么
I'm sorry...?

597
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,400
只是我自己的观察 先生
Just observing, sir.

598
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,080
够了 谁让你观察了
Well, that's quite enough, nobody asked you to be observant.

599
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,290
抱歉 先生 我只是注意到
Sorry, sir, I just meant

600
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,440
你们现在很少一起在家 先生
you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.

601
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,940
你现在的言行近乎无礼
You are dangerously close to impertinence.

602
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,940
我会告诉我妻子 让她好好管教你
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.

603
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,480
好的 先生 您什么时候能见到夫人呢
Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?

604
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,230
你听着
Now, listen...

605
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,270
我差点忘了 先生 这有封您的电报
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir. A telegram came for you.

606
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:01,860
你忘了
You forgot?!

607
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,020
- 不是 我差点忘了 - 你这一早上都干什么了
- No, I nearly forgot. - What have you been doing all morning?

608
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,980
读您在"斯特兰报"刊登的新故事 先生
Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.

609
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
你喜欢我的新故事吗
Did you enjoy it?

610
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,020
您为什么没提到我呢 先生
Why do you never mention me, sir?

611
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,600
下去吧
Go away.

612
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,390
- 你说什么 - 我说黄赤交角
- The what of the what? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

613
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,770
你说"速来" 我还以为是很重要的事
"Come at once," You said. I assumed it was important.

614
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,100
是很重要
It is.

615
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,150
黄赤交角就是
It's the inclination of

616
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,060
地球的赤道面 与其绕太阳运行的
the earth's equator to the path of the sun

617
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
轨道平面的夹角
on the celestial plane.

618
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,170
你刚学的吗
You been swotting up?

619
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,680
- 我为什么要学那个 - 为了显得你聪明
- Why would I do that? - To sound clever.

620
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,570
- 我本来就很聪明 - 我明白了
- I am clever. - Oh, oh, I see.

621
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
你明白什么了
You see what?

622
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,650
我推测 我们是要去见一个 比你聪明的人
I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

623
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,720
闭嘴
Shut up.

624
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,000
抱歉 你说什么
Sorry, what?

625
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,860
如果你想研究人类 这里是最合适的地方
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.

626
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,710
对你来说 也很方便
Handy really, as your

627
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,250
毕竟你不断膨胀的屁股 已经永远粘在这里了
ever-expanding backside is permanently glued to it.

628
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,690
- 早上好 哥哥 -夏洛克 华生医生
- Good morning, brother mine. - Sherlock. Dr. Watson.

629
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,500
你看起来 很不错 先生
You look... well, sir.

630
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,950
是吗 我以为自己看起来很臃肿
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.

631
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,870
既然您提到了 这种暴饮暴食的行为
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption

632
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,710
对您健康的危害极大
is incredibly injurious to your health.

633
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,510
您的心脏
Your heart...

634
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,860
- 不必为此担忧 华生 - 没必要吗
- No need to worry on that score, Watson. - No?

635
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,320
他装心脏的地方 本来就是个空腔
There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.

636
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,910
- 这是家族病 - 我没有指责你的意思
- It's a family trait. - Oh, I wasn't being critical.

637
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
如果你继续这样生活
If you continue like this,

638
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,120
先生 我估计您最多能活五年
sir, I give you five years at the most.

639
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,310
- 五年 - 我们以为只有三年呢 是吧 夏洛克
- Five? - We thought three, did we not, Sherlock?

640
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,690
我还是倾向于四年
I'm still inclined to four.

641
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,790
你还是这样 只会看 不懂得观察
As ever, you see but you do not observe.

642
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,370
注意我眼白的颜色发生了变化
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes,

643
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,290
角膜周围出现可见的脂肪圈
the visible rings of fat around the corneas.

644
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,600
没错 你说得有道理
Yes, you're right. I'm changing

645
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,990
那我改成三年四个月零十一天
my bet to three years, four months and 11 days.

646
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,570
敢赌吗
A bet?!

647
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,230
我理解你的不赞同 华生
I understand your disapproval, Watson,

648
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,730
但他好胜心切
but if he's feeling competitive,

649
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,570
完全可以自己控制死亡时间
it's perfectly within his power to die early.

650
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,880
这是必须要承担的风险
That's a risk you'll have to take.

651
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,710
你这是在拿自己的性命打赌
You're gambling with your own life?

652
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,310
为何不呢 这比拿别人性命打赌 有意思多了
Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.

653
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,570
这块葡萄干布丁下肚 我赌你只能活三年
Three years flat, if you eat that plum pudding!

654
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,480
成交
Done.

655
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,280
前几天的庄园一案 我以为会遇见你
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.

656
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,830
我想那案子 你有点力不从心吧
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.

657
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,330
不会 我已经解决了
No. I solved it.

658
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,910
- 肯定是亚当斯 - 对 是亚当斯
- It was Adams, of course. - Yes, it was Adams.

659
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,120
他是因嫉妒而杀人
Murderous jealousy. He'd

660
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,660
他为皇家天文学会写了一篇
written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society

661
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,240
关于黄赤交角的论文
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

662
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,000
然后他又读到一篇 更棒的文章
and then read another that seemed to surpass it.

663
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,320
- 我知道 我看了 - 你看懂了吗
- I know, I read it. - Did you understand it?

664
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,990
我当然能看懂 那文章非常简单
Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.

665
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,700
不 你懂嫉妒杀人吗
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy?

666
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,150
让一个聪明人
It is no easy thing for a

667
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,820
去读懂更聪明人的心思 实属不易啊
great mind to contemplate a still greater one.

668
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,910
所以你叫我来 就是为了羞辱我吗
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?

669
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,360
当然
Yes.

670
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,740
当然不是 但这是我目前最大的乐趣了
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.

671
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,390
你能否解释下叫我来的原因
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon...?

672
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,360
我们的生活正在被 一位无形的敌人威胁着
Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.

673
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,530
这个人每天都在我们身边徘徊
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.

674
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,780
这些敌人无处不在 悄无声息 无人能挡
These enemies are everywhere... undetected... and unstoppable.

675
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,450
他们是社会主义者吗
Socialists?

676
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,780
不是社会主义者 医生
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

677
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,320
- 他们是无政府主义者吗 - 不是
Anarchists? No.

678
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,860
他们是法国人吗 还是妇女参政者
The French? The suffragists?

679
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,740
还有你没有关心到的 大规模人群吗
Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about?

680
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,530
华生医生永远心怀警惕 你详细说明一下
Dr. Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate...

681
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,240
不 你去调查吧
No. Investigate.

682
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,070
这只是我的推测 我需要你去证实它
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.

683
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,650
我把这个案子交给你
I'm sending you a case.

684
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,530
- 他们是苏格兰人吧 - 什么苏格兰人
- The Scots? - The Scots?!

685
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,900
你知道最近有个理论是关于
Are you aware of recent theories concerning what is

686
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,230
妄想症的吗
known as paranoia?

687
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,190
这话听着像是塞尔维亚人
Oh, sounds Serbian.

688
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,860
有个叫卡迈克尔的女人 会去找你
A woman will call on you, Lady Carmichael.

689
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,290
我要你接下她的案子
I want you to take her case.

690
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,360
你如果不告诉我们 这些敌人是谁
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them

691
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,110
我们要如何打败他们
if you won't tell us about them?

692
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,770
我们无法打败他们 我们永远也无法战胜他们
We don't defeat them. We most certainly lose to them.

693
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,550
为什么
Why?

694
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,030
因为他们是对的 而我们是错的
Because they are right. And we are wrong.

695
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,980
卡迈克尔女士那里 是什么案子
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

696
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,860
放心吧 是你会感兴趣的案子
Rest assured, it has features of interest.

697
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,360
- 我从未这么说过 - 你真的说过
I never really say that. You really do.

698
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
我估计你已经解决了吧
And you've solved it already, I assume?

699
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,900
只是想通了而已 我要你帮我跑个腿
Only in my head. I need you for the, er, legwork.

700
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,850
为何不告诉我们 你的推理呢
Why not just tell us your solution?

701
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,560
那还有什么意思呢
And where would be the sport in that?

702
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,980
你愿意接手这个案子吗 夏洛克
Will you do it, Sherlock?

703
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,330
我保证这会是个极好的消遣
I can promise you a superior distraction.

704
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,810
我就一个条件 你再吃个葡萄干布丁吧
On one condition. Have another plum pudding.

705
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,190
我正准备吃呢
There's one on the way.

706
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,810
你只能活两年十一个月零四天了
Two years, 11 months and four days.

707
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,060
开始变得好玩咯 滴答 滴答
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

708
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,020
谢了 威尔德
Thank you, Wilder.

709
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,270
有一位梅拉斯先生要见你 福尔摩斯先生
Also, a Mr. Melas to see you, Mr. Holmes.

710
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,100
等我五分钟 我还有场赌局要赢呢
Ah. Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.

711
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,770
你还是等我十五分钟吧
Better make that 15.

712
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,230
滴答
Ticktock.

713
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,600
福尔摩斯先生 我是来请你出主意的
Mr. Holmes, I have come here for advice.

714
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,850
- 那倒不难 - 还有您的帮助
- That is easily got. - And help.

715
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,890
那就未必容易了
Not always so easy.

716
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,350
福尔摩斯先生 我遇到了一些 不寻常的事情
Something has happened, Mr. Holmes, something... unusual

717
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,900
骇人听闻的事情
and... terrifying.

718
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,760
那你真是太幸运了
Then you are in luck.

719
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,280
幸运吗
Luck?!

720
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,110
那是我的专长 这个案子有点意思
Those are my specialisms. Hmm, this is really very promising.

721
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,350
福尔摩斯
Holmes...

722
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,810
请告诉我们 您在苦恼些什么
Please... do tell us what has so distressed you.

723
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,720
我思前想后很久 不知该怎么办
I... I thought long and hard as to what to do,

724
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,850
后来突然想起 我丈夫与您的哥哥相识
but then it occurred to me that my husband was

725
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,550
所以也许通过他...
an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him...

726
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,730
其实我也不太确定
The fact is, I'm not sure

727
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,760
这事是否在您的管辖范围内 福尔摩斯先生
this comes within your purview, Mr. Holmes.

728
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,010
是吗
No?

729
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,010
上帝啊 也许我该找个驱魔师
Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.

730
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,470
你早晨受到什么惊吓了 亲爱的
And what does your morning threaten, my dear?

731
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,360
刺绣做地停不下来吗
A vigorous round of embroidering?

732
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,610
还是跟女帽商们见面太频繁了
An exhausting appointment at the milliners?

733
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,550
你就喜欢取笑我 尤斯塔斯
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

734
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,240
怎么了
What is it?

735
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,190
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

736
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,420
丹尼尔 苏菲 你们去外面玩会
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

737
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,710
但是 妈妈
But, Mama...

738
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,560
听话 快去吧
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

739
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,460
尤斯塔斯 这是什么东西
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

740
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
死亡
Death.

741
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,130
什么
What?

742
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,020
这意味着死亡
It means death.

743
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,040
没什么 没什么
Er, nothing, it's, er, it's nothing.

744
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,290
我弄错了
I was... mistaken.

745
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,250
亲爱的 你脸色好苍白
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

746
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,030
我没事
It's nothing!

747
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,790
- 尤斯塔斯 - 信封你还留着吗
- Eustace... - 'Did you keep the envelope?'

748
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,460
我丈夫销毁了 但上面什么都没有
My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.

749
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,710
没有姓名 没有地址
No name or address of any kind.

750
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,420
尤斯塔斯先生有在美国待过吗
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?

751
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,880
- 没有 - 你们结婚之前 也没有吗
- No. - Not even before your marriage?

752
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,830
- 据我所知没有 - 好吧
- Well, not to my knowledge. - Hmm.

753
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,170
请您接着讲 这个令人着迷的故事吧
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.

754
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,830
那件事 发生在上周一的清晨
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.

755
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,410
两天后 也就是周三
It was two days later on

756
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,710
我丈夫第一次看见了她
the Wednesday that my husband first saw her.

757
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,990
看见了谁
Who?

758
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,750
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

759
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,450
她来找我了 路易莎
She's come for me, Louisa!

760
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,500
天啊 帮帮我 我的罪孽找到我了
Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out!

761
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,280
谁来找你了 尤斯塔斯 你吓到我了
Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.

762
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,270
看啊 看啊
Well, look, look!

763
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,240
你没看见她吗
Don't you see her?

764
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,350
我什么也没看见
No, I see no-one.

765
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,330
她走了
Gone.

766
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,580
这又是一个 你瞒着我的秘密吗
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another?

767
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
你看见了谁
Who have you seen?

768
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,610
是她
It was her!

769
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,370
那个鬼新娘
It was the Bride!

770
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,200
但你什么也没看见吗
And you saw nothing?

771
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,490
是的
Nothing.

772
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,270
- 你丈夫有描述过... - 没有 直到今天早晨
- Did your husband describe...? - Nothing, until this morning.

773
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,300
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

774
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,330
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

775
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,470
尤斯塔斯 是你吗
Eustace?

776
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,240
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

777
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,730
该死的
Blast!

778
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,360
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

779
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,030
你去哪里了 是我啊
Where are you? It's me!

780
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,610
# 勿忘我 #
Do not forget me

781
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,280
# 勿忘我 #
Do not forget me

782
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,070
# 还记得那少女吗 #
Remember the maid

783
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,690
# 那个磨坊少女 #
The maid of the mill...

784
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,730
你是谁
Who are you?

785
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,070
我命令你 报上名来
I demand you speak, who are you?!

786
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,450
尤斯塔斯 说句话啊 天啊
Eustace, speak to me. In the name of God!

787
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,870
她是...
She's...

788
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,010
她是艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

789
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,450
不 不可能是你
No, not you.

790
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,390
不要
No...

791
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,270
求你了
Please!

792
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:08,980
今晚 尤斯塔斯·卡迈克尔 你必死无疑
This night, Eustace Carmichael, you will die!

793
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,550
- 福尔摩斯 - 别出声 华生
- Holmes? - Hush, Watson.

794
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,390
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂 那个新娘
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

795
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,010
- 你知道她的名字吗 - 请原谅华生
- Well, you know the name? - You must forgive Watson,

796
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,290
他就热衷于说一些
he has an enthusiasm for

797
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,640
显而易见的事实 他就喜欢这样
stating the obvious, which borders on mania.

798
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,640
请问 您丈夫今早还好吗
May I ask, how is your husband this morning?

799
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,010
他拒绝谈论此事
He refuses to speak about the matter.

800
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,990
显然 我已催促 让他离开家
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.

801
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,760
不行 他必须得待在家里
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

802
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,590
您不觉得 他正处于危险之中吗
Well, you don't think he's in danger?

803
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,510
当然 的确是有人
Oh, no, somebody definitely

804
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,940
想害他性命 但对我们来说是件好事
wants to kill him, but that's good for us.

805
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,800
要设陷阱 还需先有诱饵
You can't set a trap without bait.

806
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,980
我丈夫可不是诱饵 福尔摩斯先生
My husband is not bait, Mr. Holmes.

807
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,610
如果我们确保万无一失 就没有关系
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

808
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,380
听着 你现在立刻回家
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.

809
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,510
华生医生和我会乘坐下一班火车过去
Dr. Watson and I will follow on the next train.

810
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,570
一刻也不能耽搁 尤斯塔斯爵士今夜会死
There's not a moment to lose, Sir Eustace is to die tonight.

811
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,160
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

812
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,010
我们也许能避免此事
And we should... probably avoid that.

813
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,220
- 是一定 - 一定会避免此事
- Definitely. - Definitely avoid that.

814
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,050
当然 我弟弟接下了这件案子
Little brother has taken the case, of course.

815
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,630
那就拜托你 帮我多留心此事了
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things,

816
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,300
但绝不能让他怀疑 你在为我办事
but he must never suspect you are working for me.

817
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,380
听清楚了吗 华生
Are you clear on that, Watson?

818
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,090
请相信我 福尔摩斯先生
You can rely on me, Mr. Holmes.

819
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,250
- 你说会不会 - 不会 你也不该有这种想法
You don't suppose... - I don't and neither should you.

820
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,960
你又不知道我打算说什么
You don't know what I was going to say.

821
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,970
你是想说 可能有什么超自然的力量
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency

822
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,730
牵扯其中 而我正准备当面嘲笑你
involved in this matter. And I was about to laugh in your face.

823
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,880
但那个新娘 艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂再次出现了
But the Bride, Holmes, Emelia Ricoletti again.

824
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,410
一名死去的女子又重现人间
A dead woman walking the earth.

825
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,310
- 你真让我惊讶啊 华生 - 是吗
- You amaze me, Watson. - I do?

826
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,940
你什么时候开始 居然这么有想象力了
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?

827
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,230
估计自从我让读者们相信
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that

828
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,970
道德败坏的瘾君子
an unprincipled drug addict

829
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,150
也能是风度翩翩的英雄人物吧
was some kind of gentleman hero.

830
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,350
是啊 提到这事 你还真是了不起啊
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.

831
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,230
你放心 这个世界上没有鬼
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.

832
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,310
鬼怪只来自我们心中
Save those we make for ourselves.

833
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,390
抱歉 你这话是什么意思
Sorry, what did you say?

834
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,650
我们想象出的鬼 这是什么意思
Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean?

835
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,720
我有梦游症
Somnambulism.

836
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,550
您说什么
I beg your pardon?

837
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,110
我会梦游 就这样 不是什么大事
I sleepwalk, that's all. It's a common enough condition.

838
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,940
您不就是医生吗
I thought you were a doctor!

839
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,190
整件事就是一场恶梦
The whole thing was a... bad dream.

840
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,870
包括您收到的 信封里的东西吗
Including the contents of the envelope you received?

841
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,210
那只是个奇怪的玩笑
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

842
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:58,230
您妻子感觉并非如此啊 先生
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.

843
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,650
- 她有臆想病 很容易幻想 - 并非如此
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies. - No.

844
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,900
-很抱歉 您说什么 - 我说不对 她并没有臆想病
- I'm sorry, what did you say? - I said no, she's not an hysteric.

845
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,790
她是个有着罕见洞察力的聪明女人
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.

846
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,350
我的妻子从橙核里看出了恐惧
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.

847
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,600
你的妻子能在别人认为毫无价值的地方
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see

848
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,350
看出很多东西
anything of value whatsoever.

849
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,640
真的吗
Can she really?

850
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,850
那您是如何"推理"出来的呢 福尔摩斯先生
And how do you "Deduce" That, Mr. Holmes?

851
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,350
她嫁给了你
She married you.

852
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,390
我想她一定有合理的理由
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.

853
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,060
今晚我会竭尽全力护你周全 但首先
I'll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would

854
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,270
如果您能解释与瑞克莱蒂一案的关系
help if you would explain your connection.

855
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,140
我想定会大有帮助
to the Ricoletti case.

856
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,810
瑞克莱蒂
Ricoletti?

857
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,390
是的 请详情说来
Yes. In detail, please.

858
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,140
我从未听说过她
I've never heard of her.

859
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,560
有意思 我并没有提到 她是个女人
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman.

860
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,770
我们先告辞了 希望明早还能再见到你
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.

861
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,040
我们不会再见面了
You will not.

862
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,080
那可真是不幸 那我就得来破你的谋杀案了 再会
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.

863
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,460
你尽力了
Well, you tried.

864
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,180
请转交给卡迈克尔夫人 谢谢
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this. Thank you.

865
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,610
- 午安 - 没问题 先生
- Good afternoon. - Certainly, sir.

866
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
那是什么
What was that?

867
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,040
卡迈克尔夫人今晚
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight,

868
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,950
会假装头痛难忍 而独自就寝
upon the pretence of a violent headache.

869
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,500
所有的门窗都会上锁
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.

870
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,500
你觉得那幽灵 那鬼新娘
Ha! You think the spectre, er, Bride,

871
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,120
会再次试图将尤斯塔斯爵士 引到外面去吗
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?

872
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,540
当然 不然她为何口出狂言
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat?

873
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,790
- "今晚你必死无疑" - 他不会跟出去的吧
- "This night you will die!" - Well, he won't follow her, surely?

874
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,580
他会怎么做 还真的很难说
Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.

875
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,450
- 愧疚在吞噬他的灵魂 - 愧疚 什么愧疚
- Guilt is eating away at his soul. - Guilt? About what?

876
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,950
他的过去 那些橙核是个提醒
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.

877
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,070
- 不是玩笑吗 - 完全不是
- Not a joke? - Not at all.

878
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,510
有一个传统是用橙核
Orange pips are a traditional

879
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,890
来预警复仇偿命的 这个起源于美国
warning of avenging death, originating in America.

880
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,490
尤斯塔斯爵士对此再了解不过了
Sir Eustace knows this only too well,

881
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,870
他很清楚自己 为何要受惩罚
just as he knows why he is to be punished.

882
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,080
是和艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂有关吗
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti?

883
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,910
我想是的 我们都有过去 华生 而鬼魂
I presume. We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

884
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,320
他们如同阴霾 正是因为有了阴霾 才会出现阳光
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

885
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,240
尤斯塔斯爵士知道自己是逃不过了
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

886
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,160
他恐惧的不仅仅是死亡
There's something more than murder he fears.

887
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,530
他深信死去的瑞克莱蒂太太复活的尸体
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse

888
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,120
会将他拖入万丈深渊
of the late Mrs. Ricoletti.

889
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,260
那也太荒谬了吧
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

890
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,010
老天 当然荒谬了 你的左轮手枪带了吗
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?

891
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,370
用手枪对付幽灵有用吗
What good would that be against a ghost?

892
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,140
- 那当然 你带了吗 - 嗯 带了
- Exactly. Did you bring it? - Yeah, of course.

893
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,250
那就来吧 华生 来吧 游戏开始了
Then come, Watson, come. The game is afoot.

894
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,430
- 蹲下来 华生 老天啊 - 抱歉 我抽筋了
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake! - Sorry. Cramp.

895
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,450
- 灯还亮着吗 - 是的
- Is the lamp still burning? - Yes.

896
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,300
尤斯塔斯爵士的灯灭了
There goes Sir Eustace.

897
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,730
卡迈克尔夫人的灯也灭了
And Lady Carmichael.

898
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,970
整栋房子都入睡了
The house sleeps.

899
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,600
天啊 这是我这一生之中 最漫长的一夜了
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.

900
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,390
耐心点 华生
Have patience, Watson.

901
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,930
就到午夜而已
Only midnight.

902
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,560
我们很少像现在这样坐在一起
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.

903
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,310
我觉得也是 但现在谋杀案迫在眉睫
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.

904
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,680
两个老朋友说说话 聊聊天
Two old friends just talking. Chewing the fat.

905
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,450
男人和男人之间的对话
Man-to-man.

906
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,550
那个不同寻常的女人
So, a remarkable woman.

907
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,800
- 谁 - 卡迈克尔夫人
- Who? - Lady Carmichael.

908
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,520
女性方面可是你的专长 华生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

909
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,760
我接受你的评价
I'll take your word for it.

910
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,280
你挺喜欢她的 "那个女人有罕见的洞察力"
Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

911
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,990
和令人赞叹的高足弓
And admirably high arches.

912
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,260
她一踏进房间我就注意到了
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.

913
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,550
- 他根本配不上她 - 你这么认为吗
- Huh, she's far too good for him. - You think so?

914
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,180
不 是你这么认为 我能看出来
No. You think so. I could tell.

915
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,940
相反 我对此事一点都不在意
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.

916
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,670
你就是在意
Yes, you have.

917
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,550
- 婚姻不是我会想的东西 - 为什么
- Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell. - Oh, why not?

918
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,660
你今晚是怎么了
What's the matter with you this evening?

919
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,910
你戴着的那个怀表 里面有一张照片
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.

920
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,680
我有一次瞥见了 我想那是艾琳·艾德勒的照片
I glimpsed it once. I believe it is of Irene Adler.

921
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,860
你才不是瞥见的 你是等我睡着之后
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep

922
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,280
- 自己偷看的 - 是的
- and looked at it. - Yes, I did.

923
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,670
- 你真以为我没注意到吗 - 艾琳·艾德勒
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice? - Irene Adler.

924
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,090
一个强大的对手 一次难忘的冒险经历
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.

925
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,530
- 那照片很好看 - 你说这些干什么
- A very nice photograph. - Why are you talking like this?

926
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,200
你为何立志要孤身一人
Why are you so determined to be alone?

927
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,100
你还好吧 华生
Are you quite well, Watson?

928
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,340
这是个奇怪的问题吗
Is it such a curious question?

929
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,400
对一个维也纳的精神病医生来说 不是
From a Viennese alienist, no.

930
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,520
但对一个退役军医来说 当然是
From a retired Army surgeon, most certainly.

931
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,100
福尔摩斯 我绝非是你的对手
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever,

932
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,570
- 我是你最亲近的朋友 - 我承认
- I am your closest friend. - I concede it.

933
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,320
我现在只是尝试跟你进行一段
I am currently attempting to have

934
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,610
非常正常的对话而已
a perfectly normal conversation with you.

935
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,120
- 求你别了 - 你为什么非得一个人呢
- Please don't. - Why do you need to be alone?

936
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,110
如果你说的是 关于情感纠葛的事 华生
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson,

937
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,420
恐怕你说的就是这个 就像我以前经常解释的那样
which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before,

938
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,540
我讨厌所有的情感
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

939
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,400
情感是精密仪器上的沙粒
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.

940
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,560
- 镜头上的裂缝 - 镜头上的裂缝 是的
- The crack in the lens. - The crack in the lens. Yes.

941
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,840
明白了吧 我之前告诉过你
Well, there you are, you see, I've said it all before.

942
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,090
不 这些都是我写的
No, I wrote all that.

943
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,240
你在引用"斯特兰德杂志"里自己的话
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.

944
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,700
- 正是 - 那是我写的 不是你说的
- Well, exactly. - Those are my words, not yours!

945
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,030
那是我向公众呈现的 你的样子
That is the version of you that I present to the public.

946
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,240
没有情感的头脑 就像一台计算机
The brain without a heart. The calculating machine.

947
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,750
那些都是我写的 福尔摩斯 读者也欣然接受了
I write all of that, Holmes, and the readers lap it up.

948
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,000
但我并不相信这个事实
But I do not believe it.

949
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,550
我想给你的编辑写信
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.

950
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,200
你是一个活生生的人
You are a living, breathing man.

951
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,740
- 你有自己的生活 也有过去 - 有什么
- You've lived a life, you have a past. - A what?!

952
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,110
- 你肯定有过... - 有过什么
- Well, you must have had... - Had what?

953
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,330
- 你知道的 - 不知道
- You know. - No.

954
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,450
经历
Experiences.

955
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,110
把你的左轮手枪给我 我突然想用一下
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.

956
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,170
可恶 福尔摩斯 你是血肉之躯
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood,

957
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,670
你有感觉 你有...
you have feelings, you have...

958
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,920
你肯定会有 冲动
You must have... impulses.

959
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,380
我的天啊 我从来没有像这样
Dear Lord, I have never been

960
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,830
想马上被杀人厉鬼袭击的感觉
so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost.

961
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,370
作为你的朋友 作为一个担心你的人
As your friend, as someone who worries about you...

962
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,010
是什么事情 造就了你性格
What made you like this?

963
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,100
华生
Oh, Watson...

964
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,490
无事造就了我
Nothing made me.

965
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,540
我造就了自己
I made me.

966
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,450
红胡子
Redbeard?

967
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,410
我的天啊
Good God!

968
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,030
我们该怎么办
What are we to do?

969
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,870
我们去跟她聊会天吧
Why don't we have a chat?

970
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,900
我想你是瑞克莱蒂夫人吧
Mrs. Ricoletti, I believe!

971
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,520
每年的今晚 真是宜人 对吧
A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?

972
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,900
这不可能是真的 福尔摩斯 这不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

973
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,310
对 不可能
No, it can't.

974
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,150
- 门锁上了吗 - 按要求锁着呢
- Is it locked? - As per instruction.

975
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,150
那是打破窗户的声音吗
That was a window breaking, wasn't it?

976
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,630
我们只用担心 一扇打破的窗户就行了
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.

977
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,070
- 待在这里 华生 - 什么 我不要
- Stay here, Watson. - What? No.

978
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,490
房子里所有的窗户 和门都上了锁
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.

979
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,570
这是他们唯一的出口 我需要你在这守着
This is their only way out, I need you here!

980
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,470
但那个声音那么近
But the sound was so close.

981
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,800
肯定是从房子这边传来的
It had to be from this side of the house.

982
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,820
待在这里
Stay here!

983
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,320
不
No!

984
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,280
你保证会护他安全 你保证过的
You promised to keep him safe. You promised!

985
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,640
你
You...

986
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,520
你是人 我知道
You're human, I know that.

987
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,090
你肯定是人
You must be.

988
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,560
我们站在黑暗中也没用
Little use us standing here in the dark.

989
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,930
毕竟 这是十九世纪了
After all, this is the 19th century.

990
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:58,050
勿忘我
Do not forget me!

991
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,880
勿忘我
Do not forget me!

992
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,610
华生
Watson!

993
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,880
她在那里 她就在那里
She's there! She's down there!

994
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,550
别告诉我 你擅离职守了
Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

995
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,450
什么 福尔摩斯 她就在那里 我看见她了
What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her!

996
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,910
没人 这都得感谢你
Empty, thanks to you!

997
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,360
我们的目标跑了
Our bird is flown!

998
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,250
不 福尔摩斯 不是你想的那样
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.

999
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,670
我看见她了 那个鬼魂
I saw her! The ghost!

1000
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,050
世界上 没有 鬼魂
There are no ghosts!

1001
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,860
那发生什么事了 尤斯塔斯先生在哪里
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

1002
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,630
他死了
Dead.

1003
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,110
你不需要责怪自己
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.

1004
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,490
- 你说得对 - 很高兴你终于明事理了
- No, you're quite right. - I'm glad you're seeing sense.

1005
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,920
华生也该受罚
Watson is equally culpable.

1006
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,420
我们已经设法 搞砸了整个案子
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.

1007
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,420
我承诺过要保护那个男人
I gave an undertaking to protect that man,

1008
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,710
但他现在躺在那里 胸口上还插着把匕首
now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.

1009
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,660
事实上 你只是承诺过 要调查他的谋杀案
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.

1010
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,110
因为我非常相信 他一定不会死
In the confident expectation I would not have to!

1011
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,320
你发现什么了吗 医生
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

1012
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,710
捅他的人力气可不小
Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.

1013
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,960
- 凶手是个男人吗 - 有可能
- It's a man, then? - Possibly.

1014
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,910
刀刃非常锋利 所以也有可能是个女人吧
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman?

1015
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,620
理论上来说 是的 但我们知道是谁 我看见她了
In theory, yes, but we know who it was, I saw her.

1016
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,060
- 华生 - 我亲眼看见那个鬼魂了
- Watson! - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

1017
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,770
你看到的都是假象
You saw nothing!

1018
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,160
是他们想要你 看见那个鬼魂
You saw what you were supposed to see!

1019
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
你自己也说过 我没有想象力
You said yourself, I have no imagination.

1020
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,970
那你就动脑啊 尽管没什么用
Then use your brain, such as it is,

1021
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,220
至少能排除掉不可能的因素
to eliminate the impossible,

1022
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,480
在这桩案件中 鬼魂就是不可能因素
which in this case is the ghost,

1023
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,840
然后再观察其它的线索
and observe what remains,

1024
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,200
这桩案子的谜底
which in this case is a solution

1025
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,410
已经明显到 连莱斯特雷德都能看出来了
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!

1026
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,490
谢谢夸奖
Thank you!

1027
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,910
别去想另一个世界的幽灵了
Forget spectres from the other world!

1028
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,660
只有一个嫌疑人有动机 也有机会
There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.

1029
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,160
- 他们可能又留了字条 - 他们确实留了字条
- They might as well have left a note. - They did leave a note.

1030
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,620
还有另一扇破窗户的问题
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.

1031
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,080
- 什么另一扇破窗户 - 正是 没有另一扇
- What other broken window? - Precisely! There isn't one.

1032
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,340
唯一被打破的窗户
The only broken window is

1033
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,450
就是我和华生进来的那扇
the one that Watson and I entered through,

1034
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,360
但在那之前 我们清晰地听到了声音
yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...

1035
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,800
- 你刚说了什么 - 什么
- What did you just say? - Sorry?

1036
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,760
关于字条的事 你刚说了什么
About a note, what did you just say?

1037
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,580
- 我说凶手确实留了张字条 - 不 他们没留
- I said the murderer DID leave a note. - No, they didn't.

1038
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,530
匕首上绑了一张字条 你看定看见了
There's a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!

1039
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,280
- 根本没有字条 - 有的
- There's no message. - Yes!

1040
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,780
我发现尸体的时候 根本没有字条
There was no message when I found the body.

1041
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,620
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1042
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,740
上面写了什么
What is it?

1043
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,070
你想吗
Do you?

1044
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,490
想什么
Do I what?

1045
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,990
你怎么拿到这个的
H... how did you get that?

1046
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,690
我把它留在犯罪现场了
I left it at the crime scene.

1047
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,050
"犯罪现场" 你从哪里
"Crime scene"? Where do

1048
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,650
学来的这些 奇怪的表达方式
you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1049
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,440
你想他吗
Do you miss him?

1050
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,900
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty is dead.

1051
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,360
但是呢
And yet...?

1052
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,480
没有人找到他的尸体
His body was never recovered.

1053
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,060
你推下的可是一位数学教授
To be expected when one

1054
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,940
这种结果也在预料之中
pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.

1055
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,940
纯粹的理性被情节剧推翻了
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.

1056
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,650
一句话概括你的人生
Your life in a nutshell.

1057
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,280
你又从哪里学来 这些奇怪的表达方式
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1058
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,710
你又胖了吗
Have you put on weight?

1059
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,230
你昨天刚见过我 你觉得可能吗
You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?

1060
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,520
- 不可能 - 但我确实胖了
- No. - Yet here I am, increased.

1061
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,970
整个英格兰
What does that tell the

1062
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,610
最著名的犯罪调查人员 从中看出什么了
foremost criminal investigator in England?

1063
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,560
整个英格兰
In England?

1064
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,060
你陷得很深 夏洛克 比你想象中还要深
You're in deep, Sherlock, deeper than you ever intended to be.

1065
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,400
- 你列了清单吗 - 什么清单
- Have you made a list? - Of what?

1066
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,310
所有的事情 我们会需要一张清单
Everything. We will need a list.

1067
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,850
好孩子
Good boy.

1068
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,850
不 我还没有完成清单
No, I haven't finished yet.

1069
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,020
莫里亚蒂恕不同意
Moriarty may beg to differ.

1070
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,100
他想要我分心 要我脱离正轨
He's trying to distract me. To derail me.

1071
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,680
是的
Yes.

1072
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,100
他是镜头上的裂缝 软膏里的苍蝇
He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment,

1073
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,890
数据中的病毒
the virus in the data.

1074
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,310
我必须了结这一切
I have to finish this.

1075
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,850
如果莫里亚蒂真的 从赖兴巴赫瀑布下 起死回生了
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron,

1076
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,440
他会来找你的
he will seek you out.

1077
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,830
那我就等着他了
I'll be waiting.

1078
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,560
是啊
Yes.

1079
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,100
恐怕你会等到他的
I'm very much afraid you will.

1080
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,260
他已经那个样子两天了
Two days he's been like that.

1081
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,040
- 他吃东西了吗 - 一口都没吃
- Has he eaten? - No, not a morsel.

1082
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,000
媒体的大好机会来了
Press are having a ruddy field day.

1083
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,130
到现在还有记者在外面等着
There's still reporters outside.

1084
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,590
他们一直都在那里 我没法摆脱他们
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.

1085
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,890
我一直都在忙着给他们泡茶呢
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.

1086
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,720
你为什么要给他们泡茶
Why do you make them tea?

1087
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,470
我不知道 我就是这样做了
I dunno, I just sort of do.

1088
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,210
他说了 "只有一个嫌疑人" 然后就离开了
He said, "There's only one suspect," And then he just walks away

1089
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,500
现在他又不做推理
and now he won't explain.

1090
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,750
真奇怪 他向来很喜欢推理的
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.

1091
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,460
他还说这案子简单到 我都能解决了
Said it was so simple I could solve it.

1092
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,250
他肯定只是夸张而已
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

1093
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,710
你觉得他这是在干什么呢
What's he doing, do you think?

1094
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,290
- 他说他在等 - 等什么
- He says he's waiting. - For what?

1095
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:31,080
等恶魔 我不觉得这有什么奇怪
The devil. I wouldn't be surprised.

1096
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,960
什么样的人都来过这里
We get all sorts here.

1097
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,330
- 有消息就给我发电报 - 好
- Well, wire me if there's any change. - Yeah.

1098
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:25,000
我要说的话 你都已经知道了吧
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

1099
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,910
那我的答案 你也都知道了吧
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.

1100
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,100
像子弹般穿过
Like a bullet.

1101
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,530
手拿睡袍里
It's a dangerous habit,

1102
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:43,160
上了膛的手枪 可是个危险的习惯
to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

1103
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,070
还是说你很高兴看到我
Or are you just pleased to see me?

1104
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,010
你一定不会介意 我做些预防措施
You'll forgive me for taking precautions.

1105
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,320
如果你没做防御措施 我才介意呢
I'd be offended if you didn't.

1106
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,160
很显然 我也礼尚往来了
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.

1107
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,660
我喜欢你的房间 闻起来非常得
I like your rooms. They smell so...

1108
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,170
有男子气概
manly.

1109
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,900
你肯定在此之前就来过这里了
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.

1110
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,500
你总是不在家
Well, you are always away,

1111
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,030
总在为"斯特兰德杂志"出去冒险
on your little adventures for The Strand.

1112
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,950
告诉我 插画师也跟你一起出去旅行吗
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you?

1113
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:29,580
你推理的时候 还要摆姿势吗
Do you have to pose... during your deductions?

1114
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,530
我不在的时候 你来过我公寓六次了
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments

1115
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,400
- 我都注意到了 - 我知道
- during my absence. - I know you are.

1116
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,170
顺便说一句 你的床真是很舒服啊
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.

1117
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,480
你知道灰尘大部分 是人体皮屑组成的吗
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin?

1118
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,490
我知道
Yes.

1119
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,490
不过尝起来不太一样 人的皮肤还是更新鲜些
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.

1120
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,120
- 这个有点太脆了 - 你不坐下吗
- Just a little crispy. - Won't you sit down?

1121
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,490
人就是这样 你知道吧
That's all people really are, you know,

1122
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,280
都是随风飘散的灰尘
dust waiting to be distributed.

1123
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,070
而且飘得到处都是
And it gets everywhere. Ugh.

1124
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,030
存在于每一口呼吸里 在每一缕阳光里起舞的
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam,

1125
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,450
都是精疲力竭的人啊
all the used-up people.

1126
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,560
真有意思 你还是坐下...
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit...

1127
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,040
人啊 无法保持一尘不染
People, people, people! Can't keep anything shiny.

1128
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,910
你介意我开枪吗
Do you mind if I fire this?

1129
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,690
就清理一下灰尘而已
Just to clean it out.

1130
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,480
就是这样 还是别玩了
Exactly, let's stop playing.

1131
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,350
我们不需要用玩具来杀掉对方
We don't need toys to kill each other.

1132
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,790
- 那样就不亲密了 - 坐下
- Where's the intimacy in that? - Sit down.

1133
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,080
- 为什么 你想知道什么 - 是你选择过来的
- Why? What do you want? - You chose to come here.

1134
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,940
不对 你知道这个答案是错误的
Not true, you know that's not true.

1135
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,220
你想知道什么 夏洛克
What do you want, Sherlock?

1136
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,270
真相
The truth.

1137
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,050
那个啊 真相很无聊的
That. Truth's boring!

1138
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,740
你没想到我会
You didn't expect me to

1139
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,130
出现在犯罪现场 对吧
turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?

1140
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,760
可怜的尤斯塔斯先生 他罪有应得
Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him.

1141
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,480
但不可能是你杀了他
But you couldn't have killed him.

1142
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,190
那又怎么样 这很重要吗 真是够了
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it. Stop this.

1143
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,440
你根本不在乎尤斯塔斯先生
You don't care about Sir Eustace,

1144
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,020
或是那个新娘 或是其他东西
or the Bride, or any of it.

1145
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,340
这整个案件中只有一件事
There's only one thing in

1146
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,770
你觉得有意思
this whole business that you find interesting.

1147
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,310
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

1148
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,260
新娘把枪放进了嘴里
The Bride put a gun in

1149
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,860
把自己后脑勺都打开花了
her mouth and shot the back of her head off

1150
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,260
但她却又起死回生了
and then she came back.

1151
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,680
不可能的事 但她做到了
Impossible. But she did it.

1152
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,480
你想知道她是怎么做到的
And you need to know how.

1153
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,600
这究竟是怎么回事
How?

1154
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,650
是不是
Don't you?

1155
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,320
因为这个谜团 你的世界都要分崩离析了
It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.

1156
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,240
你是想阻止我 让我分心 让我脱离正轨
You're trying to stop me... To distract me, derail me.

1157
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,410
因为这让你想起了另一个案子吧
Because doesn't this remind you of another case?

1158
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,970
这一切以前都发生过吧
Hasn't this all happened before?

1159
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,580
天下原无新鲜事 以前发生过什么事情
There's nothing new under the sun. What was it?

1160
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,720
是什么事情 是什么案子
What was it? What was that case? Huh?

1161
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,260
你记得吗
Do you remember?

1162
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,670
就在我嘴边了 我要说出来了
It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the tip of my tongue.

1163
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,380
我马上就要说出来了
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1164
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,980
就在
It's on the tip...

1165
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,500
我舌头上了
of my tongue.

1166
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,490
为了哈德森夫人的墙纸着想 我得提醒你
For the sake of Mrs. Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you

1167
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,330
你的手指乱动一下 你就会死
that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.

1168
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,450
你说什么
I'm sorry?

1169
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,640
死亡 是新的性感体验
Dead... is the new sexy.

1170
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,870
这一枪把我彻底打醒了
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1171
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,550
- 你怎么可能还活着 - 我看起来怎么样
- How can you be alive? - How do I look?

1172
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,830
你跟我说实话 这很显眼是吧
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1173
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,200
你打穿了自己的大脑 怎么可能还活着
You blew your own brains out, how could you survive?

1174
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,660
我梳个背头 应该能挡住
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1175
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,990
我亲眼看到你死了
I saw you die.

1176
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,970
你为什么还没死
Why aren't you dead?

1177
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,200
因为不是瀑布害死了你 夏洛克
Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.

1178
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,640
你比所有人都清楚 不是瀑布
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall,

1179
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,730
瀑布不会害死你
it's never the fall.

1180
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,490
你是在降落了
It's the landing!

1181
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,660
我们着陆了 先生 我们已经着陆了
We've landed, sir. We've landed.

1182
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,650
别 别现在叫醒我
No, no, not now, not now!

1183
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,680
别现在醒来啊
Not now, not now.

1184
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,510
我相信您 度过了个愉快的航程 先生
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir?

1185
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,790
这流放比我们想得还要短 我的弟弟
Well, a somewhat shorter exile than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1186
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,140
不过你作为重度强迫症患者 大概也足够长了
but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.

1187
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,390
- 我得回去 - 什么
- I have to go back! - What?

1188
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,340
我 我就快明白了 我马上就知道了
I was... I was nearly there, I nearly had it!

1189
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,010
你到底在说什么东西
What on earth are you talking about?

1190
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,120
回哪里去 你没飞多远啊
Go back where? You didn't get very far.

1191
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,020
瑞克莱蒂和他可恶的妻子 你们懂了吗
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?!

1192
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,280
不 我们当然不懂 你在说胡话呢 夏洛克
No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.

1193
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:13,840
那是一个一百年前的名案
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.

1194
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,000
存在我的硬盘里
Lodged in my hard drive,

1195
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,220
她本应该死了 却又死而复生
she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.

1196
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,390
什么 像莫里亚蒂一样吗
What, like Moriarty?

1197
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,360
朝着头开了一枪 跟莫里亚蒂一模一样
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1198
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,750
但是你才刚刚知道
But you've only just been told.

1199
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,020
我们也是刚刚才知道
We've only just found out,

1200
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,890
他出现在了全国所有的电视屏幕上
he's on every TV screen in the country.

1201
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,860
所以呢 迈克罗夫特的电话 都已经打来五分钟了
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.

1202
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,050
你们有什么进展 你们做了什么事情
What progress have you made? What have you been doing?

1203
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,960
更重要的是 你又做了什么事情
More to the point, what have YOU been doing?

1204
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,340
我当然一直在思维殿堂里
I've been in my Mind Palace, of course.

1205
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:33,680
当然了
Of course.

1206
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,560
做一个实验 如果我在1895年的现场
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime,

1207
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:39,760
- 我会怎么破这个案 - 夏洛克
- if I'd been there in 1895? - Oh, Sherlock.

1208
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,220
我掌握了所有的细节
I had all the details perfect.

1209
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,510
我就在现场 万事俱备 我正沉浸其中
I was there, all of it, everything. I was immersed.

1210
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,760
是啊 正是如此
Of course you were.

1211
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,440
你一直在读约翰的博客 你们相遇的故事
You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.

1212
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,840
有些时候通过他的视角 审视自己很有帮助
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.

1213
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,220
我比他聪明多了
I'm so much cleverer.

1214
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,300
你觉得有谁 会相信你的话吗
Do you really think anyone is believing you?

1215
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,720
不 他能做到 我见过的
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1216
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,010
思维殿堂 好像全世界都在他的脑中
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.

1217
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,050
是啊 我需要回到那里
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1218
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:05,930
思维殿堂是一种记忆技巧 我知道它能做什么事情
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do

1219
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,800
我也知道它绝不能做什么事情
and I know what it most certainly cannot.

1220
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,780
也许有一两件事 是我知道 而你却不知道的
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.

1221
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,990
确实有 你列清单了吗
Oh, there are. Did you make a list?

1222
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,490
你胖了
You've put on weight.

1223
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,450
你穿的西装背心 明显要比夹克新
That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.

1224
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,750
够了 你列清单了吗
Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?!

1225
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,110
什么清单
Of what?

1226
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,400
夏洛克 你摄入的所有东西
Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.

1227
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,450
不 他没有嗑药 嗑药后
No, it's not that, he goes

1228
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,200
他会进入一种恍惚状态 我见过他那样
into a sort of trance. I've seen him do it.

1229
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,500
从那一天起 我和我弟弟 就做了一个约定
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.

1230
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,520
不管我在哪里找到他
Wherever I find him,

1231
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,130
无论是小胡同 还是廉价旅馆
whatever back alley or doss-house...

1232
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,090
他都要给我列一个清单
there will always be a list.

1233
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,370
他不可能在五分钟内 吸食这么多毒品
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.

1234
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,680
他上飞机前 就已经嗑高了
He was high before he got on the plane.

1235
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,040
他当时看上去可不像
He didn't seem high.

1236
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,540
瘾君子最擅长伪装骗人了
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1237
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,960
我不是瘾君子 我只是在利用毒品
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1238
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,330
我这样来排解无聊
I alleviate boredom and

1239
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,880
偶尔也用来加快思维进程
occasionally heighten my thought processes.

1240
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,540
老天爷啊 这可是致命的
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1241
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,540
- 你会死的 - 适量使用不会致命
- You could die! - Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1242
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,000
何况禁欲也不会永生
and abstinence is not immortality.

1243
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,130
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1244
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,920
我在查艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂
Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.

1245
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,370
我们是该查一查
Oh, I suppose we should.

1246
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,290
我有军情五处资料的最高访问权
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.

1247
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,170
我已经进去查了
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1248
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,540
你觉得军情五处的保卫系统怎么样
What do you think of MI5 security?

1249
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,120
我觉得设立保卫系统 这个点子不错
I think it would be a good idea.

1250
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,850
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂 "悬案" 像他说的一样
Emelia Ricoletti, "Unsolved", like he says.

1251
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,790
你们能不能安静一会儿 我得回去
Could you all just shut up for five minutes! I have to go back.

1252
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:45,990
要不是你们跑上来乱叫
I was nearly there before

1253
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,910
我马上就能解出来了
you stepped on and started yapping away!

1254
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,330
"乱叫" 不好意思 是我们打断了你的思路吗
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session?

1255
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:53,080
- 夏洛克 听我说 - 不听 你只会说个没完没了
- Sherlock, listen to me. - No, it only encourages you.

1256
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,120
- 我没生你的气 - 那我真松了口气啊
- I'm not angry with you. - Oh, that's a relief!

1257
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,660
我本来一直担心 不 等等 我其实并不担心
I was really worried... No, hold on, I really wasn't.

1258
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,750
我曾经救过你
I was there for you before.

1259
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,250
下一次我也会救你
I'll be there for you again.

1260
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,000
我会一直守护着你
I'll always be there for you.

1261
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,410
这都是我的错
This was my fault.

1262
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,160
这事跟你没关系
It was nothing to do with you.

1263
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,390
我应该想到 在监狱里的那一周
A week in a prison cell, I should have realised.

1264
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,410
- 想到什么 - 对你来说
- Realised what? - That, in your case,

1265
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,150
单独监禁是把你
solitary confinement is

1266
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,160
和最强大的敌人 锁在了一起
locking you up with your worst enemy.

1267
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,660
- 老天爷啊 - 吗啡还是可卡因
- Oh, for God's sake! - Morphine or cocaine?

1268
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,620
- 你说什么 - 我什么都没说
- What did you say? - I didn't say anything.

1269
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,530
不 你说了 你说
No, you did, you said...

1270
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,610
今天又是哪种毒品 吗啡还是可卡因
Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine.

1271
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,370
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1272
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,910
吗啡还是可卡因 你今天用的哪种毒品
Morphine or cocaine... which is it today?

1273
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,220
回答我 该死的
Answer me, damn it!

1274
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,420
莫里亚蒂来过了
Moriarty was here.

1275
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,570
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty's dead.

1276
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,700
- 我刚在飞机上 - 你说什么
- I was on a jet. - A what?

1277
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,360
你和迈克罗夫特都在那里
You were there, and Mycroft.

1278
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,650
你没离开过这个房间 福尔摩斯
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.

1279
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,820
你甚至动也没动过
You... haven't... moved.

1280
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,990
好吧 告诉我 吗啡还是可卡因
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1281
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,860
可卡因 浓度百分之七的溶液
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1282
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,030
- 你要来点吗 - 不要
- Would you care to try it? - No.

1283
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,700
但是我倒是愿意把你
But I would quite like to find

1284
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,490
所有的可卡因都找出来
every ounce of the stuff

1285
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,860
然后倒出窗外去
in your possession and pour it out of the window.

1286
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,530
那我得阻止你
I should be inclined to stop you.

1287
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,360
那你会被强迫面对现实
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly,

1288
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,900
看清咱们俩谁是军人 谁又是瘾君子
which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.

1289
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,940
你不是军人 你是个医生
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.

1290
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,190
我是军医
I'm an army doctor,

1291
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,330
也就是说我能边打碎
which means I could break

1292
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,230
你身上的每一根骨头 一边说出它们的学名
every bone in your body while naming them.

1293
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,400
亲爱的华生 你让情感蒙蔽了判断力
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.

1294
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
绝不这么做
Never on a case.

1295
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,150
你答应过我 绝不这么做的
You promised me, never on a case.

1296
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,050
不 这只不过是 你故事中写的而已
No, I just said that in one of your stories.

1297
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,890
听着 我乐意为了你装傻
Listen, I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1298
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,720
如果你想 我会像个白痴一样 跟在你身后
I will run along behind you like some halfwit,

1299
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,970
让你看上去更机智一些
making you look clever, if that's what you need.

1300
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:59,890
但是老天爷啊 你得对自己 要求更高一些
But dear God above, you will hold yourself to a higher standard!

1301
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,970
- 为什么 - 因为人们需要你这样做
- Why? - Because people need you to.

1302
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:04,260
什么人 为什么 就因为你那些愚蠢的故事吗
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories?

1303
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,550
是啊 就因为我那些愚蠢的故事
Yes, because of my "Idiot stories".

1304
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,430
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes!

1305
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,370
福尔摩斯先生 有电报 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes, telegram, Mr. Holmes.

1306
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,720
是什么 出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

1307
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,050
- 是玛丽 - 玛丽 她怎么了
- It's Mary. - Mary? What about her?

1308
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,550
- 她很有可能有危险 - 什么危险
- It's entirely possible she's in danger. - Danger?

1309
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:31,720
- 没时间解释了 - 你是嗑高了 在说胡话吗
- There's not a moment to lose. - Is this the cocaine talking?

1310
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,130
玛丽能有什么危险
What danger could Mary be in?

1311
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,450
我确定她正和朋友在一起呢
I'm sure she's just visiting with friends.

1312
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:36,470
快来
Come on!

1313
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:46,010
发生了什么事 你神智还清醒吗
What is happening? Are you even in a fit state?

1314
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,380
为了玛丽的事 当然了 别在这一点上怀疑我 华生
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson.

1315
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,260
别再这么做了
Never that.

1316
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,960
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1317
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,300
我没事 我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1318
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,550
别戴那顶帽子
Not that one!

1319
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,670
戴这顶帽子
This one.

1320
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,380
- 为什么 - 你是夏洛克·福尔摩斯 戴你该戴的帽子
- Why? - You're Sherlock Holmes. Wear the damn hat.

1321
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,590
马车 马车
Cab! Cab!

1322
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,500
告诉我 她在哪里
So tell me, where is she?

1323
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,540
你必须告诉我 发生了什么事情
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1324
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,880
老好人华生
Oh, good old Watson!

1325
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,460
你不问点问题 咱们还真没事干啊
How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?!

1326
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,130
夏洛克 快说我老婆在哪里 混蛋
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is, you pompous prick,

1327
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,920
不然我就揍得你两眼发黑
or I'll punch your lights out!

1328
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,880
福尔摩斯 她在哪里
Holmes, where is she?

1329
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,960
她在一座废弃的教堂里
A de-sanctified church.

1330
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,810
她觉得自己发现了解决办法
She thinks she's found the solution and,

1331
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:39,250
就因为这个原因
for no better reason than that,

1332
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,080
她将自己置身于 巨大的危机中
she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.

1333
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:44,080
你真是选了个好老婆啊
What an excellent choice of wife.

1334
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,210
真是见鬼了
What the devil?!

1335
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,580
我找到她们了
I've found them.

1336
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,410
- 这是什么情况 玛丽 - 这是整件事的核心 约翰
- What is all this, Mary? - This is the heart of it all, John.

1337
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,330
这是整个阴谋的关键
The heart of the conspiracy.

1338
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:36,580
天啊 这是什么地方
Great God, what is this place?

1339
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,740
你到底在这里做什么
And what the devil are you doing here?!

1340
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,160
我一直在做调查
I've been making enquiries.

1341
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,910
福尔摩斯先生让我做的
Mr. Holmes asked me.

1342
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,240
福尔摩斯 你怎么能这样做
Holmes, how could you?

1343
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,910
不是他 是更聪明那个福尔摩斯
No, not him, the clever one.

1344
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,230
我觉得很明显
It seemed obvious to me

1345
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,700
这件事情不可能是独自策划的
that this business could not be managed alone.

1346
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,410
我认为瑞克莱蒂太太有帮手
My theory is that Mrs. Ricoletti had help.

1347
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,990
她的朋友在帮她
Help from her friends.

1348
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,160
真精彩 玛丽 "更聪明的那位福尔摩斯"
Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?"

1349
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,870
我 我以为要失去你了
I... I thought I was losing you.

1350
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,450
我以为我们一直在
I thought perhaps we were...

1351
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,070
- 忽视彼此 - 是你要搬出去的
- neglecting each other. - Well, you're the one who moved out.

1352
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,530
我在跟玛丽说话
I was talking to Mary.

1353
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,740
你在替迈克罗夫特工作吗
You're working for Mycroft?

1354
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,950
他想监视这位疯狂的兄弟
He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.

1355
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:15,410
手边还有个间谍做任务 你没发现
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you

1356
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,550
你妻子作为一个护士 有点太能干了吗
your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?

1357
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,240
当然没发现 因为他知道护士的能力所在
Of course it hasn't, because he knows what a nurse is capable of.

1358
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,610
- 你什么时候开始这么想的 - 就刚刚
- When did it occur to you? - Only now, I'm afraid.

1359
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:27,280
作为一个反应慢的小弟弟 你一定过得很辛苦吧
Must be difficult, being the slow little brother.

1360
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,950
真是不堪回首 我们说得够多了 还是集中注意力吧
Time I sped up. Enough chatter, let's concentrate.

1361
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,240
你说得对 这是怎么回事
Yes, all right. What's all this about?

1362
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,740
他们要干什么
What do they want to accomplish?

1363
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,070
我们为何不走近弄个明白
Why don't we go and find out.

1364
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,610
抱歉 我见锣就想敲
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1365
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:00,610
- 见到闹剧 就想插一脚 - 真是没想到
- Or a touch of the dramatic. - Never have guessed!

1366
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,900
虽然在这方面 你们好像跟我一样热情
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.

1367
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,280
棒极了
Excellent.

1368
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,690
顶级的剧场
Superlative theatre.

1369
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,860
我真是欣赏这场面
I applaud the spectacle.

1370
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:16,820
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂饮弹自尽
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1371
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:20,360
然后死而复生 谋杀了她的丈夫
then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.

1372
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,570
所以
So...

1373
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,900
她是怎么做到的
how was it done?

1374
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,900
我们来按顺序理清一下真相吧
Let's take the events in order.

1375
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,740
瑞克莱蒂夫人用
Mrs. Ricoletti gets

1376
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,940
非常有效的方式 吸引了所有人的注意
everyone's attention in very efficient fashion.

1377
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,610
是你
You!

1378
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:38,600
是你吗
You?!

1379
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,440
还是我
Or me?

1380
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,520
她把一只手枪放进嘴里
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth,

1381
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,850
实际上开火的 是另一只口朝下的枪
while actually firing the other into the ground.

1382
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,940
她的同伙在窗帘上撒上了血液
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood

1383
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,400
因此楼下受惊的人们
and thus her apparent suicide

1384
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,060
就都目击到了她的自杀
is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.

1385
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,370
一具跟瑞克莱蒂太太十分相似的
A substitute corpse,

1386
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,600
尸体取而代之出现在了她的位置
bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Ricoletti

1387
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,390
并随后被送去了太平间
takes her place and is later transported to the morgue,

1388
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,600
这对于苏格兰警察来说
a grubby little suicide

1389
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,770
只是毫无兴趣的小自杀案
of little interest to Scotland Yard.

1390
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,690
同时 真正的瑞克莱蒂夫人溜走了
Meanwhile, the real Mrs. Ricoletti slips away.

1391
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,350
然后就到了十分聪明的环节了
Now comes the really clever part.

1392
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,470
瑞克莱蒂夫人说服了
Mrs. Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver,

1393
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,310
一位认识她的马车夫
someone who knew her,

1394
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,980
在她丈夫最喜欢去的鸦片馆外截住了他
to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.

1395
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,480
那里是上演一场绝妙闹剧的最佳舞台
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.

1396
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,270
你是谁 你想做什么
Who are you? What do you want?

1397
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,020
艾美莉亚
Emelia?

1398
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,310
救命
Help!

1399
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,600
完美的身份认证
A perfect positive identification.

1400
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,930
瑞克莱蒂夫人死而复生
The late Mrs. Ricoletti has returned from the grave

1401
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,930
加上高超的装扮
and a little skilled make-up

1402
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:38,720
就塑造出了复仇怨灵的熊熊怒火
and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1403
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,930
最后只剩下一件事
There was only one thing left to do.

1404
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,800
快点动手 你不必感到难过
Swiftly now. No tears.

1405
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,590
最后只需将真的瑞克莱蒂夫人
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs. Ricoletti

1406
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,260
替换掉太平间里的假尸体就行了
for the corpse in the morgue.

1407
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,220
这下 就算有人想要验尸
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her,

1408
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,760
那也毫无疑问的就是她了
it would be positively, absolutely her.

1409
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,800
但她为什么要这么做
But why would she do that?

1410
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,510
为了证明观点而去死吗
Die to prove a point?

1411
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:17,930
所有的伟业都有殉道者
Every great cause has martyrs.

1412
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:22,590
所有战争都需要牺牲 没错 这就是一场战争
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.

1413
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,380
半数的人类正在与另外半数交战
One half of the human race at war with the other.

1414
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,470
一支近在咫尺的无形军队
The invisible army hovering at our elbow,

1415
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,590
照料着我们的家园
tending to our homes,

1416
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:33,970
养育着我们的孩子
raising our children.

1417
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:37,880
他们却被忽视着 被轻视着
Ignored, patronised,

1418
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,550
被蔑视着
disregarded.

1419
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,340
甚至不允许有投票的权利
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1420
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,550
然而这毕竟是支军队
But an army nonetheless,

1421
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,670
她们已经为了崇高的伟业而崛起
ready to rise up in the best of causes.

1422
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,880
纠正人类有史以来就固存的不公
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.

1423
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,300
华生 你看 迈克罗夫特说得对
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.

1424
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,170
这是一场我们必定会输的战争
This is a war we must lose.

1425
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,590
她已经病入膏肓了
She was dying.

1426
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,170
- 谁 - 艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂
- Who was? - Emelia Ricoletti.

1427
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,940
她有明显的肺病症状
There were clear signs of consumption...

1428
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,880
她应该不久于世了
I doubt she wasn't long for this world.

1429
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,170
所以她决定让自己死得其所
So she decided to make her death count.

1430
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,580
她对美国的秘密社交圈很熟悉
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.

1431
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,500
并且她有办法
And was able to draw on their methods of fear

1432
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,960
公开敞亮地进行威胁恐吓
and intimidation to publicly, very publicly,

1433
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,420
逼尤斯塔斯·卡迈克尔爵士 直面他犯下的罪恶
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.

1434
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,130
他在美国就认识她了
He knew her out in the States.

1435
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,420
许诺给她一切
Promised her everything.

1436
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,710
婚姻 地位
Marriage, position.

1437
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,290
之后他不过是玩弄她
And then he had his way with her...

1438
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,330
抛弃她
and threw her over.

1439
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:53,330
留她一人 身无分文
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1440
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:54,620
霍珀
Hooper!

1441
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,460
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

1442
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,080
郑重声明 福尔摩斯 她可没骗过我
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.

1443
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,500
为什么你从不提及我 先生
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1444
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:20,410
艾美莉亚以为 和瑞克莱蒂在一起就能幸福
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti,

1445
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,180
但他也是个畜生
but he was a brute too.

1446
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:31,680
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂是我们的朋友
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1447
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,390
你根本想不到 那个混账如何对待她
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.

1448
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:39,890
但新娘呢 福尔摩斯 我们看到过她的
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1449
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,100
没错 华生 我们看到过
Yes, Watson, we did.

1450
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,140
那个碎玻璃的声音吗
The sound of breaking glass?

1451
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,100
当时碎的不是窗户
Not a window,

1452
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,390
这不过是古老的戏剧诡计
just an old theatrical trick.

1453
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,760
- 这不可能是真的 福尔摩斯 - 是不可能
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot! - No, it can't.

1454
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:54,430
那叫做佩珀尔幻象
It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1455
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,850
在镜中反射出活人的身影
A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.

1456
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:05,010
他们唯一的纰漏 就是弄碎了玻璃
Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'

1457
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,720
看看四周
Look around you.

1458
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,970
房间里全是新娘
This room is full of brides.

1459
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,220
一旦她站出来
Once she had risen,

1460
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,720
任何人都能成为她
anyone could be her.

1461
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,090
复仇的鬼魂
The avenging ghost.

1462
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:28,970
是一个让心怀恶意的男人
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man

1463
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:30,970
恐惧不已的传说
with malicious intent.

1464
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:33,720
一个追踪没有得到恶报的混蛋
A spectre to stalk those unpunished brutes

1465
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,840
要与之清算过去的幽灵
whose reckoning is long overdue.

1466
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:40,090
复仇女神觉醒了
A league of furies awakened.

1467
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,840
那位我
The women I...

1468
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,590
我们 欺骗过背叛过的女人
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1469
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:49,590
我们忽视和蔑视的女人
The women we have ignored and disparaged.

1470
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,130
一旦产生了这样的想法
Once the idea exists,

1471
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:01,420
就难很消除了
it cannot be killed.

1472
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,960
一个目标坚定的人才能做到这样
This is the work of a single-minded person.

1473
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,590
她还非常了解 尤斯塔斯爵士的精神虐待
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1474
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,960
了解他阴暗的秘密
The dark secret,

1475
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,210
这只有她最好的朋友才知道
kept from all but her closest friends,

1476
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,010
包括艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1477
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:21,630
这位曾多年前遭受丈夫虐待的女人
the woman her husband wronged all those years before.

1478
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,920
如果忽略鬼魂
If one disregards the ghost,

1479
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,550
那就只有一个嫌疑人了
there is only one suspect.

1480
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,340
是吧 卡迈克尔夫人
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1481
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,460
但还有个小地方 我不太明白
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.

1482
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,040
为什么要找我来阻止
Why engage me to prevent

1483
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,080
这件你打算实施的谋杀
a murder you intended to commit?

1484
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,460
"我不太明白 不应该是这样啊"
"Doesn't quite make sense, doesn't quite make sense."

1485
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,000
你当然不明白 因为这不是真的
Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.

1486
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:55,630
夏洛克
Oh, Sherlock.

1487
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,540
躲猫猫
Peek-a-boo.

1488
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,920
不
No.

1489
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,750
不 不是你
No, not you.

1490
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,290
不可能是你
It can't be you.

1491
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,910
得了吧 好好想想
I mean, come on, be serious.

1492
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,540
服装 锣
The costumes, the gong?

1493
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,500
作为一个超级反派
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1494
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,710
我们并没有真的锣 或者特殊的服装
we don't really have gongs or special outfits.

1495
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,910
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1496
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,460
这对你来说够蠢吗
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1497
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:29,250
哥特风够浓吗 够疯狂吗 即使对你而言
Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you?

1498
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:33,390
你想不明白 夏洛克 是因为这不是真的
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock, because it's not real.

1499
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:36,950
- 一切都不是真的 - 他在说什么
- None of it. - What's he talking about?

1500
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,580
这些都是你的幻想
This is all in your mind.

1501
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,510
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1502
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,640
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

1503
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,830
你在做梦
You're dreaming.

1504
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,490
他在做梦吗
Is he dreaming?

1505
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,580
他醒了
And there he is.

1506
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,280
我们还以为 你要死了呢
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1507
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:56,490
容我问一下 这就是你说的"控制用量"吗
May I just check, is this what you mean by "Controlled usage"?

1508
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,660
艾美莉亚·瑞克莱蒂太太 告诉我她埋在哪里
Mrs. Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.

1509
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,330
- 一百二十年前被埋在哪里吗 - 是的
- What, 120 years ago? - Yes.

1510
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:06,410
如果还有记录 也得花几周时间来查
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.

1511
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,620
- 即使是动用我的资源 - 查到了
- Even with my resources. - Got it.

1512
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,120
我不明白 这一切有什么关联
I don't get it, how is this relevant?

1513
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,030
我要知道自己是对的 然后我才能肯定
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.

1514
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,530
- 你是说莫里亚蒂怎么做到的 - 没错
- You mean how Moriarty did it? - Yes.

1515
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,950
但这些都不是真实发生的 是你自己想的
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.

1516
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:20,530
我的调查是幻想中的
My investigation was the fantasy,

1517
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:22,450
但犯罪方式和我的解释一样
the crime happened exactly as I explained.

1518
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,570
墓碑是她朋友们立的
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.

1519
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,270
你想在这里找什么
I don't know what you think you'll find here.

1520
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,830
我得试试
I need to try!

1521
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,060
瑞克莱蒂太太被埋在这里
Mrs. Ricoletti was buried here,

1522
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,650
但另一具尸体呢
but what happened to the other one?

1523
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:41,820
在那场所谓的自杀后 代替她的尸体
The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?

1524
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,200
- 他们肯定搬走了 - 但搬到哪里去了
- They'd move it, of course they would. - But where?

1525
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,860
反正不在这里
Well, not here.

1526
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,280
但他们肯定会这么做
But that... That's exactly what they must have done.

1527
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,280
同谋者都是有内应的
The conspirators had someone on the inside.

1528
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,310
他们找到一具尸体
They found a body, just

1529
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,360
就像莫莉·霍珀给我找了具尸体
like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when...

1530
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,860
我们不用再说一遍那件事了 对吧
Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?

1531
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,610
你不是真的要这样做吧
You're not seriously going to do this?

1532
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,940
我们就是为这个来的 我需要答案
It's why we came here. I need to know.

1533
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,440
简直是瘾君子的口吻
Spoken like an addict.

1534
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,400
- 这对我来说很重要 - 不 这说明你得接受治疗
- This is important to me! - No, this is you needing a fix.

1535
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,860
- 约翰 - 莫里亚蒂回来了
- John... - Moriarty's back.

1536
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,590
我们有案子 真实生活中 我们有问题需要解决
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.

1537
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:11,200
等一下就解决它 先让我把这事做完
Getting to that, it's next on the list. Just let me do this.

1538
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,530
不行 大家总是让你为所欲为
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.

1539
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,410
- 所以你才变成现在这样 - 约翰 拜托
- That's how you got in this state! - John, please...

1540
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,760
这次我不奉陪了 夏洛克 再也不了
I'm not playing this time, Sherlock. Not any more!

1541
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,710
等你准备好工作了 再给我打电话
When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.

1542
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,580
- 我要带玛丽回家了 - 你说什么
- I'm taking Mary home. - You're what?

1543
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,460
- 玛丽要带我回家了 - 这还差不多
- Mary's taking me home. - Better.

1544
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,830
- 他说得对 - 那又怎样
- He's right, you know. - So what if he's right?!

1545
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,330
他总是对的 这太无聊了
He's always right, it's boring!

1546
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,710
你会帮我吗
Will you help me?

1547
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,330
找出那个女人
Cherchez la femme.

1548
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,280
上帝啊
Oh, dear.

1549
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,580
这里已经囊空如洗了
The cupboard is bare.

1550
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,990
他们肯定把她埋在下面了
They must have buried it underneath.

1551
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,870
肯定埋在棺材下面了
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.

1552
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,780
你运气不好啊 夏洛克
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1553
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,950
或许他们用其他方式处理了尸体
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.

1554
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,440
- 不 - 很有可能
- No... - More than likely.

1555
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,780
毕竟这是很久以前的事了
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.

1556
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,070
我们眼下还有
We do have slightly more

1557
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,280
更紧迫的事要办 弟弟
pressing matters to hand, little brother.

1558
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,700
莫里亚蒂 死而复生
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1559
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,950
勿忘我
Do not forget me.

1560
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:15,740
勿忘我
Do not forget me!

1561
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,570
这里
This?

1562
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:32,860
我明白了
Oh, I see.

1563
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:36,400
我还是没醒 对吧
Still not awake, am I?

1564
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:05,860
太深了 夏洛克 你陷得太深了
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1565
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,860
恭喜你 将会成为有史以来第一位
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history

1566
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,060
埋在自己思维殿堂里的人
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1567
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,100
这场景也太夸张了 你不觉得吗
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think?

1568
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,480
对你我而言
For you and me?

1569
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,180
一点都不夸张
Not at all.

1570
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,100
你到底是什么东西
What are you?

1571
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,180
你知道我是什么东西
You know what I am.

1572
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,100
我是莫里亚蒂
I'm Moriarty.

1573
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,890
犯罪界的拿破仑
The Napoleon of Crime.

1574
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:34,430
- 莫里亚蒂已经死了 - 在你脑中可没有
- Moriarty's dead! - Not in your mind.

1575
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:36,760
我在你的脑海里永存
I'll never be dead there.

1576
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,760
你曾把自己的大脑称为硬盘
You once called your brain a hard drive.

1577
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,470
现在 和病毒打声招呼吧
Well, say hello to the virus.

1578
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,430
这就是我们的结局
This is how we end, you and I.

1579
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,760
永远在这里
Always here,

1580
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,140
永远都在一起
always together.

1581
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,050
你的想法很棒 莫里亚蒂
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.

1582
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:57,010
我很佩服
I admire it.

1583
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:00,800
我承认或许 它能和我的大脑相提并论
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.

1584
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,220
我很感动
I'm touched.

1585
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,050
我很荣幸
I'm honoured.

1586
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:08,760
但说到在悬崖边上
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat

1587
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,870
徒手格斗
on the edge of a precipice...

1588
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,760
你只有落水的份
you're going in the water,

1589
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,130
小个子
short-arse.

1590
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,090
你觉得自己很高大勇猛吗 夏洛克
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock!

1591
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:33,660
我可不敢苟同
Not with me.

1592
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,580
我就是你的弱点
I am your weakness!

1593
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,330
我能打倒你
I keep you down!

1594
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:58,540
你的每一次跌倒 失败
Every time you stumble, every time you fail,

1595
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:00,120
每一次的弱势
when you're weak,

1596
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,370
我都
I... am...

1597
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,910
在那里
there!

1598
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,950
不
No,

1599
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,740
你别再试着抵抗了
don't try to fight it.

1600
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,370
躺好认输吧
Lie back and lose!

1601
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,990
我们一起跳下去吧
Shall we go over together?

1602
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:21,820
必须是一起跳 对吧
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1603
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:25,240
最终 永远都是
At the end it's always just you

1604
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
你和我
and me!

1605
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,700
教授 麻烦你离我的朋友远一点
Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend,

1606
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,110
我相信 他很讨厌你的行为
I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.

1607
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:44,780
这不公平 你们有两个人
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1608
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,160
我们一直是两个人 你没看过斯特兰德报吗
There's always two of us. Don't you read The Strand?

1609
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,860
跪下 教授
On your knees, Professor.

1610
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,950
把手放到头上
Hands behind your head.

1611
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,570
谢谢你 约翰
Thank you, John.

1612
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,240
你什么时候开始叫我约翰了
Since when do you call me John?

1613
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,030
生活处处充满惊喜
You'd be surprised.

1614
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,360
那倒未必
No, I wouldn't.

1615
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,530
该醒来了 夏洛克
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1616
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,280
我是写故事的人 我知道自己在哪里
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.

1617
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,190
当然
Of course.

1618
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:20,570
你当然知道 约翰
Of course you do, John.

1619
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,150
那他长什么样
So what's he like?

1620
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:25,610
另一个世界的我
The other me in the other place?

1621
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:29,020
比他看上去更聪明
Smarter than he looks.

1622
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,530
那肯定是聪明绝顶了
Pretty damn smart, then.

1623
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,360
是 聪明绝顶
Pretty damn smart.

1624
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,270
天啊 你俩干脆直接私奔吧
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?!

1625
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:39,110
你真是粗鲁
Impertinent.

1626
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:40,900
你真是无礼
Offensive.

1627
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,650
介意我来吗
Actually, would you mind?

1628
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:44,860
一点也不
Not at all.

1629
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,520
- 总算轮到我了 - 是啊
- It was my turn. - Quite so.

1630
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,190
你打算怎么醒过来
So how do you plan to wake up?

1631
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,560
我觉得应该这样做
I should think like this.

1632
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,270
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1633
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:11,600
只限于我们之间的秘密 约翰 坠落是杀不死我的
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.

1634
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,900
可你怎么做到的
But how?

1635
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,150
很简单 亲爱的华生
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1636
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,470
- 想我了吗 - 夏洛克 你还好吗
- Miss me? - Sherlock, are you all right?

1637
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:53,220
当然 我为什么不好
Yes. Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?

1638
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,970
因为你可能服药过量 你应该去医院
Because you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.

1639
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,760
没时间了
Hm, no time.

1640
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:00,420
我现在得去贝克街 莫里亚蒂回来了
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.

1641
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,810
我倒是希望他回来了
I almost hope he is,

1642
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,110
如果这能让你不再沉浸于此
if it'll save you from this.

1643
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:10,850
现在不需要这个了 我有正事要办
No need for that now, I've got the real thing.

1644
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,640
- 我有工作要做 - 夏洛克
- I have work to do. - Sherlock...

1645
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,680
答应我
promise me.

1646
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:18,930
你还站在这里干什么
What are you still doing here?

1647
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:21,430
你快帮我弄个赦免令什么的啊
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something,

1648
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,720
像个大哥该有的样子
like a proper big brother?

1649
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,470
华生医生
Dr. Watson...

1650
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,140
照顾好他
Look after him.

1651
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,390
拜托了
Please.

1652
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:02,800
夏洛克 等等 解释一下 莫里亚蒂还活着吗
Sherlock, hang on, explain. Moriarty's alive, then?

1653
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,010
我没说他还活着 我是说他回来了
I never said he was alive, I said he was back.

1654
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:06,460
那他死了吗
So he's dead?

1655
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:07,650
他当然死了
Of course he's dead, he

1656
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:10,010
他脑袋都开花了 不可能活下来
blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.

1657
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:13,670
我刚为了证明这一点 还服药过量了
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.

1658
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:16,170
莫里亚蒂死了 这毋庸置疑
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1659
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:21,420
但重要的是 我很清楚他接下来 要做什么事情
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1660
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:33,710
航空器
Flying machines,

1661
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:36,130
还有什么 电话工具
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1662
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,840
都是些什么疯狂的幻想啊
What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?

1663
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,120
这只是我对
It was simply my conjecture

1664
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,920
未来世界
of what a future world might look like

1665
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,500
还有你和我在其中的猜测
and how you and I might fit inside it.

1666
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,880
逻辑学家能从一滴掉落的水珠
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer

1667
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,540
推测出它是来自大西洋 还是尼亚加拉河
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1668
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,130
或者是莱辛巴赫瀑布
Or a Reichenbach?

1669
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,930
这件你极度重视的案子 写好了吗
Have you written up your account of the case?

1670
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,250
当然
Yes.

1671
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:57,330
修改后是我罕见未能破获的案子 对吧
Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course?

1672
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:58,350
是的
Of course.

1673
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,420
隐形军队的
The Adventure Of...

1674
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,790
大冒险
The Invisible Army.

1675
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:08,080
复仇女神
The League Of Furies?

1676
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,250
还是恐怖军团
The Monstrous Regiment?

1677
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,650
我更喜欢可恶的新娘
I rather thought The Abominable Bride.

1678
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,350
有点骇人听闻
A trifle lurid.

1679
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,560
但肯定畅销 它里面还有谋杀呢
It'll sell. It's got proper murders in it too.

1680
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,960
你是专家嘛
You're the expert.

1681
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,160
至于你的故事
As for your own tale,

1682
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:27,040
你确定只用了百分之七的溶液吗
are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take?

1683
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,250
我认为你可能加大了剂量
I think you may have increased the dosage.

1684
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,540
或许我想象力太丰富了
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.

1685
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:35,250
但或许这些事真的会实现
But perhaps such things could come to pass.

1686
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,410
无论如何 我相信自己 会很适应那个世界
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.

1687
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,160
- 我不认为我能 - 我可不这样认为
- Huh, I don't think I would be. - I beg to differ.

1688
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,570
但我一直知道自己 是超越时代的人
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
