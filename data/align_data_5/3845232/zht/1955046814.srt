00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,680
《新福爾摩斯》前情提要

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,610
我叫夏洛克·福爾摩斯
The name's Sherlock Holmes

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,270
地址是貝克街221B
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,570
午安
Afternoon.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,720
嗯
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,320
他就這德行
He's always like that.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,200
今天不太順哈
Bad day was it?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,920
你們昨天才成為室友
Since yesterday you've moved in with him

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,210
現在又一起查案
and now you're solving crimes together.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,630
死了人你這麼開心  真不得體
Look at you, all happy, it's not decent.

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,820
管他得不得體
Who cares about decent?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,280
赫德森太太  遊戲開始了
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,100
約翰  別搞英雄崇拜
Don't make people into heroes, John.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,610
英雄從不存在  即使有  也不包括我
Heroes don't exist if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,410
我會讓你心如刀絞
I will burn the HEART out of you.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,400
好了  這就行了
Right, this should do it.

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,480
你穿了褲子嗎
You wearing any pants?

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,970
- 沒有  - 好吧
- No. - OK.

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,310
我就想你記住這樣的我
This is how I want you to remember me,

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
打敗了你的女人
the woman who beat you.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,340
但其實根本就沒有什麼怪物
But there never was any monster.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,900
夏洛克
Sherlock?

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,630
終於見面了
Here we are, at last.

24
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,720
- 再見  約翰  - 夏洛克
- Goodbye, John. - Sherlock!

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,320
那東西會要了你的命
Those things will kill you.

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,880
你這個混蛋
Oh, you bastard!

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,510
那追逐的刺激  血脈噴張的感覺
The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins,

28
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,180
我們兩個人一起對抗整個世界
just the two of us against the rest of the world.

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,180
等等
Wait!

30
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,850
我們得協調一致才行
We're going to need to coordinate.

31
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,320
我要你再給我一個奇跡
I asked you for one more miracle.

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,770
我求你不要死
I asked you to stop being dead.

33
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,570
我聽到了
I heard you.

34
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,750
閉嘴  你根本不是解謎人
Shut up! You are not a puzzle solver, you never have been.

35
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,630
你只會小題大做
You're a drama queen!

36
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,450
現在裡面有人就快死了
Now there is a man in there about to die.

37
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,460
遊戲開始了  解開它
The game is on, solve it!

38
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,130
他就是勒索界的拿破崙
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

39
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,290
你這次當不成英雄了  福爾摩斯先生
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

40
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,870
我是高智商反社會人格
I'm a high-functioning sociopath!

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,380
不論我們把夏洛克關在哪
There is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock

42
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,090
他都會每天製造暴亂
without causing a riot on a daily basis.

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,470
而另一個辦法  則需要你的獲准
The alternative, however, would require your approval.

44
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,730
敬那些美好的時光  約翰
To the very best of times, John.

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,280
想我了嗎
Did you miss me?

46
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,450
想我了嗎
Did you miss me?

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,540
這怎麼可能
How is this possible?

48
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,920
流放感覺如何
How is the exile going?

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,300
我才走了四分鐘
I've only been gone four minutes.

50
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,600
希望你吸取教訓了
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
這次又是誰需要我
Who needs me this time?

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,070
想我了嗎
Miss me?

53
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,180
英國需要你
England.

54
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,220
在另一個世界

55
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,600
第二次阿富汗戰爭令很多人載譽而歸  加官進爵
"The Second Afghan War brought honours and promotion to many.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,310
但對我而言  那就是一場徹頭徹尾的悲劇和災難
"But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster."

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,860
沒事了  上尉
All right, Captain.

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,850
我重返英國  身體落下了終身的傷痛
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined

59
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,530
前途一片黯淡
"and my future bleak.

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,930
鑒於此  我自然搬來了倫敦
"Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,150
這裡是英帝國的遊手好閒者
"That great cesspool into which all the loungers..."

62
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,890
- 華生  - 及閒散人士的集聚之所
- Watson! - "..and idlers of the empire are drained."

63
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,040
華生
Watson!

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
我是史丹佛
Stamford.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,890
還記得我嗎
Remember?

66
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,970
我們以前一起在巴茨醫院共事
We were at Barts together.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,850
當然記得  史丹佛
Yes, of course. Stamford.

68
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,150
老天爺  你這是跑哪混去了
Good Lord! Where have you been?

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,930
搞得骨瘦如柴的
You're as thin as a rake!

70
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,670
我起碼活著回來了  許多人還沒這個福氣
I made it home. Many weren't so lucky.

71
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,880
那現在呢
So what now?

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,770
我得找個住處落腳
I need a place to live.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
條件好  價格優  這種地方可不好找
Somewhere decent at an affordable price. It's not easy.

74
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,460
今天還有個人和我這麼說過
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,440
是誰
Who was the first?

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,720
老天爺
Good Lord.

77
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,790
據說是個實驗
It's an experiment, apparently.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
鞭笞屍體  以確立在死亡後多久
Beating corpses to establish how long after death

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,980
人體仍能形成瘀傷
bruising is still possible.

80
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,350
這有何醫學意義嗎
Is there a medical point to that?

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,130
我不確定
Not sure.

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,010
我也不確定  你所說的那位朋友呢
Neither am I. So, where's this friend of yours, then?

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,820
不好意思
Excuse me.

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,590
但願我們沒打擾到你
I do hope we're not interrupting.

85
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,490
你去過阿富汗吧
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.

86
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,780
華生醫生  這位是夏洛克先生
Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock...

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,640
反應敏捷  你是個合適人選
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

88
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,950
你說什麼
I'm sorry...?

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,800
我看上了攝政公園附近的一套房子
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,350
我們一起應該能付得起房租
Between us we could afford them.

91
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,290
房子  誰說過房子的事了
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms?

92
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,530
我說過  我今早跟史丹佛提過
I did, I mentioned it to Stamford this morning,

93
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,760
我需要一位元合租者
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,810
而午飯過後
Now he appears after lunch

95
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,650
他便帶來了一位軍人模樣的男子
in the company of a man of military aspect

96
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,940
皮膚曬黑  最近受過傷
with a tan and a recent injury,

97
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,300
這兩點都表明你參加了阿富汗戰爭
both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan

98
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,880
並被迫離開了戰場
and an enforced departure from it.

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,900
所以不難得出結論了
The conclusion seemed inescapable.

100
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,700
我們明晚再敲定細節
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,420
失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

102
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,650
旺茲沃思有一場絞刑
I have a hanging in Wandsworth

103
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,720
我可不想錯過
and I'd hate them to start without me.

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,770
- 絞刑  - 這屬於我的職業範疇
- A hanging? - I take a professional interest.

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,530
我還拉小提琴  抽煙鬥
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.

106
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,000
這應該不成問題吧
I presume that's not a problem.

107
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,870
沒事
Er, no, well...

108
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,770
你顯然習慣了說話被人打斷
And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting to the end of a sentence.

109
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,300
我們會相處得非常愉快
We'll get along splendidly.

110
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,660
那就約好明晚七點
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.

111
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,590
對了  我叫夏洛克·福爾摩斯
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

112
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,950
地址是貝克街221B
and the address is 221B, Baker Street.

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,400
是的  他一直都是這個樣子
Yes...he's always been like that.

114
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,640
2015聖誕特輯

115
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,640
新福爾摩斯

斯特蘭德月刊

117
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,020
斯特蘭德月刊

118
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,540
賣報  賣報
Papers! Papers!

119
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,650
賣報  賣報
Papers! Papers!

120
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,070
喂  《藍寶石奇案》賣得怎麼樣
Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing?

121
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,160
非常受歡迎  華生醫生
Very popular, Dr Watson.

122
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,750
下個月會有正經的謀殺案嗎
Is there going to be a proper murder next month?

123
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,590
我會跟罪犯們談一談
I'll have a word with the criminal classes.

124
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,060
那就拜託你了
If you wouldn't mind.

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,230
那是他嗎  他在車裡嗎
Is that him? Is he in there?

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,500
不  不不  車裡不是他
No. No, no, not at all.

127
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,010
再見
Er, good day to you.

128
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,300
駕
Let on, walk.

129
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,220
聖誕快樂  福爾摩斯先生
Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!

130
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,310
貝克街西

131
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,710
福爾摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

132
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,380
真希望你打算回家之前能跟我打聲招呼
I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home!

133
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,410
連我自己都說不準  赫德森太太
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.

134
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,160
這就是鄉紳分屍案的棘手之處
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.

135
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,310
想提前安排日程真是難如登天
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.

136
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,230
- 這裡面是什麼  - 別管了
- What's in there? - Never mind.

137
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,360
謝謝
Thank you.

138
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,450
你抓到殺人兇手了嗎  福爾摩斯先生
Did you catch the murderer, Mr Holmes?

139
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,180
兇手抓到了  但還在找被肢解的腿
Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.

140
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,640
就算是打了個平手吧
I think we'll call it a draw.

141
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,010
我看到你又發表了一篇故事  華生醫生
And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr Watson.

142
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,640
是的  你喜歡嗎
Yes, did you enjoy it?

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
不喜歡
No.

144
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,410
- 我一直都不喜歡  - 為什麼
- I never enjoy them. - Why not?

145
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,150
我從來連句臺詞都沒有
Well, I never say anything, do I?

146
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,540
據你所寫  我就只負責帶人上樓
According to you, I just show people up the stairs

147
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,890
給你們端早餐而已
and serve you breakfasts.

148
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,960
在故事當中
Well, within the narrative,

149
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,860
這大致上就是你的職能
that is, broadly speaking, your function.

150
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,200
我的什麼
My what?!

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
別覺得受了針對  赫德森太太
Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson,

152
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,190
- 寫狗的那篇我都沒太露臉  - 寫狗的那篇
- I'm hardly in the dog one. - "The dog one?"

153
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,140
我是你們的房東  不是情節設置
I'm your landlady, not a plot device.

154
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,690
你是指《巴斯克維爾的獵犬》嗎
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

155
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,350
而且你把房子寫得那麼沉悶昏暗
And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.

156
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,650
這你得怪插畫家  他簡直胡來
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control!

157
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,630
我還得留小鬍子  好讓大家能認出我來
I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.

158
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,250
這些年來  我很榮幸能夠記錄
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record

159
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,560
我非凡的朋友夏洛克·福爾摩斯先生的功績
"the exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes,

160
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,990
在其眾多的案件中擇一呈現給讀者
"It has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many cases

161
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,110
有時並非易事
"to set before my readers.

162
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,690
有些過於敏感  不便詳述
"Some are still too sensitive to recount,

163
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,930
而有些則尚未淡出公眾腦海
"whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.

164
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,880
但在我們共同經歷的眾多冒險中
"But in all our many adventures together,

165
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,960
還沒有哪件案子
no case pushed my friend

166
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,140
像《恐怖新娘》那樣
to such mental and physical extremes

167
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,780
挑戰我朋友的心理及生理極限
"as that of The Abominable Bride!"

168
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,720
恐怖新娘

169
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,680
老天爺
Good Lord!

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,710
赫德森太太  我的客廳裡有個女人
Mrs Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!

171
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
這是故意的嗎
Is it intentional?

172
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,260
她是客戶
She's a client.

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,300
我說你出去了  她堅持要等
Said you were out, insisted on waiting.

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,870
你想坐下嗎
Would you, er, care to sit down?

175
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,790
你有沒有問她想要什麼
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

176
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,440
你去問她
You ask her!

177
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,230
你為什麼不問她
Why didn't you ask her?

178
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,780
我怎麼問  我又不說話
How could I, what with me not talking and everything?!

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,890
老天爺啊  給她點臺詞
For God's sake, give her some lines,

180
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,900
她完全可以把我們餓死
she's perfectly capable of starving us!

181
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,880
下午好  我是夏洛克·克福爾摩斯
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,940
這是我的朋友兼同事  華生醫生
this is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.

183
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,990
你可以在他面前暢所欲言
You may speak freely in front of him,

184
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,930
- 因為他基本聽不懂  - 福爾摩斯
- as he rarely understands a word. - Holmes!

185
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,730
但在你開口之前
However, before you do,

186
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,030
容我先說說我的幾點觀察
allow me to make some trifling observations.

187
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,680
你有一種惡作劇般的幽默感
You have an impish sense of humour,

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,100
你現在就在以此
which currently you are deploying

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,670
減輕你個人的痛苦
to ease a degree of personal anguish.

190
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,890
你最近嫁給了一個
You have recently married a man

191
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,040
看起來性情溫和的人
of a seemingly kindly disposition,

192
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,150
而他現在為一個
who has now abandoned you

193
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,900
品行有問題的同伴而拋棄了你
for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.

194
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,300
你把來到這裡當做最後的手段
You have come to this agency as a last resort,

195
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,790
以期你們的關係可以得到調解
in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.

196
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,350
我的天啊  福爾摩斯
Good Lord, Holmes!

197
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,260
當然  所有這些都是從你的香水推測得來
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.

198
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,510
她的香水
Her perfume?

199
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,210
對  香水  讓我洞悉一切  卻給你帶來災難
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.

200
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,230
為什麼
How so?

201
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,510
因為我認出了它
Because I recognised it

202
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,370
而你沒有
and you did not.

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,750
- 瑪麗  - 約翰
- Mary! - John.

204
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,360
蒼天在上  你為什麼要扮成客戶
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client?

205
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,940
因為我想不出別的辦法能見我丈夫  丈夫
Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.

206
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,920
那是個國際陰謀事件
It was an affair of international intrigue.

207
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
就是個被謀殺的鄉紳
It was a murdered country squire.

208
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,250
不管怎樣  事情緊急
Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

209
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,090
我不介意你走  親愛的
I don't mind you going, my darling,

210
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,600
- 我介意的是你扔下我  - 但你能做什麼
- I mind you leaving me behind. - But what could you do?!

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,690
那你能做什麼
Well, what do you do,

212
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,780
除了晃來晃去做筆記  時不時目瞪口呆
except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?!

213
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,760
夠了
Enough!

214
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,680
舞臺已經準備好  大幕升起
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

215
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,240
我們可以開始了
We are ready to begin.

216
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,610
開始什麼
Begin what?

217
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,540
有時為了破一個案子  必須先破另一個
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.

218
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,210
你有案子嗎  新案子
Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?

219
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,190
一個老案子  非常老
An old one, very old.

220
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,870
我必須得深入
I shall have to go deep.

221
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,460
深入什麼
Deep? Into what?

222
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
我自己
Myself.

223
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,430
雷斯垂德  別在門外晃了  進來吧
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.

224
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,910
你怎麼知道是我
How did you know it was me?

225
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,010
腳步聲是不會錯的
The regulation tread is unmistakable.

226
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,470
比鐘斯輕  被葛列格森重
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.

227
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,200
我剛上來  哈德森太太不肯說話
I, I just came up... Mrs Hudson didn't seem to be talking.

228
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,310
恐怕她是在用諷刺的方法進行文學批評
I fear she has branched into literary criticism by means of satire.

229
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,850
這是當代房東惱人的發展趨勢
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.

230
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,710
你為何事在下班時間過來
What brings you here in your off-duty hours?

231
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,000
- 你怎麼知道我下班了  - 你到了之後
- How do you know I'm off duty? - Well, since your arrival,

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,420
超過40%的注意力都在我的酒瓶上
you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.

233
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,950
華生  給探長拿點他顯然想要的東西
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.

234
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,480
雷斯垂德  我們能為你做什麼
So...Lestrade, what can we do for you?

235
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,890
我不是為公事來的  我只是想過來看看
Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.

236
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,970
社交拜訪嗎
A social call?

237
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,680
當然  只是想給你帶來節日問候
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.

238
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,410
- 聖誕快樂  - 聖誕快樂
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

239
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,180
可算客套完了
Thank God that's over.

240
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,240
說吧  探長  是什麼奇怪的事讓你來到我家
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door,

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,140
又尷尬得說不出口
but embarrasses you to relate?

242
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,180
誰說出事了
Who said anything happened?

243
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,590
你  雖然你沒有真正說出來
You did. By every means short of actual speech.

244
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,200
福爾摩斯  你誤判了
Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.

245
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
那糾正我一下  醫生
Then, correct me, Doctor.

246
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,560
他不是想要喝一杯  而是需要喝一杯
He didn't want a drink, he needed one.

247
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,430
他不是尷尬  他是害怕
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

248
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,600
我的傳記作者有進步啊  成長得真快
My Boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast.

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,440
華生  給蘇格蘭場壯壯膽子
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.

250
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,010
探長  坐下吧
Inspector, do sit down.

251
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,420
我並不是害怕
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

252
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,640
恐懼是面對危險時的智慧
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger,

253
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,440
這沒什麼難為情的
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

254
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,820
謝謝
Thank you.

255
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,140
從頭開始講吧
From the beginning, then.

256
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,530
你
You!

257
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
不要  拜託
No, please!

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,900
你
You?!

259
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,030
等一下
A moment.

260
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,290
這是什麼時候的事
When was this?

261
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
昨天早上
Yesterday morning.

262
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,930
那個新娘的臉  是怎樣描述的
The bride's face, how was it described?

263
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,730
"像死人一樣蒼白  嘴像一道緋紅的傷口"
"White as death, mouth like a crimson wound."

264
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,250
這是編造還是事實
Poetry or truth?

265
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,950
很多人會說它們是一樣的
Many would say they're the same thing.

266
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,820
對  他們都是白癡  編造還是事實
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

267
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,550
我看到過她的臉  是在後來
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

268
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,200
什麼的後來
After what?

269
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,310
你
You?

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,420
還是我
Or me?

271
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,210
不是吧  雷斯垂德  一個女人當眾飲彈
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public

272
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,750
你還需要我幫忙找出罪犯
and you need help identifying the guilty party?

273
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,930
恐怕蘇格蘭場又刷低了下限
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.

274
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,690
那不是我來的原因
That's not why I'm here.

275
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,440
- 我猜也是  - 她叫什麼名字  那個新娘
- I surmised. - What was her name, the bride?

276
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,060
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂  昨天是她的結婚紀念日
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.

277
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,500
當然  有人報了警
The police, of course, were called.

278
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,880
她的屍體被送到了停屍房
And her body taken to the morgue.

279
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,960
這是標準程式  你為什麼要告訴我們猜得到的事
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?

280
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,520
因為接下來發生的事
Because of what happened next.

281
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,960
幾小時之後  在萊姆豪斯
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

282
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,730
湯瑪斯·瑞克萊蒂  艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂的丈夫
Thomas Ricoletti. Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

283
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,550
大概是在去停屍房辨認遺體的路上吧
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains?

284
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,050
結果他省了這麻煩
As it turned out, he was saved the trip.

285
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,750
*別忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

286
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,220
*別忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

287
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,010
*記住那少女*
*Remember the maid...*

288
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,720
你是誰
Who are you?

289
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,350
*磨坊的少女*
*The maid of the mill...*

290
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,140
你為什麼要這樣做  告訴我你是誰
Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are!

291
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,510
你聽出了我們的歌嗎  親愛的
You recognise our song, my dear?

292
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
我在婚禮上唱過
I sang it at our wedding.

293
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,790
艾米麗婭
Emelia?

294
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,430
你死了  你不可能在這裡  你死了
You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died!

295
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,280
我美吧  湯瑪斯
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

296
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,600
跟你娶我那天一樣美
As beautiful as the day you married me?

297
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,560
- 誰...  - 這是怎麼回事
- Who... - What the hell is all this about?!

298
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,210
你說看起來像什麼  我英俊的朋友
What does it look like, my handsome friend?

299
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,150
這是槍桿下的婚禮[原意:奉子成婚]
It's a shotgun wedding.

300
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,970
直至死亡將我們分離  他們各死了一次
Till death us do part. Twice in this case.

301
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,020
真離奇
Extraordinary.

302
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,400
不可能
Impossible.

303
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,790
太棒了
Superb.

304
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,670
當街自殺  屍體殺人
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.

305
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,910
雷斯垂德  你簡直寵壞我們了
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

306
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,110
華生  拿上帽子和外套
Watson, your hat and coat.

307
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,310
- 我們去哪裡  - 停屍房
- Where are we going? - To the morgue.

308
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,800
一刻也不能耽擱了
There's not a moment to lose,

309
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,490
很少有人會這樣說停屍房
which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

310
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,670
那我就坐在這裡嗎
And am I just to sit here?

311
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,500
當然不了  親愛的  我們之後會餓的
Not at all, my dear. We'll be hungry later.

312
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,220
福爾摩斯  有個問題  穿花呢衣服去停屍房嗎
Holmes, just one thing, tweeds in a morgue?

313
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,690
沒時間換衣服了  華生
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.

314
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,090
再見  夫人
Ma'am.

315
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,840
我參與了一項活動
I'm part of a campaign, you know.

316
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,220
活動
Oh, campaign?

317
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,960
為女性爭取投票權
Votes for women.

318
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,210
你是支持還是反對
And are you for or against?

319
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,840
出去
Get out.

320
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,820
他們又走了  對吧
Have they gone off again, have they?

321
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,950
那些先生們過著什麼樣的生活啊
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.

322
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,840
是啊  那些先生們
Yes. Those gentlemen!

323
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,770
算了
Never you mind.

324
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,670
差點忘了  這是給你的
Almost forgot, that came for you.

325
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,870
速來

326
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,930
赫德森太太  告訴我丈夫我會晚歸
Mrs Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late,

327
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,140
我有些急事
I have some urgent business.

328
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,530
一切還好吧
Is everything all right?

329
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,660
只是有個朋友需要幫助
Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.

330
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,790
天啊  什麼朋友
Oh, dear. What friend?

331
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,750
英格蘭
England.

332
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,860
還真是含糊
Well, that's not very specific.

333
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,850
停屍房誰當班
Who's on mortuary duty?

334
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,150
你知道的
You know who.

335
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,550
總是他
Always him.

336
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,280
拜託告訴我這是哪個白癡幹的
Please tell me which idiot did this!

337
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,470
這是為了大家的安全
It's for everyone's safety.

338
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,960
這女人死了  她半邊頭都不見了
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.

339
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,710
她對誰都不是威脅
She's not a threat to anyone.

340
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,860
跟她的丈夫說去吧  他在那邊的罩單下
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.

341
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,240
不管昨晚在萊姆豪斯發生了什麼
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night,

342
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,490
都可以斷定那不是一個死去的女人幹的
I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.

343
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,130
比這更奇怪的事都發生過
Stranger things have happened.

344
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,760
比如呢
Such as...?

345
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,240
就是...奇怪的事
Well... Strange things.

346
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
你說話跟小孩一樣
You're speaking like a child.

347
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,030
這顯然是活人幹的  他去哪了
This is clearly man's work. Where is he?

348
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,820
福爾摩斯
Holmes.

349
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,110
霍普
Hooper.

350
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,640
你  繼續工作
You, back to work!

351
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,540
你是來變戲法震撼我們了吧
So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose?

352
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,790
你想提醒我注意什麼嗎
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?

353
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,650
完全沒有  福爾摩斯先生
Nothing at all, Mr Holmes.

354
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,900
你想什麼時候走都行
You may leave any time you like.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,460
霍普醫生  是我請福爾摩斯先生來的  合作點
Dr Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes to come here. Cooperate.

356
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,730
這是命令
That's an order.

357
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,800
有兩點"值得注意"
There are two "features of interest",

358
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,570
正如你在華生醫生的故事裡經常說的
as you are always saying in Dr Watson's stories.

359
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,710
我從沒那麼說過
I never say that.

360
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,360
你說過  很多次
You do, actually, quite a lot.

361
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,370
首先  這絕對是艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

362
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,250
她的身份已經確定
She has been categorically identified.

363
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,490
這肯定是她  毫無疑問
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

364
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,510
那昨晚在萊姆豪斯是誰
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?

365
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,630
也是艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

366
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,160
不可能  她死了  躺在這裡
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.

367
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,640
是她自己的丈夫
She was positively identified

368
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,260
在被殺幾秒之前確認的
by her own husband, seconds before he died.

369
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,140
他沒理由撒謊  更不可能搞錯
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.

370
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,880
車夫也認識她  那就是她
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.

371
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,010
但她不可能同時出現在兩個地方  對吧
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she?

372
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,890
是啊  華生  對於剛死的人來說
No, Watson, one place is strictly the limit

373
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,390
他們只能去一個地方
for the recently deceased.

374
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,420
福爾摩斯
Holmes!

375
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,470
- 可能是雙胞胎嗎  - 不
- Could it have been twins? - No.

376
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,200
為什麼
Why not?

377
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,180
因為從來都不是雙胞胎
Because it's never twins.

378
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,460
艾米麗婭沒有雙胞胎  也沒有姐妹
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.

379
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,180
她有一個哥哥  四年前去世了
She had one older brother who died four years ago.

380
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,090
也許是秘密的雙胞胎
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

381
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,560
什麼
A what?!

382
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,850
秘密的雙胞胎
A secret twin.

383
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,320
知道嗎
Hmm? You know?

384
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,780
沒人知道的雙胞胎
A twin that nobody knows about.

385
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,500
這一切可能是策劃好的
This whole thing could have been planned.

386
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,540
從懷孕時開始嗎
Since the moment of conception.

387
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,660
她真是太有先見之明了
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

388
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,720
從來不是雙胞胎  華生
It is never twins, Watson!

389
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,880
那你怎麼看
Then what's your theory?

390
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,720
更重要的是  你什麼毛病
More to the point, what's your problem?

391
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,610
- 我不明白  - 你為什麼這麼害怕
- I, I don't understand... - Why were you so frightened?

392
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,200
到目前為止  沒什麼能說明你為什麼要喝酒
Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter,

393
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,750
還有為什麼允許一個死去的女人被逮捕
and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?

394
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,810
因為還有一點"值得注意"
Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.

395
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,300
她指尖上有一抹血跡
A smear of blood on her finger.

396
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,500
血跡的由來可以有多種解釋
That could have happened any number of ways.

397
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,760
沒錯
Indeed.

398
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,970
還有一點
There's one other thing.

399
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,190
之前並沒有血跡
It wasn't there earlier.

400
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,770
那個也是新的
Neither was that.

401
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,640
你

402
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,920
你
You!

403
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,270
你

404
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,270
你
You?

405
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,850
你

406
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,210
你
You?!

407
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,240
福爾摩斯
Holmes?

408
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,700
吞槍自盡  子彈貫穿頭部...
Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain...

409
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,840
後腦被轟掉
Back of the head blown clean off.

410
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,930
他是怎麼活下來的
How could he survive?

411
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,730
你是說"她"吧
"She", you mean.

412
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,730
什麼
I'm sorry?

413
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,250
不是"他"  是"她"
Not "He", "She".

414
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,220
是啊  當然了
Yes, yes of course.

415
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,720
謝謝你們給我這麼有趣的案子
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.

416
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,560
我破案之後會給你們發電報的  華生
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.

417
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,670
死因不用說是槍傷
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death,

418
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,790
但也明顯有肺癆的跡象
but there are clear indicators of consumption.

419
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,190
還是驗一下屍吧
It might be worth a postmortem.

420
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,170
我們需要所有能收集到的線索
We need all the information we can get.

421
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,300
老爸一走  他就開始顯擺觀察力了
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone

422
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,800
我在某些方面觀察力確實很強
I am observant in some ways,

423
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,460
就像福爾摩斯在某些方面沒有眼力見一樣
just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

424
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,420
- 是嗎  - 沒錯
- Really? - Yes, really.

425
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,420
為了在男人的天下混出頭  也是蠻拼的啊
Amazing...what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.

426
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,100
他這話什麼意思
What's he saying that for?

427
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,400
幹你的活兒去
Get back to work!

428
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,720
說吧  福爾摩斯  你肯定有些想法吧
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?

429
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,970
還沒有
Not yet.

430
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,110
此案水很深  華生  很深
These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.

431
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,620
但我還得繼續深入
And I shall have to go deeper still.

432
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,580
馬車夫說  "是瑞克萊蒂太太"

433
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,400
 西區恐怖殺人案
貴族慘死

434
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,290
伊斯靈頓區可怕發現
小教堂驚現船長屍體

435
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,020
"鬼魂"身份或已確認
馬車夫說  "是瑞克萊蒂太太"

436
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,560
下一個是誰  可怕的"新娘殺人案"

437
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,380
幾個月後  我們才又繼續
It was not for several months that we were to pick up

438
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,720
蘇格蘭場一籌莫展
漢莫斯諾子爵神秘死亡

439
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,960
調查這件奇案
the threads of this strange case again.

440
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,230
還是在出乎意料的情況之下
And then under very unexpected circumstances.

441
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,120
現在已經五起案子了  每起都一樣
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.

442
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,760
請安靜  我在讀至關重要的東西
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.

443
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,700
- 什麼東西  - 黃赤交角
- What is? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

444
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,890
我得讀懂它
I have to understand it.

445
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,610
那是什麼
What is it?

446
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,070
不知道  我還在努力弄懂它
I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

447
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,860
- 我以為你無所不知  - 當然不是了
- I thought you understood everything. - Of course not,

448
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,510
那多浪費我的大腦空間
that would be an appalling waste of brain space.

449
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,610
我是專攻型的
I specialise.

450
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,930
這為什麼那麼重要
And what's so important about this?

451
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,180
五起無聊的謀殺案又怎麼重要了
What's so important about five boring murders?

452
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,760
這可不無聊  五個男人死亡
They're not boring. Five men dead,

453
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,380
在家中遇害  地上灑了生米
murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor

454
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,220
就像在婚禮上一樣
like at a wedding,

455
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,190
牆上用血著"你"
and the word "You" written in blood on the wall!

456
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,030
是她  那個鬼新娘
It's, it's her, it's the Bride.

457
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,140
她又復活了
Somehow she's risen again.

458
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,090
解決了
Solved it.

459
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,590
你怎麼就破案了
You can't have solved it!

460
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,460
我當然破了  非常簡單
Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.

461
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,180
神秘的瑞克萊蒂太太事件
The incident of the mysterious Mrs Ricoletti,

462
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,460
這位來自陰間的兇手
the killer from beyond the grave,

463
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,270
被媒體大肆渲染
has been widely reported in the popular press.

464
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,600
現在有人將自己實施的謀殺
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders

465
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,870
偽裝成是鬼魂殺人
as the work of a ghost,

466
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,910
以此迷惑愚蠢至極的蘇格蘭場
to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

467
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,210
瞧  我破案了
There you are, solved.

468
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,980
你走前跟赫德森太太聊聊
Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out,

469
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,600
她喜歡有參與感
she likes to feel involved.

470
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,750
你確定
You sure?

471
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,460
確定  你走吧
Certainly. Go away.

472
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,370
華生  我準備好了
Watson! I'm ready.

473
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,880
戴好帽子穿好鞋  我們有個重要約會
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.

474
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,820
華生醫生幾個月前不是搬走了嗎
Didn't Dr Watson move out a few months ago?

475
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,070
確實是這樣  是吧
He did, didn't he?

476
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,730
那我一直是在跟誰說話來著
Who have I been talking to all this time?

477
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,360
我代表愚蠢至極的蘇格蘭場說一句
Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

478
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,150
那張椅子上沒人
that chair is definitely empty.

479
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,880
確實沒人啊
It is, isn't it?

480
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,630
但我這些日子過得還挺不錯
Works surprisingly well, though.

481
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,570
我還以為他有進步了
I actually thought he was improving.

482
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,620
你去哪了
Where have you been?

483
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,490
抱歉  老爺  我今早有些遲了
Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.

484
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,590
你連蛋都不會煮嗎
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?!

485
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,160
爐裡沒有火  到處是灰塵
The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere

486
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,120
你清理我靴子上的泥時差點毀了那雙鞋
and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.

487
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,430
如果不是我妻子掌管傭人的事
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff,

488
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,610
我會親自管教你
I would talk to you myself.

489
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,850
我妻子人呢
Where is my wife?

490
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,880
很抱歉  老爺  夫人出去了
Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

491
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,300
這麼早就出門了嗎
Out? At this hour of the morning?

492
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,410
是  老爺  您不知道嗎  老爺
Yes, sir. Did you not know that, sir?

493
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,670
她去哪了  她最近總出去
Where did she go? She's always out these days.

494
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,260
您不也是  老爺
Not unlike yourself...sir.

495
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,430
什麼
I'm sorry...?

496
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,840
- 就是說說我的觀察  老爺  - 夠了
- Just observing, sir. - Well, that's quite enough,

497
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,090
誰讓你觀察的
nobody asked you to be observant.

498
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,010
抱歉  老爺  我就是說
Sorry, sir, I just meant

499
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,120
你們很少一起待在家裡了  老爺
you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.

500
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,610
你的言行近乎無禮
You are dangerously close to impertinence.

501
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,180
我會跟我妻子談談  讓她管教下你
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.

502
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,240
好的  老爺  那您什麼時候見她呢
Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?

503
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,510
- 聽著...  - 我差點忘了  老爺
- Now, listen... - Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.

504
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,730
- 有封您的電報  - 你忘了
- A telegram came for you. - You forgot?!

505
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,250
沒有  只是差點忘了
No, I nearly forgot.

506
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,710
你一早上都在幹什麼
What have you been doing all morning?

507
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,910
讀您《斯特蘭德月刊》上的新文章  老爺
Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.

508
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,020
你喜歡嗎
Did you enjoy it?

509
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,730
您為什麼從不提我  老爺
Why do you never mention me, sir?

510
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,620
下去吧
Go away.

511
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,270
約翰·華生醫生

512
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,760
如方便  速來，如不方便  也速來
福爾摩斯

513
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,370
- 什麼的什麼  - 黃赤交角
- The what of the what? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

514
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,850
你說"速來"  我以為是很重要的事
"Come at once," You said. I assumed it was important.

515
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,520
是很重要  那是地球的赤道面
It is. It's the inclination of the earth's equator

516
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,970
與其繞太陽運行的軌道平面的夾角
to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.

517
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,790
你是剛學的吧
You been swotting up?

518
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,200
- 我為什麼要那麼做  - 為了顯得聰明
- Why would I do that? - To sound clever.

519
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,510
- 我本就聰明  - 我懂了
- I am clever. - Oh, oh, I see.

520
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,850
懂什麼了
You see what?

521
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,440
我推理我們是要去見某個比你聰明的人
I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

522
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
閉嘴
Shut up.

523
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,580
第歐根尼俱樂部

524
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:08,770
保持絕對安靜

525
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,890
早上好  懷爾德

526
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,060
我哥哥在嗎

527
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,430
當然  先生

528
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,430
現在是早餐時間

529
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,100
在貴客間

530
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,640
是的  先生

531
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,350
這位先生是我的客人

532
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,850
是啊

533
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,850
是華生醫生吧

534
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,850
很喜歡您寫的《藍寶石奇案》  先生

535
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,770
謝謝  很高興你喜歡

536
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,640
你很  醜

537
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,470
您說什麼

538
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,930
醜  你剛才說到《藍色的魚販》

539
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,930
非常醜

540
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,890
很高興你喜歡我的土豆

541
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,430
是的  你得多練練  華生

542
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,430
你在跳舞課上太下功夫了

543
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,600
什麼
Sorry, what?

544
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,790
對想研究人類的人來說  這裡最合適
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.

545
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,760
也很方便  畢竟你那不斷擴張的屁股
Handy really, as your ever-expanding backside

546
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,050
永遠粘在了這裡
is permanently glued to it.

547
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,060
早上好  我的哥哥
Good morning, brother mine.

548
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,390
夏洛克  華生醫生
Sherlock. Dr Watson.

549
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,250
您看上去  很不錯  先生
You look...well, sir.

550
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,850
真的嗎  我覺得我看上去很巨大
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.

551
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,800
既然您提到了  這種程度的暴飲暴食
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption

552
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,440
對您的健康危害極大
is incredibly injurious to your health.

553
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,580
- 您的心臟  - 不用擔心那個  華生
- Your heart... - No need to worry on that score, Watson.

554
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,020
- 不嗎  - 該裝那個器官的地方
- No? - There's only a large cavity

555
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,650
只有一個大大的空腔
where that organ should reside.

556
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,610
- 家族通病  - 我沒有指責你的意思
- It's a family trait. - Oh, I wasn't being critical.

557
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,890
如果您繼續這樣  先生
If you continue like this, sir,

558
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,140
我覺得您最多能活五年
I give you five years at the most.

559
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,340
五年  我們推測也就三年  對吧  夏洛克
Five? We thought three, did we not, Sherlock?

560
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,520
我還是傾向於四年
I'm still inclined to four.

561
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,320
你總是這樣  只會看  卻不懂觀察
As ever, you see but you do not observe.

562
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,250
注意我眼白的顏色發生了變化
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes,

563
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,660
角膜周圍出現可見的脂肪圈
the visible rings of fat around the corneas.

564
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,970
你說得對  我改賭三年
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years,

565
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,630
- 四個月零十一天  - 打賭
- four months and 11 days. - A bet?!

566
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,350
我理解你不贊同  華生
I understand your disapproval, Watson,

567
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,630
但他好勝心切
but if he's feeling competitive,

568
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,760
完全可以控制自己早點死亡
it's perfectly within his power to die early.

569
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,550
這是你必須冒的險
That's a risk you'll have to take.

570
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,380
你在拿自己的性命打賭
You're gambling with your own life?

571
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,520
為什麼不呢  比拿別人的命打賭有意思多了
Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.

572
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,530
整三年  如果你吃了那個葡萄乾布丁的話
Three years flat - if you eat that plum pudding!

573
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,110
就這麼定了
Done.

574
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,450
我以為幾天前會因為領主宅邸的案子見到你呢
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.

575
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,540
我覺得那案子你會有點力不從心
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.

576
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,020
沒有  我解決了
No. I solved it.

577
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,620
- 肯定是亞當斯  - 是亞當斯
- It was Adams, of course. - Yes, it was Adams.

578
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,180
嫉妒殺人
Murderous jealousy.

579
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,760
他給皇家天文學會寫了一篇
He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society

580
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,020
關於黃赤交角的論文
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

581
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,170
然後又讀到另一篇
and then read another

582
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,840
比他寫的好的
that seemed to surpass it.

583
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
我知道  我讀了
I know, I read it.

584
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,170
你看明白了嗎
Did you understand it?

585
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,640
當然  很淺顯易懂
Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.

586
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,140
不是  你明白嫉妒殺人嗎
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy?

587
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,490
一個偉大的頭腦
It is no easy thing

588
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,840
去思忖一個更偉大的頭腦可不容易
for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.

589
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,880
你召我來就是為了羞辱我嗎
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?

590
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,050
是的
Yes.

591
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,760
當然不是  但這是最大的樂趣
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.

592
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,410
那你能不能解釋下為什麼要召...
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon...?

593
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,720
我們的生活方式被一個無形敵人所威脅
Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.

594
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,960
他們每天都常伴我們身邊
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.

595
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,010
這些敵人無處不在
These enemies are everywhere...

596
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,000
無人發現
undetected...

597
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,730
無法阻止
and unstoppable.

598
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,150
社會主義者嗎

不是社會主義者  醫生  不是
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

600
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,110
- 無政府主義者  - 不是
- Anarchists? - No.

601
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,570
法國人  婦女參政權論者
The French? The suffragists?

602
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,490
有哪個大規模團體不讓你擔心嗎
Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about?

603
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,570
華生醫生永遠心懷警惕  詳說
Dr Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate...

604

不  去調查

605
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,720
這是我的推測  我需要你去證實
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.

606
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,370
我要給你個案子
I'm sending you a case.

607
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,460
- 蘇格蘭人  - 蘇格蘭人
- The Scots? - The Scots?!

608
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,560
你是否瞭解最近
Are you aware of recent theories concerning

609
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,050
關於妄想症的理論
what is known as paranoia?

610
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,740
聽著像是塞爾維亞人
Oh, sounds Serbian.

611
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,780
會有位女士去找你  卡邁克夫人
A woman will call on you. Lady Carmichael.

612
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,210
你得接她的案子
I want you to take her case.

613
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,200
但這些敵人  如果你不告訴我們
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them

614
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,630
我們要怎麼打敗他們
if you won't tell us about them?

615
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,540
我們不會打敗他們
We don't defeat them.

616
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,700
我們絕對要輸給他們
We most certainly lose to them.

617
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,240
為什麼
Why?

618
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,950
因為他們是正確的  我們是錯的
Because they are right. And we are wrong.

619
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,110
卡邁克夫人的案子  是什麼
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

620
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,740
放心  會有值得你注意的地方
Rest assured, it has features of interest.

621
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,090
- 我從沒那麼說過  - 你真說過
- I never really say that. - You really do.

622
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,740
我估計你已經解開了
And you've solved it already, I assume?

623
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,030
只是設想而已  我需要你去跑腿
Only in my head. I need you for the, er, legwork.

624
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,890
為什麼不告訴我們你的答案
Why not just tell us your solution?

625
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,800
那還有什麼意思呢
And where would be the sport in that?

626
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,340
你願意接嗎  夏洛克
Will you do it, Sherlock?

627
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,020
這絕對是極好的消遣
I can promise you a superior distraction.

628
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,600
我有一個條件  你再吃一個葡萄乾布丁
On one condition. Have another plum pudding.

629
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,930
本來就準備吃了
There's one on the way.

630
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,620
兩年十一個月四天
Two years, 11 months and four days.

631
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,260
開始好玩嘍  滴答  滴答  滴答
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

632
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,000
謝謝  懷爾德
Thank you, Wilder.

633
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,100
有一位梅勒斯先生要見您  福爾摩斯先生
Also, a Mr Melas to see you, Mr Holmes.

634
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,440
等我五分鐘  我還有一場賭局要贏呢
Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.

635
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,040
還是十五分鐘吧
Better make that 15.

636
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,910
滴答
Ticktock.

637
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,310
福爾摩斯先生  我是來請您出主意的
Mr Holmes, I have come here for advice.

638
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,660
- 這個不難  - 還要請您幫忙
- That is easily got. - And help.

639
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,190
這就未必容易了
Not always so easy.

640
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,980
有古怪的事發生了  福爾摩斯先生
Something has happened, Mr Holmes, something...unusual

641
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,650
而且很可怕
and...terrifying.

642
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,000
那您真是太走運了
Then you are in luck.

643
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
走運嗎
Luck?!

644
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,010
那是我的專長  看來真的很有趣啊
Those are my specialisms. This is really very promising.

645
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,150
福爾摩斯...
Holmes...

646
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,970
請說說  您究竟在擔憂什麼
Please...do tell us what has so distressed you.

647
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,690
我想了很久該怎麼辦
I, I thought long and hard as to what to do,

648
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,720
後來突然想起  我丈夫
but then it occurred to me that my husband was

649
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,720
是您哥哥相識  也許通過他...
an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him...

650
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,630
其實我也不確定
The fact is, I'm not sure

651
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,240
這事是否該找您  福爾摩斯先生
this comes within your purview, Mr Holmes.

652
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,040
是嗎
No?

653
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,990
天啊  這或許是驅魔牧師的事
Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.

654
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,990
你的晨間危機是什麼  親愛的
And what does your morning threaten, my dear?

655
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,140
繡花繡得停不下來
A vigorous round of embroidering?

656
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,050
還是在女帽店挑花了眼
An exhausting appointment at the milliners?

657
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,220
你就愛說笑  尤斯塔斯
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

658
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,620
怎麼了
What is it?

659
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

660
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,110
丹尼爾  索菲  出去玩會兒
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

661
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,820
媽媽...
But, Mama...

662
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,530
聽話  快去
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

663
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,990
尤斯塔斯  這是什麼意思
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

664
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,260
死亡
Death.

665
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,810
什麼
What?

666
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,990
這意味著死亡
It means death.

667
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,660
沒什麼  沒什麼
Er, nothing, it's, it's nothing.

668
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,120
我弄錯了
I was...mistaken.

669
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,370
親愛的  你的臉色怎麼這麼蒼白
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

670
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,670
沒事的
It's nothing!

671
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,700
尤斯塔斯
Eustace...

672
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,180
信封您還留著嗎
Did you keep the envelope?

673
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,370
被我丈夫毀了  但上面什麼也沒有
My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.

674
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,100
沒有姓名  位址  任何資訊
No name or address of any kind.

675
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,260
尤斯塔斯爵士在美國待過嗎
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?

676
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,590
- 沒有  - 你們結婚前也沒有嗎
- No. - Not even before your marriage?

677
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,140
據我所知沒有
Well, not to my knowledge.

678
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,850
請您繼續往下說吧
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.

679
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,710
這是上週一早上的事
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.

680
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,900
兩天后的週三
It was two days later on the Wednesday

681
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,740
我丈夫第一次看見了她
that my husband first saw her.

682
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,690
誰
Who?

683
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,740
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

684
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,800
她來找我了  路易莎
She's come for me, Louisa!

685
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,310
天啊  幫幫我  我的罪孽找上門了
Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out!

686
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,260
誰來找你了  尤斯塔斯  你嚇到我了
Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.

687
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,480
看啊  看啊
Well, look, look!

688
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,870
你沒看見嗎
Don't you see her?

689
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,370
我誰也沒看見
No, I see no-one.

690
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,130
不見了
Gone.

691
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,550
你對我隱瞞了那麼多秘密  這又是一個嗎
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another?

692
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,070
你看到了誰
Who have you seen?

693
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,990
是她
It was her!

694
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,980
是鬼新娘
It was the Bride!

695
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,150
而您什麼也沒看見
And you saw nothing?

696
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,250
是的
Nothing.

697
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,350
- 您丈夫描述過...  - 沒有  直到今早
- Did your husband describe...? - Nothing, until this morning.

698
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,780
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

699
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,470
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

700
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,380
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

701
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,280
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

702
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,500
該死
Blast!

703
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,770
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

704
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,360
你在哪  是我
Where are you? It's me!

705
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,750
*別忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

706
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,380
*別忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

707
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,420
*記住那少女*
*Remember the maid*

708
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,090
*磨坊的少女*
*The maid of the mill*

709
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,630
你是誰
Who are you?

710
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,450
我命令你  報上姓名
I demand you speak, who are you?!

711
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,940
尤斯塔斯  跟我說說話  老天啊
Eustace, speak to me. In the name of God!

712
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,790
她是...
She's...

713
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,990
她是艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

714
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,450
不  不是你
No, not you.

715
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,800
不
No...

716
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,250
求你了
Please!

717
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,140
今晚  尤斯塔斯·卡邁克
This night, Eustace Carmichael,

718
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,070
你將必死
you will die!

719
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,440
- 福爾摩斯  - 別說話  華生
- Holmes? - Hush, Watson.

720
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,690
是艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂  鬼新娘
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

721
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,880
- 您知道她  - 請原諒華生
- Well, you know the name? - You must forgive Watson,

722
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,420
他就喜歡說出一些顯而易見的事實
he has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious,

723
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,510
近乎狂熱
which borders on mania.

724
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,530
容我問一句  您丈夫今早怎麼樣
May I ask, how is your husband this morning?

725
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,540
他不肯談這件事
He refuses to speak about the matter.

726
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,900
當然了  我敦促他離開家
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.

727
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
不不  他得待在家裡
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

728
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,940
您不認為他有生命危險嗎
Well, you don't think he's in danger?

729
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,750
當然有  絕對有人想要他的命
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to kill him,

730
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,470
但這對我們是好事  沒有餌就釣不到魚
but that's good for us. You can't set a trap without bait.

731
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,870
我丈夫可不是誘餌  福爾摩斯先生
My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes.

732
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,490
如果我們做對了  他就能做誘餌
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

733
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,020
聽著  您現在立刻回家
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.

734
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,880
華生醫生和我會乘下一班火車跟上
Dr. Watson and I will follow on the next train.

735
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,920
一刻也不能耽擱了
There's not a moment to lose,

736
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,470
尤斯塔斯爵士今晚就要死了
Sir Eustace is to die tonight.

737
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,020
福爾摩斯
Holmes.

738
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,580
我們也許該阻止此事
And we should...probably avoid that.

739
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,170
- 一定要  - 一定要阻止
- Definitely. - Definitely avoid that.

740
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,920
我弟弟接了這案子  不出所料
Little brother has taken the case, of course.

741
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,410
那就拜託你留意情況了
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things,

742
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,790
但絕不能讓他懷疑你在幫我
but he must never suspect you are working for me.

743
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,090
清楚了嗎  華生
Are you clear on that, Watson?

744
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,830
你可以相信我  福爾摩斯先生
You can rely on me, Mr Holmes.

745
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,370
- 你說會不會...  - 不會
- You don't suppose... - No, I don't

746
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,250
你也不該這麼想
and neither should you.

747
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,590
你又不知道我要說什麼
You don't know what I was going to say.

748
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,920
你是想說  可能有什麼超自然的東西
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency

749
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,650
牽扯其中  而我打算當面嘲笑你
involved in this matter. And I was about to laugh in your face.

750
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,980
可那個鬼新娘  福爾摩斯
But the Bride, Holmes,

751
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,710
又是艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
Emelia Ricoletti again.

752
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,460
一個死去的女人活過來了
A dead woman walking the earth.

753
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,340
- 你真讓我驚訝  華生  - 是嗎
- You amaze me, Watson. - I do?

754
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,890
你什麼時候開始有想像力了
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?

755
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,740
或許是從我讓讀者相信
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that

756
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,340
某個不道德的吸毒者是個紳士英雄開始
an unprincipled drug addict was some kind of gentleman hero.

757
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,300
是啊  說到這個  還真是了不起
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.

758
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,600
但你可以放心  這世上沒有鬼
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.

759
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,660
除了我們自己想像的
Save those we make for ourselves.

760
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,970
抱歉  你說什麼
Sorry, what did you say?

761
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,520
我們自己想像的鬼  什麼意思
Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean?

762
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,710
夢遊症
Somnambulism.

763
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,440
抱歉  什麼
I beg your pardon?

764
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,380
我會夢遊  就這樣
I sleepwalk, that's all.

765
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,000
這再常見不過了
It's a common enough condition.

766
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,390
你不是醫生嗎
I thought you were a doctor!

767
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,580
這整件事就是一場噩夢
The whole thing was a...bad dream.

768
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,420
包括你收到的信封裡的東西嗎
Including the contents of the envelope you received?

769
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,090
那是個古怪的玩笑
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

770
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,320
你在你妻子面前的表現可並非如此  先生
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.

771
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,060
- 她有癔病  會妄想  - 不
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies. - No.

772
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,730
不好意思  你說什麼
I'm sorry, what did you say?

773
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,710
我說不  她沒有癔病
I said no, she's not an hysteric.

774
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,120
她是個非常聰明的女人  有少見的洞察力
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.

775
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,200
我妻子從桔核裡看出了恐懼
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.

776
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,240
你妻子能在旁人看不見任何價值的地方
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see

777
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,030
看出很多東西
anything of value whatsoever.

778
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,450
真的嗎
Can she really?

779
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,780
那你是如何"推理"出來的呢  福爾摩斯先生
And how do you "deduce" that, Mr Holmes?

780
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,210
她嫁給了你
She married you.

781
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,330
她一定是找到了什麼合理的理由
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.

782
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,920
今晚我會盡力保護你的安全
I'll do my best to save your life tonight,

783
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,830
但如果你能解釋一下
but first it would help

784
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,500
你和瑞克萊蒂一案的關係  會大有幫助
if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.

785
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,550
瑞克萊蒂
Ricoletti?

786
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,870
是的  拜託具體些
Yes. In detail, please.

787
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,990
我從沒聽說過她
I've never heard of her.

788
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,190
有意思  我沒說瑞克萊蒂是個女人
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman.

789
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,240
我們告辭了  希望明早能再見到你
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.

790
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,950
你不會了
You will not.

791
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,690
那很不幸  我就得破你的謀殺案了  日安
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.

792
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,050
你盡力了
Well, you tried.

793
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,100
請把這個交給卡邁克夫人  謝謝
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this. Thank you.

794
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,250
- 再見  - 沒問題  先生
- Good afternoon. - Certainly, sir.

795
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,660
那是什麼
What was that?

796
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,090
卡邁克夫人今晚要單獨睡
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight,

797
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,670
假裝頭痛難忍
upon the pretence of a violent headache.

798
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,790
整個宅子的門窗都要緊鎖
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.

799
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,820
你覺得那幽靈  鬼新娘
You think the spectre, er, Bride,

800
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,840
會試圖再次把尤斯塔斯爵士引到外面嗎
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?

801
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,380
當然了  否則為什麼放出威脅
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat?

802
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,880
"今晚  你將必死"
"This night you will die!"

803
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,630
但他不會跟她去吧
Well, he won't follow her, surely?

804
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,540
他會怎麼做  很難說
Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.

805
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,380
愧疚在吞噬他的靈魂
Guilt is eating away at his soul.

806
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
愧疚  關於什麼
Guilt? About what?

807
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,100
他過去的某件事  那些桔核是一個提醒
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.

808
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,920
- 不是玩笑嗎  - 完全不是
- Not a joke? - Not at all.

809
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,600
桔核是傳統的償命預警
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death,

810
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,960
起源於美國
originating in America.

811
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,770
尤斯塔斯爵士對此再瞭解不過了
Sir Eustace knows this only too well,

812
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,550
他也很清楚自己為什麼要遭懲罰
just as he knows why he is to be punished.

813
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,770
和艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂有關嗎
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti?

814
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,640
我想是的
I presume.

815
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,960
我們都有過去  華生  有"鬼"
We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

816
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,570
那是決定我們每個晴天的陰影
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

817
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,180
尤斯塔斯爵士知道自己逃不過了
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

818
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,630
他恐懼的不僅僅是死亡
There's something more than murder he fears.

819
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,420
他認為死去的瑞克萊蒂太太復活的屍體
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse

820
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,230
要把他拖進地獄
of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

821
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,760
這太荒謬了  不是嗎
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

822
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,730
是啊  你的左輪手槍帶了嗎
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?

823
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,240
手槍在幽靈面前有什麼用
What good would that be against a ghost?

824
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,020
- 對極了  你帶了嗎  - 當然了
- Exactly. Did you bring it? - Yeah, of course.

825
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,840
那就來吧  華生  來吧
Then come, Watson, come.

826
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,700
遊戲開始了
The game is afoot.

827
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,560
- 蹲下  華生  真是的  - 抱歉  抽筋了
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake! - Sorry. Cramp.

828
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,490
- 燈還亮著嗎  - 是的
- Is the lamp still burning? - Yes.

829
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,440
尤斯塔斯爵士的燈滅了
There goes Sir Eustace.

830
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,190
卡邁克夫人的也滅了
And Lady Carmichael.

831
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,130
宅子睡下了
The house sleeps.

832
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,490
老天  這是我這輩子最漫長的一夜了
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.

833
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,470
耐心點  華生
Have patience, Watson.

834
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,770
才到午夜
Only midnight.

835
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,240
我們很少這樣坐在一起
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.

836
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,120
那樣最好  膝蓋要疼死了
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.

837
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,260
兩個老朋友說著話  聊著天
Two old friends just talking. Chewing the fat.

838
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,660
男人對男人
Man-to-man.

839
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,570
非凡的女人
So, a remarkable woman.

840
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,540
- 誰  - 卡邁克夫人
- Who? - Lady Carmichael.

841
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,560
女性是你的專長  華生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

842
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,670
你說什麼就是什麼
I'll take your word for it.

843
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,180
你挺喜歡她的  說她"有少見的洞察力"
Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

844
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,870
和令人讚歎的高足弓
And admirably high arches.

845
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,720
她一進房間  我就注意到了
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.

846
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,050
- 她太好了  他配不上  - 你這麼認為嗎
- Huh, she's far too good for him. - You think so?

847
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,760
不  是你這麼認為  我看得出來
No. You think so. I could tell.

848
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,870
恰恰相反  我對此毫無看法
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.

849
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,010
不  你有
Yes, you have.

850
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,720
婚姻不是我會思考的問題
Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.

851
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,550
- 為什麼  - 你今晚是怎麼回事
- Oh, why not? - What's the matter with you this evening?

852
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,070
你戴的那塊表  裡面有張照片
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.

853
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,800
我瞥過一眼  是愛琳·阿德勒吧
I glimpsed it once. I believe it is of Irene Adler.

854
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,930
你不只是瞥了一眼  你是等我睡著了
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep

855
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,910
- 才拿去看的  - 是這樣沒錯
- and looked at it. - Yes, I did.

856
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,700
- 你真以為我不會發現嗎  - 愛琳·阿德勒
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice? - Irene Adler.

857
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,100
一位強大的對手  一次了不起的冒險
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.

858
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,160
- 一張漂亮的照片  - 你為什麼要談這些
- A very nice photograph. - Why are you talking like this?

859
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,700
你為什麼堅決要孑然一身
Why are you so determined to be alone?

860
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,990
你沒事吧  華生
Are you quite well, Watson?

861
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,390
這問題就這麼奇怪嗎
Is it such a curious question?

862
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,840
對於一個維也納精神病醫生來說  不奇怪
From a Viennese alienist, no.

863
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,840
{\pos(182,252)}指佛洛德

864
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,330
對於退役軍醫來說  當然奇怪
From a retired army surgeon, most certainly.

865
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,260
福爾摩斯  我是毫無競爭對手的
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever,

866
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,090
- 你最親密的朋友  - 我承認
- I am your closest friend. - I concede it.

867
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,710
我現在是想和你
I am currently attempting to have

868
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:23,150
談些再正常不過的事
a perfectly normal conversation with you.

869
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,260
別這樣
Please don't.

870
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,970
你為什麼非要孑然一身
Why do you need to be alone?

871
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,340
如果你指的是感情糾葛  華生
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson,

872
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,120
恐怕你就是  正如我以前常說的
which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before,

873
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,330
我憎惡一切感情
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

874
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,260
感情是干擾靈敏儀器的沙粒
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.

875
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,600
- 鏡片上的裂紋  - 鏡片上的裂紋  對
- The crack in the lens. - The crack in the lens. Yes.

876
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,850
這就是了
Well, there you are, you see,

877
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,020
- 我之前都說過  - 不  這都是我寫的
- I've said it all before. - No, I wrote all that.

878
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,120
你在援引《斯特蘭德月刊》中你自己的話
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.

879
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,980
就是啊
Well, exactly.

880
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,630
那些是我的話  不是你的
Those are my words, not yours!

881
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,920
那是我向公眾展示的你
That is the version of you that I present to the public.

882
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,490
沒有感情的頭腦  電腦器
The brain without a heart. The calculating machine.

883
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,470
那些都是我寫的  福爾摩斯
I write all of that, Holmes,

884
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,090
讀者們也欣然接受  但我不相信
and the readers lap it up. But I do not believe it.

885
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,450
我非常想給你的編輯寫信
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.

886
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,030
你是一個活生生的人
You are a living, breathing man.

887
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,800
- 你也有生活  也有過去  - 有什麼
- You've lived a life, you have a past. - A what?!

888
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,760
- 你肯定有過...  - 有什麼
- Well, you must have had... - Had what?

889
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,370
- 你懂的  - 不懂
- You know. - No.

890
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,480
經歷
Experiences.

891
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,190
把左輪手槍遞給我  我突然需要用一下
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.

892
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,060
見鬼  福爾摩斯  你也是血肉之軀
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood,

893
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,000
也有感情  你有...
you have feelings, you have...

894
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,300
你肯定有...衝動
You must have... impulses.

895
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,030
天啊  我從未如此盼望
Dear Lord, I have never been so impatient

896
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,880
被殺人不眨眼的鬼魂攻擊
to be attacked by a murderous ghost.

897
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,180
作為你的朋友  作為擔心你的人
As your friend, as someone who worries about you...

898
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,430
是什麼讓你變成這樣的
What made you like this?

899
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,000
華生...
Oh, Watson...

900
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,840
沒什麼塑造了我
Nothing made me.

901
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,560
我塑造了自己
I made me.

902
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,510
紅鬍子
Redbeard?

903
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,470
我的天啊
Good God!

904
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,390
我們該怎麼辦
What are we to do?

905
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,400
我們去跟她聊聊吧
Why don't we have a chat?

906
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,560
是瑞克萊蒂太太吧
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe!

907
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,710
就這個時節來說  今晚真是宜人
A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?

908
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,900
這不可能  福爾摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

909
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,980
是不可能
No, it can't.

910
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,150
- 鎖上了  - 按照要求鎖著
- Is it locked? - As per instruction.

911
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,510
那是打破窗戶的聲音  是嗎
That was a window breaking, wasn't it?

912
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,820
我們只需要擔心一扇打破的窗戶
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.

913
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,240
- 待在這兒  華生  - 什麼  不
- Stay here, Watson. - What? No.

914
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,200
所有進出房子的門窗都鎖著
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.

915
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,170
這是他們唯一的出口  我需要你在這兒守著
This is their only way out, I need you here!

916
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,200
但那聲音很接近
But the sound was so close.

917
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,490
- 肯定是從房子這一側傳來的  - 守在這兒
- It had to be from this side of the house. - Stay here!

918
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,980
不
No!

919
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,070
你答應過保護他安全的  你答應過的
You promised to keep him safe. You promised!

920
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,260
你...
You...

921
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,680
你是人  這我知道
You're human, I know that.

922
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,230
你肯定是
You must be.

923
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:06,660
我們這樣站在黑暗中也沒什麼用
Little use us standing here in the dark.

924
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,710
畢竟  這是十九世紀
After all, this is the 19th century.

925
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,300
別忘了我
Do not forget me!

926
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,880
別忘了我
Do not forget me!

927
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,090
- 華生  - 她在那兒  她就在那邊
- Watson! - She's there! She's down there!

928
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,540
別告訴我你擅離職守了
Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

929
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,470
什麼  福爾摩斯  她在那兒  我看見她了
What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her!

930
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,350
沒人了  都怪你
Empty, thanks to you!

931
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,560
煮熟的鴨子飛了
Our bird is flown!

932
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,230
不  福爾摩斯  不是你想的那樣
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.

933
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,640
我看見她了  那鬼魂
I saw her! The ghost!

934
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,180
根本沒有鬼魂
There are no ghosts!

935
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,890
發生什麼了  尤斯塔斯爵士在哪
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

936
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,270
死了
Dead.

937
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,010
你不能怪自己
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.

938
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,600
是  你說得對
No, you're quite right.

939
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,590
很高興你明白過來了
I'm glad you're seeing sense.

940
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,900
華生也應該受譴責
Watson is equally culpable.

941
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,370
我們搞砸了整個案子
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.

942
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,200
我做出承諾  要保護那個人
I gave an undertaking to protect that man,

943
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,040
結果他現在胸口插著匕首  倒在那裡
now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.

944
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,650
其實  你承諾的是調查他的謀殺案
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.

945
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,980
滿懷沒這個必要的自信
In the confident expectation I would not have to!

946
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,310
你能告訴我們什麼嗎  醫生
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

947
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,730
兇手刺殺他的力度可不小
Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.

948
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,050
這麼說  是男性
It's a man, then?

949
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,050
可能是
Possibly.

950
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,020
刀刃非常鋒利  所以也可能是女性
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman?

951
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,130
從理論上說  是的
In theory, yes,

952
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,840
但我們知道是誰  我看見她了
but we know who it was, I saw her.

953
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,910
- 華生  - 我看見鬼魂了  親眼所見
- Watson! - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

954
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,040
你什麼也沒看見  你看到了別人做的戲
You saw nothing! You saw what you were supposed to see!

955
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,960
你自己說過的  我沒有想像力
You said yourself, I have no imagination.

956
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,120
那就動動腦  去掉不可能的解釋
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible,

957
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,530
在這樁案子中就是鬼魂
which in this case is the ghost,

958
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,870
並觀察餘下的  那就是答案
and observe what remains, which in this case is a solution

959
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,510
如此明顯  連雷斯垂德也能想明白
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!

960
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,430
謝謝
Thank you!

961
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,520
別去想什麼來自冥界的幽靈了
Forget spectres from the other world!

962
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,670
只有一個嫌疑人有作案動機和機會
There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.

963
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,990
簡直無異於留了字條
They might as well have left a note.

964
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,240
兇手確實留了字條
They did leave a note.

965
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,390
然後還有另一扇破窗的問題
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.

966
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,310
- 什麼另一扇破窗  - 就是啊  根本沒有
- What other broken window? - Precisely! There isn't one.

967
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,450
整棟房子唯一一扇破窗
The only broken window in this establishment

968
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,950
就是我和華生進來的那扇
is the one that Watson and I entered through,

969
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,090
但在那之前  我們清楚地聽見了聲音...
yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...

970
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,790
- 你剛才說什麼  - 你說什麼
- What did you just say? - Sorry?

971
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,000
關於字條  你剛才說什麼
About a note, what did you just say?

972
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,770
- 我說兇手確實留下了字條  - 不  沒有
- I said the murderer DID leave a note. - No, they didn't.

973
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,730
匕首上系了張字條  你肯定看見了
There's a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!

974
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,880
- 沒有什麼字條  - 有的
- There's no message. - Yes!

975
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,730
我發現屍體的時候上面沒有字條
There was no message when I found the body.

976
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,790
福爾摩斯
Holmes?

977
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:31,990
上面寫了什麼
What is it?

978
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,060
想我了嗎

979
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,630
你想嗎
Do you?

980
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,620
我想什麼
Do I what?

981
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,970
想我了嗎

982
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
你怎麼拿到這個的
H-how did you get that?

983
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,070
我把它留在犯罪現場了
I left it at the crime scene.

984
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,800
犯罪現場
"Crime scene"?

985
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,880
你從哪學來的這些詞彙
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

986
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,280
你想他嗎
Do you miss him?

987
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,200
莫里亞蒂已經死了
Moriarty is dead.

988
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,650
但是
And yet...?

989
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,380
我們沒找到他的屍體
His body was never recovered.

990
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,920
一個被推下瀑布的數學教授是該找不到
To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.

991
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,270
純粹理性被驚險的情節推翻
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.

992
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,910
一句話概括了你的生活
Your life in a nutshell.

993
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,080
你從哪學來的這些詞彙
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

994
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,050
你又胖了嗎
Have you put on weight?

995
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,570
你昨天才見過我  你覺得可能嗎
You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?

996
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,670
不可能
No.

997
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,710
但我的確又胖了
Yet here I am, increased.

998
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,890
全英格蘭
What does that tell

999
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,670
最好的犯罪調查專家能從中悟到什麼
the foremost criminal investigator in England?

1000
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,650
全英格蘭
In England?

1001
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,840
你陷得很深  夏洛克
You're in deep, Sherlock,

1002
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,870
比你預想的要深得多
deeper than you ever intended to be.

1003
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,190
- 你列清單了嗎  - 列什麼
- Have you made a list? - Of what?

1004
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,930
所有的  我們會需要張清單
Everything. We will need a list.

1005
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,310
好樣的
Good boy.

1006
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,120
不  我還沒完事
No, I haven't finished yet.

1007
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,630
莫里亞蒂可能不敢苟同
Moriarty may beg to differ.

1008
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,560
他想讓我分心  轉移我的視線
He's trying to distract me. To derail me.

1009
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,130
沒錯  他是鏡片上的裂紋  藥膏裡的蒼蠅
Yes. He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment,

1010
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,340
資料裡的病毒
the virus in the data.

1011
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,660
我必須完成
I have to finish this.

1012
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,550
如果莫里亞蒂真從萊辛巴赫的海釜裡爬了出來
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron,

1013
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,690
他會找到你的
he will seek you out.

1014
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,060
那我等著他
I'll be waiting.

1015
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,550
是啊
Yes.

1016
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,290
恐怕你會的
I'm very much afraid you will.

1017
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,720
尤斯塔斯·卡邁克之死

1018
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,220
馬車夫說  "是瑞克萊蒂太太"

1019
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,100
又一位憤怒的新娘

1020
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,810
輝煌一生最終慘死

1021
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,810
漢莫斯諾子爵死亡

1022
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,810
顯赫貴族慘遭襲擊

1023
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,810
蘇格蘭場一籌莫展

1024
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,390
下一個是誰

1025
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,790
他已經這樣兩天了
Two days he's been like that.

1026
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,470
他吃東西了嗎
Has he eaten?

1027
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,420
沒有  一口都沒吃
No, not a morsel.

1028
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,670
媒體都樂瘋了
Press are having a ruddy field day.

1029
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,150
外面還有記者蹲守
There's still reporters outside.

1030
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,720
他們一直在那裡  我趕不走他們
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.

1031
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,230
我一直忙著給他們泡茶
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.

1032
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,050
你為什麼要給他們泡茶
Why do you make them tea?

1033
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,900
我不知道  我就那麼做了
I dunno, I just sort of do.

1034
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,370
他說"只有一個嫌疑人"  然後就走了
He said, "There's only one suspect," and then he just walks away

1035
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,420
現在又不肯解釋
and now he won't explain.

1036
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,290
這很奇怪  他最喜歡解釋了
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.

1037
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,420
他說這案子很簡單  我都能解開
Said it was so simple I could solve it.

1038
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:20,980
他肯定是在誇大其詞
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

1039
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,850
你覺得他在做什麼
What's he doing, do you think?

1040
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,240
- 他說他在等待  - 等什麼
- He says he's waiting. - For what?

1041
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,640
等魔鬼
The devil.

1042
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,010
這可難說
I wouldn't be surprised.

1043
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,950
來這兒的什麼人都有
We get all sorts here.

1044
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,150
- 有變化的話就給我發電報  - 好的
- Well, wire me if there's any change. - Yeah.

1045
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,160
我要說的你都想到了吧
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

1046
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,180
或許我的回答也在你腦中浮現過
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.

1047
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,940
像顆子彈一樣
Like a bullet.

1048
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,030
這個習慣很危險
It's a dangerous habit,

1049
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:43,150
摸睡衣口袋裡上了膛的手槍
to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

1050
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,370
還是你看到我太高興了
Or are you just pleased to see me?

1051
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,060
請原諒我準備了些預防措施
You'll forgive me for taking precautions.

1052
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,910
你沒準備的話我會生氣的
I'd be offended if you didn't.

1053
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,480
當然  我也禮尚往來了
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.

1054
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,080
我喜歡你的房間
I like your rooms.

1055
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,780
散發著如此
They smell so...

1056
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,250
陽剛的氣息
manly.

1057
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,170
想必你在此之前就來過了
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.

1058
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,900
畢竟你總不在這裡
Well, you are always away,

1059
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,230
總在為《斯特蘭德月刊》探險
on your little adventures for The Strand.

1060
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,150
跟我說說  插畫師和你一起出行嗎
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you?

1061
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,800
你推理的時候  還要擺造型嗎
Do you have to pose... during your deductions?

1062
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,680
你曾六次趁我不在時來過我的公寓
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments

1063
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,760
- 我都發現了  - 我知道
- during my absence. - I know you are.

1064
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,100
順便一提  你的床意外地舒服
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.

1065
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,730
你知道灰塵的主要成分是人皮屑嗎
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin?

1066
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,940
知道
Yes.

1067
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,470
不過味道不一樣  皮膚還是新鮮的好
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.

1068
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,310
- 脆一點  - 你不坐下嗎
- Just a little crispy. - Won't you sit down?

1069
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,130
人本質上就是這樣
That's all people really are, you know,

1070
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,260
隨時會飄散的灰塵
dust waiting to be distributed.

1071
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,740
而且飄得到處都是
And it gets everywhere, didn't it?

1072
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,040
在你呼吸的每口氣裡  在每束陽光裡跳動
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam,

1073
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,460
那些精疲力竭的人啊
all the used-up people.

1074
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,250
真是有趣  你坐下吧
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit...

1075
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,770
人啊  人啊  人啊
People, people, people!

1076
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,370
什麼東西都要落灰
Can't keep anything shiny.

1077
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,190
介意我開一槍嗎
Do you mind if I fire this?

1078
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,400
好清理下灰塵
Just to clean it out.

1079
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,430
是啊  我們別玩了
Exactly, let's stop playing.

1080
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,120
我們要殺彼此不需要玩具
We don't need toys to kill each other.

1081
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,880
- 那樣可不夠親密  - 坐下
- Where's the intimacy in that? - Sit down.

1082
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,080
- 為什麼  你想要什麼  - 你自己要來的
- Why? What do you want? - You chose to come here.

1083
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,900
不對  你知道不是那樣的
Not true, you know that's not true.

1084
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,280
你想要什麼  夏洛克
What do you want, Sherlock?

1085
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,910
真相
The truth.

1086
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,170
那個啊
That.

1087
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,420
真相很無聊
Truth's boring!

1088
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,760
你沒料想到
You didn't expect me to

1089
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,040
我會出現在犯罪現場  是嗎
turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?

1090
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,890
可憐的尤斯塔斯爵士  他罪有應得
Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him.

1091
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,230
但他不可能是你殺的
But you couldn't have killed him.

1092
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,010
那又怎樣  這重要嗎  夠了  別這樣
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it. Stop this.

1093
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,790
你才不關心尤斯塔斯爵士  還有什麼鬼新娘
You don't care about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or any of it.

1094
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,580
整個事件中只有一樣
There's only one thing in this whole business

1095
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,970
引起了你的注意
that you find interesting.

1096
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,470
我知道你在幹什麼
I know what you're doing.

1097
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,550
新娘把槍伸進嘴裡
The Bride put a gun in her mouth

1098
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,750
把自己的後腦勺打開了花
and shot the back of her head off

1099
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,290
然後她復活了
and then she came back.

1100
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,200
不可能  但她做到了
Impossible. But she did it.

1101
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,880
你想知道是怎麼做到的
And you need to know how.

1102
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,550
到底怎麼回事
How?

1103
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,450
對不對
Don't you?

1104
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,120
因為不知道  你的世界都要崩潰了
It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.

1105
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,910
你是想阻止我
You're trying to stop me...

1106
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,270
想讓我分心  轉移我的視線
To distract me, derail me.

1107
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,620
因為你是不是想起了另一個案子
Because doesn't this remind you of another case?

1108
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,690
以前是不是發生過類似的事
Hasn't this all happened before?

1109
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,100
太陽底下無新事  到底是什麼
There's nothing new under the sun. What was it?

1110
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,650
是什麼呢   是哪個案子
What was it? What was that case?

1111
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,600
你記得嗎
Do you remember?

1112
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,910
就在我嘴邊  就在我嘴邊
It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the tip of my tongue.

1113
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,480
就在我嘴邊
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1114
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,340
就在...
It's on the tip...

1115
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,770
我嘴邊
..of my tongue.

1116
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,310
為了赫德森太太的壁紙著想  我必須提醒你
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you

1117
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,350
你的手指稍動一下  你就會死
that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.

1118
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,600
什麼
I'm sorry?

1119
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,710
死亡
Dead...

1120
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,150
是新的潮流
is the new sexy.

1121
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:47,520
說真的  這麼一來腦子還挺清爽的
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1122
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,670
你怎麼還活著
How can you be alive?

1123
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,640
我看起來怎麼樣
How do I look?

1124
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,720
老實說  是不是很顯眼
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1125
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,390
你把腦袋打爆了  怎麼可能活下來
You blew your own brains out, how could you survive?

1126
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,660
也許我該倒梳
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1127
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,540
我親眼看到你死了
I saw you die.

1128
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,420
你為什麼沒死呢
Why aren't you dead?

1129
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,550
因為喪命不是因為墜落  夏洛克
Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.

1130
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,890
你應該比別人更清楚  墜落殺不死人
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall,

1131
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,040
從來都是如此
it's never the fall.

1132
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,850
人是落地摔死的
It's the landing!

1133
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,450
我們落地了  先生
We've landed, sir.

1134
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,950
我們落地了
We've landed.

1135
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,930
不不  現在不行  還不行
No, no, not now, not now!

1136
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,880
現在不行  不行
Not now, not now.

1137
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,620
您的旅程還舒適吧  先生
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir?

1138
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,490
嗯  這次流放的時間
Well, a somewhat shorter exile

1139
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,840
沒有我們想的長  弟弟
than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1140
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,190
但考慮到你強迫症的程度  可能足夠了
but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.

1141
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,520
- 我得回去  - 什麼
- I have to go back! - What?

1142
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,430
我就快想出來了  就差一點點
I was...I was nearly there, I nearly had it!

1143
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,780
你到底在說什麼
What on earth are you talking about?

1144
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,330
回哪裡去  你都沒飛多遠
Go back where? You didn't get very far.

1145
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,730
瑞克萊蒂和他的恐怖新娘  你們不明白嗎
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?!

1146
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,430
我們當然不明白  你說什麼胡話呢  夏洛克
No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.

1147
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:13,380
是一個案子  一百年前很有名的案子
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.

1148
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,930
存在我硬碟裡
Lodged in my hard drive,

1149
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,260
她本來應該死了  但又復活了
she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.

1150
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,440
怎麼  跟莫里亞蒂一樣
What, like Moriarty?

1151
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,550
打爆了自己的腦袋  完全和莫里亞蒂一樣
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1152
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,680
但你剛剛才知道
But you've only just been told.

1153
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,620
我們也是才得知
We've only just found out,

1154
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,060
他出現在全國每一塊電視螢幕上
he's on every TV screen in the country.

1155
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,250
是啊  怎麼  麥考夫是五分鐘前打的電話
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.

1156
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,590
你們有什麼進展  你們做了什麼
What progress have you made? What have you been doing?

1157
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,980
更重要的是  你做了什麼
More to the point, what have YOU been doing?

1158
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,710
- 當然是進了我的思維殿堂  - 那當然
- I've been in my Mind Palace, of course. - Of course.

1159
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,660
做思維實驗  假設我在1895年
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime,

1160
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,080
應該如何破案
if I'd been there in 1895?

1161
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,220
夏洛克啊
Oh, Sherlock.

1162
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,090
所有的細節都很清楚
I had all the details perfect.

1163
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,930
我完全沉浸在裡面  全身心的
I was there, all of it, everything. I was immersed.

1164
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:45,790
當然了
Of course you were.

1165
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,690
你在看約翰的博客  你們相遇的故事
You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.

1166
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,160
有時候通過他的眼睛看我自己有好處
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.

1167
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,470
那樣我聰明多了
I'm so much cleverer.

1168
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,350
你真以為有人會相信你的說法
Do you really think anyone is believing you?

1169
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,760
不  他可以做到  我見過
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1170
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,230
思維殿堂  他大腦中有整個世界
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.

1171
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,900
是的  我需要再回去
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1172
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,780
思維殿堂是一種記憶手段  我知道它的功用
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do

1173
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,490
也知道它的局限
and I know what it most certainly cannot.

1174
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,240
也許有那麼一兩件事  我知道而你不知道
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.

1175
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,850
當然有了
Oh, there are.

1176
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,290
你列了清單嗎
Did you make a list?

1177
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,150
你又胖了
You've put on weight.

1178
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,680
馬甲顯然比外套新
That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.

1179
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,310
- 別說了  你列清單了嗎  - 什麼清單
- Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?! - Of what?

1180
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,440
所有的  夏洛克  你服的所有藥物
Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.

1181
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,420
不  不是那樣  他就是出神了
No, it's not that, he goes into a sort of trance.

1182
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,400
我見過他那樣做
I've seen him do it.

1183
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,460
從那天起  我和我弟弟達成了協定
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.

1184
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,930
不管在哪裡找到他
Wherever I find him,

1185
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:53,630
背街小巷也好  小客棧也罷
whatever back alley or doss-house...

1186
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,700
一定要有張清單
..There will always be a list.

1187
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,580
他不可能在五分鐘內服這麼多
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.

1188
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,690
他上飛機前就嗨了
He was high before he got on the plane.

1189
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,160
看起來不像
He didn't seem high.

1190
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,800
癮君子最能騙人
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1191
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,640
我不是癮君子  我只是服用藥物
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1192
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,460
減緩我的無聊
I alleviate boredom and

1193
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,040
或者偶爾提高我的思考效率
occasionally heighten my thought processes.

1194
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,850
老天  這可能要了你的命
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1195
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,920
- 你可能會死的  - 控制劑量一般不會致命
- You could die! - Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1196
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,460
節制的生活也不能永生
and abstinence is not immortality.

1197
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,430
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

1198
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,310
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂  我在搜她
Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.

1199
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,520
好吧  也許是該看看
Oh, I suppose we should.

1200
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,660
我有許可權查詢軍情五處的絕密資料庫
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.

1201
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,290
對  我正在那兒搜索
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1202
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,400
你認為軍情五處的防火牆怎麼樣
What do you think of MI5 security?

1203
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,520
弄一個也挺好的
I think it would be a good idea.

1204
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,710
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂  "懸案"
Emelia Ricoletti, "Unsolved",

1205
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:41,980
跟他說的一樣
like he says.

1206
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,710
你們能不能閉嘴五分鐘
Could you all just shut up for five minutes!

1207
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:44,950
我必須回去
I have to go back.

1208
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:45,900
我就快破案了
I was nearly there before

1209
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,810
結果讓你們跑進來吵沒了
you stepped on and started yapping away!

1210
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,400
吵  抱歉  我們是打擾你治療了嗎
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session?

1211
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:51,820
夏洛克  聽我說
Sherlock, listen to me.

1212
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,300
不想聽  你越說越來勁
No, it only encourages you.

1213
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,430
- 我沒生你的氣  - 我真松了口氣啊
- I'm not angry with you. - Oh, that's a relief!

1214
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,950
我本來還挺擔心呢  不  等等
I was really worried... No, hold on,

1215
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,080
我真沒擔心
I really wasn't.

1216
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,830
我以前救過你
I was there for you before.

1217
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,160
下一次我還會救你
I'll be there for you again.

1218
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,370
不論多少次我都會救你
I'll always be there for you.

1219
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,920
這是我的錯
This was my fault.

1220
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,550
這與你無關
It was nothing to do with you.

1221
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,600
入獄一周
A week in a prison cell,

1222
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,580
- 我該意識到的  - 意識到什麼
- I should have realised. - Realised what?

1223
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,740
對你來說
That, in your case,

1224
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,160
單獨監禁其實是和死敵關在一起
solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.

1225
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,620
我的神啊
Oh, for God's sake!

1226
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,160
嗎啡還是可卡因
Morphine or cocaine?

1227
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,990
你說什麼
What did you say?

1228
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,670
我什麼也沒說
I didn't say anything.

1229
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,150
不  你說了  你說
No, you did, you said...

1230
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,550
今天是什麼  嗎啡還是可卡因
Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine.

1231
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,550
福爾摩斯
'Holmes?'

1232
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,140
嗎啡還是可卡因  今天是什麼
Morphine or cocaine - which is it today?

1233
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,510
回答我  該死的
Answer me, damn it!

1234
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,680
莫里亞蒂來過
Moriarty was here.

1235
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,810
莫里亞蒂死了
Moriarty's dead.

1236
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,140
我剛剛在飛機上
I was on a jet.

1237
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,840
什麼上
A what?

1238
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,770
你也在  還有麥考夫
You were there, and Mycroft.

1239
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,740
你就沒出過門  福爾摩斯
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.

1240
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,800
連動都沒動一下
You...haven't...moved.

1241
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:08,730
告訴我  是嗎啡還是可卡因
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1242
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,560
可卡因  7%的
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1243
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,040
- 想來點嗎  - 不想
- Would you care to try it? - No.

1244
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,510
但我十分想把這兒所有的
But I would quite like to find every ounce of the stuff

1245
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,380
這破玩意兒都找到然後倒窗外
in your possession and pour it out of the window.

1246
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,520
那我會想阻止你
I should be inclined to stop you.

1247
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,530
那我將用強有力的方式提醒你
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly,

1248
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:28,830
我們兩個中誰是軍人  誰是癮君子
which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.

1249
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,260
你不是軍人  你是個醫生
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.

1250
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,390
我是個軍醫  所以說我可以
I'm an army doctor, which means I could

1251
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,130
一邊掰斷你每一根骨頭  一邊叫出它的學名
break every bone in your body while naming them.

1252
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:39,770
親愛的華生  你的感情干擾了你的判斷
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.

1253
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,900
辦案不吸毒
Never on a case.

1254
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,530
你保證過的  辦案不吸毒
You promised me, never on a case.

1255
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,230
不  那是出自
No, I just said that

1256
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,790
- 你的一篇故事  - 聽著
- in one of your stories. - Listen,

1257
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,870
我很樂意為你扮演捧哏
I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1258
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,830
我可以像笨蛋一樣跟著你到處跑
I will run along behind you like some halfwit,

1259
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,710
襯托你的聰明  如果你需要的話
making you look clever, if that's what you need.

1260
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,560
但看在上帝分上
But dear God above,

1261
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,940
你得給自己定個更高的標準
you will hold yourself to a higher standard!

1262
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,170
- 為什麼  - 因為人們需要你那麼做
- Why? - Because people need you to.

1263
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,350
什麼人  為什麼  就因為你的蠢故事
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories?

1264
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,910
沒錯  就因為我的蠢故事
Yes, because of my "idiot stories".

1265
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,280
福爾摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

1266
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,930
福爾摩斯先生  電報  福爾摩斯先生
Mr Holmes, telegram, Mr Holmes.

1267
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,820
怎麼了  出什麼事了
What is it? What's wrong?

1268
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,350
- 是瑪麗  - 瑪麗  她怎麼了
- It's Mary. - Mary? What about her?

1269
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,590
- 她很有可能陷入了危險  - 危險
- It's entirely possible she's in danger. - Danger?

1270
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,960
一刻也不能耽擱了
There's not a moment to lose.

1271
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,630
這是你吸毒的幻覺嗎
Is this the cocaine talking?

1272
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,270
瑪麗能有什麼危險
What danger could Mary be in?

1273
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,380
- 她肯定只是去拜訪朋友了  - 快走
- I'm sure she's just visiting with friends. - Come on!

1274
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,650
到底怎麼了
What is happening?

1275
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,580
你這狀況真的可以嗎
Are you even in a fit state?

1276
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:48,700
為瑪麗當然可以  這毋庸置疑  華生
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson.

1277
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,810
毋庸置疑
Never that.

1278
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:52,920
福爾摩斯
Holmes?

1279
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,330
我沒事  我沒事
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1280
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:57,580
別戴那頂
Not that one!

1281
01:08:58,930 --> 01:08:59,760
戴這頂
This one.

1282
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,220
- 為什麼  - 你是夏洛克·福爾摩斯
- Why? - You're Sherlock Holmes.

1283
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,620
戴你該戴的帽子吧
Wear the damn hat.

1284
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,210
馬車  馬車
Cab! Cab!

1285
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,070
說吧  她在哪
So tell me, where is she?

1286
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,970
告訴我  到底是怎麼回事
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1287
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,070
我的好華生啊
Oh, good old Watson!

1288
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,560
你不問問題我們這些閒暇時間該怎麼過啊
How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?!

1289
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,250
夏洛克  快告訴我  我妻子在哪
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is,

1290
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,900
你個自大的混蛋  否則我真跟你動手
you pompous prick, or I'll punch your lights out!

1291
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,010
福爾摩斯  她在哪
Holmes, where is she?

1292
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,510
一間廢棄教堂
A de-sanctified church.

1293
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,030
她覺得她找到了答案
She thinks she's found the solution and,

1294
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,210
也正因此
for no better reason than that,

1295
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,710
她讓自己陷入了巨大的危險
she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.

1296
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,910
老婆選得真好
What an excellent choice of wife.

1297
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,160
搞什麼
What the devil?!

1298
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,370
我找到他們了
I've found them.

1299
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,290
這是什麼啊  瑪麗
What is all this, Mary?

1300
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,500
是一切的核心  約翰
This is the heart of it all, John.

1301
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,210
陰謀的核心
The heart of the conspiracy.

1302
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:36,440
老天爺啊  這是什麼地方
Great God, what is this place?

1303
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,850
而且你為什麼會在這兒
And what the devil are you doing here?!

1304
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:40,760
我一直在調查
I've been making enquiries.

1305
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,090
應福爾摩斯先生之請
Mr Holmes asked me.

1306
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,300
福爾摩斯  你怎麼能這麼做
Holmes, how could you?

1307
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,420
不  不是他  聰明的那個
No, not him, the clever one.

1308
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,060
我認為很明顯
It seemed obvious to me

1309
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,570
這件事一個人無法完成
that this business could not be managed alone.

1310
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,460
我認為瑞克萊蒂太太有幫手
My theory is that Mrs Ricoletti had help.

1311
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,920
她的朋友
Help from her friends.

1312
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,770
- 漂亮  瑪麗  "聰明的那個"  - 我
- Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?" - I...

1313
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,230
我以為我要失去你了
I thought I was losing you.

1314
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,250
我以為我們
I thought perhaps we were...

1315
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,010
- 在冷戰  - 是你先搬出去的
- neglecting each other. - Well, you're the one who moved out.

1316
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,170
我是在跟瑪麗說話
I was talking to Mary.

1317
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,780
你怎麼為麥考夫辦事了
You're working for Mycroft?

1318
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,060
他想監督他的瘋弟弟
He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.

1319
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,590
而且手頭正好有個間諜  你從來沒發現
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you

1320
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,690
你妻子的能力遠超普通護士嗎
your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?

1321
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,720
他當然沒發現
Of course it hasn't,

1322
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,340
因為他瞭解護士的本事
because he knows what a nurse is capable of.

1323
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,280
你又是什麼時候發現的
When did it occur to you?

1324
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,890
剛發現  不好意思
Only now, I'm afraid.

1325
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,400
肯定很痛苦吧
Must be difficult,

1326
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,350
當天才的笨弟弟
being the slow little brother.

1327
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,840
也該跟上節奏了  聊夠了  辦正事
Time I sped up. Enough chatter, let's concentrate.

1328
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,770
好吧  這是在幹什麼
Yes, all right. What's all this about?

1329
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,710
他們想做什麼
What do they want to accomplish?

1330
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,320
進去弄個明白吧
Why don't we go and find out.

1331
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,730
抱歉  見到鑼不敲就難受
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1332
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,180
- 更無法抗拒戲劇性場面  - 誰能想到呢
- Or a touch of the dramatic. - Never have guessed!

1333
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,970
但你們好像跟我一樣  喜歡戲劇性
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.

1334
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:06,780
真棒
Excellent.

1335
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:09,080
一流的劇場
Superlative theatre.

1336
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,220
場面令人讚歎
I applaud the spectacle.

1337
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,940
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂飲彈自盡
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1338
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:20,600
然後起死回生  殺死了她丈夫
then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.

1339
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:21,970
那麼...
So...

1340
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,070
是怎麼回事呢
how was it done?

1341
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,050
整理一下這一事件吧
Let's take the events in order.

1342
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,140
瑞克萊蒂太太用最快的速度
Mrs. Ricoletti gets everyone's attention

1343
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,250
- 吸引了所有人的注意  - 你
- in very efficient fashion. - You!

1344
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,300
你
You?!

1345
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:39,990
還是我
Or me?

1346
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,980
她把一把槍塞進嘴裡
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth,

1347
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,100
開火的卻是槍口朝下的另一把槍
while actually firing the other into the ground.

1348
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,210
她的同謀向窗簾上噴血
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood

1349
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,550
這樣樓下驚慌失措的民眾
and thus her apparent suicide

1350
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,970
就都目睹了她自殺的景象
is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.

1351
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,760
另找一具
A substitute corpse,

1352
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,770
跟瑞克萊蒂太太非常相似的屍體
bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Ricoletti

1353
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,300
來代替她  稍後被送進停屍房
takes her place and is later transported to the morgue,

1354
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,820
這種自殺的小案子蘇格蘭場也沒什麼興趣
a grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.

1355
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,030
同時真的瑞克萊蒂太太悄悄溜走
Meanwhile, the real Mrs. Ricoletti slips away.

1356
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,530
真正聰明的是這步
Now comes the really clever part.

1357
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:15,580
瑞克萊蒂太太說服一位元認識她的馬車夫
Mrs. Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her,

1358
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,730
拉她去丈夫最喜歡的鴉片館外等他
to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.

1359
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,180
完美的舞臺  完美的一齣戲
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.

1360
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,250
你是誰  你要幹什麼
Who are you? What do you want?

1361
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:27,690
艾米麗婭
Emelia?

1362
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:29,320
救命
Help!

1363
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,520
身份得到完全確認
A perfect positive identification.

1364
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,010
已故的瑞克萊蒂太太起死回生
The late Mrs. Ricoletti has returned from the grave

1365
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,170
加上精湛的化妝
and a little skilled make-up

1366
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,320
寫就了一出怨靈復仇的戲碼
and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1367
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,700
還剩最後一件事
There was only one thing left to do.

1368
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,930
快點  別落淚
Swiftly now. No tears.

1369
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,540
接下來只需把真的瑞克萊蒂太太
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs. Ricoletti

1370
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,960
跟假屍體掉包
for the corpse in the morgue.

1371
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,750
這次再有人來驗屍
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her,

1372
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,060
就能確認的確是她
it would be positively, absolutely her.

1373
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,590
但她為什麼要這樣
But why would she do that?

1374
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,550
用死來證明什麼
Die to prove a point?

1375
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,510
大業都需要殉道者
Every great cause has martyrs.

1376
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:22,330
戰爭都需要獻身  沒錯  這就是戰爭
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.

1377
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,460
半邊天向另一半宣戰
One half of the human race at war with the other.

1378
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,080
這支常伴身邊的無形軍隊
The invisible army hovering at our elbow,

1379
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,140
打理家事
tending to our homes,

1380
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,220
養育孩子
raising our children.

1381
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,300
沒人注意
Ignored,

1382
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,050
不受尊重
patronised,

1383
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,810
被人忽略
disregarded.

1384
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,030
投一票的權利都沒有
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1385
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,090
但依然是支軍隊
But an army nonetheless,

1386
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,080
準備為崇高的事業而戰
ready to rise up in the best of causes.

1387
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:02,340
反抗由來已久的不平等
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.

1388
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,990
所以  華生  麥考夫說對了
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.

1389
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:09,200
這場戰爭我們必須輸
This is a war we must lose.

1390
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,030
她要死了
She was dying.

1391
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,230
- 誰  - 艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
- Who was? - Emelia Ricoletti.

1392
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,090
能看出明顯的肺癆症狀
There were clear signs of consumption -

1393
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,890
她應該是活不長了
I doubt she was long for this world.

1394
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,750
所以她想死得有意義點
So she decided to make her death count.

1395
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,630
她對美國的秘密社團已經很熟悉了
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.

1396
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,660
還使用了他們那套恐怖
And was able to draw on their methods of fear

1397
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,980
威脅的手法  在非常公開的場合下
and intimidation to publicly, very publicly,

1398
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,480
跟尤斯塔斯·卡邁克爵士對峙他過去的罪行
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.

1399
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,480
他在美國結識了她
He knew her out in the States.

1400
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,990
向她許諾了一切
Promised her everything.

1401
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:43,010
婚姻  地位
Marriage, position.

1402
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:47,160
然後玩弄過她...
And then he had his way with her...

1403
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,930
就拋棄了她
..and threw her over.

1404
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:52,910
丟下身無分文的她
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1405
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,440
霍普
Hooper!

1406
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,340
福爾摩斯
Holmes.

1407
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,730
我得說一句  福爾摩斯  她可沒瞞過我
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.

1408
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,620
您為什麼從不提我  老爺
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1409
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,550
艾米麗婭以為跟瑞克萊蒂會幸福
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti,

1410
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,810
但他也是個畜生
but he was a brute too.

1411
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:31,490
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂是我們的朋友
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1412
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,780
你不知道那個混帳是怎麼對她的
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.

1413
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,770
可是鬼新娘  福爾摩斯  我們看到她了
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1414
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,740
是啊  華生  看到了
Yes, Watson, we did.

1415
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,200
打碎玻璃的聲音
The sound of breaking glass?

1416
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,690
碎的不是窗戶
Not a window,

1417
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,730
不過是個劇院的老把戲
just an old theatrical trick.

1418
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,800
這不可能  福爾摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

1419
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,130
是不可能
No, it can't.

1420
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:55,280
叫做佩珀爾幻象
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1421
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,580
一個活人
'A simple reflection in glass

1422
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,930
新娘

1423
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,080
在玻璃鏡中的倒影
of a living, breathing person.

1424
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:03,330
觀眾

1425
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:03,440
新娘玻璃鏡中的倒影

1426
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:03,430
新娘

1427
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,560
只是她們不該在搬玻璃鏡時  把它弄碎
'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'

1428
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,010
看看四周
Look around you.

1429
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,660
這屋裡都是新娘
This room is full of brides.

1430
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,930
她死而復生後
Once she had risen,

1431
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,140
就可能是任何人
anyone could be her.

1432
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:26,100
尤斯塔斯·卡邁克之死

1433
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,640
馬車夫說  是瑞克萊蒂太太

1434
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,220
復仇的鬼魂
The avenging ghost.

1435
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:29,330
一個傳說  令心懷不軌的男人
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man

1436
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,970
又一位憤怒的新娘

1437
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,020
下一個是誰

1438
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,310
又一位憤怒的新娘

1439
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,100
下一個是誰

1440
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:30,910
  鬼魂新娘疑雲

1441
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:30,910
 "鬼魂"身份或已確認
馬車夫說
"是瑞克萊蒂太太"

1442
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:29,970
又一位憤怒的新娘

1443
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,130
恐懼戰慄
with malicious intent.

1444
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,730
糾纏不休的鬼魂
A spectre to stalk those

1445
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:36,770
與犯下罪孽卻未遭懲戒的禽獸清算過去
unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue.

1446
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,810
一支憤怒軍團覺醒了
A league of furies awakened.

1447
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,720
那些我...
The women I...

1448
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,430
我們欺騙過  背叛過的女人
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1449
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,550
我們忽略過  蔑視過的女人
The women we have ignored and disparaged.

1450
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,030
一旦產生了這種想法
Once the idea exists,

1451
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,180
就難以消除了
it cannot be killed.

1452
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,710
想出這個主意的人意志堅定
This is the work of a single-minded person.

1453
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:10,320
並且親身體會過尤斯塔斯爵士的精神虐待
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1454
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,440
陰暗的秘密
The dark secret,

1455
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,540
只告訴了她最好的朋友
kept from all but her closest friends,

1456
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,980
包括艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1457
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,440
那個多年之前遭她丈夫虧待的女人
..the woman her husband wronged all those years before.

1458
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:25,820
如果排除鬼魂
If one disregards the ghost,

1459
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,550
就只剩一個嫌疑人
there is only one suspect.

1460
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:32,230
是不是  卡邁克夫人
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1461
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:37,970
但是有一個小地方我不太明白
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.

1462
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:43,020
為什麼要找我阻止一樁
Why engage me to prevent a murder

1463
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,250
你打算實施的謀殺
you intended to commit?

1464
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,480
不太明白
"Doesn't quite make sense,

1465
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,470
不太明白
doesn't quite make sense."

1466
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:53,330
你當然明白不了  這不是真的
Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.

1467
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,120
夏洛克啊
Oh, Sherlock.

1468
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,010
躲躲貓
Peek-a-boo.

1469
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:01,980
不
No.

1470
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,970
不  不是你
No, not you.

1471
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:07,750
不可能是你
It can't be you.

1472
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,070
得了  鬧什麼呢
I mean, come on, be serious.

1473
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,470
扮裝  鑼
The costumes, the gong?

1474
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,710
作為犯罪大師
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1475
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:18,770
我得說我們可不會用鑼  或是扮裝
we don't really have gongs or special outfits.

1476
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,340
這是怎麼回事
What the hell is going on?

1477
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,080
這對你來說夠蠢了嗎
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1478
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,320
夠哥特了嗎  夠瘋狂了嗎  即使對你而言
Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you?

1479
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,510
你不明白  夏洛克
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock,

1480
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,630
因為這不是真的
because it's not real.

1481
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,420
- 都不是真的  - 他在說什麼
- None of it. - What's he talking about?

1482
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,990
這都是你自己在瞎想
This is all in your mind.

1483
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,740
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1484
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,770
福爾摩斯
Holmes!

1485
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:45,890
你在做夢
You're dreaming.

1486
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,250
他是在做夢嗎
Is he dreaming?

1487
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,900
他醒了
And there he is.

1488
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,550
還以為你已經去了
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1489
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,770
我問一下  這就是你說的"控制劑量"嗎
May I just check, is this what you mean by "controlled usage"?

1490
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:59,930
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂太太  告訴我她埋在哪
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.

1491
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:03,220
- 你是說120年前嗎  - 是的
- What, 120 years ago? - Yes.

1492
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,730
那要找上幾周才能找到  即便有這記錄
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.

1493
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,290
- 哪怕用我的資源來查  - 查到了
- Even with my resources. - Got it.

1494
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,410
我不明白  和這有什麼關係
I don't get it, how is this relevant?

1495
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,490
我得先知道我是對的  然後我才能肯定
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.

1496
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:17,300
- 你是說莫里亞蒂怎麼做到的  - 沒錯
- You mean how Moriarty did it? - Yes.

1497
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,210
但那些並沒有發生  都是你自己想的
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.

1498
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,850
我的調查是想像的
My investigation was the fantasy,

1499
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,600
但犯罪方式就如我剛剛所說的那樣
the crime happened exactly as I explained.

1500
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,690
她的墓碑是她的一群朋友所立
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.

1501
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,670
- 我不知道你以為能找到什麼  - 我得試試
- I don't know what you think you'll find here. - I need to try!

1502
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:31,720
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
摯愛的姐妹
忠誠至死不渝

1503
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,350
{\pos(283.8,110.8)}艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
   摯愛的姐妹
       忠誠至死不渝

1504
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:32,890
艾米麗婭·瑞克萊蒂
   摯愛的姐妹
       忠誠至死不渝

1505
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:37,900
瑞克萊蒂太太埋在這裡
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here,

1506
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,970
但是另外一具屍體呢
but what happened to the other one?

1507
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:42,070
在所謂的自殺之後用來替換她的那具屍體
The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?

1508
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,500
- 她們肯定給移走了  - 移去哪了
- They'd move it, of course they would. - But where?

1509
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,580
不在這裡
Well, not here.

1510
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,130
但是  她們肯定會這麼做
But that... that's exactly what they must have done.

1511
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,000
同謀者有內應
The conspirators had someone on the inside.

1512
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:50,650
她們找到一具屍體
They found a body,

1513
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,700
就像茉莉·霍普給我找了具屍體
just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when...

1514
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,020
這不需要再說了  對吧
Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?

1515
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,620
你不會真想這麼做吧
You're not seriously going to do this?

1516
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,260
我們正是為此而來  我必須知道
It's why we came here. I need to know.

1517
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,750
真是癮君子的口氣
Spoken like an addict.

1518
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,970
這對我來說很重要
This is important to me!

1519
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,720
不  你這是在嗑藥
No, this is you needing a fix.

1520
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,090
- 約翰  - 莫里亞蒂回來了
- John... - Moriarty's back.

1521
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,890
我們有案子要解決  我們有現實問題
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.

1522
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,490
我下一個就解決它  就快了
Getting to that, it's next on the list.

1523
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,240
我得先把這事做了
Just let me do this.

1524
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,250
不  我們總是讓你為所欲為
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.

1525
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,340
- 所以你才落得這個樣子  - 約翰  求你了
- That's how you got in this state! - John, please...

1526
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:18,020
我這次不會陪你玩了  夏洛克  別想了
I'm not playing this time, Sherlock. Not any more!

1527
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,010
你什麼時候準備好工作了  給我打電話
When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.

1528
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,740
- 我要帶瑪麗回家了  - 你要什麼
- I'm taking Mary home. - You're what?

1529
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,340
- 瑪麗要帶我回家了  - 這還差不多
- Mary's taking me home. - Better.

1530
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,450
- 他是對的  - 對又怎麼樣
- He's right, you know. - So what if he's right?!

1531
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,270
他總是對的  很無聊
He's always right, it's boring!

1532
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,460
能幫幫我嗎
Will you help me?

1533
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,540
法國諺語
原意是如果一個男人行為怪異
就"去找到在與他偷情的女人吧"

1534
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,540
找到這個女人吧
Cherchez la femme.

1535
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,630
上帝啊
Oh, dear.

1536
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,980
不在裡面
The cupboard is bare.

1537
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,580
肯定埋在下面了
They must have buried it underneath.

1538
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,490
肯定埋在棺材下面了
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.

1539
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:52,930
不走運  夏洛克
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1540
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,290
也許她們用其他方式處理了屍體
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.

1541
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:58,870
- 不  - 很有可能
- No... - More than likely.

1542
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,880
畢竟這是很久之前的事了
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.

1543
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,210
而我們可還有更重要的事需要辦  弟弟
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother.

1544
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,830
莫里亞蒂  死而復生
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1545
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:10,330
別忘了我
'Do not forget me.

1546
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:15,590
別忘了我
'Do not forget me!'

1547
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,920
這是
This?

1548
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,060
我明白了
Oh, I see.

1549
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,570
還是沒醒  是嗎
Still not awake, am I?

1550
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,430
太深了  夏洛克  太深了
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1551
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:10,050
恭喜  你將是史上第一個被活埋在
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history

1552
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:12,850
自己的思維殿堂裡的人
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1553
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:17,490
場景佈置有點誇張了  你不覺得嗎
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think?

1554
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,720
對你我而言
For you and me?

1555
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,310
一點都不誇張
Not at all.

1556
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:25,760
你到底是什麼
What are you?

1557
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,010
你知道我是什麼
You know what I am.

1558
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,020
我是莫里亞蒂
I'm Moriarty.

1559
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,450
犯罪界的拿破崙
The Napoleon of Crime.

1560
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,940
- 莫里亞蒂已經死了  - 在你腦中可沒有
- Moriarty's dead! - Not in your mind.

1561
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,730
在你腦中我永遠都不會死
I'll never be dead there.

1562
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:40,100
你曾說你的大腦是塊硬碟
You once called your brain a hard drive.

1563
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,470
跟病毒打個招呼吧
Well, say hello to the virus.

1564
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:45,250
這就是我們的結局  你和我
This is how we end, you and I.

1565
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,380
總是在這裡
Always here,

1566
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,640
總是你和我一起
always together.

1567
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,240
你的腦子很不錯  莫里亞蒂
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.

1568
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,940
我很敬佩
I admire it.

1569
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:00,910
我認為它甚至可能與我相當
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.

1570
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,440
我很感動
I'm touched.

1571
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,240
我很榮幸
I'm honoured.

1572
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,290
但說到在懸崖邊緣
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat

1573
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,300
徒手搏鬥
on the edge of a precipice...

1574
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,550
你等著入水吧
You're going in the water,

1575
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:17,160
小矬子
short-arse.

1576
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:32,740
你覺得自己高大威猛嗎  夏洛克
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock!

1577
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:33,950
在我面前可不是
Not with me.

1578
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,650
我是你的弱點
I am your weakness!

1579
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,220
我能打倒你
I keep you down!

1580
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:58,720
每次你失足  每次你失敗
Every time you stumble, every time you fail,

1581
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,590
每次你不堪一擊
when you're weak,

1582
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,420
我都
I...am...

1583
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,130
會出現
there!

1584
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:07,790
不
No,

1585
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,820
別抵抗
don't try to fight it.

1586
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,010
躺好  認輸吧
Lie back and lose!

1587
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,500
我們一起跳下去吧
Shall we go over together?

1588
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,090
必須是我們一起  是吧
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1589
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,960
到最後  永遠是你
At the end it's always just you

1590
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,870
和我
and me!

1591
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,500
教授  麻煩你離我朋友遠點
Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend,

1592
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,680
我相信  他有點反感你的糾纏
I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.

1593
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,810
這不公平  你們二對一
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1594
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,490
我們總是兩個人  你不看《斯特蘭德月刊》嗎
There's always two of us. Don't you read The Strand?

1595
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,210
跪下  教授
On your knees, Professor.

1596
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,620
手背到頭後
Hands behind your head.

1597
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,450
謝謝你  約翰
Thank you, John.

1598
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,270
你什麼時候開始叫我約翰了
Since when do you call me John?

1599
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:06,970
你肯定想不到
You'd be surprised.

1600
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,230
未必
No, I wouldn't.

1601
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,730
你該醒來了  夏洛克
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1602
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:17,060
我是個講故事的  我分得出自己是在故事裡
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.

1603
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,640
當然
Of course.

1604
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:21,040
當然了  約翰
Of course you do, John.

1605
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,080
他什麼樣
So what's he like?

1606
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,310
另一個世界的我
The other me in the other place?

1607
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:28,970
比看上去聰明
Smarter than he looks.

1608
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,670
那一定很聰明了
Pretty damn smart, then.

1609
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:33,540
很聰明
Pretty damn smart.

1610
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:37,330
你倆直接私奔得了
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?!

1611
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,980
無禮
Impertinent.

1612
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,910
過分
Offensive.

1613
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,700
其實  你介意嗎
Actually, would you mind?

1614
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:45,000
完全不
Not at all.

1615
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,020
- 本來就該我了  - 是啊
- It was my turn. - Quite so.

1616
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:59,880
你打算怎麼醒過來
So how do you plan to wake up?

1617
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,700
就這樣吧
I should think like this.

1618
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:07,590
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

1619
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,390
偷偷告訴你  約翰  墜落是殺不死我的
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.

1620
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,780
可你是怎麼做到
But how?

1621
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,630
很簡單的  親愛的華生
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1622
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,040
- 想我了嗎  - 夏洛克  你沒事吧
- Miss me? - Sherlock, are you all right?

1623
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,820
當然沒事  我怎麼會有事呢
Yes. Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?

1624
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,170
因為你可能剛服藥過量  你該入院
Because you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.

1625
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,390
沒時間了
Hm, no time.

1626
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,830
我得趕緊回貝克街  莫里亞蒂回來了
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.

1627
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:03,190
我都希望他是真回來了
I almost hope he is,

1628
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,510
如果能讓你不再沉迷於此
if it'll save you from this.

1629
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,160
現在用不著這個了
No need for that now,

1630
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,910
我有真正好玩的了
I've got the real thing.

1631
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:13,130
- 我有工作了  - 夏洛克
- I have work to do. - Sherlock...

1632
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:15,670
答應我
..Promise me.

1633
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,190
你還站這兒幹什麼
What are you still doing here?

1634
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,170
你不是該去幫我搞個赦免還是什麼的嗎
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something,

1635
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:22,750
像個好大哥那樣
like a proper big brother?

1636
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,550
華生醫生
Dr Watson...

1637
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,330
照顧好他
Look after him.

1638
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:38,060
拜託
Please.

1639
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,270
紅鬍子

1640
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,540
夏洛克  等等  解釋一下
Sherlock, hang on, explain.

1641
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,080
莫里亞蒂還活著嗎
Moriarty's alive, then?

1642
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,410
我沒說他活著  我說他回來了
I never said he was alive, I said he was back.

1643
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,680
那麼他死了嗎
So he's dead?

1644
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,530
他當然死了
Of course he's dead,

1645
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,750
他開槍爆了自己的頭  不可能活下來
he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.

1646
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,780
我剛剛為了證明這點而服藥過量
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.

1647
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:16,840
莫里亞蒂死了  毫無疑問
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1648
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:22,160
但更重要的是  我很清楚他接下來要做什麼
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1649
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,020
飛行機
Flying machines,

1650
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,390
還有什麼...電話
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1651
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,440
這是什麼瘋狂的幻想啊
What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?

1652
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,550
只是我對
It was simply my conjecture

1653
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:41,100
未來世界
of what a future world might look like

1654
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,640
和你我在其中角色的猜想
and how you and I might fit inside it.

1655
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,140
一個邏輯學家應該可以從一滴水
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer

1656
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,740
推斷出是大西洋還是尼亞加拉大瀑布
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1657
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,180
或是萊辛巴赫瀑布
Or a Reichenbach?

1658
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:53,150
- 你把這樁案子寫完了嗎  - 是的
- Have you written up your account of the case? - Yes.

1659
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,690
經過修改把它寫成了
Modified to put it down as

1660
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:58,480
- 罕見的我未能破案的案例了吧  - 當然
- one of my rare failures, of course? - Of course.

1661
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:03,240
《無形軍隊
The Adventure Of...

1662
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:05,300
歷險記》
The Invisible Army.

1663
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,490
或者"憤怒軍團"
The League Of Furies?

1664
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,100
"恐怖軍團"
The Monstrous Regiment?

1665
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,010
我倒想起名為《恐怖新娘》
I rather thought The Abominable Bride.

1666
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,350
- 有點庸俗  - 但會暢銷的
- A trifle lurid. - It'll sell.

1667
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:19,000
而且還包含了正式八經的謀殺
It's got proper murders in it too.

1668
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,220
這方面你是專家嘛
You're the expert.

1669
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,470
至於你的故事
As for your own tale,

1670
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:27,420
你還確定你只用了7%的溶劑嗎
are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take?

1671
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,710
我覺得你是不是調高用量了
I think you may have increased the dosage.

1672
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,700
或許我是有點異想天開了
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.

1673
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,690
但或許  這種事真的會發生
But perhaps such things could come to pass.

1674
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,680
不管怎樣  我相信我在那個世界會很自在的
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.

1675
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,600
- 我看我不會的  - 我不敢苟同
- Huh, I don't think I would be. - I beg to differ.

1676
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,990
但我一向知道自己是個先於時代之人
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
