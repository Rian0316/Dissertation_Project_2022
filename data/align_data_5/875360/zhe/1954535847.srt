1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,250
- 我想  可以看出来了 -不错
- So, I guess that decides it. - Yup.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,040
在咖啡屋待着
Hanging out at a coffee place

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,780
确实没有泡酒吧来得有趣
is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,210
伙计  那是什么
Man, what's that?

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,720
哪个？
What?

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,600
那个卖咖啡的漂亮女孩 在你名字旁边画了颗心
That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,160
有人对你有意思
Somebody has a crush on you.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,140
有人把你当成了我
Somebody thinks you're me.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,790
你们真的认为她喜欢我?
Do you really think she likes me?

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
我是说  那也不用大惊小怪
I mean, I guess it's not that surprising.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,410
每次我来这里 总能让她开怀大笑
Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,230
三周前
Marshall, here's your pumpkin latte.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,430
马修  你的南瓜拿铁咖啡

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,600
你是怎么把南瓜放进 这么个小杯子?
Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup?

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,900
-八天前 -给我来一杯南瓜拿铁咖啡
I'll have a pumpkin latte.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,360
他们怎么能刚好把南瓜 放进这些小杯子？
How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups?

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,330
什么?  你们有个收缩激光吗
What? You got a shrink ray back there?

18
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,151
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,200
-昨天 -还记得吗？
Hey, remember that time I said that thing

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,070
那次我说的把南瓜放进杯子里的事?
about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup?

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,870
- 哪一次 - 第一次
- Which time? - The first time.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,830
当然记得  很搞笑
Yeah. That was really funny.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,930
是的
Right.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,870
她觉得好笑只有两个原因
All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,310
那是她这辈子听过的第一个笑话
One, it's the first joke she's ever heard,

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,250
或者 她喜欢你 你应该约她出来
or two, she likes you. You should totally ask her out.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,860
你真这么想
You think?

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,370
你不和莉莉破镜重圆 不就是为了这个?
Yeah, that why you're not back with Lily, right?

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,850
这样才能体会到单身的乐趣
So you can experience what it's like to be single.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,330
如果这颗心没有任何含意怎么办?
Well, what if the heart doesn't mean anything?

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,340
也许她在所有杯子上都画了呢
What if she writes it on all the cups?

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,400
我这杯就写了泰德  没有心
Mine says "Ted," no heart.

33
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,430
这杯写的...斯华利
Mine says... "Swarley."

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,430
他们怎么能把巴尼弄成了斯华利
How'd they get "Swarley" from "Barney"?

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,530
这都不算是名字
It's not even a name.

36
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,640
有谁会叫做斯华利?
Who would ever be called "Swarley"?

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,580
别叫我斯华利
Oh, please don't start calling me "Swarley."

38
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,000
酒吧里决不会发生这种事情
This would never happen at a bar!

39
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,070
老兄  斯华利怎么了
Man! What's up with Swarley?

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,970
你从没见过老斯华利那么烦燥吧
I know. You almost never see old Swarlz get that upset.

知道吗?
Hey, guess what?

46
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,080
对不起
Oh, sorry.

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,120
是我妈妈
It's only my mom.

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,270
她只是像往常一样滔滔不绝
She's just rambling on like always.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
怎么了
What happened?

50
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,420
马修有约会了
Marshall asked out a girl.

51
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,443
Wow.

52
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,440
是的  都是爸爸的错
Well, if anything, that's Dad's fault.

53
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,420
这样可以让她说上一阵子了
That'll keep her going a while.

54
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,880
当然是这样  你知道吗 有人帮了他一把
Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help.

55
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,970
斯华利  帮他?
Swarley hooked him up?

56
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,070
你抢了我的台词
Oh, good. You got my text.

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,750
- 是的 - 事实上是我帮了他一把
- Yeah. - Oh. No, it was me.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,680
我传授给马修一个诀窍
I gave Marshall one of my secrets.

59
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,480
- 她怎么说 - 什么也没说
- So, what she say? - Nothing.

60
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,170
她肯定没听见我的话  她那么忙
I don't think she heard me. It's pretty busy up there.

61
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,970
什么?你摆对姿势了?
What? You gave her the look right?

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,910
低垂着头  眼睛向上
Head down, eyes looking up,

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,050
手插在口袋里  耸耸肩
hands in pockets, shoulders up,

64
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,980
再微微抬起头  含情脉脉  欲言又止
head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability.

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,290
应该是吧
I think so.

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,840
我们还是走吧
Look, can we just go?

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,550
马修的南瓜拿铁咖啡
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.

68
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,730
我没点那个
I didn't order that.

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,450
电话号码
Phone number.

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,750
我喜欢那个形象
I love that look.

71
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,470
我跟你在一起 就是因为你害羞的样子
I think I slept with you because of that look.

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
难道那是装出来的?
And it's fake?

73
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,130
那你咬着嘴唇  羞涩转身
Oh, and you biting your lower lip, shyly looking away

74
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,670
再用力挺起胸 那不是装的?
and thrusting your chest out is natural?

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,350
你说对了
Yeah, I hear you.

76
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:24,063
- Hey! - Hey, guys.

77
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,080
明晚有空吗
Are you free tomorrow night?

78
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,170
我想开个品酒会
I was thinking of having a wine tasting slash

79
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,630
一个'公寓捕鼠记'的聚会
"help me catch the rat in my apartment" party.

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,330
真是好主意 你可以让人和鼠共享奶酪
That's a great idea. You can put out cheese for both.

81
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,220
我该邀请马修 对不对?
I  should invite Marshall, right?

82
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,560
如果我不请他会显得太小器
It'd be weird if I didn't.

83
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,630
是的  不过我想他去不了
Yeah, I don't think he can go.

84
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,240
是吗  为什么?
Really? Why not?

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,580
是这样
Uh, okay, um...

86
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,820
莉莉  有些事得跟你说
Lily, we have to tell you something.

87
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,700
马修已经佳人有约了
Marshall has a date.

88
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,120
恭喜他
Oh. Well... good for him.

89
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,480
当真?  你不介意?
Really? You're okay with it?

90
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,430
我们半年前就分手了
Look, we've been broken up almost six months.

91
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,670
我是说...我不会为此欢呼
I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea,

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,830
不过他当然有权利跟人约会
but he has every right to date someone else.

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,790
非常理智
That's very mature.

94
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,460
你干嘛总拿着电话
Why are you holding the phone?

95
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,180
说的是
Oh, shoot.

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,030
真开心  妈妈
That's hilarious, Mom.

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,170
她完全没在意
Didn't even notice.

98
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,360
伙计  我喜欢那身衣服
Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit.

99
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,560
是什么面料的  进口货吗
Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?

100
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,500
是进口货  你很识货呀  泰德
Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted.

101
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,960
事实上是摩洛哥生产的
- It's Moroccan, actually. - Whoa.

102
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,470
斯华利  电话
I got a call for Swarley.

103
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,620
斯华利在吗
Is there a Swarley here?

104
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,680
你其实对我的衣服 不感兴趣是不是?
You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?

105
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,850
斯华利?
- Hmm? - Swarley!

106
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,180
是的  我知道他在这里  很重要
Yeah, I know he's there. It's really important.

107
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,690
你能再问一遍吗?
Could you ask again?

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,780
斯华利的重要电话
Important call for Swarley!

109
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,250
上帝  你听不见吗  斯华利? 有你的电话
Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you.

110
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,750
别再那么叫我
Stop calling me that.

111
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,300
让我正式介绍  克洛伊
Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.

112
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,301
- Hi. - Hi.

113
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,200
Hi.

114
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,730
很高兴认识你们
It's nice to meet you guys.

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,050
-我就回来 -在那边
- I'll be right back. - It's right back there.

116
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,720
-怎么样 -怎样?  她很性感
Right? Right? She's hot!

117
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,200
我们很相似
And she likes me?

118
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,500
她喜欢意大利食品  我也喜欢
She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food.

119
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,930
她喜欢比利・乔  我也喜欢...音乐 (流行乐坛巨星)
She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music.

120
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,890
我们还会再约会的
And I think we're going to go out again.

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,470
- 你要离她远点儿 - 显而易见
- Dude, you gotta ditch her. - Obviously.

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,860
为什么
Why?

123
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,170
她有一双疯眼
She's got the crazy eyes.

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,130
老兄  她的眼睛
Dude. The eyes.

125
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,830
它们很不正常
They're crazy.

126
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
你们到底在说什么疯眼?
What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?

127
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,920
那是对瞳孔状况的书面描述
It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi.

128
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,200
不  就是瞳孔
No. Just pupils.

129
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,680
它预示着精神状况的不稳定
It's an indicator of future mental instability.

130
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,440
她才没有什么疯眼
She does not have the crazy eyes.

131
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,160
你看不见
You just can't see it because you're afflicted

132
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,070
是因为你已经被激情蒙住了双眼
with "haven't been laid in a while" blindness.

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,940
在咖啡店她离得太远
She was too far away in the coffee place,

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,860
但刚才近距离观察
but when I saw her up close just now...

135
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,860
让我正式介绍克洛伊
Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.

136
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:44,961
- Hi. - Hi.

137
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:45,922
Hi.

138
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,700
很高兴认识你们
It's nice to meet you guys.

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,890
告诉你们 我不会因为你们这么说
You  guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe

140
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,380
就不再跟她约会
just because you think she has the crazy eyes.

141
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,440
你当然可以继续约她 不过你很快就会后悔的
You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it.

142
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,900
有一次  就在这个酒吧 我碰上一个女孩
One time, I met a girl at this very bar.

143
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,990
我发现她有疯眼...
I saw that she had the crazy eyes...

144
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,170
但我没在意...
...but I ignored it.

145
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,520
毫无疑问
And then, sure enough.

146
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,260
巴尼  能问你个问题?
Barney, can I ask you a question?

147
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,750
当然可以
Anything.

148
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,770
来次3P怎么样?
Would you like to have a threesome?

149
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,420
没问题
Of course.

150
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,190
好极了  就你 我还有鼬鼠先生
Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels.

151
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,040
你真那么干了?
So, did you do it?

152
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,550
不  最后还是双人游戏
No. It ended up being just a twosome

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,920
第三个在椅子上旁观
with the third one watching from a chair.

154
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,960
那你是哪一个
Which one were you?

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,540
我看最好别说这个
I'd rather not say.

156
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,400
有一段时间我也不相信疯眼一说
Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either,

157
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,350
直到我遇到了珍宁
and then I met Jeanine.

158
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,110
她的疯眼非常严重
She had serious crazy eyes.

159
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,000
我告诉自己 那只是我的想象  但...
I told myself I was just imagining it, but then...

160
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,780
我们去喝一杯如何
So, should we go get a drink?

161
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,200
去你的公寓  喝多久都行
As long as it's in your apartment.

162
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,520
哦  对不起
Whoa, I'm sorry.

163
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,440
当心点  看你怎么开车的
Watch! Where! You're! Going!

164
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,530
那么  你住哪儿
So, where do you live?

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,170
克洛伊才不会做那种事情
You guys, Chloe is not gonna do any of that stuff.

166
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
她是内布拉斯加州的可爱女生
She's a nice girl from Nebraska.

167
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,190
又不是疯子
She's not crazy.

168
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
她...她很迷人
She's... she's awesome.

169
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,580
但你不能永远回避 那双疯狂的眼睛
But you can't avoid the crazy eyes forever.

170
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,520
疯狂的本性迟早会浮出水面
Sooner or later, the crazy comes bubbling to the surface.

171
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,320
你好
Hello?

172
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,960
马修  我是克洛伊
Marshall, it's Chloe.

173
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,570
你一连给我打了九次电话?
Are you the one who's called me like nine times?

174
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,680
是  你能来接我吗
Yeah. Could you come get me?

175
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,140
可我正在考试
I'm in the middle of taking a test.

176
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,110
求你了  我很害怕
Please. I'm so scared.

177
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,770
到底怎么了
Well, what's going on?

178
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,800
有个奇怪的侏儒一直跟着我
This weird midget guy started following me

179
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,990
还朝我尖叫
and he was screaming at me

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,230
他跛着脚 还是个跎背
and he had a limp and a big hump on his back

181
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,640
警察都不相信我
and the police didn't believe me

182
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,490
我还差点儿伤在马蹄下  还有...
and I almost got trampled by a horse and...

183
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,380
天哪  你一定认为我疯了
God I must sound totally crazy to you right now.

184
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,350
不
No. Pfft.

185
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,640
当然不会
Not at all.

186
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,990
她是极端的疯狂
So, she's needy crazy.

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,780
那是最糟糕的状况
That's one of the worst kinds.

188
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,100
我也遇到过那样小妞
I've had one of those.

189
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,800
为了引人注目 编造各种故事
Makes  up stories to get attention.

190
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,000
跟她出门三周 她爸爸可以死两次
Went out with her for three weeks-- her dad died twice.

191
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,850
她是真的吓坏了
Guys, she was really freaked out, okay?

192
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,420
也许故事是真的
Maybe the story is true.

193
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,170
究竟什么能让你 相信那是个真实的故事
What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?

194
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,710
她真的很性感
She's really hot.

195
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,030
她们总是这样
They always are.

196
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,940
- 喝完了吗  泰德? - 是的
- You all done with that, Ted? - Yeah.

197
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,650
内德  我说过叫他内德
Ned. I told you to call him Ned.

198
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,660
真可惜
That's just sad.

199
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,440
对不起  斯华利
Sorry, Swarley.

200
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,170
就你和泰德住在这里
So, do just you and Ted live here

201
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,950
还是斯华利也住这儿
or does Swarley live here, too?

202
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,890
不  斯华利有自己的地方
Nah. Swarley has his own place.

203
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,280
怎么了
What was that?

204
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,010
我刚放下钥匙
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.

205
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,900
来了
So, here you go.

206
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,350
两杯南瓜啤酒
Two pumpkin beers.

207
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,220
开个玩笑 只是普通啤酒
I was joking. They're regular beers.

208
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,740
那是什么
What is that?

209
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,530
照框打破了
This picture is broken.

210
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,440
真糟糕
Oh. That's too bad.

211
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,260
那就是莉莉?
Is that Lily?

212
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,560
那个你差点娶过门的女孩?
Is that the girl you were going to marry?

213
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,730
是的 刚才的响声就是这个?
Yeah. Is that what that sound was?

214
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,970
你摔的?
Did you just smash this?

215
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,270
当然不是
No.

216
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,560
我为什么要摔它
Why would I do that?

217
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,900
让我看看你的眼睛
Let me look into your eyes.

218
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,070
没问题
Okay.

219
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,640
我今晚非常开心
I had a really nice time tonight.

220
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,930
我也是  别眨眼
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

221
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,710
我也很喜欢你的眼睛
I  like your eyes a lot, too.

222
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,980
停止
S top!

223
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,230
我是莉莉
Hi. I'm Lily.

224
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,450
停止
Stop!

225
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,550
现在孩子们  我知道 当马修和一个看起很疯狂的女孩约会时
Now, kids, I know Lily hiding in the apartment

226
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,850
莉莉正躲在屋子里
while Marshall was on a date with another girl seems pretty crazy,

227
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,210
但是听听莉莉的故事
but when you hear her side of the story,

228
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,280
那同样也很疯狂
well, it's still pretty crazy.

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,010
三天前

230
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,510
斯华利  你怎么样
What's up Swarlz?

231
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,730
别叫了  好吗  别再那么叫了
No. Okay? No. No more.

232
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,800
我不能再让你们那么叫我 就此打住
I will not let this become a thing. It's over.

233
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,780
再没什么斯华利 也没有斯华兹
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.

234
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,270
别再叫斯华利
No more Swar-lay.

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,250
听好了  没有什么斯华利
No more Swar... wait for it... ley.

236
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,840
没有  鲍勃・斯华利
No more Bob Swarley, mon.

237
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,800
停止吧  到此为止
No more. No! It's over.

238
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,390
你们的明白?
Do you understand?

239
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,230
知道了
- Yes. - Yes.

240
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,740
多谢
Thank you.

241
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,330
好极了
Nice.

242
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,520
-你为什么不给我打电话 -我该给你打吗
- Why didn't you call me? - Was I supposed to call you?

243
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,790
当然了  告诉我马修 和别的女人约会的事
Yes, about the whole Marshall- dating-another-girl thing.

244
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
你说你不介意的
You said you were fine with it.

245
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,950
在泰德面前  我当然要那么说 可我给你使了眼色...
Yeah, in front of Ted, but then I shot you a look.

246
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,300
什么眼色  像这样...
- What look? - This.

247
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,840
那不像是使眼色
That doesn't seem like a look.

248
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,430
那就是  意思是 我很难过  给我打电话
Yes it is. It means, "I'm upset call me later."

249
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,710
你该把我拉到一边 跟我说说那个眼色的含义
You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant.

250
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,590
如果能那样 我就不用使眼色了
If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look.

251
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,850
也许那的确是个与众不同的眼神
Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look...

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
先别管那个眼色了
Okay, the look isn't important.

253
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,800
重要的是  我受不了
What's important is that I can't stand the idea

254
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,550
马修和别人约会
of Marshall dating another woman.

255
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,030
要是他真爱上别人怎么办?
I mean, what if he falls in love with her?

256
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,820
泰德说那女孩有双疯眼
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

257
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,380
如果这让你好受点儿
Ted says she has the crazy eyes.

258
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,110
什么意思?
What's that?

259
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,500
男人能看出女人的某些特点
Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see

260
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,390
他们认为那女孩儿很疯狂
and it tells them that the girl's crazy.

261
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,080
就好像你从不...
Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy

262
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,450
跟指甲修得整齐的男人约会
with perfect fingernails?

263
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,330
古怪的家伙 就是那样
Jerk nails. Exactly.

264
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,660
那么泰德有没有说起 她漂不漂亮?
Well, did-did Ted say whether she was good-looking?

265
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,240
如果我知道她很丑
I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly,

266
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,350
可能我就不会那么担心了
then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out.

267
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,620
他没说  不过你可以自己去看
Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out.

268
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,140
她叫克洛伊  在第78大街 的可萨咖啡店工作
I think her name is Chloe-- she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.

269
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,570
斯华利・巴克利接电话
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?

270
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,130
你好  泰德  他不在
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.

271
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,360
很好  那么  记得别忘了
Good one, though-- remember that one.

272
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,950
克洛伊在吗?
Is, um, Chloe here?

273
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,180
她刚走 你也许还能追上她
She just left. You can probably still catch her.

274
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,970
她打着粉红色的伞  很好认的
She's easy to spot-- she's got a pink umbrella.

275
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,630
谢谢你  布莱恩
Oh, thanks, Brian.

276
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,280
我是斯科特
My name is Scott.

277
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,060
你的工号牌写的是布莱恩
Your tag says Brian.

278
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,560
我知道  说来话长...
I know. Funny story.

279
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,990
我早上醒来时...
So, I wake up this morning, and...

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
好的  再见  布莱恩
Yeah, see you later, Brian.

281
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,030
她就在那儿
There she is.

282
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,960
看起来也不怎么样
She doesn't look that great.

283
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,350
虽然不胖  那也没什么大不了
She's not fat, but that doesn't mean anything.

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,860
我可认识不少苗条的丑丫头
I know tons of skinny, ugly women.

285
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,510
就像瑜珈班里的鼻涕虫
That's right, snotty girl in my yoga class,

286
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,770
说的就是你
I'm talking to you.

287
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,380
快点  克洛伊  转过头来
Come on, Chloe, turn around.

288
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,170
快转身  克洛伊
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.

289
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,910
快点儿  让我看看你那丑样
Come on, show me that hideous face.

290
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
该死
Damn it!

291
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,270
对了  我该到她前面
Ooh, I know, I'll get ahead of her,

292
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,700
再转回头这样就能...
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!

293
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,410
天呐  疼死我了
Oh, my God, that hurts!

294
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,560
回头  快点儿
Turn around! Come on!

295
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,470
快回头
Just turn around!

296
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,860
好吧  就疯这一次
Okay, this is ridiculous.

297
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,612
Hey!

298
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,850
快回头  你磨蹭什么
Turn around! What's the matter with you?

299
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,940
嗨  前面的
Hey, you!

300
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,290
回过头来
Turn around!

301
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,490
转身  克洛伊
Turn around, Chloe!

302
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,840
她很漂亮?  真遗憾
She's hot? I'm so sorry.

303
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,230
不  这样也好
No, it's fine.

304
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,040
这样我就能明白
I-It just makes things easier.

305
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,720
她是一个威胁
Now that I know she's a threat,

306
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,790
我得阻止马修再见她
all I have to do is keep Marshall from ever seeing her again.

307
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,090
我有两个计划 你帮我挑一个
Okay, I have two plans-- you can help me choose.

308
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,260
A计划
Plan A--

309
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,080
还记得那次 我和马修的浴室激情?
remember that time Marshall and I had sex in the bathroom?

310
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,060
我简直筋疲力尽
Oops, I got knocked up.

311
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,200
-莉莉 -B计划
- Lily. - Okay, plan B

312
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,520
它叫做克洛伊事件
is called "Chloe's Accident."

313
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,010
- 等一下 - 怎么了
- Just stop. - What?

314
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,330
莉莉  你不能那样做
Lily, you can't do any of those things.

315
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
如果你们俩要重归于好
If you two are ever gonna get back together,

316
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,960
你就得让他自己处理这类事情
you have to let him work out whatever this is.

317
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,330
我知道  你说得对
I know. You're right.

318
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,530
走吧  泰德让 我们六点到楼上去
Now, come on, Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.

319
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,560
有个惊喜给巴尼
Some surprise for Barney.

320
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,560
- 巴尼? - 斯华利!
- Barney? - Uh, Swarley.

321
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:50,191
- Hey, guys. - Hey.

322
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,560
马修呢?
Where's Marshall?

323
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,950
他在理发
Oh, he's getting a haircut.

324
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,160
为他的约会
Oh. For his date.

325
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,720
祝他好运
Good for him.

326
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,600
希望他今晚过得愉快
Hope he has a good time tonight.

327
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,480
放松点 没什么好担心的
Relax, you've got nothing to worry about.

328
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,930
那女孩是疯子
The girl's crazy.

329
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,480
谢谢
Thanks!

330
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,920
他会像野猴子一样 跟她做爱  五次  最多了
He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max,

331
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,340
他会被她榨干的
and be done with her.

332
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,930
多谢了
Thanks again.

333
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,140
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

334
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,350
来点音乐  还能怎么样
I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all.

335
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
下一首歌送给斯华利
And this next one's going out to Swarley.

336
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,820
你的朋友们都知道你想念巴尼
All your friends know you miss Barney,

337
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,380
但他已经不在了 你要接受现实  宝贝
but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby.

338
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,270
这样你才能过得更好  斯华利
And, Swarley, you're gonna be a better woman for it.

339
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,360
这里是海伦・雷迪 主持的 "我是女人" 栏目
Here's "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy.

340
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,160
现在我是女人了 我喜欢...
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it!

341
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,960
我昨天整晚都在想这个新名字
You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night,

342
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,180
知道我发现了什么? 我喜欢这个名字
and you know what I realized? I like it.

343
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,900
你喜欢被叫做斯华利?
You like being called Swarley?

344
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,750
开玩笑  我当然喜欢
Are you kidding? I want you to call me that.

345
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,040
你真这么想?
Do you really think this is gonna work?

346
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,470
那还用问吗 我喜欢我的新名字
Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name,

347
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,810
所以  从现在起  就那么叫我
so please only call me that from now on.

348
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,100
叫你什么?
Call you what?

349
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,490
就是那个...那个... 你们常叫的那个...
You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me.

350
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,860
说呀
Say it.

351
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,720
干嘛  你们知道那是什么
Why? You guys know what it is.

352
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,410
说出那个名字
Say the name.

353
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,940
不  我不愿意  我恨它
No, I don't want to! I hate it!

354
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,420
我恨它  这不好笑
I hate it! It's not funny!

355
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,870
它根本就没意思 我从没做过任何...
It's never been funny! I've never done any...

356
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,410
不...
No!

357
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,160
当收到那些杂志订阅单时
Man, he is really gonna lose it

358
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,140
他一定会大发雷霆
when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in.

359
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,750
我给他订了《西班牙人》
I signed him up for People in Espanol,

360
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,550
但签的是斯华利
but I addressed it to Swarlos.

361
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,190
马修和我在码头 拍的那张照片在哪?
Hey, where's the picture of Marshall and me at the pier?

362
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,300
它不是总放在窗户旁边?
Didn't it used to be by that window?

363
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,810
你搬走后 他好像把它拿走了
Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left.

364
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,560
我想是放到书后面了
Put it behind some books, I think.

365
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,890
也许我该把它放还原
Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up.

366
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,950
干嘛?想让克洛伊 看见知难而退?
Why, so Chloe'll see it and get scared off?

367
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,060
不
No.

368
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,670
让马修看着它产生犯罪感
So Marshall'll see it and feel guilty.

369
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,620
算了吧
Yeah, okay.

370
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,800
可她没有就这么算了
But she wasn't okay.

371
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,530
那天晚上 马修还在约会的时候
Later that night, while Marshall was on his date,

372
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,730
莉莉又回来了
Lily came back.

373
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,270
还有吗?
...anymore.

374
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,980
很感人是吗
Pretty impressive, huh?

375
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,010
你真的记住了 我们没有点燃激情  这首诗...
Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

376
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,180
要喝点什么吗
Can I, uh, can I get you a drink?

377
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,610
啤酒就好
I'd love a beer.

378
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,320
稍等
You got it.

379
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,520
像所有理智的女人一样
Lily did what any sensible woman would do.

380
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,870
莉莉躲到了桌子底下
She hid under the desk.

381
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,670
她待在那里
And she stayed there, listening to her ex-fiance

382
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,890
听着她前未婚夫 和别的女人约会
on a date with another woman.

383
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,520
我今晚非常开心
I had a really nice time tonight.

384
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,570
我也是  别眨眼
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

385
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,270
我也很喜欢你的眼睛
I like your eyes a lot, too.

386
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,950
最后  就像比利・乔
Finally, much like Billy Joel,

387
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,660
她再也受不了
she couldn't take it anymore.

388
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,480
停止
Stop!

389
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,420
我是莉莉
Hi.  I'm Lily.

390
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,090
莉莉... 莉莉 你到底在这里做什么?
Lily... Lily, what the hell are you doing?

391
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,420
我不知道  我也不知道... 在做什么
I don't know. I... I don't know... what I'm doing.

392
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,780
南瓜啤酒  那很好
Oh, pumpkin beer-- that was a good one.

393
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,190
我只是...我走了...很抱歉
I'm just... I'm gonna go. I... I'm so sorry.

394
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,230
你们继续约会
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.

395
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,210
她看起来很不错
She seems nice.

396
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,720
- 莉莉  这是怎么回事? - 对不起...
- Lilly, what the hell... - I'm sorry.

397
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,870
我溜过来是因为...
I only snuck up there because...

398
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,610
昨天我发现她 那么聪明可爱  我很担心
when I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out.

399
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,970
莉莉  你昨天见她了?
Lily, you saw her yesterday?

400
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,200
是的  我跟了她整条街
Yeah, I... kind of chased her down the street.

401
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,560
等等  那你就是 那个驼背跛脚的家伙?
Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp?

402
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,100
是
Yeah.

403
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,510
她没有打碎像框 是我干的
And she didn't break the picture, I did.

404
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,950
那么克洛伊不是疯子
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...

405
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,620
她只是个可爱的 正常的女孩儿
just a nice, normal girl.

406
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,500
是的
Yeah, she is.

407
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,710
你是该找个 可爱又正常的女孩儿
And you deserve a nice, normal girl.

408
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,900
你干嘛还不上去
So, why don't you just go back up there

409
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,560
继续你的约会
and-and finish your date.

410
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
是的
Yeah.

411
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,580
好吧
Okay.

412
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,490
好
Okay.

413
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,390
等等  如果你是那个驼背 她怎么会认为你是男人?
Wait, if you were the hunchback, then why did she think you were a guy?

414
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,120
我是用这种声音叫的
I-I might have used a voice that sounded like this.

415
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,200
- 为什么? - 因为我不想
- Why? - Because I didn't want

416
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,400
让她知道是我 我知道这样很荒唐
her to know it was me, which I now realize doesn't make sense,

417
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,970
她甚至都没见过我
because she hadn't even met me.

418
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,300
你真疯了
You're crazy.

419
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,200
你的眼神比我 见过的任何人都要疯狂
You have... crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met.

420
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,250
你不是该回去...
Shouldn't you be going back up...

421
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,290
我说  你失去理智了
I mean, you're out of your mind.

422
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,530
你这个大傻瓜
You're... just absolutely insane.

423
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,860
你怎么还不上楼
Shouldn't you be going back upstairs?

424
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,980
我非常想你
I've missed you so much.

425
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,120
我们商量过了
Okay, I ran it by the group,

426
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,550
决定给你个选择机会
and we decided we're gonna give you a choice.

427
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,100
我们同意不再叫你斯华利
We will agree to stop calling you Swarley,

428
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,620
改为叫你詹尼弗
but instead, we'll call you Jennifer.

429
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,730
怎么样
Well?

430
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,550
我在考虑
I'm thinking.

431
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,960
这样如何? 每周一  三  五...
How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...

432
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,692
Hey.

433
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,320
看看这里
Look at this.

434
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,260
就是在这里
So right there, in the exact same place

435
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,440
六个月前在同一个地方 我看到马修孤单一人
that six months earlier I had walked up and found Marshall alone,

436
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,190
为他和莉莉分手而哭泣 现在我又看见他
crying over his breakup with Lily, I found him again.

437
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
只是这次他不再孤单
Only this time he wasn't alone,

438
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,360
他很开心
and he was happy.

439
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,610
于是我们去酒吧庆祝 真是棒极了
So we went to the bar to celebrate, and it was great.

440
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,490
我和罗宾在一起 马修和莉莉重归于好
I was with Robin, Marshall and Lily were back together,

441
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,430
巴尼有了一个很酷的新名字
and Barney had a cool new name.

442
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,800
一切都那么美好
All was right with the world...

443
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,940
直到我们回到公寓
until we got back to the apartment.

444
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,080
天呐
Oh, my God.

445
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,100
克洛伊  我...
Hey, Chloe, I...

446
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,040
我好像忘了你还在这里
guess I forgot I left you up here.

447
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,740
我打算走的 可我没找到我的钥匙
I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys.

448
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,720
它就在咖啡桌上
They're right there on the coffee table.

449
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,140
我真蠢
Silly me.

450
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,130
我把别的地方都找遍了
