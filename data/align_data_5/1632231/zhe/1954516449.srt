The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters.

The code also states
法典还规定

188
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,670
that if she disobeys, she will be reborn

If true,
如果这是真的

191
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
that seems like an awfully large gamble

192
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
given that the prize is Leonard.
你这个赌注貌似下得大了点

you need to live with cows for three months

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,030
Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy.
良莠参半  不可全信

199
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,540
My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.
我是说  你不能和莱纳德在一起

200

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,440
if I may quote Howard-- "do the dance with no pants."
用霍华德的话来说叫做"赤裸共舞"
