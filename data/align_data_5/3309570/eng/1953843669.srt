1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:03,296
The math is all there.

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:05,314
It's not real.
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,316 --> 00:00:08,551
Yeah... uh, look.
It is scientifically impossible

4
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:10,736
for a person to tip a cow.

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,356
Even you, with your stocky build

6
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,558
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

7
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,227
It's horrible. Why would
you push a cow over?

8
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:19,195
They're sacred.

9
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:20,446
Oh, stop it.

10
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:22,415
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

11
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,501
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

12
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,170
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

13
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:29,905
I clearly remember
the cow standing up

14
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:31,457
and then the cow on its side.

15
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,376
Were you drunk?

16
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,912
I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

17
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:39,849
I think <i>you're</i> the one
who fell over.

18
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:44,470
That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

19
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:45,638
Hey.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,090
Howard. Cow tipping:
real or not?

21
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:50,476
Mmm. I'm gonna say... not.

22
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:52,562
That's just based on me
trying to roll

23
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,697
my mom over
when she's snoring.

24
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,901
Speaking of that big
side of beef,

25
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:02,204
uh, she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

26
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:03,272
Aw.

27
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:05,207
Mmm.

28
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,126
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

29
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:09,462
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

30
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:11,247
offer up a polite excuse, so...

31
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:13,716
I'd love to go,
but, unfortunately,

32
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,585
that sounds awful.

33
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:21,040
Come on, it'll be fun.

34
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,391
Uh, we were actually
gonna do it here.

35
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:24,143
Please? Bernadette's
bringing her dad

36
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:25,261
'cause her mom's out of town,

37
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,396
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

38
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:29,798
Oh, since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,484
but that sounds even more awful.

40
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,970
It'd actually be nice
to not hear

41
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,738
Sheldon complain
about <i>my</i> cooking all day.

42
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,156
Yo... uh,
excuse me,

43
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:40,026
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

44
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,161
and every year I criticize it.

45
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:44,480
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

46
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,200
I want to go.
Yeah, me, too.

47
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,585
I'm in.
Sheldon.

48
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:52,038
Ugh, fine,
I'll go.

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,490
But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

50
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,658

Original Air Date on November 21, 2013

00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:27,133

61
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,614
Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

62
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,496
We do.

63
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,315
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

64
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:37,535
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

65
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:40,722
Being dragged
from their homes

66
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:44,125
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

67
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,295
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

68
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,048
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,766
in the history of mankind?

70
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,836
Yes.

71
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,888
Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

72
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,356
I spent one in Vegas.

73
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,340
You did?

74
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,342
Yeah, back when
I was dating Zack.

75
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:02,977
It was actually more fun
than I thought.

76
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,530
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

77
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,148
we had a really good
turkey dinner.

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,351
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

79
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,204
Wait, you went
to a chapel?

80
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,572
Yeah.
Why?

81
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:17,525
We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,513
Penny...

83
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,732
you know those are real, right?

84
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:27,218
(laughing):
No, they're not.

85
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,370
Yeah, they are.

86
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,423
No, they're not.

87
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,041
Yeah, they are.

88
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,710
He's right.
They're real.

89
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,315
But it... didn't seem real.

90
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,650
Let me ask you
a question.

91
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:47,989
At any point, was
Las Vegas on its side?

92
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,694
Hi, Dad.

93
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:54,028
Hi, honey.

94
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,332
Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

95
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,835
Uh, okay, yeah,
it's for everybody.

96
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,491
I really just wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

97
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,859
and watch the game.

98
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,294
You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

99
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:13,798
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
the medicine's not working!

100
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:16,868
WOLOWITZ:
You just took it.

101
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,370
At least let it
reach your first stomach!

102
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,193
Hey, Mike.

103
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:26,394
Let me help you out, there.

104
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,529
Thanks. What's wrong
with your mom?

105
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,897
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

106
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,034
Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

107
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,704
MRS. WOLOWITZ: How can one little toe
hurt so bad?

108
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,105
(sighs)

109
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:42,960
Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

110
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,214
(chuckles) She should
quiet down soon.

111
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:49,217
I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,705
I guess we're gonna
have to do all the cooking.

113
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,889
I have a better idea.

114
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,224
If you think you're
gonna make me

115
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:57,642
do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

116
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,510
I was gonna make Raj
do it all by himself.

117
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:00,961
Oh, well, that's
a great idea.

118
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,983
No traffic,
we're sailing.

119
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,101
Yes.

120
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,936
Like we're on a ship.

121
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,657
Coming from Africa to America.

122
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,612
Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

123
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:20,481
You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

124
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,167
Yes, Miss Amy.

125
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,172
I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

126
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,658
Ugh, would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,210
Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

128
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:34,011
You need to get
this taken care of.

129
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,464
I will. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

130
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,599
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

131
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,519
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

132
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,137
but every time
Leonard's proposed,

133
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,639
he's gotten a resounding no.

134
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:49,811
Yeah, that's just
off the top of my head.

135
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,646
So how do I undo this?

136
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:53,147
I'm hoping you can
get an annulment.

137
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,699
It's just like
it never happened.

138
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,400
Great, well, what
do I have to do?

139
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,069
It says here you can
get an annulment

140
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,871
if any of the following
conditions are met.

141
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,873
"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

142
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,825
(cackles) Penny? Next.

143
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:08,329
"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

144
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,914
want of understanding?"

145
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:10,965
"Want of understanding?"

146
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:11,999
What does that even mean?

147
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,035
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

148
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,755
Thanks for saving the day.

149
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:18,873
Ah, no problem.

150
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,040
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

151
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:23,210
without an Indian
providing the food.

152
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,214
Uh, now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

153
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,349
Um, I don't know.

154
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,184
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

155
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:34,605
I'll help Raj in here. Why don't
you go keep my dad company?

156
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,074
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

157
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:39,393
who has sex with his daughter.

158
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,998
Don't be silly, he loves you.
Does he?

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,534
Okay, he cares about you a lot.
Really?

160
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,620
I do crap for you
all the time. Get out there.

161
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:55,242
(crowd cheers, whistle blows)

162
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:59,046
So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

163
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,715
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,252
You know, my mom's been to...
(clears throat) Arizona.

165
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,939
She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

166
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,608
(chuckles) Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

167
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:17,097
(whispers):
'Cause she's so fat.

168
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,569
(doorbell rings)

169
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:24,038
I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

170
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,826
Hey, guys.

171
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:29,827
Happy Thanksgiving.

172
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,412
It smells wonderful.

173
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,664
Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

174
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,115
Because I, too, know...
Sheldon.

175
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,253
Here. Thank you for having us.

176
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,287
(scoffs)
What's with you?

177
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,472
Oh, she's mad at <i>me</i>

178
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,841
because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

179
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:44,842
Really?

180
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,811
That dumb-ass
she used to date?

181
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,430
(laughs):
That's hysterical.

182
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:52,934
I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

183
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,941
You need any help?

184
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,610
Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach
that, uh, gravy boat up there?

185
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,978
Uh, sure.
Great.

186
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,247
That makes one of you.

187
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,985
Okay, we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

188
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:13,588
Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yam detail.

189
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,989
Amy, you're on
rolls, cranberries

190
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,351
and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

191
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,962
That's right, I see you.

192
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,781
Okay, if you have
any questions,

193
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,483
I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

194
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,551
Focus is key.

195
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:30,221
Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

196
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,023
What?
Wha...?

197
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:39,013
You ever play football?

198
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,615
A little in college.

199
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:41,649
You?

200
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:42,783
No.

201
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,453
But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

202
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,288
(chuckles)

203
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,157
The whole school cheered.

204
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,211
Hey, I found the,
uh, court papers

205
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,696
that you and Zack
need to fill out.

206
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,415
I'll print them when we get home.
Fine.

207
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,700
And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

208
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:00,668
Are you done?

209
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,470
What?
Look, I get it, I screwed up.

210
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:04,171
Is this all we're gonna talk
about the rest of the day?

211
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:05,423
Why are you mad at me?

212
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,091
You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

213
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,726
I'm just trying to fix it.
Ugh!

214
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,127
I need some air.

215
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,679
Well... Penny.

216
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,547
Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

217
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,383
but I would not follow her.

218
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,571
Listen to Stretch.

219
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,717
How am I
the bad guy?

220
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,486
She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

221
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:38,240
Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

222
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,328
I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

223
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,813
Can I weigh in here?

224
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:45,914
Sure.

225
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,982
I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

226
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,019
Oh!

227
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:54,022
How do you not make
a first down there?

228
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,791
They passed against
a nickel defense.

229
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,559
They should have run it
off-tackle.

230
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,197
How the hell
do you know that?

231
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,832
My father loved football.

232
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,550
He always made me watch it

233
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:08,320
before I was allowed
to do my homework.

234
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:09,337
PENNY: Well, you'll
be happy

235
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,839
to know I just
spoke to Zack

236
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:12,524
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

237
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:13,842
He's on his way here now.

238
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:16,678
Wait, you invited him here?
Yeah.

239
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,513
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

240
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,181
Come on.

241
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,869
What do you think
they ought to do now?

242
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,187
I would throw a quick slant
to a wideout,

243
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,657
given that the defense
is showing blitz.

244
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:31,793
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

245
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,131
(laughing):
Get it?

246
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,500
'Cause it sounds like "blintz."

247
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,753
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Did someone say "blintz"?!

248
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,038
I just don't
understand

249
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,540
why you invited
him here today.

250
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,641
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

251
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,143
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

252
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,177
so I just thought it would...

253
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,979
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

254
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,314
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

255
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:55,066
No, no, speak up.

256
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,518
I'm about to use the blender,

257
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
and I don't want
to miss anything.

258
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:01,222
Well, you might have
to cook for one more

259
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,407
because she
invited Zack.

260
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,242
BERNADETTE: What?
AMY: Ooh!

261
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,228
My, my.

262
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,832
The plot, like my gravy,
thickens.

263
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,422
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

264
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:19,624
There's not an angle
to do one's business

265
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,243
without a clown figurine
staring at you.

266
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:26,014
That's why I sit.
(chuckles)

267
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:28,433
Yeah, that's why.

268
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,771
You remember
the Thanksgiving game

269
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,756
when it snowed
in Dallas?

270
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:38,393
1993-- Leon Lett blew the game
in the final seconds

271
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:40,362
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

272
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:43,365
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

273
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,818
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

274
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,737
So was my dad.

275
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,039
And then he did.

276
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,875
Anyone need a beer?
Yeah.

277
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:56,277
Thank God.

278
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,214
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

279
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,833
No. He died when I was 14.

280
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,003
I'm sorry to hear that.

281
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:07,722
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

282
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,194
He cried and cried.

283
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:13,895
Here you go.

284
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,931
Oh, thanks.

285
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,733
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

286
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,903
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

287
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,188
No, sir.

288
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,157
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

289
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,494
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

290
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,001
Well, you're having one with me.

291
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,374
All right.

292
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,677
To your dad.

293
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:53,218
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

294
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:59,224
Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

295
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,234
I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

296
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,936
Wonder what she saw
in that guy.

297
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,437
I don't know.

298
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,456
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

299
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,374
Broad shoulders, good hair.

300
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,910
Hmm. Wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

301
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,498
How's it going out there?

302
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,218
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

303
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,304
I know how you feel.

304
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:33,141
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

305
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,878
I kick it when he's not looking.

306
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,231
What are they doing?

307
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:44,686
They're drinking beer
and watching football.

308
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,054
They don't want me.

309
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:47,155
What do you mean?

310
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:48,640
Well, Sheldon
started talking

311
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,942
about how his dad
isn't alive anymore,

312
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,393
and they were toasting,
and I tried

313
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,862
to tell them about how sad I was

314
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:54,996
when my dad abandoned...
(doorbell rings)

315
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,848
AMY:
Zack's here!

316
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,117
Stir the gravy.

317
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,538
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

318
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,957
I'll be back in like five,
ten minutes.

319
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:12,547
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

320
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,599
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

321
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,217
Plus, Penny told me
we're married,

322
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:18,837
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

323
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,689
Yeah, okay, great.

324
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:21,891
Can we just get
this over with?

325
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:24,809
Yeah, uh, you guys
have to sign here and here.

326
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,611
On Monday, we'll file
for the annulment,

327
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:28,446
and this "marriage"
will be over.

328
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,781
Okay.

329
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:32,233
I don't know
if I want to sign it.

330
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,452
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.

331
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,872
Why won't you sign it?

332
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:41,609
I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

333
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,745
We don't have any kids.

334
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,380
Are you sure?
'Cause you didn't know

335
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,132
we were married
until this morning.

336
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,835
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

337
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,004
You know neither of us
thought this was real.

338
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:55,974
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

339
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,458
Of course it was
an impersonator.

340
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,145
We could never afford
a real Elvis.

341
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,849
You married him
instead of me?

342
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,651
Good call.

343
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,236
Sign the papers.

344
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,521
Hang on.
You know what?

345
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:11,406
You have been a jerk
about this all day.

346
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,907
You always do this--
whenever I mess up,

347
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,909
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

348
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:15,977
That is not true.

349
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,145
Yeah, we could've
waited till Monday,

350
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,697
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

351
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,281
You're the one who
invited him here.

352
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,866
Oh, there you go again--
just another mistake

353
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:22,917
you're throwing in my face.

354
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,652
Not cool, bro.

355
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,922
I'm starting to think

356
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,542
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

357
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,328
LEONARD:
Yeah, well,

358
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,930
she's not gonna be
your wife for long.

359
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,833
Oh, no. Are you dying?

360
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,886
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

361
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:47,609
Know what they say:
"Happy wife, happy life."

362
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,361
Let's eat.

363
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:58,653
(burping): Two, three,
eight, four, six.

364
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,491
That's all I can do
without throwing up.

365
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,076
(gasping)

366
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,694
That is not what I expected

367
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:09,664
when you said you
were gonna burp "pie."

368
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,585
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Did somebody say "pie"?!

369
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,171
I don't know what's scarier:

370
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,672
the bathroom clowns

371
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,475
or the woman
that put them there.

372
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:25,213
All I know is you can only fit
one of her in a car.

373
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:27,048
(laughing)

374
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,068
And there's the clown
that came out of her.

375
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,403
(laughing)

376
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,525
I really didn't want
to come here,

377
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,444
but this is shaping up to be

378
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,996
one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

379
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,232
Me, too.

380
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,235
Hey. Howie says you've been
making fun of him all day!

381
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,419
Now, both of you
apologize

382
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:50,088
right now!

383
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:53,124
She's so tiny.

384
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,180
(laughing):
It's funny when she's mad.

385
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,968
All right, mister,
I think you owe

386
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,805
Howard and Bernadette
an apology.

387
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,943
Perhaps you're right.

388
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,427
I'm sorry for my behavior.

389
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,613
I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

390
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:16,815
to be inappropriate.

391
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,817
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

392
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,735
Thank you.

393
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,237
Ain't she great?

394
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,321
Mmm.

395
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,656
(chuckling):
Sheldon.

396
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,607
Now, how's about you get us
a couple of beers?

397
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,145
Thanks again
for cooking.

398
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,663
AMY: Yeah, everything
was delicious.

399
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,664
Well, I couldn't

400
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,134
have done it without
my two favorite girls.

401
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,151
Aw.

402
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,370
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

403
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:59,843
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say
we go outside

404
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,929
and throw around
the old pigskin?

405
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:04,765
This is a Jewish house.

406
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,517
I don't think they have pigskin.

407
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,939
MRS. WOLOWITZ:  Did so!

408
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,392
Hey, honey, I'm
sorry about today.

409
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,511
And I promise, next
time I get married,

410
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,062
it won't be a joke.

411
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,680
It'll be for love.

412
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,816
Or money.

413
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,121
I'm sorry, too.

414
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,655
ZACK:
Don't be.

415
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:29,656
It's my fault.

416
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,074
I was a terrible husband.

417
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,379
I was never around.

418
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:39,216
I know I'm hard on you,

419
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,002
but you're not the worst
son-in-law in the world.

420
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,922
Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

421
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,724
Well, I'm drunk.

422
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,230
I just vomited
on a lot of clowns.

423
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:58,232
