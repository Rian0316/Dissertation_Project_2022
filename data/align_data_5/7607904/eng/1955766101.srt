00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,268
You are both such...

183
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,515
stubborn...
donkey butts!

184
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,315
(Missy laughing)
Missy!

185
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:30,627
Go to bed.

186
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,234
MISSY:
You don't know it's me.

187
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,885
(running footsteps, door closes)

188
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:37,244
(crickets chirping)

189
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,252
Hey.

190
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,336
What do you want?

191
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,703
Don't be that way.

192
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,627
I brought you a cold one.

193
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,449
Thanks.

194
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:50,910
I still don't like you.

195
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,778
(chuckling)

196
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,932
Would this change
your feelings?

197
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,489
Is that it?

198
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,798
The Holy Grail.

199
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,190
What changed your mind?

200
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,479
You not going
to the picnic today,

201
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,338
that hurt Mary
and the twins.

202
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:17,339
I cannot have that
on my heart.

203
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,456
Is that so?
Absolutely.

204
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:22,409
Look me in the eye
and tell me

205
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,854
this is the actual recipe.

206
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,655
George, what you have
in your hand

207
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:31,666
is the exact
step-by-step instructions

208
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,453
on how to make my brisket.

209
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:38,510
I have never written it down
until tonight because...

210
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:42,369
I was afraid
someone might steal it.

211
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,275
But I'm entrusting
this to you,

212
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,447
and I hope that someday,
when the time is right,

213
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:52,947
you will see fit to share it
with one of your children.

214
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,455
Connie, I don't
know what to say.

215
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,248
Don't call me Connie.

216
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:59,293
Call me Mom.
(chuckles)

217
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,041

You told her we
went over there?

279
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,638
(gasps)
Oh, George Jr.

280
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,513
I didn't say nothing.
I was cool.

want to see her?

285
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,087
Fine.

About what?

292
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,311
Mom is so upset
about Dad and Meemaw,

293
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,980
she might want a divorce.

294
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,526
No one's getting divorced.

295
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,651
How do you know?

296
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,081
(whistles)

297
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:41,886
Great, now I have
to throw that out.

298
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:45,995
Mother-in-laws are always held
in low regard by the father.

299
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,550
It rarely leads
to a breakup of the family.

300
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,775
MISSY:
He's right.

301
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,143
Fred and Wilma
are still happily married.

302
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,131
I think if we can figure out

303
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,233
a way for Dad to get
Meemaw's brisket recipe,

304
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,635
this all goes away.

305
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,737
I don't see how
we can accomplish that.

306
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,038
(train clatters)

307
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,707
Put that down.

308
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:03,975
That's not a toy.

309
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,109
Sure it is.

310
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,711

312
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,348
Choo choo.

313

Open wide, Moonpie.

314
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,754
Here comes the choo choo train.

315
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,255
Choo choo.

316
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,791
Mmm. Isn't that good?

317
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:21,893
(chuckles)

318
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,262
That's Meemaw's famous brisket.

319
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,471
Would you like
the secret recipe?

320
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,629
(gasps)

321
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:31,089
You promise not to tell anybody?

322
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,271
Of course you're not gonna
tell anybody.

323
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:37,675
I start with a tablespoon
of cumin,

324
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:41,111
and then a cup
of brown sugar, and...

325
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,880
I know the recipe.

326
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,048
What?

327
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,909
- She told it to me.
- When?

328
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,476
February 14, 1982.

329
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,835
I was 23 months old,
it was Valentine's Day,

330
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,815
and Mom and Dad
went out for dinner.

331
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,959
You were there.
Don't you remember?

332
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,861
(sighs)

333
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,261
(wind whistling softly)

334
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,940
I got nothing.

335
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,679
You can really remember
when you were that little?

336
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,979
Uh-huh. You were there, too.

337
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,839
You were still struggling
with potty training.

338
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,532
(chuckling):
I don't think so.

339
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:11,909
Oh, yes. Meemaw used to call you
Mr. Soggy Pants.

340
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,019
Nuh-uh.

341
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,516
(laughs):
Mr. Soggy Pants.

342
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,261
Quit it. This is serious.

343
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,311
Sheldon, you've got
to tell Dad that recipe.

344
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:21,038
But Meemaw told me
it was a secret.

345
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:24,194
If you don't, and Mom and Dad
get a divorce, it's your fault.

346
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,638
All right.

347
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:27,931
Fine.

348
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,108
Good job, Soggy Pants.

349
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,330
(referee whistle blowing
over TV)

350
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:36,592
Dad, could you please
come into the living room?

351
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,850
What for?

352
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,308
My brain
did something impressive

353
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,305
and I'd like to share it
with you.

354
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:43,974
Hmm.

355
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:46,897
(George Sr. grunts)

356
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,108
What are you doing here?

357
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,475
Same as you.

358
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,561
I want to see
what his brain did.

359
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,452
Please have a seat.

360
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,498
All right.

361
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,177
(grunts)

362
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:03,590
GEORGE SR.:
Well?

363
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,905
I know Meemaw's brisket recipe.

364
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,030
What?

365
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,144
No, you don't.

366
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,335
Yes, I do.

367
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,936
And in order to bring peace
to this family,

368
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,532
I'm prepared to make it public.

369
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,611
You're bluffing.

370
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,086
One tablespoon of cumin,

371
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,374
one cup of brown sugar,

372
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,274
two tablespoons
of smoked paprika...

373
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,352
Okay, okay, stop.

374
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,453
No, no, no. Keep going.

375
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,211
How do you know
the recipe, Shelly?

376
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:26,368
Meemaw told it to me
on Valentine's Day, 1982.

377
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,594
You were out with Dad
seeing Cannonball Run

378
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,729
at the dollar theater.

379
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,323
That's impossible, you weren't
even two years old.

380
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,158
Three tablespoons
of dried mustard,

381
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,368
one cup of Lone Star beer...

382
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,227
Okay.

383
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:39,810
Okay.

384
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,585
Go ahead.

385
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:43,673
Give it to your father.

386
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,675
I can write it down for you.

387
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,939
That's okay,
I don't want it.

388
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,086
(quietly):
You have got to be kidding me.

389
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,653
Connie, you've had
every opportunity

390
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,221
to give me that recipe
and you never did,

391
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,884
because you've always
treated me like an outsider.

392
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:56,957
No, she has not.

393
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,235
Oh, of course I have.

394
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,563
See? She admits it.

395
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,518
(sighs)
Damn right, I do.

396
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:04,680
Never thought you were good
enough for my daughter.

397
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,766
There you were, riding around
on that dumb motorcycle,

398
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:08,849
knocking her up.

399
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,427
Why don't you kids
go in the kitchen

400
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,821
and fix yourselves
some ice cream?

401
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,938
I'm not going anywhere.

402
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,078
Hey. I get it.

403
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:19,844
I have a daughter.

404
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,899
I wouldn't want her bringing
home someone like that.

405
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,719
But I've come
a hell of a long way since then.

406
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,828
Okay, you're right.

407
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,181
George.

408
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,914
I'm sorry.

409
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,367
That means more to me
than any recipe.

410
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,780
Come here.

411
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,245
(Meemaw chuckles)

412
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,748
♪♪

413
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:59,099
ADULT SHELDON:
Don't let the hug fool you.

414
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:02,498
The minute she went home,
he made me give him the recipe.

415
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,631
Here we go, maiden voyage.

416
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,959
Mmm, mmm.

417
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,889
Hot damn.

418
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,171
GEORGE SR.:
Hot damn.

419
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,408
(George Sr. moaning)

420
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,343
Hot damn!

421
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,900
MARY (laughs):
George! Language.

422
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,213
Sheldon.

423
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,954
Want some?

424
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:29,463
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm not hungry.
