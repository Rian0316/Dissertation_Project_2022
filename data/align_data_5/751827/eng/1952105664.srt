1
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,707
I am still not happy
with this report, Humphrey.

2
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:52,432
Then we shall be happy
to redraft it for you.

3
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:55,948
- You have redrafted it three times.
- That's not absolutely correct.

4
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,184
Yes, it is, I can count.
This is the third draft report.

5
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,183
Therefore
it has been drafted once

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,229
and subsequently
redrafted twice.

7
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:04,791
Don't quibble, Bernard.

8
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,623
We shall be happy
to redraft a third time.

9
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,101
And a fourth and fifth.
And a sixth, no doubt.

10
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:12,786
And it still say
what you want it to say.

11
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:15,750
- Not what I want it to say.
- What do you want it to say?

12
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:17,709
We want it to say
what you want to.

13
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,181
Not anything you don'twant to.

14
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:21,944
Stop wittering!

15
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:25,551
The Think Tank asked us

16
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,351
forourevidence
on Civil Service overmanning.

17
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:32,141
I have briefed a group of civil
servants in words of one syllable

18
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,951
and they've sent back
an unintelligible report,

19
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:37,990
saying the exact opposite
of what I asked them to say.

20
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:41,030
With respect, how do you know
it says the opposite

21
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,989
if it's totally unintelligible?

22
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,907
All I am saying is
that the Civil Service

23
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,632
is grossly overmanned
and must be slimmed down.

24
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,828
Quite so.
That is what the report says.

25
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,823
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

26
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:56,826
No, it... Look, what I'm talking
about is a phased reduction

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,631
in the Civil Service
of about 200,000 people.

28
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,669
Are you going to put that
in this report?

29
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:04,671
If you were to take
that draft home and study it,

30
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:08,142
you might find that it says
what you want it to say.

31
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:11,185
- And if it doesn't?
- Then we can redraft it.

32
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,790
Humphrey, sit down.

33
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,864
Will you give me a straight
answerto a straight question?

34
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:22,871
Oh, well, Minister, as long as
you are not asking me to resort

35
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:26,388
to crude generalisations
and vulgaroversimplifications,

36
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:29,703
such as a simple yes orno
I shall do my utmost to oblige.

37
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,106
Is that "yes"?

38
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:38,860
- Yes.
- Right.

39
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:42,104
- Here is the straight question.
- I thought thatwas it.

40
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:47,341
When you give yourevidence,
are you going to support my view

41
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:50,424
that the Civil Service
is overmanned ornot?

42
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,747
Yes orno!

43
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:53,591
Straight answer!

44
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:56,712
If you ask me
fora straight answer

45
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,944
then I shall say that,
as faras we can see,

46
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,707
looking at it by an large,
taking one time with another,

47
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,942
in terms of the average
of departments,

48
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,104
then in the final analysis
it is probably true to say

49
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,105
that at the end of the day,
in general terms,

50
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,990
you would probablyfind that

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,188
not to put
too fine a point on it,

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,503
there probably wasn't very much
in it one way orthe other.

53
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:24,065
As faras one can see...
at this stage.

54
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,229
Is that "yes"? Or"no"?

55
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:30,871
Yes and no.

56
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:34,140
Suppose you weren't asked
fora straight answer?

57
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:36,582
Then I should playfortime.

58
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:42,667
Sir Humphrey.

59
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:46,063
- Ah, Bernard, do sit down.
- Thank you.

60
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,707
- Good of you to pop in.
- It's my pleasure.

61
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:53,268
Bernard, you know
the Department's report

62
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,741
on the Central Policy
Review staff?

63
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,351
Er, yes, Sir Humphrey.

64
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,548
We haven't had it back
from the Ministeryet.

65
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:01,942
- Er, no, Sir Humphrey.
- Why not?

66
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:05,900
Er... perhaps
you should ask the Minister.

67
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:09,304
- No, I'm asking you, Bernard.
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.

68
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,628
You don't seem to be replying.

69
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,783
Yes and no, Sir Humphrey.

70
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:20,350
- Are you trying to be impertinent?
- Oh no.

71
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,389
I would succeed if I tried.

72
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,902
- Scotch on the rocks, please.
- Yes, sir. One, sir?

73
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:29,551
Yes, just one.

74
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:34,065
Has the Ministerbeen doing
his boxes properly?

75
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,871
- Yes, he's very conscientious.
- Then what's going on?

76
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:40,311
- You should ask the Minister.
- I'm asking you.

77
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:43,669
But as the Minister's Secretary,
I'm responsible to him.

78
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,743
But you are also a public servant.

79
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,981
The average Minister's tenure
is less than eleven months,

80
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:53,224
but yourcareerwill last
until you're 65, won't it?

81
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,781
- I hope so. Yes.
- So do I, Bernard.

82
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:01,068
However, the choice is yours.

83
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,309
Er, Sir Humphrey...

84
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:09,664
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

85
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:12,943
That's always a good idea.

86
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:17,301
Well, suppose a Minister,
a purely hypothetical Minister,

87
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:20,032
were to be unhappy
with a department draft

88
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,864
of evidence to a committee.

89
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:26,790
And suppose that Minister
were planning to replace it

90
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,581
with his own draftworked out
with his political adviser

91
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,947
- and his party...
- I can't believe it.

92
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,831
Oh, no, no.
It's purely hypothetical.

93
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:39,786
And suppose that Minister
were planning to bring in

94
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:43,991
his own draft so close to the final
date that there won't be any...

95
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:45,666
- Wouldn't...
- Wouldn't

96
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:48,983
be any time forthe Department
to redraft it forhim.

97
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,501
Well?

98
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:55,302
Suppose this hypothetical Minister's
Principal Private Secretary

99
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,349
were to be aware of this

100
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:00,629
hypothetical draft,
in confidence of course,

101
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,341
should he pass on this information
to the Permanent Secretary

102
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,707
of this hypothetical department?

103
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:08,425
Certainly not, Bernard.

104
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,624
Not if this Principal Private Secretary
had been given

105
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,703
the information in confidence.

106
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,988
That's what I thought,
Sir Humphrey.

107
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,903
Have a drink, Bernard.

108
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:23,031
One more thing, Minister.

109
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,387
The evidence to the Central
Policy Review Staff.

110
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,588
- You mean the Think Tank?
- Yes, Minister.

111
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:30,664
Have you redrafted
the redraft of yourdraft?

112
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,823
- You don'twant it yet, do you?
- Yes.

113
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,869
- Why?
- So thatwe can redraft it.

114
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,148
- Thatwon't be necessary.
- I think itwill.

115
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:40,430
Drafting is not a Civil Service
monopoly, you know?

116
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,184
No, it's a highly
specialised skill

117
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,502
which few outside
the Service can master.

118
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,390
Nonsense.
Drafts is easy.

119
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:48,144
It's a game anyone can play.

120
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:52,908
Notwithout getting huffed.

121
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:57,701
So could I have
the draft proposal, please?

122
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,305
Certainly, Humphrey.

123
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,266
- When, Minister?
- Later, Humphrey.

124
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,706
Yes, but when?

125
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,783
You always say
we musn't rush things.

126
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:08,182
I must ask you
fora straight answer.

127
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,707
On what day? Tomorrow?
Monday? Tuesday?

128
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:12,944
In due course, Humphrey.

129
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:15,024
At the appropriate juncture.

130
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,183
In the fullness of time.

131
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,302
When the moment is ripe.

132
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,146
When the necessary procedures
have been completed.

133
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,143
Nothing precipitate, of course.

134
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,223
Minister, this is getting urgent.

135
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:30,111
Urgent, Humphrey?
What a lot ot newwords!

136
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,344
You'll forgive me if I say this,

137
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:36,184
but I am beginning to suspect

138
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,502
that you are concealing
something from me.

139
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:42,108
You and I have no secrets
from each other, have we?

140
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:45,105
I'm sorry, but sometimes
one is forced to consider

141
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:48,628
the possibility that affairs
are being conducted in a way

142
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:53,183
which, all things being considered,
and making all possible allowances,

143
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,912
is, not to put too fine
a point on it,

144
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,984
perhaps not entirely straightforward.

145
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:01,302
You're the expert
on straightforwardness.

146
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:04,629
So what about
the draft evidence?

147
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:09,502
Well, since you ask, Humphrey,
and to be perfectly straightforward,

148
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,067
I have redrafted it myself.

149
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,269
I don'twant you to redraft it.

150
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:17,345
I'm perfectly happy
with it as it is.

151
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:22,063
May I be bold enough
to ask what you have said?

152
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:26,141
What I wanted: Phased
reductions in the Civil Service.

153
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,462
You have frustrated me
overopen government,

154
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:32,022
and the economy drive,
this time I'm going to have my way.

155
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,342
The party wants it,
the public wants it.

156
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:38,903
And all we get from the Civil
Service is delaying tactics.

157
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:42,343
I wouldn't call Civil Service
delays "tactics", Minister,

158
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,946
thatwould be to mistake
lethargyforstrategy.

159
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,181
Very droll.

160
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:50,140
But there is a real desire
forradical reform in the air.

161
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,065
The Select Committee
on Administrative Affairs,

162
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,746
which I founded,
it's a great success.

163
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,631
Oh, indeed,
what has it achieved?

164
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:03,510
Nothing yet.
But the party's very pleased with it.

165
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,827
Why?

166
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,631
Ten column inches
in last Monday's Daily Mail.

167
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,625
The government measures
its success in column inches?

168
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,703
Yes... no...

169
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,749
Yes and no!

170
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,867
Minister, the evidence
that you are proposing to submit

171
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:26,071
is not only untrue, it is also,
which is much more serious, unwise.

172
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,303
Now, we have been
through all this before.

173
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:30,110
The expansion
of the Civil Service

174
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,388
is the result
of parliamentary legislation,

175
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,543
not bureaucratic empire building.

176
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:38,022
So you want me to tell
Parliament that it's theirfault

177
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,262
that the Civil Service is too big?

178
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:42,866
- But it's the truth.
- I don'twant the truth.

179
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,068
I want something
I can tell Parliament.

180
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,871
Humphrey, you are supposed
to enact my policies.

181
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:52,149
Yet, you seem implacably
opposed to them.

182
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:54,303
I must knowwhere
you stand on all this.

183
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:57,782
Where one stands, Minister,
depends upon where one sits.

184
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:00,347
Am I to infer
that you will not support me?

185
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,070
We will always support you,

186
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,792
but as yourstandardbearer
not as you pall bearer.

187
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,305
What are you saying?

188
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,032
I should have thought
is crystal clear.

189
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,228
Do not send this report to a body

190
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,587
whose recommendations
are to be published!

191
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,663
That is exactly
why I'm sending it.

192
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,345
I don'twant to hearany more.

193
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,470
- May I say just one more thing?
- If it's in plain English.

194
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,985
Very well, Minister.

195
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,902
If you are going to do
this damn silly thing,

196
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,108
don't do it
in this damn silly way.

197
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:31,105
Minister,
you'll be late forCabinet.

198
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,424
Oh, yes. Cabinet.

199
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,509
What are we talking about?

200
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:38,823
Yourproposals to close down
the Land Registry.

201
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,061
My proposal...?

202
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:43,190
Reducing the autonomous
Government Departments.

203
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,343
- Itwas yourproposal.
- You have initialled it.

204
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,709
- Oh, have I? What's in it?
- It'll all go through on the nod.

205
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:50,464
- Got all the stuff?
- Yes.

206
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,623
Come on then,
mustn't be late.

207
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,431
Humpy...

208
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:59,148
Have you written yourevidence
to the Think Tank yet?

209
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,781
- More or less.
- What do you mean?

210
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,943
- The Minister's written it.
- Humpy!

211
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,467
Yes, I know. All very unwise.
But he insisted.

212
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,704
He's been working at nothing else
formore than a week now.

213
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,104
You should never let Ministers
get so deeply involved.

214
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,988
The next thing you know
they'll be dictating policy.

215
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,187
Yes, I know.

216
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:21,025
- Is this a lengthy Cabinet?
- I don't think so.

217
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,904
Ghastly waste of time.

218
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:25,905
Yes, but if we're not here
to hold theirhands,

219
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,791
God knows
what they might not get up to?

220
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,790
Excuse me, Jumbo.
Yes, Minister?

221
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:35,069
I'm recommending to Cabinet
to close down the Land Registry.

222
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,301
- Why?
- Why?

223
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:39,032
Why are we closing it
orbringing it to Cabinet?

224
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:40,307
- What?
- What?

225
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:41,951
Why am I recommending it?

226
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,182
- Surely you know.
- No, that's why I'm asking.

227
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,388
You said itwould go
through on the nod,

228
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,146
now the PM's started
asking questions.

229
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,223
And I haven't read my proposal.

230
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:55,865
There was a 9.75 rise in autonomous
Government Departments.

231
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,909
Yes, of course. Thank you.

232
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,311
I'm sorry, Jumbo...

233
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:08,908
Helping to restrict
the autonomous departments?

234
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,870
That should find favour
with the PM policy-wise.

235
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,032
Oh? Why?

236
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,911
Veryfashionable simplifying
the Civil Service

237
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:18,950
especially with this Think Tank
recommendation.

238
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,388
- But they haven't reported.
- Yes, they have, unofficially...

239
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,543
They haven't taken
all the evidence yet.

240
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:28,307
The Central Policy Review Staff
don't sully theirelevated minds

241
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:30,906
with anything as sordid as evidence.

242
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:33,506
You may take it that
they'll be advising the PM

243
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,981
to simplify the administration
of government.

244
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:39,110
Well, that'll keep me busy.
Ah, well.

245
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,670
I shouldn't count on it.

246
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:46,785
You surely don't expect me,
the PM's Senior Policy Adviser,

247
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,465
to betray confidences.

248
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,907
Not to yourcolleagues, certainly.

249
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:54,064
No doubt the grapevine
would inform you by lunchtime.

250
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,904
Inform?
Inform us of what?

251
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,669
Your Minister is seeking

252
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,630
to reduce overmanning
in the Civil Service.

253
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,623
Well, he's going to get his way.

254
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,022
Treasury, the Home Office
and the Civil Service

255
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:10,504
have all proposed to abolish your
Department of Administrative Affairs

256
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:13,229
and the PM is smiling on the plan.

257
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,860
- That's absurd.
- Clean. Dramatic.

258
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,183
Very popularpolitically.
No real inconvenience.

259
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:23,106
All yourfunctions could be
subsumed by otherdepartments.

260
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:27,629
Jim Hackerwill win through
with a self sacrificing policy.

261
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,101
The PM will probably
kick him upstairs.

262
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:32,428
Lord Hackerof Kamikaze.

263
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:37,902
I hardly think that's funny,
Daniel or likely.

264
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:42,350
Why not? He ran the leadership
campaign against the PM.

265
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:46,664
This could be the PM's masterstroke
in one fell swoop.

266
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,824
Approbation, elevation
and castration.

267
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,544
You know the PM's motto

268
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,590
"In Defeat, malice.
In Victory, revenge".

269
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,263
Abolish my Department.

270
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,785
Out of the question.

271
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:03,949
Simply can't be done.

272
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:06,069
I'm sure you knowbest.

273
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:09,941
By the way, there's a job centre
in the Horseferry Road.

274
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,112
The No. 19 Bus
stops right outside.

275
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,467
- I'm appalled.
- You're appalled?

276
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:19,906
I'm appalled.

277
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:23,661
I just can't believe it.
I'm... I'm appalled.

278
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,547
- What do you make of it?
- I'm appalled, Minister.

279
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,148
So am I. Appalled!

280
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:37,949
It's appalling.

281
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:40,906
Appalling.

282
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:43,461
I just don't know
how to describe it.

283
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,826
Appalling?

284
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:47,028
Appalling.
But I mean is it true?

285
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,910
Sure he wasn't having you on?

286
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:51,188
They can't abolish
this entire department.

287
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,990
It rings true, doesn't it?

288
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,382
I've just see the joint
departmental proposal.

289
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,429
Whitehall's full of proposals.

290
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,867
Daniel Hughes
is very close to the PM.

291
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,671
What's going to happen?
Where will I go?

292
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,346
Well, there is a rumour,
Minister...

293
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:07,265
Rumour? What rumour?

294
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:10,949
Ministerwith responsibility
forlndustrial Harmony.

295
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,909
Industrial harmony?

296
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,306
You knowwhat that means.
That means strikes!

297
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:20,670
Every strike in Great Britain
will be myfault.

298
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:22,460
Oh, marvellous.

299
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,668
Have you considered
what might happen to me?

300
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:28,348
- No. What?
- I shall be sent to Ag and Fish.

301
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:32,910
The rest of my careerdedicated
to arguing about the cod quota.

302
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:34,785
And as foryou, Bernard,

303
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:38,945
if your Ministerbites the dust
yourreputation as a high flyer

304
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,704
will be hit forsix.

305
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:43,065
You'll spend yourcareer

306
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:45,587
in the Vehicle Licensing Centre
in Swansea.

307
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,382
- It's yourfault.
- Myfault?

308
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:53,624
Itwas yourproposal to reduce
the autonomous departments.

309
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,864
You proposed phased reductions
of the Civil Service.

310
00:15:57,032 --> 00:16:00,342
Don't let's argue about that.
What are we going to do?

311
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,350
We could put a paperup.

312
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,466
Up what?

313
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,145
- Brilliant!
- Have you any suggestions?

314
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:17,260
- I don't know, I'm...
- Appalled?

315
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:22,109
I do think thatwe should work
togetheron this.

316
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,342
- I've heard that before.
- What do you mean?

317
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:27,185
You telling me what to do,
me doing it.

318
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,547
- That isn't true.
- You've no suggestions?

319
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,067
Bernard could fetch
your Political Adviser.

320
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,668
- You want me to consult Frank?
- Yes, Minister.

321
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,148
And Minister, with respect...

322
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,110
Don't use that language to me,
Humphrey.

323
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:43,866
- What language?
- I knowwhat "with respect" means.

324
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:46,990
That anything I suggest
is beneath contempt.

325
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,790
Ah, Minister.

326
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:51,307
I really do mean
thatwe should work together.

327
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,506
- I need you.
- Do you mean that?

328
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:59,781
- Yes, Minister.
- Humphrey, how very nice of you.

329
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:04,223
Minister, if the Prime Minister
is behind a scheme,

330
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,508
Whitehall on its own
cannot block it.

331
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:11,543
Cabinet Ministers' schemes
are easily blocked... redrafted,

332
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,822
but the Prime Minister
is anothermatter.

333
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,745
We need to fight this
in Westminsterand in Whitehall.

334
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,870
And Weisel might be able
to mobilise the backbenchers.

335
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:23,627
Yes. And he might be able
to mobilise the Press.

336
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:26,347
- You've heard the news?
- Bernard just told me.

337
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,070
What do you suggest?

338
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,750
I can't think of anything...
I'm appalled.

339
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,187
Mustn't all flap around
like a lot of wet hens.

340
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:38,582
We've got to save
this Department.

341
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,902
I want you to get
to the backbenchers

342
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,870
to put a stop to this thing
before it starts.

343
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:48,071
I'm sorry, but you can't stop
something before it starts.

344
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:49,950
Thank you. Frank...

345
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:55,231
Itwon't be that easy.
Itwill be a very popularmove.

346
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:57,269
A publicity campaign?
You know:

347
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,992
"Administration Saves the Nation"
"Red Tape is Fun".

348
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,268
Full page ads in...

349
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:05,265
Itwas just an idea.

350
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,070
"Red Tape is fun"?

351
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:11,264
What about "Red Tape holds
the Nation together"?

352
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:18,784
Well, there's no doubt about it,
the writing's on the wall.

353
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,668
The public should think kindly
towards Administration,

354
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,221
- because of the Europass.
- Quite.

355
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,826
- Europass?
- European Identity Card.

356
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,509
You've informed the Minister?

357
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,264
Didn't you do yourboxes?

358
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:35,026
No, I was redrafting
the redraft of the draft.

359
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,622
Well, Brussels is about to decree

360
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,352
that there is to be a new
European Identity Card

361
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:43,663
to be carried
by all citizens of the E. E. C.

362
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,266
The Foreign Office
is ready to go along with it

363
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,390
as a quid pro quo fora deal
overthe buttermountain,

364
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,861
the wine lake,
and the milk ocean,

365
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,067
the lamb war,
and the cod stink.

366
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:00,701
And the Prime Ministerwants you
to introduce the legislation.

367
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,100
- Me?
- Yes.

368
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:04,183
You're pro Europe, you see.

369
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:07,021
And itwould simplify
ouradministration.

370
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,467
- So it's a good idea.
- Good idea?

371
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,509
- Good idea?
- Good idea?

372
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,261
- Not a good idea?
- Political suicide!

373
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:18,141
Trying to make British people
carry Identification Papers?

374
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,064
They'll call it a Police State.

375
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,985
Is this whatwe fought
two world wars for?

376
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:25,985
It's little more than a sort
of driving licence.

377
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,108
It's the last nail in my coffin.

378
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,866
You might get away
with calling it "Euroclub Express".

379
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,102
Bernard,
eithershut up orget out!

380
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,944
Can't the Foreign Office
introduce it?

381
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,580
Thatwas the Prime Minister's
suggestion,

382
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:43,903
but forthe Foreign Secretary
itwas a Home Office matter

383
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:46,540
and forthe Home Office
itwas essentially

384
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,907
and administrative matter,
and the PM agreed.

385
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:50,471
Pass the parcel.

386
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:53,226
Can you blame them
when you can hear it ticking?

387
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:57,350
The identity card bill
is planned to be

388
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:00,106
the last action
of this Department.

389
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,422
Wonderful ammunition
forthe anti Europeans.

390
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:06,221
Don't the Foreign Office realise
the damage to the European idea?

391
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:08,508
That's why they support it.

392
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,872
The Foreign Office is pro Europe,
isn't it?

393
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,788
Yes and no...
if you'll forgive the expression.

394
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:20,225
The Foreign Office is pro Europe
because it is really anti Europe.

395
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:24,024
The Civil Service was united
in its desire to make sure

396
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,342
that the Common Market
didn'twork.

397
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,984
- That's why we went into it.
- What are you talking about?

398
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:34,111
Minister, Britain has had
the same foreign policy objective

399
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,627
forat least the last 500 years:

400
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,428
To create a disunited Europe.

401
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:43,231
We have foughtwith the Dutch
against the Spanish,

402
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,952
with the Germans
against the French

403
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,149
and with the French against
the Germans and the Italians.

404
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,143
Divide and rule, you see.

405
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:54,827
Why should we change now,
when it's worked so well?

406
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,267
That's all ancient history surely?

407
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,388
Yes, and current policy.

408
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:03,911
We had to break the whole thing up,
so we had to get inside.

409
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,950
We tried from the outside,
but itwouldn'twork.

410
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:11,623
Now, we can make a complete
pig's breakfast of the whole thing.

411
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,587
Set the Germans
against the French,

412
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,027
the Italians against the Dutch...

413
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:21,344
The Foreign Office is terribly
pleased, it's just like old times.

414
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:25,144
Butwe're all committed
to the European ideal.

415
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:27,348
Really, Minister.

416
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:31,111
Why are we pressing
foran increase in the membership?

417
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,708
Forthe same reason.
It's just like the United Nations.

418
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:38,023
The more members it has,
the more arguments it can stirup,

419
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,547
the more futile
and impotent it becomes.

420
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:43,341
- What appalling cynicism.
- Yes.

421
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:46,068
We call it diplomacy, Minister.

422
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,148
Howwill the othercountries
feel about identity papers?

423
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:51,665
Won't they resist too?

424
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:54,790
The Germans will love it,
the French will ignore it,

425
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:58,501
and the Italians and the Irish
will be too chaotic to enforce it.

426
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,107
Only the British will resent it.

427
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:05,425
- It's a plot to get rid of me.
- They'll abolish your Department.

428
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,106
Perhaps the PM wants
to make absolutely certain.

429
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:11,901
- Don't be so paranoid.
- Everyone is plotting against me.

430
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:15,303
- We're on yourside, Minister.
- Yes, Minister.

431
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:19,381
- Martin will be on ourside.
- Yes, where is Martin?

432
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:23,306
I think he's in the House,
Minister, where you ought to be.

433
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,110
Let's go and see him.

434
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,269
This is appalling, Jim.

435
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,821
- You've done a Samson act.
- Samson?

436
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:35,428
You've reduced
the Civil Service bureaucracy.

437
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:38,948
You've pulled the superstructure
down and buried yourself.

438
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,712
- A Pyrrhic victory.
- No ideas?

439
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:45,069
- I'd help if I could, but...
- But the Europass...

440
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:46,870
It doesn't make sense.

441
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,990
Why can't the PM see
the damage?

442
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:53,542
Yes, this Europass issue
is the biggest disaster

443
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:56,146
since I asked to join the Cabinet.

444
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,951
I don't think you quite mean that.

445
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,945
Everybody knows
this Europass thing won't happen.

446
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:05,946
The PM's got to play along with it
because of the Napoleon Prize.

447
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:07,112
Napoleon Prize?

448
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:10,184
A NATO Award
given once everyfive years.

449
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:12,661
Gold medal,
big ceremony in Brussels.

450
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,982
The PM's the front runnerthis time.

451
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:19,270
It's forthe statesman who has
contributed most to European unity.

452
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,504
Since Napoleon.
That is if you don't count Hitler.

453
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:25,307
So? What...?

454
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:28,145
The awards committee
sits in six weeks.

455
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:31,224
The PM isn't going to rock
the boat until it's in the bag.

456
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,348
You don't put boats in bags.

457
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,628
- What's that Bernard?
- Nothing, Minister.

458
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:39,906
Once the prize is awarded,
the PM will dump the Europasses.

459
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:44,862
Howmany people know about
the winnerof the Napoleon Prize?

460
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,829
- It's top secret.
- You mean everyone.

461
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,109
- No, top secret top secret.
- That's it then.

462
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,103
- Humphrey, don't you see?
- See what?

463
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:55,548
- Backbenchers. Leaks.
- The Welsh Nationalist party?

464
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:56,861
No. No. No.

465
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:01,270
Oh, I'll come back later.

466
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:03,992
No. No.
Don't go, the very man.

467
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,710
Come on in, Daniel.

468
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:09,666
- I want to ask youradvice.
- I'll give any help I can.

469
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:13,541
But if it's about shutting stable
doors afterhorses have bolted,

470
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:15,668
even I am powerless to help.

471
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:18,266
You won't be powerless
in this case.

472
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,344
It's really a sort of moral dilemma.

473
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,901
Supposing a backbencher
were to put down

474
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:27,826
a question forthe Prime Minister,
asking whetherthe Europass...

475
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,711
Which backbencher?
Europass is top secret.

476
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:34,387
You mean like the winner
of the Napoleon Prize is top secret?

477
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:37,225
The Ministermeant
a hypothetical backbencher.

478
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,223
Quite so, Bernard.
Thank you.

479
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,383
A hypothetical backbencher.

480
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,270
And a hypothetical question

481
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:47,027
asking whetherornot Britain
was going to adopt the Europass.

482
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:50,987
- Highly improbable.
- Oh, I agree. Highly improbable.

483
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:53,666
But suppose the PM
were to answeryes,

484
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,511
itwould be very damaging
in the country?

485
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,427
Yes.

486
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,429
And if the PM
were to answerno

487
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:02,981
itwould be very damaging
in Europe?

488
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:05,548
To the PM personally.

489
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:08,741
Napoleon prize- wise.

490
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:13,384
Now, if a hypothetical Minister
were to get to hear

491
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:17,340
of this hypothetical question
in advance, what should he do?

492
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,627
The only course
would be to ensure

493
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,987
that the question
was not tabled.

494
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,985
Serious business,
suppressing an MP's question.

495
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,790
There is no othercourse.

496
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:31,668
The only way to stop him
might be to get him

497
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:35,029
to put down a question asking
the Prime Minister

498
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,065
to squash the rumours
about the closure

499
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,185
of the Department
forAdministrative Affairs.

500
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,704
Oh, but I'm sure...
whatevermade you think...

501
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:48,182
anything but the fullest support...

502
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:52,584
You said that a plan to abolish
the Department had been put up,

503
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,743
and the PM was smiling on it.

504
00:25:54,912 --> 00:25:57,472
No, smiling at it!
Smiling at it, not on it.

505
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:01,387
The whole idea was ridiculous.

506
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,986
Laughable.
Out of the question.

507
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,586
Ajoke.

508
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:07,021
Ajoke?

509
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,911
You didn't imagine...

510
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:13,668
So that a minute from the Prime
Minister's office confirming this,

511
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:17,825
and squashing the rumour,
will be circulated to all departments

512
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:19,584
within 24 hours.

513
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:23,985
So thatwe can all share it,
joke- wise I mean!

514
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,827
Do you really think it's necessary?

515
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,306
Yes.

516
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:33,625
Well, I'm sure something
can be arranged.

517
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,271
If you'll excuse me.

518
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:37,071
Checkmate, I think.

519
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,629
Game, set and match.

520
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,464
Can Daniel Hughes fix this?

521
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:43,907
Don't Prime Ministers
have minds of theirown?

522
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:45,267
Certainly.

523
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:48,424
But as President Nixon's
henchmen once said:

524
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:53,746
"When you've got them by the balls,
theirhearts and minds will follow".

525
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,710
Isn't that right?

526
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:58,225
Yes, Minister.
