00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:02,993
Here you go.

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,728
And I hope you enjoyed
dinner and the show.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,323
The show being me pretending
I'm happy as a waitress.

4
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,133
Caroline, where is Max?

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,936
And I've already checked
the bowels of hell.

6
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:15,342
Yeah, I know where I work.

7
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,341
Max is going to be late today

8
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,475
'cause she got stuck on the subway.

9
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,776
But you said yesterday she was late

10
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:21,912
because she was stuck on the subway.

11
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:26,483
No, I believe I said yesterday
she got stuck under the subway.

12
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,318
Oleg, a little help.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,586
Oh, Max?

14
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,555
Today she got stuck on a bus.

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:34,958
And you said that the
day before yesterday.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,093
- Earl?
- She got stuck between the moon

17
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:39,729
and New York City.

18
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,943
I know it's crazy, but it's true.

19
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:44,868
Sorry I'm late.

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,770
I couldn't find our cat, Nancy.

21
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,751
Also, I was stuck on the
bus or under the subway.

22
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:51,775
Unless they told you
something different,

23
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,810
then I was doing that.

24
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,313
Oh, come on. That excuse
was less satisfying

25
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,449
than the end of<i> Serial.</i>

26
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:01,351
Max, really, what do you take me for?

27
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,486
Well, I know where I can't take you.

28
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,235
On the big rides at Disneyland.

29
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,325
Nancy still hasn't come home.

30
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,393
I'm freaking out.

31
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,895
She's the only thing I love.

33
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,839
Whatever.

34
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,467
I had a cat once. He was cool.

35
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,337
He was black and very sexually active.

36
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:26,075
Oh, wait, the cool cat
I'm talking about was me.

37
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:29,178
Earl, be careful, at your age,
you could die having sex.

38
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,913
I know.

39
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,196
Those ladies don't know
whether I'm coming or going.

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,755
I think Nancy might be gone for good.

45
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,448
I just can't believe she
didn't take me with her.

46
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,857
We had a deal.

47
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,525
Max, she'll come back to the apartment,

48
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,160
even if she doesn't want to.

You call her "that cat."

53
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,672
As in, "that cat" peed on my pillow.

While I was sleeping on it, Max.

55
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:20,980
Well, blame me. I got her drunk.

Look, girls, I got your

That's not Nancy.

That is a boy.

Well, Max, sorry I don't
check out a cat's junk

69
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,950
the second it comes through the door.

That's the difference
between you and me.

See, look, the name tag says "Cinnamon."

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,261
No wonder that little girl
kept crying and saying,

74
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:12,264
"Give me Cinnamon, Give me Cinnamon."

75
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,000
I looked her right in
the eye and I said,

00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:19,271
"I don't carry spices in my purse."

77
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,540
Max, you are completely overreacting.

- It's just a...
- Oh! Just a what?

89
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,898
to make room for those
1,600 cupcake T-shirts

about those T-shirts?

But I know our cat's name.

108
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,676
and you spent money on new kitty litter?

109
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:35,613
Relax, I'm going to pee in it, too.

110
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,415

you've been using in your bedroom.

112
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,951
It's just such a long
walk to the bathroom

00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,520
that every time I have to go,

114
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,922
it's like I'm raising money for MS.

00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,358
Oh, I have good news.

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,096
I found your lost bra in the litter box.

117
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:53,631
Don't think I'm not still wearing it.

118
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:54,599
I mean, why not?

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,868
I ate a hot dog that rolled
under a car the other day.

120
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,270
I left a couple of big clumps in,

121
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,906

don't know why she wanted it,

00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,585
Yeah, I don't need 1,000 pink T-shirts.

How do you get this thing open?

145
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,158
We usually just take Nancy around

146
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,094
in an old vacuum cleaner bag.

147
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:00,764
Also doubles as my "going out" purse.

149
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,634

no discarded heroin needles?

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,577

00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,446

Here, let me help.

156
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:19,817
I mean, I'm the dumb one who
paid $2,000 for a cat carrier.

157
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,385
Hmm. I miss being that stupid.

158
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,087
You know, my cat can't
get this open either.

159
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,656
It must be the lack of thumbs.

160

You know, my cat,
Dickens, loves your cat.

163
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:36,733
Oh, Dickens, after the author?

164
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,736
Dickens, after the author, Max.

165
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,771
Yeah, I know who that is.

166
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:45,675
The guy who wrote
<i>Muppets Christmas Carol.</i>

167
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,877
There. I knew I'd get it.

168
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,313
'Cause I have thumbs.

- [cat meows]
- Yes.

171
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,519
So I take it by the cat, you're single?

172
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,390
Big time.

173
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,960
So, do you and Dickens live alone?

174
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,262
Oh no, she's trying to flirt.

175
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:07,630
I travel a lot for work.

176
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:08,731
I'm a venture capitalist.

177
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,732
So you know how it is.

178
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, I do. I absolutely do.

179
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,235
- I...
- Here it comes.

180
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:14,370
- Went to Wharton.
- Boom.

181
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,653
Well, if she gets lost again,
you know where to find her.

182
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,174
She's been hanging around
outside our window

183
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,575
every day for the last couple of months.

184
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,544
So I let her in. I hope that's okay.

185
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,480
Is that okay? It's awesome.

186
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,715
I hope your girlfriend didn't mind.

187
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:27,783
We just broke up.

188
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:28,884
So I'm single.

189
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,052
And I better get going.

190
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,054
I've got a 10:00 meeting.

191
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:32,054
Max, give the man his case.

192
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,523
He has a 10:00 meeting.

193
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,225
She doesn't want to get
out of cushy this thing.

194
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,546
I totally get it.

195
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:38,961
I had to be dragged out
of that massage chair

196
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,263
at Brookstone by mall security.

197
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,032
Well, here's my card, just give me a call

198
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,300
when you want me to pick up the case.

199
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:47,236
You have a card?

200
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,938
A card, a meeting, a suit, a joke?

201
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,275
Are you the next bachelor?

202
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:55,311
Well, thank you, Owen Charles Boyd,

203
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,079
for bringing back our beloved...

204
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,647
- Her name's Nancy!
- I know her name.

205
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,617
Why do I have to say it so fast?

206
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,087
She's joking, she's just
not as funny as you.

207
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,455
Well, it was nice to meet you.

208
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,323
Bye, Nancy.

209
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:09,491
Okay.

210
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:16,665
Yes, I was flirting.

211
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,267
But I was doing it for our business.

212
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,503
You should really be doing
it for your business.

213
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:24,339
'Cause your business is
going out of business.

214
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,640
He has a card.

215
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,010
And it's not for medical marijuana.

216
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,177
He's a venture capitalist.

217
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,278
That's the kind of fat cat

218
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,147
that can help us get back on our feet.

219
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,715
Speaking of fat cats,
Nancy's looking like

220
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,918
she might need to give Jenny a call.

221
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,286
Hey, girls.

222
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,456
Oh, you found Nancy.

223
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,060
I knew she'd come back pregnant.

224
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:46,695
Wait, Sophie, how can
you tell she's pregnant

225
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,332
and just not fighting the same
battle Jonah Hill is fighting?

226
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:54,035
Well, her fur is thicker, she's
got a little sparkle in her eye,

227
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,871
and there's a little kitten head
about to pop out of her patoot.

228
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:08,155
[Nancy meowing]

229
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,183
Come on. Push, Nancy.

230
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,918
Come on, we all know what you did.

231
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,126
Now is not the time to be shy.

232
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,724
You do know what you're
doing, right, Sophie?

233
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,126
This isn't like the time you told us

234
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,595
you could do your own
bikini wax with a candle?

235
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,132
'Cause I still have the
vanilla-scented scars from that.

236
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,801
Don't worry.

237
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,503
In my village, all the Kuchenskis women

238
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,172
acted as animal midwives.

239
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,808
It was the best way to meet guys.

240
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,443
Strap in, girls.

241
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,479
- [Nancy meowing]
- Ah! She's crowning!

242
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,114
I can't believe it.

243
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,483
I thought Nancy was smarter than this.

244
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:46,131
But it turns out she's just
like the rest of the women

245
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,219
in my family.

246
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,858
Screwed by some stranger
she met in the dumpster.

247
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,925
Okay, here we go.

248
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,293
[Nancy meowing]

249
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,780
Oh, there goes my ring.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,734
I... sorry, Nancy.

251
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,402
(Sophie) Oh, here we go!

252
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:09,007
Come on, girls, I need some
hot water and fresh towels.

253
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,942
We do, too. For, like, four years.

254
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,811
Uh...

255
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,112
how about some of these T-shirts?

256
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,014
Oh, sure why not use those?

257
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,415
They used to be our bright future.

258
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,937
Now just a ShamWow
for illegitimate cats.

259
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,055
[Nancy meowing]

260
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,957
Oh, my God, that must be the sound

261
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,561
of a surrendering cat uterus.

262
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,238
Well, it's the first time
a uterus has surrendered

263
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,393
in that bed in a while.

264
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,335
[kittens meowing]

265
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,003
I don't know why I'm not throwing up.

266
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,907
Oh, wait. I'm starting to.

267
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,375
[kittens continue meowing]

268
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,113
Well, I'm off Korean dumplings for life.

269
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,815
This one... this one won't come out.

270
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,118
It's like the Queen Latifah of kittens.

271
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,926
Sophie, I got your text that
you were in bed with Nancy.

272
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,294
Who is this Nancy,

273
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,864
and when did we go back
to doing three-ways?

274
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,300
Nancy's a cat.

275
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,335
Mm, that's a no.

276
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,038
I've got to draw the line somewhere.

277
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,413
Well, I heard the news.

278
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,951
Looks like you two are
grandmothers before you're 30.

279
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:30,821
Can't say I'm surprised.

280
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,757
Okay, before you even ask,

281
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,259
I don't pay for cat maternity leave.

282
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,396
This isn't Google.

283
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,763
This isn't even Ask Jeeves, Han.

284
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,803
Well, I can help you get
the kittens good homes.

285
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,239
The people in my building are very nice.

286
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,709
Except if you don't recycle one
bottle of sparkling cider,

287
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,512
then nobody talks to
you in the elevator.

288
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,714
Han, we're not giving the kittens away.

289
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,582
Nancy landed herself a rich cat,

290
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,186
we're gonna be living off
a hefty kitty support.

291
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,987
Only you two would be desperate enough

292
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,522
to try and find a sugar catty.

293
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,726
So has Owen called you back yet?

294
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,595
Um, we're trading.

295
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,963
"We're trading"?

296
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,832
"We're trading" is
lonely white girl talk

297
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,101
for "he hasn't called me back."

298
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,336
I can't believe this.
He's a deadbeat dad.

299
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,205
Max, he's just busy.

300
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,073
And I think you might
be projecting a little

301
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,274
because of your dad.

302
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,576
Not that I'm a therapist.

303
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,678
I mean, I can't even afford a couch.

304
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,146
I'm not projecting.

305
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,849
I just know a deadbeat dad
when I don't see one!

306
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,884
Where's his card?

307
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,218
I don't remember where I...

308
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,554
[gasps] Max, let go! I've got this.

309
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,322
That guy can really help
us with our business.

310
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,258
Please, let me handle this.

311
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,225
Look, Ryan Gosling.

312
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,694

313
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,862
- I got this.
- I got this.

314
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,330
- I got this.
- I got this.

315
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,588
Keep going, girls, I'm almost there.

316
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:52,736
I got this, Max.

317
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,571
And when he comes to
get the cat carrier,

318
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,605
I'll talk to him.

319
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,973
You're way too emotional.

320
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,535
You just went to third
base with my apron.

321
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,716
Sitting on this stoop is nice.

322
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,551
How come we never sit out here?

323
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,719
[gunshots ringing]

[woman shrieking]

325
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,257
There it is.

326
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,819
Oh, please, it's just Rico.

327
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,899
Rico looks good. I think
he got another tattoo.

328
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,768
Look, when Owen gets here,
should we still be alive,

329
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,170
please let me do the talking.

330
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,806
Kittens aside, Owen can help us.

331
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,541
A venture capitalist buys companies

332
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,842
and turns them around.

333
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,311
Yeah, I've seen <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

334
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,980
That's how I realized I
wasn't charging enough.

335
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,749
Go, Max, here he comes.

336
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,585
All right, but I'll be watching
inside from the window.

337
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,203
It's probably better, because
I don't trust Nancy alone

338
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:44,954
with those kittens.

339
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:46,589
She's got some serious postpartum.

340
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,591
When I left the room, she
was lighting a Menthol 100

341
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,676
with a shaky paw.

342
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,763
Hi.

343
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,965
Crazy we live walking
distance from each other.

344
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,633
We don't. The Uber driver

345
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,936
wouldn't go past the fire
hydrant on the corner.

346
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,662
The one with the bloody
shoe hanging from it?

347
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,972
That's the one.

348
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,941
[woman screaming]

349
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,976
You know what? I'm just
gonna take the cat carrier.

350
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,232
Before you go...

351
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,882
we have this small cupcake company

352
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,550
that's just begging to be an empire,

353
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,586
and I wanted to pick your brain
about some business stuff.

354
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,928
Okay, so your Dickens
got our cat pregnant,

355
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,264
and she just had five kittens.

356
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,999
And at her age, it's a miracle
we didn't have to pay

357
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,700
for in vitro.

358
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,202
How do you know they are Dickens's?

359
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,770
I'm not saying that Nancy's easy,

360
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,071
it's just, I've seen her go in and out

361
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,275
of a lot of windows.

362
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:42,344
[police sirens blaring in the distance]

363
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,279
Did he just drop a gun?

364
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,515
It's fine. He has more.

365
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,117
Okay, call my assistant,
you can pick my brain.

366
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,820
I just don't want it
to be off the sidewalk.

367
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,389
Really, I got to go. I can't get killed.

368
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,191
I'm wearing new suede loafers.

369
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,760
Uber, an assistant, and suede loafers?

370
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,062
Are you for real?

371
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,475
I hope I'm not intruding.

372
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,676
No, come in.

373
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,244
I was just brushing my new loafers.

374
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,480
I bought them as a
break-up gift for myself.

375
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:17,788
But unlike my ex-girlfriend,
these have a sole.

376
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,086
I didn't wanna mention the cat
situation to your assistant.

377
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,055
Next thing you know, it's
all over the lunch room:

378
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:26,913
Owen Charles Boyd's cat is a raw-dogger.

379
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,962
Said it was an accident.

380
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,129
Didn't feel like one.

381
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,998
One shoe yes, but both?

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,133
Highly unlikely.

383
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,470
Owen, sometimes in life, it's
not just an innocent cat

384
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,771
that gets screwed.

385
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,008
A girl can get screwed as well.

386
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,218
Oh, hey, hi. What's happening?

387
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,481
As in, screwed by one
bad business decision.

388
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,616
My partner, Max, and I recently invested

389
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,720
all our savings in...
well, here, take a look.

390
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,155
- [gasps]
- Oh, my coffee!

391
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,323
- Oh.
- My loafer!

392
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,926
My coffee's on my loafer!

393
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,961
Here, let me.

394
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,129
No, you dab. You don't wipe suede.

395
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,297
You dab.

396
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,132
Dab. Dab. I'm sorry.

397
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,266
I used to know that.

398
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,568
That's Rich 101.

399
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,936
Let me just go find some water

400
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,273
and I'll dab, not wipe, this out.

401
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,808
We're not done yet. I'm going back in.

402
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,068
It's going really well though.

403
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,078
Where's water?

404
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,014
Do you know how to unsend an email?

405
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,116
If I did, my rich ex-boyfriend
would've never found out

406
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,252
what I thought of his lisp

407
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,288
and I'd be living in the
"thouth of Franth" right now.

408
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,557
[elevator bell dings]

409
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,825
Where is he?

410
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,561
He needs to see these adorable bastards.

411
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,129
Max, how did you find me here?

412
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,098
I told you I was going
on a "think walk."

413
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,166
I followed you.

414
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,043
I never noticed how much
you check yourself out

415
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,537
in store windows. You have a problem.

416
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,573
Do either of you know a
way to turn the phrase,

417
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,758
"self-absorbed, ridiculous pig"
into a compliment?

418
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,913
If I did, I'd still be
on<i> The Apprentice.</i>

419
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,148
Owen's going to see that email

420
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,483
and I'm going to get fired.

421
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,838
I have to start paying
attention to details.

422
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,354
I'm just gonna go back in.

423
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,690
What? I don't care.

424
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,757
Not without me you're not.

425
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,619
Max, please, let me handle this.

426
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,627
I'm begging you.

427
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,730
We're getting close, look,
I'm holding his shoe.

428
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,298
If he doesn't step up here,

429
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,766
these kittens will feel neglected,

430
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,268
and it is only a matter of time

431
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,136
till they are waitressing or worse.

432
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,771
Max, you're wrong.

433
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,507
There's nothing worse than waitressing.

434
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,909
Max, stop!

435
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:25,876
You'll ruin everything.

436
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,578
I can fix this and us.

437
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,880
We are beyond help.

438
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,448
It's all about these kittens.

- No, I got this.

- I...
- [gasps]

Oh, my God.

[kittens meowing]

445
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,628
That's right. I came to your
office with a basket of cats.

446
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,397
Max, I'm so sorry.

447
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,932
Yeah, well, he's the one
who should be sorry.

00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,604
I want you to look these
kittens in the whiskers

449
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,840
and tell them that Dickens
is not their father.

450

What makes you think they're mine. Why?

451
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,044
Because they look just like Dickens

452
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,847
when he was a tiny baby kitten.

453
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,882
Oh, and this one's even cuter.

454
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,084
And that one.

455
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,785
I'll take them all.

456
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,574
But not that one. Seems a little off.

457
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:12,789
Not quite as alert as the others.

458
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,026
Oh, she's not good enough for you?

459
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,928
- Max. Projecting.
- I'm not projecting.

460
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,588
He said she's not good enough for him.

461
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:20,664
What?

462
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,934
Just because she was unplanned
and not good at math?

Caroline, are we gonna hook up or what?

467
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,143
This is, like the
weirdest foreplay ever.

468
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,645
Hook up? What would make you
think I want to hook up?

469
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,148
Oh, because I business flirted?

470
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,716
That's Wharton 101.

471
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,584
It was more than business flirting.

472
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,786
You begged to come to my office,

473
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,188
show up wearing a see-through shirt.

474
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,323
That was not by choice.

475
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,191
It is cheaply made.

476
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,926
I came here to talk to you
about our business,

477
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,762
and possibly get you to invest
in a small, but spirited...

478
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,565
Invest? This is the financial
capital of the world.

00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,634
[baby talk] Yes, it is.

480
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,436

desperate little cupcake shop?

Thanks for taking the kittens, Han.

Unlike all my non-animal children,

I want to know they're taken care of.

don't you understand?

Sounds about right.

00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,506
These two should try and stay together.

what humping looks like.

This one's pretty bland.

516
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,623
She lays around, doesn't meow much,

517
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,392
and when she does, she's
kind of phoning it in.

518
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,361
We call her Amy Adams.

519
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,543
Yep.

she's got potential.
