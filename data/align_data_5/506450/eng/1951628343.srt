1
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,389
When I returned
to Baker Street

2
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,625
from a short holiday
in the spring of 1891,

3
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,196
I had seen little of Holmes
for some time.

4
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,778
I saw in the papers
that he had been engaged

5
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,315
by the French government upon
a matter of supreme importance

6
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,117
but I could hardly foresee
that it would have

7
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,386
so violent
a consequence.

8
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,656
It lies with me now
to tell for the first time

9
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,227
what took place between
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

10
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,832
and Professor Moriarity
in that fateful year.

11
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:23,203
Ah, Mrs. Hudson
has Mr. Holmes returned?

12
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,072
Oh, he has indeed.

13
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,406
He came in early.

14
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,442
Must have been
before 7:00.

15
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,244
"Morning Mrs. Hudson"
he says,

16
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,713
"Have you anything nice
for my breakfast?"

17
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,148
as if he hadn't been away
for four months.

18
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,385
You could have knocked me down
with a feather.

19
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,154
And he's gone
out again I take it?

20
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,892
Yes, yes he had his breakfast
and then he went out again

21
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,361
just after
his visitor left.

22
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,930
Visitor?

23
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,200
An elderly
gentleman.

24
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,969
They had words.

25
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,507
I didn't like the look of him,
not at all I didn't.

26
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,877
He had a face like, like
the wrath of God

27
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,313
or should I say
the devil.

28
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,048
Indeed.

29
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,485
Should we open a bottle
of the best claret

30
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,188
to celebrate
Mr. Holmes' return?

31
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,956
Why not?

32
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,591
Very good.

33
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,028
Thank you,
Mrs. Hudson.

34
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,398
I learned later that Holmes
had survived three attempts

35
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,767
on his life
that very day.

36
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,303
But as I waited for him
to reappear

37
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:33,841
Baker Street looked to me
as safe and secure as ever.

38
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,161
Holmes you...

39
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,998
Wait, wait.

40
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,014
What is it?

41
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:51,451
Air guns, a rather special
air gun in fact.

42
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,223
Watson would you have
any objection to drawing

43
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,993
the blinds casually as if
you were alone in this room?

44
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,785
Watson I think you know me
well enough to understand

45
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,855
that I am by no means
a nervous man.

46
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,692
But it is stupidity
rather than courage

47
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,295
to refuse to recognize danger
when it is close upon you.

48
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,138
Damn!

49
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,979
Watson,
might I have a match?

50
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,684
Holmes,
you're hurt.

51
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,786
Scratches, nothing,
nothing to signify.

52
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,563
You don't look well
Holmes.

53
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:15,102
Well I have been using myself
rather too freely.

54
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,971
I have been somewhat
pressed but late.

55
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,440
How pressed?

56
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,810
Well as I am unable to leave
this room until after dark

57
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,747
and then most likely
on the way that I came,

58
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,583
we do have some time
on our hands.

59
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,921
Also I owe you an explanation
for my unceremonious departure

60
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,156
the last time
that we met.

61
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,358
I'll take some notes
if I may?

62
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,394
Oh, by all means.

63
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,229
This case...

64
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,299
This case,
it is unique

65
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,369
in the annuals
of crime.

66
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,442
You will recall that it was
a cold morning early in the year

67
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,211
when I last left
Baker Street.

68
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,317
I had no idea where I was going
or who my client was.

69
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,918
All I knew was
that it was important

70
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,320
and abroad.

71
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,157
My destination was the museum
and the Louve was in Paris

72
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:14,228
and my client none less
than the French government.

73
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:27,274
Surely this Louve is near
to the very heart of France.

74
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,844
It was here that
the great Musele held court

75
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,547
and here that
Napoleon Bonaparte

76
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,716
was married to
the Archduchess Madam

77
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,584
Marie Louise of Austria.

78
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,255
Indeed it is a history lesson
in stone.

79
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,358
And now this gallery
contains our finest paintings.

80
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,862
Gentlemen,
shall we come to the point?

81
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,866
I presume the Mona Lisa
has been stolen.

82
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,307
When I see two hooks
and the place where

83
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,076
the Mona Lisa used to hang
and then this talk

84
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,213
of...
and scandal.

85
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,787
Yes, now I begin to understand
the delicacy of the matter.

86
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,661
The Louve is closed on Mondays
for maintenance.

87
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,963
The fact that the Mona Lisa
was not hanging

88
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,032
in her usual place was no doubt
due to the fact

89
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,501
that she was in
the photographic studio.

90
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,938
It was only later in the day
that a workman found the frame

91
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:36,109
in a little storeroom
under the salon care.

92
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,711
We put the glass
over the painting

93
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,213
only a month ago.

94
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,781
We feared an acid attack,
there was such a one

95
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,182
in Florence recently.

96
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,483
How very fortunate.

97
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,351
Pardon?

98
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,353
Two good
thumb prints.

99
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,898
Many artists come here
to make copies of the paintings.

100
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,772
This one seems
well done.

101
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,442
Yes, that artist
is particularly clever

102
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,944
and makes a good living
from his copying.

103
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,980
I should like
to meet him sometime.

104
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,568
To make a bad copy
is very easy but a good one,

105
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,704
it takes
years of practice.

106
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,040
For instance De Vinci

107
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,011
used Italian popular wood
to paint on.

108
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,713
It is very difficult
to find.

109
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,217
To match the original color,
nearly impossible.

110
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,754
It is, uh, full mature,
the smooth blended tones,

111
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,691
very subtle
and his brushwork

112
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,860
is left-handed.

113
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,964
The crack work,
this fine network

114
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:09,403
of cracks,
left, ah.

115
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,672
that is the most difficult
to achieve of all.

116
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,507
And you can
achieve it?

117
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,808
How?

118
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,477
That is my secret.

119
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,280
It seems to me
that this is something

120
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,549
near to a
legitimate forgery.

121
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,052
No, no, no
because the copies must never

122
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,287
be the same size
as the original.

123
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,023
And, and who would buy
one of my copies as the original

124
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,093
when the real Mona Lisa
is in the Louve.

125
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,661
But if by chance
the Mona Lisa

126
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,730
is no longer
in the Louve?

127
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,299
But of course
you are joking Messier.

128
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,310
Happily the French police
are well ahead of the British

129
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,613
when it comes to
fingerprints.

130
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,883
The great Bantion himself
was kind enough to refer

131
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,253
to my little pamphlet
on the subject as his bible.

132
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,489
As I suspected,
our man had been involved

133
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,760
in petty crime in the past,
a Spaniard named Mendosa.

134
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,330
There, there
is your thief.

135
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,200
Not a pleasant
specimen.

136
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,204
Mr. Holmes,
France owes you a great debt.

137
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,673
We have not got the man
and more important,

138
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,942
the painting.

139
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,111
But he must
be arrested immediately.

140
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,046
He may have already
sold it.

141
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,915
No, no, gentlemen
it is my belief

142
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,317
that the painting
is still in Mendosa's keeping.

143
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,387
He is only a pawn
in a much bigger game.

144
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,290
This robbery
has been carefully planned

145
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,593
over months, even years
by a master criminal.

146
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,562
But what professional
criminal would want

147
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,363
to own
the Mona Lisa?

148
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,431
That is madness.

149
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,933
He can't sell it.

150
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,569
I believe the master criminal
is not interested

151
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,736
in the original,

152
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,208
if he can pass off
the forgeries as originals

153
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,210
for the same price.

154
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,280
Gentlemen we must
alarm Mendosa,

155
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:04,017
get him on the move
so he leads us

156
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,153
to the center
of the web.

157
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,754
But how?

158
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,924
First we must announce
to the world

159
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,293
that the painting
has been stolen.

160
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,895
Oh,
but that would create

161
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,464
a great scandal both myself
and the director of...

162
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,566
Minister,
please if I may explain.

163
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,169
It would be announced
that owing to the brilliant

164
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,340
and tireless efforts of
yourself and the director,

165
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,177
that the criminal
is about to be arrested.

166
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,395
Mr. Holmes, we must
arrest him now.

167
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,030
No.

168
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,971
Now!

169
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,746
Holmes, I understand that
the recovery of the original

170
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,416
would make it impossible
for the thieves to sell

171
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,252
any copies however excellent
those copies were,

172
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,589
but did you have any clue
to the identity

173
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,691
of the mastermind behind
the whole scheme?

174
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,193
I was satisfied
that I had recognized one of

175
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,829
Professor Moriarity's
agents.

176
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,631
Moriarity?

177
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:25,092
Notice the subtle modeling
of the features,

178
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,394
beautiful hands,

179
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,296
mood,

180
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,832
that smile.

181
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:37,371
As Walter Payton described her,
the head upon which all the ends

182
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,540
of the world
are common.

183
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,842
The eyelids
are a little weary.

184
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,179
No one else has ever had
the genius to paint this masterpiece

185
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,980
except De Vinci.

186
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,950
But if you look at
the paint work sir.

187
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,288
Leonard's signature at large,
the brush work,

188
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:59,293
the bloom,
the technique.

189
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,361
Will you
excuse me?

190
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,470
I would say without hesitation
that the general opinion

191
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,273
of the art world
is that this

192
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,243
is the greatest portrait
ever painted.

193
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,603
I very much regret
to have to tell you sir

194
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:46,773
that this painting
is no longer for sale.

195
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,076
I don't understand
Professor.

196
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,545
I mean,
the price maybe?

197
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,014
Well now look,
I'll reconsider.

198
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,851
I'll give you a cool
four million and how's that?

199
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm sorry
Mr. Walker,

200
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:04,658
the painting is no
longer for sale.

201
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,896
Hey,
what you guys up to?

202
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,031
Take your hands off me
you nick!

203
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,133
Thanks for nothing.

204
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:22,442
That wretched Holmes
has recovered the original.

205
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,045
These are worthless.

206
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,080
Destroy them,

207
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,649
burn them.

208
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,987
Do it
yourself,

209
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,023
and let no one else
see you.

210
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,058
Yes,
Professor Moriarity.

211
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,530
I must
congratulate you, Holmes.

212
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,832
Such an honor
and so well deserved.

213
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,334
There was no
great problem.

214
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,503
The case practically
solved itself.

215
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:26,440
I hear you had a visitor
this morning.

216
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,774
Ow!!!

217
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,346
I had not been back
in Baker Street

218
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,814
more than
half an hour when...

219
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,350
But you cannot
go up there sir!

220
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:01,942
You have less
frontal development

221
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,111
than I should have
expected.

222
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,648
It's a dangerous habit,
a finger loaded firearms

223
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,283
in the pocket of one's
dressing gown.

224
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,243
You evidentially
don't know me.

225
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,313
On the contrary I think it's
fairly evident that I do.

226
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:44,885
I can spare you five minutes
if you have anything to say.

227
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:50,390
All that I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

228
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:54,795
And possibly my answer
has already crossed yours.

229
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,396
You stand fast?

230
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,232
Absolutely.

231
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,913
You frustrated me
in the affair

232
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,882
of the French gold.

233
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:18,986
So it was you behind
the Red Headed League.

234
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,457
A very ingenious
and welcome tried idea.

235
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,927
High praise
from you.

236
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:32,499
You crossed my path
first on the 4th of January.

237
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:35,502
By the middle of February
I was seriously inconvenienced

238
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,471
by you and at
the end of March

239
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,107
I was absolutely
hampered in my plans.

240
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,343
And now with this last business
in France you have placed me

241
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:46,213
in such a position
by your continual persecution

242
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,683
that I am in positive danger
of losing my liberty.

243
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:58,525
The situation is becoming
an impossible one.

244
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,162
Have you any suggestion
to make?

245
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,733
You must drop it
Mr. Holmes.

246
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,703
You really must
you know.

247
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,139
And what if
I refuse?

248
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,209
I'm quite sure that a man
of your intelligence

249
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,179
will see that there can be
but one outcome to this affair.

250
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,915
It is necessary
that you should withdraw.

251
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,318
You have worked things
in such a fashion

252
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:27,421
that we have only
one resource left.

253
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,524
It has been an intellectual
treat to me to see

254
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,627
the way in which
you grappled with this matter.

255
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,698
But I say unaffectedly
that it would be a grief to me

256
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:41,368
to be forced to take
an extreme measure.

257
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:47,174
Oh, you smile sir

258
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:50,010
but it really would
I do assure you.

259
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,279
Danger is part of
my trade.

260
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,782
This is not danger.

261
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:58,152
It is inevitable
destruction.

262
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:00,554
You stand in the way
not merely of an individual

263
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,524
but of a mighty organization,
the full extent of which

264
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,426
even you with all your
cleverness have been

265
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,695
unable to realize.

266
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:13,300
You must stand clear Mr. Holmes
or be trouble under foot.

267
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:17,204
You know I'm afraid
that in the pleasure

268
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:20,107
of this conversation
I am neglecting business

269
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:23,911
of importance
which awaits me elsewhere.

270
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:31,785
Well, well,
it seems a pity

271
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:36,690
but I've
done what I could.

272
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:53,607
This is a duel
between you and me Mr. Holmes.

273
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,845
You hope to place
me in the dark.

274
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,047
You hope
to beat me.

275
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,618
If you are clever enough
to bring destruction on me,

276
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:11,325
rest assured
I shall do as much for you.

277
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:22,202
You have paid me
several compliments,

278
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,338
Mr. Moriarity.

279
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,875
Let me pay you one
in return when I say that if

280
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,811
I were assured of
the former eventuality

281
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,348
I would, in the interests
of the public,

282
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,185
cheerfully accept
the later.

283
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:44,825
I can promise you the one
but not the other.

284
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:25,232
He is the Napoleon
of crime Watson.

285
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,301
For years
I have endeavored

286
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,304
to break through
the veil which shrouded him

287
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:35,242
and at last
I have seized a thread

288
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:40,514
and followed it
to Moriarity himself.

289
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:45,085
And now I'm ready
to close on him.

290
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:47,721
If he doesn't
close upon you first.

291
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:59,299
On Monday next,
matters will be right

292
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,270
but the Professor
and all the principal members

293
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,773
of his gang will be
in the hands of the police.

294
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:12,880
Then will come the greatest
criminal trial of the century,

295
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,982
the clearing up of
over 40 mysteries

296
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,551
and the room
full of them.

297
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:22,523
I cannot do better
than to get away

298
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,825
for the few
remaining days.

299
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,628
It would give me great pleasure
Watson if you would come

300
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,329
onto the continent
with me.

301
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:30,931
The continent?

302
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,333
I'd be delighted Holmes,
but where?

303
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:34,368
Anywhere.

304
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,003
It's all
the same to me.

305
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,238
Yes, but won't
we have to dispose of

306
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:40,207
Professor Moriarity
first?

307
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:44,278
It seems to me that we're
under siege in this very room.

308
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:48,849
And that reminds me
I must be on my way.

309
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,984
Won't you
stay the night?

310
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:53,921
No, it's too dangerous for you
if I stay here.

311
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,398
I will leave the way I came
and find lodgings

312
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,066
with my brother
Mycroft.

313
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,768
We start
tomorrow morning.

314
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,236
Tomorrow morning?

315
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,538
Oh, yes,
it is most necessary.

316
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,374
Now here are your instructions
and I beg of you

317
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,376
to follow them
to the letter.

318
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:19,413
We are now playing
a double-handed game with me,

319
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,715
Watson against
the most powerful syndicate

320
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,484
of criminals
in Europe.

321
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,152
You will dispatch
whatever luggage

322
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,654
you intend to take by
a trusted messenger unaddressed

323
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,623
at the Victoria Station
tonight.

324
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:32,726
In the morning you will send
Mrs. Hudson for a handsome cab,

325
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,496
desiring her
not to take the first

326
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,799
or second which may
present itself.

327
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:44,138
You will drive to the Strand end of La Famules,

328
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,440
handing the address
to the cabman

329
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,643
but with a request
that he will not throw it away.

330
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:12,199
Have your fare ready
and the instant that your cab

331
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,236
stops move speedily through
the muse and time yourself

332
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,674
to reach the other end at
exactly a quarter past 9:00

333
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:24,211
where you will find a small
broom waiting close to the curb

334
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:27,281
driven by a fellow
with a heavy black coat,

335
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,683
tipped at the collar
with red.

336
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:33,020
Into this you will stay
and you will reach Victoria

337
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,689
in time for
the continental express.

338
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,572
Excuse me sir, I
wonder if you speak Italian.

339
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,006
No,
I'm afraid not.

340
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,943
I'm looking for the gentleman
who reserved this compartment.

341
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,110
Not a sign of him
sir.

342
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:59,313
If you're traveling
you better get aboard.

343
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,623
My dear Watson
you haven't even condescended

344
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,459
to say good morning
to me.

345
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,634
Good heavens Holmes,
how you startled me.

346
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:57,871
It is still necessary
to take every precaution.

347
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,729
I did rather fine,
Watson.

348
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,325
I see that this express runs
in connection with the boat

349
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,761
so I think we've shaken off
Moriarity very effectively.

350
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:58,365
Well what will
he do then?

351
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,367
What I
should do.

352
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,469
Engage a special
train.

353
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,571
But he'll arrive
too late.

354
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,641
You'll observe from your
Bradshaw that this train

355
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:10,477
stops at Canterbury
and again at the boat.

356
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:12,613
Moriarity will
catch us there.

357
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:16,617
Good heavens anybody would think
that we were the criminals.

358
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:19,419
Let's arrest him
as soon as he arrives.

359
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,456
No, that would ruin
everything.

360
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,759
If we should catch the big fish
then the smaller

361
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,428
would dart right and left
out of the net.

362
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:31,498
No, no,
and the rest is invisible.

363
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:34,134
Well what then?

364
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:38,272
We shall
get ours at Canterbury.

365
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:58,358
But Holmes
our luggage.

366
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:01,862
We must give Moriarity
something to follow.

367
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,864
What will
we do?

368
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:06,533
We shall go
across country.

369
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:19,279
Here we are Holmes, Bradshaw
shouldn't let you down.

370
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,317
From Ashford Junction
we can take a 1:00 slow train

371
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,420
to Hastings,
then onto the dear old

372
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,691
London Brighton
and South Coast line,

373
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:34,928
Bax Hill on to Lewis non-stop,
then onto New Haven,

374
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:37,131
evening boat
to Vienna.

375
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,800
I think we've got time
for an early lunch.

376
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:47,307
So soon.

377
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:18,272
There are limits you see
to even our friend's intelligence.

378
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:22,643
And now Watson,
we shall treat ourselves

379
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:26,747
for a couple of carpet bags,
encourage the manufacturers,

380
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,717
the countries through which
we travel and make our way

381
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,353
at leisure
into Switzerland

382
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:36,924
via Brussels,
Luxemberg...

383
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:41,261
It fell out as Sherlock Holmes
had predicted.

384
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:44,264
We stayed two nights
in Brussels,

385
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:47,734
then began to make our
leisurely way southeast.

386
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:51,171
For a charming week we
progressed towards the Alps.

387
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:19,666
What do you
think?

388
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,170
A common enough occurrence
in the mountains.

389
00:33:55,302 --> 00:34:00,240
Ah, nothing like drinking
the wine where it's grown.

390
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,147
Hmm.

391
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:15,489
All gang safely secured,
only Moriarity escaped the net,

392
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:17,357
signed Mycroft.

393
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,794
He's given them
the slip.

394
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:26,333
I think it would be better
if you were to

395
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,535
return to England
Watson.

396
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,971
Why?

397
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:35,242
You will find me
a very dangerous companion now.

398
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:40,614
Moriarity will devote
all his energies to taking his

399
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:43,884
revenge upon me
and if I have a companion...

400
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:46,220
Would you be
rid of me?

401
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,790
No, except for the reasons
I've given.

402
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:54,027
We've been in tight places
before together.

403
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:57,397
Never as tight
as this one.

404
00:34:57,498 --> 00:35:00,667
I'm not leaving you
Holmes,

405
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,770
not unless
you order me to go.

406
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,116
I've never been
to Switzerland before

407
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:19,620
but the beauty of the landscape
reminded me irresistibly

408
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,889
of the northwest frontier
provinces of India.

409
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:26,093
But in spite of the lovely
scenery all around us,

410
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:29,062
it was clear to me
that never for one instant

411
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:31,231
did Sherlock Holmes
forget the shadow

412
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:32,966
that lay
across him.

413
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:31,558
I could tell by his
sharp scrutiny of every face

414
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:35,095
that he was well convinced
that go where we would

415
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:38,132
we would not be clear
of the danger

416
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,467
that was dogging
our footsteps.

417
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,579
What was that?

418
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,703
See anything?

419
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,705
No, nothing.

420
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:54,341
It's time
we went on our way.

421
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,077
Hans,
we're on our way.

422
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:13,861
At last we reached the heart
of the burnice overland

423
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,063
and came to the village
of Mirengland

424
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,732
where we put up
at the Englisher Hall

425
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,869
then kept
by Peter Steiler the Elder.

426
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,519
Uh, Steiler?

427
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:52,226
The walk over to the hills
to Rosenlawry is very beautiful.

428
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:56,263
You can stay the night
there and come back the next day

429
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,766
but you must not on
any account miss

430
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:03,737
the falls of Reichenbach
which is only a small detour.

431
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:07,174
Uh, there it is.

432
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:40,808
It is indeed
a fearful place.

433
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:45,312
The torrent, swollen
by the melting glacier,

434
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:50,350
plunges into a tremendous abyss
in which the spray rose up

435
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:53,454
like the smoke
from a burning house.

436
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:19,213
Herr, Dr. Watson.

437
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,350
Herr, Dr. Watson.

438
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,785
Yes?

439
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,654
Herr Steiler told me
to give you this.

440
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,790
It is very urgent.

441
00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:34,027
It seems an English woman
was taken to the hotel

442
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,798
after we left on her way
to friends in Lucerne.

443
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:39,833
She's had
a great hemorrhage.

444
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,435
Tuberculoses.

445
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,270
Oh, no doubt.

446
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,506
It appears
she's dying.

447
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,775
An English doctor
would be a great consolation.

448
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,911
I'm afraid
I must go back Holmes.

449
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:52,446
Of course.

450
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:55,315
Steiler suggests
that this lad shows you the way

451
00:41:55,415 --> 00:41:58,418
to Rosenlawy
and I'll join you there later.

452
00:41:58,552 --> 00:41:59,486
A good plan.

453
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:27,648
Hey!

454
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,361
I trust
she's no worse.

455
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:26,240
You didn't
write this?

456
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:32,279
There is no sick
English woman at the hotel?

457
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:36,183
No, but it has
the hotel mark.

458
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,686
Of course, there was
a tall old Englishman

459
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:41,755
who came here after
you had gone.

460
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,157
He said...

461
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:56,363
It was the sight
of the Alpine stalk

462
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:59,967
that turned me cold
and sick.

463
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,070
He had not gone
to Rosenlawy.

464
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,241
I stood for a minute or two
to collect myself

465
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:11,845
for I was dazed
with the horror of the thing.

466
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:16,316
And then I began to think
of Holmes' own methods

467
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,886
and to try
to practice them.

468
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,392
Holmes,

469
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:30,898
Holmes,

470
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:36,770
Holmes.

471
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:11,305
My Dear Watson,
I write these few lines

472
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:14,341
through the courtesy
of Mr. Moriarity

473
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:17,177
who awaits my convenience
for the final discussion

474
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,847
of those questions
which lie between us.

475
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,916
I'm pleased to think
that I shall be able

476
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:26,220
to free society from any further
affects of his presence.

477
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,956
Though I fear
that it is at a cost

478
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,892
which will give pain
to my friends

479
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:34,461
and especially
my dear Watson,

480
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:37,464
to you.

481
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,670
As you know, my career
had in any case

482
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,939
reached a crisis.

483
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:49,476
And no possible conclusion
to it could be more congenial

484
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:51,645
to me
than this.

485
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:55,215
Indeed if I may make
a full confession to you,

486
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,751
I was convinced
that the letter...

487
00:46:57,851 --> 00:46:59,820
was a hoax.

488
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,589
I made every disposition
of my property

489
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:04,491
before leaving
England

490
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:07,027
and handed it
to my brother Mycroft.

491
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:10,030
Good bye
and good luck

492
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,267
and believe me
to be my dear fellow,

493
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,670
very sincerely yours,
Sherlock Holmes.

494
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:29,616
In this situation
I have little doubt

495
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:33,153
that a personal contest
between the two men

496
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:35,689
ended as it could hardly
fail to end.

497
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,425
Ahh!

498
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:29,336
It's with a heavy heart
that I take up my pen

499
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:35,409
to write these last words
in which I shall ever record

500
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:38,745
singular gifts
by which my friend

501
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:42,082
Mr. Sherlock Holmes
was distinguished.

502
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:46,253
I shall
ever regard him

503
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:49,756
as the best
and wisest man

504
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,892
I have
ever known.
