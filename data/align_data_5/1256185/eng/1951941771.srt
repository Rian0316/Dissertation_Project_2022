1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
kids,in the fall of 2008,i've had a little problem

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,460
All right, I got to get to Stella's. 

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,960
Tonight's the night, guys. 

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,360
I've tried it before, I've failed every time. 

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,200
This time, I am gonna do it. 

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,200
Tonight. . . 

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,660
I pick up a lesbian. 

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,600
Robin, I need your lipstick. 

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,030
Oh,man!

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,130
Take pictures, all right?

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,430
bye Ted

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>I lived in New York,</i>

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,930
<i>but Stella lived across</i>
<i>the river in New Jersey. . . </i>

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,430
Oh,man!

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,930
<i>. . . which meant I was always</i><i>taking the train. </i>

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,930
What's up, Ted?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,530
Hey, Matisse. 

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,430
Hey, T-Diddy!

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,100
-You missed it. -Robin got that national anchor job. 

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,830
And we got a free bottle of champagne. 

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,500
Ah, but it's empty now. 

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,100
Oh,man!

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>And as result, it seemed like</i>

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>I was missing out</i> <i>on everything. </i>

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
Sorry, we couldn't wait. 

26
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,230
It was getting cold. 

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,460
Oh,man!

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,260
Hey, big guy. 

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,360
What's up, G?

30
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,260
Are you okay?

31
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,600
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just. . . 

32
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,260
you know, I want to hang out with you guys. 

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,900
I want to hang out with my friends. 

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,900
I just feel like I'm spending all my time on the train. 

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,530
Okay, how about this,

36
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,060
why don't you ask your friends to come out here sometime?

37
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,560
That's a great idea. 

38
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,430
You want us to go to New Jersey?

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,600
Oh, that is rich. 

40
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,430
Why?

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, for starters,

42
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't have any of my gold medallions anymore. 

43
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,760
I sold them when they went out of style 400 years ago. 

44
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,200
Lily?

45
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,600
Oh, sorry, Ted. 

46
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,430
I'm a born and raised New Yorker. 

47
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,430
I'm programmed to despise and loathe

48
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,430
New Jersey and all that it stands for. 

49
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,830
Why am I telling you this?

50
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,760
You hate New Jersey more than anyone. 

51
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,600
What? I don't hate New Jersey. 

52
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,800
Why would you think that?

53
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,630
And then he cut in front of me. 

54
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,100
God, I hate line cutters

55
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,300
more than I hate New Jersey. 

56
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,700
Well, that's not true. 

57
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,560
There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey. 

58
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,960
Right?

59
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,130
Hey, you want us to wait for you?

60
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,660
No, I might be awhile. 

61
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,660
I got a drop a massive New Jersey. 

62
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay,

63
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,830
so New Jersey's not my favorite place. 

64
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,260
But once Stella and I get married

65
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,700
and she and Lucy move in with me,

66
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,630
I'll never set foot in New Jersey again. 

67
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,530
Unless I'm going to see a Giants game

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,130
or flying out of Newark

69
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,830
or God forbid, disposing of a body. 

70
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,960
Ted, if you murder me and bury me in New Jersey,

71
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,060
I'll haunt you forever. 

72
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,160
But if I murder you and bury you somewhere else?

73
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,830
Eh, I'll leave you alone. 

74
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,330
I'm sure you had your reasons. 

75
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,230
kids, your Aunt Robin was sick <i>of her job at Metro News One. </i>

76
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,330
<i>She was sick of the low</i> <i>production value. . . </i>

77
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm Robin Scherbatsky, and you're watching. . . 

78
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Etro News One at 11:00. 

79
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,930
And again at 1:00. 

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,960
<i>. . . sick of the stories</i> <i>she had to report. . . </i>

81
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,100
So hurry up and get your votes in

82
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
for New York's cutest doggie. 

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,130
<i>. . . and most of all,</i>

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,830
<i>she was sick of</i> <i>all the stupid puns. </i>

85
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,060
Four transit workers were electrocuTed

86
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,200
when a subway train jumped the tracks. 

87
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,630
Stay tuned for the. . . 

88
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,260
shocking derails. 

89
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,000
Joel, people died. 

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,460
<i>So when the call came in</i>

91
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,700
<i>that she got</i> <i>the big national anchor job,</i>

92
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>she finally got to say</i> <i>the words</i>

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,730
<i>she'd been dreaming of saying</i> <i>for years. . . </i>

94
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Tonight will be my last broadcast. 

95
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,300
I came to Metro News One as a little caterpillar. 

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,130
And for four years, this desk has been my cocoon. 

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,230
But tonight,

98
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,830
I emerge an ambitious butterfly. 

99
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,230
Why does she sound like an idiot?

100
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
-Did she have a stroke? -Yeah. 

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,030
A stroke of genius. 

102
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,260
This speech is really good. 

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,830
With one eye on the horizon,

104
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,160
one eye on the truth,

105
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,160
and one eye on all of you. 

106
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,060
You wrote it for her, didn't you?

107
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,460
It's a modified version of the speech I gave

108
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,760
when I had to leave the swim team

109
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,830
because of a chronic inner ear situation. 

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,030
I thought you were the towel boy. 

111
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,760
It's part of the team. 

112
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>So that Saturday</i> 

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,600
<i>as Robin went off</i> <i>for her first day</i> <i>at her new job,</i>

114
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
<i>we all headed across the river</i>

115
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,930
<i>to experience some of that</i> <i>crazy New Jersey nightlife. </i>

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,860
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,

117
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,260
so we can't go out. Instead. . . 

118
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,300
we're all gonna hang out here 

119
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,530
and it's gonna be just as awesome. 

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Right, we got board games,

121
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,130
we got movies. 

122
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
And I think there may be some beer out in the garage. 

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,330
Ted, this is pathetic. It's Saturday night. 

124
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
We should be out at a bar. drinking alcohol. 

125
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,630
Now I know that that sounds depressing,

126
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,560
也近乎于悲哀的边缘 但这就是事实
bordering on tragic, but it's just a fact. 

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah,and I want another crack at that chick, Doris. 

128
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,900
I know I can land that lesbian plane. 

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,160
No snakes on that plane. 

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,730


131
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,060
Okay, guys. 

132
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,760
Come on, you promised. 

133
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,500
Let's just hang out here, try to have fun. 

134
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,230
I mean, we're all together,

135
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,660
friends hanging out. 

136
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,930
Isn't that what really matters?

137
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,260
Okay, if we take the next train,

138
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,500
we can be at MacLaren's by 11:00. 

139
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,500
We can be there by 10:00. 

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,060
No, I have to change first. 

141
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,260
I am not walking into MacLaren's 

142
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,460
smelling like New Jersey. 

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
You guys really hate it here, huh?

144
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,760
What?! No!

145
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,730
Stela. . . 

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
I get it, I mean, you guys are all New Yorkers. 

147
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,600
You need to go hang out at a bar. 

148
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,930
Well, you could just hang out at the coolest bar in the state,

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,800
which is so close it will blow your mind. 

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,230
And boom goes the dynamite. 

151
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,960
The coolest bar in New Jersey. 

152
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,760
Yeah, it probably is. 

153
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,100
This is great!

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,960
We got darts. 

155
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,530
Half a ping-pong table. 

156
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,100
A fish bowl. 

157
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,830
Look what turned out to be an awesome night as promised. 

158
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,930
Maybe we can drop

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,960
some Bac-O's in here

160
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,960
and make them fight. 

161
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,000
No, thanks. 

162
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't mess with fish bowls

163
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,000
unless they have my two favorite fish--

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,760
the sucker fish and the blow fish. 

165
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,300
What up!

166
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,100
For "blow fish"?

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
I don't think so. 

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,400
Marshall. 

169
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,530
You're better than that. 

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Lily. 

171
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,230
Not good enough. 

172
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,360
Stella?

173
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,730
Sorry. 

174
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,500
I am not lowering this until someone gives me the respect

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,860
of another person's knuckles tapping against mine

176
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,200
in a light but decisive manner. 

177
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,360
Pretty, pretty. . . 

178
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,960
Pretty, pretty. . . 

179
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,560
Pretty. . . Who's a pretty baby?

180
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:41,700
Then know this. . . 

181
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,900
until it gets what it wants,

182
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,030
nay, deserves,

183
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,660
this fist will not yield. 

184
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,430
It. 

185
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,100
Will. Not. Yield. 

186
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,400
So who wants to play Scrabble?

187
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,930
Sure, whatever. 

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Oh, heads up,

189
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,730
the "X" tile is little hard to read

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,900
because a couple years ago,

191
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,760
it went all the way through my dog. 

192
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,330
You know, maybe we should get a dog again when you move in. 

193
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,700
When I what? 

194
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,030
Oh, great. There's Robin. 

195
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,030
I thought they were moving in with you. 

196
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,760
So did I. 

197
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh, God, am I moving to New Jersey?

198
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,860
Hey, guys,

199
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,830
I bet that dog was really flying high

200
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,860
after it swallowed a little "X. "

201
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,230
Nailed it!

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,830
Come on!

203
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,460
I can't live here. 

204
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,400
It wouldn't be that bad. 

205
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,330
You could put a mini- fridge over there

206
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
and maybe some knock hockey. 

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,860
Knock hockey. Nice one, Big Mon. 

208
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,360
I meant New Jersey in general,

209
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,430
not this basement. 

210
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,430
She wants me to move here?

211
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,730
I don't get it. We discussed this months ago. 

212
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,400
So I was thinking after the wedding,

213
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,600
you and Lucy could move in here. 

214
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,860
Yeah, she could play out on the fire escape,

215
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,360
maybe make friends with that guy

216
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,760
who sleeps on that couch in the alley,

217
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,730
ride her bike up and down Broadway. 

218
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
It's a great idea, Ted. 

219
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,430
I don't understand why you'd want to live in New Jersey

220
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,830
when you have a chance to live in Manhattan?

221
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,830
I thought having a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side

222
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,030
was half the reason she agreed to marry me. 

223
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,460
Really, I thought it was the whole reason. 

224
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,700
What is up?!

225
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,660
Robin, hey!

226
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,060
Looking good. 

227
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,330
Bump the Barnacle. 

228
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,300
Stella already told me not to. 

229
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,430
How was your first day?

230
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,160
-It wasn't. -What?

231
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,530
It wasn't my first day. 

232
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,560
I showed up and there were 20 other people. 

233
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,530
It turns out, I didn't actually get the job. 

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,060
I only got an audition. 

235
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,160
What, how did that happen?

236
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,330
I don't know. 

237
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,560
Because he told me that I got it. 

238
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,730
I got it?!

239
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,560
I got it!

240
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,660
And just to be clear, when I say "you got it,"

241
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,430
I mean an audition. 

242
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,760
You got an audition. 

243
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,830
I don't want there to be any confusion. 

244
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,630
You have an audition only. 

245
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
Not the job. 

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,860
Thank you! Thank you!

247
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,600
Okay, I'm going to call

248
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,800
-and beg Joel to give me my job back. 
 -No!

249
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,200
You haTed that job. 

250
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,460
I don't know, it wasn't so bad. 

251
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,360
Robin, what did they make you call Tropical Storm Hector

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
when it was raining cats and dogs?

253
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,060
A furricane. 

254
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,760
Hey, Ted. 

255
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,260
Rock me like a furricane. 

256
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,730
Thanks. 

257
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,930
Mean. 

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Okay, yeah, it sucks, but what can I do?

259
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,730
I mean, I'm not going to get that other job. 

260
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,830
You guys should have seen the other women at this audition. 

261
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,930
They all had more experience than me,

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,460
were more ethnic than me. 

263
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,060
There was an African-American chick with blue eyes,

264
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,360
how can I compete with that?

265
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,000
Mm, you can't. 

266
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,200
No, you can compete with anyone. 

267
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,930
You're Robin Scherbatsky. 

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Confident. Strong. Tall. 

269
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,860
With crazy long legs that look great in shorts. 

270
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm calling Joel. 

271
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,130
No, Robin, if you call him right now,

272
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,260
you will hate yourself. 

273
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,660
Look, I have slept with lots of women

274
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,500
who afterwards told me off and stormed out. 

275
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,660
And sometimes

276
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,960
they'd pick up the phone

277
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,160
and they'd call me

278
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,600
and then we'd hook up again. 

279
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,800
And when we were finished,

280
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,830
I could see that look on their faces,

281
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,360
that look that says they hate themselves

282
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,030
and they wish they'd never called. 

283
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,130
But if you could see that look. . . 

284
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,930
Actually, you can see that look, there's a video. 

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
www-dot. . . 

286
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
No! Stop, okay? I won't call. 

287
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,660
Don't drink the beer!

288
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,800
I just remembered when I bought it. 

289
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,960
It was right before I got pregnant with Lucy. 

290
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,160
Ted, would you mind running to PriceCo and picking some up?

291
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,460
Oh, and while you're there,

292
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,500
maybe you could sign up for a card. 

293
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,330
I mean, you'll probably end up going there all the time. 

294
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,030
That's the look. 

295
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
<i>I can't move here. </i>

296
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,260
I hate it here. 

297
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,400
I would kill myself. 

298
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,400
Maybe New Jersey's not that bad. 

299
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,860
Stella has a lawn. 

300
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,560
You could get a riding lawn mower. 

301
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,900
They sell them over there. 

302
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
I saw one with a cup holder. 

303
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,800
I saw a recliner with a built-in cup holder. 

304
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,430
I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. 

305
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
You live in New Jersey,

306
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,060
you never have to hold a cup again. 

307
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,130
I don't think I have as big a problem

308
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
holding cups as you do. 

309
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,930
I will give you $100 to fist pump me. 

310
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
$200. 

311
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,260
Just put it down, Barney. 

312
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,230
Your arm must be killing you by now. 

313
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,900
$10,000. 

314
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,560
Look, you'll be right across the river. 

315
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,860
You'll be in New York all the time. 

316
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,030
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah. 

317
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,800
Um, excuse me. 

318
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,130
You guys are from New York, right?

319
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,530
Yeah, we moved here from Manhattan. 

320
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,100
Do you ever get into the city?

321
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,130
All the time. 

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
See? All the time. 

323
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,760
When was the last time you were there?

324
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,030
We just had dinner at O'Rourke's. 

325
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,930
That's been closed for six years. 

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,530
It has been awhile. 

327
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,160
Funny, we don't miss it. 

328
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,230
Well, I guess we're New Jersey-ians now. 

329
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,260
Honey, look,

330
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,330
dog shirts. 

331
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
I can't do it. 

332
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,930
I'm just going to tell Stella

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,730
she and Lucy have to move into the city and that's that. 

334
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,260
Okay, what do you guys think?

335
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,960
Beagle or Boston terrier?

336
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,400
Are those tears?

337
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,360
They're awesome. . . 

338
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,900
manly pain tears. They're not emotional. 

339
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Okay, they're a little bit emotional. 

340
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,700
Where's Robin?

341
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,900
Oh, no. 

342
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,100
Hey, Shirley,

343
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,430
it's Robin calling for Joel. 

344
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,600
Robin, hang up the phone. Don't do this. 

345
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,200
Sorry, I know, okay?

346
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,760
Hey, Joel, it's Robin. 

347
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,700
So Madam Butterfly wants to come back to the cocoon. 

348
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,860
Yeah, look, I'm sorry I said all that stuff. 

349
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,100
Well, you can stick your sorries in your sock drawer,

350
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,800
'cause you've already been replaced. 

351
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,930
I've got Brian in makeup and he couldn't be more exciTed. 

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,300
I can't do this. I can't do this. 

353
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,030
Uh, okay, look, as much as I want to see college boy

354
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,360
here wet himself on camera,

355
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,330
if you can get here in time to read the 11:00 news,

356
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,860
you can have your old job back. 

357
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,060
Okay, I have a half hour to make it to the studio. 

358
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,460
There's no way you can make it

359
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,730
to the city in a half hour. 

360
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,930
Robin, don't do this. 

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,430
I know it's scary to bet on yourself,

362
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,360
but if you don't, nobody else will. 

363
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,860
And I'm not just saying that to get a fist bump. 

364
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,600
Although, come on, a fist bump would be great. 

365
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,630
But I really mean it. 

366
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
I am betting on myself. 

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,900
I am betting that i can make it there by 11 o'clock

368
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,430
-Hey, did you get the beer? 
-Yeah, I got 144-pack. 

369
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,400
The rest is in the trunk. 

370
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,030
And did you sign up for the membership?

371
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,260
No. 

372
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,430
Why not?

373
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,200
There was a line for the photos. . . 

374
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,460
my hair's a mess. . . 

375
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,900
I don't want to move to New Jersey. 

376
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,560
What?

377
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,700
I can't do it. 

378
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,130
And I can't see any reason

379
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,900
why you and Lucy shouldn't move to New York. 

380
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,600
Well, my daughter goes to school here. 

381
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,100
All of her friends are here. 

382
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,330
I've lived here my whole life. 

383
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,930
My whole family is here. 

384
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is my house. 

385
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm on the PTA. 

386
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,000
And as of June 1, I'm the deputy mayor. 

387
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,500
Yes, but my apartment is really close to the subway. 

388
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,760
Ted, we're not moving, end of discussion. 

389
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,330
How can it be end of discussion

390
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,830
if there's never been a discussion?

391
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,700
This is part of being a parent. 

392
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,830
I can't just uproot Lucy. 

393
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,530
People with kids move all the time. 

394
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,500
I think it would be really great for Lucy

395
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
to grow up in the greatest city in the world. 

396
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,630
Oh, here we go-- 

397
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,500
New York's the greatest city in the whole wide world. 

398
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,660
It's where dreams come true

399
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,000
and pigeon poop tastes like tapioca. 

400
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,660
Want to know a little secret, Ted?

401
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,300
New Jersey is better than New York. 

402
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,760
Better than. . . ?

403
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,400
You think. . . ? I. . . 

404
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,960
The Empire State Buil. . . 

405
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,860
H and H Bage. . . 

406
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,300
Lincoln Ce. . . 

407
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,830
Zabar's. . . 

408
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,860
Papaya King. 

409
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,160
纽约是
New York is

410
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,630
the intellectual and cultural hub of the planet. 

411
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,600
New York is full of weirdoes, and snobs and mean people. 

412
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,130
Ted, do you know that once, an old lady

413
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,230
actually called me a bitch and threw a cat in my face?

414
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,700
And you want to know if that happened in New Jersey?

415
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,160
Uh-uh, 86th and Lex,

416
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,930
right in front of your beloved little Papaya King. 

417
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,930
Ted, people are nice in New Jersey. 

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,460
I mean it's the kind of place where you know your neighbors. 

419
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,460
Hey, I know my neighbors. 

420
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,730
Oh, yeah? Like who?

421
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,960
Right across the hall, I got. . . 

422
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,900
Clax. . . pa. . . mon. . . 

423
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,830
Claxpamon? His name is Paxton. 

424
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,530
Love that dude. 

425
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,930
Sorry,in a hurry. Got to get to the front. 

426
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,900
Got to get off first. 

427
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,030
Whoa, don't run over Matisse. 

428
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,960
Okay, so this is crazy. 

429
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,330
You can't actually think that New Jersey is better than New York. 

430
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,530
New York has Broadway. We win right there. 

431
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,700
Oh, no, she did not. 

432
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,160
Knuckle up for safety. 

433
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
We have Atlantic City. 

434
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,560
Can't beat the A. C. 

435
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,330
Pretty please? No one has to know. 

436
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,500
New York has Greenwich Village. 

437
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,830
New Jersey has The Shore. 

438
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
Woody Allen. 

439
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,900
Oscar-winning chronicler of urban neuroses. 

440
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
Bump it!

441
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,100
-Bruce Springsteen. 
 -Sinatra. 

442
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,530
He's from Hoboken. . . New Jersey. 

443
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Yeah, but what city is he singing about?

444
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,730
It's not "Secaucus, Secaucus. "

445
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,330
Come on. . . 

446
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,660
<i>Now you kids can either</i> 
<i>believe this or not,</i>

447
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,230
<i>but this is how your Aunt Robin</i> 
 <i>swears it happened. </i>

448
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,960
Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey

449
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,400
you don't picture yourself loving New York,

450
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,000
but trust me, Marshall didn't expect to,

451
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,830
and now he wouldn't think of living anywhere else. 

452
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,060
I hate New York!

453
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,330
I'm sorry, but it's true. 

454
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,300
Okay, today I was walking around PriceCo. 

455
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,260
Have you ever been there? It's huge. 

456
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,160
All the stores in New York are so cramped. 

457
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,830
Every time I turn, I knock something over. 

458
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,030
I'm like some huge monster that came out of the ocean

459
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,130
to destroy bodegas. 

460
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,730
But, Marshall, you love New York. 

461
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,930
Yeah, I do, except that I hate it. 

462
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,230
I'm too big for New York, okay?

463
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,100
I'm always trying to fit into cramped little subway seats

464
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,360
or duck under doorways that were built 150 years ago. 

465
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,930
Hey, guess what? People are bigger now. 

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,300
Build bigger doorways. What the hell is the matter with you?

467
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,500
Small city, big man-- give it up. 

468
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,960
And it's so loud, all the time. 

469
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,460
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps. 

470
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,460
Well, guess what, I like to sleep. 

471
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,700
I've been tired for eight years. 

472
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,700
Tired and scared with black and blue marks on my elbows

473
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,300
from trying to fit through all these tiny elf doorways. 

474
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,630
New Jersey's great. 

475
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,330
It's got huge stores,

476
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,430
and lawns and you never have to carry a cup again. 

477
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,030
Not for the rest of your life. 

478
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm not afraid to say it--

479
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,660
I love New Jersey. 

480
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,330
I'm just kidding. 

481
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,460
Look, Stella. . . 

482
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,360
I get it, okay?

483
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,360
I see what you're saying. 

484
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,530
I guess. . . 

485
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,830
we could live in Brooklyn. 

486
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,230
You know what, Ted. . . 

487
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
live wherever you want. 

488
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,930
I don't care. 

489
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,230
Awkward silence. Tap it. 

490
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,400
Oh, hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?

491
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,000
There was some loud noises in the basement. 

492
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,500
Sorry about that. Why don't you got back to bed, sweetie. 

493
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
I can't go to sleep without a story. 

494
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay, I'll just get your mom. . . 

495
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,730
Why don't you read it to me?

496
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,130
Okay, come on. 

497
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,000
* You know she thrills me with all her charms *

498
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,760
* When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms *

499
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:47,360
* My little girl gives me everything *

500
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,730
* When I'm walking down the street with you *

501
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,230
I'm moving here. 

502
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,830
Really?

503
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Really. 

504
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,460
New Jersey wins. 

505
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh! Oh, thank you!

506
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,100
Wait. . . 

507
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,160
Good evening, New York. 

508
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,630
Hey, look, she made it. 

509
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,260
Our top story tonight--

510
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,160
the newborn panda at the Central Park Zoo

511
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,000
got its first tooth today. 

512
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
I guess that makes her a. . . 

513
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,900
molar bear. 

514
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Molar bear. 

515
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,030
Molar bear. 

516
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,160
You know what? I really am done. 

517
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,360
Good night, New York. 

518
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,660
Wow, she really quit. 

519
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,130
You think we had anything to do with that?

520
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,100
Yeah, I think we did. 

521
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,830
Nice job, Barney. 

522
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, my God!

523
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,600
Thank you!

524
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,900
Oh, that was killing my arm. 

525
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,730
My arm hasn't been this sore since I was 13 years old

526
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,560
and figured out how to lock a bathroom. 

527
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,360
Up top. 

528
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, no. 

529
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,200
What's wrong?

530
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, I officially didn't get that job. 

531
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,700
I'm so sorry. 

532
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,860
That's okay. 

533
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,560
