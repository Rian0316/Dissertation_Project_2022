是 一种药效温和的镇定剂
Yes, a mild sedative.

41
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,280
会不会是量太多了?
Did you give her too much?

00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:26,276
克莱索恩小姐 我告诉过你不要这么歇斯底里的

一个在睡梦中死去 还剩下八个!
one overslept himself and then there were eight!

47

There were ten of these and ten of us and now there's eight.

51
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,284

52
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,324
是你发现的

53
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,312
当然不是我了 我为什么要这么做?
Course it wasn't me. Why would I do that?

54
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,316
为了博得大家的注意? 你是不是很渴望被人关注呢 克莱索恩小姐?
To be the centre of attention? Do you crave attention, Miss Claythorne?

55
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,344
- 无论是那种关注都行吗?  - 你胡说什么?

00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,268
她是个优秀的厨娘
She was a wonderful cook.

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,294
真可惜
Such a shame.

60

是的 夫人

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,292
罗杰斯 你有没有拿走两个瓷像?
Rogers, did you take away two of these figures?

63
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,340
没有 小姐
No, miss.

64
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:29,328
罗杰斯先生 请节哀 纳拉科特大概什么时候能来?
Condolences, Mr Rogers. When are you expecting Narracott?

65
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,286
上午或中午 先生 他过来的时间不太确定
Mid to late morning, sir. His timekeeping is somewhat erratic.

66
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,280
还有什么需要我的吗?
Will that be all?

67
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,322
没事了 谢谢你 罗杰斯 非常感谢

68
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:43,280
东尼·马斯顿年轻健康
Tony Marston was young and strong.

69
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:46,288
他不会是因为服用兴奋剂而死的
He didn't die from some stimulant.

70
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,312
可能是被人下毒了
Perhaps he was poisoned.

71
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:51,260
而罗杰斯太太可能是死于服药过量
And Mrs Rogers, perhaps she was given too much.

72
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,268
医生 你的药箱里都有什么药?
What drugs do you have in your medical bag, Doctor?

73
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,308
你为什么会带药箱来?
Why did you even bring it?

74
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,260
你是来做客的 又不是来工作的
You are a guest, it's not work.

75
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,282
说实话 我就是来工作的
Actually, it is work.

76
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,256
但出于医患保密协议 我本不应该说出来
I was trying to maintain some sort of professional discretion.

77
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,324
不过
However,

78
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,332
欧文太太患有女性精神类疾病
Mrs Owen suffers from female neuroses.

79
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,294
我的专长就是治疗女性疾病

80
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,252
欧文先生是请我来作为医生
Mr Owen engaged me in a professional capacity

81
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,328
- 照顾他妻子的  - 那你不再当外科医生了 是吗 医生?
- to tend to his wife.  - Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor?

82
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,316
人不会无缘无故死去!
People do not just die out of nowhere for no reason!

83
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:25,296
他们会死 是因为有人对他们做了什么事!
They die because something was done to them by someone!

84
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,272
- 我要去查查你的包  - 你敢碰一下我的东西试试!
- I'm going to check your bag. - Don't you dare touch my possessions!

85
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,304
- 你有什么见不得人的东西吗?  - 我来检查怎么样?
- What have you got to hide?  - How about I do it?

86
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,328
我才不会像肮脏的罪犯一样任人搜查呢!
I'm not being searched like some grubby criminal!

87
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,320
那不如让将军和他一起去?
Then what if the General goes with him?

88
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,292
将军可是个体面的人!
He's an honourable man!

89
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,328
好吧! 不过这样的话 你们也得去搜查
Fine! But while you're at it, you might want to search

90
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,860
沃格雷夫法官的箱子
Judge Wargrave's case as well.

91
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,310
我知道我在哪里见过你了
I know where I've seen you before.

92
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:49,268
在我哈利街诊所楼下的那个小伙子

93
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,296
他是个治疗癌症的专家
he's a cancer specialist.

94
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:51,340
我就是在那里见到你的
That's where I saw you.

95
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:54,344
如果说谁的箱子里会有强效止痛药和镇定剂的话
If anyone has strong painkillers and sedatives in his case,

96
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,274
那就是沃格雷夫法官了
it's Judge Wargrave.

97
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,326
是这样吗 法官先生?
Is that true, Judge?

98
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,258
没错 我身体确实不好 
I have had health problems, yes.

99
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:07,316
- 医生 你这样太过分了  - 不怪我 是你逼的
- Then that's very cruel, Doctor.  - Don't blame me. You pushed it.

100
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,290
将军 我们走吧?
General, shall we?

101
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:20,318
只有温和的镇定剂
Just mild sedatives.

102
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,288
我就是这么说的
As I said.

103
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,336
非常普通 没什么特别之处
Bog-standard. Nothing special.

104
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,302
我的手术很成功
My surgery was a success.

105
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:33,252
这里... 这所房子 这个小岛...
This... the house, the island...

106
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,304
本该是我修养的地方
is meant to be my recuperation.

107
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,280
吹吹海风
Sea air,

108
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,296
安安静静地
peace,

109
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,320
好好休息
and rest.

110
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,262
对不起 我真的很抱歉
Very sorry. I'm very sorry.

111
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:49,308
- 就到此为止吧  - 这事还没完呢
- Well, there's an end to it.  - Like hell it is.

112
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,290
为什么没人搜查她的东西?
Why shouldn't she be searched?

113
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,252
不是说男女平等吗
Equal rights for women.

114
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,344
我们看看你都有些什么东西
Let's see what you've got.

115
00:05:57,346 --> 00:06:00,346
阿姆斯特朗医生 请冷静一点
Doctor Armstrong, control yourself, please.

116
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,332
你以为你自己是谁?
Who the hell do you think you are?

117
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,342
我是医生 你就是个秘书
I'm a doctor. You're a secretary.

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,274
有人动过它们
Somebody moved them.

119
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,312
肯定是这样
They did.

120
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:24,346
绝对有人动过那些瓷像
Someone did that.

121
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,314
你真的杀了那些人吗?
Did you really kill all those men?

122
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:59,262
是的 克莱索恩小姐 我确实杀了他们
Yes, Miss Claythorne. I did kill all those men.

123
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,316
还杀了别的人
And more.

124
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,296
为什么?
Why?

125
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,338
在当时 这样做才是聪明的选择
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

126
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:12,274
他们手里有我想要的东西 那一次是钻石
They had something I wanted. In this case, it was diamonds.

127
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,256
那可比几条人命更值钱
Worth more than a few lives.

128
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:17,298
你呢?
What about you?

129
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:23,310
你想要的是什么?
What did you want?

130
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,278
我差点淹死了
I nearly drowned.

131
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,340
我没能救下一个本应由我照看的小男孩
I failed to save a little boy in my care.

132
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:34,346
而我无时无刻不在为此感到愧疚
And there isn't one minute of every day that I'm not sorry for that.

133
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,320
你怎么就不内疚呢?
Why aren't you?

134
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:39,642
我知道我是什么样的人
I know what I am.

135
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,618
我也知道迟早有一天我要付出代价
I always knew it would catch up with me.

136
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,494
这一天到了
And here it is.

137
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,324
"我爱你 我爱你 我爱你
"I love you, I love you, I love you.

138
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:55,252
我思念你 你的吻 还有你的手爱抚我的感觉
I think about you and you kissing me, and your hands on me and in me,

139
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,272
你吻遍我每一寸肌肤 我无法忍受
and your mouth on my body and I cannot bear

140
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,332
你不在我身边的日子
that you are not with me now.

141
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:04,276
我希望 我盼望 我渴望你能陪伴我 亲爱的
I wish, I long, I crave for you, my darling,

142
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,260
我也觉得这样对亲爱的约翰太残忍了
and I feel so cruel to poor, dear John.

143
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,332
可是 亨利 太阳在你眼中升起又落下
The sun rises and sets in your eyes, Henry.

144
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,262
我爱你 我爱你

145
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,318
我永远属于你"
I am yours."

146
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,276
大家都整装待发了 长官
The men are all ready for the whistle, sir.

147
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,710
士气也很高涨
Morale, fairly good.

148
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,318
来吧 让我帮您
Here. Er, let me.

149
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:41,294
亨利
Henry.

150
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:48,332
你一直都是我
You've been a great friend

151
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,262
和我妻子的好朋友
to my wife and I.

152
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,294
以后你就叫我约翰怎么样?
Perhaps you could call me John?

153
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,634
谢谢 约翰
Thank you, John.

154
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,330
先生 我和罗杰斯太太已经来这里一周了
Myself and Mrs Rogers were here for a week

155
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,830
除了来送货的纳拉克特之外
without seeing another soul

156
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,960
从来没有见过别人
apart from Narracott with the delivery, sir.

157
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,276
隆巴德
Lombard.

158
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:38,256
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

159
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,304
我们在这里干等尤利克·诺尔曼·欧文
We're sat around waiting for Ulick Norman Owen.

160
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,322
如果他一直都在这里呢?
What if he's been here all along?

161
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:47,306
这里有很多地方可供他藏身
Plenty of places he could be hiding.

162
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,326
等等我
Wait for me.

163
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:27,248
拜托了 拜托了 拜托了 别抖了
Please, please, please, just fucking stop. Stop.

164
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,276
停下 停下
Stop, stop,

165
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,278
停下吧 停下...
stop, stop...

166
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,342
这太吓人了!
This is barmy!

167
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,298
不可能有人藏在那下面
No-one could hide down there.

168
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,320
嘿 胖子 你有过被人追捕的感觉吗?
Ever get the feeling you're being hunted, Tubs?

169
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:07,300
别那么叫我 我才不胖
Stop calling me that. I ain't even fat.

170
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,300
而且我也没有过那种感觉
And, no, I don't.

171
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,254
是吗?
Really?

172
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:16,272
因为不论欧文先生是谁
Cos Mr Owen, whoever he may be,

173
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,336
他对我们都非常了解
knows a lot about us.

174
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,292
他可不了解我
Well, not about me.

175
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:22,336
爱德华·塞顿是个无赖 还是个同性恋
Edward Landor was a degenerate. He was a pansy.

176
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:25,262
他回牢房的时候自己从台阶上摔了下去
He fell down the steps into his cell.

177
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,278
你从没碰过他?
You never touched him?

178
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,290
那种肮脏下流的人 我都不愿意靠近他们
I wouldn't want to be near one of them dirty bastards.

179
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,298
来吧 胖子 跟上
Come on, Tubs, keep up.

180
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,304
将军?
General?

181
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:02,282
你收拾好行李了吗?
Is your suitcase ready?

182
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,318
她还是死了
She died.

183
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,324
在战后 死于西班牙流感
Of Spanish influenza, after the war.

184
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,300
谁?
Who?

185
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:17,264
我夫人 莱斯利
My wife Lesley.

186
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,332
一切都过去之后
After all that,

187
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,294
她竟然死于了西班牙流感
she died of the Spanish flu.

188
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,260
那时死了很多人
So many did.

189
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:33,272
我本应该像绅士一样退出...
I should've just stepped aside like a gentleman and...

190
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:35,258
让他们幸福地生活在一起的
just let them be happy.

191
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:41,276
回房子里来吧 将军
Do come back to the house, General.

192
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,332
你还没有把箱子拿下来
You haven't brought your case down yet

193
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,266
我们希望纳拉科特一来就马上离开
and we want to get away as soon as Mr Narracott arrives.

194
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:52,268
你得明白 纳拉科特不会回来了
He's not coming, Narracott, you know.

195
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,300
不会有人来找我们的
No-one's coming for us.

196
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:57,270
我们没法离开这个小岛了 这就是我们的结局
We won't be leaving the island. This is the end.

197
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,340
在知道一切都快要结束的时候 反而会有种解脱的感觉
It's a relief to come to the end, to know that it's over.

198
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:07,316
你现在可能还理解不了 但是总有一天...
You won't understand that yet but you will...

199
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,266
你会明白的
in time.

200
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,292
我想是您弄错了
I think you're quite mistaken.

201
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:17,302
会有船来接我们的 到时候我们大家都要等你了
The boat will come and we'll all be waiting for you.

202
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,256
克莱索恩小姐
Ah, Miss Claythorne.

203
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,276
真好
Good.

204
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:18,286
搬两把椅子过来 好吗?
Bring a couple of chairs, would you?

205
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,284
出什么事了?
What's going on?

206
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:32,268
怎么上午就喝这么多酒
It's a bit early to be on the sauce.

207
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,300
这一上午可够难熬的
It's been something of a morning.

208
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,298
嘿 嘿 嘘!
Hey. Hey, sh!

209
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:43,248
那个混蛋就在楼下 我听到了
Bastard's down there. I heard him.

210
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,252
哪个混蛋?
What bastard?

211
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,304
欧文
Owen.

212
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:49,280
我听见他的动静了
I can hear him moving about.

213
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,274
在马斯顿的房间里
Marston's room.

214
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,262
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

215
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,272
行军床
Camp bed.

216
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:28,256
我们得找个地方存放行军床...
We had to find somewhere to store it and...

217
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,316
- 而年轻人一般不会注意床下有什么  - 你...
- young men don't look under beds.  - But what... 

218
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,280
还要行军床做什么? 你想干什么?
do you need a camp bed for? What were you planning?

219
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,460
我没法在自己房里睡觉了 不是吗?
Well, I can't sleep in my room, can I?

220
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,250
我妻子的缘故
Me wife.

221
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,140
是啊 当然了
Yeah, obviously. Of course.

222
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,090
我得找个别的地方收起来
I've got to find somewhere else to set up.

223
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,680
为什么? 我们都要走了
What for? We're all leaving.

224
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,470
你们也许要走了 可这是我的工作
Well, you might be. This is my job.

225
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,370
除非雇主解雇我 否则我哪也不能去
I can't go anywhere until my employer dismisses me.

226
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,840
你的雇主? 你的雇主是个疯子
Your employer? Your employer is insane.

227
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,640
即便如此 我也没别的事情可做
Be that as it may, I've got nothing else to go to.

228
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,450
那好吧 继续吧 罗杰斯
All right, then. Carry on, Rogers.

229
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,980
你知道他有枪吗?
Did you know he had a gun?

230
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,930
不知道
No.

231
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,520
停下 纳拉科特先生是个讲道理的人
Do stop. Mr Narracott seems a sensible man. 

232
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,630
他会来的
He'll be here.

233
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,710
不得不说 我现在才明白
I must say, I understand now

234
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,060
你在如此低水准的学校教书的原因
why you teach in such a substandard establishment.

235
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,580
我想大多数学校
I'm just observing that most schools 

236
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,410
都不想跟命案牵扯在一起
would not want to be associated with an inquest.

237
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,970
我不是在指责你 这些天互相指责已经够多了
I'm not accusing you. There's been quite enough of that already.

238
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,540
是的 太多了
Yes, there has. More than enough.

239
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,860
除了臭名昭著的隆巴德先生
Apart from the egregious Mr Lombard,

240
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,750
最可疑的罗杰斯
Rogers, who I find most dubious, 

241
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,060
还有堕落的马斯顿先生
and the depraved Mr Marston,

242
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,100
其它都是胡扯
it's all nonsense.

243
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,830
每个人不过是尽了自己的职责
Everyone was simply doing their duty.

244
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,470
就和我一样
As was I.

245
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,850
和你一样?
As were you?

246
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,050
你昨晚什么都没说吗?
You didn't say anything last night?

247
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,330
那不是能说给绅士听的
It wasn't for gentlemen's ears.

248
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,680
比阿特丽斯·泰勒是照料我的女佣
But Beatrice Taylor was my maid of all work.

249
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,320
弃婴
Foundling girl.

250
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,270
战时被抛弃的
An unwanted,

251
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,350
你懂吧?
from the war, you know?

252
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,210
我相信她是个干净 有礼貌 谦逊的女孩
I believed her to be a clean, decent, modest girl.

253
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,490
我教给她针线活
I taught her needlework skills.

254
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,440
我们像家人一样
We had quite the little home.

255
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,540
后来她惹上了麻烦
But then she got herself into trouble.

256
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,760
有了孩子什么的
The family way.

257
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,890
就和她放纵的母亲一样
As her own loose mother had with her.

258
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,580
她求我帮她
She begged me for help.

259
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,720
理所当然的 我拒绝了她
Naturally, and quite properly, I refused.

260
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
布伦特小姐 求你!
Miss Brent, please!

261
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,730
求求你!
I beg you!

262
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,690
她后来怎样了?
What happened to her?

263
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,550
她卧轨了
She threw herself under a train.

264
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,160
她自杀了?
She killed herself?

265
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
甚至上了当地报纸
Even made the local paper.

266
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,870
后来成了茶余饭后的故事
And they turned it into some pot-boiling sentimental tale.

267
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,760
她求你帮她
She asked you for help.

268
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,470
如果你帮了她...
If you had helped her...

269
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,640
是她性格中的软弱驱使她这么干的
It was the weakness in her character which drove her actions.

270
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,810
能怪我吗?
Why should I be reproached?

271
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,670
让罗杰斯泡些茶
Ask Rogers for some tea.

272
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,790
要柠檬 不加奶
Lemon, not milk.

273
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,670
这样四处乱找没用的 如果要我说的话
It's a wild goose chase, if you ask me.

274
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,420
成年人鬼鬼祟祟 东躲西藏的 太可笑了
Grown man hiding and sneaking about. It's ridiculous.

275
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,950
可马斯顿被下了氰化物的毒
Marston was given cyanide, though.

276
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,930
- 不是吗 胖子?  - 氰化物?
- Wasn't he, Tubs?  - Cyanide?

277
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,680
我很肯定
I'm pretty sure of it.

278
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,010
我不知道... 你早上的时候很肯定
I don't know... You were convinced of it this morning.

279
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,650
是克莱索恩下的毒 我打赌
Claythorne, for the cyanide. I'd put money on it.

280
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,790
她看起来不像那样的人
She don't seem the type.

281
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,090
她就是那样的人
No, she's exactly the type.

282
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,000
那个老头呢 将军?
What about the old boy, the general?

283
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,840
从那儿回来的人都很危险 懂吧
Dangerous men come back, you know, from over there,

284
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,340
脑子都糊涂了
their noggins all scrambled.

285
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,510
好吧 那我们搜查每一个人
Oh, well, let's search everybody, then.

286
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,650
痴迷上帝的布伦特小姐... 还得搜查沃格雷夫
God-bothering Miss Brent... Let's search Wargrave.

287
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,780
谁 那个法官?
What, the Judge?

288
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,140
出了名的死刑法官
Well-known as a Hanging Judge.

289
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,150
经常判人死刑
He's infamous for the black square.

290
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
据说他判的每一例死刑执行时他都会去看
The story goes that he'd watch every execution he'd ordered.

291
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,800
胖子 你整个早上都在偷看阿姆斯特朗
Tubs, you've been looking sideways at Armstrong all morning

292
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,580
而现在每个人都有嫌疑了
and now everyone's fair game.

293
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,910
你先怀疑法官的
You suggested the Judge.

294
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,980
我只是随口一说 欧文先生在岛上
I was taking the piss. Mr Owen is on the island.

295
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,530
我会找到他的
And I'm going to find him.

296
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,870
你别听他瞎说
You don't want to pay attention to what he said.

297
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,350
他只想把水搅浑
He's just stirring the shit pot.

298
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,890
可我还是会查清楚
Well, I can stir it right back.

299
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,350
别看
Don't look.

300
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,170
是被杀的吗?
Someone did this?

301
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,820
这是流血事件
Well, it weren't no bleedin' accident.

302
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,530

303
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,100
他说不会有人来的
He said no-one was coming for us.

304
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,740
他说这就是结局了
He said this was the end.

305
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,910
克莱索恩小姐
Miss Claythorne.

306
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,750
八个士兵小男孩 德文城里去猎奇
Eight little soldier boys travelling in Devon.

307
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,560
丢下一个命归西 八个只剩七

308

数数 法官

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,460
数数
Count them.

310
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,640

萨拉!

315
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,930
萨拉 快去!
Sarah!

316
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,790
克莱索恩小姐!

317
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,600
我只想离开!
I just want to go!

318
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,040
你会淹死的!
You'll drown!

319
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,390
拜托
Please.

320
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,970
求你了

我抓住你了
I've got you.

324
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,120
别害怕 没事的
Don't worry, it's all right.

325
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,040
我说过欧文就在岛上
I told you Owen was on the island.

326
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,570
你凭什么这么肯定?
What made you so sure?

327
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,930
直觉
Instinct. 

328
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,300
我们得理智些 按顺序来
We've got to be rational. Stick with procedure.

329
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
欧文先生是谁?
Who is this Owen?

330
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,810
还有欧文太太?
And Mrs Owen?

331
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,680
我觉得根本就没有欧文太太
I don't think there even is a Mrs Owen.

332
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,950
我们必然有什么共同点
We must all have something in common,

333
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,770
有人认识我们所有人
someone who knows us all.

334
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,230
那怎么可能?
Well, how can that be possible?

335
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,010
我能想象出认识医生...
I can imagine crossing paths with a doctor...

336
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,600
法官 可像隆巴德先生这样的人?
a judge, but someone like Mr Lombard?

337
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,130
现在我们都互相认识了 不是吗?
Well, we've crossed paths now. Haven't we?

338
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,740
隆巴德先生 布洛尔告诉我你有把手枪
Mr Lombard, Blore tells me that you have a revolver.

339
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,570
噢 胖子
Oh, Tubs.

340
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,530
你为什么有把枪?
Why have you got a gun?

341
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,500
他有把枪?
He's got a gun?

342
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,920
我去哪儿都带着
I carry it everywhere.

343
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,490
有人暗示说我会用到的
And it was implied that I might need it.

344
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,980
谁暗示你的?
Implied by whom?

345
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,330
我的客户需要一个能摆平局面的好手
My client needs a good man who can handle situations.

346
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,450
你客户是谁?
Who's your client?

347
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,940
欧文先生 尤利克·诺尔曼·欧文
Mr Owen. Ulick Norman Owen.

348
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,260
从没听说过他
Never heard of him.

349
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,940
可他听说过你
But he has heard of you.

350
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,850
奥德丽 把盒子拿来
Audrey, the box.

351
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,570
那很危险咯
It's dangerous, then.

352
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,890
我的客户相信会起事端
My client believes that it could become volatile.

353
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
我明白了
I see.

354
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,470
那么欧文先生打算要我怎么处理?
And how would Mr Owen wish me to proceed?

355
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,710
他相信你的判断
He leaves that to your discretion.

356
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,960
可提前警告你...
But forewarned is...

357
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,500
提前带上武器
Is fore-armed.

358
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,370
我明白了
I understand.

359
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,590
联系我说欧文太太雇佣我的也是那个人...
That's who got in touch with me about the job with Mrs Owen...

360
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,170
苏荷区的艾萨克·莫里斯
Isaac Morris in Soho.

361
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,880
苏荷区?
Soho?

362
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,050
欧文夫妇邀请我的 我从没听说过他们
I was invited here by the Owens, whom I've never heard of,

363
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,210
见一个共同的朋友...
to join a mutual friend...

364
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,870
卡尔明顿太太
Mrs Culmington.

365
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,300
据说这里休养身体的完美地点
The perfect place to recover, it said.

366
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,790
信封邮戳是伦敦苏荷区
The envelope was postmarked London, Soho.

367
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,810
道德沦丧
A sink of depravity. 

368
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,230
上帝都不眷顾的荒漠
A godless desert of vice.

369
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,190
你怎么会来这的 布伦特小姐?
What brings you here, Miss Brent?

370
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,910
欧文太太写信给我
Mrs Owen wrote to me.

371
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,760
她对我的工作感兴趣
She was interested in my work.

372
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,580
底层社会女孩的道德教育
The moral education of girls of the lower orders.

373
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,630
需要教给她们谦逊礼貌
They have to be taught modesty and decency,

374
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,510
否则社会就将被无尽的弃婴吞没了
or society will be drowned in a rising tide of unwanted babies.

375
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,090
全都嗷嗷待哺
All squalling to be fed.

376
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,600
她想捐助我的事业
She wanted to contribute to my cause.

377
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,830
布洛尔先生呢?
Blore?

378
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,330
我收到一封信 来自尤利克·诺尔曼·欧文先生
I got a letter. From Ulick Norman Owen.

379
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,280
他景仰我在警队的地位
He was impressed by my standing in the force.

380
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,110
他说如果我能设法过来花些时间
He said if I could see my way clear to spending some time,

381
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,060
盯着点 他会慷慨酬谢我的
keeping an eye out, that he'd recompense me generously.

382
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,860
盯着点什么?
Keeping an eye out for what?

383
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,250
他说有人冒名顶替来的
He said that someone was here under false pretences.

384
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,940
他还提供了宾客名单
He also supplied a list of guests.

385
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,750
所有人
All of you.

386
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,650
这儿的每个人
Everyone here.

387
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,470
他没说的是隆巴德有把枪!
What he didn't say was that Lombard would have a gun!

388
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,520
唱片上是欧文先生的声音吗?
Is it Mr Owen's voice on the record? 

389
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,850
有人认出来了吗?
Does anybody recognise it?

390
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,970
我们忘了这儿的枪了吗?
Are we forgetting about the gun here?

391
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,540
特么有个爱尔兰人带着枪呢!
There's a Fenian sat over there with a bloody gun!

392
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,970
- 别爆粗口!  - 交出来
- Don't blaspheme!  - Hand it over.

393
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,170
- 把枪交出来 隆巴德先生!  - 不可能
- Come on, surrender your weapon, Mr Lombard!  - Not a chance.

394
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,290
我能逼你交出来!
I could make you!

395
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,620
来试试啊
You can try.

396
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,850
艾萨克·莫里斯是欧文先生吗?
Is Isaac Morris Mr Owen?

397
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,150
不是
No.

398
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,300
否则我已经找到那个蠢货了
I'd have found that sweaty bucket of lard by now.

399
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,310
犹太人 不论何处有了问题
Jews. Wherever there's a problem,

400
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,530
都有犹太人在作怪
there's Jews at the bottom of it.

401
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,180
提醒我了
Something struck me.

402
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,070
不明白为何我以前没想到
I can't think why I didn't see it before.

403
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,740
尤利克·诺尔曼·欧文
Ulick Norman Owen.

404
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,400
尤纳·南希·欧文
Una Nancy Owen.

405
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,680
或者
Or..

406
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,220
U·N·欧文...
UN Owen...

407
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,500
就是佚名
is UNKNOWN.

408
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,650
也许是个谜语
It's a riddle, perhaps.

409
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,730
这什么意思?
What does it mean?

410
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,590
意味着隆巴德先生坚持认为
It means that Mr. Lombard is right to insist

411
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,770
凶手就在岛上是对的
that the killer is on the island.

412
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,190
他在外面肯定淋湿了
And he's getting very wet out there.

413
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,650
凶手不在外面
The killer's not out there.

414
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,300
凶手就在这
The killer is in here.

415
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,820
是我们中的一员
It is one of us.

416
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,550
这之前我们从未彼此见过 为何...
We've never met each other before now, why...

417
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,500
我怎么可能会杀人?
How could I possibly be capable?

418
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,730
谁都有可能 布伦特小姐
Oh, anyone is capable, Miss Brent.

419
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,370
40年来的判案教会了我这个道理
40 years on the criminal bench has taught me that.

420
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,260
- 罗杰斯  - 又来了 列出一个个嫌犯
- Rogers.  - Oh, here we go again. Lining up the next suspect.

421
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,320
记住我说的话 罗杰斯
You mark my words, Rogers.

422
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,030
他只不过是个油腔滑调的家伙
He's an oily bugger.

423
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,350
四处探头探脑
Slinking around.

424
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,550
晚餐时四处奔波
Going back and forth during dinner,

425
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,190
他有时间在马斯顿先生的酒水里加东西
he would have had time to put something into Mr. Marston's drink.

426
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,210
我听到他叫罗杰斯太太闭嘴
I heard him tell Mrs. Rogers to shut up.

427
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,670
她现在倒也是闭嘴了
Well, she's shut up now, isn't she?

428
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,410
就是他拿走瓷像的
He's the one moving the figures.

429
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,390
但是将军的死 其他人的死
But the General, the rest of us, 

430
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,790
那个录音 这个别墅 为什么?
that record, this house, why?

431
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,140
罗杰斯行事狡猾
Rogers has got low cunning running through him

432
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,890
就像布莱顿那片岩石一样不靠谱
like Brighton through a stick of rock. 

433
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,100
我们得盯着他
We need to watch him.

434
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,550
我对警察的所有信任
Any faith I ever had in the Thin Blue Line 

435
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,660
在遇到你的一瞬间都消失无踪了 胖子
evaporated the second I met you, Tubs.

436
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,080
你敢再那么叫我一遍
You call me that one more time mate,

437
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,260
- 再叫一遍...  - 你会怎样?
- one more time...  - And you'll what?

438
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,210
我们...
We...

439
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,000
都被盯上了
are all being hunted.

440
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,600
这个岛上还有其他人
There's someone else on this island

441
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,370
等我找到他
and when I find him,

442
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,330
我就让他做我手下第22个亡魂
I'm going to make him number 22,

443
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,990
一枪毙了他
with a bullet right there.

444
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,150
天啊
Oh, God.

445
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,110
你怎么可以这么轻易地... 说出口?
How can you say that... so easily?

446
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,500
我一张嘴就说出来了
I just open my mouth and it comes out.

447
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,640
我看一看晚饭能吃什么
I'll see what can be done about supper.

448
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,050
还有些肝和腰子
There's some livers and kidneys.

449
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,200
也许可以做个派 上面浇点酱汁
Perhaps a pie with some good gravy.

450
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,510
那一定很美味 罗杰斯
That would be delicious, Rogers.

451
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,410
谢谢
Thank you.

452
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,090
谢谢你 罗杰斯
Thank you, Rogers.

453
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,010
他做的派我一口都不会吃
Well, I ain't eating a mouthful of his pie.

454
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,480
晚安
Well, goodnight.

455
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,580
相信上帝
Trust in God.

456
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,550
但是我们也可以...
But perhaps also...

457
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,090
把门锁好
we should lock our doors.

458
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,300
耶和华是我的牧者 我将一无所求
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

459
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,020
他使我躺卧在青草地上
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures,

460
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,360
领我在可安歇的水边...
he leadeth me besides the still waters...

461
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,530
他使我的灵魂苏醒 为他的名引导我走义路
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

462
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,270
我虽然行过...
Yay, though I walk through...

463
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,070
死荫的幽谷
the valley of the shadow of death...

464
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,790
也不怕遭害 因为你与我同在
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

465
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,300
不怕遭害
I will fear no evil.

466
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,120
不怕遭害 因为你与我同...
I will fear no evil for thou art...

467
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,580
不怕遭害 因为你与我同在...
I will fear no evil, thou art with me...

468
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,380
都起来!
Get up!

469
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,730
都起来!
Get up!

470
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,150
都起来!
Get up!

471
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,820
都起来!
Get up!

472
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,850
我刚才在找他
I was looking for him.

473
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,900
我想要杯咖啡 我看了一下...
I wanted a coffee. I looked...

474
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,630
然后看到了这个
and I found this.

475
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,890
不是我干的
It wasn't me.

476
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,930
我只不过想要一杯咖啡 不是我干的...
I just wanted a damn coffee, it wasn't me...

477
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,690
他死了一整晚了
He's been here all night.

478
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,670
七个士兵小男孩 伐树砍枝不顺手
Seven little soldiers chopping up sticks,

479
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,630
斧劈两半一命休 七个只剩六
one chopped himself in half and then there were six.

480
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,920
所以她说得对
So she's right.

481
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,400
和那首诗一样
It is the poem,

482
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,060
但是他错了 欧文无名先生
but he's fucked, Mr Unknown Owen,

483
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,990
六个士兵小男孩 玩弄蜂房惹蜂怒
because six little solder boys played with a hive.

484
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,990
飞来一蛰命呜呼 六个只剩五
A bumble bee stung one and then there were five

485
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,180
这里根本没有蜂房 也没有蜜蜂
and there is no hive here and there are no bees,

486
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,550
所以你准备怎么办 欧文无名先生? 你错了!
so what are you going to do now, Mr Unknown Owen? You're fucked!

487
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,870
你错...
You're fu...

488
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,320
我去穿衣服
I will get dressed,

489
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,150
我们都去穿衣服...
we will all get dressed...

490
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,500
然后我去泡咖啡
and I will make coffee.

491
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,220
- 布伦特小姐 我们走吧?  - 好的
- Miss Brent, shall we?  - Yes.

492
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,110
该死 真该死
Shit. Shit the bed.

493
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,250
我们得找点东西把他包起来
We need to find something to wrap him up with

494
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,910
不然到处都是血
or he's going to go everywhere.

495
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,400
咖啡
Coffee.

496
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,270
恐怕没有牛奶了
There's no milk, I'm afraid.

497
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,830
这个人是不是...
Does this person...

498
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,700
要杀掉所有人?
mean to kill us all?

499
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,080
我猜是的
I believe so, yes.

500
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,200
我丢了一个毛线球
I've lost a ball of wool.

501
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,550
我为此很懊恼
I'm quite ridiculously distressed about it.

502
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,170
只是个毛线球...
It's only wool...

503
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,340
我太累了
I'm so very tired.

504
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,000
把咖啡喝完 布伦特小姐
Drink your coffee, Miss Brent.

505
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
我给你拿个蜡烛过来照明
I'll bring you a candle to see by.

506
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,210
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

507
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,650
我再去泡些咖啡
I'll make some more.

508
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,410
沃格雷夫法官 我觉得我...
Judge Wargrave, I feel I...

509
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,930
该向你道歉...
owe you an apology for...

510
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,120
我不该那么不可饶恕地告诉大家你的疾病
exposing your illness in such an unforgiveable fashion.

511
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,460
大家都有点失控了 可以理解
We're all feeling a little ragged. Understandably.

512
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,020
你对其他人有什么看法?
What's your opinion of the others?

513
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,170
我没有看法
I haven't really formed one.

514
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,060
我谁都不相信
I don't trust any of them.

515
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,430
布洛尔 隆巴德那个混蛋 克莱索恩
Blore. That bastard Lombard. Claythorne.

516
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,010
布伦特小姐和她那对宗教的狂热
Miss Brent and her religious mania.

517
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,400
但是你和我...
But you and I...

518
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,850
都有犀利的头脑
we have sharp minds.

519
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,440
都很有智慧
Actual intellects.

520
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,130
我们应该待在一起
We should stay together.

521
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,720
好的
Very well.

522
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,980
天...
Oh, Go...

523
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,160
给你 给你
Here. Here.

524
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
多谢
Thank you.

525
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,010
和小孩子一样弄得到处都是
Dribbling down myself like a child.

526
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,530
克莱索恩小姐在做咖啡...
Miss Claythorne's making the coffee...

527
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,170
得有人看着她
she should be watched.

528
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,070
对
Right.

529
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,780
你把台阶弄干净
You do the stairs,

530
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,930
我去把柴房地板上的内脏弄干净
I'm going to wash the guts out of the woodstore.

531
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,480
我来吧?
Can I?

532
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,860
我很喜欢做家务
I rather enjoy domestic tasks.

533
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,470
很舒缓
They are soothing.

534
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,130
平和
Normal.

535
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,570
的确
Indeed.

536
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,780
我马上回来
I'll just be a moment.

537
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,010
好的
All right.

538
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,790
蜜蜂一蛰
Stung by a bee.

539
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,050
六个只剩五
And then there were five.

540
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,770
我想 罗杰斯死了 得我来想午餐吃什么了
Well, I suppose, with no Rogers, I should think about lunch.

541
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,960
我已经饿得要死了
I could eat a scabby horse.

542
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,180
你真的饿了?
You're actually hungry?

543
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,060
我干了重活... 处理罗杰斯的尸体
That was heavy work... dealing with Rogers.

544
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,990
你提议吃午餐了
And you're the one that suggested lunch.

545
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,590
只因为一般都是这个点吃午餐
Only because it's what one does at this time of day,

546
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,080
但是我不饿 你怎么就饿了?
but I'm not hungry, how could you possibly be hungry?

547
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,840
喂 你!
Oi, you!

548
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,850
别瞎暗示...
Don't go implying...

549
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,680
诽谤我... 我和
Casting aspersions... I've got not,

550
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,190
我和这事没关系
I've got nothing to do with this.

551
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,740
我和这一点关系都没有
I've got nothing to do with any of it.

552
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,390
只不过因为我饿了
Just because I said I was hungry.

553
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,500
我确实饿了 这根本证明不了什么!
I am hungry, it doesn't prove a single thing!

554
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,700
我去换衣服
I'm going to get dressed.

555
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,540
我整个早晨
The whole morning,

556
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,120
拖着罗杰斯的尸体 清理内脏
dragging Rogers around, clearing up guts,

557
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,020
忙的连喝杯茶尿个尿的时间都没有 而你...
without so much as a cup of tea to wet me whistle, and you..

558
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,370
- 你看着我的样子就像...  - 冷静
- you look at me like I...  - Calm down.

559
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,040
你有种 女人
You've got some front, love.

560
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,410
你胆子还真够大的
You've got some right brass neck.

561
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,260
别一个人下楼
Don't go downstairs on your own.

562
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,540
除非有那俩陪着你
Not with those two.

563
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,100
谁 沃格雷夫和阿姆斯特朗?
What, Wargrave and Armstrong? 

564
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,060
你在这里等我
You wait up here for me.

565
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,860
房间是锁着的 所以一定有主钥匙
It was locked. Which means there must be a master key.

566
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,330
罗杰斯一定有主钥匙
Rogers must have had a master key.

567
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,270
- 是你们俩处理他的尸体的!  - 是你发现的!
- You two dealt with the body!  - And you found it!

568
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,000
还是说根本是你杀的?
Or did you?

569
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,240
你跟女人似的尖叫
You shrieking like a woman,

570
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,770
那可不是什么成熟的表现吧?
was that a bit of amateur dramatics, was it?

571
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,500
我没有杀罗杰斯
I did nothing to Rogers.

572
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,910
也没有拿走什么主钥匙
I didn't take any master key,

573
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,820
我们根本不知道到底有没有那钥匙
we don't even know if there is a master key,

574
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,800
我们只知道你说枪被偷了
and we only had your word that the gun was stolen,

575
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,320
- 也许就是你偷的  - 我干嘛要偷自己的枪?
- you could've taken it.  - Why would I steal my own gun?

576
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,640
我不知道你为什么要做这些事 隆巴德
I don't know why you'd do anything, Lombard, 

577
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,030
我不知道你为什么要杀
I don't know why you killed 

578
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,550
罗杰斯 布伦特小姐 麦克阿瑟
Rogers or Miss Brent or MacArthur.

579
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,990
- 我没有杀他们  - 你的确可以这么说 对吧?
- I didn't kill them.  - Well, you would say that, wouldn't you?

580
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,050
就像你说你的枪被偷了一样
Just like you'd say that your gun was stolen.

581
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,870
你真是个顶级
You really are a first-class,

582
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,400
五星级
five-star,

583
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,220
闪闪特么发光的白痴
solid gold fucking moron.

584
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,430
拜托! 还有女士在场!
Please! The lady!

585
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,450
虚实并用的骗术
Double bluff.

586
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,110
什么 胖子?
What, Tubs?

587
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,090
你为什么要偷自己的枪 阿姆斯特朗说得对
Why you would steal your own gun. Armstrong's got a point.

588
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,390
这都是谜题把戏 烟幕弹和镜花水月 就是虚实并用的骗术
It's all riddles and games, smoke and mirrors, double bluff.

589
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,910
你是最后一个下楼的人
You were the last one down.

590
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,300
最后一个
The last one.

591
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,560
比其他人晚了很多
Ages behind everyone else.

592
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,810
什么事耽误了你那么久?
What, what took you so long?

593
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,100
我不想说
I don't care to say.

594
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,220
你杀了罗杰斯
You killed Rogers.

595
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,100
你拿走了主钥匙 上床睡觉
You took the master key, you went to bed,

596
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,870
确保我们都下了楼
you made sure all of us were downstairs,

597
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,600
然后去了我的房间 拿走了我的枪
then you got in my room and took my gun.

598
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,950
我的枪在你手上 你个蠢货
You have my gun, you little prick.

599
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,300
隆巴德! 注意用词
Lombard! For heaven's sake.

600
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,450
我没杀罗杰斯
I never killed Rogers and

601
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,750
也没拿钥匙和你的枪!
I ain't got your key or your sodding gun!

602
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,630
那你为什么那么慢?
Then what took you so long?

603
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,860
如果你不是在我房间里偷枪的话
If you weren't in my room, stealing my gun,

604
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,440
怎么会是最后一个到的?
then why were you last down?

605
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,270
你非要问的话 我在蹲厕所!
I was in the bloody lavvy, if you must know!

606
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,940
