202, 203.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,935
Hi, Manny!

23
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,937
Hi, Therese.

24
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:57,719
Frank...!

25
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,489
Wake up!

26
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:01,291
Frank, come on, I have
something wonderful

27
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,792
to tell you.

28
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:06,797
Hurry, I've had an epiphany!

29
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,666
Frank...

30
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:12,370
...Do you know
what this is?

31
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:13,805
Eggplant?

32
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,574
Liberation.

33
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:18,477
No, no, no.

34
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,912
Rebirth.

35
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:21,214
Not with all
the king's vaseline.

36
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,049
Freedom!

37
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,051
That won't fit.
Frank...

38
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,152
Fuck you, Gallagher.

39
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,656
I made it all the way

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,361
to Manny's produce truck
today-- 214 steps.

41
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:37,399
I went to just do my extra
ten steps, and then I saw

42
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,670
the eggplant
and the rows of beets

43
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,739
and the organic squash,

44
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:46,377
and I just kept going.

45
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,446
Manny's pushing organic now?

46
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:52,917
This is just the start.

47
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,752
The scourge of gentrification.

48
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,888
Next he'll be Hawking
that coffee grown in cat shit.

49
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,122
Frank,

50
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,757
I am shopping,

51
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,727
I am part of the economy,

52
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,262
I am myself again.

53
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,197
Here we go.

54
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,433
Today...

55
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:12,903
A grocery truck,
tomorrow the world.

56
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,714
- It's over.
- I always thought agoraphobia

57
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:27,317
was permanent,
like autism or aids.

58
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,452
She'll be out in the world,
she'll go back to work,

59
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:30,720
she'll learn the truth.

60
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:32,489
That you're a raging alcoholic?

61
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:33,490
Who owes money to everyone?

62
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:34,491
Who's had sex
with her daughter?

63
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,560
It's not sex if you
can't remember it.

64
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,929
Well, then you're a virgin, Frank.

65
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:41,132
Gonna be out on my butt
in weeks.

66
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,434
Why don't you just live at your
real home with your real family?

67
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:46,270
I don't like them
and they don't like me.

68
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,639
Frank squatted at my
place for six months.

69
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,174
Finally bought tear gas,

70
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,409
- smoked him out.
- I gave myself crabs

71
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:52,910
to get him out of my place.

72
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,145
It wasn't the crabs,

73
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:55,513
it was your empty fridge.

74
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,781
Laugh, laugh.

75
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,016
If laughing at me is good

76
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,784
for your self-worth, laugh on.

77
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,019
My gift.

78
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,854
Kevin. Yo, Antoine.

79
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:05,289
Hurt me with some rum.

80
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,291
Delivering meals
on drunk wheels again?

81
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,293
Only one delivery left.

82
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,293
Go do it and come back.

83
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,429
My last delivery
is to Dottie Coronis.

84
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:14,197
I can walk there from here.

85
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,666
What's wrong with butterface?
Don't call her that.

86
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,135
I haven't seen her in a while.

87
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,603
W-why's she pretending
to be sick?

88
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,139
She's hiding her face from
children till Halloween.

89
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,207
God gave her one hell

90
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:25,275
of a rack and legs
to die for, though.

91
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,445
But her face!

92
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,282
You're all going to hell.

93
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,684
What's wrong with butterface?

94
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:34,352
She had chronic indigestion.

95
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:36,887
From her steady diet
of bourbon and dick.

96
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,322
She got it checked,

97
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:40,790
discovered she had a
bunch of heart attacks.

98
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,025
Her heart muscle is toast.

99
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:45,328
Months to live
unless she gets a new one.

100
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,863
Shit.

101
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,631
All those years of paying
into a city pension

102
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,033
and no one left to collect.

Liam, if you want a popsicle,

111
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,494
show me your hands.

112
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,497
Liam, hands off your package
or no treat.

113
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,666
Touching it is his treat.

114
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,436
I need my own room
without Liam.

115
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,004
I'm late for work.

116
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,840
Carl, quit it.
I can't share a room

117
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,376
with someone in a
constant state of arousal.

118
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,377
I'm going to be a woman soon.

119
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:39,446
Hey, enough.

120
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,847
Frank's been gone for months.

121
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,282
You move into Frank's room,

122
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,585
Lip takes yours, Ian and
Carl share with Liam.

123
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,886
Frank will be back.

124
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:48,222
In bed by midnight--
No exceptions.

125
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,203
Here he comes.
You know, you didn't have to come with me.

126
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,805
Bad neighborhood.
We live in a bad neighborhood.

127
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,973
Yeah, but we're related to the bad
people in our bad neighborhood.

128
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,908
The hell's he doing here?

129
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,243
Hey, Mick.

130
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,411
He thought I needed protection.

131
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,045
Oh, yeah?
Trust me, you may think

132
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,481
you know my sister,
but you don't know my sister

133
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:16,916
until you've fought my sister.

134
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,051
She's protecting your ass.
You smell like barbecue sauce.

135
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,453
Smell like what?
Oh, ow!

136
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:23,322
What did dad tell you?
Ow! Fuck the police?

137
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,291
No titty twisters now
that I'm a C cup. Ow.

138
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,959
C cup?
Bitch, you wish.

139
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:29,128
Hey,

140
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,965
fuck you, fuck you,
and especially fuck you.

141
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,733
All right, Jesus,
let's get out of here

142
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,769
before they throw you back in.

143
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:54,084
Who the hell is it?

144
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:57,087
It's Frank Gallagher, Dottie.

145
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,490
Get off my property.

146
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,659
I brought your pasta primavera.

147
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,761
Eat shit, Frank.

148
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:05,764
Well, I-I would,
but I recently went vegan.

149
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,375
Honestly, Dottie, Antoine
told us your news.

150
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,378
I've had some health
setbacks myself.

151
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,881
Wanted to tell you the crew
at the bar's thinking of you.

152
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:24,283
Thought I'd bring your dinner
over and tell you in person.

153
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,452
No lasagna left?

154
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,121
I grabbed the last one he had.

155
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,457
Enjoying your night?

156
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,858
I'm watching one of those

157
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,194
fat-people-hate-themselves-
for-being-fat shows.

158
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,695
Makes me feel healthy.

159
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:36,996
I love that show.

160
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,331
I hate fat people.

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,468
Did you hear a beep?

162
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,871
Oh, guy locking his car.

163
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:47,041
Look, I'm missing my show.

164
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,177
Mind if I join you?

165
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,546
I haven't showered
and I'm not gonna.

166
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,581
Makes two of us.

167
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,816
And it's not
an invitation to stay.

168
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,920
Couch, fat people show, leave.

169
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:01,655
I'm not a bed and breakfast.

170
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,390

171
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,162

Desperate whore-wife is

193
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,315
Can you say that again

Hey, baby.
Hi, David.

Hello, David.

203
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:15,963
Looking sharp.
Jazz says

204
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:17,331
I'm springing for Cristal,

205
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:18,933
or I'm going home alone.

206
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,403
Oh, we don't want you
to be lonely tonight, do we, V?

207
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:24,773

So, I'm taking geometry, algebra
two, trigonometry, chemistry.

211
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:37,921
During the summer?

212
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,057
Well, I'm trying to
get into west point.

213
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:43,160
If you want the army
to give you a fucking gun,

214
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:44,628
all you got to do is enlist.

215
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:46,697
Recruiting station's,
like, two blocks that way.

216
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,365
I want to be an officer.

217
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,901
Want to be an officer, huh?

218
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:54,170
Don't officers get shot first?

219
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,239
Here.

220
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:58,809
Shotgun.

221
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,793
Oh.

222
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,630
So you make a lot of
friends on the inside?

00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,699
You want to chitchat
more, or you want to get on me?

224
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:28,705
Plasma?
Led. Shh.

225
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,673
I never feared
taking my shirt off at the beach.

226
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,309
But then I saw this footage
my daughter shot of me...

227
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,479
Nice picture.

228
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,980
...And I just broke down.
Vibrant.

229
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:39,149
Can I watch my program, please?

230
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,518
How did I become so disgusting?

231
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,254
And sit in the chair.

232
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,689
I don't want you
stretching out on the couch

233
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:48,327
and rip van winkling it
for the next five years.

234
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,332
Did you hear a beep?

235
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,735
Smoke alarm battery is dying.

236
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,237
If they find a heart,

237
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,038
they're supposed
to beep me on this thing.

238
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,175
It means I go straight
to the hospital.

239
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,946
They got to find different
sounds for different things.

240
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,548
Everything beeps.

241
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,352
Smoke alarms, hearing aids,
microwaves, cell phones.

242
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:15,521
I'm gonna have a heart attack
waiting for my heart transplant.

243
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:16,956
You got a nine-volt battery?

244
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:18,691
I can change that for you.

245
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,693
In the junk drawer
under the microwave.

246
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:25,396
...But then I would gorge
and binge, yet not purge.

247
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,398
I didn't have a disorder.

248
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,034
I just had a disgusting habit
of eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

253
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:42,912

starving by now.

Instead of worrying
about making money,

273
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:43,040
we'll be spending theirs.
Not into married guys.

274

I never said he was married.
Meet him!

275
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:48,213
Before you know it,
your shit will start sagging,

276
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,815
leg veins will pop up,
and you won't be able to screw

277
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,417
without handfuls of astroglide.

278
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,852
I'm 21.
It doesn't make you a kept woman.

279
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,187
It makes you a smart one.

Uh, another time.

284
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:03,862
You asked about Richard?

285
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,030
She's thinking about it.

commissioner

293
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,678
who kicked me off my baseball
team for pissing on first base.

294
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,913
I remember.

295
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,416
You heard about that?

296
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,118
I was playing second.

298
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,292
Mm.

299
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,805
Not much to do
in the joint but work out.

300
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,373
You could read.

301
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:57,011
Fuck off.
Fucked for life anyway, man.

302
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,180

Nah, man.
I got to get me a job.

304

If I don't get one
in two weeks,

305
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,319
my probation skank's
gonna do it for me,

306
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,354
and I'm gonna end up
losing a fucking limb

307
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,855
at the meat packing plant.

308
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,557
Maybe she'll find
you something better.

309
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,058
She ain't gonna find fuck all.

310
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,960
My dad even had
to threaten this mook he knows

311
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,862
from high school
to get me a job tarring roofs.

312
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,798
Maybe you could head
down to Malcolm X.

313
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,567
You know, take some
vocational training.

314
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,035
Why the fuck are we talking

315
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,470
about community college
right now?

316
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,906
Jesus Christ, you want us
to spread a blanket out

317
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,508
and look
for shooting stars next?

318
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,014
I could talk to Linda.

319
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,650
I'm sorry. You want me to work
at the place I got shot?

320
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,552
Redemption tale.

321
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,153
What would I be doing?
Helping.

322
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,222
I ain't cleaning up
after people.

323
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,990
It's a pretty clean
store, Mickey.

324
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,226
What about security?

325
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,995
You know, scaring people like me
who come into the store

326
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,596
trying to steal shit?

327
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,664
Stealing's been down
since your shooting.

328
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,066
Hey, do whatever you want, man.

329
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,201
You brought it up.

330
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,902
All right.

331
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:58,873
You ready to go again, or you,
uh, need some time, fire crotch?

332
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,276
Okay.

333
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,810
How's Jody?

334
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,311
He's good.

335
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:36,213
As good as me?

336
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,882
We're still not having sex.

337
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:38,916
Right, 'cause his name's Jody.

338
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,321
Is that a, uh, real name
or a nickname?

339
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,456
You know, isn't it kind of

340
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:46,958
creepy that a guy
who's twice your age

341
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,459
keeps hanging around you,

342
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,061
but hasn't tried
to get in your pants yet?

343
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,631
You two getting serious?

344
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,766
Stop talking about my boyfriend
and fuck me.

345
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,737
Smoke alarm working,
fan back up to speed.

346
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,405
What now?

347
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,842
I could give you some rope
to hang yourself from it,

348
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,310
or you could just leave.

349
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,312
How's your daughter? Same.

350
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,481
Any complications
from that skin graft?

351
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:14,118
Haven't talked since
she moved to Sweden.

352
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,753
What the hell's
she doing in Sweden?

353
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,489
Avoiding me.

354
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:20,524
I'm off to bed.

355
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,760
Bed?! It's 11:00!

356
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:25,629
You used to close
the alibi every night.

357
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:27,498
Used to do lots of things.

358
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:29,934
Anything else I can do for you?

359
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,936
What's the deal, Frank?

360
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,472
What, did Sheila Jackson
finally throw you out?

361
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:36,973
Just offering my services.

362
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:39,275
Stocking up on your
corporal works of mercy?

363
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,544
One friend helping out another.

364
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:45,847
The upstairs bathroom's
clogged pretty bad.

365
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,783
I could lie and say it was roots
growing in the pipes,

366
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,952
but it's all me, and a half
dozen of those adult wipes.

367
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,821
I never used those wipes myself.

368
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,322
Thought they were
an extravagance.

369
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:57,324
Little did I know
how nice it feels

370
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,826
to Polish things up down there.

371
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,201
Let yourself out.

372
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:10,370
There's nothing worth
stealing you can carry.

373
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,580
Mother of God!

374
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,760
Jesus.

375
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,773
Shit!

376
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:49,875
Oh, shit!

377
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,114
Want to go to a rave
up in lake forest this weekend?

378
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:56,916
If I hated myself.

379
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,951
Jody knows a guy,
Henry Woodhouse,

380
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:00,753
who can send out
a tweet and get

381
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:03,756
over a thousand people to show
anywhere in less than two hours.

382
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,424
It's like a flash mob,
but more fun.

383
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,927
Excepting the fact that
it's in lake forest

384
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:10,363
and lake forest kids are there.

385
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:13,031
You want to do something
tomorrow night?

386
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,067
Probably watching
<i>Wipeout</i> with Jody.

387
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:16,434
He loves that show.

388
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,803
People running around,
wiping out.

389
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,873
"Big Balls!"
It's hilarious.

390
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,375
We make popcorn and laugh.
Yeah,

391
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,243
it sounds like a
crazy summer night.

392
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:29,614
We're keeping each other company
trying to avoid familiar patterns.

393
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,716
Mm-hmm. And, um...

394
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,253
How do you characterize this?

395
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,922
Helps me sleep.

396
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,359
Text me when he
leaves, all right?

397
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,601
You sleeping here now?

398
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,803
Uh, no, just leaving, actually.

399
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,605
Good to see you, son.

400
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,877
GFY, dad.

401
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,927
Shit.

00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:42,918
I rent room.

Frank give me key.

409
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,523
Have baby.

410
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,447
Got time for my legs?
I got to drive old people

411
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:14,049
around the city all day--
Too hot out for stubbly legs.

412

Old people excursion day? Yay!

Do me a favor and kill me

Will do.

415
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:21,891
In my community,

416
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:23,760
if one of the elders
felt that they were

417
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,729
too much of a burden,
they would wander out

418
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:29,800
into the snow and give
themselves to the elements.

419
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,802
You come from twisted stock.

420
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:34,272
All righty, I'm all lathered.

421
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,073
Have at it.

422
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,275
You know, this Jody douche

423
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:40,077
has hair that's
longer than Fiona's.

424
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:41,979
And he has a motorcycle
with a luggage compartment.

425
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,480
Yeah. Test me on
the theorems.

426
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:46,482
If A equals B,
then b equals a...

427
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,617
Symmetric.
You might as well

428
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,319
get a windshield
and call it a car.

429
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:50,353
A equals A.

430
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:51,654
Reflexive.

431
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:52,922
Maybe it's just a phase.

432
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,590
You know, she hasn't
even slept with him yet.

433
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,425
What's next?

434
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,261
Maybe he's a eunuch.

435
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,595
Maybe she just likes him.

436
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,666
Lip, why are you sleeping in my bed?
Ask her.

437
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,469
I moved Liam.
I can't be in the same room

438
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,438
where Liam is
constantly masturbating.

439
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:08,806
It's not masturbating

440
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:09,841
if nothing comes out.

441
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,309
According to whom?

442
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:12,444
My friend Jack O'Donnell.

443
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,712
Not true.

444
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:15,114
It's kind of true.

445
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:16,282
Not legally true.

446
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:17,516
Liam can be arrested

447
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,985
for masturbating?
No. Listen up.

448
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,187
What <i>is</i> the demarcation age

449
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,855
where it's officially
inappropriate

450
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:24,056
to arouse yourself
in front of others,

451
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,391
even if nothing comes out?

452
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:26,392
Two years old.

453
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:27,560
Hey, Gallaghers!

454
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:28,995
I need focus

455
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:30,463
and cooperation.

456
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:32,832
Okay, unfortunately Frank
has rented out his room

457
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,066
to a pregnant woman.

458
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:35,134
I already told them.

459
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,202
You let her in last night?

460
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:37,570
She let herself in.

461
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:38,671
She has a key.

462
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:40,473
Besides, she's from China.

463
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:42,141
They kill extra babies there.

464
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:44,010
Liam needs
to go back in with you.

465
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:45,211
No!
Debbie.

466
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:47,314
What's done is done!

467
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:52,685
Okay.

468
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,889
For now, Liam's in
the boys' room with the boys.

469
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,924
What?
Four guys in one room?

470
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,825
Isn't that a health code violation?
I'll find Frank

471
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,028
and figure this out, but
until then, four in the room.

472
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:18,577
Five hundred.

473
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:20,179
Five hun...

474
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,180
Frank...

475
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,381
Frank...

476
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:25,117
It's 500 more steps.

477
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:26,719
500 more steps,

478
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:27,753
sweetie!

479
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:29,422
And I get to the "L."

480
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:30,957
Honey.

481
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:32,959
And I can maybe get my job back

482
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:35,062
at St. Stephen's cafeteria,

483
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:37,097
sweetie, and go off disability.

484
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:38,365
Frank!

485
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,133
Isn't that exciting?

486
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,135
Do you want to walk
with me today?

487
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,470
Got to work.

488
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,574
Those are Eddie's tools.

489
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:49,209
Yes, they are.

490
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:53,780
Hello?

491
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,383
Oh. Oh, hi, Fiona.
He's right here.

492
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:57,584
It's Fiona.

493
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,952
What now?

494
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:01,087
Somebody just dropped
off $200 for you.

495
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:03,256
Said he owed you, and thanks.
Who?

496
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,592
- Unshaven, flannel shirt.
- What happened?

497
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:07,461
Cauliflower ear.
Tommy Armada?

498
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:09,062
I'm leaving $50 for
you on the mantel,

499
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,431
but I'm buying groceries

501
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,667
Bravo.

Debbie?

903
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,652
I brought some artwork
from the kids

904
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:15,421
for ginger and Harry.

905
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:19,792

906
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,794

And then I'm taking everyone
to the Indian casino.

912
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,266
Ooh, thank you.

913
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,667
Mm-hmm.

914
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,204
You went to high school
with this Craig Heisner?

915
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,440
He's hot.
You should poke him.

916
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:11,774
Fuck Facebook.

917
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,377
I'll poke him for you,
if you want.

918
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,445
What are you doing?

919
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,446
Sending him a message.

920
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,447
Don't!

921
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,616
Did. Sent him your number.

922
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,151
What's the opposite
of "thank you"?

923
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,986
Hey, guys!
Hey.

924
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,023
I can get laid on my own.
He's cute, huh?

925
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,859
Richard, hi!

926
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,494
Hey. Good to see you.
You, too.

927
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,197
Fiona, this is Richard,
who you wanted to meet.

928
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:34,498
Hi, Richard.

929
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:35,733
Hi.

930
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,068
Shall we begin with
some appletinis?

931
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,838
I'll put the order in right now.

932
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:48,579
Want to watch the lotto numbers?

933
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:55,019
That's enough
of a visit for today.

934
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,021
Finish the list tomorrow.

935
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,360
Wait.

936
00:46:03,395 --> 00:46:05,329
I want you.

937
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:09,934
Frank.

938
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,435
How is it
that I never had this?

939
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,070
Stop.

940
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:16,908
Two drunken ships passing
in a harbor swill hole.

941
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:18,343
We'll make up for lost time.

942
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:23,581
Frank, I can't have sex.

943
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:25,349
Okay?

944
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:26,918
I'm not thrilled about it.

945
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:29,587
The one thing I'm good at,
I can't do.

946
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,722
We'll go slowly.

947
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:31,722
Oh, I don't know slow.

948
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:32,757
I'll teach you.

949
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,258
Frank!

950
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,761
I haven't exactly lived
a life of restraint.

951
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:40,064
I can't push it while
I'm waiting for my transplant.

952
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,767
If my bp goes above 120/80,

953
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,602
my heart explodes.

954
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,871
Don't you get it?

955
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:49,407
If we fuck, I die.

956
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:54,545
♪ Licky like a rock star ♪

957
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,581

958
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,484
Hey, Gary.

959
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,253
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.

960
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,329
You had no interest in my
showing up tonight, did you?

961
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:12,264
What'd she tell you?

962
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:16,001
Uh, that you, uh, saw a photo
and couldn't wait to meet me.

963
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:17,502
I saw no photo.

964
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:18,637
She has no photo.

965
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,107
So, why'd you come?

966
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,842
Well, my company does about

967
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,677
$250 million worth of business
with David's company.

968
00:47:25,711 --> 00:47:27,846
And he's fond of Jasmine.

969
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,348
I didn't want to be the one
to upset the concubine.

970
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:33,284
So how much longer do you think
we need to keep talking

971
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:36,320
to each other to make it seem
like we really gave it a shot?

972
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,856
I don't know, two or
three more minutes.

973
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:40,091
Tops.

974
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,796
You want to see a
photo of me now?

975
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:45,331
I'm good.

976
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,966
Fully decent.

977
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:49,636
It's me in grade school,
after I lost my first tooth.

978
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,505
That style is coming back.

979
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,173
Did it ever arrive?

980
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,174
With the Iroquois.

981
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:57,644
And, uh, punk rock.

982
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:01,949
So, how does this
arrangement work?

983
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:06,353
I dress pretty,
hang on your arm,

984
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:08,789
we have sex
a couple times a month,

985
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:10,691
then you give me credit cards

986
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:12,860
to buy shit that I like
but don't need?

987
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:14,562
I have no idea.

988
00:48:14,596 --> 00:48:16,864
I'm just here
'cause I was invited.

989
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,499
I don't make it a habit of

990
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,800
hanging around women
that don't have

991
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:21,369
any interest in being with me.

992
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:23,571
You think you always know?

993
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:25,540
Well, how does
anybody know anything?

994
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:28,543
I mean, if I'm not laughing
and the woman's not laughing,

995
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:30,978
that's a good sign
that it's not working.

996
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:32,881
But if we're both smiling?

997
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:35,384
There are worse ways
to spend an evening.

998
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:36,885
You're not married?

999
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,854
What do you got
against married guys?

1000
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,222
I'm not into liars.

1001
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:42,257
Well, they're not lying to you.

1002
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:48,230
Night, Richard.

1003
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:50,665
You should go get that Mohawk.

1004
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:53,534
Could restart the trend.

1005
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,270
