1
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:02,993
给你
Here you go.

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,728
希望你好好享受这顿晚饭 还有我的表演
And I hope you enjoyed dinner and the show.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,323
就是我假装我在这里当服务员很开心
The show being me pretending I'm happy as a waitress.

4
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,133
Caroline Max在哪?
Caroline, where is Max?

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,936
我已经把十八层地狱都翻了个遍
And I've already checked the bowels of hell.

6
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:15,342
是啊 我知道我在什么鬼地方工作
Yeah, I know where I work.

7
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,341
Max今天得迟到了
Max is going to be late today

8
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,475
因为她被困在地铁上了
'cause she got stuck on the subway.

9
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,776
但昨天你也说她迟到
But you said yesterday she was late

10
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:21,912
是因为她被困在地铁上了
because she was stuck on the subway.

11
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:26,483
不对吧 我记得我昨天说的是她被卡在地铁轮子下面了
No, I believe I said yesterday she got stuck under the subway.

12
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,318
Oleg 来帮帮忙
Oleg, a little help.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,586
哦 你说Max?
Oh, Max?

14
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,555
她今天被困在公交车上了
Today she got stuck on a bus.

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:34,958
你前天也这么说
And you said that the day before yesterday.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,093
- Earl?  - 她被困在月亮
- Earl?  - She got stuck between the moon

17
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:39,729
和纽约市的中间了
and New York City.

18
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,943
我知道这有点疯狂 不过这是真事
I know it's crazy, but it's true.

19
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:44,868
对不起我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,770
我找不到我们的猫Nancy了
I couldn't find our cat, Nancy.

21
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,751
我还被困在公交车上 或者是卡在地铁轮子下面了
Also, I was stuck on the bus or under the subway.

22
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:51,775
如果他们说的和我的不一样
Unless they told you something different,

23
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,810
那以他们的为准
then I was doing that.

24
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,313
哦 拜托 那个借口
Oh, come on. That excuse was less satisfying

25
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,449
比"系列"广播剧结束还糟
than the end of Serial.

26
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:01,351
Max 说真的 你到底是怎么对我的?
Max, really, what do you take me for?

27
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,486
嗯 我知道我不能怎么对你
Well, I know where I can't take you.

28
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,235
我不能带你去迪士尼乐园玩
On the big rides at Disneyland.

29
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,325
Nancy还没有回家
Nancy still hasn't come home.

30
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,393
我要疯掉了
I'm freaking out.

31
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,895
我这辈子只爱她一个
She's the only thing I love.

32
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,839
管他呢
Whatever.

33
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,467
我以前也有一只猫 他很酷
I had a cat once. He was cool.

34
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,337
他是黑色的 而且非常性活跃
He was black and very sexually active.

35
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:26,075
哦 等等 我说的这只酷猫就是我
Oh, wait, the cool cat I'm talking about was me.

36
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:29,178
Earl 小心点 你这把年纪了 性爱会要你命
Earl, be careful, at your age, you could die having sex.

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,913
我知道
I know.

38
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,196
那些女人根本就不会知道我是射了还是泄了
Those ladies don't know whether I'm coming or going.

41
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,755
我觉得Nancy可能再也不会回来了
I think Nancy might be gone for good.

42
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,448
我就是无法相信她竟然没带我一起走
I just can't believe she didn't take me with her.

43
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,857
我们都约好了
We had a deal.

44
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,525
Max 就算她不想回来
Max, she'll come back to the apartment,

45
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,160
她也会来的
even if she doesn't want to.

46
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,596
我是说 我就是这样的
I mean, I always do.

47
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,297
我完全不讶异于你的淡定
I am not surprised you're not worried.

48
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,499
你一直都不怎么喜欢Nancy
You never really liked Nancy.

49
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,568
你总是叫她"那只猫"
You call her "that cat."

50
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,672
还说"那只猫"在我枕头上撒尿了
As in, "that cat" peed on my pillow.

51
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:17,476
就在我睡觉的时候 Max
While I was sleeping on it, Max.

52
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:20,980
好吧 怪我咯 我让她喝醉的
Well, blame me. I got her drunk.

53
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:25,017
嘿 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

54
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,989
姑娘们 你们那玩意儿在我包里
Look, girls, I got your pussy in my purse.

55
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,957
她要么指的是猫 要不然你们两个人就得
Either that's a cat, or you two got to keep better track

56
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,761
找找自己的器官了
of your belongings.

57
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:37,863
耶!
Yay!

58
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,999
那只猫回来了
That cat's back.

59
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,568
看到了吧 Max?
See, Max?

60
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,070
我很激动
I am excited.

61
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,306
哦 我想死你了
Oh, I missed you so much.

62
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:49,641
是啊 是啊
Oh, yes, I did.

63
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:52,444
那不是Nancy
That's not Nancy.

64
00:02:52,446 --> 00:02:54,146
这是只公的
That is a boy.

65
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,847
好吧 Max 对不起 我没有第一时间
Well, Max, sorry I don't check out a cat's junk

66
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,950
就去检查那只猫的器官
the second it comes through the door.

67
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,785
是啊 你只看脸
Yeah, you only look at the face.

68
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:03,021
这就是我们俩的差异所在
That's the difference between you and me.

69
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:06,058
你看 这个名牌上写着"小肉桂"
See, look, the name tag says "Cinnamon."

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,261
怪不得那个小女孩一直在哭个不停 还说
No wonder that little girl kept crying and saying,

71
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:12,264
"把肉桂给我 把肉桂给我"
"Give me Cinnamon, Give me Cinnamon."

72
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,000
我看着她的眼睛说
I looked her right in the eye and I said,

73
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:19,271
"人家包里没有携带香料"
"I don't carry spices in my purse."

74
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,540
Max 你完全反应过度了
Max, you are completely overreacting.

75
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,074
- 这只是...  - 哦! 只是什么?
- It's just a...  - Oh! Just a what?

76
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,377
说啊!
Say it!

77
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,045
只是一只猫啊
It's just a cat.

78
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,681
你!
You!

79
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:32,851
嘿 它的名牌还是我花了一块钱给它弄的
Hey, I'm the one who fronted us that dollar to get her name tag.

80
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,486
多亏了我 会有人把她捡起来
Thanks to me, someone's gonna pick her up,

81
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,554
看着她 然后说 "哦 你一定是迷路了
look at it, and say, "Oh, you must be lost,

82
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,523
小...猫"
little... cat."

83
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,859
Nancy! 她叫Nancy!
Nancy! Her name's Nancy!

84
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,160
我知道她叫什么!
I know her name!

85
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:43,995
我只是暂时想不起来了
It got momentarily pushed out of my head

86
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,898
因为我们还有1600件纸杯蛋糕T恤衫
to make room for those 1,600 cupcake T-shirts

87
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,867
卖不掉 而且付不起
we can't unload or pay for.

88
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,502
你以为我没有几乎每天晚上
You think I don't wake up screaming

89
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,438
都为了这些T恤衫尖叫着醒过来吗?
four or five nights a week about those T-shirts?

90
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
但是我知道我们的猫叫什么
But I know our cat's name.

91
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,276
你才不会半夜醒来呢
You don't wake up at night ever.

92
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:01,579
当然不会 我睡得和死婴一样熟 这是我的天赋
No, I sleep like a dead baby, it's my one gift.

93
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,716
哦 电话!
Oh, the phone!

94
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,718
未知号码 可能就是它了!
Unknown number. This could be it!

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,189
我喜欢未知来电 正如不知啥时过期的避孕套
I like my numbers like my condom expiration dates, unknown.

96
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:12,290
你好?
Hello?

97
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,258
- 怎么了?  - 是谁啊 Max?
- Yes?  - Who is it, Max?

98
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,394
她在你手上? 耶!
You have her? Yay!

99
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:17,428
哦 好的 太棒了
Oh, sure, great.

100
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,496
- 谢谢  - 她在他手上?
- Thank you.  - He has her?

101
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,564
Nancy在他那里?
He has Nancy?

102
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,798
算了吧 晚了
Please, too little, too late.

103
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,740
Max 我们欠债一万美元
Max, we're in $10,000 worth of debt

104
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,676
你还花钱去买新的猫砂?
and you spent money on new kitty litter?

105
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:35,613
放松点 我也要在里面撒尿的
Relax, I'm going to pee in it, too.

106
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,415
好吧 我猜它比你在你房间里用的
Well, I guess it beats that Sprite bottle

107
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,283
那个雪碧瓶好多了
you've been using in your bedroom.

108
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,951
从房间走到厕所太远了
It's just such a long walk to the bathroom

109
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,520
我每次走的时候
that every time I have to go,

110
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,922
都感觉像是在为多发性硬化症筹钱
it's like I'm raising money for MS.

111
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,358
哦 好消息
Oh, I have good news.

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,096
我在这个猫砂盒里找到你丢失的胸罩
I found your lost bra in the litter box.

113
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:53,631
别以为我还会再穿了
Don't think I'm not still wearing it.

114
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:54,599
为什么不呢?
I mean, why not?

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,868
我还曾吃过一条被车碾过的热呢
I ate a hot dog that rolled under a car the other day.

116
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,270
我还在这里留下了几块土
I left a couple of big clumps in,

117
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,906
让你穿得更自信一点
just to help you out a little.

118
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,441
哦 好的 Nancy来了
Oh, okay, that's Nancy.

119
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:08,078
这是你们两个重新开始的机会
Here's a chance for a fresh start for you two.

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,180
别提那个胸罩 我不知道它为什么想要
And don't bring up the bra, we don't know why she wanted it,

121
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:12,883
但是它肯定有自己的理由
but I'm sure she had her reasons.

122
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,251
好的 我会好好表现的
Fine, I'll be on my best behavior.

123
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,987
但你得看看它是怎么对我的
But you watch and see how she treats me.

124
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:20,691
这是双向的
It's a two-way street.

125
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:22,126
你好 你们的猫在我手里
Hi, I have your cat.

126
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,728
而且你们的门把手也在我手里
And surprisingly, your doorknob.

127
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,930
哦 那个口香糖已经没用了?
Oh, that gum wore out already?

128
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:29,466
你好啊小兄弟!
Hi, buddy!

129
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:31,268
你好 我叫Caroline 这位是Max
Hi, I'm Caroline. This is Max.

130
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,803
多谢你帮我们找到...
Thank you so much for bringing back...

131
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,938
- Nancy!  - 我知道!
- Nancy!  - I know!

132
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,841
还有别忘了 它都没正眼看过我
And please note, she did not even look at me.

133
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,176
嗨 我是欧文
Hi. I'm Owen.

134
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:43,046
我们"欧"你一份人情啊
Well, we are "Owen" you a big thank-you.

135
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,715
我们最近有点缺钱 请问你愿意
Kind of low on cash, how would you feel

136
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,650
买一千件可爱的"纸杯蛋糕"T恤吗?
about 1,000 cute cupcake tees?

137
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,585
我不需要一千件粉红衣裳
Yeah, I don't need 1,000 pink T-shirts.

138
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:52,089
我不关注体育就已经惹我爸不高兴了
My dad's already mad at me I don't care about sports.

139
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,724
怎么打开这玩意?
How do you get this thing open?

140
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,158
我们一般带Nancy出去
We usually just take Nancy around

141
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,094
是装在旧的吸尘器袋子里
in an old vacuum cleaner bag.

142
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:00,764
同时也用于我的外出包包
Also doubles as my "going out" purse.

143
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,999
不好意思 可以借过吗?
Pardon me, may I get past?

144
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,634
这种礼仪
Oh, manners.

145
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,102
出现在我家门前?
In our doorway?

146
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,305
我都不知所措了
I don't know what to do.

147
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:12,208
接下来会出现没有随意丢弃吸毒针头的门廊吗?
What's next, a front stoop with no discarded heroin needles?

148
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,577
我刚从那走上去的
Yeah, I just came up there.

149
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,446
不是今天
Not today.

150
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:17,605
让我帮你吧
Here, let me help.

151
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:19,817
我就是一个花了两千块买个装猫袋的傻瓜
I mean, I'm the dumb one who paid $2,000 for a cat carrier.

152
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,385
我怀念自己曾经也这么傻
Hmm. I miss being that stupid.

153
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,087
我的猫也打不开这袋子
You know, my cat can't get this open either.

154
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,656
肯定是没有拇指的缘故
It must be the lack of thumbs.

155
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,656
{\an8}猫一般只有四个指头 拇指退化了

156
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,592
大清早的遇到个穿西装的"高富帅"?
Rich, funny, and in a suit at 9:00 A.M.?

157
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,128
我真不知所措了
I really don't know what to do.

158
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,330
我的猫 狄更斯 喜欢你的猫
You know, my cat, Dickens, loves your cat.

159
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:36,733
狄更斯 跟那作家同名?
Oh, Dickens, after the author?

160
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:36,733
{\an8}查尔斯·狄更斯 英国作家 代表作"雾都孤儿"

161
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:36,733
{\an8}狄更斯著作名为"圣诞颂歌"

162
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,736
狄更斯 跟大作家同名 Max
Dickens, after the author, Max.

163
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,771
我知道他是谁
Yeah, I know who that is.

164
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:45,675
写了"木偶圣诞颂歌"的那家伙
The guy who wrote Muppets Christmas Carol.

165
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,877
好了 就知道我打得开
There. I knew I'd get it.

166
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,313
因为我有拇指
'Cause I have thumbs.

167
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,849
它在这呢
Oh, there she is.

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,519
从养猫来看 你是单身?
So I take it by the cat, you're single?

169
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,390
再单不过了
Big time.

170
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,960
那你就和"狄更斯"住一起吗?
So, do you and Dickens live alone?

171
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,262
糟了 她打算要调情
Oh no, she's trying to flirt.

172
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:07,630
我经常因工作出差
I travel a lot for work.

173
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:08,731
我是个风险资本家
I'm a venture capitalist.

174
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,732
所以你也了解情况
So you know how it is.

175
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:10,800
我了解 非常了解
Oh, I do. I absolutely do.

176
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,235
- 我...  - 要炫耀了
- I...  - Here it comes.

177
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:14,370
- 我上了沃顿商学院  - 砰
- Went to Wharton.  - Boom.

178
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,653
要是再找不到它 你知道去哪找
Well, if she gets lost again, you know where to find her.

179
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,174
最近几个月 它每天都在
She's been hanging around outside our window

180
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,575
我们窗外转悠
every day for the last couple of months.

181
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,544
所以我放它进来了 希望没事
So I let her in. I hope that's okay.

182
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,480
哪是没事? 简直棒极了
Is that okay? It's awesome.

183
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,715
我希望你女朋友不会介意
I hope your girlfriend didn't mind.

184
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:27,783
我们刚分手
We just broke up.

185
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:28,884
所以我是单身
So I'm single.

186
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,052
我得离开了
And I better get going.

187
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,054
我10点要开会
I've got a 10:00 meeting.

188
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:32,054
Max 把箱子还他
Max, give the man his case.

189
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,523
他10点要开会
He has a 10:00 meeting.

190
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,225
它不想离开这舒适的地方
She doesn't want to get out of cushy this thing.

191
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,546
我完全理解
I totally get it.

192
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:38,961
我在布鲁克斯东坐按摩椅的时候
I had to be dragged out of that massage chair

193
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,263
得让保安把我拽下来
at Brookstone by mall security.

194
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,032
这是我的名片 如果你想让我过来拿箱子
Well, here's my card, just give me a call

195
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,300
打电话告诉我一声
when you want me to pick up the case.

196
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:47,236
你有名片?
You have a card?

197
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,938
名片 开会 西装 笑话?
A card, a meeting, a suit, a joke?

198
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,275
你是下一个"白马王子"吗?
Are you the next bachelor?

199
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:55,311
谢谢你了欧文·查尔斯·博伊德
Well, thank you, Owen Charles Boyd,

200
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,079
帮我们找到我们心爱的...
for bringing back our beloved...

201
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,647
- 它叫Nancy!  - 我知道它的名字
- Her name's Nancy!  - I know her name.

202
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,617
有必要说那么快吗?
Why do I have to say it so fast?

203
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,087
她开玩笑的 只是没你这么风趣
She's joking, she's just not as funny as you.

204
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,455
很高兴见到你
Well, it was nice to meet you.

205
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,323
拜拜 Nancy
Bye, Nancy.

206
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:09,491
好吧
Okay.

207
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:16,665
我是在调情
Yes, I was flirting.

208
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,267
但是在为咱们的生意着想
But I was doing it for our business.

209
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,503
你真应该为你自己的"生意"着想
You should really be doing it for your business.

210
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:24,339
因为你的"生意"就要"失业"了
'Cause your business is going out of business.

211
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,640
他有名片
He has a card.

212
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,010
而且还不是卖药用大麻的
And it's not for medical marijuana.

213
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,177
他是个风险资本家
He's a venture capitalist.

214
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,278
是个能帮我们
That's the kind of fat cat

215
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,147
站稳脚步的"大款"
that can help us get back on our feet.

216
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,715
说起"傍大款" Nancy看起来
Speaking of fat cats, Nancy's looking like

217
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,918
要给Jenny打个电话
she might need to give Jenny a call.

218
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,286
嘿 姐妹们
Hey, girls.

219
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,456
你们找到Nancy了
Oh, you found Nancy.

220
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,060
我就知道它会怀胎而归
I knew she'd come back pregnant.

221
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:46,695
等等 Sophie 你怎么知道它是怀孕了
Wait, Sophie, how can you tell she's pregnant

222
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,332
而不是像乔纳·希尔那样与发福抗争
and just not fighting the same battle Jonah Hill is fighting?

223
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:54,035
它的毛发增粗了 双眼炯炯有神
Well, her fur is thicker, she's got a little sparkle in her eye,

224
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,871
还有只小猫咪要从它屁屁探出头来
and there's a little kitten head about to pop out of her patoot.

225
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,183
拜托 用力 Nancy
Come on. Push, Nancy.

226
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,918
别这样 我们都知道你干的好事
Come on, we all know what you did.

227
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,126
现在可不是害臊的时候
Now is not the time to be shy.

228
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,724
你知道你在做什么 对吧 Sophie?
You do know what you're doing, right, Sophie?

229
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,126
这不会像上次你跟我们说的
This isn't like the time you told us

230
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,595
你能用蜡烛自制脱毛蜡那样?
you could do your own bikini wax with a candle?

231
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,132
因为我还留着 上次那香草味伤疤呢
'Cause I still have the vanilla-scented scars from that.

232
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,801
别担心
Don't worry.

233
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,503
在我村子里 所有库金斯基女人
In my village, all the Kuchenskis women

234
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,172
都给动物当产婆
acted as animal midwives.

235
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,808
那是钓汉子的最佳方式
It was the best way to meet guys.

236
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,443
快点 姐妹们
Strap in, girls.

237
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,479
啊! 它要生了!
Ah! She's crowning!

238
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,114
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

239
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,483
我还以为Nancy会聪明点
I thought Nancy was smarter than this.

240
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:46,131
结果跟我家其他女人
But it turns out she's just like the rest of the women

241
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,219
一个样
in my family.

242
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,858
被垃圾堆边遇到的陌生人搞大肚子
Screwed by some stranger she met in the dumpster.

243
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,925
好了 要生了
Okay, here we go.

244
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,780
哦 这下戒指丢了
Oh, there goes my ring.

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,734
我... 抱歉 Nancy
I... sorry, Nancy.

246
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,402
哦 要生了!
Oh, here we go!

247
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:09,007
快点 姐妹们 我需要一盆热水和干净的毛巾
Come on, girls, I need some hot water and fresh towels.

248
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,942
这些我们都需要 想要了四年
We do, too. For, like, four years.

249
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,811
呃...
Uh...

250
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,112
用这些T恤怎么样?
how about some of these T-shirts?

251
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,014
有何不可呢?
Oh, sure why not use those?

252
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,415
它们曾是我们的美好未来
They used to be our bright future.

253
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,937
现在就只是擦猫崽子的清洁布
Now just a ShamWow for illegitimate cats.

254
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,957
天啊 那声音一定是
Oh, my God, that must be the sound

255
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,561
猫的子宫在"求饶"
of a surrendering cat uterus.

256
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,238
这也算这么久来 第一次有子宫在那床上
Well, it's the first time a uterus has surrendered

257
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,393
"求饶"了
in that bed in a while.

258
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,003
我居然还不想吐
I don't know why I'm not throwing up.

259
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,907
等等 要吐了
Oh, wait. I'm starting to.

260
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,113
我这辈子都不吃韩国饺子了
Well, I'm off Korean dumplings for life.

261
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,815
这一只... 这一只不肯出来
This one... this one won't come out.

262
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,118
它就像猫界的奎因·拉蒂法
It's like the Queen Latifah of kittens.

263
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,118
{\an8}奎因·拉蒂法曾被爆出柜

264
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,926
Sophie 我收到你的短信说 你跟Nancy在床上
Sophie, I got your text that you were in bed with Nancy.

265
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,294
这个Nancy是谁
Who is this Nancy,

266
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,864
我们啥时又开始玩三人行了?
and when did we go back to doing three-ways?

267
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,300
Nancy是只猫
Nancy's a cat.

268
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,335
唔 那我拒绝
Mm, that's a no.

269
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,038
我还是有底线的
I've got to draw the line somewhere.

270
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,413
我听到消息了
Well, I heard the news.

271
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,951
看来你们俩要在30岁前当外婆了
Looks like you two are grandmothers before you're 30.

272
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:30,821
说不出我有多惊讶
Can't say I'm surprised.

273
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,757
好了 你们问都不用问
Okay, before you even ask,

274
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,259
我不会照付猫产假的工资
I don't pay for cat maternity leave.

275
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,396
这里可不是谷歌
This isn't Google.

276
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,763
这里连"问杰"都不是 Han
This isn't even Ask Jeeves, Han.

277
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,763
{\an8}一种人工操作目录索引的美国著名搜索引擎

278
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,803
我可以帮你们 给猫咪们找个好住处
Well, I can help you get the kittens good homes.

279
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,239
我楼里的居民都非常友好
The people in my building are very nice.

280
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,709
但如果是你忘记回收一个泡苹果酒的瓶子
Except if you don't recycle one bottle of sparkling cider,

281
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,512
那你在电梯里 没人会跟你说话
then nobody talks to you in the elevator.

282
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,714
Han 我们不打算把猫咪送走
Han, we're not giving the kittens away.

283
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,582
Nancy让自己成了一只富裕的猫
Nancy landed herself a rich cat,

284
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,186
我们打算靠巨额的猫咪赡养费维生
we're gonna be living off a hefty kitty support.

285
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,987
只有你们俩会绝望到
Only you two would be desperate enough

286
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,522
想找一只招财猫
to try and find a sugar catty.

287
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,726
欧文给你回电话了吗?
So has Owen called you back yet?

288
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,595
呃 我们在博弈呢
Um, we're trading.

289
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,963
"我们在博弈"?
"We're trading"?

290
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,832
"我们在博弈"是单身白人女孩的说法
"We're trading" is lonely white girl talk

291
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,101
意思是"他没给我回电话"
for "he hasn't called me back."

292
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,336
我真是不敢相信 他是个不负责任的爹
I can't believe this. He's a deadbeat dad.

293
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,205
Max 他只是忙
Max, he's just busy.

294
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,073
我觉得你也许是在投射个人情绪
And I think you might be projecting a little

295
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,274
因为你爸爸的缘故
because of your dad.

296
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,576
而我不是治疗专家
Not that I'm a therapist.

297
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,678
因为我连心理咨询用的长沙发都买不起
I mean, I can't even afford a couch.

298
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,146
我这不叫投射
I'm not projecting.

299
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,849
我最拿手识别不负责任的爸爸了!
I just know a deadbeat dad when I don't see one!

300
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,884
他的名片在哪儿?
Where's his card?

301
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,218
我不记得放在哪儿...
I don't remember where I...

302
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,554
Max 放手! 我来搞定这事
Max, let go! I've got this.

303
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,322
那个人真的能帮到我们的生意
That guy can really help us with our business.

304
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,258
拜托 让我来处理吧
Please, let me handle this.

305
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,225
看 瑞恩·高斯林
Look, Ryan Gosling.

306
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,862
- 我来  - 我来
- I got this.  - I got this.

307
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,330
- 我来  - 我来
- I got this.  - I got this.

308
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,588
继续 姑娘们 我快要高潮了
Keep going, girls, I'm almost there.

309
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:52,736
我来 Max
I got this, Max.

310
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,571
等他来拿猫笼的时候
And when he comes to get the cat carrier,

311
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,605
我会跟他说
I'll talk to him.

312
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,973
你太容易激动了
You're way too emotional.

313
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,535
你连我的围裙都下手了
You just went to third base with my apron.

314
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,716
坐在这台阶上也挺好的
Sitting on this stoop is nice.

315
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,551
我们怎么就一直没来这里坐坐呢?
How come we never sit out here?

316
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,257
这就是原因
There it is.

317
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,819
拜托 只是Rico而已
Oh, please, it's just Rico.

318
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,899
Rico看起来不错 我想他又多了个纹身
Rico looks good. I think he got another tattoo.

319
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,768
听着 欧文到这儿的时候 我们应该还活着
Look, when Owen gets here, should we still be alive,

320
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,170
请让我来进行谈话
please let me do the talking.

321
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,806
猫咪的事先放一边 欧文可以帮我们
Kittens aside, Owen can help us.

322
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,541
一个风险投资人会买多家公司
A venture capitalist buys companies

323
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,842
还能让它们起死回生
and turns them around.

324
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,311
拜托 我看过"风月俏佳人"(电影)
Yeah, I've seen Pretty Woman.

325
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,980
那让我意识到 我的收费还不够高
That's how I realized I wasn't charging enough.

326
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,749
走 Max 他来了
Go, Max, here he comes.

327
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,585
好的 但我会在窗户里面看着
All right, but I'll be watching inside from the window.

328
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,203
这样可能更好 因为我不放心Nancy独自
It's probably better, because I don't trust Nancy alone

329
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:44,954
和其他猫在一起
with those kittens.

330
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:46,589
她有一些严重的产后症状
She's got some serious postpartum.

331
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,591
我离开房间后 她曾用一只颤抖的爪子
When I left the room, she was lighting a Menthol 100

332
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,676
点燃了薄荷油
with a shaky paw.

333
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,763
嗨
Hi.

334
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,965
我们居然能够活着走向彼此
Crazy we live walking distance from each other.

335
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,633
不是的 是"优步"司机
We don't. The Uber driver

336
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,936
不愿意经过拐角处的消防栓
wouldn't go past the fire hydrant on the corner.

337
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,662
挂着只血淋淋的鞋子的那个吗?
The one with the bloody shoe hanging from it?

338
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,972
没错
That's the one.

339
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,976
那什么... 我就是来拿那个箱子的
You know what? I'm just gonna take the cat carrier.

340
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,232
在你走之前...
Before you go...

341
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,882
我们有个小型的纸杯蛋糕公司
we have this small cupcake company

342
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,550
希望成为一家大企业
that's just begging to be an empire,

343
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,586
我想跟你讨教下 生意上的一些事
and I wanted to pick your brain about some business stuff.

344
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,586
{\an8}猫 钱 婊子

345
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,928
好吧 你的狄更斯让我们的猫怀孕了
Okay, so your Dickens got our cat pregnant,

346
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,264
而它刚刚生了五只猫咪
and she just had five kittens.

347
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,999
以它的年龄 我们不用付钱做体外手术
And at her age, it's a miracle we didn't have to pay

348
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,700
真是个奇迹
for in vitro.

349
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,202
你怎么知道是狄更斯的孩子?
How do you know they are Dickens's?

350
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,770
我不是说Nancy很随便
I'm not saying that Nancy's easy,

351
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,071
只是 我看见它进进出出
it's just, I've seen her go in and out

352
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,275
很多窗户
of a lot of windows.

353
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,279
他刚刚掉了一把枪?
Did he just drop a gun?

354
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,515
没事 他还有很多
It's fine. He has more.

355
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,117
好吧 给我助理打电话 你可以跟我讨教
Okay, call my assistant, you can pick my brain.

356
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,820
我只是不想在人行道边聊
I just don't want it to be off the sidewalk.

357
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,389
真的 我得走了 我不能死
Really, I got to go. I can't get killed.

358
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,191
我穿的是新款的绒面革乐福鞋
I'm wearing new suede loafers.

359
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,760
"优步" 助理 绒面革乐福鞋?
Uber, an assistant, and suede loafers?

360
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,062
你是真实的吗?
Are you for real?

361
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,475
希望我没有打扰你
I hope I'm not intruding.

362
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,676
没有 请进
No, come in.

363
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,244
我刚刚在刷我的新乐福鞋
I was just brushing my new loafers.

364
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,480
我买这双鞋 当作是给自己的分手礼物
I bought them as a break-up gift for myself.

365
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:17,788
与我前女友不一样的是 我能填满它
But unlike my ex-girlfriend, these have a sole.

366
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,086
我不想跟你的助理提猫的事
I didn't wanna mention the cat situation to your assistant.

367
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,055
你知道的 接下来整个食堂就会议论
Next thing you know, it's all over the lunch room:

368
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:26,913
欧文·查尔斯·博伊德的猫很滥交
Owen Charles Boyd's cat is a raw-dogger.

369
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:28,794
被我的生意伙伴给踩了一脚
My business partner stepped on them.

370
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,962
说那是个意外
Said it was an accident.

371
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,129
感觉不像
Didn't feel like one.

372
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,998
一只鞋有可能 但两只?
One shoe yes, but both?

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,133
非常不可能
Highly unlikely.

374
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,470
欧文 有时候在生活中 不仅仅是一只
Owen, sometimes in life, it's not just an innocent cat

375
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,771
无辜的猫被操蛋了
that gets screwed.

376
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,008
一个姑娘也会被操蛋
A girl can get screwed as well.

377
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,218
哦 你好 有什么事吗?
Oh, hey, hi. What's happening?

378
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,481
比如 被一个错误的商业决策给毁了
As in, screwed by one bad business decision.

379
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,616
我的合作伙伴Max 还有我
My partner, Max, and I recently invested

380
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,720
最近把我们的所有积蓄投资到... 这里 看看
all our savings in... well, here, take a look.

381
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,155
哦 我的咖啡!
Oh, my coffee!

382
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,323
- 哦  - 我的乐福鞋!
- Oh.  - My loafer!

383
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,926
我的咖啡洒在我的乐福鞋上了!
My coffee's on my loafer!

384
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,961
让我来
Here, let me.

385
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,129
不 轻轻擦 不能猛擦绒面革
No, you dab. You don't wipe suede.

386
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,297
轻轻擦
You dab.

387
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,132
轻轻擦 轻轻擦 抱歉
Dab. Dab. I'm sorry.

388
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,266
我从前懂的
I used to know that.

389
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,568
这是富人必修课
That's Rich 101.

390
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,936
我去弄点水
Let me just go find some water

391
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,273
然后轻轻擦它 不会猛擦它
and I'll dab, not wipe, this out.

392
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,808
我们还没聊完 我会回去的
We're not done yet. I'm going back in.

393
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,068
进行得非常顺利
It's going really well though.

394
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,078
哪儿有水?
Where's water?

395
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,014
你知道怎么撤回邮件吗?
Do you know how to unsend an email?

396
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,116
要是我知道 我那有钱的前男友就不会发现
If I did, my rich ex-boyfriend would've never found out

397
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,252
我嫌弃他口齿不清
what I thought of his lisp

398
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,288
我现在也就会住在法阔蓝部了
and I'd be living in the "thouth of Franth" right now.

399
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,825
他在哪?
Where is he?

400
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,561
他得见见这些可爱的小混蛋
He needs to see these adorable bastards.

401
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,129
Max 你怎么知道我在这儿?
Max, how did you find me here?

402
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,098
我跟你说 我正在进行一场思维漫步
I told you I was going on a "think walk."

403
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,166
我跟踪了你
I followed you.

404
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,043
我以前都没发现你喜欢在商店玻璃前
I never noticed how much you check yourself out

405
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,537
照镜子 你这是毛病
in store windows. You have a problem.

406
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,573
你们知道怎么把 "自私透顶的蠢猪"
Do either of you know a way to turn the phrase,

407
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,758
变成赞美之词么
"self-absorbed, ridiculous pig" into a compliment?

408
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,913
如果我会的话 我就能上"飞黄腾达"这节目了
If I did, I'd still be on The Apprentice.

409
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,148
欧文马上就能看到这封邮件了
Owen's going to see that email

410
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,483
我要被炒了
and I'm going to get fired.

411
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,838
我必须得学着注意细节了
I have to start paying attention to details.

412
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,354
我要进去了
I'm just gonna go back in.

413
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,690
什么? 我才不在乎呢
What? I don't care.

414
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,757
要是不让我进去 你也休想进去
Not without me you're not.

415
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,619
Max 求你了 让我来处理吧
Max, please, let me handle this.

416
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,627
我求你了
I'm begging you.

417
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,730
我们马上就能成功了 看 我已经拿到他的鞋了
We're getting close, look, I'm holding his shoe.

418
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,298
如果他不拿出点行动来
If he doesn't step up here,

419
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,766
这些小猫就会觉得被忽视了
these kittens will feel neglected,

420
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,268
然后它们迟早会成为服务员
and it is only a matter of time

421
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,136
或者比这更糟
till they are waitressing or worse.

422
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,771
Max 你错了
Max, you're wrong.

423
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,507
没有什么比服务员更糟的了
There's nothing worse than waitressing.

424
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,909
Max 冷静!
Max, stop!

425
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:25,876
你会把一切都搞砸的
You'll ruin everything.

426
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,578
我能搞定这事 拯救咱们
I can fix this and us.

427
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,880
我们没救了
We are beyond help.

428
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,448
是要帮这些小猫
It's all about these kittens.

429
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,816
- 现在 闪开 我来处理  - 不 我来
- Now move, I got this. - No, I got this.

430
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,951
- 我来  - 我来
- I got this. - I got this.

431
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,020
我...
I...

432
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,588
噢 天呐
Oh, my God.

433
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,670
发生了什么?
What the hell is happening?

434
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,628
没错 我带着一篮子的小猫来到你的办公室
That's right. I came to your office with a basket of cats.

435
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,397
Max 不好意思
Max, I'm so sorry.

436
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,932
嗯哼 他才是那个应该觉得抱歉的家伙
Yeah, well, he's the one who should be sorry.

437
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,604
我要你看着这些小公猫
I want you to look these kittens in the whiskers

438
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,840
告诉他们狄更斯不是他们的父亲
and tell them that Dickens is not their father.

439
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,598
你凭什么觉得他们是我家的 凭什么?
What makes you think they're mine. Why?

440
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,044
就因为他们长得
Because they look just like Dickens

441
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,847
跟狄更斯小时候一模一样吗
when he was a tiny baby kitten.

442
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,882
噢 这只更可爱了
Oh, and this one's even cuter.

443
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,084
还有那一只
And that one.

444
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,785
我会照顾他们的
I'll take them all.

445
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,574
除了那一只 看起来有点傻
But not that one. Seems a little off.

446
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:12,789
不像别的那么机灵
Not quite as alert as the others.

447
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,026
噢 她配不上你吗?
Oh, she's not good enough for you?

448
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,928
- Max 你在感情投射了  - 我没有
- Max. Projecting.  - I'm not projecting.

449
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,588
他说她配不上他
He said she's not good enough for him.

450
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:20,664
什么?
What?

451
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,934
就因为她是意外怀孕所生 而且数学不好吗?
Just because she was unplanned and not good at math?

452
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,403
或者是因为胸部发育的太早?
Developed boobs way too early?

453
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,771
好吧 我是在感情投射
Okay, fine. I'm projecting.

454
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,039
发生了什么?
What is going on?

455
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,407
Caroline 我们不是准备上床吗?
Caroline, are we gonna hook up or what?

456
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,143
这或许是 最奇怪的前戏了
This is, like the weirdest foreplay ever.

457
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,645
上床? 你凭什么认为我想跟你上床?
Hook up? What would make you think I want to hook up?

458
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,148
噢 因为我的商业调情?
Oh, because I business flirted?

459
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,716
这是沃顿必修课
That's Wharton 101.

460
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,584
这可不仅仅是商业调情
It was more than business flirting.

461
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,786
你哀求着要来我的办公室
You begged to come to my office,

462
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,188
穿着透视装出现在我面前
show up wearing a see-through shirt.

463
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,323
这是因为我没别的衣服可穿了
That was not by choice.

464
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,191
便宜货都这样
It is cheaply made.

465
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,926
我过来是想跟你谈生意的
I came here to talk to you about our business,

466
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,762
让你能给我们投资 哪怕就一点点也是好的...
and possibly get you to invest in a small, but spirited...

467
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,565
投资? 这可是世界金融中心
Invest? This is the financial capital of the world.

468
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,634
是 没错
Yes, it is.

469
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,436
为什么我要去投资一个快倒闭的小蛋糕店?
Why would I invest in a desperate little cupcake shop?

470
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:04,574
你!
You!

471
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,809
够了!
That's it!

472
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,210
不许你收养小猫了
No cats for you.

473
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,578
你知道吗?
You know what?

474
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,847
你真是一个自私透顶的蠢猪
You are a self-absorbed, ridiculous pig.

475
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,914
你随便说
Says you.

476
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,982
你的秘书也这么认为
And your assistant.

477
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,310
查收邮件吧
Check your email.

478
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,254
我刚把邮件撤回了
I was able to unsend it.

479
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,590
耶!
Yay!

480
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,894
好吧 或许你还会想重新点击发送
Yeah, might want to re-ignite that LinkedIn profile.

481
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,863
你应该常常一个人在家吧 需要一只小猫吗?
You're gonna be home a lot more, you want a cat?

482
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,271
Han 谢谢你照顾这些小猫
Thanks for taking the kittens, Han.

483
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:36,639
我觉得你对小动物都很有同情心
I feel like you have an understanding

484
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,942
因为你自己就是
of small creatures, being one yourself.

485
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,912
放心吧 我公寓里都是女同
Have no fear, my building is loaded with lesbians.

486
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,280
她们收养小猫的速度
They take home rescue cats

487
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:47,183
远远快于收养同性恋
faster than they take home other lesbians.

488
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,285
好的 现在让我们讨论下我的收养条款吧
Okay, let's discuss my terms.

489
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,786
与我那些非人类的孩子相比
Unlike all my non-animal children,

490
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:53,189
我希望它们能得到悉心的照顾
I want to know they're taken care of.

491
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,891
你们难道不了解女同吗?
What part of lesbian don't you understand?

492
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:59,128
夜晚来临的时候 她们甚至会用法兰绒把小猫包好的
They'll be swaddled in a flannel shirt by nightfall.

493
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,198
好的 这只名为瘾君子
Okay, now this one, I call Junkie.

494
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,567
因为它痴迷于猫薄荷
'Cause he's got a serious Catnip problem.

495
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,036
噢 所以你在一周之内就培养了一名吸毒爱好者
Oh, so you raised a drug addict within a week.

496
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,571
不错嘛
Sounds about right.

497
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,506
这两只应该在一起
These two should try and stay together.

498
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,275
我们叫他们 权力的游戏第一部
We call them Game of Thrones One

499
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,810
和权力的游戏第二部
and Game of Thrones Two.

500
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:17,819
因为他们是兄妹又是恋人
'Cause they're siblings and lovers.

501
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,481
这只是公的
This one's the boy.

502
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:23,025
看看他 跟他学学怎么性交
Watch him and learn what humping looks like.

503
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,754
这只超级温柔
This one's pretty bland.

504
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,623
她总是趴着 也不叫
She lays around, doesn't meow much,

505
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,392
当它叫唤起来像是电话响个不停
and when she does, she's kind of phoning it in.

506
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,361
我们管她叫艾米·亚当斯
We call her Amy Adams.

507
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,543
没错
Yep.

508
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:36,238
最后一只要格外注意了
This last one gets special attention.

509
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,540
虽然她最小了 但是很有潜力
She's the smallest, but she's got potential.

510
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,243
我是说 看看这些乳头
I mean, look at those nipples.

511
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:44,646
现在我满脑子都是乳头了
And now the nipples are all I see.

512
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:45,781
祝你好运
Have a nice life.

513
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:47,316
我会上图片分享网看你们的
I'll find you on Instagram.

514
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:48,317
还有看看"暴躁猫"
Check out Grumpy Cat.

515
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,318
跟他学学
Do what he does.

516
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,719
那么 再见了 小猫咪们
Well, bye, kitties.

517
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:54,089
记着 脱衣舞不是舞蹈
And remember, stripping isn't dancing.

518
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:58,126
现在我满脑子都是它们穿着胸贴的样子了
And now all I can see is them wearing pasties.

519
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:59,761
你知道吗 Max?
You know what, Max?

520
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:01,496
我们不需要那个有钱人来帮我们
We don't need that rich guy to fix our business.

521
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:03,465
我们可以靠自己
We can do it ourselves.

522
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:05,133
我在骗谁呢? 我们的生意还不如
Who am I kidding? Our business is in worse shape

523
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,936
高尔夫球场手推车的老头呢
than two retired guys in a golf cart.

524
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,504
你知道咱们得先修理什么吗?
Well, you know what we'd better fix?

525
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:11,006
就是Nancy
Nancy.

526
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,608
有钱人说的没错 她就是个荡妇
'Cause he was right, she's a slut.

527
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,812
有人发现她正在小巷里和一只虎斑猫玩69式
Someone just found her 69-ing a tabby in the alley.
