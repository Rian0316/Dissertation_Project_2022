1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:04,300
Kids, I told you stories
about all the big holidays--

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:05,649
Christmas...

3
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:07,367
Halloween...

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,548
Thanksgiving...

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,279
but one holiday was
always my favorite--

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,043
Super Bowl Sunday.

7
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,864
And there was one
Super Bowl back in 2007

8
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:19,524
that I will never forget.

9
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,087
Marshall, you're
on beer detail.

10
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:22,980
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.

11
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:25,098
Uh, Robin,
you're on chips and pretzels,

12
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,773
and Barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do

13
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:29,614
so you can just focus on
controlling your gambling problem.

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,093
"Problem."

15
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,362
Oh, poor Superman,
he should really do something

16
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,432
about his flying problem.

17
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:38,263
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.

18
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:42,343
And I will be going to Quinn's to
pick up the world's greatest food,

19
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,611
the Super Bowl
Hot Wings Platter.

20
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,490
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.

21
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,340
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.

22
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:51,291
I'm crazy like that.

23
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,981
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.

24
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:55,163
What's tomorrow night?

25
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,683
Oh, God, you didn't hear?

26
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:59,572
Mark died.

27
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,511
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

28
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,272
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
and I know

29
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:06,720
it would have meant a
lot to Mark if you came.

30
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:09,631
You guys were his
favorite customers.

31
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:13,160
- Stay strong.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,410
Who was Mark?

33
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,762
- No idea.
- Not a clue.

34
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:23,732
Well, I guess we
should go, right?

35
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:28,020
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the Super Bowl.

36
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,902
Okay, I feel terrible,
but the truth is we didn't know Mike.

37
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:32,770
- Mark.
- Mark,

38
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,822
and as long as we send flowers,

39
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,992
I can't think of any
reason we'd have to go.

40
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,253
Get out of here!

41
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:41,063
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!

42
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,751
This soulless bastard just told me
he can't come to Mark's funeral

43
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,971
because he wants to
watch the Super Bowl.

44
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:50,872
Could you believe that?

45
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,281
You guys are coming, right?

46
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:56,451
Yes... Wouldn't
miss for the world.

47
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,213
Okay, here's the plan :

48
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:13,382
record the game,
go to the funeral,

49
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:15,140
- pay our respects to Matt...
- Mark.

50
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:18,511
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.

51
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,730
Okay, that's great,
but just to make sure it records,

52
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,510
maybe we should bow our
heads and say a quiet prayer

53
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,161
to the TiVo gods.

54
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,492
Almighty TiVo,

55
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,591
we thank you for all the
gifts you have given us:

56
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,910
the power to freeze live
TV to go take a leak

57
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,792
is nothing short of Godlike.

58
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:40,073
Let's not forget fast-forwarding
through commercials.

59
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:43,031
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,

60
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,940
O magic box,

61
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:48,842
but if you malfunction
and miss the Super Bowl,

62
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,372
we will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.

63
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,640
- Amen.
- Amen.

64
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:54,972
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.

65
00:02:54,987 --> 00:02:56,161
Yeah, they're the best part.

66
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,051
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?

67
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:01,513
Who wants to watch a monkey in
a coconut bra order a pizza?

68
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,962
Oh, my God.
This monkey was so cute.

69
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:08,032
Seriously, that's the last
time I'm gonna call you today.

70
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,202
Okay.

71
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,873
Good-bye.

72
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,121
You  didn't hang up either!

73
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:14,981
I know! You hang up!

74
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,581
You hang up!

75
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,151
My bookie. Great guy.

76
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:23,703
So let me get this straight. A funeral
is the one time you don't suit up?

77
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,653
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?

78
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:26,931
Virtually.

79
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,013
Suits are full of joy.

80
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:32,390
They're the sartorial
equivalent of a baby's smile.

81
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,491
"Sartorial"?

82
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,573
"Of or pertaining to
tailors or their trade."

83
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,452
Suits are for the living.

84
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,120
That's why when it's
my time to R.I.P.

85
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,331
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it--

86
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,751
buck naked. Yeah.

87
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,181
It's gonna be awesome.

88
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:48,323
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.

89
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,032
What up?!

90
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,683
- Such a waste.
- I know.

91
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,242
He was so young.

92
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,663
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.

93
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:30,732
It must be so frightened.

94
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,022
This is going faster
than I thought.

95
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:35,013
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,

96
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,992
we'll be watching
the game by 8:00.

97
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,600
And even though we
didn't see any whales,

98
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:43,041
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.

99
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:46,213
Okay, I'm getting
us another round.

100
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,042
And when I come back,

101
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:51,030
everyone else is telling
their favorite Mark story.

102
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,101
Dibs on the one Carl just told.

103
00:04:56,685 --> 00:05:00,290
Okay, I have to be at work
exactly one Super Bowl from now.

104
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:02,281
Oh, let's face it,
we're not going to get to watch it.

105
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,961
We should just find
out the score.

106
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,420
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.

107
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:08,102
No, no, no, we can't!
We have to watch the game together.

108
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:09,361
It's tradition.

109
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,312
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.

110
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:15,103
Second down, everyone drink.

111
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,683
Ted, it's not a drinking game

112
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,130
if you drink anytime
anything happens.

113
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:22,381
Are these chicken
wings or angel wings?

114
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,321
God, I love these things.

115
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,473
I love you guys.

116
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:30,090
This is so great, all of us
watching the Super Bowl together.

117
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:32,150
This is special.

118
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,952
We need to do this every year--
promise me!

119
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,440
Calm down, buddy.

120
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,072
Oh, commercials!

121
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,793
Everyone drink!

122
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:47,593
God, this is such a great tradition,
all of us watching the game together.

123
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,340
How did this start?

124
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:52,222
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks
that Casey misses this field goal.

125
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,701
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.

126
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:57,392
Make it like a dollar or something,
you know. Who cares? No big deal.

127
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,103
Fine.

128
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,772
See, there you go, he made it. 
You win.

129
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,763
Wait. This is mine,
just like that?

130
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:08,072
God, that feels good.

131
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,811
No, that feels really... good.

132
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,231
What else can we bet on?

133
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,322
Nothing, it's the
halftime show.

134
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:17,051
Oh, so lame.

135
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,770
Nobody even pays attention.

136
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,612
I mean, Janet Jackson,
who cares?

137
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,892
God, how cool is Robin?

138
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:30,640
I  can't believe you invited this girl
we've only known for a few months

139
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,252
to our sacred day.

140
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,952
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.

141
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,492
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the Seahawks

142
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,380
plus six points for 500 bucks.

143
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,450
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

144
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,368
$50?! What fun is $50?!

145
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,583
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, Marshall!

146
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:45,904
Okay, $50.

147
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,180
Hey, I'll take that action.

148
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,540
Seahawks, but make it four
points and make it a grand.

149
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,401
Hey, these wings,
are they chicken wings or angel wings?

150
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,681
Oh, commercials!

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,790
Monkey with a coconut
bra. Hilarious.

152
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,593
Look, we always watch
the Super Bowl together.

153
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,323
So we make a pact to
watch it tomorrow at 6:00

154
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,992
and go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.

155
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:07,690
That's impossible.

156
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,823
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

157
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:12,480
That means no TV, no Internet,

158
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,240
no newspapers, nothing.

159
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:15,932
Media blackout.

160
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,663
But our tradition lives on.

161
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,332
Who's in?

162
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,450
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

163
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,303
- I'm in.
- What the hell, I'm in.

164
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:26,390
- High five!
- Dude, we're at a wake.

165
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,322
Sorry. Solemn low five.

166
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,001
As the day began, none of us had
any idea how hard it would be

167
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:38,461
to go nine hours without hearing
the outcome of the Super Bowl.

168
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,901
I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination

169
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:43,022
by the outside world.

170
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:50,441
Hey, take this key
and swallow it.

171
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,530
What? No.

172
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:54,333
Come on, Ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.

173
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,110
Lots more, no.

174
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,761
I'm not messing
around, Theodore.

175
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,300
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.

176
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,463
If I don't handcuff
myself to this radiator,

177
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,750
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.

178
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:05,860
Fine.

179
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,690
But only because you didn't
think through a bathroom plan

180
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,820
and I think that's funny.

181
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:21,192
The media blackout was
particularly hard on Robin

182
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,763
because, well,
she was the media.

183
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,053
But unfortunately,
the City won't be fixing

184
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,541
the unusually large
pothole any time soon,

185
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,312
so buckle up if
you're on the BQE.

186
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,260
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

187
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,821
Like  morning commutes
needed to get any harder.

188
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,472
You're right, Kevin.

189
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, Robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in with Sid

190
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,202
- for a sports update.
- No!

191
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,793
- What?
- No.

192
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,640
But it's, uh, time for Sports.

193
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:52,520
No, it's not.
It's time for Weather.

194
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:54,810
We, we just did Weather.

195
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,172
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

196
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,412
it may have changed.

197
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,792
What's it doing out there, Lou?

198
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:06,541
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.

199
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,703
Back to you, Robin.

200
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,271
Okay, now it's time for Sports.

201
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:16,161
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd

202
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:18,212
in the Metro News
1 Gridlock Chopper.

203
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,231
Robin, it's time for Sports!

204
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,840
Over to you, Sid. 

205
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:28,650
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.

206
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:31,302
Let's talk about
the Super Bowl.

207
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:33,752
Weeks earlier,
Marshall had promised Lily

208
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,732
he'd come into her kindergarten
class for show-and-tell day.

209
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,213
And he's a little
bit double-jointed...

210
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:42,873
And his favorite animal
is the Loch Ness monster.

211
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,611
Lily, how many times...?

212
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,382
Nessie is a gentle creature.

213
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:49,322
We're  trying to stay away
from terms like "Monster."

214
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,353
Well, I think we can all agree,
he is much more interesting

215
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:55,641
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.

216
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:58,241
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, Sally.

217
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:01,492
Okay, well,
that's all the time we have.

218
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,492
Arts and crafts, everybody.

219
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,933
Hey. I'm Doug.

220
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:11,101
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.

221
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,571
Are you going to be staying
here for the rest of day?

222
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:17,481
Yeah, I'm actually
trying to hide out

223
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,811
'cause I don't want to know
who won the Super Bowl.

224
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,763
I know who won.

225
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:24,452
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,

226
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,730
so  if you could just
keep that to yourself.

227
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:30,662
How badly do you
not want to know?

228
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:32,741
Excuse me?

229
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,732
Ten bucks.

230
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,323
Are you serious?

231
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,583
Just went up to eight.

232
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,821
Unlock me, Ted.

233
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,142
I've never gone this long
without calling my bookie.

234
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:44,631
He worries.

235
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,252
Not until game time.

236
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,430
Where are you going?

237
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,793
Pick up the hot wings.

238
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,422
What? How the hell are
you planning on getting

239
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,722
in and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?

240
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:56,940
There's TVs everywhere.

241
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,481
Ah, don't worry.

242
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,993
I got it all planned out.

243
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:01,492
First of all:

244
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,743
I placed duct tape on
a pair of sunglasses

245
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:06,162
so I can only see out
of two tiny holes.

246
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:09,961
Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.

247
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,801
Top it all off:
high-tech noise-reducing headphones

248
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,823
I bought when Marshall and
Lily first got back together

249
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,363
and were doing it a lot.

250
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,171
I call it the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

251
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,602
Hello! Uh,
my name is Ted Mosby.

252
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm here to pick
up my hot wings.

253
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:49,782
In my hand, you'll find the
exact total for the wings

254
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,732
plus a generous tip.

255
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,340
Please take the cash.

256
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,441
Put the wings in my hand
and I'll be on my way.

257
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,973
Thank you!

258
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:08,333
And that closes the book on
one heck of a Super Bowl.

259
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,361
Back to you, Kevin and Robin.

260
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,441
We'll be right back.

261
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,273
And we're clear.

262
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,662
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,293
Um, Robin, is it just me,

264
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,772
or were you doing
something different there?

265
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,720
I haven't watched the game yet.

266
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,250
I'm begging you,
for the rest of the newscast

267
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:30,042
there can't be any references
to who won the Super Bowl.

268
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,752
I mean,
change the teleprompter.

269
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,851
No team names,
nothing specific.

270
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,372
That is crazy. I can't do that.

271
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:40,361
My friend Mark passed
away this week.

272
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,883
Okay, sweety okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

273
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,820
Back in five... four...

274
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,793
- three...
- It's just so hard.

275
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:17,272
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!

276
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:20,542
You said the Sensory
Deprivator 5000 was stupid.

277
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,142
But it totally worked!

278
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:24,881
I couldn't see or hear
anything happening around me.

279
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,230
Right?! Right?!

280
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,160
No...!

281
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:33,203
And if that weren't bad enough,

282
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:35,723
I was about to have a
horrible realization.

283
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,621
Where's the dipping sauce?

284
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,421
The team that won, want to know
what their name rhymes with?

285
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,390
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop

286
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,362
if I ate all those crayons.

287
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,381
Why are you doing this?

288
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,601
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.

289
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:56,802
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin,
she's mine.

290
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:07,533
Okay, now who did this?

291
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,251
I did.


292
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,083
Does that mean Marshall
gets a time-out?

293
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:19,132
Well, Marshall's
a grownup, so...

294
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:22,221
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.

295
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,881
Sorry.

296
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,760
And after the Super Bowl,

297
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:36,633
the mayor of the losing
team's city had to pay up,

298
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,560
sending the mayor of
the winning team's city

299
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:43,033
15 pounds of a delicacy his
or her city is famous for.

300
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,600
Better fire up whatever type of grill,
steamer or fryer

301
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:51,160
one might use to cook that delicacy,
Winning Team's Mayor.

302
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,183
Hey.

303
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:56,371
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.

304
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:57,642
Yes, you are.

305
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,540
You'll do whatever I say.

306
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,350
- Hold your breath.
- I'm not holding my breath.

307
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,212
The winning team was the...

308
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:07,281
Now here's how this
is going to work:

309
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,461
you're going to take me to
three R-rated movies a week...

310
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,473
And then Uncle
Marshall got an idea.

311
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,650
It was not one he was
proud of in retrospect,

312
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,793
but desperate times...

313
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:23,061
Oh, no.

314
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,353
Somebody wet their pants.

315
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:26,853
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

316
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,133
Who's everyone gonna believe?

317
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,251
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at Columbia

318
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,773
and you're just a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:

319
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:36,743
You want to be able to quietly sneak
off to the restroom and dry off

320
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,500
or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?

321
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:42,160
- Hey, everyone...
- Okay, okay.

322
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,910
You win.

323
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,712
I want my money back.

324
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,770
And your pudding snack pack.

325
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,331
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?

326
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:59,940
Sorry. I missed the game.

327
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,593
You missed...?!
How could he miss...?

328
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,380
Excuse me!
Who won the Super Bowl?!

329
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,422
I... don't really
follow sports.

330
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,971
Oh, my...!

331
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:10,210
Emmitt Smith!

332
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,892
Oh, thank God.

333
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,491
Yeah, I get that a lot.

334
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,023
You got to tell me,
who won the Super Bowl?

335
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:18,251
The game was last night?

336
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,222
You know, once you win two
or three of those things,

337
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:23,872
it's kind of like, eh.

338
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,812
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a
football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.

339
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:30,092
What could possibly be more
important than football?!

340
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:34,312
Dance, my friend. Dance.

341
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,643
No...!

342
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,243
Hello! It's me again.

343
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:03,192
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

344
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:06,473
Yeah, you forgot to give
me the dipping sauce!

345
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,433
Ah. Yes.

346
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:13,803
This is the one.

347
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:17,603
It was 4:00, and so far,
all of us had done the impossible.

348
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,483
But then,
almost simultaneously,

349
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,222
things started to go wrong.

350
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,380
And let's end the
day on a happy note.

351
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,341
There is a new arrival
at the Bronx Zoo.

352
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:29,041
Trish Sanchez has the story.

353
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,632
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude, look out.

354
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,203
And in honor of
yesterday's big win...

355
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,682
- Hey, buddy, look out.
- Dude, watch out!

356
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,152
...the zoo decided to
name the baby panda

357
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,281
after Super Bowl champions...

358
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,712
No...!

359
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,892
No...!

360
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,310
No...!

361
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:24,181
Yes...!

362
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,410
Awesome. Just in
time for kick-off.

363
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,200
None of you guys found
out the score, right?

364
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,012
- Mission accomplished.
- Didn't find out.

365
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:37,430
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded

366
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:40,973
through the four hours of pre-game 
coverage. So we are ready.

367
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,823
Barney, I can't
even look at you.

368
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,541
I don't want any
sign of who won.

369
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:48,252
Don't worry,
I'm not going to give anything away.

370
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,043
Feel free to start without me.

371
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:55,013
Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

372
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:57,041
So much money!
You screwed it up, Barney!

373
00:18:57,055 --> 00:19:00,350
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

374
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,933
Okay,  let's watch the game.

375
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,790
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.

376
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,142
Now you've ruined the
game for everyone.

377
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,771
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.

378
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:11,922
Way to blow it.

379
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,590
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.

380
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,702
There's no point in
even watching the game.

381
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,880
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.

382
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,613
Wings are still good.

383
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,400
Beer still works.

384
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,602
Ah, what the hell.

385
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,701
Let's watch Barney
lose some money.

386
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:39,302
Hey, so check this out:

387
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:41,933
I got extorted by a
five-year-old today.

388
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,213
I almost got fired today.

389
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:45,670
I met Emmitt Smith today.

390
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:46,832
Ooh, you go first.

391
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,211
I tried out the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

392
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,992
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.

393
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:53,531
Well, I was frantically
running down the street

394
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:55,392
trying to find out the
score to the game...

395
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,901
And here's the funny part,

396
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,330
as unforgettable as
that Super Bowl was,

397
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:03,310
here it is 23 years later and
I don't remember who won...

398
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,742
Hell, I don't even
remember who played.

399
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,321
What I do remember is
that we drank beer,

400
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,353
we ate wings and we watched
the Super Bowl together.

401
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,490
Because sometimes, even if you know
how something's going to end,

402
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:19,083
that doesn't mean you
can't enjoy the ride.

403
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,802
We even raised a toast
to good old Mike.

404
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:23,811
I mean Mark. Matt.

405
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,920
Crap! Why do I keep doing that?

406
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:32,990
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.

407
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:36,502
Total penalty yardage,
number of replay-challenges,

408
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:37,573
coin toss...

409
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:40,012
What are the odds of
losing the coin toss?

410
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:41,882
50-50, give or take.

411
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:46,253
Interceptions, field-goals,
total sacks,

412
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:49,453
whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...

413
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:57,202
