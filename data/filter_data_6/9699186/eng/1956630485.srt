00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,760
You have a sex problem,
but you still get pocket money?

177
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,360
- [mumbles]
- Well, we're not a charity, okay?

178
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
So come back with the cash,
and I'll book you in.

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
[Otis] New client?

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,000
No. [clears throat]
Got a couple tomorrow though.

181
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Look, um...

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,360
I think my mum being on campus
might be bad for business.

183
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
- I think you're being paranoid.
- You don't know my mum, all right?

184
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
She says she's just doing research.

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Before you know it,
she's in everyone's head.

186
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it.

187
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
[Aimee] Happy birthday!

188
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,800
I baked a cake!

189
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,400
- Why didn't you say it was your birthday?
- Because I hate birthdays.

190
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,160
No one hates birthdays, Maeve.

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Why celebrate the day I got pushed out
of some random vagina against my will?

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,760
[chuckles] Think of all those gems
of nihilistic wisdom

193
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
the world would be missing
if you hadn't been born.

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Happy birthday, oh, joyous one.

195
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
Just tell him you like him, already.

196
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,760
So, what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

197
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
Nothing.

198
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,920
What happened to this cake, exactly?

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Oh, it didn't look so bad before,

200
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
but then I was on the bus,
and a guy wanked on my leg,

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,840
and I got a bit of a shock,
and I smushed the cake.

202
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
What?

203
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,240
Do you think it'll stain?

204
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
I love these jeans.

205
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
You... you have to report it.

206
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
It's fine, they were only cheap.

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
No, you've been assaulted.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,800
I think he was just lonely,
or not right in the head or something,

209
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,920
which is weird
'cause he was quite handsome.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Aimes, this is serious.

211
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,520
It's silly. I'm fine, honestly.

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay. I know what I want to do
for my birthday.

213
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,160
I want us to go to the police.

214
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,760
Where did you take Ola on your first date?

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Um... we didn't really go on any dates.

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
[clears throat]

217
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
Just started hanging out.

218
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
What do you mean?

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
You know, like playing video games,

220
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,080
talking, eating cereal.

221
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,640
Otis, that's what you and me do.

222
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes, except I don't kiss you.

223
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,840
I think French people
like to go on proper dates.

224
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,720
- Where should I take him? [sighs]
- Okay, just don't stress.

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,680
Just as long as you guys are together,
I don't think it matters.

226
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
I don't even know why I'm asking you.

227
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,360
You've never even been on a date.

228
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,640
[phone playing game sounds]

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
[deep male voice on phone] <i>Juicy.</i>

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,680
How are your chats
with the students going?

231
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,000
Seems a little quiet.

232
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,560
It's... still early.

233
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,920
Hmm.

234
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
I wanted to reiterate
that you have not been employed

235
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
at Moordale as a counselor.

236
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,240
Yes.

237
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,040
You've made that more than clear.

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm only speaking to the students
about the curriculum.

239
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,880
If they ever come to speak to you,
that is.

240
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,200
Welcome!

241
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
Hi, I'm here to talk about SRE stuff.

242
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,200
Yes, of course you are.
Please, have a seat,

243
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,240
and... could you possibly just
close the door on your way out, Mr. Groff?

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
Thank you!

245
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,640
Right.

246
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,960
What's your name?

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Malek Amir.

248
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,920
Malek Amir. Nice to meet you, Malek.

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
I don't have to pay for this, do I?

250
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,640
No.

251
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Right, so...

252
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,240
what do you feel the SRE curriculum
is currently missing?

253
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,480
Okay, so a friend of mine

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,560
is dating a girl
who keeps putting a pillow over his face

255
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
when they have sex.

256
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,520
Would the curriculum cover that, maybe?

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Interesting.

258
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,520
Adding fetish to the curriculum
could be a... a real asset.

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Fetish?

260
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,600
Yes, there are hundreds
of sexual fetishes, actually,

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,200
and, lo and behold,
they often start during puberty.

262
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,840
Well, you know,
covering a person's face during sex

263
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,040
could be anything
from a desire to engage in, well,

264
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,880
breath play, or even encasement fantasy,

265
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,120
or sometimes, although very rare,
ghost fetish.

266
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,840
- Ghost fetish?
- Yeah.

267
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,840
When one covers another's face
because they secretly have a desire

268
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
to engage in sexual activity
with a spirit or a ghost.

269
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,400
So my girlfriend's insane.

270
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,360
I thought you said
it was your friend's girlfriend?

271
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
I've gotta go.

272
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,400
Fascinating.

273
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
Wow. Who knew?

274
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,480
Do you wanna fuck a ghost?

275
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,680
What?

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,560
Well, whatever
your face-covering fetish is,

277
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,880
you need to sort it out,
because it's weird and it's scary

278
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,920
and it's just making me feel
just very unsafe.

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,920
[sighs]

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
[phone ringing]

281
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
[woman] I'll get a form
for you to fill in.

282
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,360
See, she's got a proper problem.

283
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920
You've got a proper problem.

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,600
Pothole on the high street.
Bloody council.

285
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Come on, let's go.

286
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
It's basically like he sneezed on me
or something.

287
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,280
He came on you, Aimee. Yeah?

288
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Yeah.

289
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Cum is kind of like a penis
having a sneeze.

290
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,360
Ugh! That means
when you swallow someone's cum,

291
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,520
it's like eating their snot.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
[woman] Take a seat,
we'll be with you in a bit.

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,880
- Hi there, how can I help you?
- Hi.

294
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,520
[clears throat]

295
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,440
[stammers] This is my friend Aimee.
She got sexually assaulted on the bus.

296
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,560
I got jizz on my jeans.

297
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,720
I mean, we're probably wasting your time.

298
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,240
You're not wasting anyone's time,
all right?

299
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you need to call somebody?

300
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,720
Shit, do I need a lawyer?
Am I gonna get arrested?

301
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,240
No, sorry. I just meant, like,
your mum or someone.

302
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh, God, no.
She'll just make it into a drama.

303
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
Right. Take a seat,
fill out one of these forms,

304
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,320
and an officer will be with you
in a minute.

305
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,760
- Thank you.
- Uh, you forgot your cake.

306
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
Oh.

307
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,520
- Is it someone's birthday?
- Yeah, mine.

308
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
Oh, <i>feliz navidad.</i>

309
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,680
That means "merry Christmas."

310
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,440
Hmm.

312
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
[mumbles indistinctly]

313
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,240
Men are so weird.

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
I think he's cute.

315
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,200
Why do people always think
old men are cute?

316
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,560
How do you know he hasn't jizzed
on someone on a bus before?

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
I meant the lizard.

318
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,319
What's going on?

319
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,839
[indistinct chatter]

320
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,360
[Colin]
So... this year's school production

321
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

322
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,200
is not only gonna be a play, but also...

323
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,680
drum roll, please...

324
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
[imitating a drum roll]

325
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,760
[grunts] ...a musical, yo!

326
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Huh?

327
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,480
Who's pumped? Who's pumped?
I'm pumped. Yeah?

328
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,480
It will be written and assistant-directed
by Swing Band's very own Lily Iglehart,

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,840
and auditions will be held
bright and early tomorrow morning.

330
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,800
Now, I've got a really special feeling
about this one, guys.

331
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,280
It's a chance for everyone
to really find their place... and shine.

332
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey, you forgot your audition speech.

333
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,520
What is this I see?

334
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
Jackson Marchetti auditioning
for the lowly school play?

335
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,000
Will wonders never cease?

336
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't really understand Shakespeare,
sir, it doesn't make sense.

337
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,760
Well, that's the beauty
of will.i.am-bic pentameter.

338
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Okay, thanks.

339
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,880
[Maureen] Hello.

340
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,320
Uh, not history.

341
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh, no, I'm Michael's wife, Maureen.

342
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,480
Oh. Sorry. Jean. Sex ed-ish.

343
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Hello.

344
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,600
It's Mr. Groff's dinner.
I drop it in on Wednesdays.

345
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,400
He works late, marking.

346
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,920
- How are you getting along?
- Good.

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Good, yeah.
Think I'm getting the hang of it.

348
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Yes.

349
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,320
Michael used to come home
on the verge of tears most nights

350
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,840
during his first term as headmaster.

351
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh, don't tell him I said that.

352
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,120
Anyway, glad you're toughing it out.

353
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,520
Thank you.

354
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,560
I... was wondering whether...

355
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,560
Yes, what is it?

356
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
[nervously chuckles]

357
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,920
[stammers] I was wondering whether...

358
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,800
you could tell me where you got
that shade of lipstick from?

359
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,040
It's fabulous. [chuckles]

360
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
Well, I don't remember.

361
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,160
But next time you're here,

362
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
why don't you pop in
and I'll let you know?

363
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,680
Great.

364
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,960
- Well, I better get Mr. Grumpy his food.
- Yes.

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,040
It's nice to meet you, Jean.

366
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,880
Nice to meet you too, Maureen.

367
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
Do you wanna hang at mine
before your date?

368
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
I can't. I haven't decided
what I'm gonna wear. What should I wear?

369
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
- Wow. How the tables have turned.
- Oh, Otis,

370
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
I don't have time for this conversation.
I have to go home

371
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
and try on everything I own.

372
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Well, maybe just lose the scarf.

373
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,680
Maybe lose your virginity?

374
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,080
[gasps] Olivia, Jesus!

375
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
You could have killed yourself.

376
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Thanks to your mum,
my boyfriend thinks I wanna kill him.

377
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
Why?

378
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Because I sometimes do this thing, okay,
where I cover his face with a pillow

379
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,760
just when I cum
and now your mum thinks I have a fetish.

380
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,240
- Which you don't?
- I have an ugly cum face, okay?

381
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,520
I've seen it in the mirror before.
It's bad.

382
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,640
I look like a python swallowing an egg,
and Malek always looks perfect.

383
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,080
Well...

384
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,680
that's normal to feel observed
and vulnerable when you're having sex.

385
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
And he probably feels
just as silly sometimes, too.

386
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,440
We... we might think we look stupid
or unappealing,

387
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,840
but sex isn't always perfect
and it should be about feeling good,

388
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,760
not looking pretty.

389
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
It's a privilege
to see your partner like that.

390
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,280
So maybe you and your boyfriend
need to work on your trust,

391
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,600
so you can show him yourself fully,
like, all the bits.

392
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,800
Even the bits you think might be ugly,

393
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,600
'cause I bet he doesn't think they are
at all.

394
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,680
And...

395
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
there's something I think might help.

396
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,800
I got a B plus in algebra.

397
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,920
You know that's not very impressive?

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
- [blows raspberry]
- So, do you want to do your English

399
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,560
or maths homework today?

400
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,280
Well...

401
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,000
actually, I was thinking
of auditioning for the school play,

402
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,200
but I don't understand Shakespeare,
and I wondered if you could help me.

403
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,120
- Not my remit. Maths or English.
- Come on.

404
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Look, I'd never have got
a B plus in algebra if it wasn't for you.

405
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,000
And I'm sure you've got
some Shakespeare tricks up your sleeve?

406
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,480
Please.

407
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,480
You're not cute.

408
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,720
[Jackson chuckles]

409
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
Why do you wanna audition anyway?

410
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
Well, I'm taking your advice
and getting a backup plan.

411
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,840
When I played Joseph
in my primary school Nativity,

412
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
people said I was very believable.

413
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
- Of course you played Joseph.
- Come on.

414
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,360
Please. You're a tutoring genius.

415
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,080
Fine.

416
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,560
- But this is a one-time thing.
- Yeah.

417
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
Read me the speech.

418
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,480
- Now?
- Yeah.

419
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,200
All right.

420
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,000
All right.

421
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,920
"It is my lady, oh, it is my love,

422
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
- "oh, that she knew she wor..."
- Why are you reading it

423
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,000
- like it's a shopping list?
- Because it makes no sense.

424
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
It's poetry.

425
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,560
Once you've got the rhythm,
the words take on meaning.

426
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,920
So, each line has ten syllables,
made up of five heartbeats.

427
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Ba-boom, ba-boom,
ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

428
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,760
You try.

429
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
[clears throat]

430
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,680
"Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon,

431
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,000
who is already sick and pale with grief."

432
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,240
So you've got the rhythm and the words.

433
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,800
Now you need the emotion.

434
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,000
This speech is about love.

435
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,400
So, try thinking of someone
who makes you feel a lot when you say it.

436
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,280
Ooh. [laughs]

437
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
Hope I get my jeans back.

438
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Do you really want them back, though?

439
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,560
Yeah, they're the perfect bootleg, Maeve.
You don't find that very often.

440
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,720
It's true.

441
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,480
- Do you think they're watching us?
- Yeah, probably.

442
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,360
[chuckles, farts]

443
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,880
- Oh!
- No.

444
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,320
- Aimee.
- I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.

445
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
[knock at door]

446
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,680
[door opens]

447
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,800
That wasn't me.

448
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
Sorry, I fart when I'm scared.

449
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Okay.

450
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,680
All right...

451
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,840
Thanks for the jeans, Aimee.

452
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
Where were we?

453
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
So...

454
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,360
fair hair, clean-shaven,
five feet eight or nine...

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,760
and a blue jacket.

456
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,120
It was kind of aqua.

457
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,280
And was he already on the bus?

458
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,600
Yeah.

459
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,800
I think so.

460
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,640
He might have got on at the second stop.

461
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
Well, it's really important to know
what stop he got on at

462
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
so we can get
as clear a picture as possible.

463
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,240
So you said you remember smiling at him.

464
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,920
Was that after the first stop
or the second?

465
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,560
Sorry,
what's that got to do with anything?

466
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,200
Are you saying
she shouldn't have smiled at him?

467
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
Charges like this
are really hard to convict,

468
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,680
and if we do actually catch the guy,
the questions are gonna get harder.

469
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,080
Can I have my jeans back, please?

470
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,240
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry to make a fuss.

471
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,160
Aimes, um... [clears throat]

472
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,080
[whispers] ...what if he does this
to someone else? I know you can do this.

473
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,400
Please?

474
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,000
- You're doing brilliantly, Aimee.
- [Maeve] Yeah.

475
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,280
Just take your time.

476
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,320
Try to remember.

477
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
He was already on the bus.

478
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
How was your day at school, Ola?

479
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
Good.

480
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
How was your day at school, Mum?

481
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Having fun hanging out with all my peers?

482
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,280
It was very good, thank you.

483
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,960
[sniffs]

484
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,760
[groans, chewing loudly]

485
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
- Dad.
- Hmm?

486
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,520
- Stop.
- Oh, sorry.

487
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,160
I eat like a pig sometimes.
[clears throat]

488
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,920
I've been alone for too many years.

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
Hmm. [sniffs]

490
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,800
My mum's been single a long time too.
She doesn't eat like that.

491
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,080
[Jean] Otis!

492
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,280
[Jakob] Um...

493
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,640
this is delicious.

494
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Mmm.

495
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,600
You don't eat this?

496
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
Otis doesn't like fat.

497
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Oh, really?

498
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,720
- Ah, um...
- Can I have it, then?

499
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,640
Do you have any more? No.

500
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
Thank you.

501
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,200
Fat is the best bits.

502
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Oh.

503
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,240
It's bad for your heart.

504
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,440
Really? It's not a proven fact.

505
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,720
Well, I disagree.

506
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
[smacking lips] I'm okay with that.

507
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
Right.

508
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,560
Why don't we all take a deep breath

509
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,280
and tell each other
exactly how we're feeling?

510
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,080
Let's start by saying
the first words that come into our minds.

511
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Okay, I'll start. Annoyed.

512
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Immature.

513
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Selfish.

514
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,080
Uncomfortable.

515
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,000
Invasion.

516
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
Overly sensitive.

517
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,720
[Otis] That's two words, Mum.

518
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,000
Monopoly.

519
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,000
Why don't we all play Monopoly instead?

520
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,360
You guys ready? Give you a lift.

521
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
Is the lizard going to jail?

522
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760

and then we'll drop these two on the way?

Oh, don't worry. No need for a payment.

Sure, I mean,
I'm not gonna have to go anywhere,

Why can't you be happy for me?

558
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,480
No, you're pretending to be happy, Mum.

559
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
You're not the relationship type.

Stop kidding yourself.

561

as you thought.

I'm just not used to some of the flavors.

Mmm, it's okay, it's my first cake.

I don't have a boyfriend.

She is in love with a boy though.

585
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,240
She's just too afraid to tell him
how she feels,

586
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,720
which is stupid
because he clearly loves her back.

587
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,440
Shut up, Aimee, you don't know that.

588
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,320
I think you should tell him how you feel.
What have you got to lose?

Uh, um, sorry. I actually ordered
the special, the fishy something?

You know, something with,
um, Ryan Gosling.
