00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,740
我想在六周之后安排预审听证会
I'd like to schedule a pre-trial hearing in six weeks.

169
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,190
并且拒绝被告保释
And I'm going to deny bond.

170
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,170
法官大人
Your Honor --

171
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,410
这是我的决定
That's my decision.

172
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,730
谢谢你抽空与我们见面
Thank you for making time for us on such short notice.

173
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,750
我们想当面告诉你
We wanted to tell you face-to-face

174
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,420
律所里的所有人
how much everyone in the firm

175
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,580
都为昨天发生的事感到遗憾
regrets what happened yesterday.

176
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,580
图克姆卡里的情况完全失控
The situation in Tucumcari spiraled out of control,

177
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,510
对此我们负全责
and we take full responsibility.

178
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,710
凯文  你选了我当你的律师
Kevin, you chose me as your attorney.

179
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,630
那是我职业生涯中最美好的一天
And that was the best day of my professional life.

180
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,100
昨天是我职业生涯中最可怕的一天
Yesterday was the worst day of my professional life.

181
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,470
我无法表达让你失望的歉意
I can't tell you how much I regret that I let you down.

182
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,580
但我想让你知道  如果你选择
But I want you to know that, if you choose

183
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,740
继续与我和律所进行合作
to move forward with me and with us,

184
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,800
这种事不会再发生第二次
nothing like that will ever happen again.

185
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,150
事情出了差错  这不可否认
No one's denying ‭that things went off course,

186
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,200
但我们应该记得  过去的一年半里
but let's keep in mind that over the last 18 months,

187
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,300
我们开设了二十四家新分行
we've opened 24 new branches.

188
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,470
在图克姆卡里之前
And, until Tucamcari,

189
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,610
法律方面的工作一直完美无缺
the legal work has been...flawless.

190
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,540
金  你掉链子了  这没得说
Kim, you dropped the ball. That's for sure.

191
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,940
凭借你的才智
And, uh with all your smarts,

192
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,020
还有一整个办公室的高学历同事
whole office full of associates and fancy degrees...

193
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,910
你居然被一个...
you get rolled over by...

194
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,480
你知道怎么回事
Well, you know what happened.

195
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,420
我本来对你的期望更高
I expected more.

196
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,960
感谢你们的到来
Thanks for coming in.

197
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,500
谢谢你  凯文
Thank you, Kevin.

198
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,280
-佩奇  -谢谢
- Paige. - ‭Thank you.

199
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,870
金  还有一件事
Kim, one more thing.

200
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,940
这个家伙  叫麦吉尔还是古德曼  随便吧
This fella -- McGill or Goodman, whatever.

201
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,320
你可以找个更好的
You could do a whole lot better.

202
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,760
我觉得五五开吧  但至少我们试了
I'll say 50/50, but we gave it a shot.

203
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,150
里奇  我们不能就这样走了
Rich, we can't leave it like this.

204
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,060
他会纠结一段时间  到时候再看结果吧
Oh, he'll stew for a bit, and then we'll see.

205
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,870
如果他继续和我们合作了  那怎么办
And if he does stick with us, then what?

206
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,660
我们要一直如履薄冰下去吗
We walk on eggshells forever?

207
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,370
我们还有别的选择吗
What's our alternative?

208
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,860
我们反驳了  是吗
We countered with seven, right?

209
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,670
没错  但是在经过调查后
Yes, but after the survey --

210
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,880
抱歉打扰了
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

211
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,140
介意我们再占用几分钟时间吗
Do you mind if we take just another minute of your time?

212
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,540
可以
I guess.

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,060
凯文  无论我们接下来的关系看起来如何
Kevin, no matter what our relationship looks like moving forward,

214
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,440
我们欠你一个事实
we owe you the truth.

215
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,480
事实就是  你无视了我们的建议
And the truth is, you ignored our advice.

216
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,370
这成我的错了
Oh, so this is my fault.

217
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,000
我们说过  梅萨维德
We said Mesa Verde

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,270
应该重新考虑客服中心的地址
should reconsider the site for the call center.

219
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,670
你拒绝了
You declined.

220
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,710
我们建议你保留成交的土地  作为投资
We advised you to keep the purchased lot as an investment.

221
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,280
你也拒绝了
You declined.

222
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,760
我们还建议你离开会议
And we advised you to leave that meeting

223
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,050
因为对方在谈判过程中明显要进行敲诈
when it became apparent that the other side was negotiating in bad faith.

224
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,020
你还是拒绝了
You declined.

225
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,720
我们在每一步都给了你最好的指导
At every point, we gave you the best guidance we could,

226
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,860
但每次你都选择自行其是
and at every point, you chose to go your own way.

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,180
我们是你的律师
We are your attorneys,

228
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,420
给你建议是我们的职责
and it is our job to advise you.

229
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,040
做决定的人永远是你
The decisions will always be yours,

230
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,790
但如果你继续无视我们的建议
but...if you continue to ignore us...

231
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,920
那我们就不该合作
then this is the wrong relationship.

232
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,410
还有  凯文  我必须告诉你
And, Kevin, I have to tell you,

233
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,190
以后不管谁做你的律师
whoever represents you in the future...

234
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,310
我希望你多听取他们的意见
I hope you're gonna listen to them a little bit better.

235
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,630
说完了吗
That it?

236
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,980
那好吧
Alright, then.

237
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,750
周四见
See you on Thursday.

238
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,100
好
Okay.

239
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,810
我们...就不打搅了
Well, uh...I guess we'll get out of your hair.

240
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,640
周四
Thursday.

241
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,390
JMM
JMM.

242
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,010
那是什么
What's that?

243
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,160
是我的座右铭
Oh, that's my motto.

244
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,610
是吗
Yeah?

245
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,770
"公正最重要"
"Justice Matters Most."

246
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,150
好  说重点
Okay, brass tacks.

247
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,500
"德古兹曼"这身份有多可信
Um, how solid is this "De Guzman" thing?

248
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,700
如果他们发现你的真实身份
Because if they find out you're not who they think you are,

249
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,890
-那可能会有点...  -这不会是问题
- that could be a little -- - It's not gonna be a problem.

250
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,590
很好
Great!

251
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,870
首先
Um, first up,

252
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,440
我们得把谋杀指控减轻为过失杀人
we got to get the murder rap down to manslaughter.

253
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,360
我认为地检准备和你谈认罪协议
Now, I think that the DA is primed to cut a deal.

254
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,760
让他们主动提出  争取主动...
So I say make 'em come to us, power move --

255
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,340
-不  -不
- No. - ‭No?

256
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,830
不  不谈协议
Nope. No deal.

257
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,120
要是闹到庭审的话...
Here's the thing about going to trial --

258
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,330
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

259
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,070
不上庭  不谈协议
No trial. No deal.

260
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,850
好吧  没问题  只是...
Okay, yeah. Sure. Just...

261
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,370
你有什么高见
What did you have in mind?

262
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
你先把我保出去
You're gonna get me out on bail.

263
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,880
保释
Bail?

264
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,340
这...
That's...

265
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,340
那边的规矩...
Well, the thing there --

266
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,600
我不知道边界以南的办事规矩
I mean, I don't know how things work south of the border,

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
但这里  在这种情况下
but here, ‭under these circumstances,

268
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,450
希望渺茫
uh, well, that's a long shot.

269
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,180
你想和贩毒集团交朋友吗
Quieres ser amigo de el cartel?

270
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,050
不好意思  我不懂...
I'm sorry. I-I don't, uh...

271
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,320
你想和贩毒集团交朋友吗
You wanna be a friend of the cartel?

272
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,790
你该换新座右铭了
Time to get yourself a new motto.

273
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,510
挣钱最重要
Just. Make. Money.

274
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,470
"但'朝生暮死'是什么意思"
"'But what does that mean, "Ephemeral"?'

275
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,780
小王子追问道
repeated the little prince,

276
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,300
他这个人一有问题
who never in his life let go of a question

277
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,750
就要刨根问底
once he had asked it.

278
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,520
"意思是
'It means,

279
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,310
'有很快会消失的危险'"
"Which is in danger of speedy disappearance."'

280
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,990
"我的花有很快会消失的危险吗"
'Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?'

281
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,260
"毫无疑问"
'It certainly is.'"

282
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,360
好了  孩子  剩下的以后再读
Okay, kid, ‭we'll finish the rest later.

283
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,660
现在该说晚安了
Now, good night.

284
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,310
不要嘛  爷爷
Not yet, Pop-pop.

285
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,400
再读两页
Just two more pages.

286
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,740
就两页  然后睡觉  好吗
Two more pages, and that's it, alright?

287
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,550
你躺下吧
Now lie down.

288
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,750
"我的花朝生暮死"
"'My flower is ephemeral,'

289
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,880
小王子喃喃自语道
the little prince said to himself,

290
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,690
"而且她只有四根刺
'and she only has four thorns

291
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,970
来抵御这个世界的侵害"
to defend herself against the world."

292
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,660
她睡着了
She's out.

293
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,960
应该是《小王子》的功劳
Think "The Little Prince" did the trick.

294
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,560
我觉得是你跟她玩捉迷藏把她累坏了
I think you wore her out with all that hide-and-seek.

295
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,140
我说不好
I don't know.

296
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,860
也许是她把我累坏了
I think maybe she wore me out.

297
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,620
我有一个女同事
This girl at work --

298
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,530
她不知道怎么哄儿子睡觉
she can't get her son to sleep.

299
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,880
那孩子两岁了
The kid's 2 years old,

300
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,790
半夜还在大闹天宫
and he's still tearing around the house at midnight.

301
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,850
马蒂就是那样
Matty was like that.

302
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,280
真的吗
Really?

303
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,730
嗯  真的
Yeah, really.

304
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,450
一直不消停
Never wanted to conk out.

305
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,070
闹死人
‭Too busy.

306
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,420
他真可爱
He was such a cutie.

307
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,900
我很喜欢他坐在圣诞老人腿上的照片
I love those pictures of him sitting on Santa's lap.

308
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,110
那小脸
Ahh, that face.

309
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,270
大哭不止  每年如此
Cried his eyes out. Every year.

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,250
但每到第二年  他都想再试一试
And every year, he'd want to try it again.

311
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,980
我现在好些了
I'm better now.

312
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,830
发生什么了
What changed?

313
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,370
我决定面对现实
Decided to play the cards I was dealt.

314
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,110
他就说周四例会上见
Just said he'll see us at the regular Thursday meeting.

315
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,500
你对当权者说了真话
You spoke truth to power.

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,210
那就看看他会不会听了
We'll see if he sticks to it.

317
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,720
你今天怎么样
How'd your day go?

318
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,500
我结婚了
I got married.

319
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,890
过来
Here.

320
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,170
怎么了
What?

321
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,620
我想隐瞒你一件事
I'm having the urge not to tell you something.

322
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,160
不是什么大事
It's nothing.

323
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,800
我晚点告诉你  好吗
I'll -- ‭I'll tell you later, okay?

324
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,430
吉米  等等  等等
Jimmy, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

325
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,330
什么事
What?

326
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,510
我有一个新客户
I have a -- a new client.

327
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,150
他有些关系
He's, um, connected.

328
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,430
我是说  他是贩毒集团的
I mean, he's a cartel guy.

329
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,290
墨西哥那边的
From Mexico.

330
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,190
级别挺高
Pretty high up.

331
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,860
不管怎样  他因谋杀被捕
Anyway, he's in for murder,

332
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,850
想获得保释
and he wants bail, which --

333
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,230
这根本不可能
That's impossible.

334
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,600
这家伙永远也不可能重见天日了
I mean...no way in hell this dude is ever seeing sunshine.

335
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,240
但如果我可以  想办法...
But if I could, you know, somehow find a way...

336
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,960
他说了  我可以成为贩毒品集团的朋友
um...he said, uh, I'd be a friend of the cartel.

337
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,010
"贩毒集团的朋友"
"Friend of the cartel"?

338
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,160
你知道这意味着什么
You know what that means.

339
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,780
意味着钱
Means money.

340
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,790
像蒙大拿州农场主一样有钱
Ranch in Montana kind of money,

341
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,290
可以买得起自己的私人飞机
like, uh, private jet kind of money

342
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,120
出席记者招待会
press conferences,

343
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,910
上电视  等等
TV news, the works.

344
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,290
但是...
But...

345
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,550
你想成为贩毒集团的朋友吗
do you want to be a friend of the cartel?

346
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,420
不  不
No. No.

347
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,700
当然不了  我...
Absolutely not. I...

348
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,410
不管怎样  八字还没一撇
Anyway, it's a moot point

349
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,540
因为这个人潜逃风险极高  所以...
'cause the guy's the definition of a flight risk, so...

350
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,940
我准备好好为他辩护  就是做做样子
Look, I'm gonna put up a fight, right, just for show.

351
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,820
不可能有法官会批准他的保释
There's no judge on earth that's gonna grant him bail.

352
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,680
只是  我想对你隐瞒这件事
I just -- ‭I didn't want to tell you,

353
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,700
所以我觉得我应该告诉你
so I thought I should tell you.

354
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,980
你知道吗
You know what?

355
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,570
什么
What?

356
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,590
很高兴你跟我说了
I'm glad you did.

357
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,850
好了  回你的牢房去
Alright, back in your cell!

358
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,040
不  不  我没事  我没事
No, no. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

359
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,280
第六街是怎么回事
So, what's happening with sixth street?

360
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,240
赚了多少
And the take?

361
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,720
好
Okay.

362
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,150
你准备怎么办
So, what're you gonna do about it?

363
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,460
准备把疯子小八弄进来吗
You gonna send in Ocho Loco?

364
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,360
那更好
Oh. Even better. Nice.

365
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,660
听着
Listen.

366
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,810
我有件事要交给你去办
I got something for you to do.

367
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,320
不谈谈我爸的事  我什么都不会告诉你的
I'm not telling you shit until we talk about my dad.

368
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,030
你要告诉我什么以及你什么时候说
What you tell me and when you say it

369
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,970
这由不得你
is not up to you.

370
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,810
你说当拉罗出局后
Listen, you said ‭when Lalo's out of the picture,

371
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,290
我们就能谈谈我父亲  对吧
we'll talk about my father, right?

372
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,040
他现在出局了
Well, ‭he's out of the picture.

373
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,500
你说吧
Say your piece.

374
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,230
我不干了
I'm done.

375
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,660
我想退出
I want out.

376
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,260
你想让我帮你跟弗林划清界限
And you want me to square it with Fring.

377
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,530
不只是弗林  还有贩毒集团
Fring's not all of it. It's the cartel.

378
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,180
我一消失
I disappear,

379
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,640
他们就会去对付我父亲
they're gonna go after my father.

380
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,970
他得跟我一起走
He's gotta come with me.

381
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,250
但无论我跟他说什么
But no matter what I say,

382
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,060
他都叫我去找警察
with him it's the cops or nothing.

383
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,720
但警察解决不了这事
The cops won't solve this.

384
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,750
你有办法吗
You got a way?

385
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,480
你还有什么没告诉我
What are you holding out?

386
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,850
罗拉从里面给我打电话了
Lalo called me from inside.

387
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,790
他让我重新掌权
He put me back in charge.

388
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,790
然后呢
And...?

389
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,710
然后
And...

390
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,230
他希望我烧毁一家洛博罗炸鸡
he wants me to burn down a Pollos Hermanos.

391
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,360
那他就没有出局  对吧
Then he's not out of the picture, is he?

392
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,990
"牛油果风暴"的活动促销
The "Avocado mania" promotion,

393
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,170
在我们挑选的几个分店试行后

397

我们一眼就知道这是个机遇
We know a good thing when we see it,

398
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,280
所以我们决定于第二季度全面推出"牛油果风暴"
so we are planning to fully roll out "Avocado mania" in Q2.

见到你我真高兴  朋友
It's good to see you, my friend.

你气色不错
Oh, you look well.

447
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,010
我不太舒服
Well, I don't feel well.

448
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,020
但是你来了我可能会好受一些
Maybe things will improve now that you're here.

449
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,400
莉迪亚告诉我塞拉曼加进监狱了
Lydia tells me Salamanca is in jail.

450
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,330
是不是你就能继续施工了
This means you can continue construction?

451
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,200
爱德华多·塞拉曼加因谋杀被捕了
E-Eduardo Salamanca has been arrested for murder.

452
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:24,010
然而  他在狱中也...不安分
However, even from jail he creates...issues.

453
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,210
怎么个不安分法儿
What kind of issues?

454
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,070
他让手下去烧我的一间餐馆
He ordered his men to burn down one of my restaurants.

455
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,350
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

456
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,680
他在坐牢还能那么干
He's in jail. He can still do that?

457
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,410
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

458
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,450
我知道这不是我的专长领域
I know it's not exactly my area of expertise,

459
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,520
但监狱里不是总出人命吗
but don't people get killed in prison all the time?

460
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,850
"被捅死"  "被攮死"  一切死法皆有可能
I mean, "Shanked" and "Shivved" and whatnot?

461
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,350
塞拉曼加在国境这边出了事
Anything happens to Salamanca on this side of the border,

462
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,300
贩毒集团就会怪到我头上
the cartel will assume that it was my doing.

463
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,060
那意味着战争
It would mean war.

464
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,460
让我们措手不及的战争
War for which we are unprepared.

465
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,730
天啊
My God.

466
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,970
这噩梦还没完没了了
This nightmare never ends.

467
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,100
-他担心钱  -还"担心"
- He's concerned about the money. - ‭"Concerned"?!

468
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,640
四百八十万欧
4,800,000 Euros.

469
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,120
我没被抓简直是奇迹
It's a miracle I haven't been caught.

470
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,460
去年  审计员就差这么一点
Last year ‭the auditors came this close.

You got me in my underwear, so enjoy the show.

541
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,750
你是爱德华多·塞拉曼加的代理律师
You're representing Eduardo Salamanca,

542
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,750
也就是豪尔赫·德古兹曼
AKA Jorge De Guzman.

我需要你给他保释出来
Well, I need you to get him out on bail.

545

等等  你怎么扯上拉罗·塞拉曼加的
Wait. What do you have to do with Lalo Salamanca?

546
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,180
我只是代表利益相关方
I represent someone who has an interest.

什么样的人
Someone like who?

不能让你委托人知道的人
Someone your client can never know about.

549
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,710
但是  我不接受神秘人士发号施令
Yeah, look, ‭I don't take marching orders from the man behind the curtain.

551
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,960
你知道塞拉曼加都干过什么吧
You know what Salamanca did, right?

552

你们真的认为我会对你们的
Did you actually think I wasn't gonna hear

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,160
"私家侦探"毫不知情
about this "Private eye" of yours?

The mysterious "third party" who's coaching your key witness.

566
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,230
好吧
Alright, good.

567

行吧
You know what?

我迫不及待想看他再整你们一次
I can't wait to see him rip you both a new one.

肯定是他的家人

古德曼先生
Mr. Goodman?

588
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,290
没错  法官阁下
That's right, Your Honor.

589
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,450
干扰证人
Witness tampering.

590
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,860
我有理由认为
I have reason to believe

591
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,020
公诉方的关键证人
that the prosecution's key witness

592
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,420
受到了一名私家侦探的引导
was coached ‭by a private investigator

593
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,960
他受雇妨碍司法公正
who was hired to pervert justice.

594
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,500
公诉人有回应吗
Does the prosecution have a response?

595
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,400
很不幸  法官阁下
Unfortunately, Your Honor,

596
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,590
似乎有我们不知道的一位不明人士
it seems a person unknown to my team

597
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,740
可能与我们的证人有过接触
may have interacted with our witness,

598
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,000
让她打给罗伯茨警探
causing her to call Detective Roberts

599
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,560
并在最初审讯两个月后修改证词
and amend her statement two months after the initial interview.

600
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,690
我们最近才发现此事
This only recently came to our attention,

601
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,430
正在积极调查中
and we are vigorously investigating.

602
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,140
但愿如此
I would hope so.

603
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,100
话虽如此  法官阁下
Having said that, Your Honor,

604
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,740
这位证人只是本公诉案中很小的一环
this witness is one small element of the state's case.

605
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,390
鉴于犯罪情节极其暴力
In light of the extraordinary violence of the crime

606
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,140
以及德古兹曼先生为外籍人士
and the fact that Mr. De Guzman is a foreign national

607
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,880
与本地社区毫无关系
with no ties to the community,

608
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,090
我们请求法院将其视为潜逃风险
we ask that the court recognize him as a flight risk

609
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,140
同时也对新墨西哥州民众造成威胁
and as a danger to the citizens of New Mexico.

610
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,520
古德曼先生
Mr. Goodman?

611
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,940
恕我直言  法官阁下
Uh, all due respect, Your Honor,

612
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,670
这位证人不仅仅是本公诉案中
but the witness is not just one "Small element"

613
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,840
"很小的一环"
of the state's case.

614
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,580
她还是唯一能将德古兹曼先生
She's the only witness

615
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,360
与凶杀现场联系起来的证人
tying Mr. De Guzman to the murder scene,

616
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,570
而她受到了他人操控
and she's been manipulated.

617
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,320
此外  关于德古兹曼先生
Furthermore, the claim that Mr. De Guzman

618
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,950
与本地社区毫无关联的说法  显然是无稽之谈
has no ties to the community -- that's just patently false.

619
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,210
德古兹曼先生与阿尔布开克市有着深刻羁绊
Mr. De Guzman has deep ties to the city of Albuquerque.

620
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,140
我向您介绍  他的家人
I'd like you to meet... his family.

621
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,890
那是他的未婚妻
Uh, that's his fiancée

622
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,970
他的挚爱  贝丝·麦金农
and the love of his life, Beth McKinnon,

623
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,760
他的继子女  克里斯托弗和艾拉

625
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,320
法官阁下

00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,150
这些孩子只有我委托人这一个父亲

他们都依靠他生活

您怎么忍心

拆散这个美好的家庭呢

抱歉

631
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,510
德古兹曼先生涉案的证词
The testimony, um, implicating Mr. De Guzman in this crime --

632
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,940
是捏造的

633
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,250
您已经关押他三天时间
You've already held him for three days.

634
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,560
考虑到现有情况
Given the circumstances,

635
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,680
应该让德古兹曼先生获得保释
Mr. De Guzman should be granted bond.

636
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,180
法官阁下  请求私下磋商
Your Honor, a sidebar?

637
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,120
公诉方就没做好调查吗
Didn't the state do any investigating at all?

638
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,420
我们调查了  法官阁下
We did, Your Honor.

639
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,960
法官阁下  根据现有信息...

00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,170
我接受辩方观点  允许保释

643
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,140
但考虑到指控的严重性

644
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,930
我决定将保释金额设为七百万美元

我还在考虑
I'm still giving it some thought.

662
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,070
"还在考虑"
"Giving it some thought"?

663
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,610

你有点奇怪啊  霍华德

你知道什么才叫"奇怪"吗
You want to know what's "Weird"?

673
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,670
你给一个人提供了工作机会
It's "Weird" to offer a job to a man

674
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,990
而作为回报  那个人却向你的汽车扔保龄球
and in return have bowling balls thrown at your car

675
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,660
在你工作午餐时派妓女来餐厅大闹

680
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,960
你听起来有点不太正常
Uh...you sound unhinged.

681
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,940
吉米  我对你的痛苦深表遗憾

685
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,990

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,320
那份工作  并没有让我生气
The job offer -- it didn't upset me.

687

反而让我觉得很好笑

00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,850
赫赫有名的HHM律所里举足轻重的职位

有机会走上那么大的舞台
Chance to play at the palace?

690
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,740
就凭我这种小角色
Lil' ole me?

691
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,340
-我只是想  -你根本不知道外面在发生什么
- I was trying - You have no idea what's going on.

692
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,210
你是一个只活在自己的小世界里
You're a teensy tiny man

693
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,230
只关注自己的小人
in a teensy-weensy little bubble!

694
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,250
吉米啊
Oh, Jimmy.

你有什么资格看不起我  可怜我
You look down on me?! You pity me?!

697
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,430
走就对了  霍华德
Walk away. That's right, Howard.

698
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,870
你知道我为什么不接受你的工作吗
You know why I didn't take the job?

699
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,940
因为它太渺小了
'Cause it's too small!

700
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,990
我不在乎这种工作
I don't care about it!

701
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,610
它对我来说屁都不是
It's nothing to me!

702
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,100
渺小到不能再渺小了
It's a bacterium!

703
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,110
我游走的世界大到你根本无法想像
I travel in worlds you can't even imagine!

704
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,720
你根本想像不到我的能力
You can't conceive of what I'm capable of!

705
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,930
我早就远远超越你了
I'm so far beyond you!

706
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,250
我是身着西装的上帝
I'm like a God in human clothing!

707
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,380
指尖射出闪电
Lightning bolts ‭shoot from my fingertips!
