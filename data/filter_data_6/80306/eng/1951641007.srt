1
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,124
A-hem! A-hem!

2
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:59,842
Bernard, is it important?
I must finish these Defence papers.

3
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,601
- This is more urgent, Minister.
- What is it?

4
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:07,204
Your Christmas cards, Minister.
They can't be postponed any longer.

5
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:11,126
- Eugh. Which is which?
- They're labelled.

6
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:15,963
These you sign Jim; these Jim Hacker; these
Jim and Annie; these Annie and Jim Hacker;

7
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,960
- these Love from Annie and Jim.
- And those?

8
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,803
Those are printed and those have cyclostyled
signatures so you needn't write anything.

9
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:28,677
Make sure none of them should have been
personally signed Jim or Jim Hacker

10
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:32,760
or Jim and Annie or Annie and Jim Hacker
or Love from Annie and Jim.

11
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:37,557
- What about those?
- Constituency cards. Your agent left them.

12
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:42,926
As you see, they've been divided up. Those
you sign Jim; those Jim Hacker; those Jim and...

13
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,079
Thank you, Bernard! I think I've got the gist.

14
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:49,523
- Is that it?
- Apart from the ones at Party headquarters.

15
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:53,885
- Party HQ? I didn't do those last year.
- You weren't Party Chairman last year.

16
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,959
Oh. Do I have to send this one?

17
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,199
- Why not?
- It's to Maurice in Brussels.

18
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:03,996
He forced through the plan
to standardise the Euro sausage.

19
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,998
Euro sausage?

20
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,046
Next year we'll be waving goodbye
to the good old British sausage,

21
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:14,883
forced to accept some foreign muck
like salami or bratwurst or something.

22
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,686
They can't stop us eating the British sausage!

23
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:23,205
They can stop us calling it a sausage.
It'll be called the emulsified high-fat offal tube!

24
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,722
And you swallowed it?

25
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:33,079
It's my job to implement EEC regulations.
It could finish my career.

26
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:38,321
- What have they got against our sausage?
- Don't you ever read the papers you give me?

27
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:41,126
I glanced at it, but it rather put me off.

28
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,085
Apparently, there's not enough meat in it.

29
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:49,844
"The average British sausage consists of
32.5% fat, 6.5% rind,

30
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:55,081
"20% water, 10% rusk, 5% seasoning,
preservative and colouring

31
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:57,522
"and only 26% meat,

32
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:01,839
"which is mostly gristle, head meat, other offcuts

33
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,726
"and mechanically-recovered meat...

34
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,401
"...steamed off the carcasses."

35
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,599
I don't feel particularly... I had one...

36
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,076
I had one for breakfast.

37
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:17,000
Perhaps the EEC commissioner is right.

38
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:21,046
He may be, but it'll be
extremely unpopular with the voters.

39
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,597
We shall just have to grit our teeth
and bite on the bullet.

40
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:29,761
You can't bite a bullet when gritting your teeth.
If you do that, you can't get a bullet...

41
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,246
Sorry.

42
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:36,640
By the way, you were going to advise me
what presents to get for the private office.

43
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:40,720
That's up to you. Bottles of sherry
for the assistant secretaries,

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,165
large boxes of mints for the diary secretary
and correspondence secretary

45
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:48,125
and small boxes of mints for the rest.

46
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,085
- What about my Personal Private Secretary?
- That's me.

47
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:57,637
- Ah, yes, of course! What should I give you?
- You don't have to give me anything.

48
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,765
- I know, but I'd like to.
- Oh, Minister...

49
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:04,044
- Well, anything, really.
- Such as?

50
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:06,641
Well, really I would like a surprise.

51
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,001
What sort of surprise should I give you?

52
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,886
A bottle of champagne is the customary surprise.

53
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:20,446
- What time is my meeting with Humphrey?
- That's been cancelled.

54
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,043
Sir Humphrey had an urgent meeting
with the Cabinet Secretary.

55
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:28,803
The Cabinet Secretary.
Always makes me feel rather nervous.

56
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:33,085
In some ways, Sir Arnold is
the most powerful chap in the country.

57
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:39,004
Permanent access to the PM, controls
Cabinet agenda, controls access to everything.

58
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,998
I wonder what he's up to?

59
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,878
- By the way, Humphrey...
- Yes?

60
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,800
I've decided to retire early.

61
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,401
Oh! Have you, Arnold?

62
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,683
In the New Year.

63
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,566
Ah...

64
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:04,726
My successor has to be someone
who can be firm with our political masters.

65
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,720
Absolutely. No nonsense with that lot!

66
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,640
- But tactful...
- Exactly.

67
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:15,437
- Suave, charming, emollient...
- And above all, sound.

68
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,041
Sound? Oh, yes, sound.

69
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,041
So my duty is to convey
a recommendation to the Prime Minister

70
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:27,998
as to which of the present Permanent
Secretaries best meets these stringent criteria.

71
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,043
And, er...

72
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:38,644
...Have you, er...
Er, er, is there, er... Does anyone, er...

73
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:45,360
You see, in this job, the problem isn't really
finding the answers, it's finding the questions.

74
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:49,156
We need the man who can find the key question.

75
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,637
By the way, Arnold,
to change the subject completely,

76
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:04,597
- what will you be doing when you retire?
- Ah, very good question!

77
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:09,282
- Very good question.
- There might be jobs you could pick up,

78
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:14,157
ways you could serve the country,
which your successor, whoever he might be,

79
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:17,444
could put your way -
er, persuade you to undertake!

80
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:23,358
I had been giving it some thought.
I'll be chairman of the Banque Occidentale

81
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:27,361
and there'll be directorships
of IBM and BP and so on.

82
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,722
- But I was thinking...
- Yes?

83
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,119
The Chairmanship of the Opera House Trust
will be coming up next year.

84
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:39,486
- Chairman of Covent Garden...
- And the chancellorship of Oxford.

85
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:43,526
The deputy chairmanship
of the Bank of England would be a...

86
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:47,475
...A challenge?
- A challenge, exactly.

87
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,400
And head of the Security Commission.

88
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:55,118
The presidency of the Anglo-Caribbean
Association would give one...

89
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,404
...a chance to be of service.

90
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,205
Precisely!

91
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,165
Especially during the winter months.

92
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,955
I'm sure any successor worth his salt
could arrange these.

93
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:12,915
Do you think so?
That's very reassuring, very reassuring.

94
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,681
But there is another thing.

95
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:21,683
Certain advice one may have given the Prime
Minister could, if it emerged, be misinterpreted.

96
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,806
- Er, what sort of advice?
- All sensible and reasonable,

97
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,118
but advice about using troops during strikes.

98
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,438
A very sensible precaution
that they should be armed,

99
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,486
but, taken out of context, machine guns...

100
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,764
Oh, I'm sure that need never come out.

101
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:45,877
And I did suggest negotiations with South Africa
about reactivating the Simonstown naval base.

102
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:51,246
Absolutely sensible strategically, of course,
and a great help with the Falklands,

103
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:56,003
but if one were in line for
Secretary-General of the Commonwealth...

104
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,797
Embarrassing. And you would be in line
to be Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.

105
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,401
Would I? How gratifying!

106
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:10,805
And I'm sure that the right successor would see
no problem in keeping those files under wraps.

107
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,286
Good.

108
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,007
Anyway, to get back to our original point,

109
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:20,924
I think my colleagues and I can see our way
forward to placing your name top of the list.

110
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,240
I see.

111
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:29,077
May I ask how many other names
will be on the list?

112
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,683
Oh, I don't think there's anyone else
who's up to scratch.

113
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,042
Have another drink.

114
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:41,957
By the way, I've accepted the presidency
of the Campaign for Freedom of Information.

115
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,405
Freedom of Information?! What on earth for?

116
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:51,960
Well, it's very popular with the Opposition, and
today's Opposition is tomorrow's government,

117
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:56,245
and it will mean one can ensure
that the freedom is not abused.

118
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:01,719
So, here's to the continuity of sound government.

119
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:04,526
And freedom of information.

120
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,396
- Whenever it's in the national interest.
- Oh, yes!

121
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,202
(HE HUMS)

122
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,005
- Minister, I have some very grave news.
- Yes, Humphrey?

123
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,920
The relationship, which I might tentatively aver

124
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:33,400
has been not without a degree of reciprocal
utility, and even occasional gratification,

125
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,719
is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation
and, to be brief,

126
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:41,277
is in the propinquity
of its ultimate, regrettable, termination.

127
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,286
I see.

128
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,599
- I'm... on my way out.
- What?

129
00:09:54,767 --> 00:10:00,239
There comes a time when one has to accept
what fate has in store, when one passes on...

130
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,920
Passes on?!

131
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,521
...to pastures new, perhaps greener...

132
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:10,205
...and places oneself finally in the service
of one who is greater than any of us.

133
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,996
- Humphrey, I'm so sorry!
- Thank you, Minister.

134
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,285
- Does Lady Appleby know?
- She's suspected it for some time.

135
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,086
- When did they tell you?
- This afternoon.

136
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,603
- How long do they give you?
- Just a few weeks.

137
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,086
Weeks?!

138
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:29,398
It'll give me enough time to sort everything out.

139
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,400
Humphrey, you're so terribly brave!

140
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:38,403
One is a little anxious. One is always wary of
the unknown, but I have faith I'll muddle through.

141
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,076
Minister, what's the matter?

142
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,836
I'm sorry, Humphrey.

143
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:53,125
It's just we've had our ups and downs, but...

144
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,279
Oh, Minister, don't take on so!

145
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,727
We'll still see one another regularly.

146
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,725
- Yes, once a week at least.
- What?

147
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,879
- I haven't told you where I'm going yet.
- Eh?

148
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:14,477
I have been appointed Secretary to the Cabinet.

149
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,676
- Secretary to the Cabinet?
- Why, what did you think?

150
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,997
I... I thought... I thought...

151
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:27,083
Sorry about crying.
I'm not myself today, a little tired.

152
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:30,719
Overwrought. Things have been, you know...

153
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,639
I am so sorry.

154
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:37,722
Perhaps as Cabinet Secretary designate
I should suggest some lightening of the load...

155
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,562
- No, no. Don't misunderstand me. I'm fine, fine!
- Good, good.

156
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:45,037
- So, you're going to be Cabinet Secretary.
- Yes.

157
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,767
- Cabinet Secretary!
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,600
- Secretary to the Cabinet!
- YES!

159
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,396
- That's a great honour. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

160
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:58,037
- 'Course, that means that you and I...
- Alas, yes.

161
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:01,119
- How shall I manage?
- Probably even better without me.

162
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,484
Yes, I probably... No, no, certainly not, no!

163
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:10,085
So you're going to do for the Prime Minister
what you've always done to me.

164
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,646
For me!

165
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,155
PM's right-hand man.

166
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:19,240
- Advising on issues.
- Quite so.

167
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,286
And, er, and people, no doubt.

168
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,244
Minister?

169
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,956
- Humphrey...
- Yes, Minister?

170
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:33,484
I want you to know
I think you've been absolutely wonderful.

171
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:38,996
Highest admiration for all you've done.
Wonderful work. Wonderful work.

172
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,716
- Finest tradition of the service.
- Minister, you're too kind.

173
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,357
I just hope you feel that I... In my...

174
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,322
When things are... Well, it...

175
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,682
If it should come up, er...

176
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:56,078
I think we've made
a jolly good team here, you and I?

177
00:12:56,247 --> 00:13:01,367
- I couldn't have wished for a better Minister.
- Humphrey, you're too kind!

178
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,165
When are you going to tell the staff?

179
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,239
On Friday evening, just before it's promulgated.

180
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:13,765
- I will bid them farewell at the Christmas party.
- That will certainly make it a happy occasion!

181
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:18,122
- And sad.
- Sad, yes, sad.

182
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,039
Terribly sad.

183
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:24,046
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, thank you, Minister.

184
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,517
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, Minister. Lovely party.

185
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:32,238
- Yes, it's frightfully good fun.
- Always good to let your hair down.

186
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:40,199
Right, now I think it's time I said a few words.

187
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:44,437
This is a very, very special occasion for us all.

188
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,838
Peace on Earth, goodwill to all men.

189
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,123
Sorry, persons!

190
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:55,961
It's always good to have this little get-together
amongst the people who've served me, er...

191
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:01,326
...worked with me... for me... no, with me
here at the Department of Adminis...

192
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,563
...Ministry of Administr...

193
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,478
...at the DAA.

194
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:13,604
We're a team, like the Cabinet,
except we're all on the same side...

195
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,879
Not that the Cabinet...
Well, I meant... really, the shadow Cabinet.

196
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,164
Let's keep politics out of this. Season of goodwill.

197
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:27,319
That's why Parliament doesn't sit over Christmas!

198
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:34,636
Season of goodwill. Even to one's officials!

199
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,486
Well, what can I say? Humphrey.

200
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,117
(BERNARD) Sir Humphrey Appleby!
(ALL) Sir Humphrey Appleby!

201
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:49,998
Thank you. I'd just like to thank you all for
all the hard work you've done all these years.

202
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:56,561
An occasion like this engenders a certain
emotional ambiguity and personal ambivalence.

203
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,003
- What's he ambigulous about?
- While one is, one should say,

204
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:04,319
honoured by the cause of one's departure,
one is saddened by the fact of it -

205
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:11,006
in particular, saddened to leave the service of
a Minister without parallel in one's experience.

206
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,317
I say, that's jolly decent.

207
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,160
- A unique partnership.
- Absolutely unique.

208
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,763
So I should end by wishing
a happy Christmas to you all,

209
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:24,523
but in particular to a Minister whom,
in the brief time we've had him with us

210
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:28,999
we've watched grow in standing,
stature and sureness of touch.

211
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,637
So, seasonal felicitations to you all,

212
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,756
but please, please, do remember
the Home Secretary's campaign for the holiday:

213
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,521
Don't drink and drive this Christmas.

214
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,360
I'll drink to that! ...Oh, dear, I'm sorry!

215
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:51,517
- I do wish you'd let me drive, Jim.
- I'm driving perfectly stably.

216
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,599
True, but we have to get home before dawn!

217
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,440
Good evening, Cinstable. Happy Crispsmas.

218
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,519
- May I see your licence, sir?
- Certainly.

219
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:35,077
- Aren't you Mr Jim Hacker?
- That's right.

220
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:40,116
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Any reason you were driving so slowly?

221
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,721
I didn't want the kerb to hit me...

222
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:46,004
I didn't want to hit the kerb.

223
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,557
Look, I've got a silver badge somewhere.

224
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:54,676
- I see. Perhaps Constable Evans can drive you.
- It's all right, Officer. I'll drive.

225
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,123
OK, Mrs Hacker.
If you're in a proper state to drive.

226
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,996
I don't drink, Officer.
Well, not when my husband's driving.

227
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,121
Nor do I, hardly.

228
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:14,484
- There we are.
- Nice little place you have here, Humphrey.

229
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:18,435
- Thank you.
- You handled your first Cabinet meeting well.

230
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:23,203
- What was it like sitting next to the PM?
- Do sit down, Minister.

231
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:29,397
I've asked you to drop in for a coffee because
the Home Office informs me of a traffic incident.

232
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,886
Oh.

233
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:34,039
- Yes, I see.
- It's entirely your own affair...

234
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
- Precisely.
- But the PM takes a grave view.

235
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:41,717
- He feels Ministers should set an example.
- You're not ticking me off, are you?

236
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,324
Far be it from me, I'm only a servant
of the Cabinet, a humble functionary.

237
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,718
But I need to assure the Home Office
it won't occur again.

238
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:54,358
- What do they give us silver badges for?
- It's a very special privilege, Minister.

239
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:59,647
It allows us to pass through police cordons
and park in prohibited areas and so forth.

240
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,924
It is not to protect drunks who drive cars.

241
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:09,755
I will not be lectured by a functionary,
even one as humble as your good self.

242
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:14,717
- I'm a Minister of the Crown.
- Yes, of course. I do apologise.

243
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,926
I will inform the Crown of the incident
if that is your wish.

244
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,365
I...

245
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:29,638
Now I think of it,
you can tell the Home Office I take the point.

246
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:34,756
- Thank you, Minister.
- Does the Home Secretary himself know?

247
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,202
It hardly matters.

248
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,804
I'm afraid the Home Secretary
has not been as lucky as you were,

249
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,606
which is why he wasn't at Cabinet.

250
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:51,242
As you're aware, he initiated this
"Don't drink and drive at Christmas" campaign

251
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:53,682
and ordered the police to "get tough".

252
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,599
Well, unfortunately...

253
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:01,515
...he, too, was picked up last night
for drunken driving in his own constituency.

254
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,479
Have you seen the first edition of the Standard?

255
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:15,440
- Where on earth was his security man?
- He'd given him the slip.

256
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:18,599
You know how cunning these drunks can be.

257
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:24,036
Couldn't they have hushed it up?
Silver badge job?

258
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:30,396
His case was rather different. He caused
a lorry to overturn. It was full of nuclear waste.

259
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:38,797
Then he rebounded from the lorry into a private
car driven by the editor of a local newspaper.

260
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,286
Oh, no.

261
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,405
- Inevitably, it leaked out.
- The nuclear waste?

262
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,159
No, the story.

263
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:50,602
- The Home Secretary will have to resign.
- Alas, yes.

264
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,235
- What will happen to him?
- Well...

265
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:59,164
I gather he was as drunk as a lord, so after a
discreet interval, they'll probably make him one!

266
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,520
He's obviously been held up.

267
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,525
You can stamp some cards if you like.

268
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,757
- Aren't they to constituents?
- Yes.

269
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:15,684
That's not government business, that's political
activity. I'm not allowed to help with that.

270
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,281
- If they're to journalists?
- That'd be OK.

271
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,722
- They're to journalists.
- Fine.

272
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:25,405
I suppose licking is an essential part
of relationships with the press.

273
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:31,645
- I hear the reshuffle is about to be announced.
- It may be on the news.

274
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:36,005
I like to watch the news. It's my best chance
of finding out where Jim is.

275
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:41,161
<i>(NEWSREADER)... There was no question of</i>
<i>American military personnel getting involved.</i>

276
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:45,320
<i>We've j'ust had a newsflash</i>
<i>from Number 10 Downing Street.</i>

277
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,604
<i>The Prime Minister</i>
<i>is to retire early in the New Year.</i>

278
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,645
<i>He does not want to serve</i>
<i>in another Parliament,</i>

279
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:55,083
<i>giving his successor a good run-up</i>
<i>to the next election.</i>

280
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,364
<i>We'll bring you further news as soon as we can.</i>

281
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,802
(ALL) Have you heard?
(ALL) Yes!

282
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:04,801
- The emergency Cabinet meeting was to tell us.
- Why so suddenly?

283
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:10,724
He said to give his successor a good run-up to
the next election, so that can't be the reason.

284
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:14,562
- Why, then?
- Some extraordinary rumours are going about.

285
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,480
The left say he's a secret CIA agent.

286
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:22,767
- The right say he's a secret KGB agent.
- Minister, I've heard something quite different,

287
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:27,717
that there is £1 million-worth of diamonds
from South Africa in a Downing Street safe,

288
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,037
- but it's only a rumour.
- Is that true?

289
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,526
Yes.

290
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:36,122
So, there ARE all those diamonds
in Downing Street!

291
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,676
- Are there?
- You said there were!

292
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,599
- I didn't.
- You did!

293
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:44,396
- I said is the rumour true, you said yes!
- True it's a rumour.

294
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,876
- You heard it was true!
- True I heard it!

295
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:51,518
- Sorry to cut in, but do you believe it?
- I believe I heard it.

296
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:55,157
- Oh, about the diamonds? No.
- Is it impossible?

297
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:58,285
No, but it's never been officially denied.

298
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:02,804
First rule of politics:
Never believe anything until it's officially denied.

299
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,437
- Will there be a general election?
- There's no need.

300
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,997
The majority's big enough.
We'll just choose a new leader.

301
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,681
- Do you want the job?
- Me? No chance!

302
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,361
It'll either be Eric or Duncan.

303
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,439
It should have been Ray. He was Deputy Leader.

304
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,485
But as he's had to resign as Home Secretary...

305
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:27,121
- Of course! That's why the PM resigned!
- (BERNARD) Why?

306
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:33,044
He's always hated Ray. He just hung on
to make sure his deputy didn't get the leadership!

307
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,159
Like Attlee and Morrison.

308
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:40,957
So the resignation is to give time for
the new leader to be run in before the election?

309
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:46,360
- Now that the Home Secretary's been run in!
- Eric wants my support for the leadership.

310
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:50,759
He could be the right man.
He's been a fairly successful Chancellor.

311
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,761
I've already indicated that I'm... on his side.

312
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,602
- What about Duncan?
- Yes, Duncan could be the man.

313
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,565
He's done fairly well at the Foreign Office.

314
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:05,800
- I think I'll support Duncan.
- You're supporting Eric AND Duncan?

315
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:10,199
It's all very well, but if I support Eric
and Duncan gets it, that's it.

316
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:14,485
- If I support Duncan and Eric gets it, that's it.
- Don't support either!

317
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,844
- Whoever gets it, that's it.
- So who are you supporting?

318
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,759
Duncan.

319
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,286
Or Eric.

320
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:29,525
Duncan's so divisive.
It really would be for the good of the party,

321
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,236
- the good of the country...
- Eric, I don't see how I can.

322
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:37,320
Your support would be crucial.
You're universally popular...

323
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:40,001
- I don't know...
- Good public image...

324
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,556
- Yes...
- Regarded as sound.

325
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,639
- Am I?
- So, if you put your weight behind me...

326
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:49,004
You see my problem as chairman of the party.

327
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:53,080
- What would happen if Duncan got it? Disaster!
- Well...

328
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:56,523
Tell you what.
I wouldn't keep him at the Foreign Office.

329
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,875
I'd look for a new Foreign Secretary.

330
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:08,039
But as I said, I must appear impartial.

331
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:13,758
But if there could be ways of hinting
at my support for you...

332
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,599
...in a perfectly impartial way...

333
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:28,275
- But Duncan, as chairman of the party...
- As such you carry even more weight.

334
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,723
You haven't got any real enemies.
Not yet, anyway.

335
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,765
But it's my job to be impartial.

336
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:38,966
- If Eric got into Number 10 it'd be catastrophic.
- Yes...

337
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:42,164
Jim, we're on the same side, aren't we?

338
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,640
- Yes.
- Good.

339
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:48,277
I'm going to win and I never forgive people
who let me down.

340
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,965
I can't make my support too public.

341
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:58,405
It doesn't have to be public,
just so long as everybody knows.

342
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:03,765
Then when I'm in Number 10,
and Eric's in Northern Ireland...

343
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:12,203
- we know who'll be the next Chancellor, don't we?
- Do we?

344
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,877
You mean...?

345
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:19,399
Unless you fancy Northern Ireland yourself?

346
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:31,960
How are things
at the Campaign for the Freedom of Information?

347
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,402
Sorry, I can't talk about that.

348
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:45,476
So, will the new PM be our eminent Chancellor,
or our distinguished Foreign Secretary?

349
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:48,445
Well, which do you think it should be?

350
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:53,397
Difficult. Like asking which lunatic
should run the asylum.

351
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:58,687
Trouble is, they're both interventionists,
with notions about running the country themselves

352
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,680
- if they became PM.
- Have we any allies?

353
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,520
Quite a few, the Chief Whip particularly.

354
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:09,317
He's worried that whichever gets the job
will antagonise the other's supporters

355
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:13,765
- and split the party.
- So we need a compromise candidate.

356
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,963
Hmm. Malleable.

357
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:17,685
- Flexible.
- Likeable.

358
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,838
- No firm opinions.
- No bright ideas.

359
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:25,604
- Not intellectually committed.
- No strength of purpose to change anything.

360
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:29,885
Someone who can be
manipulated, professionally guided.

361
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,960
And leave the business of government
in the hands of the experts.

362
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,763
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
It's impossible.

363
00:26:56,927 --> 00:27:03,446
Why? A lot of the government
would welcome a less-interventionist leader.

364
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:07,236
- Not the other two candidates!
- They might be persuaded.

365
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:12,162
- What, to stand aside?
- Yes. Have you seen their Ml5 files?

366
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:17,199
- No.
- Always send for Cabinet Ministers' Ml5 files

367
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,881
if you enjoy a good laugh!

368
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:23,997
- Oh, Bernard.
- Sir.

369
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,601
- Just...
- Thank you very much.

370
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,917
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

371
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,165
- Happy New Year, by the way.
- Thank you.

372
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:35,840
Right.

373
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,360
So...

374
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:44,080
...this is our very last piece of DAA business.
- Yes, I'm afraid so, Sir Humphrey.

375
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,760
Ah, well.

376
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:50,123
Bernard, just let me ask you something.

377
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,884
What would you say to your present master...

378
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:58,755
...as the next Prime Minister?

379
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,804
- The Minister?
- Yes.

380
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,844
- Mr Hacker?
- Yes.

381
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:09,241
- As Prime Minister?
- Yes.

382
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:15,205
- Are you in a hurry?
- Just checking it's not April 1st.

383
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:24,039
Are you suggesting your Minister
is not up to the job of Prime Minister?

384
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,880
Oh, no, Sir Arnold, it's not for me to, er...

385
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:31,120
Well, I mean...
Of course, I'm... I'm sure he's, er...

386
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,360
Oh, gosh!

387
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:38,964
There is a body of opinion
that sees many advantages in the appointment.

388
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,516
- For Britain.
- For Britain.

389
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,759
- Yes, well, yes...
- So we trust you

390
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:50,604
to ensure your Minister does nothing incisive
or divisive over the next few weeks.

391
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:56,922
- Avoids anything controversial.
- Expresses no firm opinion about anything.

392
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:03,484
- Now, is that quite clear?
- I think that's what he was planning anyway.

393
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:13,842
What's it all for, Bernard? What are we all doing?
What does it all mean?

394
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,646
I didn't read theology, Minister.

395
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:20,356
The waste of it all.
Take that EEC reception last night.

396
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:26,636
Humphrey introduced me to an official
who pays farmers to produce surplus food

397
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:32,757
and then he introduced me to another official
who pays others to destroy all the surpluses.

398
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:38,399
Then they pay thousands of bureaucrats
to push masses of paper round to make it all work.

399
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:43,846
- Doesn't the futility of it all depress you?
- Not really. I'm a civil servant.

400
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,920
I've been talking to Eric and Duncan.

401
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,839
I think I've promised to support Eric's candidature.

402
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:56,841
- I see.
- Then I think I promised to support Duncan's.

403
00:29:57,007 --> 00:30:02,161
- That sounds very even-handed, Minister.
- But I can't keep both promises. Sherry?

404
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:06,639
- Thank you. They were only political promises.
- Yes... What do you mean?

405
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:11,040
I mean, like your manifesto promises,
people understand.

406
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,526
Yes.

407
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:18,444
Trouble is, I can't remember either of them
making any categorical promises to me.

408
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:22,919
- Then you have no problem.
- I have. I've still to decide who to support.

409
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,682
It's not just picking the winner.
My support could tip the balance.

410
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:31,557
The question is, do I want to be Foreign
Secretary or Chancellor of the Exchequer?

411
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,400
- Neither, do you?
- Why not?

412
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,127
They're both such terrible jobs!

413
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:40,518
You're talking about two
of the top three Cabinet jobs.

414
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,086
I realise that.

415
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,956
- As a civil servant, you don't understand politics.
- Sorry.

416
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:48,687
To be a success, you have to be in the limelight.

417
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,875
You have a very high profile as Chancellor of
the Exchequer, and that has to be good for votes.

418
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:57,926
- You see now, don't you?
- But with respect, Minister...

419
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:02,126
The Chancellor is Mr Killjoy.
Raising taxes on beer and cigarettes

420
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:06,565
and cutting down public spending
goes down badly with the electorate.

421
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:13,600
Maybe I don't want to be Chancellor
of the Exchequer. There's no escape in that job.

422
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:18,887
No, Minister. Unless you're sent to the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office as a punishment.

423
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:21,720
- Punishment?
- It's an even worse job.

424
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:24,321
- No votes in Foreign Affairs?
- Exactly.

425
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:28,036
The FCO loves foreigners,
but the British people don't.

426
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,799
Quite.

427
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:34,440
As far as world politics goes,
the Foreign Office is an irrelevance.

428
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:38,998
We've no real power.
We're just an American missile base!

429
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,646
Yes, Minister.

430
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:43,640
Between the devil and the deep blue sea.

431
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:47,038
Unless... Of course, there is one other option.

432
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,801
- What other option?
- Do the middle job.

433
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:55,644
Middle job? What, Home Secretary? Responsible
for all the muggings, jailbreaks and race riots?

434
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:59,925
- No, thank you!
- No, be the one who takes all the credit.

435
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,845
What do you mean? You mean...?

436
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,516
You don't mean...?

437
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:13,319
You do mean...?

438
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,799
How's it all looking from the Chief Whip's office?

439
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,801
If Eric gets it
we'll have a party split in three months.

440
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,242
If it's Duncan, it'll take three weeks.

441
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:27,116
Geoffrey, the PM's asked me
to take you into my confidence.

442
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:33,237
I shouldn't be telling you this, but there are,
how shall I say, security question marks

443
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:35,875
over both the current candidates.

444
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:39,926
- What question marks?
- Alas, I can say no more.

445
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:45,442
The only person I can disclose this to
in the PM's absence,

446
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:49,316
and as it is essentially a party matter,
is the chairman of the party.

447
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,921
- Jim Hacker.
- He's promised to join us.

448
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:56,478
But in the meantime, do you think the party
can find a compromise candidate?

449
00:32:56,647 --> 00:33:03,200
- Could be any one of half a dozen.
- Have you considered the party chairman?

450
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,083
Jim Hacker?!

451
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,482
Jim Hacker...

452
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,956
Yes, it is possible, isn't it?

453
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:17,006
After all, there have been
less likely Prime Ministers.

454
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,280
Yes...

455
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,720
Who?

456
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,486
Oh, there must have been!

457
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,763
(BUZZER)

458
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:31,761
Yes? Oh, all right. Send him in.

459
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,281
Minister, so good of you to call.

460
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,199
- Henry.
- Morning.

461
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,676
Do sit down. Minister...

462
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,237
...I have a problem and I need your help.

463
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,285
Oh, dear! Can't you run the country on your own?

464
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:55,120
- It is a rather grave matter, I'm afraid.
- Yes, of course.

465
00:33:56,207 --> 00:34:01,406
It's to do with the leadership election. The PM
felt we had no alternative but to call you in.

466
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,285
That bad, eh?

467
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,925
There are certain items of confidential information

468
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,921
which, while in theory might be susceptible
of innocent interpretation,

469
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:14,966
do nevertheless contain
a sufficient element of ambiguity,

470
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:19,325
so that were they to be presented
in a less than generous manner,

471
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:23,162
might be a source
of great embarrassment and even hazard

472
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:29,004
were they to impinge upon the deliberations
of an office of more than usual sensitivity.

473
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,478
I'm sorry?

474
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:39,003
- He's talking about security question marks.
- Security? What do you mean?

475
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,204
- Secrets.
- I know what security means.

476
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:45,837
- But what do you mean?
- I'm not allowed to know.

477
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,804
- Why not?
- Security.

478
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:55,278
So, since in the PM's absence
you are deputising on party matters,

479
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:59,565
may I show you the security file
on the Chancellor of the Exchequer?

480
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:03,163
Technically, I can't show you any of it, but, er...

481
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:11,205
...under the circumstances,
I feel I can show you relevant items.

482
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:15,076
Here's a summary of the reports
from the security services.

483
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,318
Special Branch...

484
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,045
There we are.

485
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,846
Interview with his driver.

486
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:28,758
And the PM's confidential memo.

487
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,284
- Strictest secrecy, of course.
- Of course.

488
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:38,598
Dirty old...!

489
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:43,800
You wouldn't have thought he had the time,

490
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,197
a workaholic like Eric.

491
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:50,519
I've found that people who are highly active
in one area of life

492
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,326
tend to be equally active in all the others.

493
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,637
You wouldn't think he went in for...

494
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:59,959
I understand the current expression
is horizontal jogging, Minister.

495
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:07,202
All this was some time ago
and it doesn't seem very conclusive.

496
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,677
That's why the PM thought it all right
for him to be Chancellor.

497
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:14,078
But the Yugoslavian one
and the two South Africans,

498
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,125
not to mention the shady lady from Argentina...

499
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:22,077
- And it's thought she's just a cover anyway.
- Cover? What for?

500
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,726
Good heavens!

501
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:29,519
If all these ladies were just covers,
what on earth were his real requirements?

502
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,804
- I really can't tell you.
- Ooh!

503
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:39,995
So it was thought that Defence
and the Foreign Office might be too delicate.

504
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:43,523
- I can see that!
- Then, if he were PM...

505
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:47,123
he'd be head of security services as well.
It's unthinkable.

506
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:53,157
- You're saying it's got to be Duncan.
- I was coming to that. This is his file.

507
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:56,316
Special Branch again.

508
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:59,320
Then we have the Fraud Squad...

509
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:02,517
Inland Revenue...

510
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,760
Secret auditors' reports, Bank of England
foreign exchange division...

511
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,282
How much do you want?

512
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:12,564
All this was technically legal at the time, wasn't it?

513
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:17,562
Yes, it may have been technically, but it ruled
him out of consideration for the Treasury.

514
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:20,605
How did they get all this - Ml5?

515
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:25,079
Er, well, let's just say
it's all been gone into quite enough.

516
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,283
Like the shady lady!

517
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:34,282
- Isn't it all astounding, all this?
- I don't know. I haven't seen it!

518
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,722
- Humphrey, don't think me foolish...
- Oh, Minister, perish the thought!

519
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:46,085
- Forgive me, Geoffrey. Why are you here?
- We dare not allow these scandals.

520
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:50,286
If they are so embarrassing,
it would embarrass the country and the party

521
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,915
if either of them became head of government.

522
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:56,875
- We can't be caught with our trousers down.
- Like Eric!

523
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,365
I see.

524
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,523
Yes, this is serious.

525
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,643
- Very serious.
- Very serious.

526
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:10,244
- What could happen if one them became PM?
- Something very serious indeed.

527
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,602
- Very serious.
- I see.

528
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:16,801
- Serious repercussions...
- Serious repercussions...

529
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,401
...of the utmost seriousness.

530
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:22,401
Yes, that is serious.

531
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:27,561
In fact, I would go so far as to say
that it could hardly be more serious.

532
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:33,323
Well, I think we're all agreed, then, this is serious.

533
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:34,920
Yes.

534
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,282
What happens now?

535
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:40,280
The party needs to agree
on another candidate, quick.

536
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:44,884
- The Chief Whip wondered if you had any ideas.
- As you're Party Chairman.

537
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:47,515
Well, it's rather difficult.

538
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:53,478
You're looking for somebody with outstanding
qualities, a potential Prime Minister.

539
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,320
- Someone who's sound.
- Yes.

540
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,926
Likeable.

541
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,525
Flexible.

542
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:04,917
Yes. Normal.

543
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,085
- Solvent.
- Yes.

544
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,603
And acceptable to both wings of the party.

545
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,680
And someone who understands
how to take advice, Minister.

546
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:18,963
Yes. Well...

547
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,400
Gosh! Who can I suggest?

548
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,757
- Have you thought of doing the job yourself?
- Me?!

549
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:31,078
- Why not?
- Wouldn't you want to be Prime Minister?

550
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:36,241
I'd love to be, but... It's a very big job.
I'm not sure I could. Prime Minister!

551
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,798
Perhaps the Minister feels
he's not absolutely Prime Ministerial calibre.

552
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:45,961
- There isn't any doubt about that, Humphrey.
- No, not in my mind. But you seem hesitant.

553
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:49,676
Modesty forbids.
But I have no doubt I can do the job.

554
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:53,999
- Modestly put, Minister.
- There's only one fly in the ointment.

555
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:59,161
You're a bit of an outsider. Can you organise
some public success in the next few days?

556
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:03,366
A tall order.
I'm up to my neck in the Euro sausage!

557
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:09,440
Won't it be enough to start campaigning,
let people know I want the job?

558
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,600
Quite the reverse!
Better to let people know you DON'T want it.

559
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:17,203
- Would that be enough?
- If you tell everybody that, yes.

560
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:22,043
Leave the campaigning to me.
Say you have no ambitions in that direction.

561
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:26,485
Yes. But supposing somebody says,
"Does that mean you refuse to stand?"

562
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:31,402
- You know how the media try to trap you.
- Minister, it's not my place, but, er,

563
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:36,800
previously the acceptable answer has been,
"While one does not seek the office,

564
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,004
"one has pledged oneself
to the service of one's country,

565
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:44,843
"and if one's friends were to persuade one
that was the best way one could serve,

566
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:51,799
"one might have to accept the responsibility
whatever one's own private wishes might be."

567
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:02,683
"...private wishes might be."
Yes, I think I've got that.

568
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,044
So, it's a three-way election, then.

569
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:10,200
Ideally, it should be an unopposed election.
Unity sits well with the public.

570
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,518
- The party will welcome that.
- Eric and Duncan won't!

571
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:16,406
Eric and Duncan must be persuaded to withdraw.

572
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:23,717
- Oh. You mean you'll have a word with them.
- I can't. I haven't seen the files.

573
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,800
- Humphrey, then.
- No, it's an internal party matter.

574
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:30,845
- It would be most improper.
- Well, who...

575
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:34,843
You don't mean...?

576
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:38,158
- I can't!
- No one else can.

577
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:43,796
You want me to tell one of my colleagues
he's a swindler and the other he's a pervert!

578
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:49,124
Not in so many words! Say you don't believe
they've done anything wrong.

579
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:53,678
- Just let them know you know something.
- They'll tell me to mind my own business!

580
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:59,399
Then you say, as Chairman, it's your duty to see
the information reaches those who need to know.

581
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:04,960
The Party Executive, major contributors,
elder statesmen, patrons, the Palace, perhaps.

582
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:10,040
Tell each of them
they have no alternative but to pull out

583
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:13,244
and support someone who will protect them.

584
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,319
You want me to protect them?

585
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:20,799
It's nobody else's business
as long as security's not involved.

586
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:25,995
- I don't have the stomach for the task.
- You have no choice now that you know.

587
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:30,843
Nobody else knows that I know.
Let's just forget all about it!

588
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,243
- That would be very courageous.
- Courageous? Why?

589
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:41,118
If anything were to happen and it later emerged
you had the information and suppressed it...

590
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:46,805
- You mean you'd leak it?
- Covering up for your chums...

591
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:50,960
Greater love hath no man than this,
that he should lay down his career.

592
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:53,402
Humphrey, you're threatening me!

593
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,675
No, Minister, I'm helping you.

594
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:03,685
You see, Jim, there's one other quality
Prime Ministers need.

595
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,883
The killer instinct.

596
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,243
The killer instinct.

597
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,286
Yes.

598
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,479
Ah, thanks.

599
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:21,119
- Well, here's to Number 10, eh?
- Thanks... I mean, yes.

600
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,085
What's up, Jim?

601
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,158
Duncan...

602
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:37,524
...I have a problem.
- You're not going to support me.

603
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:39,757
- Yes. No.
- Yes, no?

604
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,280
Exactly.

605
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,757
Some information has come my way.

606
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,885
- Oh, yes?
- Serious information.

607
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:54,839
- Concerning your personal... financial operations.
- I beg your pardon?

608
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,046
- About the collapse of Continental and General.
- That was just bad luck.

609
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:02,404
The transfer of funds
to directors' nominee companies.

610
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:05,877
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Technically, but...

611
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:09,926
...in conjunction with a similar case
at Offshore Securities?

612
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:15,322
- Where did you get all this?
- Sorry, but if you're running for PM

613
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,925
I shall feel obliged to share what I know
with senior party members.

614
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:27,037
If it came out into the open, there'd have to be
an enquiry by the Inland Revenue, Fraud Squad.

615
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,636
None of that need matter
if it's all above-board.

616
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:35,924
And I'm sure it is, if you say so, Duncan.

617
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:44,406
- There was nothing improper.
- Good, then I'm free to talk about it,

618
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,639
- bring it all out into the open.
- Hold on!

619
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:51,641
Financial matters can be misinterpreted.
People will misunderstand.

620
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,399
How true.

621
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:57,845
Look, Jim, I'm not sure
that I really want Number 10.

622
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:04,282
The Foreign Office is a better job in many ways.
But I won't support Eric.

623
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:08,155
Suppose Eric didn't get it?

624
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:14,837
How would it be if you were to transfer
all your support to someone else?

625
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,326
Who?

626
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:20,002
It would have to be somebody
who recognised your qualities,

627
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,886
who'd want you to stay at the Foreign Office.

628
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:26,642
Someone who could be discreet
about Continental and General.

629
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:30,001
Someone you could trust.

630
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:32,877
An old friend.

631
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,236
Do you mean you?

632
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:43,525
Me? I have absolutely no ambition
in that direction.

633
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,882
You DO mean you!

634
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,438
- I see.
- You do realise this is serious, Eric?

635
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,997
- Yes. And you're not going to help me, right?
- Yes.

636
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,283
- You are or you're not?
- Yes.

637
00:45:57,447 --> 00:46:01,963
- Jim!
- I'm going to help you, but not to become PM.

638
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:07,042
- You said you were.
- Until I heard about the lady from Argentina.

639
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,525
- And others.
- I see.

640
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:13,601
As Party Chairman I have my duty.

641
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:18,557
It'd be a disaster for the party
if you became PM and all this came out.

642
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:22,800
I wouldn't care to have to explain it
to Her Majesty.

643
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,798
Would you?

644
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:27,957
I'll withdraw.

645
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,561
I think that's very sensible.

646
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,439
So we'll say no more about it to anyone.

647
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:36,359
Thanks, Jim.

648
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:41,555
- So Duncan will get Number 10. My God!
- Not if I can help it.

649
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:44,525
- Who, then?
- Cheers.

650
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:49,644
- You don't mean YOU?
- Me?

651
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:55,643
Our children are reaching the age where Annie
and I are hoping to spend more time together.

652
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:57,684
You DO mean you!

653
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,961
- Minister.
- Humphrey, what's the hurry?

654
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:06,119
I've arranged a brief meeting
with the European Commissioner.

655
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:08,118
Maurice? He flew out this morning.

656
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,676
- His flight's been delayed.
- So?

657
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,522
We might persuade him
to solve our sausage problem.

658
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,678
- How?
- (PHONE RINGS)

659
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:19,281
Excuse me... Yes?

660
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:22,837
Oh, yes, ask him to come in, will you?
Thank you.

661
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,560
Leave it to me.

662
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,363
Just, er, just give me support when I ask for it.

663
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:35,359
- Ah, Maurice, how nice to see you.
- Humphrey.

664
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:39,486
- You know each other.
- Jim, to what do I owe this pleasure?

665
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:45,444
The Minister asked me to arrange this meeting

666
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:48,963
- to see if you could help us with a problem.
- Problem.

667
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,480
Of course.

668
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:55,198
The problem is that the EEC
is becoming very unpopular over here.

669
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,437
- Isn't that so?
- Very unpopular.

670
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,643
- You want to restore its image?
- Yes.

671
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:01,445
- No.
- No.

672
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:05,997
The Minister feels there would be more votes...

673
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:09,603
...that he would be better expressing
the views of the British people

674
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:14,443
by joining the attack on the EEC
rather than leaping to its defence.

675
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:18,361
- Exactly.
- But your party's committed to support us!

676
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,723
The Minister's point, as I understand it,

677
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:27,402
is that the commitment
is to the concept and the treaty.

678
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,525
- Treaty.
- It's not committed to the institutions,

679
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,599
nor to the practices, nor to individual policies.

680
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:38,602
The Minister was giving me an example
the other day, weren't you, Minister?

681
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,397
- About food production.
- Oh, yes.

682
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:49,561
I've discovered one of your officials
pays farmers to produce masses of surplus food

683
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:53,037
while the next office pays people
to destroy the surpluses.

684
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:55,767
- That's not true!
- No?

685
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:58,805
It's not the next office, not even the same floor!

686
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:04,439
- The Minister has hundreds of similar examples.
- Hundreds.

687
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:09,965
The nub of the problem is, the Minister is
starting to think that a member of the Cabinet

688
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:13,358
ought to start telling
the British people about them.

689
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:16,041
But that would be intolerable!

690
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:19,005
Even the Italians wouldn't stoop that low!

691
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:25,322
The Italians aren't being asked to redesignate
salami as emulsified high-fat offal tubing.

692
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,726
Ah!

693
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:32,716
And what are you proposing?

694
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:37,756
After all, we are committed to harmonisation.
We cannot call it a sausage.

695
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:40,236
What do you suggest?

696
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:43,806
Well, politics is about presentation.

697
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,198
Why don't we call it "the British sausage"?

698
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:50,884
British sausage? Saucisse Anglaise.

699
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:54,437
Salsiccia Inglese. Britisherwurst.

700
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:59,237
Yes, I think we could...
recommend that to the Commission.

701
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:00,726
Splendid!

702
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:05,119
The Minister's always said the EEC
is a splendid institution, haven't you?

703
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:06,766
Splendid!

704
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:16,600
- The European correspondents are here now.
- Good. Let 'em in.

705
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,519
Send them in.

706
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:22,760
- This is about the Euro sausage problem?
- That's right, Bernard.

707
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:25,760
- That you've solved it.
- No, Bernard.

708
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:29,840
Solved problems aren't news.
To the press, bad news is good news.

709
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:34,444
I'm not going to give them a non-story today.
I'll give them a disaster today

710
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:37,405
- and a triumph tomorrow.
- I see.

711
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:40,641
- Good morning, gentlemen!
- (ALL) Morning.

712
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:43,640
Do sit down. Good of you to come.

713
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:49,564
This is on a lobby basis, non-attributable.
We've got some trouble coming up with Brussels.

714
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:54,676
Somebody's going to tell you some time,
so I might as well tell you myself.

715
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,285
The trouble is, Brussels is about
to make the British sausage illegal

716
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:03,200
- under EEC regulations.
- Minister...

717
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:08,885
...not making the sausage illegal, just the name.
- Thank you, Bernard. I'll deal with that later.

718
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:12,278
- What do you mean, "illegal"?
- Effectively illegal.

719
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:17,840
The pork sausage will have to contain
75% lean pork. The same for the beef sausage.

720
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:23,685
75% lean pork too?

721
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,721
75% lean beef.

722
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:30,721
- It would make it a luxury food.
- When's this being promulgated?

723
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:37,042
Next month, probably. They'll deny it, probably
tell you they're just discussing changing its name.

724
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:40,882
- What is the government going to do?
- I just don't know.

725
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:43,845
It's a big problem.
I won't pretend we've got an answer.

726
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:48,000
Well, I must rush. Any more questions?

727
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,398
- When can we use this?
- Tomorrow, as far as I'm concerned.

728
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,845
Bernard will give you a drink
in the press office. Thanks for coming.

729
00:51:56,887 --> 00:52:00,880
You realise the press will be printing
something that isn't true?

730
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,446
Really?

731
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:05,124
How frightful!

732
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:12,403
<i>(RADl0) Today's story about the proposed</i>
<i>European ban on the British sausage</i>

733
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:15,127
<i>has caused a maj'or political storm.</i>

734
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:18,996
<i>Westminster sources say the sausage</i>
<i>could be another banana skin.</i>

735
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:22,398
<i>It adds to the government's problems</i>
<i>with the succession.</i>

736
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:27,277
<i>Members are troubled by the fact that</i>
<i>the two obvious candidates for the leadership</i>

737
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,245
<i>represent the extreme wings of the party.</i>

738
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:34,685
<i>Pressure is mounting for them to withdraw</i>
<i>in favour of a compromise candidate.</i>

739
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:39,363
<i>No other contender</i>
<i>seems to have caught the public imagination.</i>

740
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:42,166
- <i>Now sport...</i>
- Turn it off, Donald.

741
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:48,717
- Is it true about the compromise candidate?
- I believe so.

742
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:53,244
- Where DO they get their information?
- I can't imagine, Bernard!

743
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:56,604
Anyway, I never said compromise.
I said moderate.

744
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:02,682
Incidentally, why are BBC TV and ITN
covering your speech this evening?

745
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,838
I can't imagine, Bernard.

746
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:10,639
I know that fire and safety policy in government
buildings is awfully important, but...

747
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:15,164
Maybe someone suggested
I was going to raise other issues as well.

748
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:19,282
- Who?
- I can't imagine, Bernard.

749
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:26,279
I am a good European.
I believe in the European ideal.

750
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:31,282
Never again shall we repeat the bloodshed
of the two world wars.

751
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:34,007
Europe is here to stay.

752
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:39,241
But this does not mean that
we have to bow the knee to every directive

753
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:42,717
from every little bureaucratic Bonaparte
in Brussels.

754
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:47,324
We are a sovereign nation still.
We are British and proud of it!

755
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:55,484
We have made enough concessions
to the European Commissar for Agriculture.

756
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:59,196
When I say Commissar, I use the word advisedly.

757
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,643
We've swallowed the wine lake
and the butter mountain,

758
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:06,561
we've watched our French friends
beating up British lorry drivers

759
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,036
carrying British lamb to the French.

760
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:12,438
We have bowed and scraped, doffed our caps,

761
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:17,635
tugged our forelocks and turned the other cheek,
but I say enough is enough!

762
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:25,402
The Europeans have gone too far.
They are now threatening the British sausage.

763
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:31,358
They want to standardise it, by which they mean
they'll force us to eat salami and bratwurst

764
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:36,999
and other garlic-ridden greasy foods
that are totally alien to the British way of life.

765
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:41,285
Do you want salami for breakfast
with your egg and bacon? I don't! I won't!

766
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:49,003
They've turned our pints into litres
and our yards into metres.

767
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:53,399
We gave up the tanner, the threepenny bit,
the two-bob piece and the half crown,

768
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:57,276
but they cannot and WILL not
destroy the British sausage.

769
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,804
Not while I'm here!

770
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:09,600
In the words of Martin Luther, here I stand.
I can do no more.

771
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:18,802
- Strong stuff, Minister.
- I feel strongly about it.

772
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:23,802
I sometimes wonder whether you media people
realise how strongly we others feel

773
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:27,642
about Britain, about our country.
We love it and we're proud of it.

774
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,879
You're at odds with government policy
over the EEC?

775
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:34,357
I'm very happy with government policy,
Sir Ludovic.

776
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:40,284
Just a guess. But it's never been government
policy to abolish the British sausage.

777
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:44,565
Sausages are not only good to eat,
they're full of top-quality nourishment.

778
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:48,402
Brussels denies wanting
to abolish the British sausage.

779
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:53,277
They would. They know what they're up against.
They know the strength of British opinion.

780
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:56,644
Your speech got a lot of coverage
and a lot of praise.

781
00:55:56,807 --> 00:56:00,402
- Was there any significance in the timing?
- Sorry?

782
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:05,516
Your party is looking for a new leader
and your name's been mentioned a few times.

783
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:08,440
Oh. Quite a lot, I believe.

784
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,439
But no, I've no ambitions at all in that direction.

785
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:15,485
So you definitely won't let your name go forward?

786
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,962
Well, Ludo... All I've...

787
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:25,763
All I've ever wanted to do is serve my country.
I've never sought office.

788
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:30,955
But if my colleagues persuaded me the best
place to serve it from was 10 Downing Street,

789
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:35,837
I might perhaps reluctantly be persuaded
to undertake the responsibility

790
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,885
whatever my own private wishes might be.

791
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:42,403
If you're not in the running, who will you vote for?

792
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,276
Well, it's far too early to say. But I will say this.

793
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,802
This is a time for healing.

794
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:55,122
A time to stress what we agree about,
not what we disagree about.

795
00:56:55,287 --> 00:57:00,680
We should be looking for the good
in our opponents, not always looking for faults.

796
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:03,964
There's good in everyone, you know, Ludo.

797
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:07,926
- Except the French!
- Except...

798
00:57:12,047 --> 00:57:14,038
Even the French.

799
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:25,565
Minister, a message came from Central House
while you were in committee.

800
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,046
Yes?

801
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:30,995
- They brought the party meeting forward.
- Brought it forward?

802
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:36,924
The committee will decide if they're going to
bring up another candidate to oppose you.

803
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:43,276
- The Chief Whip will phone as soon as it's over.
- W-W-Will he... W-What will they... What if...

804
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:45,836
Which phone?

805
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,043
- What?
- Which phone will he ring on?

806
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:50,767
Oh. Er, this one, probably.

807
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,405
Or this one.

808
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,326
Either, really.

809
00:57:56,487 --> 00:58:00,446
If Duncan and Eric withdraw,
which they will, they might not support me.

810
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:05,078
- That means an election.
- You're the favourite candidate for both sides,

811
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,205
- so you'll be unopposed.
- That's what they say.

812
00:58:09,407 --> 00:58:12,160
Oh, well... No point in worrying about it.

813
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:17,282
- Might as well sit down and relax.

814
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:20,440
Yes?

815
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes.

816
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:26,966
Yes.

817
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,406
Yes.

818
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:33,081
Bernard has an urgent message.

819
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:36,605
Minister, the Palace have been on the phone.

820
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:40,999
- The Palace? Why?
- Will you be free to kiss hands at five o'clock?

821
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,886
In the event of an unopposed recommendation.

822
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:45,366
Well, I...

823
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:50,565
I think I might be able to make that.

824
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:02,364
Bernard...

825
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,041
Supposing... You know if I...

826
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,086
Er...

827
00:59:08,247 --> 00:59:11,000
I'd still want a Principal Private Secretary.

828
00:59:12,487 --> 00:59:15,365
- Do you think, er...
- Oh, Minister.

829
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:17,800
Gosh!

830
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:22,924
- That'll be all right, won't it, Humphrey?
- Well...

831
00:59:23,087 --> 00:59:25,442
The Prime Minister's word is law.

832
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,601
(PHONE RINGS)

833
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:34,206
Yes?

834
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,326
Yes.

835
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:39,766
Yes.

836
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:43,044
Yes, he's here.

837
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:47,164
I'll tell him.

838
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:50,487
It... It... It... Is...

839
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,603
Is it me?

840
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:56,076
Yes, Prime Minister!
