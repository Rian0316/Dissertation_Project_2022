1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,020

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,000

3
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:32,000

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
无功受禄

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,790
办公设施方面真的不能削减开支了?
We can't economise in accommodation?

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,076
恐怕不能 大臣
'Fraid not, Minister.

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,392
信息处理设备方面呢?      不可能 到底了
Data-processing equipment? Not possible.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,951
成人教育预算?      很不幸 没法削减
The further education budget? Sadly, it can't be.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,710
好吧 至少本科教育开支有所减少
At least the universities won't cost us as much,

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,759
外国学生学费抵了教育开支
with overseas students paying fees covering education costs.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,675
除非您批准例外提案...      不 很抱歉 绝无例外
Unless you make exceptions...? No, sorry, no exceptions.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,751
至少这方面还能省
At least, that's one saving.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,595
大臣 已经…      哦 当然
Minister, it's... Yes, of course.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,354
恐怕就到这里了 散会
That's all, I'm afraid. Meeting over.

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,158
多谢      谢谢
Thank you Thank you.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,951
大臣 在汉弗莱爵士来之前
Before Sir Humphrey comes,

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,830
首相府授勋秘书要您批准部门授勋名单
Number 10 asked you to approve recommendations for the honours list.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,434
伯纳 你问了八遍了
That's the eighth time you've asked.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,831
难道授勋就是部里的头等大事吗?
Are honours the most serious concern of this department?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,710
是的 榜上有名的人整天守着电话 有的三天没合眼了
They are to the people on the list. Some haven't slept fordays.

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,112
急什么急? 大臣几时否决过文官受勋?
What are they worried about? Ministers never veto honours.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,875
几乎没有 但理论上有可能 越拖他们越心慌
It's possible. They're worried about the delay.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,033
他们怎么知道的? 文件上写着"绝密"
How do people know they're listed? Its marked "Strictly Confidential"

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,952
哦 大臣
Oh, Minister...

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,358
是我犯傻
Silly of me.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,479
真希望他们能花四分之一的精力削减开支
If they'd put some of that effort into cutting expenditure...

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,757
怎么才能让人们对节约
How can I make people want economies

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,515
像对帝国勋章 大巴思勋章一样热心呢?
in the same way they want OBEs and KCBs?

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,195
我觉得... 不 不 不...
I've been thinking... No, no, no.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,999
什么?      不 不 没事
What? No, no, nothing...

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,119
来吧 伯纳 说出来
Spit it out.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,236
我没资格...我不提倡 也不支持 但是
It's not my place, and I couldn't possibly recommend it...

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,518
如果您不批准公务员授勋
Suppose you were to refuse to recommend any honours

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,674
除非他们削减预算5%如何?
for civil servants who hadn't cut their budgets by 5 %?

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,678
伯纳      对不起 大臣 我…
Bernard! Sorry, Minister...

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,957
不 伯纳 这太妙了
No, Bernard! It's brilliant!

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,876
好主意 公务员就这一个死穴 对吗?
It's the answer. It's the only hold we have over the civil servants.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,510
我管不了他们加薪 或者晋升
I can't stop their pay rises or their promotions.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,196
不写他们的工作报告 但我可以不给他们授勋
I don't even write their reports, but I can with hold their honours!

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,636
干得好 伯纳      是您自己想到的 大臣
Well done. You thought of it, Minister.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,032
不 不 是你想出来的      不 是您想出来的
No, no, you thought of it. No, you thought of it.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,069
求您
Please!

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,839
请少加点 谢谢
Just a touch, please. Thank you very much.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,913
真是丰盛的晚餐 院长 我一向乐意叨扰府上
Splendid dinner. I always enjoy my visits here.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,311
今后怕是来不了喽 汉弗莱
I'm afraid this could be your last.

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,268
怎么?我把酒传错方向了吗?
Why? Did I pass the port the wrong way?

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,274
告诉他吧 财务处长      贝利学院快破产了
Tell him, Bursar. The college's going to the wall.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,878
多亏你们部的新政 对外国学生收全额学费
It's your new policy of charging overseas students full rates.

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,349
牛津大多数学院还能应付
Other Oxford colleges can cope,

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,275
但是贝利的外国学生向来是最多的
but we've always had many overseas students here at Baillie.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,989
对 可是全额就全额 有什么关系
You simply charge them a full fee, no problem.

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,073
可他们付不起 四千磅一年? 没人肯来
Unless they can't pay ?,000 a year. They won't come.

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,554
我跑遍世界 甚至到美国筹款 兜售牛津教育理念
I've been all over the USA selling them the idea of an Oxford education

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,632
非洲满是英国教授
Africa is crawling with British professors

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,430
拼命要把社会学课程塞给当地人
frantically trying to flog sociology courses to the natives.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,832
在印度和中东 也是你死我活
And India and the Middle East. Competition is cut-throat.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,595
何不改招英国本国学生?
Why not fill up vacancies with British undergraduates?

58
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,631
一点都不好笑 汉弗莱
I don't think that's awfully funny, Humphrey.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,788
我没说笑话      老伙计 怎么能招本国学生
I wasn't trying to be funny. Anything but home students!

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,318
为什么?      一名英国学生只能收500磅
Why? We only get 500 a head forthem.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,235
400人才抵得上50个外国学生
We'd have to take 400 to replace a mere 50 foreigners.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,871
师生比例会从1:10变成1:34
The staff/student ratio would go from 1:10 to 1:34.

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,319
教室和寝室会挤得像沃伍德监狱
We'd have classrooms, dormitories... like Wormwood Scrubs!

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,873
或者像苏塞克斯大学
Or the University of Sussex!

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,999
院长估计这些画能卖两三万磅
The Master thinks the pictures mayfetch ?030,000.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,469
画加上银器
The pictures and silver together

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,030
刚够新教学楼的贷款利息
might just pay the mortgage interest.

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,794
天啊 天啊
Dear, oh, dear!

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,476
当然 也可以让政府对我们网开一面
Orwe could get the Government to treat us as an exception.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,313
有趣的是 汉弗莱
Interestingly, Humphrey,

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,634
这个权利似乎在你的大臣手上
it seems to be your Minister who has the authority.

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,033
怎样才能说服大臣认同贝利学院的重要性呢?
Howmight one persuade aMinister of the importance of Baillie College?

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,318
我不知道 不如请他来出席贵宾晚宴?
Why not get him down to a High Table dinner?

74
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,429
以他的智商能理解我们的状况吗?
Is he of the intellectual calibre to understand our case?

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,550
可以吧
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,271
这么简单的状况
It's intelligible to anyone

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,557
连维尼熊都能理解
with the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh!

78
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,517
就是
Quite!

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,674
哈克的智商能比上维尼熊?
And Hacker is of the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh?

80
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,917
哦 可以的
Oh, yes!

81
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,831
状态好的话
On his day.

82
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,389
早安 大臣      早安 汉弗莱
Morning, Minister. Morning, Humphrey.

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,357
有两件事 大臣
Two things, Minister.

84
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,958
首先 部里推荐的授勋名单
Firstly, the departmental recommendations for the honours list.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,317
又是授勋名单      是的 大臣
The honours list again! Yes, Minister.

86
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,076
先放一放好吧?      不能放 大臣
Let's leave that for the moment. We can't leave it, Minister.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,550
快到5星期期限了      5星期?
It's getting nearthe five weeks. Five weeks?

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,678
对 凡授勋都要提前5星期通知
All recipients are notified five weeks before.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,910
好让他们有时间拒绝
It gives them time to refuse.

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,675
几时有公务员拒绝过授勋?
When did a civil servant last refuse an honour?

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,593
应该是财政部那位 拒绝骑士头衔
Somebody in the Treasury refused a knigh thood.

92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,196
天啊 哪年?      似乎是1496年
When? I think itwas 1496.

93
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,957
为什么?      他有一个了
Why? He'd already got one.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,351
大臣 如果您已经批准...      汉弗莱
Lf you've approved the list... Humphrey...

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,830
你知不知道20%勋位都授给了公务员?
Did you know that 20 % of honours go to civil servants?

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,798
这是对他们勤奋工作的适当奖赏 大臣
Afitting tribute to their devotion to duty.

97
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,030
不 他们已经拿薪水了
That's what they get paid for.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,079
我们这些人得有特殊贡献才能得荣誉
The rest of us have to do something special to get an honour.

99
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,109
为弱智儿童工作20年才换一枚帝国勋章
They work for years with the mentally handicapped to get an MBE.

100
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,511
而你们的骑士头衔水到渠成
Your knigh thoods simply come up with the rations.

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,514
大臣 女皇陛下的公务员们一辈子
Minister, her Majesty's civil servants spend their lives

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,151
领取微薄薪水 最终默默无闻地退休
working for a modest wage and at the end retire in to obscurity.

103
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,239
荣誉只能稍微告慰他们为国家
Honours are a small reward for a lifetime of loyal,

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,633
和女王忠贞不渝 鞠躬尽瘁的一生
self-effacing discretion and devoted service to the nation.

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,155
微薄薪水?      唉 是的
"A modest wage"? Alas, yes.

106
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,630
汉弗莱 你一年的薪水超过三万镑
You get over?0,000 a year!

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,476
比我还多七千英镑      对 可是相比之下仍算微薄
That's ?,000 more than I get. But still relatively modest.

108
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,713
跟谁比?
Relative to whom?

109
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,075
像伊丽莎白・泰勒
Elizabeth Taylor, for example.

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,440
汉弗莱 你和伊丽莎白・泰勒毫无可比性
You are not relative to Elizabeth Taylor.

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,190
你们俩截然不同
There are important differences.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,837
可不是 她又没在牛津拿过第一
Indeed, yes. She didn't get a first at Oxford.

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,556
你也不会默默无闻退休
And retire into obscurity?

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,840
你拿大笔养老金 去石油公司和银行做董事
You take a massive pension and become directors of oil companies.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,036
那也是默默无闻的董事
But very obscure directors.

116
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,512
还没有炒鱿鱼之忧 干工业的 犯错误你会被解雇
You're in no dangerof the sack. In industry, you get the boot.

117
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,717
做公务员 你犯错误 我被解雇
In the civil service, if you screw up, I get the boot!

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,675
很好笑 大臣 那份名单...      不行 汉弗莱
Very droll, Minister. The list... No, Humphrey.

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,197
我不会白批 公务员得自己挣来荣誉
I'll not approve any honour to any civil servant who hasn't earned it.

120
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,396
您说什么"挣来"?      挣来就是挣来
What do you mean, "earned it"? I mean "earned it".

121
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,838
无功不受禄      这种事闻所未闻
Done something to deserve it. But that's unheard of!

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,948
我的新政要求部里所有公务员每年
My new policy is to withhold all honours from civil servants

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,033
削减预算5% 否则不给授勋
who do not make a cut in their budgets of 5 % per year.

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,909
你是不是默许啦?
Your silence indicates approval?

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,039
绝不是 您哪来这么荒谬的想法?
It does not! Where did you get that preposterous idea?

126
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,193
是...
It...

127
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,474
我突然想到的      荒唐透顶 闻所未闻 不可能
...just came to me. It's ridiculous! Unheard of!

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,200
怎么?      这整个想法就...
The whole idea is... It's...

129
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,397
它从根本上危及...
It strikes at the very roots of...

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,154
它是灭亡的前兆
It's the beginning of the end!

131
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,437
是导火索 是左翼激进主义
The thin end of the wedge! A Bennite solution!

132
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,314
然后呢? 您要废除君主制吗?
What next? Abolition of the monarchy?

133
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,118
别发傻 汉弗莱
Don't be absurd.

134
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,556
这个体系一直完美运转 无需改变
The system has worked so well in the past.

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,039
它不完美
It hasn't.

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,432
我们得公平审视这一体制      就知道你会说
Give it a fairtrial. I thought you might say that...

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,358
告诉你 嘉德勋章由爱德华三世设立于1348年
The Most Noble Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 by Edward III.

138
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,432
审判期该结束了吧?
It's at the end of its trial period now.

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,355
大臣 一旦您借经济阻碍荣誉
Minister, if you block honours pending economies,

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,478
您可能开创一个危险的先例
you might create a dangerous precedent.

141
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,151
你是说这次我们做对了
If we do the right thing now,

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,312
下次也非对不可?
we'll have to do the right thing next time?

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,711
天哪汉弗莱 什么都别干才是正理么      恰恰相反
Nothing would get done at all! On the contrary.

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,078
有很多事应该做 可是      不要做第一个
Many things must be done, but... Nothing done for the first time.

145
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,559
不 大臣
No, Minister!

146
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,511
我完全支持您的意图 我会全力予以贯彻
I'm fully seized of your aims, and I'll try to put them into practice.

147
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,999
为此目的
To that end,

148
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,312
我提议设立各部联席委员会广泛调查
I recommend we set up a committee with broad terms of reference,

149
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,314
以便最终考虑到一切后果
so we're in a position to think through the various implications

150
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,631
并从长远考虑角度出发作出决定
and decide based on long-term considerations

151
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,271
而不是仓促采取轻率 考虑欠周的行动
rather than rush prematurely into precipitate and ill-conceived actions

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,830
从而造成无法预料的后果
which might have unforeseen repercussions.

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,399
你是说"不行"?
You mean "no"?

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,395
我是说 就目前看来 等时机成熟…
I mean, as faras one can see, in the fullness of time...

155
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,233
不 不 不 汉弗莱
No, no, no, Humphrey.

156
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,550
你了解我 雷厉风行
You know me: Action now!

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,392
雷厉风行
Action now.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,472
神志健全的人都不想被授勋
Nobody in their right mind can want honours.

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,757
授勋引起奉承 势利 嫉妒
They encourage sycophancy, snobbery, jealousy,

160
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,718
这些都归公务员可不公平
and civil servants shouldn't get them all!

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,557
可是大臣...      不 汉弗莱 抱歉 我主意已定
But Minister... No, no! I'm sorry. I have decided.

162
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,553
还有一件呢?      还有一件?
Your other point? Other point?

163
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,553
你说有两件事的      是吗?
You had two. Did I?

164
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,315
是的 抱歉 气糊涂了
Yes, I'm sorry. The shock!

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,677
大臣 昨天我会见了牛津贝利学院的代表
Yesterday, I had representations from Baillie College, Oxford.

166
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,312
照外国学生学费的新规定 他们一年损失二十五万
Grants for overseas students... They'll lose millions a year.

167
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,278
多招英国学生不就完了
They must just take more British students.

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,554
他们当然极其乐意 大臣 但是
Nothing would please them more, but you see...

169
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,598
贝利学院的外国学生最多
Baillie has many foreign students,

170
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,830
新政会严重打击
and there could be repercussions

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,470
热带病学系和国际公法系
at the schools of tropical medicine, international law,

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,757
阿拉伯语系甚至得停办
and the Arabic department may have to close down.

173
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,515
对不起 我不能花纳税人的钱去教育外国人
We can't educate foreigners at the taxpayer's expense.

174
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,432
不单单是外国人 大臣
Not just foreigners.

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,038
如果外交部没地方给新人员培训阿拉伯文化
If the diplomatic service had nowhere to immerse its recruits,

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,035
后果不堪设想 甚至会有亲以色列的外交部
the results could be catastrophic, with a pro-Israeli Foreign Office!

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
石油政策会变成什么样?
What would happen to our oil policy?

178
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,239
那么只能换个地方培训
Its recruits must go elsewhere.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,834
还有哪能学习阿拉伯语?
Where else would they learn Arabic?

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,036
阿拉伯?
Arabia?

181
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,873
事实上 大臣 贝利学院确有过人之处
Baillie College has an outstanding record.

182
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,589
多年来 它使英国监狱人满为患      监狱?
It's filled our jails for years. Jails?

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,594
是的 您看 字母JB代表英联邦最高荣誉
Yes. The letters "JB" are the finest honour in the Commonwealth.

184
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,355
"JB"?      "英国犯人"
"JB"? "Jailed by the British".

185
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,432
甘地(印度) 恩克鲁玛(加纳) 马卡李奥(塞浦路斯)
Gandhi, Nkrumah, Makarios,

186
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
本-古理安(以色列) 肯雅塔(肯尼亚)
Ben-Gurion, Kenyatta,

187
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
尼赫鲁(印度) 穆加贝(津巴布韦)
Nehru, Mugabe.

188
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,834
各国领导人 无穷无尽 很有几名我们的校友
The list of leaders is endless and contains several of ourstudents.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,956
"我们的校友"?
"Ourstudents"?

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,032
汉弗莱 你上的哪所学院?
Humphrey... which college did you go to?

191
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,709
大臣 这完全是题外话
That is quite beside the point.

192
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,075
我就喜欢聊题外话
I like being beside the point.

193
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,555
说来听听 汉弗莱 你上的哪所学院?
Humourme, Humphrey. Which college did you go to?

194
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,792
该不会刚好是贝利学院吧?
Was it Baillie, by any strange coincidence?

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,797
恰巧...我也是贝利人
It so happens... I am a Baillie man,

196
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,155
但这完全是两码事
but that has nothing to do with it!

197
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,151
对对对 两码事嘛
No, of course not.

198
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,550
想什么呢 不害臊
Perish the thought. Naughty.

199
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,715
喂? 下院分组表决 大臣
Yes? The division, Minister.

200
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,190
就这么定了吧 汉弗莱 没时间了
That rathersettles it. No more time.

201
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,828
伯纳 我该投赞成还是反对?
Am I voting "aye" or"no"?

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,276
投反对 反对党的修正案 第二读...     管它是什么
"No". It's a... I don't want to know what it is.

203
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,318
我只怕走错门而已
I don't want to go through the wrong door.

204
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,795
阿诺德?
Arnold?

205
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,754
汉弗莱 请坐
Humphrey! Do sit down.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,958
希望你不介意来一趟内阁办公室
Hope you don't mind my dragging you here.

207
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,750
哦 没关系      我有点担心你的大臣
No, please. I was worried about your Minister.

208
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,233
"将勋章跟节约挂钩"
Linking honours to economies.

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,914
哦 您听说了? 纯粹胡说八道
That? A lot of nonsense.

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,548
很好 你是说没那回事
Good. You mean it's not true?

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,713
不完全...他确实是提到了
Not exactly. That is, he did just mention it.

212
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,194
但是...      但是什么?
But... But what?

213
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,835
我找不到有效论据来反驳他
I can't find any effective arguments against it.

214
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,553
汉弗莱 这可是导火索      我说了
It's the thin end of the wedge. That's what I said.

215
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,836
是左翼激进主义      我也说了
A Bennite solution. I said that.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,833
后果不堪设想      我都说了
Where will it end? That's what I said.

217
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,469
确实无法容忍 但是...
No, it's intolerable, but...

218
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,712
又不可违抗
irresistible.

219
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,158
是啊 我不是指摘你 我也不了解内情
I'm not reprimanding you, I don't know the facts well enough.

220
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,711
但作为秘书长 我希望你保证他不会实施
I'd like your assurance that he won't be putting it into practice.

221
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,950
我当然希望不会
I certainly hope he won't.

222
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,237
"希望"恐怕不够
I'm not sure that hopes are good enough.

223
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,155
试想一旦你们部门实施 很快就会在政府扩散
Lfhe applied it to your department, the contagion would spread!

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,038
每一个部门
Every department!

225
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,719
那么 我们可以指望你咯?      我会尽力
Presumably, we can count on you? I shall certainly try.

226
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,270
但这...很棘手      你当然有你的办法
But... it's rathertricky. You know what you're doing.

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,035
但这可能让大家怀疑你是否可靠
This could cause people to reflect on your soundness.

228
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,358
当然我本人毫不怀疑 但是...
I've no doubts about you myself, but...

229
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,036
谈个心总是好的      当然 谢谢 阿诺德
I thought a chatwould be useful. Absolutely. Thank you.

230
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,398
对了 我刚刚跟我们学院的院长通了电话
By the way, I had our college master on the phone.

231
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,552
他说你上周在贝利参加了晚宴      是啊
He said you dined at Baillie. Right!

232
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,830
我保证你的大臣会给他们特殊待遇 对吧?
I assured them your Minister would treat them as a special case.

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,551
当然 当然
Yes... Yes...

234
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,439
我已经安排大臣参加贵宾宴会
I've got the Minister coming to a benefactors' dinner.

235
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,955
很好 你果然可靠
Good. Sound man.

236
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,875
好了 我得去10号了 感谢你过来 汉弗莱
I must be getting over to Number 10. Thanks for dropping in.

237
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,359
不胜荣幸
Pleasure...

238
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,111
阿诺德
Arnold.

239
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,589
据说汉弗莱爵士昨天
Sir Humphrey saw the Cabinet Secretary

240
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,035
被内阁秘书狠批一番      真的?
and got the most frightful wigging.

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,115
对 骂得他狗血淋头 为您的"按节约授勋"妙计
Really tore him off a strip because of your economie-honour scheme

242
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,558
是你的妙计 伯纳      我们商量好的
Your scheme. We've been through all that.

243
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,109
对 抱歉 我的妙计
Sorry. My scheme.

244
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,753
汉弗莱这种高级官员也会挨训吗?
Why wig someone as high up as Humphrey?

245
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,595
通常是很客气的 但这次显然已经无所顾忌了
Normally, it's civilised, but this time itwas no-holds-barred.

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,309
阿诺德爵士说不是故意要指摘他
SirArnold said he wasn't actually reprimanding him.

247
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,755
这么惨?      是啊
Bad as that, was it? Yes.

248
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,228
还暗示有人怀疑他的可靠程度
He suggested some people might not think he was sound.

249
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,835
大打出手啊      确实
A real punch-up! Indeed.

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,437
阿诺德爵士担心什么?他能拿的都拿了吧?
What has Sir Arnold to fear? He has all the honours he could want.

251
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,034
他才到G      G?
He has his "G". "G"?

252
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,034
先拿K 然后拿G      别打谜语 伯纳
You get your "G" after your "K". You speak in riddles.

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,432
先拿CMG 然后拿KCMG 最后拿GCMG
First you get the CMG, then the KCMG and the GCMG,

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,115
三等勋爵士 二等勋爵士
the Command of the Order of St Michael and St George,

255
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,555
大十字勋爵士
Knight Grand Cross of St George.

256
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,157
在部门里 CMG代表"叫我上帝"
In the service, CMG stands for "Call Me God".

257
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,108
而KCMG代表"请叫我上帝"
And KCMG for "Kindly Call Me God".

258
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,198
GCMG怎么讲?
And GCMG?

259
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,918
"上帝叫我上帝"
"God Calls Me God".

260
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,433
阿诺德爵士担心什么?他不是都拿遍了吗?
Why should SirArnold worry? He has his full quota of honours.

261
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,919
没有 差得远呢
Nowhere near!

262
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,070
还有贵族爵位 功绩勋章 荣誉三等男爵士勋章
There's a peerage, the CH

263
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,470
嘉德勋章 蓟花骑士勋章...
the OM, the Knight of the Thistle...

264
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,915
蓟花骑士? 发给谁的?
Knight of the Thistle? Who for?

265
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,517
苏格兰人和驴子?      二者有区别的 大臣
Scotsmen and donkeys? There's a distinction.

266
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,797
你是没碰到苏格兰民族主义分子
You haven't met the Scottish Nationalists!

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,274
谁管蓟花?      有个委员会就吃它了
How do they award the Thistle? A committee sits on it.

268
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,116
汉弗莱真以为我会改变大学财务政策
Does Humphrey think I'll change university policy

269
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,191
就为一个贵宾宴会?
over High Table dinner?

270
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,353
我听说贝利的宴会极为丰盛 大臣
I believe Baillie College give a very good dinner, Minister.

271
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,795
还有多远?      几分钟 40号高速很好走
How much further? A few minutes. The M40's good.

272
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,274
4号高速也不错
So's the M4...

273
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,989
为什么有两条这么好的路直通牛津
Why did we get two really good roads to Oxford

274
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,996
却没有一条通南安普敦或多佛 或者别的港口?
before any to Southampton or Dover or any of the ports?

275
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,199
几乎全体常任秘书都出身牛津 大臣
Nearly all our Permanent Secretaries went to Oxford, Minister,

276
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,399
牛津各学院都有很好的晚宴
and most Oxford colleges give very good dinners.

277
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,158
内阁纵容他们?      当然不 他们坚决反对
The Cabinet allow that? Certainly not.

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,710
他们禁止修路让文官们去牛津赴宴
They said no motorway to take civil servants to Oxford,

279
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,429
除非先修路让大臣们去乡下打猎
unless there was one to take Ministers hunting in the shires.

280
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,956
所以50年代的1号公路通往莱斯特乡间
That's why the M1 stopped in Leicestershire!

281
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,518
哦 少来了
Oh, come!

282
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,156
那刚完工的11号高速呢?
What about the M11 just completed?

283
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,834
剑桥各学院就不大宴宾客吗?
Doesn't Cambridge give as good dinners?

284
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,560
当然有 大臣 不过交通部
Yes, of course, but it's been years

285
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,599
多年没有剑桥出身的常任秘书了
since Transport had a Permanent Secretary from Cambridge.

286
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,913
作为快破产的的学院来说 晚宴不错嘛
Fora college on the edge ofbankruptcy, not a bad dinner!

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,436
菲兹沃晚宴由一笔特定基金支付
The Fitzwalter Dinner is paid forby endowment,

288
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,398
来自16世纪一位慷慨的赞助人
a great 16th-century benefactor.

289
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,588
平常我们只吃方便面拌腐乳
Most nights we eat Mother's Pride and processed cheese.

290
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,116
你们得找个20世纪的赞助人
You need a 20th-century benefactor.

291
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,512
您正好说到点子上      怎么了?
Interesting you should say that. Why?

292
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,240
赞助人数量稀少 相隔久远
Benefactors are few and farbetween.

293
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,076
艾萨克・沃尔森只是有史以来第二个被牛津
Isaac Wolfson is the second man to have a college named after him

294
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,800
和剑桥拿来命名学院的人      谁是第一个?
at Oxford and Cambridge. Who's the first?

295
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,279
耶稣
Jesus.

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,275
耶稣?      耶稣...基督
Jesus? Jesus... Christ.

297
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,239
我们最尊崇的那些赞助人
Some of ourmost revered benefactors are men

298
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,676
都曾拯救学院免遭政府掠夺
who saved the college from the depredations of Government.

299
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,594
他们的名字被顶礼膜拜几个世纪
Their names are remembered and hallowed for centuries.

300
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,355
也算是种不朽      真的?
It's a sort of immortality. Really?

301
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,273
说说看 这些赞助人做过什么?
What did these benefactors do?

302
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,070
就说威廉・德・维尔爵士 他的纹章和大名刻在教堂里
Take Sir William de Vere, his coat of arms are there and in chapel.

303
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,711
他在15世纪从贝利撤走了一支军队
He diverted the baronial army away from Baillie in the 15th century.

304
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,839
转而驻扎到了圣乔治学院
He had the soldiers billetted at St George's College.

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,752
我不知道还有圣乔治学院呢
I didn't know there was a St George's.

306
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,036
没有 从那之后就没有了
There isn't. Not since that.

307
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,914
再说乔治・蒙克顿
Then, there's George Monkton,

308
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,878
蒙克顿学院就是以他命名的
whom Monkton Quad's named after.

309
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,238
他阻止了克伦威尔融化全校银器
He stopped Cromwell melting all the college silverdown

310
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,152
来抵他新模范军的粮饷
to pay for his army.

311
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,229
他告诉他们 剑桥大学圣三一学院的银器要好得多
He told them the silverwas better quality at Trinity, Cambridge!

312
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,591
今后恐怕都没有学院可凭吊了
Now, it looks like there'll be no college left to remember.

313
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,471
当然 除非解决外国学生的问题
Unless we can solve the problem of overseas students.

314
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,995
当然 人总是愿意
Well, of course, one would like to...

315
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,718
自得其乐的...
help oneself.

316
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,838
呃...帮助他人
Er... help one's friends.

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,468
帮助学院
Help the college.

318
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,474
这与荣誉无关      当然 有此一念天理不容
Nothing to do with the honour. Of course not! Ignoble thought.

319
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,633
大臣坚信政治家的天职就是帮助他人
The Minister believes it's a politician's duty to help others.

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,439
完全正确 一语中的
Absolutely. Name of the game.

321
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,513
这才是搞政治的原因 帮助别人
That's why we go into politics, to help others.

322
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,751
我是个理想主义者 不为名不为利
I'm an idealist, nothing to do with the honour.

323
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,310
就我所见 荣誉都是身后之事
Most of the honour comes after you're dead.

324
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,393
可是等你入了土 你的名字铭刻在银烛台上
Not much satisfaction from having your name on the silversconce

325
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,632
也没多大意义了
when you're six feet under!

326
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,431
顺便 院长 说点别的
Incidentally, Master, to change the subject completely...

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,792
什么时候颁发荣誉博士学位?
when do you award your honorary doctorates?

328
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,192
颁证仪式还得几个月 但人选要在两周之内决定
The ceremonys not fora few month butwe have to decide in two weeks

329
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,079
荣誉博士?      人选还没定?
Doctorate? Aren't they decided?

330
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,391
还有个法学名誉博士空缺
There is one Doctorate of Law still to be decided.

331
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,270
不知该给一位法官呢 还是政府官员
We're wondering whether it should go to a judge or in Government

332
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,908
法官?
Judge?

333
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,758
才不用给法官颁法学博士呢
You don't want to make a judge a Doctor of Law!

334
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,708
是政治家制定法律 实施法律
The politicians make the laws and pass the laws.

335
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,112
没有政治家 法官们根本没法审判
If it wasn't for politicians, the judges wouldn't be able to judge.

336
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,317
无法可依 懂我意思吧?
There'd be no laws to judge!

337
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,357
当然当然      完全理解
Yes, indeed. Quite!

338
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,195
他们会无事可做 失业法官排成排
They'd have nothing to do. Queues of unemployed judges...

339
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,634
扣着可笑的假发
in silly wigs!

340
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,230
法官多好过
It's all right for judges.

341
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,190
他们不必讨好电视制片人 对记者撒谎
They don't have to suck up to TV producers, lie to journalists.

342
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,148
也不用假装喜欢内阁那些同僚
They don't have to pretend to like their Cabinet colleagues.

343
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,436
不然呢...我跟你们说...
I'll tell you something else...

344
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,710
要是法官得忍受我那些内阁同僚
if judges had to put up with some of my colleagues,

345
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,589
他们明天就会恢复死刑
they'd bring capital punishment back tomorrow!

346
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,118
恢复了正好
Bloody good job, too!

347
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,714
还有件事我得说
I'll tell you anotherthing...

348
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,236
我没法把他关进大牢
I can't send him to prison.

349
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,035
没法把他关进大牢
Can't send him to prison.

350
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,830
我要是法官 先把小汉关起来再说
If I were a judge, I could whiz old Humpy off to the Scrubs.

351
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,396
脚不落地 拖着就走 手铐咣的一声 三年后见
Feetwouldn't touch. Clang bang! See you in three years.

352
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,313
若诚心悔过 减刑三分之一
One third remission forgood conduct.

353
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,311
我整不了他
I can't do that!

354
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,276
还非得听他的话
I have to listen to him.

355
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,159
哦 老天
Oh, God!

356
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,758
他就念叨念叨念叨念叨
On and on and on!

357
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,038
有些句子比杰弗里大法官还要长
Some of his sentences are longer than Judge Jeffreys'!

358
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,555
不不不 政治家更该受奖赏
No, no, no. Politicians are much more deserving.

359
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,030
你们可不能给法官荣誉学位
You don't want to give your doctory honourates to judges.

360
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,713
千万不能
Definitely not!

361
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,717
至理名言啊 大臣
Beautifully argued, Minister.

362
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,919
我想通了 是不应该给法官
I see now... we shouldn't give it to a judge.

363
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,592
您方才讲得无比专业      简直如同法学博士 大臣
You put the case most expertly. Almost like a Doctor of Law.

364
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,309
我此时仿佛看到 您站在谢尔登礼堂里
I can see you there now in the Sheldonian,

365
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,517
绯红长袍加身 风华绝代
standing there in those magnificent crimson robes,

366
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,549
在诸位学术英杰面前接受博士学位
receiving doctorate in front of an assembly of eminent scholars.

367
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,234
太好了      棒极了
Wonderful. Marvellous.

368
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,472
你会说到这个 真有意思
How funny you should say that.

369
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,950
我刚巧也想着同样的场面呢
I was just thinking the same thing.

370
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,713
早安 大臣 早安 伯纳
Morning, Minister. Morning, Bernard.

371
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,431
昨天的晚宴真愉快 大臣
Most enjoyable dinner last night.

372
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,037
会议之前我想和您私下聊几句 抱歉 伯纳
I wonder if we could have a private chat. Forgive us, Bernard.

373
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,359
大臣
Minister...

374
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,709
贝利学院的院长让我问您
The master of Baillie has asked me to enquire

375
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,873
您是否有兴趣接受牛津荣誉法学博士学位
whether you'd accept an honorary doctorate of law.

376
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,398
我? 天哪
Me? Good heavens!

377
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,597
当然 这并不是收买您      当然不是
It's... not an offer. No, of course not.

378
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,912
自然 众所周知 您反感勋位
Of course, in view of your well-known hostility to honours...

379
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,799
别犯傻 汉弗莱 这是两码事
Don't be silly. This is quite different.

380
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,311
不完全是 大臣
Not entirely, Minister.

381
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,474
要知道 您这可是无功受禄 不是"挣来"的
It's a matter of accepting it without doing anything to deserve it,

382
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,553
正如您自己会直言不讳的那样
as you might put it in your refreshingly blunt fashion.

383
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,996
我是内阁大臣
I'm a Cabinet Minister!

384
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,748
您不是领薪水了吗?      对 可...不是
Isn't that what you're paid for? Yes, but... No!

385
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,953
对 可是...
Yes, but...

386
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,035
那是政府秘密投票 我又没法拒绝      当然当然
I cant refuse avote of confidence in the Government, not just oneself.

387
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,829
没错 但我说过 事还没定 这个...
No, quite. As I say, it's not certain, it's...

388
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,038
汉弗莱 还有件事      什么 大臣?
Humphrey, to change the subject completely,

389
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,751
我愿尽力帮助贝利学院 解决外国学生问题
Id like to do what I can for Baillie in overseas students business

390
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,512
哦 太好了
Oh, good!

391
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,116
但我的借口...理由呢?
Butwouldn't I need a pretext... a reason?

392
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,191
不必 大臣 没有问题
No, Minister, no problem.

393
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,319
据我所知 皇室正受到某些非洲领导人的压力
The Palace has been under pressure from certain African leaders.

394
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,550
自然不能让皇室为难
We can't embarrass the Palace,

395
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,111
因此可以重新指定贝利学院为英联邦教育中心
so we'll redesignate Baillie as a Commonwealth Education Centre.

396
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,513
可经费从哪来? 我要求各方面都削减5%预算
But where am I to find the money? Im set on 5% cuts across the board

397
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,151
如果这里开口 那就刹不住了
If that's achieved, anything's possible.

398
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,029
大臣 经费调查委员会来了      好的伯纳 带他们进来
The committee are waiting. Very well, show them in.

399
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,751
大臣 照我说 本部门还是能节约的
I suppose we could achieve the cuts in this department,

400
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,074
只要不把它联系到勋章就行了
if the absurd idea of linking honours to cuts were to be shelved.

401
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,674
我明白了      好的
I see. Yes...

402
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,755
谢谢 伯纳      早安
Thank you, Bernard. Morning.

403
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,071
首先回顾上次会议内容      好的
Now, minutes of the previous meeting?

404
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,712
好 上次议程包括 办公设施
Matters arising: Accommodation.

405
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,518
哦 对了
Oh, yes!

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,037
很高兴告诉大家 我们能削减5%经费
I'm happy to be able to tell you that we have found a 5 % cut,

407
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,629
只要出售海威库姆那幢老办公楼
by selling an office in High Wycombe.

408
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,631
哦 真的?      没错
Oh, really? Yes.

409
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,836
不错 太好了      是啊
Yes, very good. Yes.

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,399
文具购置呢?
Stationery acquisition?

411
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,315
是的 我们有种新的盘货制度 能减少年度支出
We've discovered a new stock control system to reduce expenditure.

412
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,870
减多少?      大约5% 对吗?
By howmuch? About 5 %, wasn't it?

413
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,273
太好了 园林管理方面呢?
Excellent! Parks and Forestry?

414
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,519
只要推迟购置新计算机 就能省下一笔
If we delay the new computers, we can make a saving.

415
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,557
是吗?能省多少?      是啊 多少?
