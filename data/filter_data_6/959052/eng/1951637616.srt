00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,309
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,105
<i>The scavos prepared
for a grand opening...</i>

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,507
This could be
the best thing

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:09,255
That's ever happened
to our family.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,296
<i>While gabrielle had
a few too many drinks...</i>

6
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:13,015
I'm gonna take
a little nap, okay?

7
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:18,048
<i>And a cry for help
made orson lose his cool.</i>

8
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:20,339
Suicide is the worst thing
that could happen to a family!

9
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,862
<i>Mike got arrested...</i>

10
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,027
Oh, thank god.

11
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,094
<i>And a friendship
hit the rocks.</i>

12
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:27,353
For the sake
of our friendship--
Make no mistake,

13
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,611
Our friendship is over.

14
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,679
<i>Orson's mom was determined...</i>

15
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,967
<i>In the eyes of god,
you're the other woman.</i>

16
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,029
<i>To bring alma and orson
back together.</i>

17
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:41,899
(Bree) she raped you,
and your mother helped.
I think it's time

18
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,573
I told you about the night
about monique died.

19
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,158
<i>Alma became a prisoner...</i>

20
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,180
Gloria?!

21
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:48,776
<i>Bree...</i>

22
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,672
<i>Aah!
...was set up to take a fall,</i>

23
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:56,550
<i>And mike was finally able
to remember the past.</i>

24
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:59,430
Uhh! Uhh!

25
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:00,996
Aah!

26
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:05,712
<i>(Mary alice)
orson hodge had always assumed</i>

27
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,532
<i>That the moment before he died,</i>

28
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:11,027
<i>His entire life uld flash
before his eyes,</i>

29
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,932
<i>But as he fell from the roof of
the fairview memorial hospital,</i>

30
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,723
<i>It wasn't his life he saw.</i>

31
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>It was one night in particular.</i>

32
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:22,142
Monique?

33
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,364
I've got wonderful news.

34
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:27,195
<i>Bonnes nouvelles!</i>

35
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,553
Monique?

36
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:34,604
There's been an accident.

37
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,493
Oh, my god.

38
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,555
What have you done?

39
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,547
It was self-Defense.

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,362
I came to tell her to stay away
from you. She attacked me.

41
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,551
Mother, she's dead.

42
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,483
I know.

43
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,475
And i'm sorry,
but what's done is done.

44
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:59,780
What are you doing?

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,910
I'm lling the police.
No! I'll go to jail.

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,199
You killed someone!
I'm your mother!
You've got to help me!

47
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,771
But i loved her.

48
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:11,654
<i>I once lost someone i loved,
thanks to you.</i>

49
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,388
You owe me.

50
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:26,909
(Mike) hello?

51
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:31,616
Ms. Polier?

52
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:35,967
I've got that part
for e sink.

53
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,698
Hello?

54
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,114
Ms. Polier?

55
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,424
Ah, i'm sorry.

56
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,733
I'm monique's boyfriend.
She's upstairs lying down.

57
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,703
She wasn't... feeling well.

58
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,779
I'll just finish up the sink
and get out of your hair.

59
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,737
Uh, look, why don't you
let me take care of that?

60
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,837
I mean, i'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.

61
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:03,573
Oh, i don't mind staying.

62
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:05,931
Oh, i've, uh,
i've got it under control.

63
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:09,052
Um, here, let me, uh,
let me pay you.

64
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,528
That should cover it

65
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:18,763
Thanks.

66
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:20,849
Oh, hey, uh...

67
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,942
Don't forget your wrench.

68
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,666
You handled that
very well, son.

69
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,204
Now help me find a tarp.

70
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,597
Ugh!

71
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:57,115
What are you doing?

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,418
You don't want her identified
through dental records, do you?

73
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:03,130
Ugh!

74
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:10,775
I must say, i never realized
your job was so difficult.

75
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,749
It's not enough to kill her.

76
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:14,230
You have
to desecrate her body, too?

77
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,427
Get away from her!
Aah!

78
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:23,833
(Groans)
now look what you've done!

79
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,518
I think my damn hip's broken.

80
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:32,057
Help me.

81
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:37,971
<i>Yes...</i>

82
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,973
<i>Orson hodge had always assumed</i>

83
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:44,301
<i>That his life would flash
before his eyes</i>

84
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,486
<i>The moment before he died.</i>

85
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,397
Uhh!

86
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,920
<i>Luckily, for orson...
(man) hurry! Come on!</i>

87
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,826
<i>That moment...</i>

88
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,694
I got a pulse!
Let's get him inside!

89
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,715
<i>Was noscheduled for today.</i>

90
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:06,212

91
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:15,390

92
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:45,482
Dh315

93
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:49,176
<i>The first light of sunrise.</i>

94
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,471
<i>The sound of the cat purring.</i>

95
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,756
<i>The smell of fresh coffee...</i>

96
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,224
<i>Yes, there are many things</i>

97
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:06,429
<i>A housewife
likes to wake up to,</i>

98
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,465
<i>But an unexpected guest
in her bed</i>

99
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,331
<i>Is not one of them.</i>

100
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,276
Zach?

101
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,783
You're... in your underwear.

102
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:20,222
Well, i-I needed
to put on something

103
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:20,531
To get the morning paper.

104
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,300
You've been here all night?

105
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:27,308
Sure.
I'm not one of those guys

106
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,030
Who gets up and leaves
right ter.

107
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,692
Right after what?

108
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,766
Do you wanna hear me say it?
Fine.

109
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:36,074
You were amazing.

110
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:43,468
Okay, listen to me
very carefully,

111
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,672
And this is no time
to be vague.

112
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,699
What exactly
was i amazing at?

113
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,538
Please tell me
that once contained a mint.

114
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:59,482
After a few drks,
you told me how lonely you were

115
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,947
And that i was the kindest man
you'd met in a few years,

116
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:04,283
And, uh, then you kissed me.
(Gasps)

117
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,395
And then you took off your--
Okay, okay, stop talking.
I'm getting nauseous.

118
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:12,876
This is so great.

119
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,523
I have so many
awesome plans for us.

120
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,456
"Us." (Chuckles) oh, man.
It feels so good to say that.

121
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,544
Oh, god. Here it comes.

122
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,494
Would you like me
to hold your hair, honey?

123
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:26,287
No!

124
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,027
Hey, what are you doing?

125
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,347
I'm lying in bed, inking about
the opening tonight,

126
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,199
When it hits me...

127
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,605
We could
run out of breadsticks.

128
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,286
Oh, honey,
you have had, what,

129
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,421
Four hours sleep
in the past three days?

130
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,372
You need rest. Who cares
if we run out of breadsticks?

131
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:01,752
I do!

132
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,453
Tonight's the most important
night of my life.

133
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:04,938
Everything's
gotta be perfect.

134
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,333
Here. Try that.

135
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:10,926
It's good.

136
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:12,538
No. Too salty.

137
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,544
If they're salty,
we'll sell more beer.

138
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:16,797
See? You're a genius.

139
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,138
Don't patronize me!

140
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:21,227
Oh, my god.
This is gonna be a disaster.

141
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:23,129
Hey, chill out.

142
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,497
You're acting like i did
when i was six months pregnant.

143
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,607
Uh, excuse me.
You were hitting people.

144
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,483
Only two, and the mailman
had the good taste

145
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,297
Never to bring that up again.

146
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,471
Come on.
Let's go get some sleep.
The dough maker

147
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:36,735
And the chairs
get delivered at noon.

148
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,032
I know. I'm the one
that put in the order.

149
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,078
I will handle anything
that needs to be done.

150
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:45,258
And you, take these
and get some sleep.

151
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,813
Come on. We need you
at your best tonight.

152
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:53,323
You're right. I'm sorry.
Crazy. (Chuckles)

153
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,152
Ooh! Honey glaze.

154
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,667
Honey glaze will cut the salt
in the breadsticks.

155
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,746
Tom, i do not need
to be pregnant

156
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,764
To kick your ass.

157
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,139
Now go. Go on.

158
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,906
Andrew, you're here.

159
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,959
Oh, what happened to me?

160
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,926
You--You kinda had
an accident.

161
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,948
You fell off our ladder.

162
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,626
Oh, that's right.

163
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,933
(Sighs) is orson here?

164
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,382
Um...

165
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,120
Yeah, he's--
He's at the hospital,

166
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,939
But he's
not exactly visiting.

167
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,861
Suicide?

168
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:50,276
No. Orson would never
try to kill himself.

169
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,609
The police are wrong.
It must have been an accident.

170
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,184
But they found his footprints
on the trunk of his car.

171
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:58,578
The only reason
he'd be up there is to jump.
But why?

172
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,718
Maybe he was feeling guilty.

173
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,816
For what?

174
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,366
Mom,
i-I looked at that ladder.

175
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,990
Someone
sawed through the rung.

176
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,544
And you think...

177
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,524
I heard you two
in your room the other day.

178
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:18,456
The next day,
you fall and nearly die.

179
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,103
You-Ou think
that's a coincidence?

180
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,043
And you say
he's just down the hall?

181
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,300
Yeah, but don't worry.

182
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,115
I-I told them
not to let him near you,

183
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,844
And we're gonna get you home
as soon as wcan.

184
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,630
Can i help you?

185
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,606
I'm here to pick up
my wife's belongings.

186
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:42,845
Uh, jane hainsworth?

187
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,112
Oh, yes.

188
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,019
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

189
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,963
I'll be right back.

190
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,343
You doing okay?

191
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,473
Not really,
but having you here helps.

192
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,019
Oh, hey, mrs. Mayer.

193
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,981
Andrew, what are you doing
at the hospital?

194
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,445
You--You haven't heard?

195
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,153
Hey.

196
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,903
Susan.

197
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,363
I just heard from andrew
what happened.

198
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,667
I had to come see you.

199
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,096
If you want me
to go, uh...

200
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,656
No, no. Come in.

201
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,341
I know we've been fighting.

202
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,960
Something like this happens,

203
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,857
It just puts everything
into perspective.

204
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,024
I am so sorry.
It was all my fault.

205
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,461
If i hadn't got so caught up
in protecting mike--

206
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:34,776
Susan, stop.

207
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,209
Mike is innocent.

208
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,325
He had nothing to do
with monique polier's murder.

209
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:42,699
Do you know something?

210
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:46,954
Yes, and i intend
to go to the police.

211
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,894
Oh, my god.

212
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,635
Does this have something
to do with orson's accident?

213
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,919
I can't tell you
right now.

214
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,923
You're just gonna have
to trust me.

215
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,310
Can you do that?

216
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,991
Of course.

217
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,993
I should let you rest.

218
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,755
So we're back
to being friends?

219
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,745
We never really stopped.

220
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,776
Um, excuse me. These--These
things don't belong to jane.

221
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:31,952
Are you sure?

222
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,946
Oh, every couple
has their secrets,

223
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:36,075
But i'm pretty sure
she wasn't a closet whittler.

224
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,365
"Mike delfino."

225
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,382
Oh, these are mike's things?

226
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,960
Yep. Someone made
a big mistake.

227
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,375
Helen, you screwed up
the labels again!

228
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,668
Oh! He had an engagement ring
with him.

229
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:57,823
Ooh, that's pretty.

230
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,515
You know,
mike and i are good friends.

231
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:05,011
I-I could return these things
to him, if--If you like.

232
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,734
Sorry. He'll have
to pick 'em up himself.

233
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,361
It's hospital policy.

234
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:13,795
It's also hospital policy

235
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:14,718
To put the right labels
on the right boxes!

236
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,545
Ian! Ian, you're not gonna
believe this.

237
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,360
Bree just told me
she can prove mike's innocent.

238
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,508
What?

239
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,284
It's true.

240
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,290
He's gonna be a free man.
Isn't that great?

241
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,658
Yes,
it's bloody fantastic.

242
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,133
Oh! Whoops.

243
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,561
Here. I'm gonna go get bree
some flowers.

244
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,404
I'll be right back.

245
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,952
No, no, that's great news.
Thank you, doctor.

246
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,757
(Telephone beeps)
so orson's
gonna pull through?

247
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,297
You'd rather he didn't?

248
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,162
No.

249
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,194
I just don't know what
he's gonna tell the police

250
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,324
When he wakes up.

251
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,569
It wasn't your fault.

252
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,532
Orson falling off that roof
was an accident, right?

253
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,884
Well, sort of.
Sort of?

254
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,991
Depending on what
orson tells them,

255
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,709
I could get charged
with attempted murder.

256
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:15,601
Well, so i'm so glad she has you
to take care of her,

257
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:18,151
And of course
your mom comes first, andrew.

258
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,600
And i wouldn't even ask except,
you know,

259
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,352
We're opening tonight--
Chairs are here.

260
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,450
Uh, uh-Huh.

261
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,172
Oh, god. Seriously?

262
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:28,756
Fantastic. Thank you.
It's just two quick hours,

263
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,503
And then we'll get you
right back home with your mom.

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
Thank you, andrew.
Okay. Bye-Bye.
(Telephone beeps)

265
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:37,447
Did you finish folding
the takeout menus?

266
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,299
You never asked me
to do that.

267
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:42,128
I shouldn't have to tell you
every little thing, you know.

268
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,949
Show some initiative.

269
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:46,375
<i>Wait. Wherare my chairs?
I didn't order these.</i>

270
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,007
You lynette scavo?
Yes.

271
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:53,802
Well, then you ordered these.
No. Why would i order
50 high chairs

272
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,540
For the opening
of a pizzeria?
I don't know.

273
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,253
I thought it was one of those,
uh, kiddie pizza places

274
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,850
With the games
and the animatronic rats.
Give me that.

275
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,970
Easy there, sally.

276
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,001
"Animatronic rats."
Where do they find you people?

277
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:04,959
Okay, okay, here it is.

278
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,604
See? I ordered 50
of item number 7-3...

279
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,309
Oh, huh.

280
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,123
Did we find the mistake?

281
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,629
I, um, i switched
the 7 and the 1.

282
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:14,923
Mm-Hmm.

283
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,411
So... we're both wrong.

284
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,653
Now this place opens
in five hours.

285
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,065
How long will it take
to fix this?

286
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:27,710
Hi. I need to rent 50 chairs
by tonight at 5:00.

287
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,037
(Blows air) what?

288
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,463
Why not?

289
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:33,110
What do you mean,
it's bar mitzvah season?

290
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,972
There's no such thing.

291
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:38,014
Oh! You still have five.
I will take those. Scavo.

292
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,053
Okay, that brings us to 22.

293
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,728
Javi, rico,
we got chairs to find. Move it.

294
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,003
Wow.

295
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,457
Looks like someone crawled into
a bottle of merlot last night.

296
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,428
I sort of threw myself
a little birthday party.

297
00:15:58,145 --> 00:16:00,533
So if you don't mind, i'd like
to get back to my dry heaving.

298
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,443
Quick question--
Was that zach young

299
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:05,022
I saw leavinyour house
8:00 this morning?

300
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:09,043
Uh, oh, yeah. Um...

301
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,098
He just came by to, uh...

302
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:13,563
Drop off a birthday rd.

303
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,060
Really cute little cat
with balloons. (Chuckles)

304
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,755
All right, bye.

305
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,305
Follow-Up.

306
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:25,093
Why was zach in your driveway
at 7:00 this morning...

307
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:26,974
In his underwear?

308
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,257
We had sex last night!

309
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:40,455
What?!
I mean, i think we did.
That's what he told me.

310
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,734
Weren't you there?
No, i don't remember
anything!

311
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:46,162
I just woke up,
and he was in bed next to me.

312
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,375
Thanks again, gaby.
Hey, carlos.

313
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,945
If you don't remember,

314
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,866
Then how can you be sure
that you and zach had sex?

315
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,817
Well,
we were both half-Naked,

316
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,268
And--And there was
a condom wrapper.

317
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,001
And he said i was amazing,
which totally sounds like me.

318
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,720
He thinks we're a couple now.
You have to help me.

319
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,230
(Laughs)
i am not getting involved.

320
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,884
God, i can't believe you bagged
another neighborhood kid.

321
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,261
Where are you going?

322
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,215
To warn the scavo boys.

323
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,981
I wanna speak to my wife.

324
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,566
She's resting. If we can
get back to these questions...

325
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:38,376
I fell off a roof. I need
a physician, not a psychiatrist.

326
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,089
Well, i'm afraid
it's hospital policy

327
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,839
When there's
a suspected suicide attempt.

328
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:43,840
I didn't try to kill myself.

329
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:45,886
But you do have a certain...

330
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,233
History?

331
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,826
You spent most of 1976
in a psychiatric hospital.

332
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,148
I don't care
to discuss that.

333
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,516
You won't be leaving here
until we do.

334
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,910
My parents
were very regious.

335
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,598
When i was 16,
my fher had an affair,

336
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,932
Caused quite a scandal
at our church.

337
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,805
<i>(Orson) he became depressed.
He started drinking heavily.</i>

338
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,011
<i>My mother grew concerned.</i>

339
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,826
<i>She didn't like
leaving him alone.</i>

340
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,538
One night,
she had to visit a sick friend,

341
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,131
And she asked me
to keep an eye on him.

342
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:29,822
But i had made plans
with friends.

343
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,198
<i>I thought i could
duck out for a while.</i>

344
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:33,319
<i>When i got home,
i found him in the bathroom.</i>

345
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,068
You blamed yourself?

346
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,222
Ah, i didn't need to.

347
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:46,334
Mother blamed me enough
for bo of us.

348
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,443
That must have
caused quite a strain

349
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,161
In your relationship.

350
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:50,897
Yes.

351
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:56,825
But now and then,

352
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:58,065
She suggests little ways
i might make it up to her.

353
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,259
Yes, i'm calling to check
on the status of a patient.

354
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,236
Last name hodge.

355
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:07,088
What do you mean,
"which hodge"?

356
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,239
Gloria! Thank god. I thought
you'd forgotten about me.

357
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,070
When are you
letting me out of here?

358
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,580
It won't be long now.

359
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,173
In fact, something interesting
happened last night.

360
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:24,329
Orson
tried to kill himself.

361
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,324
Oh, my goodness.
Is he okay?

362
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,536
He'll be fine.

363
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:29,004
My point is,

364
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,710
Suicide is hardly the act
of a happily married man.

365
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:37,168
Gloria, for god sake,
give it up.

366
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,529
He doesn't love me.

367
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:40,666
He will, dear.

368
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,923
Bree will be gone soon,

369
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,634
And he'll need a good woman
like you to console him.

370
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,001
What are you gonna do
to bree?

371
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:52,798
(Alma) gloria?

372
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:54,821
Gloria?

373
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,060
Oh, hey, hon.

374
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,323
Hey.
Did you get some sleep?

375
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:19,516
Yes. I'm still kind of groggy
from those pills, but...

376
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,733
And now i'm awake.

377
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,535
Okay, little mix-Up
with the new chairs.

378
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:31,082
<i>Which you were in charge of.</i>

379
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,082
Okay, okay,
we could point fingers,

380
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,136
But what's important

381
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:35,907
Is forgetting about
what we expected

382
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:39,819
And focusing on what we have,
which isn't so bad.

383
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,160
I mean, all the different
kinds of chairs

384
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,475
Give the place
a kind of bohemian vibe.

385
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,357
Plus, if we get
a lot of babies--

386
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,761
Look,
we're just totally set.

387
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,386
Tom, i'm sorry.

388
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:55,685
I am. I'm sorry.

389
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:59,573
I just--I realize
it's not... perfect.

390
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,601
But...

391
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,856
Please say something.

392
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,161
What can i say, lynette?

393
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,193
It is what it is.

394
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,202
<i>Why do i
have to babysit mom?</i>

395
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,211
All my friends
are gonna be at the opening.

396
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,352
Austin was gonna
sneak us beer!

397
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,186
Damn it, danielle,
i have to work!

398
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,691
Our mother's
lying helpless upstairs

399
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:30,267
'Cause her husband
tried to kill her.

400
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:33,112
Now for just one night,
could you try toe responsible?

401
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,815
I liked you better
when you were a psychopath!

402
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,775
Here you go.

403
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,075
Ah.

404
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,350
Wow, you're... here.
I wouldn't have missed it.

405
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,448
You know how i feel
about lynette and tom.

406
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,402
Uh, look, zach,
i'm glad you're here.

407
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:14,439
I've been wanting to talk
about us.

408
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:17,081
Me, too. You, uh,
being in my life now,

409
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:19,853
Having the connection
that we do,

410
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:24,396
This is really the--The first
time that i've been happy

411
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,211
Since my mother
killed herself.

412
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:28,551
Would you excuse me a send?
Huckles)

413
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,651
Of course, baby.
Hurry back.

414
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:31,636
Yeah, okay. All right.

415
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,983
<i>I am in hell.</i>

416
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:39,346
I just tried
to break up with zach,

417
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,023
And the little twerp
played the dead mommy card.

418
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,876
<i>Well, u can't let him
make you fell guilty.
But i am guilty.</i>

419
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,212
I don't remember how
we ended up in bed together.

420
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,931
Maybe--Maybe i led him on.

421
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:48,543
I gotta be sensitive here.

422
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,481
Cod you
threaten him for me?

423
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:52,660
What?

424
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,154
You know, intimidate him.

425
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:56,791
Do the whole jealous,
latin ex-Husband thing you do.

426
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,949
Tell him if you can't have me,
nobody can.
Forget it. I'm not gonna

427
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,021
Hey, i am looking t
for zach, too.

428
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,504
If i dump him,
it'll destroy him emotionally.

429
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,031
Better to scare him off.

430
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,215
(Sighs) please?

431
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:15,113
Fine.

432
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:16,253
Thank you!

433
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:17,606
Okay, look, there he goes.

434
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,150
Go! Go get all cholo
on his ass.

435
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,230
Hey, mr. Solis.

436
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,528
Hey.

437
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:43,370
Look, i need to talk to you
about something.

438
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,256
It's a little awkward,
but...

439
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,001
Mr. Solis?

440
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,684
What?

441
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:58,180
You were just saying
that something was awkward?

442
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,115
Never mind.

443
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:02,982
Forget
that i said anything.
(Urinal flushes)

444
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,345
Hey. So how'd it go?

445
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,981
You did not have sex
with zach young.

446
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:14,234
Really?
Did he tell you that?

447
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,292
He didn't have to.

448
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,824
What?

449
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,194
I was standing next to him
at the urinal.

450
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,446
I don't care
how drunk you were.

451
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:24,028
If you had sex with him,
you'd remember.

452
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,930
(Gasps) little zach young?

453
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,474
Well, just how much
would i have remembered?

454
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,082
Uh, hey.
What are you doing here?

455
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,761
I thought bree
might like some soup.

456
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:56,280
It's my own special recipe.

457
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,984
I'm surprised
to find you home.

458
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:04,958
I thought the whole street
was going to scavo's tonight.

459
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,929
Well, i was supposed to go,

460
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:10,104
But, uh, andrew said i had
to stay home and babysit mom.

461
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,914
Well, that's just silly.

462
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:16,616
A vibrant young lady like you
should be at the party,

463
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,499
Turning boys' heads.

464
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,540
You go.

465
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:23,031
I'll look after
your mother.

466
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:24,398
You mean it?

467
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,306
Just take
her dinner up first.

468
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:31,045
I don't think i can
manage the tray with my cane.

469
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:33,196
Thanks, grandma.
You're t best!

470
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:34,884
Mm.

471
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,808
This soup smells so good.

472
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:40,654
You wanna score some points?
Don't say i brought it.

473
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,247
Tell her
you made it yourself.

474
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,037
Hey!

475
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:24,145
Hello?

476
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,134
Over here!

477
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,489
Aah!

478
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,526
Honey, there is a line
out the door.

479
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,501
We are gonna
make a killing tonight.

480
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,447
I'm happy for ya.
For us.

481
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,989
Now it's "us"?

482
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,695
Because i thought
i was the one

483
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,039
Who was trying
to ruin everything.

484
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,144
Hey, look,
i know i overreacted--

485
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,100
Yes, you did.
But i have customers.

486
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,394
Oh!

487
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,182
The place
came out great, huh?

488
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,163
Sure did.

489
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,206
Looks like, uh,
the whole street's here.

490
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:13,102
Yeah.

491
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,878
Except for orson,
who fell off a roof.

492
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,011
You know anything
abouthat?

493
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,470
Why would you think that?

494
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,476
I heard you talking to carlos.
Now answer the question.

495
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,823
I-I can't
talk about it here.

496
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,791
It's complicated.

497
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,811
It always is with you.

498
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:39,208
Hey. I just had a slice
of pizza. It's pretty good.

499
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:43,333
Is it really good,

500
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:44,194
Or are you just pretending
you had a slice?

501
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,310
You and i did not have sex.
Admit it!

502
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:48,482
Of course we did.

503
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:52,548
Zach! How can you claim to care
about me and lie to my face?

504
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,493
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,010
I'm tired
of just being your friend.

506
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,433
I thought if you saw me
as a lover,

507
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:06,159
You can think of me as a man,
not--Not a boy.
Zach, a real man is honest.

508
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,702
All you've ever tried to do

509
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,159
Is bribe and trick me
into falling in love with you.

510
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,470
A little advice next time?
Don't play games.

511
00:28:12,697 --> 00:28:14,998
Just stand up
and be the kind of man

512
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,334
A woman would be proud
to share her life with.

513
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,409
(Singsong voice) hello!

514
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:28,019
I think it's high time
to make a toast.

515
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,806
(Woman) all right!
(Man) sure!

516
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:34,188
Um, tom, where are you?
Where--Ah. Tom, you did it.

517
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,074
There are a lot of people
in this room

518
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:39,799
That didn't think
you could pull it off.

519
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,031
Okay, well, maybe just me.

520
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,657
Anyway, congratulations.

521
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:50,117
The pizza is excellent,
and the service is sublime.

522
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,865
Cheers.
Cheers.

523
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:52,654
(Carlos) speech!

524
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:57,287
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

525
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,953
It means
everything in the world to me.

526
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:03,883
I-I gotta tell you, when i
arrived here this afternoon,

527
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,953
I saw all these weird chairs,

528
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,756
Um, i thought the evening
was gonna be a total disaster.

529
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:11,785
But now when i look out,
i can't even see the chairs.

530
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,663
I just see people eating,

531
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,660
Laughing
and having a great time.

532
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,480
It's absolutely perfect.

533
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,085
And none of this
would've happened

534
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,540
Without
my amazing partner lynette.

535
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,023
Who, uh...

536
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,287
To...

537
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:42,301
I'm sorry.Laughs)
i'm--I'm a little, uh...

538
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,787
(Laughs) i think what
my husband is trying to say is,

539
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:50,733
If you really want
to test a marriage,

540
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,644
Open a restaurant together.

541
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,433
Anyway, um,
thank you for coming.

542
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:57,820
Eat a lot and come back,
'cause our kids need braces.

543
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,108
Actually, as long as everyone
has their glasses raised,

544
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,493
I have something that--
That i wld like to say.

545
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:13,226
I, um, well,
i-I thought of waiting

546
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,393
For the perfect romantic spot
in which to ask this question,

547
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,298
But being here tonight,

548
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:18,144
Enveloped by so much love
and warmth, i realize that, um,

549
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:21,367
<i>This is
the perfect romantic spot.</i>

550
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,573
Susan mayer...

551
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,267
Drop the pizza.

552
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,410
Will you make me
the happiest man in the world

553
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:33,887
And be my wife?

554
00:30:33,987 --> 00:30:35,087
Mmm.

555
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,407
Absolutely, yes!

556
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:42,136
Whoo!
(Cheering)

557
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:51,223
Ladies and gentlemen,

558
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,503
Please, i-I have something
that i'd like to say also.

559
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,658
Gabrielle solis...

560
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:00,970
Will you marry me?

561
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:02,983
(Man) oh. Should i clap?

562
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,717
No, there will be
no clapping!

563
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:09,343
You, moron, come with me!

564
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,664
Time for your pills,
mr. Hodge.

565
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,175
Hmm? Oh.

566
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,010
Oh, it's after 6:00?
Mm-Hmm.

567
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,645
I need to speak with my wife.
What room is she in?

568
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,778
Oh, uh,
your wife checked out.

569
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,774
Already?

570
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:33,304
She was very eager to get home.
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

571
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:35,214
I-I have to talk to her.

572
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:37,760
Oh, that reminds me.
Your mother called.

573
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,445
She said she didn't want
to wake you up,

574
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,516
And she wanted to make sure
we'd be keeping you overnight.

575
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:44,402
Ms are like that--
So protective.

576
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,845
(Orson) bree, it's me.
Are you there?

577
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:56,943
Please, pick up.

578
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:58,810
Bree?

579
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,649
Please, somebody,
pickp the phone.

580
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,382
I know that you're mad--
I'm not mad, zach.
I'm done!

581
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:09,493
But you said to be honest.
I did not say
to humiliate me!

582
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,588
I'm sorry. All right?
I-I was just trying--

583
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:13,500
What do you want from me?

584
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,297
I want you
to leave me alone!

585
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:18,600
This friends thing
isn't gonna work

586
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,637
'Cause you're always
gonna want more,

587
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,434
<i>And i'm never
gonna love you... ever.</i>

588
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:24,762
20 years from now when you're
all middle-Aged and alone,

589
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,233
You'll regret this.

590
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,087
Okay, i'll take my chances.

591
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,939
Thought
you might need this.

592
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,629
Bless you.

593
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:48,514
So how did it go
with seabiscuit?

594
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,172
He's devastated.

595
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:51,408
Of course.

596
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:53,209
It's my fault.

597
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:57,028
I should've known

598
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:58,811
He couldn't handle the whole
"let's be friends" thing.

599
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,186
I don't blame him.

600
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,151
I'm having kind of a hard time
myself being just your friend,

601
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,735
Watching you with other guys,
being your confidant.

602
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:09,560
Really?

603
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,241
I think it's been nice.

604
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,413
For you, maybe.

605
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:19,160
Look, seriously,
i don't know how much longer

606
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:20,574
I'm gonna be able
to keep this up.

607
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,847
Wow.

608
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,736
Well, hang in there
as long as you can,

609
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,720
'Cause i still need you.

610
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,305
I'll do my best.

611
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:47,811
What are you doing here?

612
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,174
I have better things to do
than babysit mom.

613
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:52,243
She's fine.
Gloria's watching her.

614
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,586
What? I told you mom's ready
to go to the cops about orson.

615
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,407
How could you leave her at home
with his crazy mother?

616
00:33:58,543 --> 00:33:59,728
She brought soup!

617
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:13,636
Gloria?

618
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,507
What are you doing here?

619
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,489
I came
to take care of you.

620
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,901
I'm so sleepy.

621
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,745
Good. En the pills
are working.

622
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,181
Andrew? Danielle?

623
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,504
They're gone.

624
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,603
It's just us.

625
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:38,899
Now...

626
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,286
You rest, hon.

627
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:48,129
I'm gonna draw you
a nice, warm bath.

628
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:28,101
Oh, bree...

629
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:33,931
I wish i could
make you understand

630
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:36,255
How deeply i regret
having to do this.

631
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:38,729
Monique... that was easy.
She was a slut.

632
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,416
You're a good woman.

633
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,740
You didn't know
orson already had a wife.

634
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,721
But he did,

635
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,568
And he made a vow to her
before god.

636
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:57,205
What sort of mother would i be
if i let him break it?

637
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:04,178
I'm sorry.

638
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:10,682
But i will not let him be
his father's son.

639
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:37,398
Wake up, mr. Hodge.
I've got dinner.

640
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:50,885
That water's not too hot,
is it?

641
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:55,313
No. It's just right.

642
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:09,085
Mom? Are you all right?

643
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:16,181
Andrew?

644
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,411
You've done this before,
haven't you?

645
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,690
Ow! Oh! Aah!

646
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,690
Uhh!
Ane drops to floor)

647
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,690
No!

648
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,190
Aah!

649
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,470
Is she all right?

650
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,585
She will be.

651
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,536
Get her some blankets
and some dry clothes.

652
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,239
(Gloria) orson?

653
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,447
Orson!

654
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,252
Something's wrong.

655
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:43,049
(Weakly) i think
i'm... having a stroke.

656
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,216
You need an ambulance,
mother.

657
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:50,437
It's too bad
there's no one here

658
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:51,093
Who'd dream
of calling you one.

659
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,762
What are you doing?

660
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:05,599
I don't want her dying
in our house.

661
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:33,146
Hey there.
Are you all right?

662
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,202
(Weakly) your mother...

663
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,688
She tried to kill me.

664
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,457
Don't worry about her.

665
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,837
She's never gonna
hurt you again,

666
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,652
And neither will alma.

667
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:46,415
Alma?

668
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:49,341
She's dead.
What?

669
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,885
I don't know what happened,
but she's gone...

670
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:52,494
Oh.

671
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,359
And she's taking our troubles
with her.

672
00:40:56,807 --> 00:41:01,432
<i>(Orson) tomorrow morning,
one of our neighbors</i>

673
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:03,107
<i>Will stumble
on a gruesome surprise--</i>

674
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,088
<i>Two bodies side by side.</i>

675
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,756
<i>The police will conclude
that alma fell from the roof,</i>

676
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:18,690
<i>And when my mother found her,
she suffered a stroke.</i>

677
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:24,546
<i>When they search the house,</i>
