00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,040
[glass cracks]

2
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,280
[woman]<i> Okay, my people!</i>
<i>Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.</i>

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,840
[banging]

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,960
Hey. You awake yet?

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,080
- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- [woman] Company!

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,960
Something went down last night
in Her Falls,

7
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
a village about three miles east.

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,800
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Locals think it's roaches.

10
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
[woman] Roaches!

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!
[claps]

12
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,520
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,960
[laughs]

14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
[clamoring]

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey, new!

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
New!

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,000
It's Stripe.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,200
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
- with one of them roaches today.
- Uh-huh?

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
When you see one right here,

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
- I'll try.
- Try to ignore Len.

23
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,400
who could shit his own pants and miss.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,800
- Fuck you, farm girl.
- Farm girl?

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,960
[woman] Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
- Some of us are naturals.
- [engine starts]

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,880
Moving out!

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
Whoo! Yeah!

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
- [baby crying]
- [chickens clucking]

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
[soldiers speaking Danish]

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,880
- You can speak now.
- [robotic voice interpreting]

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,200
[speaking Danish]

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,080
- [machine]<i> It must have been roaches.</i>
- Roaches, you see them? You see?

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,240
- [speaking Danish]
- [machine] <i>I didn't see them.</i>

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,480
[machine]<i> I heard them.</i>
<i>All the mess. It must have been them.</i>

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,760
- Want a cookie?
- [man speaking Danish]

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
- Here you go.
- [machine]<i> They've been in the food.</i>

40
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
[speaking Danish]

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,080
[machine]<i> We'll have to destroy</i>
<i>everything they left.</i>

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,040
<i>No one will eat it.</i>

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,520
[woman] We can replace that, okay?

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
[machine interprets]

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,560
[man speaking Danish]

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,800
[machine]<i> They destroyed the cooler.</i>
<i>Broke it and took the parts.</i>

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,600
The cooler?
They stole parts from the cooler?

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,720
[machine interprets]

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,520
- Which way did they go?
- [machine interprets]

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
[speaks Danish]

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,960
[machine]<i> There were footprints</i>
<i>in the dirt leading that way.</i>

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,200
- Parn Heidekker.
- [machine beeps]

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,720
- Parn Heidekker.
- [machine beeps]

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,760
- Heidekker? Is that a name?
- [machine interprets]

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,480
Okay.

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,040
I have child who is scared.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
I will. I promise.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,840
[whispering in Danish]

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
[woman] Stripe!

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,920
[whispering continues]

62
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

64
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,720
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,120
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
keep them calm and reassured.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,960
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,960
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,920
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
Seems like mental health issues.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,360
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

76
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,120
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,640
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

80
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

83
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,120
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
Hell, yeah.

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,480
[whirring]

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Portals front and rear.

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
Windows blacked out.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

89
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,960
Lennard, you use the boomer.

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
[cocks gun]

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
[cocks gun]

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,560
- [woman] Check.
- [man] Check.

94
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
Check.

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,160
[woman] Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,720
Take them one at a time and slow.

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
We go in here.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

100
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Okay.

101
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,480
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

102
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
Except on a roach.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,920
- [woman] Except on a roach.
- [laughs]

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,960
[lock turns]

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,440
- [woman] Morning, sir.
- [machine interprets]

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,720
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

107
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
Okay.

108
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,400
- What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
That's what we're doing.

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,880
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,960
Check the upstairs rooms.

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,560
[woman] Relax. I'm not your enemy.

113
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Where are they?

114
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,600
Where are who?

115
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
You know, we got a whole bunch

116
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,520
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

117
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,040
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

118
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
You know anything about that?

119
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
No.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,760
[woman]
See, it's not just what they stole.

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
- No one's gonna eat it.
- [whispers] Stripe.

123
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,840
[woman]
Makes life harder for everyone.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,880
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,080
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

126
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
I agree. All life is sacred so...

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,360
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

128
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,280
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

129
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
I get it. We get it.

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
- [door bangs]
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,120
- [door bangs]
- [bird squawks]

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,080
[woman] There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
The sickness they're carrying.

134
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,840
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

135
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,080
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,000
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

137
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,920
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Bingo.

139
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
[woman]
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

140
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,720
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Fucking roach nest.

142
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,880
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,840
[woman] Every roach you save today,

144
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,000
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

145
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,160
You can't still see them as human.

146
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,000
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

147
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,520
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

148
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,640
That's just the hard truth.

149
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
Gotta make sacrifices.

150
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,280

153
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,520
What the fuck?

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,280
- [slashing sound]
- [screeching]

155
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,240

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Fuck!

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,880
[heavy breathing]

352
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,360
[gasps]

353
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,120
[heavy breathing]

354
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
- [rattling]
- [high-pitched whistling]

355
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,560
[gasps]

356
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,960
- [baby crying]
- [chattering]

357
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,960
- Way to go, fuck fingers.
- [scoffs]

358
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,200
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

359
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,600
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

360
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,920
[Raiman] Well, all right.

361
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
[woman] It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

362
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,240
It's not far from here.

363
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,440
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

364
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,960
Can we hurry it up here?

365
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,520
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

366
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,360
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

367
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,200
[whirring]

368
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,360
Okay, you see that?

369
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,200
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

370
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,280
And there are some cables.

371
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,040
- There's got to be roaches leaching power.
- Why here?

372
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,240
[high-pitched whistling]

373
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,720
Christ knows.

374
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
All right.

375
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,360
Better dial it in.

376
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
[groans quietly]

377
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,960
[groans]

378
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,920
Control. This is Medina.

379
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,240
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

380
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,240
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

381
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,920
- Roger so far.
- [sniffing]

382
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,760
- You all right there?
- Smell the grass.

383
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
We can't usually smell nothing.

384
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,240
- You ever noticed that?
- [Raiman] No, I never noticed that.

385
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,360
[Medina] Requesting course of action.

386
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,160
Didn't read. Please repeat.

387
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Okay.

388
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,720
Control says we should fall back
and await comm...

389
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,360
- [gunfire]
- [Raiman] Shit!

390
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,520
[gunshot]

391
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,960
Medina.

392
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,320
[gunshot]

393
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,760
- [gunshot]
- Oh!

394
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,320
Medina. [panting]

395
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,120
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

396
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,160
[Stripe whimpers]

397
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

398
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,480
Rai! Rai, come on.

399
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,080
Okay.

400
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,440
[whirring]

401
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

402
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,200
Fuck. Piece of shit.

403
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,120
Okay, Stripe.

404
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,640
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

405
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,040
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

406
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,360
- Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

407
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,840
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

408
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
- I'm with you.
- Let's go!

409
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,160
- [gunfire]
- Follow me!

410
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,600
[Raiman]
Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

[Stripe groans, panting]

415
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,760
- [gunshot]
- Come on, man! What the fuck?

416
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,800
[breathes heavily]

417
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,280
What the fuck is this shit?

418
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,040
Let's go.

419
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,600
[Raiman] Stripe!

420
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,800
[breathes heavily]

421
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,360
[door creaks]

422
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
- [screams]
- Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey.

423
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,680
- [wails]
- Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

424
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,720
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

425
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

426
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,520
- Go on, get out of here. Go on.
- [panting]

427
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,040
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

428
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,760
[panting]

429
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Go on. Get.

430
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,040

433
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,160
[Raiman] Come on!

434
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,520
- Rai, what did you do?
- [Raiman] Shut up! Come on!

435
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,560
What did you do, Rai?

436
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,120
[breathes heavily]

- [woman] No!

450
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,760
- Run!
- What the fuck are you doing?

451
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,880
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches! [yells]

452
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

453
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,240
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You got some blown shit.

454
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,200
- Pull it together!
- No.

[panting] Are you all right?

460
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,440
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

461
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,360
Come on!

462

[breathes heavily]

466
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
You better run.

[wincing]

468
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,440

473
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
Here.

474
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
I'm all right.

475
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,720
[panting]

476
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,840
You see me as I am.

477
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,360
Of course I see you.

478
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
You don't see roach?

479
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,360
You ain't a roach.

480
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,320
Roaches is all...

481
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,400
Fucked up?

482
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,080
Roaches don't speak.

483
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,400
You just can't hear us.

484
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,080
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

485
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
The Mass system?

486
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,240
They put it in your head to help you fight,

487
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,280
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

488
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,440
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

489
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,960
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

490
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,400
You're roaches?

491
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,640
But I've seen roaches.

492
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,480
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

493
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,840
- Animals?
- No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

494
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
The implant made you see this.

495
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,320
[groans]

496
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,360
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

497
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,560
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

498
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,200
They're scared of the roaches.

499
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,400
- They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

500
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

501
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,880
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

502
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,680
What you see now.

503
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

504
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,160
[cocks gun]

505
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,080

506
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
[birds squawking]

507
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,800
Ten years ago, it began.

508
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,320
Post-war.

509
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,400
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

510
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,880
then the register,
the emergency measures.

511
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,840
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

512
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,840
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

513
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,520
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

514
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,520
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

515
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,440
They say that our blood cannot go on.

516
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,680
That we cannot go on.

517
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,080
My name was Catarina.

518
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
He was Alec.

519
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Now we're just roach.

520
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,160
But now...

521
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,720
Now you see me.

522
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,440
Now you see me.

523
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,360
Rai?

524
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
- Rai, no!

525
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,720

[panting]

527
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,680
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

528
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,240
- None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

529
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,560
None of it's true.

530
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,520
[spits]

531
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,520
- Fuck you.
- [thud]

532
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,640
Get up. Back against the wall.

533
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Get up!

534
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,360
You want me to come in there?

535
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,120
[Arquette]
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

536
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,960
[door opens]

537
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,080
Thank you, Briley.

538
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,960
[door closes]

539
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,440
Stripe.

540
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,040
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

541
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,880
I got you a coffee.

542
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,960
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

543
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,960
Is this the thing?

544
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,240
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

545
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,800
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

546
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,120
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

547
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,240
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

548
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,200
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

549
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,520
than we give them credit for.

550
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,960
The whole thing is a lie.

551
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,840
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

552
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,240
Roaches.

553
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,280
They look just like us.

554
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,560
Of course they do.

555
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,600
That's why they're so dangerous.

556
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,840
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

557
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,920
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

558
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other. [laughs]

559
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,000
Which is a good thing.

560
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,600
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

561
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,920
Come on, sit down.

562
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,440
[groans]

563
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,280
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

564
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,920
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

565
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,960
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

566
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,680
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

567
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,000
They did it on purpose.

568
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,360
British Army. World War I.

569
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,880
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

570
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,840
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

571
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,880
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

572
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,960
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

573
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,440
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

574
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,120
Now what does that tell you?

575
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,400
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

576
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,880
had the military got its shit together.

577
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,360
So we adapted.

578
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,600
Better training. Better conditioning.

579
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,200
Then comes the Vietnam War,

580
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,160
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

581
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,760
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

582
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,600
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

583
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,560
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

584
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,440
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

585
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,600
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

586
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,080
It helps you with your intel.

587
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,840
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

588
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,120
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

589
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,160
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

590
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,080
You don't hear the shrieks.

591
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,040
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

592
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,760
They're human beings.

593
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

594
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,720
Higher rates of cancer.

595
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,920
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

596
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,160
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

597
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,280
It's all there.

598
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,360
The screening shows it.

599
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,680
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

600
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,640
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

601
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,920
The villagers won't do it.

602
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,280
The folks back home won't do it.

603
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,800
They don't have Mass.

604
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,840
Mass lets you do it.

605
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,720
You.

606
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,080
You're protecting the bloodline.

607
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,200
And that, my friend, is an honour.

608
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,440
There's no honour here.

609
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,440
It's just killing.

610
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,920
- Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

611
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,280
You knew all of this. All along.

612
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,960
What are you talking about?

613
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,640
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

614
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,600
- [laughs]
- Set up. Every soldier does.

615
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,120
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

616
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,480
You have to accept it. Willingly.

617
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,480
It's exactly what you did.

618
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,360
[man]<i> So you see the terms</i>
<i>and conditions there?</i>

619
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,200
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

620
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,080
What is that?

621
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,720
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

622
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,200
[man]<i> Basically, it says you agree</i>
<i>to Mass implant activation.</i>

623
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,800
- I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

624
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,240
- [man]<i> Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
<i>- Yeah, all right.</i>

625
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,600
[man]<i> Part of what you're agreeing to</i>
<i>is not realising</i>

626
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,080
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

627
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,480
<i>If you follow me.
You won't recall this conversation.</i>

628
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,720
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

629
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,320
Turn it off.

630
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,680
- [man]<i> So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

631
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,440
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

632
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,800
<i>- Right here?</i>
- [man]<i> Yes, please.</i>

633
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,600
<i>That's dope.</i>

634
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,120
<i>[faint beeping]</i>

635
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,480
I didn't do that!

636
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,240
[faint beeping]

637
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,240
- I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

638
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,200
[beeping]

639
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,880
- I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

640
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,760
- What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

641
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,960
- I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

642
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,560
Give me my fucking eyes back.

643
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,240
- Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

644
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,520
- [grunts]
- Let me lay out your options!

645
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,000
[breathes heavily]

646
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,720
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

647
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,880
All the recollections
of the past few days,

648
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,240
including this conversation, erased.

649
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,720
No way.

650
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,640
Option two's incarceration.

651
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,680
- I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

652
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,440
Mass is a friend.

653
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,680
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

654
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,560
I ain't having this Mass shit.

655
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,480
No more. No way.

656
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,680
Okay.

657
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,640
Well...

658
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,960
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

659
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,600
[beeps]

660
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,440
[Stripe] What's happening?

661
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Where am I?

662
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

663
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,120
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

664
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,600
Hey, no, no, no. No.

665
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,680
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

666
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,800
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

667
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,440
No. Make it stop.

668
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,480
- No! Please.
- [whirring]

669
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,440
Make it stop!

670
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,480
- Please!
- [gunfire]

671
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,440
No! No!

672
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,640
[gasps]

673
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,720
- [screams]
- [gasps] No!

674
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,200
[whimpers]

675
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,320
- [stabbing sounds]
- [screams]

676
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,080
Fuck off! Stop it!

677
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,400
- [stabbing sound]
- [groans]

678
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,440
- [stabbing sound]
- No!

679
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,960
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

680
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,000
Is this what you want?

681
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,640
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

682
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,120
[whimpers]

683
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,760
[beeps]

684
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,800
[Stripe whimpering]

685
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,440
[Arquette] We can make that go away.

686
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,200
This conversation goes away too.

687
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,480
All of it.

688
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,760
But you gotta say the word.

689
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Just say the word, Stripe.

690
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,800
And it all goes away.

691
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,080
Just say the word.
