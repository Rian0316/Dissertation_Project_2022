1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,261
First off, I want to
thank you both for coming.

2
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,796
Yeah, yeah, what'd he do?

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,942
Uh, he didn't do anything.

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,500
Gosh, Tom, I want to believe you.

5
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:13,492
Okay, the problem is,
the curriculum here

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,439
is not challenging enough for Sheldon.

7
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:16,867
Now, he gets bored

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,598
and maybe doesn't express himself

9
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,211
in the most productive way.

10
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:26,850
And so the square of sine
plus cosine equals one.

11
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,418
Sheldon.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,906
I don't want to embarrass you,

13
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,587
so I'm going to give you a moment

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,414
to think about what you just said.

15
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,278
Ms. MacElroy.

16
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,861
What?

17
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:40,080
I'm wondering if you read
the book you assigned to us,

18
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,282
because I did.

19
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:42,718
20 laps.

20
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:47,773
Cooper.

21
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,640
If you're going to ask us to run,

22
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,209
don't you think you
should lead by example?

23
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,942
So you're saying he's
being rude to his teachers?

24
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,384
That's unacceptable. I'll-I'll
give him a talkin' to.

25
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:02,085
I don't know if I'd call him rude.

26
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,387
Well, put a word on it.

27
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:05,903
Rude, let's go with rude.

28
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:06,990
Rude is good.

29
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:08,695
So what do you want us to do?

30
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:11,995
I want you to consider another
approach to his education.

31
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:13,848
- Okay.
- What does that mean?

32
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:15,732
I recently had a nice chat with the head

33
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:18,028
of Wilmot Academy for Gifted Children.

34
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,938
Now, I told her all about
Sheldon, and she seemed to think

35
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,474
he would be a perfect fit over there.

36
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:26,308
We already looked into private school.

37
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,316
We can't afford it.

38
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,013
- Not unless you're giving me a raise.
- I'm not.

39
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,915
Okay, just checking.

40
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,023
But I can tell you this.

41
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:36,119
Wilmot has been known

42
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,283
to give children like
Sheldon full scholarship.

43
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:39,418
Take a look at that.

44
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,976
- My goodness.
- No kidding.

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,693
Yeah, just read up on it.

46
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:44,027
Give it some thought.

47
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:46,029
Hold on.

48
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,166
This place is in Dallas,
that's three hours away.

49
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,601
Well, yeah, but, uh,

50
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:53,215
what they do in cases like yours,

51
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,731
they look for a local family

52
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,934
for him to live with.
And, George, Dallas?

53
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:58,956
Dallas is certainly close enough

54
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,825
that he can come home on the weekends.

55
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:03,765
Look, we appreciate

56
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,500
you going to bat for him, but he's just

57
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,383
a wee little thing.

58
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:08,819
We can't ship him off to Dallas.

59
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,320
Shouldn't we talk about this first?

60
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,593
What's there to talk about, George?

61
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,758
This could be a great
opportunity for Sheldon.

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,360
He's nine years old.

63
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,739
Oh, come on, you can't
measure him in Earth years.

64
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:20,530
You're saying he's an alien?

65
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,153
Well, in George's defense,

66
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,801
that idea has been tossed around...

67
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,133
a little bit.

68
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,869
That's a bad joke.

69
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,772
Look, I understand
this is a big decision.

70
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:33,046
If you change your mind, give me a call.

71
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,442
I'd be more than happy
to set up an interview.

72
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,546
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.
- You bet.

73
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,780
Thank you.

74
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:41,183
Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:44,920
Maybe you all are the aliens.

76
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,257
I love my job.

77
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:11,779

78
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:14,149
Well, I don't understand
how you could turn this down.

79
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,875
This place looks fantastic.

80
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,898
It's 200 miles away, Mom.

81
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:19,354
I know where Dallas is.

82
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,323
I used to buy my marijuana there.

83
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,437
Really?

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,792
I said "used to".

85
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,218
Then I got pregnant with this one

86
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,960
and all the fun stopped.

87
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,908
All I am saying is that

88
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,968
this would be a great
opportunity for Sheldon.

89
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,636
I know, you're right.

90
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:36,338
Whoa, she's right?

91
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,206
I said the same thing
in Petersen's office,

92
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,808
you looked at me like I was an idiot.

93
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,943
Yeah, that's the look.

94
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,379
Maybe y'all are being a
little selfish about this.

95
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:46,393
Selfish? We're thinking of him.

96
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:47,861
Well, that's all well and good,

97
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,085
but maybe you should be
thinking about the whole world.

98
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,322
I mean,

99
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:55,189
what if Einstein's
parents had held him back?

100
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,992
We wouldn't even have the...

101
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:58,793
Well, I was gonna say atomic bomb,

102
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,674
but there's probably a better example.

103
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:02,097
Here's a crazy idea:

104
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,432
how about we ask Sheldon
what he thinks of all this?

105
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:07,335
Go ahead, but he's not gonna want to go.

106
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,971
This is his home, we're his family.

107
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:12,580
Sheldon, can you come
in here for a minute?!

108
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,744
Yes?

109
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:18,246
- Have a seat. We want to talk to you.
- All right.

110
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,918
So, today we found out
about a school in Dallas

111
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,186
for really smart kids.

112
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:26,588
When can I start?

113
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:30,025
Hold on. Dallas is far away,

114
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,394
so you'd have to live
with another family.

115
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,862
Do they have a dog?

116
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:36,531
Uh, we don't know.

117
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,266
Well, can you make some calls?

118
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:42,737
I guess, but wouldn't
you miss your mom and dad?

119
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,572
Oh.

120
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,518
Yes, I suppose I will.

121
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,064
So, when are you calling about the dog?

122
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,117
You know him so well.

123
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,512
What's wrong with them?

124
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,980
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,949
They're so quiet.

126
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,651
Are they on medication?

127
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,171
No, they're just smart like you.

128
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:26,175
I've been going to school in a zoo.

129
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,991
Not sure about these uniforms.

130
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,527
Kinda froufrou.

131
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,397
Sheldon, I've been looking
over your transcripts

132
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,777
and I must say, I am very impressed.

133
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,501
Thank you.

134
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,285
What's your doctorate in?

135
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:42,205
Noncommutative Algebraic Topology.

136
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:45,275
I like her.

137
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,678
It's gonna be weird around
here without Sheldon.

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,446
Don't you mean less weird?

139
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,081
That's not nice.

140
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,316
I wasn't trying for nice.

141
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,686
You sure you're not jealous

142
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,119
'cause your little brother's
moving up in the world?

143
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,854
Hey, I got plans of my own.

144
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,823
Do tell. Soon as I graduate

145
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:02,859
high school, I'm gonna be
a professional male model.

146
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:05,128
That is hilarious.

147
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,029
What? I'm good-lookin'.

148
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,834
No, that you think you'll
graduate high school.

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,370
The model thing was funny, too.

150
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,505
I must tell you,

151
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:18,245
in all the years I've been
here, I have never seen

152
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,948
such glowing letters of recommendation

153
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,566
from a student's teachers.

154
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,292
- Well, that's real nice to hear.
- Now, listen to this:

155
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,483
"Putting aside his superior intellect,

156
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:29,129
Sheldon is a delight
to have in the class.

157
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:30,628
He's fun-loving,

158
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,989
easy to get along with,

159
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,917
and always ready to
help another student."

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,859
That doesn't sound like me at all.

161
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:37,127
Sure it does, sweetie.

162
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,295
Dr. Douglas...

163
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,063
Oh, no. Please call me Flora.

164
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,667
Flora, I have to ask about
the living arrangements.

165
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,163
That's our main concern.

166
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,169
Well, I think I can
reassure you about that.

167
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,172
My husband and I have
been hosting a student

168
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,664
for the last several years
who recently graduated

169
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,152
and is now at Princeton.

170
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:56,413
So we have a guest room
available in our home.

171
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,448
That's very generous of you.

172
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,450
Does your husband work
at the school also?

173
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:01,818
No, he's retired.

174
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,887
He was an astrophysicist for NASA.

175
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,822
Please tell me you don't have a dog.

176
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,624
No. We're both allergic.

177
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,293
I'm tingling.

178
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,766
Meemaw?

179
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,678
Meemaw.

180
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,339
W-Wow.

181
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,341
I know. I look great.

182
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,043
I got you a little going away gift.

183
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,344
Come on in.

184
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,513
This necklace has been

185
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,019
in our family for generations.

186
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,847
It belonged to a Comanche warrior

187
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,654
who gave it to your
great-great-great-great grandma.

188
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:38,955
Why'd he give it to her?

189
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,658
Well, according to family lore,

190
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,562
she was, uh, a very
accommodating young lady

191
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,664
and, uh, they hit it off.

192
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,132
That's a bird feather.

193
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,168
- Eagle feather.
- Doesn't matter.

194
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,437
I don't like birds, birds are filthy.

195
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,871
Okay.

196
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,163
Fine.

197
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,996
One featherless family heirloom

198
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,512
for you to take with you and
keep you safe while you're away.

199
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,982
You don't actually believe
this has magic powers, do you?

200
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:08,318
Oh, for God's sake,
just say "thank you."

201
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Thank you.

202
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,056
Mmm.

203
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,791
There's a price tag on it.

204
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,069
No, there's not.

205
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,373
Hello!

206
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,811
Anybody home?

207
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:31,214
Hi.

208
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:33,183
Mary.

209
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,652
He's gonna come home every Friday night.

210
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,821
I didn't think I'd
have to deal with this

211
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,723
till he went to college.

212
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:41,424
You should thank your lucky stars

213
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:44,260
he's not in college now.

214
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:47,597
I'm still not sure that this
is the right thing to do.

215
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,368
Are you worried that he won't like it

216
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,202
or are you worried that he will?

217
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:53,637
You're not helping.

218
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,438
That's not my job.

219
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,641
I think of myself as a speaker of truth.

220
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,133
If you're not gonna make
me feel better, go away.

221
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm sorry. You are stuck with me.

222
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,883
As you can see,

223
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:08,663
even as a small child,

224
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,766
people cherished having me around

225
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,047
and wept over my absence.

226
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,258
And no one took my
impending departure harder

227
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,428
than my best friend, Tam.

228
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,829
So you leave tomorrow?

229
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,504
Yes.

230
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,782
Dallas.

231
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:23,900
Yes.

232
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:24,934
Cool.

233
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,870
It was touching

234
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,836
to watch Tam bravely fight back tears.

235
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:34,244
Have you ever thought about
making the trains go clockwise?

236
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,246
No.

237
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:38,782
You should.

238
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:41,651
Brave, brave Tam.

239
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:53,876
You awake?

240
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,832
Yes.

241
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:59,302
Are you gonna miss me?

242
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:01,604
I haven't given it any thought.

243
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,501
Well, we're just lying here.

244
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:05,041
Think about it.

245
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,143
I am used to you.

246
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,012
I'm used to you, too.

247
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,548
It's not the same as liking you.

248
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,216
No.

249
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:16,300
To me, you're like string beans.

250
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,626
No one asks for them,

251
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,089
no one wonders about them.

252
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,824
They're just there on the plate.

253
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,059
But you eat them, right?

254
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,728
Yes.

255
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,082
You're gonna miss me.

256
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:46,254
All right, let's say grace.

257
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:48,691
Guess I get to hold hands with you now.

258
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,610
Guess so.

259
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,526
Maybe Sheldon's mittens
weren't such a bad idea.

260
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,595
Thank you, God, for
this food we are about

261
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:00,230
to receive and for the nourishment

262
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,498
of our bodies. And bless

263
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,066
the hands that prepared it.

264
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:07,270
And, God, we ask that you
watch over our Sheldon...

265
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:10,640
as he begins this wonderful new...

266
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,868
as he begins

267
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,001
this wonderful new chapter in his life.

268
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,784
- Amen.
- Amen.

269
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,385
Why you cryin'?

270
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:23,953
Why you stupid?

271
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,774
So how'd it go in Dallas today?

272
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:27,852
Went fine.

273
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:28,858
Nice people.

274
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,127
Sheldon seemed very comfortable
with the whole thing.

275
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,597
Welcome! How was the drive?

276
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:38,401
Eh, a little traffic comin'
into the city but otherwise okay.

277
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:41,337
Sheldon, I want you to
meet my husband, Elliot.

278
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,340
Elliot, this is Sheldon.

279
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,285
Well, it's nice to meet you, young man.

280
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,821
I've heard a lot about y.

281
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,199
George, that is not
at all how they were.

282
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:51,954
- What are you talking about?
- There was

283
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:54,094
definitely something
off about those people.

284
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,485
Really?

285
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,253
What'd I miss?

286
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,251
Welcome!

287
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,858
How was the drive?

288
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,329
Eh, a little traffic comin'
into the city but otherwise okay.

289
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,730
Sheldon,

290
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:11,868
I want you to meet my husband, Elliot.

291
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,238
Elliot, this is Sheldon.

292
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,141
Nice to meet you, young man.

293
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,469
I've heard a lot about you.

294
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:26,112
Oh, come on.

295
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,415
You're making it out like they
were some kind of monsters.

296
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,516
Sheldon has his own room.

297
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,633
There's books everywhere.

298
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,923
Even has a big old
backyard he won't play in.

299
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,725
Aren't you forgetting somethin'?

300
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:36,826
What?

301
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,728
The underground laboratory.

302
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,344
I think it's called

303
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,998
a finished basement, honey.

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,533
I know what I saw.

305
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,377
Mary, it's been a long day.

306
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,946
Can we just have a quiet dinner?

307
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,519
Sure.

308
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:52,876
"Nice people."

309
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:55,445
Then why did we leave him there?

310
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:58,769
Because we love him and
we want the best for him.

311
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,852
This is tense.

312
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,193
Me and the kids

313
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:11,688
had a nice day.

314
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,396
Watched a lot of football.

315
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,938
You know, the Dolphins'
helmet has a dolphin on it.

316
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,848
And that dolphin is
also wearing a helmet.

317
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,751
But his helmet doesn't
have a dolphin on it...

318
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:21,237
It has the letter "M."

319
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,277
We talked about that for an hour.

320
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,912
All right.

321
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,714
Dig in.

322
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,316
Excuse me.

323
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,149
Aren't we going to say grace?

324
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,954
Uh, we don't do that in our house.

325
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,023
Oh.

326
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,824
But you're welcome to do so.

327
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,313
That's all right. I
don't believe in God.

328
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,462
Well, then why would you say grace?

329
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,798
Because it makes my mom happy.

330
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,896
And why are you wearing mittens?

331
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,633
Well, I don't know where
your hands have been.

332
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,872
Okay.

333
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,922
Maybe we should just eat.

334
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:04,781
Do you like string beans?

335
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,684
No.

336
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,752
But I eat them.

337
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,438
Sheldon, can you hear me?

338
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:27,036
It's your twin sister, Missy.

339
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,977
Everything's all right here,

340
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,433
but I think Mom misses you real bad.

341
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:37,438
All right, I can't hear you,

342
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,915
so I'm gonna hang up now.

343
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,613
Good night.

344
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:45,488
I'm telling you, this
is a terrible idea.

345
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,118
- This is a terrible, terrible idea.
- He's gonna be fine.

346
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,255
- You'll see.
- I can't believe you're okay with this.

347
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,657
I'm not okay with this.

348
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,563
I'm just trying to be strong for you!

349
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,610
What? You thought him
leaving was a good idea.

350
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,935
Oh, I only said that because
you thought it was a bad idea.

351
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:01,782
You know how it's always my
nature to go the other way.

352
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:02,843
Say "up."

353
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:04,045
Up.

354
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,414
Down.

355
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,311
I'll see you in a bit.

356
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:09,746
Where are you off to?

357
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,180
I'm going to Dallas to get Sheldon.

358
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,065
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

359
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,602
What about this being a
great opportunity for him?

360
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,053
Y'all want me to go or not?

361
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,721
- Yes! Go!
- Yes, and hurry up!

362
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,356
Get a move on, Tubby.

363
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,969
Where you going?

364
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:22,992
To get Sheldon.

365
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,211
Do I get a vote in this?

366
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,328
No.

367
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,196
Dang.

368
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,586
Sleep didn't come easy that night,

369
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,667
knowing that, at any moment,

370
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,404
I could be decapitated.

371
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:36,665
And as if that wasn't bad enough,

372
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:39,418
the bed in my room had a dust ruffle,

373
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,321
which, to my young mind, only meant

374
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,649
one thing: there was dust.

375
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,416
But, eventually, I did drift off,

376
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,680
haunted by the memory,

377
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:52,008
the three of us
gathered around the piano

378
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,658
singing hippie folk music.

379
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,016
♪ You will not see nothin'
like the mighty Quinn ♪

380
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,172
Come on. Sing along now.

381
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,961
♪ Come all without ♪

382
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:05,568
- Ha! ♪ Come all within ♪
- ♪ Come all within ♪

383
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,897
♪ You will not see nothin'
like the mighty Quinn. ♪

384
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,235
"You'll not see nothin'."

385
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,546
Shame on whoever wrote that.

386
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,532
Dad?

387
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,333
Yeah?

388
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,569
I'm glad you came to get me.

389
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,371
Me, too.

390
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:51,647
No!

391
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,317
You got my message!

392
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,420
Hi-yah!

393
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:11,989
No hugging! No hugging!

394
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:17,852
I mean, why'd I bother
becoming a teacher?

395
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:20,027
He knows what I'm gonna
say before I say it.

396
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:22,463
- Or I say it and look like a dumbbell.
- Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:25,399
Ms. Ingram, can I offer a suggestion?

398
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,801
What?

399
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:29,519
- Never mind. You do it your way.
- No, no.

400
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,873
You tell me. Tell me how I'm wrong.

401
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,938
You assumed an extra
axiom of Euclidean geometry

402
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,310
without stating it.

403
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,880
Was he right?

404
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,348
Course he's right.

405
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,168
He's always right.

406
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,485
Tell you what I do.

407
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:45,953
I send him on little errands.

408
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:47,822
Like the other day, I told him,

409
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,892
"Go to the supply room
and get me a framastan."

410
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:52,636
What's a framastan?

411
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,005
No such thing. I made it up.

412
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:59,047
He was gone the whole period!

413
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,935
That's genius.

414
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,230
I'm using that.

415
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,739
Don't use framastan. That's mine.

416
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:07,975
What's going on here?

417
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:10,778
You said he was going away.

418
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,046
Liar.

419
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,814
It's 11:00 in the morning, guys.

420
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:21,892
