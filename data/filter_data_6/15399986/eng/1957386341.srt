1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
Come here, girl. Jess, Jess.

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
DOG BARKS

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
DOOR CHIMES

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
This way, Mrs Brompton.
Thank you.

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
To what do we owe the pleasure?

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
Well, it's that time of year.

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
Oh, the Daffodil Ball, I've been
counting the days.

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,360
And who's the lucky lass tonight?

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
Who can say at this point,
Mrs Brompton.

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Ah, Jim, Jim, perfect timing.

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,840
Ah, wallet!

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm sorry, what am I paying for now?

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
It's the Daffodil Ball tonight.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
All proceeds go towards the
restoration of the steeple.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
It's the highlight of the social
calendar.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
There'll be music, dancing, the
frisson of a warm spring evening.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
Mr Farnon not in?

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
He's yet to grace us
with his presence.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,600
How about it, Mrs Hall, a ticket
for you?

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Just four, please. Four?

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Yeah, need one for my date
for the evening.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Your date?

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,480
The day is young.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
Come on, Jim, no girl likes a
cheapskate.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Who's the extra one for?
Who do you think?

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,480
Time waits for no man, Jim lad, and
neither will Helen.

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
Morning, Mrs Brompton.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
Diana - please.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
How can we be of service?

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
Daffodil Ball.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
If you're not too busy I wondered

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
if we might lure you on to the dance
floor.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
Well, that depends what you're using
as bait.

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
SHE GIGGLES

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
Stop it.

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
It would be our pleasure to
support the cause.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,280
Tristan, money? Yeah.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,120
"Our pleasure" really?

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
And, uh, Mrs Hall, would you mind
showing Diana out?

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
Show her out?

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
We'll have to scrape her off him
first.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
This way.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,080
Swap. Thank you. Thank you,
bye-bye...

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,680
What?

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
What, is it?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,240
I mean, if you can't see, then

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,880
there's really no hope for you,
brother.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,560
If that woman were any more forward,
she'd be here yesterday.

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Nonsense, Diana's happily married.

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Isn't she?

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
Not any longer. Not for a year now.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Well, she was probably just
being friendly.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,040
You know, I heard he ran off with
the housekeeper.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
I heard the gardener.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
How did you get on with Merrick last
night?

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
I thought you were going to tag
that on to the end of your list.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Oh, James, you really can't allow
yourself to be so forgetful.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,880
The memory is a muscle that must be
exercised.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
I'll get up there right away.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,240
No, no, you've got a busy surgery
today.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
Here.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Organised as ever.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,760
Why doesn't Tristan stay
and help out?

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
With both examination rooms
in operation,

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
we'd get through them a lot quicker.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,440
I'd like to keep Tristan under my
wing for a while.

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,880
He's still got a lot to learn.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Go on, go and get ready.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr Farnon - postcard from Dorothy.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Who's the old Siegfried?

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
And why does she hope he gets out
from time to time?

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Sorry, I thought it were for me.

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
I didn't realise until it were too
late.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm sure.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
HORN BLARES

76
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
All right, all right, I'm coming.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,520
No Rover? Not today, it's leaking
oil everywhere.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Do your tie up, man, we must present
our very best self to our clients.

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
You know, you could do far worse
than Diana Brompton.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I see you got another postcard from
Dorothy.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
How's Malta?

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Hot and rocky.

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
She's looking forward to becoming a
grandmother.

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Shame, I got the impression you were
rather fond of her.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, hang on, hang on, slow down,
slow down.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,680
Stop.

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Morning, Helen.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,520
All right, Triss, Siegfried.

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
What can I do for you?

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, it's not me, actually.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
Um, I think James wanted to see
you about something.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,720
He's at the house if you wanted to
pop in.

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
Right.

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
Thanks.

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Bye. BOTH: Bye.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
Helen. Hello.

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
Please, come in, come in.

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Come on through.

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,520
There we are.

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
OK, then...

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
..how can I help?

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
I thought you wanted to see me.

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
You did? I mean, I do. Why wouldn't
I?

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course I'd like to see you...

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Right.

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Only, I've got to get back and put
our carrots in, so, shall we?

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,680
Sorry, shall we what?

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,400
The reason you wanted to see me.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm not sure I understand -
you came here.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
Because Tristan asked me to.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
Ah.

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,360
He said you wanted to speak to me
about something.

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm sure he did.

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,400
Well...

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Triss and I are going to the
Daffodil Ball.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
And I couldn't be happier for you.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
Oh, no, no, he's not...
Not together.

118
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
I mean, well, we are but not...

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
James, it's fine...

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,640
..you have my blessings.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,360
See, because of that...

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
..now I'm not inviting you.

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,320
I had a spare ticket but I'll just
have to give it to someone else.

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
Probably for the best.

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,440
I haven't really been out since...

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
..well...

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
No-one will care.

128
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
We'll go as a group, you, me,
Triss...

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
..whoever he manages to drag along.

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm a terrible dancer,

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,000
so that amusement alone is a good
enough reason to come.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
I don't know.

133
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
DOOR CHIMES

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
It's my dog.

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
He disappeared yesterday
evening on one of our walks.

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,920
I found him when I went back out
again this morning,

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,360
he must've been in this
trap all night.

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Well, bring him through.

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,160
James!

140
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
DOG WHINES

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,120
I need you!

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't worry, go.

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
We need to get him something for the
pain and sedated right away.

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
What's his name? It's Rock.

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,320
Mrs Hall, pass the cotton wool,
please.

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
You'll be able to save him,
won't you?

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
I can't tell.

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,800
I won't be able to tell you
until I've explored the wound.

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Who would do such a thing?

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,360
It's monstrous.

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,880
Oh, it looks a mess.

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,640
I won't know until I'm right
inside how bad it is.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,840
What I'd do for an X-ray machine
now.

154
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
Doesn't seem natural, being able to

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
see your insides on the outside like
that.

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,080
They're an incredible diagnostic
tool.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,160
All right, he's asleep.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,320
I don't think the leg's broken.

159
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,400
We better hope there's still some
circulation to the paw.

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
And if there's not?

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm afraid he'll lose the foot.

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Colonel, good morning.

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Now, then, Farnon, what's all this
about?

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
We were expecting you last night.

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, I'm afraid, there was
something

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
of an administrative balls up.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
My colleague missed you off his
list.

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh, and there I was believing I was
one of your most valued clients.

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh, I'm almost hurt.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
Rest assured, you have my undivided
attention now.

171
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
Bag please, Tristan.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Yes, err, unfortunately, I've

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
had to find another dance partner.

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Sorry to say, too little, too late,
old chap.

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,680
Still, there's, there's nothing like
a bit of healthy

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,960
competition to keep you on your
toes, hey, Farnon?

177
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
Indeed.

178
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
George, what a qualified pleasure it
is to see you.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
HE LAUGHS

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
Now, now, chaps, we mustn't
squabble.

181
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
I'd hate to be the bone between a
pair of scrapping dogs.

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
If you're finding yourself
unable to cope,

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
I could always take a few more
clients off your hands.

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm perfectly capa... More than
capable, thank you.

185
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, there's no shame in admitting
you can't keep up.

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
The years are rolling on.

187
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
Ha-ha, the coup de grace.

188
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Until next time, Hubert.

189
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,840
Rolling on? You're rolling on.

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
He's older than I am.

191
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
Still, since you've come all this
way,

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,000
there's no harm in you casting
an expert eye over her.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
I imagine there wouldn't be a

194
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
charge - on account of all the
bother.

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,120
No, of course not, Hubert...

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
..anything for our most valued
customer.

197
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
I've asked this morning's clients to
come back this afternoon.

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
I don't understand why Siegfried
doesn't let Tristan run surgery.

199
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,880
If there were two of us, we wouldn't
have to send anyone away.

200
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Mr Farnon has his ways...

201
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,080
..maddening as they might be.

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
It's best to let sleeping dogs lie.
Mm.

203
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm not sure I'd describe Siegfried
as a sleeping dog.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
Thanks.

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
How's he getting on?

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
I'd like to be able to give
Mr Hammond some good news.

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,840
I don't think the bone is broken.

208
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
We need to hope it's not infected.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,880
Seems like a nice chap.

210
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
He does.

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
He is.

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,400
I better get a brew on before he
wears a hole in the floor.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,480
I'll do the best I can.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
102.5.

215
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
Stethoscope.

216
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,240
Thank you, Tristan.

217
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
Pandhi said her insides are blocked
up,

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
gave her some linseed oil to
grease the wheels.

219
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
Really?

220
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Well, that's one way of doing it,
I suppose.

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
And that's not the treatment you'd
prescribe?

222
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Well, we all have our different
approaches, Colonel.

223
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,160
And different degrees of success
that go with them.

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,200
COW MOOS

225
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Yes, I thought so.

226
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
You're struggling, aren't you, old
girl?

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Stomach powders. Coming right up.

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm afraid there's definitely
a blockage.

229
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
It could be she's had too much
roughage and that's bunged

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,320
her up or there could be a wire or
something else caught up inside.

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, it sounds serious.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
More common than you'd think.

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,960
Did Pandhi not mention the
possibility?

234
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,720
I told my stock man to wait for you,
Farnon.

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
Lesson learned.

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,520
We'll start off with the powders to
help her work it through and

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,640
if that doesn't shift it, I'm afraid
we'll have to come back and operate.

238
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
COW MOOS

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Mr Hammond?

240
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, noticed the timing's off.

241
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
Well, I put it forward every
morning.

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,880
Well, I could fix it for you, if you
like?

243
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh, I've got used to it now.

244
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Sometimes I put it forward more
than I should

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,440
to get them out the house sooner.

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
Well...

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,520
..there speaks a woman wise to the
world.

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Wise to the lot I've been lumbered
with, certainly.

249
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Sorry, I've never been good at
waiting for news,

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
I have to keep myself busy.

251
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
You and me both.

252
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Mr Herriot is a wonderful vet.

253
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
If you want any more milk, you just
let me know.

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
I will.

255
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm sorry, in the rush,
I didn't catch your name.

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
It's...

257
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,640
..Audrey.

258
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,960
Gerald.

259
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Sugar, I forgot the sugar.

260
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll just, um.

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,840
No, no, I can leave that.

262
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,440
And I'll come back with your, uh...

263
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
..with the, um... Sugar.

264
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
That's the chap.

265
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
What's this? It's the list.

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
The list, man. Don't look like that,
tell me what's next. Oh.

267
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
Mr Dinsdale.

268
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,480
Ah, yes, sow, aural haematoma.

269
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
See? All up here.

270
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Why would you have Merrick
written twice?

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
Well, I wouldn't.

272
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Unless this was left in your pocket
from last night.

273
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,480
Which would suggest you were
supposed

274
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
to go to Merrick's and not James?

275
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,760
What're you doing?

276
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,680
We must present our best self for
the clients, Siegfried.

277
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,920
Morning.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh, we thought it'd be a grand
adventure...

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
..too young to know any better.

280
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
You were in good company.

281
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
I should never have been there in
the first place,

282
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,960
I lied to the recruiting officer
about my age.

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh, God, you were one of those...

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,280
..king, country.

285
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
The usual nonsense.

286
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,880
You know, funny thing is...

287
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,720
..I wouldn't change it for the
world.

288
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,120
Even though it left me hobbling
about.

289
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The struggle makes everything all
the more worth it.

290
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,840
I'll keep telling myself that.

291
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,360
Mr Hammond, you can come through.

292
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,200
Thank you for the tea.

293
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,920
We've patched him up.

294
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm worried there could be an
infection,

295
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,360
the wound must've been open for some
time.

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,480
If it spreads, it could poison the
blood stream.

297
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
And then what?

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,280
There's still a chance he could lose
the leg.

299
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
Hm, better that than his life.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
Leave him with us for a few days.

301
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
Hey, you'll be all right, Rock, lad.

302
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,960
This nice gentleman and kind lady
are going to take care of you.

303
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
And Jess will keep him company.

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,720
Will we be seeing you at the dance
then?

305
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,040
God willing.

306
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
So long as you fulfil your
professional obligations first.

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
And, by God, I naturally mean my
brother.

308
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Them eggs will not collect
themselves, you know.

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,560
Should have kept her locked in
the coal shed.

310
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
Our little Buttercup's in here.

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Now, that boil on her noggin's even
bigger than last time you were up.

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,320
I didn't have the correct instrument
to complete the procedure.

313
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Here's our little lass now.

314
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

315
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Oh, yes ,I can see from here the
haematoma's even more engorged.

316
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,960
Ah, looks fit to burst.

317
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,120
I thought about going in and having
a go myself, like...

318
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,720
..not for very long, mind.

319
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes, well, it's becoming apparent to
me

320
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
now why you might have left your
scalpel at home last time.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
Thankfully, I believe we have it
here today. Mm.

322
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,320
I don't know why you're
handing that to me,

323
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,080
we learn by doing, little brother.

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,040
I imagine she's called Buttercup
because uh...

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
..well, despite appearances, she's
a tender and sweet soul at heart?

326
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Not as it goes.

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,560
Nearly took me finger off once.

328
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,840
If she gets hold of you, my advice
is to play dead.

329
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
Unless you think she might actually
kill you,

330
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
in which case, don't...

331
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,440
..play dead, I mean.

332
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Right.

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
Siegfried? Come now, Tristan.

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
It's alright to be frightened,
for without fear,

335
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,680
there cannot be courage.

336
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,960
Ha, without courage, there can't be
pain.

337
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
# I'm called Little Buttercup

338
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,280
# Dear Little Buttercup. #

339
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Try not to startle it!

340
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
Forget the pig, you startled me!

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,240
Good Buttercup.

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Good pig.

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,680
Oh, God!

345
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,920
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

346
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Oh, ah.

347
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
Mr Dinsdale, I fear we may have to
return with anaesthetic

348
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
to tame the beast before we operate.

349
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, aye, when would that be then?

350
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,240
Oh, not until this evening. What?

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
No, Siegfried, we can't come back.

352
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,680
Look, we're here now, I'll do it
now.

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,640
He's either very brave or very
stupid.

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,000
I believe it's a heady mixture of
both.

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,440
No courage without fear.

356
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,040
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

357
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
Good God!

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
I admire your persistence

359
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,240
but sometimes discretion is
the better part of valour.

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
He's done it.

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,760
I'll be damned.

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
I did?

363
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
I mean, yes, I did.

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes, well, you made a bit of meal of
it but you got there in the end.

365
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,520
Maybe I'll, uh, see you later.

366
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,400
Tristan, it's this way.

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,480
Frowning at it won't change it.

368
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,960
It's from a friend of my mum's.

369
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,640
He owns a vet's practice in Glasgow.
Hm.

370
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,520
They've offered me a job.

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Well, I'm not surprised.

372
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
Who wouldn't want you working for
them?

373
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Mum seems to have accepted it for
me.

374
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,400
Oh, dear.

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
The practice is run by a man
called Bill Weipers.

376
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,320
He's on the board at Glasgow
Veterinary College.

377
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
He employs modern methods
and equipment.

378
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
He has an immaculate practice,

379
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,480
sterile examination rooms, nurses,

380
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
X-ray machine.

381
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,760
And you got lumbered with us lot.

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
well, it's just a different...

383
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
..very different way of working.

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
If you ever have any ideas about how

385
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,320
you might improve this place,

386
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
I'm sure Mr Farnon would hear you
out.

387
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,360
If you catch him on a good day,
perhaps.

388
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,640
It's more complicated than
that, Dad's struggling to get work.

389
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,280
They're really struggling to
make ends meet.

390
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,880
Well, they'd want you to be happy.

391
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,520
As a parent, that's all you want for
your children.

392
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,680
It feels so selfish.

393
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
They spent their life savings
putting

394
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
me through college, I owe it to
them.

395
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,840
How long have you got to decide?

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,080
I've got a few months to work out

397
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,840
if there's something here worth
staying for.

398
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,200
Or someone?

399
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,840
Helen took the other one.

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
How many cases have we got to get
through this afternoon?

401
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
16.

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,280
We'll use both examination rooms.

403
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,240
While I'm treating an animal in
one...

404
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
I'll settle the next one into the
other room.

405
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Once I've finished treatment, you
show them out, settle up the bill.

406
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,040
I'll go straight through to deal
with the next. Righto.

407
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
Hello, there.

408
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
Hello.

409
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
Good afternoon. Mr Herriot.

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
Afternoon. Hello.

411
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
Right, Mrs Kirkby, with a rabbit.

412
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
That's me.

413
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
Lovely.

414
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
Miss Fearnly? Yes, lovely.

415
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
Would you like to come through?

416
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
Thank you, Mrs Jackson.

417
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,920
Keep George warm by the fire,
that'll help speed up the waking
process.

418
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
Thank you, love.

419
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
It's Anne with Susie.
I'll be with you in a second.

420
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
And don't you look happy about it.

421
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Sorry, I've been rushed off my feet.

422
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,000
Hello, Susie.

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
How're you getting on with those
pups of yours?

424
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,120
They're all grand.

425
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,240
First one you got out's
biggest of the lot.

426
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
We named him James.

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
I'll have to come up and visit him.

428
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
Don't worry, Susie. Hey, we just
need to check how you're getting on.

429
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,440
BELL RINGS

430
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Excuse me. Come on through.

431
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Hi, Helen. Hi.

432
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,440
You look...

433
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,520
It's good to see you.

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
Shall I come in?

435
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
Yes ,of course.

436
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm just finishing up, I won't be
long, I swear.

437
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,280
She won't mind waiting.

438
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,920
Oh, hello.

439
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
Tea? I think so.

440
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Oh, you've certainly put
the weight back on.

441
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,280
Sorry, Susie.

442
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,200
That's very rude of me, isn't it?

443
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
You know, if ever you're to get
beyond smiling at the girl...

444
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
..you might eventually have to do
something about it.

445
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,760
What happened to the other one?
What?

446
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
I thought we could chat.

447
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,400
Um..

448
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
..yeah, great, OK.

449
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,520
The other one, the barmaid,
Margaret?

450
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,040
Maggie? I suppose she got sick of
you.

451
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,440
Yeah, the thing about Maggie and me
is we're like ships in the night.

452
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,800
Travelling our own separate
courses...

453
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
..occasionally we...

454
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,840
..crash into one another during
stormy weather.

455
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
Meanwhile, you happily flit...

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,360
..courting one girl and then the
next.

457
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
First of all - no-one courts.

458
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,480
Then what are they doing?
They date.

459
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
We're not Americans.

460
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
The world's changing.

461
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
Not every evening spent in the
company of a woman

462
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,840
necessarily has to end in something
particularly meaningful.

463
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,520
In fact, most often it necessarily
doesn't.

464
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,120
Then what's the point of it all?

465
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,040
Fun.

466
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,360
I understand that's a very alien
concept to you.

467
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,680
I am fun, I'm perfectly bloody fun.

468
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
You certainly used to be.

469
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Now I don't know what's happened.
What's that supposed to mean?

470
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
You didn't used to be like this.

471
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Like what?

472
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
Allowing Merrick to get a free
ride...

473
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
..letting Pandhi rattle you and...

474
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,320
..don't even get me started on the
women.

475
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Well, I imagine the problem's
getting you to stop.

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,880
There's no spirit, the fight's gone.

477
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,080
I assure you, it has not.
Really?

478
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,960
Cos in the not too distant past,
you would've tackled that sow

479
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
without a moment's hesitation,

480
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
just to show people that you could.

481
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm not saying you're past it but...
You just did!

482
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
Stuck in a rut maybe, one that I
thought Dorothy

483
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
had got you out of it but...

484
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm not in a rut, there is no bloody
rut!

485
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Oh, I'll get that for you.

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Bye. Bye.

487
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,320
Good evening, good evening, Mrs
Hall, Helen, a delight as ever.

488
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
What happened to you?

489
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Fight with a pig.

490
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Is it hard to believe
I actually won?

491
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,720
Bring your muddy things down,

492
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,920
don't leave them festering on the
floor.

493
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
It's been a long day.

494
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
You must barely recognise me.

495
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,480
Oh, I don't know Siegfried,

496
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,680
I think you've weathered rather
well.

497
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
You're very kind.

498
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
How've you been?

499
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,040
You know, one foot in front of the
other.

500
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
Glad to hear it.

501
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
There you are, James.

502
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,920
About bloody time, poor Helen's
being bored silly waiting.

503
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm fine, Mrs Hall's been looking
after me.

504
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
I had an emergency case,

505
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
I've been playing catch up all day.

506
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,280
You should really learn to deal
with these cases.

507
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,800
No wonder we're struggling
to turn a profit.

508
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,080
I would say, Siegfried,
if Tristan were here today,

509
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,000
there would've been no need to
send anyone away.

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,320
I want him with me until he's served
some time under my supervision.

511
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
He's more than capable.

512
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh, see how they shower me with
praise?

513
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Perhaps this could wait for another
time?

514
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,200
No, if James has got something he
wants

515
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
to get off his chest, I'd like to
hear it.

516
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,920
If Tristan were able to practise on
his own, we could take on more work.

517
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,640
With the extra money, maybe we could
change a few things around here.

518
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
Change? Why on earth would
we want to change?

519
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,720
We could be working much more
efficiently,

520
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
half of our equipment
is from the last century.

521
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,920
So am I! Should we just toss me
out as well?

522
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't think James means that.

523
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Of course I don't.

524
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
Siegfried, I learned more from you
in a year

525
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
than I did in all the time I spent
at college.

526
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,520
You flatter to deceive.

527
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,000
It's true...

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
..he told me as much before.

529
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,760
I just want to be able to offer the
best care possible to our patients.

530
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Of course, as do I.

531
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800
You know I'm always open to new
ideas.

532
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
HE CHUCKLES

533
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
What?

534
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
I am.

535
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,640
Did you know we were the first
practice in whole of Yorkshire

536
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
to have our own centrifuge for TB
testing?

537
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,600
And I always put us forward
for the trial of new medications.

538
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,160
We are a forward looking practice.

539
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,400
And I am one who always looks ahead,
rather than behind - always.

540
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,240
Semper progrediens!

541
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
Always progressing. I know.

542
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,240
Good. Well, that all seems settled
then.

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,440
Now, shouldn't you be going before
something or other

544
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
turns into a pumpkin?

545
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Semper progrediens!

546
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,800
I believe he's fighting the
inevitable march of time.

547
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
Oh, Lord help us.

548
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
Go on, get on with you, I've my book
to read.

549
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
James...

550
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,640
..good luck.

551
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
You sure you won't come?

552
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
Oh, it's not for me.

553
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,800
Listen to that, Jess.

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
Isn't that wonderful?

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
You'll be fine.

556
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,520
Dorothy happen to mention
when she'll be returning?

557
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,320
She has no plans at the moment.

558
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Oh, and how do you feel about that?

559
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,520
How do I feel?

560
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,320
When you care about someone very
much, you...

561
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,960
People have these things,
feelings, emotions.

562
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,280
Dorothy's a good friend - nothing
more.

563
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,400
Understood.

564
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
Well, then...

565
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,880
..without fear...

566
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
There can be no courage.

567
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Once more unto the breach.

568
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
Diana.

569
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
Good evening. Good evening to
you.

570
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
You're looking stunning. Thank you.

571
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,000
How many do you think he'll
dance with tonight?

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,680
I've a feeling that once she gets a
hold of him...

573
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,040
..she won't be letting go.

574
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,960
My mum used to make me
go to tea dances with her.

575
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,440
It used to be me and a room full of
old ladies.

576
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,400
Mum used to make me stand up in
front of all of them

577
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
and request songs from the singer.

578
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,200
She didn't? I had to dance with
her...

579
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,680
..and all her friends.

580
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,360
That's why I find it the most
embarrassing

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
thing in the world to do.

582
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,920
It's probably why I'm terrible at
it.

583
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
Oh, James, stop it.

584
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
You're just saying it to make me
feel better.

585
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,880
So, I apologise in advance for the
absolute shambles

586
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
this'll inevitably be

587
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
but would you like to dance?

588
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,560
I promise once people see me
out there,

589
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,400
no-one is going to be talking
about your wedding with Hugh.

590
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
You'd really do that?

591
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,200
You'd make a complete fool out of
yourself for me?

592
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
Every single day.

593
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
No Maggie tonight, then?

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,760
No, no, boyfriend. Her, not me.

595
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
That were very clever of you,

596
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,520
tricking that pig in to bursting its
own bubble.

597
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,760
There'd be some who'd mistake
it for you running away.

598
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes, well, it often takes brains
as well

599
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,680
as brawn to solve these problems.

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,840
Hm, I'd settle for a pretty face.

601
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,480
How about it, then?

602
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, sadly, Anabel, I'm just not
one of life's dancers.

603
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,600
Oh, that's handy...

604
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
..because I'm not one for dancing
either.

605
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
Outstanding.

606
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
I've no idea what I'm doing.

607
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
Don't worry, you're doing fine.

608
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
Ooh. Sorry.

609
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,560
It's alright, I've got another one.

610
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,520
Look, try and loosen up, let
yourself go with it.

611
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,040
That's it, that's better.

612
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,720
Ooh!

613
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,480
That's a little too much.

614
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
I was sorry to hear about you
and your husband.

615
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Which was it, the housekeeper or the
gardener?

616
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh, I don't hold for such
tittle-tattle.

617
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
Both, actually.

618
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
I wouldn't blame him if it was the
gardener - he was quite the dish.

619
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,600
There's even one going round

620
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
where I've got old Len buried in the
basement.

621
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,360
That's why no-one's seen him
for so long.

622
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,880
I don't mind that one so much,

623
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
it keeps everybody on their toes.

624
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,960
Farnon, we've got ourselves a bit of
a problem.

625
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, Colonel, I believe we have.

626
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,560
I was in the middle of a charming
conversation with

627
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,840
this young lady and I've been rudely
interrupted.

628
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,280
I beg your pardon?

629
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
You can beg all you like,
you're not having it.

630
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Now, if you'll excuse me.

631
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
You see, Colonel, what did I tell
you?

632
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
He's lost it.

633
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,640
I do apologise, Diana.

634
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,280
Oh, no need.

635
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,200
I love a bit of drama.

636
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,760
Now hear this, Farnon, that cow is
still unwell.

637
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,120
You told me it needed an operation.

638
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
If you're not willing to come up
and sort her...

639
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
..well, I can always take my custom
elsewhere.

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Custom suggests a transfer of money
for services rendered.

641
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,560
I put a lot of work your way.

642
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,480
Because we're the finest in the
district.

643
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,720
We've three qualified vets and
enough work

644
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,560
to necessitate the expansion of our
practice.

645
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,280
We don't have to fight like jackals
over scraps left by others.

646
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,440
If you really want the best possible
care for your animals,

647
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,880
you can call during our normal
business hours.

648
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,560
Otherwise, go with the reserve team.

649
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,520
Good evening.

650
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,280
Good evening? I'll give you good
evening!

651
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,120
That was very impressive.
Thank you.

652
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,560
Where are we going?

653
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
No idea, I always like to sweep
out at the end of an argument.

654
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,840
But since we're on the move, might I
suggest somewhere more salubrious?

655
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
The Renniston, perhaps? Why not?

656
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,240
Sorry again about your toes.

657
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Oh, it was great.

658
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,600
You were great.

659
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,240
It's been so long since...

660
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,640
I really needed that.

661
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm glad.

662
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,440
I'll, er, I'll fetch our drinks.

663
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,120
Don't forget to come up for air.

664
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Goodnight, Tristan.

665
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,680
Helen, been awhile. How've you been?

666
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, not bad. You?

667
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
Oh, same as always...

668
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,600
What do you say then, lass,
Fancy a turn around the floor?

669
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,760
Oh, Fernley, this is... Hello.

670
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm James Herriot.

671
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
Right, nice.

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,200
I didn't mean to... If you two are
together, then.

674
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Us? Oh, no, we're not.

675
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,360
Are we? No, not at all.

676
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
Only, we were known to have the odd
dance in the past.

677
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
We even won a show together.

678
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,400
Go on, at least he won't stand on
your toes.

679
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
Right.

680
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,120
Really, no trouble.

681
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
Enjoy yourself.

682
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Thanks, James.

683
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,520
Idiot.

684
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
Tea, Siegfried?

685
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,880
If you wouldn't mind, Tristan,

686
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,800
thank you, very kind.

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320
When. Bless you.

688
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,920
Good evening? Oh, very much so.

689
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
How long's this going to go on for?
What?

690
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,640
The inane expressions...

691
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
..the smug sense of satisfaction.

692
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,320
Mrs Hall, I would've thought
you'd be glad

693
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
to hear we enjoyed ourselves last
night.

694
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,440
Oh, it's enough to put me off my
breakfast.

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,920
What about James?

696
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,720
Did he enjoy himself?

697
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,400
PHONE RINGS

698
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
Darrowby, two, two, nine, seven.

699
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
One moment.

700
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
Mr Farnon.

701
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
Colonel Merrick.

702
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes, what, is it?

703
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,160
Oh, you do?

704
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,240
Yes, well, I'll have to consult our
appointment diary first.

705
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Three o'clock?

706
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
Breakfast's on the table.

707
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,720
I'll be there in a minute.

708
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,760
SIEGFRIED: See you then.

709
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,040
How'd it go?

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,680
He's doing all right, temperature's
down.

711
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,000
The infection is starting
to clear up.

712
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,320
You can call Mr Hammond and tell him
to pick him up later.

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
That's not what I meant.

714
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Oh, love.

715
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
It's alright.

716
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,120
There are a lot of people Helen
needs to catch up with.

717
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
SIEGFRIED: Herriot!

718
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,080
Tristan!

719
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm literally three feet away from
you.

720
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't understand why you
have to bellow.

721
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Don't be such a sensitive Sidney.
Here.

722
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I've been keeping these back, one
each.

723
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,960
And what are these for?

724
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,840
You said you wanted us to modernise,
James?

725
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,120
We're about to give the good Colonel
a show he'll never forget.

726
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,720
Morning, Colonel.

727
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,880
No Pandhi today?

728
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,440
You're our vet, Farnon, for now, at
any rate.

729
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,440
Well, I'm glad we managed to squeeze
you in.

730
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Yes, prepare the patient
for the operation.

731
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
COW MOOS

732
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
Thank you.

733
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
Right. This is where we go in.

734
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
I hope you aren't squeamish,
it's not for the faint hearted.

735
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
I've seen blood before, you needn't
worry, I shan't faint.

736
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,920
Now, you see the rumen exposed,
the cow's first stomach,

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,840
you know they have four?

738
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,680
Hang on Farnon, that doesn't look
too clever.

739
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,520
Um, yes, it's probably just
a bit of ruminal gas.

740
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,600
Wouldn't you say?

741
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,080
Aye, probably.

742
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,200
James, could I borrow you for a
second?

743
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,640
Farnon, what was it you said,
the finest vet in the district?

744
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,360
You're putting on a right show, now.

745
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
Siegfried, do you not think
the good Colonel could

746
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,840
benefit from seeing some of your
handiwork up close?

747
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,280
You know, you really are full
of good ideas at the moment, James.

748
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Yes, Colonel, come in.

749
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,200
Come in, that's it.

750
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,800
That's it, a little closer.

751
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
Scalpel, please.

752
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,640
There we are. Thank you.

753
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,000
Ready, Colonel?

754
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,840
Oh, get on with it, Farnon.

755
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,880
Oh, oh.

756
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,000
COLONEL MERRICK: Absolutely...

757
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,480
That's what the problem was. What do
you make of that?

758
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,240
Farnon, what the...
It's Mr Farnon...

759
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,120
..and my bill will be in the post.

760
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,720
Well, I thought that went rather
well. Mm.

761
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,160
Absolutely. Quite the show.
Text book.

762
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,840
COLONEL MERRICK: God, absolutely
covered in the stuff.

763
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
You'll have to keep him inside for a
few days

764
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,720
to keep the wound clean.

765
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,960
But I'm pleased with how the
infection is clearing up.

766
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,440
Well, we can't thank you enough,
Mr Herriot.

767
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,000
No trouble at all.

768
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
Mrs Hall will show you out.

769
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,920
Come on, then, Rock, here we go.

770
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,440
It looks like these two have
become firm friends.

771
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,840
Oh, we'll be sorry to see him go.
Won't we, Jess?

772
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm sure they could see each other
again.

773
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
We could take them for a walk
together.

774
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,480
One of the men usually take Jess
out.

775
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,840
Ah, well, never mind.

776
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,680
Maybe we'll see you out
and about, hey, Jess.

777
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
When you grow tired of moving
your clock forward,

778
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,120
let me know and I'll come fix it.

779
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
Lost time is never found again.

780
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
Come on, Rock, let's go.

781
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,040
Oh, hold on.

782
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,640
Oh, Helen, love, good to see you.

783
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,800
Is James about?

784
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,680
In there.

785
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
Come in.

786
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm just clearing up, won't be a
second.

787
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
Sorry we lost each other last night.

788
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
Oh, it's fine, don't worry.

789
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,960
It's been so long since I caught up
with everyone.

790
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,360
I've known most of them since we
were kids.

791
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,080
Oh, it's all right, I understand.

792
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,080
It was the same for me when I went
home, seeing everyone again.

793
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,720
It feels strange hearing you call
somewhere else home.

794
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,320
You belong here.

795
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,000
This is your home.

796
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,560
I looked for you last night,
couldn't find you?

797
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,320
I got dragged into a conversation
outside

798
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,000
with Gene Gilbert and
Mr Summers.

799
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Once they get their teeth in,
they're hard to shake off.

800
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
I would've liked to have danced with
you again.

801
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,040
If your toes could take it.

802
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Last night were the first time in a
long time

803
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,120
that I've felt like myself again...

804
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
..and I was only there because of
you.

805
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,760
Everything all right with
Miss Alderson?

806
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,400
Aye, grand.

807
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
Everything's grand.
