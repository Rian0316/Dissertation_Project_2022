1
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,299
Cranford's giving you a look.

2
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,699
There. Go and have a look.
Go and have a look.

3
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,819
I don't know why. I saved a cow
of his last week.

4
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:51,939
Poor thing had colic.

5
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,539
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,859
It says eight o'clock on there.

7
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,819
Quite exciting.

8
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,059
Hello! Hello.

9
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,939
Thank you.

10
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,099
And then a gasp of
amazement and satisfaction

11
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,619
runs around the world.

12
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,859
The Prime Minister decides to fly
to a personal meeting

13
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,299
with the German Chancellor,
so after 69 years of a busy life,

14
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:58,619
Mr Chamberlain makes his first
trip in a plane.

15
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,259
There's proof of his determination.

16
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,699
The German Chancellor

17
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,659
regards the situation,

18
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,459
it seems to me, to be one in which
discussions between him and me

19
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,499
It'll get sorted.

20
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,099
..may have useful consequences.

21
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,219
Are your parents
still coming down to see you?

22
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,059
The day after tomorrow.
They can only stay the one night.

23
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,979
Hello.

24
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,019
She's dead.

25
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,179
Dead?

26
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,939
Aye, she is. Dead.

27
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,219
Not her!

28
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,019
Me cow, you silly beggar!

29
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,979
I am sorry about that.

30
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,019
And I don't think it was owt to do
with her stomach, neither.

31
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,139
Sorry.

32
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,659
And...

33
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,259
And here's another thing,

34
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,899
you never sent me
that salve you promised me either.

35
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,899
What do you think?

36
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,579
That it's beyond saving.

37
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,459
I thought I'd
get in for your parents.

38
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,219
They're still stopping by tomorrow?

39
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,219
Is there any more mustard?

40
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,459
You've got legs.

41
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,259
They're welcome to stay, you know.

42
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,099
It's no bother making up
another bed.

43
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,659
They've got the inn booked.
They didn't want to impose.

44
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,139
Has your mum got any idea you're
not coming back?

45
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,339
I didn't want to do it
over the phone.

46
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,179
With everything else going on in
the world, maybe she'll mind less.

47
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,619
What's this?

48
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,419
Oh, just...looking to the future,

49
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,459
making decisions.

50
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,539
I'm still thinking about it. You're
a good vet. There's only one exam.

51
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,019
I can help you revise if you like.
Aw.

52
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,699
My gallant crew, good morning!

53
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,659
An enjoyable evening with Diana?
Mind your beeswax!

54
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,579
Oh, God, man, you smell like
a tart's handbag!

55
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,259
Parma Violet, if I'm not mistaken.

56
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,499
I wondered where my bath salts
had gone!

57
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,339
Oh, he had a rough time of it
last night. Oh, aye.

58
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,259
I was at the cinema with Helen...
I'll get it.

59
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,939
..but Cranford wouldn't stop
going on about some bloody salve.

60
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,059
I'll do it.

61
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,259
It would have been nice to have
one night out with Helen

62
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,299
that didn't end in disaster.

63
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,499
When are you going to stop this
nonsense and get wed?

64
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,939
Why are you laughing?

65
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,459
You're not serious, are you?

66
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:23,899
But I've no money, no house.
Where would we live?

67
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,099
Here, of course. With Tristan
sleeping in the cupboard?

68
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,699
I wouldn't mind waking up
to Helen...

69
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,699
Sorry, that's inappropriate!
But it's true.

70
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,499
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;

71
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,539
And this same flower that smiles
today, tomorrow will be dying.

72
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,699
I'm not getting married!

73
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,459
You're getting married?!
I'm not!

74
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,219
Caution - often a virtue,
but you carry it too far.

75
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,659
You need to take a chance,
lash out a little.

76
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,899
Carpe some diem! Throw off these
hesitant ways

77
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,059
and, remember, there is a tide
in the affairs of men

78
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,259
which taken at the flood...

79
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,619
Yes, Siegfried, all right,
all right.

80
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,179
Stop it. Who was on the phone?

81
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,179
Mrs Dalby. She wants you to look
over her stirks.

82
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,539
Why aren't you off to school yet?

83
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,379
I just wanted to see about the cows.

84
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,819
Billy Francis Dalby, if you're not
on your bike this second...

85
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,979
Mum!

86
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,299
You must be proud of him.

87
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,659
Oh, I am that.

88
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,459
Now, I know you told me not to put
them out again,

89
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,259
but we worked through the hay
so fast,

90
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,099
I couldn't afford to keep feeding
them cake.

91
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,499
I can see they've been suffering
with diarrhoea.Yeah.

92
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,499
It seems to have happened
within a few days.

93
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,019
Maybe it's something they've eaten.

94
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,419
You have any idea what it might be?

95
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,939
There's a few possibilities.

96
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,379
The most troubling is it could
be salmonella.

97
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,779
Right.

98
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,659
Let's wait until we know before
we start worrying.

99
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,619
I'll take some samples,
get them analysed,

100
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,659
and by tomorrow, we'll know what
we're dealing with.

101
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,299
I sometimes wonder...

102
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,579
..maybe we'd be better off
if I'd just listened to you

103
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,379
and sold up whilst we still had
the chance.

104
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,179
You kept the farm for Billy,
to give him hope, a future.

105
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,419
Oh, we spent all that money
on cake as well.

106
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,419
We need to wait for the results
and then we'll deal with it.

107
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,419
So let's stop all this talk about
moving on.

108
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,859
Your life is here.
This is where you belong.

109
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,459
Thanks, James.

110
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,459
Don't forget to
stop by the house for a brew.

111
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,779
Well, you see here, Mr Thomas,

112
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,459
what I'm saying is
they call themselves vets,

113
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:38,379
and they're all right with cattle
and that class of thing,

114
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,539
but they're no use with cats
and dogs, you mark my words.

115
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:45,059
What you need is
some of my shampoos.

116
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,979
Oh, that will see him right as rain
in a minute, won't it, Rex?

117
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,219
Won't it, my sweetheart?

118
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,019
You're starting early.

119
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,739
Do I detect a note of judgment
in your tone, Maggie?

120
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,419
Far be it from me.

121
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,619
Oh, wheesht, Rex.

122
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,179
You'll give yourself a sore throat.

123
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,739
Rex!

124
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,619
Come here, Rex!

125
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:10,779
Rex!

126
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,139
He came out of nowhere!

127
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,939
It's all right. I'll take care
of him.

128
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,699
What are you doing?!

129
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,059
Poor thing! Come on, now.

130
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,739
Come on, now.

131
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,299
He needs a vet, Mrs Donovan. Rex...

132
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,939
My boy!

133
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,739
I've no doubt Mrs Donovan's
shampoos are marvellous for cleaning

134
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,579
a dog's fur, but they'll do nothing
to mend a broken hip.

135
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,299
If you'd like to wait, Mr Thomas,

136
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,619
then I'm sure Mr Farnon will be
with you in a minute.Thank you.

137
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,859
Siegfried, hit by a car. Hold on!

138
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,339
Hold on!

139
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,219
What are you going to do to him?

140
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,579
Mrs Donovan, perhaps you should
wait in the living room.

141
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,939
I am not leaving my dog!

142
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,059
What happened exactly?

143
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,699
Oh, he bolted and then a car came.

144
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:08,619
Chloroform. There's no need.

145
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,659
Has he gone?

146
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,139
No, he hasn't! That's my dog!

147
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,899
Massive internal haemorrhaging,
I think.

148
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,139
I can feel damage
to the pelvic bone.

149
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,779
Nothing we could have done.

150
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,499
I'm so sorry, Mrs Donovan.

151
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,339
Hi, James. How are you doing, Jenny?

152
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,259
Hello. Hello.

153
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,099
What is it?

154
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,619
Oh, nothing. There was just
some pollen in the air.

155
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,779
That's it, Candy. Good girl.

156
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:39,819
Jenny, you're not jinking off
school, are you?

157
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,619
I said she could. She don't want
to miss the birth.

158
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,339
It's all Pythagoras and his blooming
triangles anyway.

159
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,259
How's that supposed to help me
milk the cows?

160
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,019
Speaking of which,
you might make yourself useful.

161
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,179
I'll leave you pair to it.

162
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,419
I was always trying
to skip school at her age.Really?

163
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,859
I always had you down as a bit
of a goody-two-shoes.

164
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,779
I'll try not to take
offence at that.

165
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,779
Shall we have a look at you, then,
Candy, to see how your foal's doing?

166
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,659
Many more calls today?

167
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,259
You're my last. I've got to get
a sample from the Dalbys

168
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,939
over to Harrogate.
It could be salmonella.

169
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,779
Oh, that's the last thing
Phyllis needs.

170
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,179
When will you get the results?

171
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,739
Should be a day. It's a fair drive.

172
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,179
If you're able to get away, it'd be
nice to have some company.

173
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,379
There's a few things I need to
finish on the farm first.

174
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,699
I'm happy to wait.

175
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,779
I thought we could have dinner
with my folks tomorrow.

176
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,659
Together? All of us?

177
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:39,179
Well, I'd like to introduce you to
them since you are...

178
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,219
Well, we are...you know.

179
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,299
And I met your dad.
I even wore his shoes.Right.

180
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,059
I must check I've got a clean
frock, then.

181
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,979
Do you think he suffered at all?

182
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,779
I'm certain he didn't.

183
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,339
You can leave him here
if you'd prefer.

184
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,459
Oh, no. My Rex will have
a proper burial.

185
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,059
There's a spot down
by my boat...

186
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,259
.. under a tree.
He used to like it.

187
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,219
Sounds perfect.

188
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,219
Shall I carry him over for you?

189
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,939
Aye, well...

190
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,579
I suppose that's all right, then.

191
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,619
Did you have him long?

192
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,579
Eight years all in. He must have
seen a lot of the world with you.

193
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,739
I'm sure he had a wonderful life.

194
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,059
What would you know about our life?

195
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:57,299
No, no, I'm not saying I do,
I just imagine.

196
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,419
Whenever I saw him out and about
with you, he always looked happy.

197
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,659
You know where you are with a dog.
They're loyal.

198
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,539
They don't judge you for who or what
you are.

199
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,419
What is it you're after?

200
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,619
Cos I'm telling you, if it's
money, you'll get none for me.

201
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,419
I'm not after anything.

202
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,499
Right. Well, why are you
doing this, then?

203
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,499
Sure, you hardly know me.

204
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,899
I saw what happened to your dog
and I wanted to help him.

205
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:27,619
And I suppose, deep down, it also
means I wanted to help you too.

206
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,099
It's not just the animals.

207
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,819
Are you soft in the head?

208
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,139
What are you on about?

209
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,739
It doesn't matter.
Something somebody said to me once.

210
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:41,939
More than once.

211
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,939
You're a funny man.
Did anyone ever tell you that?

212
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,779
More often than I care to mention.

213
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,499
Well, you might take it
as a compliment.

214
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,299
There's room enough in this world

215
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,579
for folks of all
kinds of different stripes.

216
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,179
Who's that fella?

217
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:01,979
You're all right, he's with me.

218
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,619
That's my boat.

219
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,899
And my lamb there.

220
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,219
My Rex is dead.

221
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:12,659
He felt nothing.

222
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,859
You wains can help me
lay him to rest.

223
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,179
How old were your parents
when they got married?

224
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,619
Dad said he were barely out of short
trousers when he asked me mam.

225
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,859
I don't know my parents got engaged.
Never thought to ask.

226
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,579
No. You never struck me
as the romantic type.

227
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,179
I am romantic!

228
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:50,379
Oh, no, I didn't mean it
in a bad way.

229
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:52,259
I just meant you're not one
for grand gestures

230
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,139
or anything too extravagant.

231
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,859
I like that about you.

232
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,019
My mum thinks if I stay in this job,
I'll never find a wife.

233
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,539
And Siegfried thinks
I should just get on and marry you!

234
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,019
Oh! What did you say?

235
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,259
I laughed.

236
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,659
He said I'd a habit of being
too cautious,

237
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,459
that I don't have the courage
of my convictions

238
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,659
and see dangers
where there are none.

239
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,219
That's how Siegfried put it anyway.

240
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,659
You know, there's
something in what Siegfried said.

241
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,059
In what way?

242
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:30,059
Well, you do sometimes overthink,
see catastrophe round every corner.

243
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,699
It's not something I want to do.

244
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,859
Then don't. Don't?

245
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,859
Overthink. Worry less.

246
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:38,139
I wish I could.Well, you can.
I can?

247
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,499
Why not?

248
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,459
Just decide to be
positive and take the plunge?

249
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,899
What's the worst that could happen?

250
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,539
You'd say no!To what?

251
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,099
Asking you to marry me.

252
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,899
Stop the car.

253
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,299
Helen, I'm fine with you
not being ready.

254
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:32,579
I just...

255
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,299
I just need a moment.

256
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,499
But I'm not afraid to say it.

257
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:49,219
Say what?

258
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,379
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

259
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:55,779
Here in the Dales.

260
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,859
I'm not afraid either.

261
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,579
You're not?

262
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,259
No.

263
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:31,499
James, why do you smell like that?

264
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,419
I ran out of bath salts so I used
Mrs Hall's.

265
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,059
I may have overdone it somewhat.

266
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,259
What? Is it the smell? Don't worry,
it'll be gone in a couple of days.

267
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,059
It's not the smell. The ring?

268
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,819
I haven't got a ring! You see, this
is the problem with not planning!

269
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,459
It's Dad. I take it you haven't
spoke to him?

270
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,259
Look Dad in the eye.

271
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,539
And don't gabble. Sometimes
when you're nervous, you gabble.

272
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,139
What do you mean, I gabble?
I don't gabble. When have I ever...

273
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,339
I hardly ever.
Unless I'm really nervous maybe.

274
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,099
Right.

275
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:16,339
Something's wrong.

276
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,739
I would have sent for Mr Farnon.

277
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,979
There's summat up with our
Candy. Come quick, will you?

278
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,539
The uterus is twisted.

279
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,219
And that's bad, is it?

280
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,899
Give me a hand.

281
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,819
Now, when it's open like this, you
can put your hand straight through.

282
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,659
But if I twist it...
Nothing can get through.

283
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:33,219
That's what's
happening inside Candy.

284
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:35,499
And we need to unwind it.
If you can't?

285
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,059
We'll lose them both, love.

286
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:44,019
Jenny, go up to the phone box
and call Skeldale House.

287
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,539
We're going to need some help.

288
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,139
Oh.

289
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,339
Darrowby 2-2-9-7.

290
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,259
Oh, Jenny, hello, how are you?

291
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,099
Mr Farnon?

292
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:16,139
He's just coming, love.

293
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,219
Jenny Alderson.

294
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,979
Jenny?

295
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,619
I'll be out there straight away.

296
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,819
I'll get your jacket.

297
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,619
Is something going on?

298
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,419
Problem with the Aldersons' horse.
James needs my help.

299
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,099
Hold that.

300
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,779
Thank you.

301
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:55,099
This morning,
I had another talk

302
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,099
with the German Chancellor,
Herr Hitler.

303
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,579
Here is the paper...

304
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:01,819
Hello, you.

305
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,099
..which bears his name upon it
as well as mine.

306
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,259
Good book?

307
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:08,459
Mm.

308
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,699
Some of you perhaps have already
heard what it contains...

309
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,699
..but I would just like to read it
to you.

310
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,579
..the British Minister have had
a further meeting today...

311
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,619
Siegfried! Wait!

312
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,499
..and are agreed in recognising

313
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,299
that the question of Anglo-German
relations is of the first importance

314
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,739
for the two countries
and for Europe.

315
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,819
We regard the agreement
signed last night

316
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,059
and at the Anglo-German Naval
Agreement as symbolic of the desire

317
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:46,339
of our two peoples never to
go to war with one another again.

318
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,539
Good evening, Richard, Helen, Jenny.
What's the presentation?

319
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,379
Uterus is still twisted.

320
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,059
It's too late to carry out
a caesarean.

321
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,739
Don't worry, the cavalry's here.

322
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,939
So you're going to try to turn
her over to unwind it?

323
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,139
That's the plan. I'll take hold of
the hooves.

324
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,459
Siegfried, Mr Alderson, when I
say, roll the horse over.

325
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,899
Hopefully it'll untwist
the uterus around the foal.

326
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,779
Tris, give them a hand
if they need it.

327
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,459
Jenny, love... I'm staying. Ready?

328
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:15,859
Come on, then.

329
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,899
It's all right. Candy was their
mother's horse.

330
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,739
It'll put everything right.

331
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,499
I've got hold of the feet.

332
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,659
All right. Now, roll her.

333
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,659
Stop, stop, hold on.

334
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,339
I'm losing grip
of the foal's hooves.

335
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,019
All right.

336
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,059
I've got them. Ready?

337
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,699
Go.

338
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,899
Is it working?

339
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,659
Yeah, I can feel it loosening.

340
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,899
It's coming towards me.

341
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,779
The foal's coming.

342
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,179
It's coming. It's coming!

343
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,219
It's coming.

344
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,859
He's done it! It's out!

345
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,779
Oh. Evening.

346
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,739
Thought we'd drop by and see
if you fancied a stroll?

347
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,859
Let me grab my coat. Come here.

348
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,739
Go one.Aw!

349
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,899
Go on.Go on. Aw!

350
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,499
One more, one more.
Come on, little one.

351
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,899
Go on, little one.

352
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,339
Yay! There we are.

353
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,819
Our work here is done.

354
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,339
I'll call her Joan. After mum.

355
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,179
Aye, that'll do.

356
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,019
We'll, um, leave 'em be.

357
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,139
Mother knows what's best for 'em.

358
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:04,019
Jenny...

359
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,739
Jenny. But...

360
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:13,459
Must be going bloomin' soft.

361
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,099
She's, er...

362
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,539
She's a good girl, is Candy.

363
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,419
Mr Alderson...

364
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,259
..I'd like to marry your daughter.

365
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,499
Right.

366
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,979
You better come up to t'house, lad.

367
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,459
It's been good weather for t'hay.
Aye, it is. That's true.

368
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:02,699
Drop of rain won't do any ill, mind.
Oh, definitely.

369
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:05,779
Definitely, just to...moisten it.

370
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:14,419
No, I'm fine.

371
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,219
Actually... Thank you.

372
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:30,699
I had a wife in a thousand.

373
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,539
I've heard a lot about her.
She certainly sounds it.

374
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,739
Nobody thought she'd settle for
a fella like me. You know?

375
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,139
But she did.

376
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:47,179
One in a thousand, she were.

377
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:51,539
Bit bloody stubborn, though,

378
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,979
she set her mind to it.

379
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,579
I... All right, why not?

380
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,819
You know, I can't...

381
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,219
I can't picture her face
the way that I used to.

382
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,099
Time passes.

383
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,059
But I see it in them girls of mine,
I see it in our Jenny.

384
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,819
She has that look when
she gets cross, and

385
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,779
our Helen has her smile.

386
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:31,179
I see it sometimes when I catch her
looking at you.

387
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,299
Aye.

388
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:39,019
Mr Alderson, I love Helen.

389
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,619
I'll take care of her.I doubt that.

390
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,339
She'll be t'one taking care of you,
lad. With your permission.

391
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,619
What for?

392
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,979
You've already asked her,
haven't you?

393
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,539
I did. I have.

394
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,699
How did you know?I told you.

395
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:01,659
That smile, her mother's smile.

396
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,059
Listen.

397
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,219
There's no point asking me
for my permission, lad.

398
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,699
That lass does exactly
as she chooses.

399
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,259
Like her mother. Stubborn.

400
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,099
That were Helen's mother's.

401
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,099
My Joan.

402
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,419
Might you use it?

403
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,299
I'd be honoured.

404
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:54,939
Thank you.Aye.

405
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,219
Good lad.

406
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:28,859
Leftover stool samples. Unlike
James not to have cleaned them out.

407
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:31,659
Lovely. Where is he, by the way?
Shouldn't he be up by now?

408
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,779
Didn't get back from the Aldersons
until late last night.

409
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,179
I know you want the salve,
Mr Cranford.

410
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:40,179
But we are not a delivery service.

411
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,059
If you'd like to come by...

412
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,059
Get that bloody salve
sent over!

413
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:49,659
Rude man! Cranford?

414
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,499
Need you ask?

415
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,099
I'll drop the salve round
for him later.

416
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,739
Oh, there you are James. What time
do you call this? Sorry, Siegfried.

417
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,739
Late night. I got waylaid at the
Aldersons.Ha-ha, really?

418
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,339
Talking to Richard.
Oh, Richard now, is it?

419
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,699
Asking his permission
to marry Helen!

420
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,139
Oh, my goodness! Congratulations!

421
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,059
Let me give you a kiss.

422
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,299
Well, hang on,
she hasn't said yes yet.

423
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,499
She has! James, well done!

424
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,539
I got the order of things
a little muddled up.

425
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,459
I've got you to thank for that,
Siegfried.

426
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:24,779
Yes, well, you took your time
about it. Mr Farnon. What?

427
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:27,579
Oh, all right. Well done.
Yes, very good, very moving.

428
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:28,899
Drinks later to celebrate?

429
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:32,739
Let's see how dinner with my parents
goes first.Are you bringing Helen?

430
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:35,179
Oh, they're going to be so pleased.

431
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,419
Another busy day?

432
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:45,179
A list far too long and varied to
encapsulate in a few brief words.

433
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,499
He said he had to come to it
himself. Oh, rubbish.

434
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,419
What happened to doing as you're
damn well told?

435
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:53,899
Go on. You better be off to meet
your parents.

436
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,779
Hold on. I had a phone call
from a lab in Harrogate.

437
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,979
They said they didn't find anything.

438
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,659
Why are you smiling?
Is that a good thing? Aye. It is.

439
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,179
There you are.

440
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,779
Come on, then.

441
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,419
What's this?

442
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:32,739
Come on.

443
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:36,219
Good boy.

444
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,459
Good boy!

445
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,739
Come on, then, you.

446
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,499
Come on. That's it.

447
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,339
Good boy!

448
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,179
There's my boy!

449
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,819
Give your ma a kiss.

450
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:25,379
Let me take that for you, Dad.
Thank you, son.

451
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,019
We'll drop your things at the inn,
and then we'll go for a drive.

452
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,539
Where to? You'll see.

453
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:33,459
On a beautiful day like this,
you can see for 20 miles.

454
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,099
But when the weather comes in,
it's a brutal place.

455
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:38,699
Snow ten foot deep, fog so thick
you can barely see your hand

456
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,299
in front of your face.
I don't like the thought of you

457
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,019
going out in weather like that.
Thank goodness you won't have to do

458
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:46,339
this much longer. It's not so bad.

459
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,859
Slipping off in the dead of night?

460
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,219
Not coming home until morning?

461
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:56,219
You'll never find a wife carrying on
like that, you know. It's unnatural.

462
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,459
And those grandkiddies don't make
themselves, you know.

463
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,019
Good to see you, Dad.

464
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,779
Pick the leaves like these, and
don't be pulling up the meadowsweet,

465
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,499
cos it needs leaf to bloom.

466
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,819
Right. Look miserable.

467
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,099
Hello, Mrs Donovan.

468
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,099
What's up with this one, then?

469
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:23,459
He's a stray.

470
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,539
Where are you taking him?

471
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,379
Well, with no home to go to,
there's really only one option.

472
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:35,779
We'll have to put him down.
Got no-one to take care of him.

473
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,539
No-one's going to want a dog
in this state. Give him to me.

474
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,379
I'll have him.

475
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,859
Really, he should be
checked over by a qualified vet.

476
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:46,939
Oh, I'll take care of him,
never you worry.

477
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:53,259
He might benefit from those
shampoos of yours.

478
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,779
Maybe he's not as daft as he looks.

479
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:05,139
Come on, down you get.

480
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:06,979
That's it.

481
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,499
Why on earth have
you brought us here?

482
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:12,699
I've got a few jobs to get through
this afternoon.

483
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:14,859
I'm sorry. It won't take long.

484
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:19,139
All right there, Jim?
Afternoon, Phyllis.

485
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:22,939
These are my parents,
Hannah and James.Hello.

486
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,579
Afternoon. Hello.

487
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,779
What we saying then, Jim?
Don't keep us waiting.

488
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:28,699
Thankfully, it's not salmonella.

489
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:31,899
In fact, the laboratory couldn't
find anything wrong with them.Oh.

490
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,819
There must be a mistake,
because I can see how bad they are,

491
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:37,779
and they're getting worse
by the day.

492
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,419
There's something
I want to show you.

493
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:44,059
Come on.
Why don't we take a look?

494
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,139
Come on! Oh...

495
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,899
Oh!

496
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,259
See this light colouration
around the eyes?

497
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:00,739
It's like they've got spectacles.

498
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,059
Aye, that's right, Billy.
Well spotted.

499
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,819
I noticed it last time I was here,
but I wanted to rule out

500
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:08,019
everything else to confirm
the diagnosis.

501
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,659
So, what is it?

502
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,099
They're suffering
from copper deficiency.

503
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,139
You can tell by the loss
of pigment in the coat -

504
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,059
particularly around the eyes.

505
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,259
I take it by the smug look
on your face you know how to fix it.

506
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,459
Certainly, I do.
A simple solution given orally.

507
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:26,579
It'll have to be repeated, to make
sure they don't get deficient again.

508
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,059
Other than that,
they'll have a long and happy life.

509
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,299
And it is very expensive?

510
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,499
Cheap as chips.

511
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,139
Yes!

512
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,459
We mix it,
and you administer it yourself.

513
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,659
I'll have some ready for you to
pick up tomorrow.

514
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,539
Good God, Jim, don't do that to me.

515
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,339
I thought for a minute there
we were beaten.

516
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:44,979
I don't think you'd ever be that,
Phyllis.

517
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,419
Well, better get back. Mm-hm.

518
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,779
Get tea ready for the brood. Yeah.
Thanks, James.

519
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:50,139
Cheerio. Nice to meet you.

520
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,579
See? Told you everything would be
all right. Yes, we made it.

521
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,539
It's beautiful up here, isn't it?

522
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,299
Aye, it is.

523
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,899
I'll drop you at the end
to freshen up.

524
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,099
Where are you gallivanting
off to now?

525
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,139
I'm bringing someone to dinner
I'd like you to meet.

526
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,539
I want to say...

527
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,459
..that the settlement of the
Czechoslovakian problem...

528
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,539
..which has now been achieved...

529
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:29,739
..is in my view only the prelude...

530
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,259
..to a larger settlement...

531
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,939
in which all Europe may find peace.

532
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,539
Careful, you'll get messed up.

533
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,059
James' parents have us down as a
right bunch of scruff-backs.

534
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,539
Yeah, well, they need taking in.

535
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,739
Otherwise they'll be roosting
all over the place.

536
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:54,299
Give him here. Give him here!

537
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:55,539
Ready to go?

538
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,139
Erm, I'm just going to see if Deb
needs help with anything first.

539
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,419
Don't worry.

540
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,379
They're going to love you.Hm...

541
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:03,979
Is that...? Looks like something
on the back of your dress.

542
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,619
You said I couldn't do
romantic gestures.

543
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,979
Get up, you daft beggar.

544
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:29,499
Is that...?

545
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:33,219
Is that me mum's?

546
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,259
It is.

547
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:59,539
James will be back soon.

548
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,419
Drink, anyone? Whisky perhaps?

549
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,499
God, yes!

550
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,699
We won't actually.
We're not big drinkers.

551
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:05,739
No, neither are we.

552
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:06,979
Special occasions.

553
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,139
It's a fine place you have here,
Mr Farnon.

554
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,459
James can't speak highly
enough about it.

555
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:18,619
Ah.

556
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,379
You must be sorry to be losing him.

557
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:22,419
What?

558
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,859
What are you talking about?

559
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:29,059
Oh, no, me and my big mouth.

560
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,579
Did you not know?

561
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,059
Hello!

562
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,659
Sorry that took a while.
No trouble at all, son.

563
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,459
Mr Farnon's been keeping us
entertained.

564
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:41,539
We were just talking about how sorry
he'll be to see you gone.

565
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,659
Yes, something of a shock.

566
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,699
No doubt we'll find a replacement
easily enough.

567
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,779
Siegfried.

568
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,979
Who's this? Aren't you going
to introduce us?

569
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,379
Erm, right.

570
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,419
Mum, Dad, this is Helen...

571
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:57,339
..my fiancee.

572
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:03,019
Hello. How do you do?

573
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,339
It's lovely to meet you both.

574
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:11,579
Tristan, would you like to come and
set the table for dinner?

575
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:12,979
Why don't I give you a hand?

576
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,139
Once you're married,

577
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:22,819
we'll see if we can't squeeze a
bigger bed into James' room.

578
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,979
Oh, should be able to manage that.

579
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,699
It'll be a busy house,

580
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,579
but I'm sure we'll all
rub along just fine.

581
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,499
Mum, I want you to know this hasn't
been easy, but...

582
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:37,899
What?

583
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,099
What hasn't been easy?

584
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,459
I should've told you sooner,

585
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:50,219
but the truth is I didn't fully
know for a long time.

586
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:54,819
I'm staying here,

587
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,819
and it's not only because of Helen.

588
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:57,899
What about the job?

589
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,419
I was tempted, I won't lie.

590
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:03,059
But thinking about it's made me
realise all the more

591
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,339
how much I love it here.

592
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,379
Every day is different.

593
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,699
I wake up and I have no
idea where the job will take me.

594
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:12,899
I could be up in the High Dales
wrestling cattle

595
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:16,739
or helping a dog that's had its
paw caught in a trap.

596
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:19,299
It's this place, those hills...

597
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,819
James is too modest to ever
say this himself,

598
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:30,259
but he's made such a difference to
so, so many people since he arrived.

599
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,819
It's especially true for me
and my family,

600
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:34,619
and so many others.

601
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:37,099
That farm you visited today,
the Dalbys,

602
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,819
that's the second time
he's saved their herd this year.

603
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,379
What he does here really matters.

604
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,699
Oh, but Bill's place...

605
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:46,539
You can work normal hours,
it's so modern and new.

606
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:48,259
That's not what makes a practice.

607
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,059
It's the people.

608
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,059
I love this place.

609
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:00,219
It's my home now.

610
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,259
You should be so proud of him.

611
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,859
I certainly am.

612
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,219
And I love him

613
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:16,419
with all my heart.

614
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:22,539
So long as you're both happy.

615
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:24,299
That's all we've ever wanted
for you.

616
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,859
Aye, it's true.

617
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,899
I wish we could convince you to
stay another night.

618
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,899
No, we need to get back
and see about gaining some work.

619
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,779
I'll be back up to visit you
as soon as I can.

620
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:48,819
Christmas maybe.

621
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:49,899
Visit?

622
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,099
You don't visit your home.

623
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:53,859
It's your real home,

624
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:54,899
and it always will be.

625
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:57,419
I know, Mum. I didn't mean that.

626
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:58,899
You're my boy.

627
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,579
Bye, son.

628
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,779
You've made a nice little
life for yourself down here.

629
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:03,779
Thanks, Dad.

630
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,379
Look after him for us.

631
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:07,419
I will.

632
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:11,979
Bye. Bye, love.

633
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,819
Right, let's get you in that bus.

634
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:45,299
I love you.

635
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:47,939
I love you, too.

636
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,659
Oi! There you are!

637
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:54,539
Hey, I'll have a word with you!

638
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,819
It's about that...

639
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,339
..that damn...

640
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,819
..salve you sent me!

641
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,219
To peace! To Mr Chamberlain!

642
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,179
Mr Chamberlain!Good man.

643
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,139
Isn't it something?

644
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:17,099
You don't realise how much something
weighs on you till it's gone.

645
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,339
I know exactly what you mean.

646
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:21,539
Now, look here, I think
it grossly unfair of you to

647
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:25,099
characterise my support as something
akin to the trials of Atlas.

648
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,059
I only push you because I know you
could achieve

649
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:29,259
so much more than you do,
and if I didn't push you,

650
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,459
then you damn well wouldn't do
anything useful...

651
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:32,539
Here! Here he is!

652
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,299
What do you think
of this one, then?

653
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,459
I cleaned the foots,

654
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,819
and all it took
was some of my shampoos.

655
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:40,859
I named him Roy.

656
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:44,179
And to think you were going to do
away with him.

657
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:45,739
You were right, Mrs Donovan.

658
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,779
Your shampoos really seem to
have done the trick.

659
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,259
Come here, you.

660
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:54,139
You needn't think I don't know what
you were up to.

661
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:57,499
Come on, Roy. Come on, son.

662
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:02,059
How is everything?

663
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,299
Can I get you anything else?

664
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:04,419
Any more drinks?

665
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:08,459
There was a stray
moping about the place.

666
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,339
I wanted to see
if I could do something for him

667
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,019
and help Mrs Donovan
at the same time.

668
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:14,499
That sounds very kind of you.

669
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:18,059
Sorry, Siegfried,
you were saying something about me

670
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,299
never doing anything useful.

671
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:20,339
I take it back.

672
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,859
Now you're going to have
to give me some money.

673
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:26,699
Oh, I just bought you a drink. Don't
tell me you've guzzled it already.

674
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:31,059
So I can go back to college.
I've decided to re-sit parasitology.

675
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:33,739
I think veterinary practice might
be my calling after all.

676
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:39,059
Tristan, is it possible that you
got Cranford's salve

677
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,819
mixed up with a stool sample?

678
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,179
Just bumped into him
outside the Vulcan Inn.

679
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:46,739
Said he started to rub
it in before he realised.

680
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:48,979
No-one gets to be rude to Mrs H.

681
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:50,779
Quite right, well played.

682
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:51,819
Good boy.

683
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:56,299
Siegfried, I know I should've told
you about the job sooner,

684
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,099
but I meant what I said.
I've learnt so much from you.

685
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,939
Yes, well, I couldn't help noticing
that both of you took rather a long

686
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:03,139
time fully to appreciate...

687
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,859
Oh, be quiet.

688
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:07,219
Hear, you pair...

689
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:09,019
..to your engagement

690
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,939
and a very happy future together.

691
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:12,179
Hear.

692
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,699
Thank you.

693
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:14,979
