1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,303
你们有没有用过这个功能 不按键
Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,038
就能和Siri对话?
without pressing any buttons?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,473
没有 怎么用啊?
No. How does it work?

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,910
只需要说"嘿 Siri 现在几点?"
You just say, uh, “Hey, Siri, what time is it?”

5
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,179
现在是傍晚6点37分
The time is 6:37 p.m.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,380
赞吧
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,615
所以现在任何人都能控制你的手机了?
So now anyone can control your phone?

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,852
嘿 Siri 给我看些老奶奶的光屁股图
Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,587
想得美
Nice try.

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,790
- 它只认我的声音  - 好吧
- It only recognizes my voice.  - Oh. Cool.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,860
嘿 Siri 给我看些老奶奶的光屁股图
Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,863
我的声音不是这样的
I don't sound like that.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,733
请看老奶奶的光屁股图
Here are some images of naked grandma butts.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,136
嘿 告诉大家个好消息
Hey. Good news, everybody.

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,405
既然我已经和Amy分手了
Now that I'm no longer with Amy,

16
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,341
就多出了张水族馆餐厅每年一度感恩节
I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet

17
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,010
自助午餐的票 谁想要?
at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it?

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,548
要知道 你不会一个人去的...
Well, you realize you won't be going alone...

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,216
我会一直在那里
I'll be there the whole time.

20
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:56,020
提供鱼类和朝圣鱼的小知识
Providing fish and pilgrim facts.

21
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:00,024
你们能听到我说话吗?
Can you people hear me?

22
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,792
我们要请人来吃饭
Well, we're having everyone over.

23
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,561
没错 我和Leonard一整天都要
Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,963
- 做饭  - 不然我们很想去的
- all day.  - Otherwise we'd love to.

25
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,131
但实在去不了
But we can't.

26
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,066
真是可惜
Yeah, poor us.

27
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,104
我和Raj要去施食处
And Raj and I are volunteering

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,439
当义工 去给流浪汉准备食物
at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.

29
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,608
Howard 那你呢?
Well, Howard, what about you?

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,843
哦...
Oh...

31
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,745
我去不了 我也得去施食处
I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.

32
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:25,482
你之前还说这主意糟透了
You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.

33
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,986
如果你在我撒谎的时候都不挺我
If you can't support me when I'm lying,

34
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,789
那我们干嘛要结婚?
why are we married?

35
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,159
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

36
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,762
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

37
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,397
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

38
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,933
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

39
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,602
* 我们建长城 * * 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall * * We built the pyramids *

40
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,272
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *

41
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,174

- 嗨 Sheldon 什么事?  - 我视频你
- Hi, Sheldon. What's up?  - Well, I'm calling

47
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,434
是因为感恩节快到了
because Thanksgiving is coming up,

48
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:11,005
我想给你水族馆的票子
and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.

49
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,439
没人能陪你去吗?
No one can go with you?

50
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,842
没有 他们宁愿彼此共度佳节
No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other

51
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:18,479
也不愿意陪我庆祝我今年终于摸了海星
than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish.

52
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,180
反正我是不想
Anyway, I wouldn't want

53
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:24,151
浪费这些票子 所以你随便请个人一起去吧
the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you'd like.

54
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:25,719
噢
Oh.

55
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:28,622
- 好吧 谢谢  - 到时敬请
- Okay. Thank you.  - And feel free

56
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:31,258
告诉你请的客人 缅甸鲶鱼
to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,627
也被人称为"朝圣鱼"
is also known as the pilgrim fish.

58
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,498
以免那里的火鸡太干 你需要点"有料"的东西来调剂
In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy.

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,068
Sheldon... 我能看出你很想去
Sheldon... I can tell you want to go,

60
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,570
如果你不觉得尴尬的话
so if you'd be comfortable with it,

61
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:46,039
也许我们能以朋友的身份一起去
maybe we could go as friends.

62
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,308
你觉得那样不会尴尬吗?
You don't think that will be awkward?

63
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,144
好吧... 毕竟是去水族馆餐厅过感恩节
Well... it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria,

64
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:54,181
所以我想冒险承认 的确有够尴尬的
so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes.

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,684
但如果你是指我俩之间的事...
But if you mean between us...

66
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,586
我觉得应该没问题
I think it'll be fine.

67
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,239
那好吧
Very well, then.

68
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,275
我们感恩节早上见
I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.

69
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,077
- 到时见  - 噢
- See you then.  - Oh,

70
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,546
忘掉我刚才说的缅甸鲶鱼小知识
and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish.

71
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:11,949
我在水族类小知识这块储备很少
My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.

72
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,152
你知道第一个感恩节的时候
Did you know they served shellfish and eel

73
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,459
他们吃了贝类和鳗鱼吗?
at the very first Thanksgiving?

74
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,889
我的储备用完了
And there goes my list.

75
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,560
安排是怎么样的?
So, how does this work?

76
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:25,029
施食处的经理会分派工作
The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs,

77
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,998
一次工作六个小时
and the shifts are six hours.

78
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,132
六个小时?
Six hours?

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,636
天啊 我可不想抱怨那么久
Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.

80
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,006
你以前有为别人做过什么事情吗?
Do you ever do anything for anyone else?

81
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:40,611
我恰巧是个乐于付出的慷慨情人
I happen to be a giving and generous lover.

82
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,848
我们的关系够近吗 我能说这话很诡异吗?
Are you and I close enough for me to say that's creepy?

83
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,952
够近了 我觉得你其实想说的是... 我吐!
We are, and I believe the word you're looking for is... yech!

84
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,588
有什么事吗?
Uh, can I help you?

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,423
嗨 我们想来做义工
Hi. We'd like to volunteer.

86
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,192
很感谢你们过来
Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down,

87
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,593
但我们这里已经够人了
but we already have enough people.

88
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,361
改天欢迎你们再来
Any other day, please, come back.

89
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,363
噢 好吧
Oh. Okay.

90
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,304
别沾沾自喜地笑了
Wipe that smug smile off your face.

91
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,240
也许我只是高兴 有那么多人来这里
Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up

92
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,509
帮助那些不幸的人
to help the less fortunate.

93
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,846
我们的关系够近吗 我能说...
Are you and I close enough for me to say...

94
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,781
他是个混蛋? 他早就是了
That he's an ass? He beat you to it.

95
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,084
我弄错了 有一大群人没法来了
I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.

96
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,320
太棒了 我们很乐意帮忙的
Oh, great. We'd love to help.

97
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,357
别沾沾自喜地笑了
Wipe that smug smile off your face.

98
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:30,728
停不下来!
I can't!

99
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,064
看看我们!
Look at us!

100
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,166
婚后的第一次感恩节
Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.

101
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,334
我懂
I know.

102
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,502
突然感觉我长大了
I feel so grown up.

103
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,837
- 亲爱的 你本来就长大了  - 真的?
- Sweetie, you are grown up.  - Really?

104
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,908
你见过几个成年人的手套是斯波克手势的?
How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?

105
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,908
{\an8}斯波克: "星际迷航"人物

106
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,144
嘿 菜谱在我的iPad上
Hey, the recipes are on my iPad.

107
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,912
- 你能打开吗?  - 好
- Will you pull 'em up?  - Yep.

108
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,915
- 密码是什么?  - 我的生日
- What's the code?  - My birthday.

109
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,617
密码不对
It's not working.

110
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,186
就四位数... 月和日
It's just the four digits... month and day.

111
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,089
不对
Nope.

112
00:04:58,157 --> 00:05:00,358
我来看看
Let me see.

113
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,362
不是对的嘛
Yeah, there.

114
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,636
你刚才输了什么数字?
What number were you putting in?

115
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,772
呃...
Uh...

116
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,076
你不知道我的生日 是吧?
You don't know my birthday, do you?

117
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:20,845
- 我知道  - 几月几号?
- Yes, I do.  - Well, what is it?

118
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,981
五月
May.

119
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,416
五月几号?
May what?

120
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:28,019
我不能把你的密码大声说出来
I'm not gonna say your password out loud.

121
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,388
这样不安全
That is not secure.

122
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,158
你竟然不知道自己老公的生日
You don't know your own husband's birthday.

123
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,725
好吧...
Well...

124
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,226
你对我也不是无所不知的呀
you don't know everything about me.

125
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,361
你的生日是12月2号
Your birthday is December 2,

126
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:37,962
你在Perkins街长大
you grew up on Perkins Street,

127
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,931
你的社保最后四位数字
the last four digits of your social are

128
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,266
是7621
7-6-2-1,

129
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,136
你想赖掉这件事的几率是零
and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.

130
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:47,472
看看我们
Oh, look at us.

131
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,508
离婚前的最后一个感恩节
Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.

132
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:54,779
你好
Hello.

133
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,147
嗨
Hi.

134
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,915
准备好去水族馆了吗?
Ready for the aquarium?

135
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,419
准备好了 为了缓解尴尬
I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness

136
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:05,089
让我们知道如何以朋友身份相处 我打印了一张
as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list

137
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,693
礼貌对话的安全话题单
of safe topics for polite conversation.

138
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:11,562
这能让你更舒坦点就好
If that makes you more comfortable.

139
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,699
如果写一张能让我更舒坦的事情的列表
If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable,

140
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,168
写列表这件事肯定在那张表里
lists would be on the top of that list.

141
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,971
那开始吧... 噢
Okay, now... Oh.

142
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,508
"我们上次交谈过后 你养了什么宠物吗?"
"Since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"

143
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,043
没有 你呢?
No. You?

144
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,145
没有
No.

145
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,316
"我们上次交谈过后 你有计划
Um, "Since last we spoke, have you planned

146
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,384
或是去度过假吗?"
or gone on any vacations?"

147
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,787
我下周也许会去拜访我的阿姨
I might go visit my aunt next week.

148
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,388
在莫德斯托的那个?
Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?

149
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:39,157
不 在贝克斯菲尔德的那个
No, the one in Bakersfield.

150
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,359
贝克斯菲尔德 好吧
Bakersfield. I see.

151
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:44,228
我以前怎么没有这列表?
Where has this list been all my life?

152
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,733
我们需要你们帮忙洗盘子
We're gonna have you washing dishes.

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,969
围裙和手套在这边...就是...
Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here... just...

154
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,070
刷一刷 冲干净 再叠起来
scrape, wash and stack.

155
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,639
有事的话 我随时都在
If you need me, I'll be around.

156
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,509
所以我们都不能上前面发食物吗?
So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?

157
00:06:58,577 --> 00:06:59,977
有什么区别呢?
What difference does it make?

158
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,246
不知道 我还指望会有可怜的小孩
I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid

159
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:03,714
跑上前跟我说
would come up to me and say,

160
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,851
拜托您 先生 我还想要一点
Please, sir, I want some more.

161
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,088
你是在施食处
You're in a soup kitchen,

162
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,791
不是雾都孤儿的片场!
not a production of Oliver!

163
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:17,361
我又没有指望他们会唱歌
It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.

164
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:22,400
明天是73度
and then the next day was 73 degrees,

165
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,402
后天是72度
and the day after that was 72,

166
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,203
之后还是72度...
and then it was 72 again...

167
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,805
然后是74度
uh, then it was 74,

168
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:29,907
然后是今天...
and that brings us to today, at...

169
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:33,644
如果我有短裤我会穿的... 78度
I'd wear shorts if I had a pair... 78.

170
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:36,380
天气讨论完了吗?
Are we done discussing the weather?

171
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:38,382
这算是在"讨论"吗
I don't know if I'd call it "discussing."

172
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,252
你就坐在那儿 活都是我一个人干的
You kind of sat back and let me do all the work.

173
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,154
让我瞧瞧
Let's see

174
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,422
单子上下一条是什么
what's next on the list.

175
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,223
哦 是这个 呃 "你削木头吗
Oh, here. Uh, "Do you whittle,

176
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,159
削的话 你通常用什么
and if so, what kind of knife

177
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,727
- 样的..."  - Sheldon
- do you..."  - Sheldon.

178
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,430
我们已经认识很久了
We've known each other a long time.

179
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:55,099
我们完全有能力
We are perfectly capable of having a conversation

180
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,302
不依赖任何下载下来的清单对话
without relying on a list off the Internet.

181
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,271
好吧
All right.

182
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:01,972
那我们该聊些什么?
Well, what should we talk about?

183
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,276
不知道 想到什么问什么吧
I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.

184
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,845
好的
Very well.

185
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:10,848
我知道你已经在约会其他人了
I know you've been seeing other men.

186
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,985
你跟他们上床了吗
Have you had coitus with any of them?

187
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,922
天啊 我真是自找的啊
Man, I walked right into that one.

188
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,361
接下来要加一勺胡椒粉
Next we need a teaspoon of pepper,

189
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:29,100
我想 胡椒粉也是你小时候养的那条狗的名字
which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.

190
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:33,304
好吧 你以为你懂很多是不是
Fine. You think you know so much.

191
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,439
辣妹里我最喜欢哪一个?

192
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:37,007
- Baby  - 超级男孩里我最喜欢哪一个?

- Justin.  - Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?

194
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,212
- 骗谁呢 超级男孩脑残粉  - 要命!
- Nice try. NSYNC forever.  - Damn it!

195
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,114
面对现实吧
Face it,

196
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,483
你难不倒我的... 我是老公中的战斗机
you can't stump me... I am the king of husbands.

197
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,251
我知道你不喜欢我在
I know that you don't like the lingerie

198
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,686
情人节给你买的那套贴身内衣
that I got you on Valentine's Day.

199
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:51,722
- 我知道你不喜欢"潮湿"这个词 我知道...  - 等等
- I know you hate the word "moist." I know...  - Hang on.

200
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,225
等等 我为什么我不喜欢你买给我的内衣?
Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?

201
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,287
因为是橘色的
Because it's orange

202
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,190
你觉得这让你看上去像个放荡的胡萝卜
and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.

203
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,332
有意思
Interesting.

204
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600
我从来没跟你说过
I never told you that.

205
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,668
- 你肯定说过  - 没有
- Sure you did.  - No.

206
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,804
我谁都没说过
I never told anyone that.

207
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,807
但是我写在日记里了
But I did write it in my journal.

208
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,143
什么?
What?

209
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:18,148
我都不知道你写日记
I didn't know you had a journal.

210
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:22,686
我还知道你说谎的时候音调会变高
I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.

211
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:25,322
哪有啊
No, it doesn't.

212
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,864
这让我想起了高中生活
You know, this reminds me of high school.

213
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:38,432
你在餐厅工作吗?
You worked in a restaurant?

214
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,970
不 我在印度呢... 那里天气潮湿而且咖喱味十足
No, I was in India... it was humid and smelled funny.

215
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:45,673
好吧 我想我已经进入最佳状态了
All right, I think I'm getting into a groove here.

216
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,107
也没那么糟嘛
This isn't so bad.

217
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,343
还有5小时40分钟我们就能撤了
Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.

218
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,979
我们才干了20分钟?!
We've only been doing this 20 minutes?!

219
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:54,515
我之前读到过
You know, I read that

220
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:57,217
洗盘子是一种很好的冥想方式
washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation.

221
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,386
秘诀在于洗盘子时
The key is that while washing the dishes

222
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:03,824
我们只能... 洗盘子
one should only be... washing the dishes.

223
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,427
你有口音
Just because you have that accent

224
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:09,396
并不意味着你说出来的东西就不蠢
doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.

225
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,198
不 我是认真的
No, seriously.

226
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,400
说的是活在当下
It's about being present in the moment,

227
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,537
感受水的温热感
focusing on the feeling of the warm water,

228
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,405
洗涤剂的清香
the smell of the detergent,

229
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:22,142
盘子摩擦的声响 跟随自己的气息
the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath.

230
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,612
感受... 仅仅存在着的感觉
It's about... it's about simply being.

231
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:29,883
好的 我试一下
Okay.. I'll try  t.

232
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,824
我需要三个人来前台
I need three people out front.

233
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:39,493
- 我来!  - 我!  - 马上过去!
- I'll do it!  - Me!  - Right here!

234
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:43,030
不公平啊! 我刚刚在冥想!
No fair! I was meditating!

235
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
别生气嘛
Come on, don't be mad.

236
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,507
都多久以前的事了 而且是场意外
It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.

237
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,171
你怎么能意外读了我的日记?
How can reading my journal be an accident?

238
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,305
我不知道那是什么
I didn't even know what it was.

239
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,508
我看见在你床头柜上 就拿起来看一眼
I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.

240
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,443
你知道那是本日记的时候 为什么没有停下来?
Well, when you realized what it was, why didn't you stop?

241
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,845
你知道我这个人嘛 我是个书虫
You know me, I'm a big ol' bookworm.

242
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,222
好吧 我们先把饭煮完吧
All right. Let's just finish cooking.

243
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,185
好吧... 行 我来补偿你嘛
Well... Hey. O-Okay. Let me make this up to you.

244
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,887
我有时写网络日志
Sometimes I keep an online journal.

245
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,622
你来念我写的东西
I want you to read something that I wrote.

246
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,524
- 真的吗 我没事的  - 好吧
- Okay, really, I'm fine.  - Okay.

247
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,159
那就我读给你听
Well, then I'll read it to you.

248
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,661
是我们初遇的那天
It's from the day we first met.

249
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,800
- "真是美女啊 她叫Penny"  - 天啊
- "Beauty, thy name is Penny."  - Oh, God. 

250
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,568
别念了
Stop.

251
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:22,803
我不要你念
I don't want you

252
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,271
这些拍马屁的话
to read something you think'll just butter me up.

253
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,606
我要你念最近写的东西
I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.

254
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,442
好吧
Fine.

255
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,776
嗯...
Mmm...

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,515
"Penny是个大美女 就像我们的爱
"Penny's beauty, like our love,

257
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,852
与日俱增"
grows more with each passing day."

258
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,986
你真这么写的?
Does it really say that?

259
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:44,124
我说谎干嘛?
Why would I lie?

260
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:47,360
"老天 老天
"OMG. OMG.

261
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,296
新的星战马上要来了
We're so close to the new Star Wars.

262
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,465
简直受不了了
I can't take it.

263
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,500
噶"
Gah."

264
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,568
"噶"?
"Gah"?

265
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:57,270
你没读对
Well, you didn't read it right.

266
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:00,807
新的星战快来了 啊!
The new Star Wars is coming. Gah!

267
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,015
我感觉气氛有点尴尬
I'm sensing things have gotten awkward.

268
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,418
不 挺好的
No. It's okay.

269
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,754
要是朋友的话 就可以无话不谈
If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.

270
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,656

00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:20,760
所以 你对我约会其他人有疑问
So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.

Just a few.

273
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,431
说吧
Go ahead.

274
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,433

都是些什么人? 你们去了哪?

276
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,904
你在哪遇见他们的? 你跟他们上床了吗?
Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them?

277
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,772
离水族馆还有多久?
And how much longer to the aquarium?

278
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,175
我有点饿了
I'm getting kind of hungry.

279
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:37,577

282
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,787
一个在书店遇见的 还有两个是网友

在杂物箱里给你准备了
And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you

286
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:54,494
一包麦圈
in the glove compartment.

287
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:57,831
原味的还是蜜果味的?
Uh, regular or honey nut?

288
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,167
我把它们混在一起了
I mixed them.

289
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,435
混在一起了 怪不得男人们
You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers

我相信你
I believe you.

298
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,633
如果你放点麦片我会更相信你的
I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.

299
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,240
- 给你端过来了  - 多谢
- Here you go.  - Thanks.

300
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,075
一定是在逗我吧
You got to be kidding me.

301
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:43,710
你说什么
Sorry?

302
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,580
你... 你是Elon Musk
Y... You're Elon Musk.

303
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,647
是的
I am.

304
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,255
你在这儿做什么?
Wh... What are you doing here?

305
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,490
洗盘子啊
I'm washing dishes.

306
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:58,692
嗯...
Well,

307
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,393
我本来负责分发火鸡
I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted

308
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,829
但因为给了太多肉汁被下放到这里来了
for being too generous with the gravy.

309
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,033
我的天
Oh, man. I...

310
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,568
遇见你真是太荣幸了
What an honor to meet you.

311
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:13,306
我是特斯拉和SpaceX的忠实粉丝
I'm-I'm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX.

312
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:13,306
{\an8}(SpaceX是Elon Musk创立的美国太空运输公司)

313
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,008
都是你的公司
All your companies.

314
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:16,943
我是加州理工的Howard Wolowitz
Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.

315
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,412
很高兴认识你 Howard 来这里帮助不幸的人
Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here

316
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,114
感觉不错吧?
and help the less fortunate, huh?

317
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,083
这还用你说?
Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:28,288
没什么比帮助别人更爽了
Nothing better than helping people.

319
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:32,626
这也是我在
Which is something I realized

320
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,461
国际空间站
when I was viewing Earth

321
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,697
遥望地球的时候意识到的
from the deck of the International Space Station,

322
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:41,434
我以卫星装备专家的身份在那儿工作了两个月
where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job

323
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:47,140
毕竟哥是麻省理工培养的工程师啊
I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

324
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,176
我还以为我添油加"汁"了呢
And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.

325
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,412
对不起 只是...
Sorry. It's just...

326
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,780
你可是你啊
you're you, you know?

327
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:57,951
你能收养我就好了
And I really want you to adopt me.

328
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,386
你在感恩节的时候来这里
Well, you're here on Thanksgiving,

329
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,487
所以你大概也是个不错的人
so you're probably a good person.

330
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:04,190
我把我的妻子也带来了
Oh. I made my wife come down, too.

331
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:07,427
你觉得自己还会回到太空吗?
You think you might ever get back out to space?

332
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,331
这是份工作邀请吗? 因为我真的很想去火星啊
Is that a job offer? 'Cause I really want to go to Mars.

333
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,365
如果我能带上我老婆的话
Assuming I can bring my wife.

334
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,933
她不会占用太多空间的
She hardly takes up any room.

335
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,836
她基本可以随身携带
She's basically a carry-on.

336
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:18,471
我们还没做到那个地步
Well, we're not quite there yet,

337
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,240
但我们确实在找工程师
but we're always looking for engineers.

338
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,075
给你我的电子邮箱 我们保持联系
So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.

339
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:23,677
谢谢
Thank you.

340
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,213
看
Oh, look.

341
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,815
有人基本没动这份南瓜派呢
Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.

342
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,218
要和我分着吃吗?
Want to share it with me?

343
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:36,222
一个收容所剩下的
A-a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie

344
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,957
半份南瓜派?
from a homeless shelter?

345
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,093
还是和Elon Musk分 必须的啊
With Elon Musk, you bet I do!

346
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,734
对于一个在水族馆餐厅的
You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet

347
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:51,738
感恩节自助餐来说 这可太差了
in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.

348
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:54,474
你只是不爽他们发完了朝圣帽而已
You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.

349
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,877
他们给了那个小婴儿一个 他连眼睛都没睁开
They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.

350
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:02,716
如果你没有对一个小婴儿不爽 这还不算假期呢
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.

351
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,250
噢
Oh.

352
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,954
想不想玩一个我发明的海洋主题游戏?
Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?

353
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,089
好啊 怎么玩?
Sure. What is it?

354
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,358
这个游戏叫食物 朋友和对抗
It's called Food, Friend, Fight.

355
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,727
一个人选择三种水生生物
One of us chooses three aquatic creatures,

356
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,262
另一个人分别决定哪一个是食物
and the other one must decide which he would eat,

357
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,998
朋友或者敌人
befriend, or battle.

358
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,634
这就像亲吻 结婚和处决
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

359
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:22,769
那是什么?
What is that?

360
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,671
这个游戏给出三个人
It's a game where you're given three people

361
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,440
需要决定亲吻 结婚或者杀死的对象
and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

362
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,143
我的游戏好多了 比起结婚
Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone,

363
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,879
你可以把他们吃掉
you get to eat them.

364
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,147
来玩吧
Let's just play.

365
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:35,749
我先给你来个简单的
I'll start you off easy.

366
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:40,487
电鳗 河豚 虾
Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.

367
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:43,156
额...
Hmm. Well,

368
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,691
我不会和一条电鳗打架
I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know

369
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,193
我知道它放出的电可是能杀死一匹马的
it can generate enough current to kill a horse.

370
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,828
所以我会吃掉鳗鱼
So I'd eat the eel,

371
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:52,031
和虾打一架 然后和河豚做朋友
fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish,

372
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,433
毕竟在姐自大的日子里
because it would be nice to have company

373
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,568
有个陪伴也是极好的
on those days I feel bloated.

374
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,568
{\an8}河豚会胀大身体

375
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,071
不错啊
Very well done.

376
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,072
谢谢
Thank you.

377
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,774
到你了
Okay, your turn.

378
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:03,042
海豹
Hmm. Seal,

379
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,178
八目鳗类鱼...
hagfish...

380
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:08,348
海绵宝宝
SpongeBob SquarePants.

381
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,184
我想和海绵宝宝做朋友 但他不是真的
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real,

382
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,585
所以我不能那么做 是吧?
so I can't do that, can I?

383
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,221
但你能和八目鳗类鱼做朋友吗?
But you can pal around with a hagfish?

384
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,224
嘿 别逼我
Hey, let's not pull at that thread.

385
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,126
好吧 我和海绵宝宝打架
Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob,

386
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:23,930
因为他很友好 我们到最后最多只会互相挠痒痒而已
because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other.

387
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,732
我和海豹做朋友
Um, I'll befriend the seal,

388
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,534
因为他能被训练 我现在的朋友
because he's trainable, which is the problem

389
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,202
可没这个优点
I'm having with my current friends.

390
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,206
这就意味着我要吃掉八目鳗类鱼了
Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.

391
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,875
不恶心吗? 一条八目鳗类鱼
Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce

392
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,445
瞬间就能制造一桶黏液哦
enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.

393
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:42,148
我知道 就当它自带肉汁吧 顺着食道就滑下去了
I know. It makes its own gravy... it'll slide right down.

394
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:50,757
我很怀念这个
I miss this.

395
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,461
你怎么能怀念一个自己从没玩过的游戏呢 傻吗?
How can you miss a game you've never played before, silly?

396
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,731
我想有时我是挺傻的
I guess sometimes I'm silly.

397
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:05,237
嘿 你去哪儿了? 我不知道这个火鸡烤熟了没有!
Hey. Where'd you go? I can't tell if the turkey's done!

398
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,305
来了!
Be right there!

399
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,313
嗨 宝贝儿
Hi, lover.

400
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:21,553
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

401
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,555
对不起看了你的日记 我想补偿你
I'm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you.

402
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:29,027
我允许你在Facebook上发一张我的艳照
So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.

403
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,627
{\an8}我偷看了老婆的日记 我是根调皮胡萝卜

404
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,031
我才不要把这个放到网上
I am not putting that on the Internet!

405
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,533
我不希望别人看到这个
I don't want people to see this.

406
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,235
连我都不想看到!
I don't want to see it!

407
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:39,704
不想别人看到啥?
Don't want people to see what, huh?

408
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,974
来点这个?
A little bit of this? Oh...

409
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,277
啊?
Huh?

410
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,947
再来点这个?
Some of this?

411
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,584
既然这是感恩节
And, since it's Thanksgiving,

412
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:56,388
再来点这个怎么样啊?
an extra helping of this?

413
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:58,356
感恩节快... 我去
Happy Thanks... Yikes.

414
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,532
我很高兴你和Amy相处的不错
I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.

415
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,668
我也是 发现我和她
Me, too. It's comforting to know

416
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,270
能做朋友真是太舒心了
that she and I are able to function as friends.

417
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,606
我从没和前任当过朋友
Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.

418
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,509
我相信你和Leonard可以的
Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.

419
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:27,648
噢 是我的朋友Amy
Oh. It's my friend Amy.

420
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,216
你好
Hello.

421
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,351
嗨 Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

422
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,852
我现在从我妈妈家里开车回家
I'm just driving home from my mother's.

423
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,788
过得愉快吗?
Did you have a nice time?

424
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:36,190
是的
I did. Um...

425
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,928
今天早上和你一起我非常开心
listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.

426
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,930
这也不全是我的功劳
Well, I can't take all the credit.

427
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,932
那只凤尾鱼方向游反了
It was pretty funny when that one anchovy

428
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,935
挺搞笑的
started going the wrong way.

429
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,404
是啊
It was.

430
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,940
听着
Uh, listen,

431
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,710
我在想
I... I was thinking that, um,

432
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,181
或许我准备好重新当你女朋友了
maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.

433
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,683
噢
Oh.

434
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,519
我以为我们只是朋友
I thought we were just friends.

435
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:06,654
我们是
We are.

436
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,323
但我希望
But I was hoping,

437
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,292
- 或许...  - Amy
- maybe...  - Amy,

438
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,094
我擅长很多事情
I excel at many things,

439
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,030
但是放下你绝对不是我的强项
but getting over you wasn't one of them.

440
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,935
我想只做你的朋友就好了
I think I need to just be your friend.

441
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,271
好吧
Okay.

442
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,273
我理解
I understand.

443
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,810
嗯
Good.

444
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,112
我看了一个关于
Oh, I watched a video

445
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,114
八目鳗类鱼制造黏液的视频
of the hagfish producing mucus,

446
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:36,751
我决定改变主意 吃掉海绵宝宝
so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.

447
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,020
好的
Okay. Sure.
