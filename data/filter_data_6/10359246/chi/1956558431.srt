《致命女人》前情提要
Previously on Why Women Kill..

19
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,710
他们给我洗胃了
They pumped my stomach.

20
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,080
我不会出那个医药费的
I'm not paying for that.

21
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,930
明明打个嗝都能吐出药片救活你
Not when a good burp would've saved you.

22
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,380
卡尔的轻率之举我已经耳闻一段时间了
I've known for some time about Karl's indiscretions.

23
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,680
有天我去取干洗的衣服
I was picking up my dry cleaning,

24
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,020
他的车停在那里
and there was his car,

25
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,130
就在街对面的什么三流旅馆前面
parked across the street at some seedy motel.

26
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,000
你还想跟我滚床单吗
You still want to make love to me?

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,970
-是的  -我今天四点没事
- Yeah. - I'm free today at 4:00.

28
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,050
我们应该去哪里
Where should we go?

29
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,020
你是个男人了  自己想
You're a man now; figure it out.

30
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,170
我不会进入你的移动性窝的
There's no way I'm getting into your mobile sex den.

31
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,630
你看上去容光焕发
You seem, uh... energized.

32
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,470
是吗
Do I?

33
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,000
你最近是开始了新的锻炼课程吗
Have you embarked on a new exercise regimen?

34
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,820
我打算有空就去健身
I plan on working out as often as I can.

35
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,690
那天她一直不停地说
The other day, she was going on and on

36
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,080
她有多喜欢我的电影
about how much she liked my movie.

37
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,980
我们已经是开放式婚姻了
You know what? We've already got an open marriage...

38
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,380
我会去问她愿不愿意三人行
I'll ask her for a three-way.

39
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,290
如果她拒绝的话...
If she says no...

40
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,270
她同意了
She says yes.

41
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,270
天呐
Oh, my God.

42
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,890
你爱上她了吗
You in love with her?

43
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,350
你最近没有安全感
You've been insecure lately

44
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,740
-因为你事业不顺  -你爱上她了吗
- because of your career. - Are you in love with her?

45
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,590
没有
No.

46
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,170
你的有妇之夫有跟你说过
Has your married man ever told you

47
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,920
他为什么需要出轨吗
why he feels the need to cheat?

48
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,650
他厌倦了自己的老婆
He was bored with his wife.

49
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,460
这是本手册  给夫妻用的
It's a manual. For married couples.

50
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,680
这都是小黄图
These are dirty pictures.

51
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
都是很科学的
They're scientific.

52
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,720
我需要专注
I have to concentrate.

53
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,240
罗伯  拜托别走
Rob, please don't go.

54
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,420
今晚真令人尴尬
This has been an awkward night.

55
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,110
我必须到场
I need to make an appearance.

56
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,290
他们一定是重要客户
They must be important clients.

57
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,480
别等我
Don't wait up.

58
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,000
{\an8}致命女人
第一季  第三集

59
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,700
开始很缓慢
It begins quite slowly.

60
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,360
一个表情
With a look.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,690
或者一个动作
Or a gesture.

62
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,930
一旦接受了邀请
And once the invitation is accepted...

63
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
探戈就开始
The tango begins.

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,820
这是预见的舞
It is a dance of anticipation.

65
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,380
-诱惑的舞  -欲望的舞
- Seduction. - Desire.

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,940
也是爱情的舞
And love.

67
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,740
有人说两个人才能跳探戈
You know, some say it takes two to tango.

68
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,620
但有时  潜伏在黑暗中的
But sometimes, lurking in the dark...

69
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,690
是第三人
Is a third.

70
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,060
如果你要和他跳舞
Now, if you choose to dance with him,

71
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,880
做好应对后果的准备
be prepared to deal with the consequences.

72
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,960
因为激情可以变成嫉妒
For passion can turn to jealousy.

73
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,620
爱可以变得暴力
Love can become violent.

74
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,900
是的  探戈的存在是为了提醒我们
Yes. The tango exists to remind us

75
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,680
最伟大的爱情故事
the greatest love stories...

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,730
都以死亡收场
End in death.

77
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,440
跟你说下
Just a reminder,

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,410
我明天前要完成那个项目
I've got that project due tomorrow.

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,910
所以你又要加班吗
So you'll be working late again?

80
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,870
恐怕是的
Afraid so.

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,550
抱歉  亲爱的
Sorry, honey.

82
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,220
你今天有什么计划
What are your big plans for the day?

83
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,840
没什么有意思的
Oh, nothing interesting.

84
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,830
要去干洗店
Need to drop by the dry cleaners.

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,650
然后去集市买点东西
After that, I'll go to the market for some shopping.

86
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,010
然后也许会和一个新朋友吃午饭
And then I might have lunch with a new friend.

87
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,430
这是你的电话号码
This is your phone number.

88
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,730
既然我们成了密友了
Oh, I thought you should have it,

89
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,580
我想你应该知道
now that we're getting to be chums.

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,050
这样  如果你哪天
This way, if you ever need someone

91
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,300
需要约人去看电影
to go with you to the movies...

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,440
我可以打给你  明白
I can call you up. Got it.

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,720
我在一对恩爱夫妻那租了一间房
Now, I rent a room from a lovely couple.

94
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,500
妻子的名字也叫希拉
The wife's name is also Sheila.

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,310
如果你打电话  她接了的话
So, if you call and she answers...

96
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,520
那我就说找另一个希拉
Then I'll ask for the other Sheila.

97
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,550
没错  这周很忙吗
Exactly. Busy this week?

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,200
我安排挺松的  除了今晚
Uh, my schedule is pretty open, except for tonight.

99
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,990
我有约会
I have a date.

100
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,690
和你的有妇之夫
With your married man?

101
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,940
他完成了一个大项目  为了庆祝
He finished some big project at work. To celebrate,

102
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,940
他在一个高级夜店给我们定了位子
he got us reservations at this really fancy night club.

103
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,680
他要带你出去
He's taking you out?

104
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,330
当众
In public?

105
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,280
第一次  就像是真的男友一样
For the first time. It's like an actual boyfriend.

106
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,140
是不是很棒
Isn't that nice?

107
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,860
你在笑什么
What are you smiling about?

108
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,770
这事的荒谬
Oh, the absurdity of it all.

109
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,940
我要在餐车上
I'm having the best sex of my life

110
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,920
享受美妙性生活了
in the back of a catering van.

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,710
也许等格罗夫先生搬出去后
Well, maybe when Mr. Grove moves out,

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
我们可以去你的床上做
we could start doing this in your bed.

113
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,320
好
Yes...

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,140
说到这个
So, about that...

115
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,000
卡尔或许会在我家比预想中住得久一点
Karl may be staying in my home longer than we discussed.

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,730
多久  一周吗
How much longer? A week?

117
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,100
不止
Longer.

118
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,950
两周
Two weeks?

119
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,800
他要在我女儿婚礼之后才会走
He won't be leaving until after my daughter's wedding.

120
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,720
那还要两个月啊
That's two months away.

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,320
我不介意在车上做
Well, I don't mind the van.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,820
不  那不是重点
No, that's-that's not the point.

123
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,620
萨蒙妮  他背着你和男人偷情
Simone, he cheated on you with men.

124
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,760
你为什么不马上赶他走
Why would you let him stay for five more seconds?

125
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,560
我也想赶他走
Well, I tried to throw him out.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,270
-他不走吗  -他说如果我赶他走
- And he wouldn't go? - He said that if I made him leave,

127
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,900
他就要告诉我所有朋友他是同性恋
he would tell all my friends he was gay

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,170
在婚礼前让我丢脸
and embarrass me before the wedding.

129
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,960
所以他是在威胁你
So he's threatening you?

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,590
不  只是小小的勒索
No, it's just a little light blackmail.

131
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,270
好吧  我来搞定这件事
All right. I'll take care of this.

132
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,170
什么意思
What does that mean?

133
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,730
没什么  我要让他明白他在犯错
Nothing. I'm just gonna convince him that he's making a mistake.

134
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,150
真可爱
That's adorable.

135
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,480
我是认真的
Hey, I'm serious.

136
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,420
请让我帮你
Please, let me help.

137
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,290
当然不行
Absolutely not.

138
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,220
我不会伤他太重
I'm not gonna break any bones.

139
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,430
我只会让他吃点苦头
I'm just gonna bend some stuff.

140
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,090
汤米  你觉得如果你去揍我丈夫
Tommy, how do you expect our secret affair to remain secret

141
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,680
被警察抓了
once you've been arrested by the police

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,980
我们的私情还怎么藏得住
for beating up my husband?

143
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,080
我只是随便说说
I was just spitballing.

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
我很感谢你的热情
Well, I appreciate the passion,

145
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,170
但还是把它留在车里吧
but save it for the van.

146
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,930
我还是想找个晚上在一条小黑巷里单独会会卡尔
I'd still love to meet Karl alone in a dark alley some night.

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,620
当心
Careful.

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,550
他可能会很喜欢那样呢
He might enjoy that.

149
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,540
好的  不  我明白
Yes. Um, no, I understand,

150
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,200
只是我已经看了两遍证词
it's just that I've been through the deposition twice

151
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,990
没有找到任何有用的东西
and I couldn't find anything useful.

152
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,340
伊莱
Eli.

153
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,750
伊莱
Eli.

154
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,910
好
Yes.

155
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,440
我会再看一遍的
I will check again.

156
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,400
没问题
Sure.

157
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,810
那是什么
What's that?

158
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,440
今早买的  很不错吧
Got it this morning. It's pretty sweet, right?

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,460
你不是已经有把吉他了吗
Uh, don't you already have a guitar?

160
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,120
是  不  亲爱的  这是把贝斯
Yeah, no, honey, this is a bass.

161
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,640
有五根弦  听起来完全不一样  你听
Five strings, it sounds totally different. Check it out.

162
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,120
-很酷  -是啊
- Very cool. - Yeah.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,980
-你去厨房吗  -嗯
- Oh, are you going to the kitchen? - Yeah.

164
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,360
能帮我拿杯汽水吗
Could you grab me a soda?

165
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,130
好
Sure.

166
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,050
里面冻成碎冰的
With the, the crushy ice?

167
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,070
爱你
Love you.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,650
你听说那个大消息了吗
Did you hear the big news?

169
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,210
伊莱买了把贝斯
Eli bought a bass.

170
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,890
听见了
Oh, I heard.

171
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,470
他觉得这能帮他突破写作瓶颈
He thinks it's gonna help him work through his writer's block.

172
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,190
很好  他也是因为这个理由买了那把吉他
Great. That's how he ended up with his other guitar,

173
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,320
那台游戏机和椭圆机
the Xbox and the elliptical.

174
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,400
明白了
Got it.

175
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,070
你今天过得怎么样
So, how was your day?

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,340
忙死了  我连午饭都没机会吃
It was crazy busy. I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch.

177
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,050
天呐  你一定要尝尝这个
Oh, God, you have to try this.

178
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,520
给
Here.

179
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,160
很烫  小心
It's hot. Careful.

180
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,750
-太好吃了  -很好吃吧
- That's amazing. - It's good, right?

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,200
是的  所以伊莱今天有写了什么吗
Yeah. So, did Eli get any work done today?

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,180
我不知道  我出去办事了
I'm not sure. I was running errands.

183
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,380
-你怎么不问他  -不了
- Why don't you ask him? - No.

184
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,260
如果我问伊莱  "你写了什么吗"
If I ask Eli, "Did you get any writing done?"

185
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,120
在他听来我只是在不停地叨叨
what he hears is, "Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag."

186
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,440
我什么都不会说  表示支持就好了
I'm just gonna say nothing and be supportive.

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
这就是我支持的微笑  你觉得怎么样
This is my supportive smile. Tell me what you think.

188
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,350
很可怕
It's terrifying.

189
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,430
我有个主意
Hey, I have an idea.

190
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,250
晚饭后  我们去跳舞吧
After dinner, let's go dancing.

191
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,770
-今晚吗  -嗯  银湖新开了一家夜店
- Tonight? - Yeah. There's this new club in Silver Lake

192
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,690
我超想去看看
I've been dying to check out.

193
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,510
我还有很多文件要看
I have a lot of reading to do for work.

194
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,190
拜托
Oh, come on.

195
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,650
你太紧绷了  我都记不起
You've been so stressed, and I can't remember

196
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,890
上次我们一起去跳舞是什么时候了
the last time we went dancing together.

197
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,630
可以来点私人时间  就我和你
I could use some alone time, just you and me.

198
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,300
真的吗
Really?

199
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,250
我们可以去泡夜店了
So we can go clubbing?

200
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,120
-泡夜店  -伊莱
- Clubbing? - Eli.

201
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,180
你不是在弹贝斯吗
Thought you were playing your bass.

202
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,770
我以为你会帮我拿瓶汽水
Thought you were grabbing me a soda.

203
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,950
我正准备拿
I was getting to it.

204
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,620
所以你们要去夜店
So you guys are going clubbing, huh?

205
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,720
是的
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

206
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,540
好吧  我也去
All right. I'm in.

207
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,270
伊莱  你又不跳舞
Eli, you don't dance.

208
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,520
我跳舞的  以我自己的方式
I dance. In my way.

209
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,700
你跳起舞来  大家都要被你干扰了
When you dance, you're in everyone's way.

210
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,480
怎么  你们真的不想我去吗
What? You guys really don't want me to come?

211
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,930
不  不  不
No. No, no, no.

212
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,750
我们很乐意你来  对吗
We'd love for you to come. Right?

213
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,420
当然
Absolutely.

214
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,540
笑得真诡异
Creepy smile.

215
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,230
卡尔
Karl?

216
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,640
她回来了
There she is.

217
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,430
娜奥米
Naomi.

218
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,230
我们有约吗
Did we have plans?

219
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,700
不是  我只是想问你个问题
No, I just popped in with a question.

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,240
卡尔说你去了邮局
Karl said you went to the post office,

221
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
所以我就等你回来
and so I waited.

222
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,910
等了一个小时
For an hour.

223
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,470
是的  我们得谈谈慈善晚会的娱乐活动
Yes. We need to talk about the entertainment for the benefit.

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,540
慈善晚会
Benefit.

225
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,620
为烧伤患者举办的
For the burn victims.

226
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,800
天呐
Oh, my God.

227
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,130
我完全忘记这事了
I forgot all about it.

228
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,780
萨蒙妮  你可是负责装饰的
Simone, you're in charge of the decorations.

229
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,930
没关系  我几周前已经买好东西了
It's fine. I ordered everything weeks ago.

230
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,760
因为最近的事情我有点分心
My mind's been elsewhere because of recent events.

231
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,600
你的保留节目还来吗
Are you still up for your number?

232
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,890
萨蒙妮答应过你们会重现
Simone promised the two of you would reprise your dance.

233
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,070
你们在乡村俱乐部才艺秀上的舞蹈
From the country club's talent show.

234
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,440
是吗
Oh, did she?

235
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,460
考虑到最近的事  我不确定还想不想跳
I'm not sure I'm up for it now, given recent events.

236
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,040
如果你们不表演的话
Well, if you don't do something,

237
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,390
艾达·福特扬言要唱歌剧
Ida Ford is threatening to sing opera.

238
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,670
亲爱的  难道火灾受害者受的罪还不够多吗
Oh, darling. Haven't the burn victims suffered enough?

239
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,760
好吧
All right.

240
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,510
我们会表演的
We'll perform.

241
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,960
那就好
I'm so glad.

242
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,690
记着
And remember:

243
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,750
不管你何时想倾诉何事
if you ever need to talk about anything,

244
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,960
我一直都在
I am always here.

245
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,290
是  你确实一直都在我家
Yes. You certainly seem to be.

246
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,060
你为什么让她进来
Why did you let her inside?

247
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,020
我才是该生气的那个
I'm the one who should be miffed.

248
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,410
你为什么不告诉我娜奥米在汽车旅馆看到了我的车
Why didn't you tell me Naomi saw my car at a motel?

249
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,900
万幸她只看到了你的车
We're lucky that's all she saw.

250
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,740
如果她知道你隐瞒身份和陌生男人约炮
If she knew you were having anonymous sex with strange men...

251
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,540
我从未隐瞒过身份
It was never anonymous.

252
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,110
而且当中只有几个是陌生人
And only a few of them were strange.

253
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,390
我才不要听你这破笑话
I am not the audience for that joke.

254
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,430
-你在干什么  -离慈善晚会只有两天了
- What are you doing? - Benefit's in two days.

255
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,360
我们需要排练
We need to rehearse.

256
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,590
我当时在想什么
Ugh, what was I thinking?

257
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,770
我没法和你跳舞  我还生着气呢
I can't dance with you, I'm still furious.

258
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,380
当我们成为全场焦点
You'll forget all about that

259
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,750
被掌声淹没
when we're the center of attention,

260
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,050
你会把这一切都忘得一干二净
drowning in applause.

261
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,980
不要再试图用你的魅力赢回我的心
Stop trying to charm your way back into my heart.

262
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,700
没用的
It won't work.

263
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,110
你瞧  我觉得是你忘记
Now, you see, I think you've forgotten

264
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,750
我们在一起时有多开心
how much fun we have together.

265
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,070
我誓要让你记起
And I am determined to remind you.

266
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,300
你为什么要这么努力地挽留我
Why are you trying so hard to hold onto me?

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,190
因为我爱你  我的宝贝
Because I love you, my darling.

268
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,790
恐怕那还不够
Well, I'm not sure that's enough.

269
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,700
那你听听这一句
Well, try this one beside.

270
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
我其实还挺喜欢你
I actually like you.

271
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,900
你有几任丈夫能说这话
How many of your husbands can say that?

272
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,510
谢了
Oh, hey. Ooh, thanks.

273
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,010
糟了
Oh, crap.

274
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,270
什么  怎么回事
What? What's wrong?

275
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,080
我好像看到我的经纪人了
I think I just saw my agent.

276
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,250
拉马尔在这儿  你怎么不去打个招呼
Lamar's here? Why don't you go say hi?

277
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,780
算了  他只会不停地催我
No, he's just gonna give me a hard time

278
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,240
交剧本
about finishing the script.

279
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,230
有个简单的办法可以摆脱他
There's an easy way to get him off your back.

280
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,730
-什么办法  -写完你的剧本
- What's that? - Finish your script.

281
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,270
就是因为这种态度
This kind of attitude is

282
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,380
我才会把你当做我前妻介绍给大家
why I introduce you to people as my first wife.

283
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,520
你真逗
Yeah, that's funny.

284
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,640
一切还好吗
Is everything okay?

285
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,180
还好  我现在只想和你跳舞
Yeah. I just really want to dance with you right now.

286
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,640
-好啊  那就跳吧  -好的
- Yeah, let's do it. - Okay.

287
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,910
-来吧  -洁德
- Come on. - Jade!

288
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,370
我的天
Oh, my God!

289
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,420
薇沙  我的天呐
Wischa! Oh, my God!

290
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,790
她刚才是说"薇沙"吗
Did she say "Wischa"?

291
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,100
-是的吧  -二位
- I think so. - You guys.

292
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,790
这是我的朋友  薇珞和米沙
These are my friends, Willow and Mischa.

293
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,730
薇沙  我懂了
Wischa. Ah, I get it.

294
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,360
这是泰勒和伊莱
This is, uh, Taylor and Eli.

295
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,850
你们是怎么认识洁德的
How do you two know Jade?

296
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,000
我们去年遇到她
We met her last year.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,980
完全是一见钟情
Oh, and it was love at first sight.

298
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,360
我的天  你们嘴好甜
Oh, my God, you guys!

299
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,540
姐妹  你看起来太他妈赞了
Girl, you look fucking amazing.

300
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,470
她什么时候不他妈赞啊
Mmm, when fucking doesn't she?

301
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,650
从他妈没有过
Fucking never.

302
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,430
我感觉我们不是洁德的第一次三人行
I'm getting the feeling that we weren't Jade's first threesome.

303
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,640
我不明白  你为什么想要
I don't get it. Why would you want to

304
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,830
和这个淫妇做朋友
start palling around with this tramp?

305
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,310
因为我想阻止她继续见我的丈夫
Because I want to stop her from seeing my husband.

306
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,400
在里亚托给她买爆米花算什么
And how is buying her popcorn at the Rialto

307
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,360
阻止她的手段
gonna make that happen?

308
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,140
我在努力建立信任
I'm trying to establish trust.

309
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,770
如果一个陌生人走过来  说你的裙子很丑
If a stranger came up and said your dress was ugly,

310
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,860
你会怎么说
what would you say?

311
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,610
我会说滚开
I'd say fuck off.

312
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,750
但是如果一位好友温柔地暗示
But if a dear friend gently suggested

313
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,780
橘色不太适合你呢
orange is not your best color?

314
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,010
我会把裙子扔掉
I'd get rid of the dress.

315
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,980
如果我要说服艾普尔
If I'm to convince April

316
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,880
和一个已婚男人约会对她没好处
it's not in her best interest to date a married man,

317
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,210
首先我必须成为她的闺蜜
first I must become her confidant.

318
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,350
她的情感顾问
Her close advisor.

319
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,190
懂了
Okay.

320
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,230
那这段新友谊何时开启
So when does this new friendship begin to blossom?

321
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,470
今晚
Tonight.

322
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,750
我以为罗伯今晚要带她去俱乐部
I thought Rob was taking her to the club tonight.

323
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,870
你当真以为我会坐视不管吗
Do you honestly think I'm going to let that happen?

324
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,920
你还好吗
You all right?

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,580
-不  我很紧张  -为什么
- No, I'm nervous. - Why?

326
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,940
我们认识的所有人今晚都会在这里
Everyone we know will be in this room tonight.

327
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,470
你已惊艳过他们无数次
You've dazzled them all a hundred times.

328
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,490
因为我知道他们有多嫉妒我
Because I knew how much they envied me.

329
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,420
如果他们知道真相  定会当面嘲笑我
They'd laugh in my face if they knew the truth about us.

330
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,580
我有个建议  不要告诉他们
Here's a thought. Don't tell them.

331
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,610
大家终究会琢磨出来的
People will be able to figure it out.

332
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,050
你真的以为我们是这里唯一一对
Do you honestly believe we're the only couple here

333
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,800
不加伪装的夫妇吗
pretending to be something that we're not?

334
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,560
-对  -相信我
- No. - Trust me,

335
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,460
今晚这里的每一个女子
there is not a woman here tonight

336
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,510
如果有你一半漂亮的话  都会愿意
who wouldn't trade all of her problems for yours

337
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,100
用她自己所有的难题
if she looked half as beautiful

338
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,570
来跟你交换位置
as you do right now.

339
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,570
但是如果一切都是谎言的话
But what good is other people's envy

340
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,350
别人的嫉妒又有什么用呢
if it's all based on a lie?

341
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,120
我不确定
I'm not sure.

342
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,890
我们去一探究竟吧
Let's find out.

343
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,830
萨蒙妮  你简直美呆了
Simone! You look stunning.

344
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,340
你看上去像个少女
And you look like a teenager.

345
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,000
你的皮肤怎会如此柔软
How do you get your skin so soft?

346
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,800
是一种化学换肤术
It's called a chemical peel.

347
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,170
我知道  再弄一次她就变成歌剧魅影了
I know. One more and she'll be the Phantom of the Opera.

348
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,580
-萨蒙妮  -亲爱的  你好  巴克利

桑迪  你从戒瘾所出来了
Sandy, you're out of rehab.

350
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,950
别担心  我会回去的
Don't worry, I'll be back.

351
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,260
-或许我该去找咱们的桌子  -没必要
- Maybe I should go and find our table. - No need.

352
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,820
我已经安排我们坐在这里了
I've arranged for us all to sit here.

353
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,790
一起吗  有意思
Together? What fun.

354
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,820
我想现在去吧台一下比较好
I think this is a good time to find the bar.

355
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,310
酒马上来  萨蒙妮
Liquor's on it's way, Simone,

356
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,350
由整个派对上最可爱的侍应生端给你

364
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,470
那么米沙  你们是做什么的
So, Mischa, what do you guys do for a living?

365

网红
Influencers?

对  账号名叫处处有内衣

泰姬陵的管理人员也不介意吗

你不能一时兴起就出国
You can't just leave the country on a whim.

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,760

但我晚上要做金枪鱼煲

422
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,840
你想要加面包碎还是不加
Do you prefer bread crumbs or not?

423
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,910
亲爱的  我说过我今晚工作要到很晚

你丈夫没跟我说你会过来

438
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,870

我一想到你拿自动贩卖机里
I couldn't bear the thought of you

450
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,550
买的垃圾食品当晚餐  心里就受不了
getting your dinner from a vending machine.

451

克莱尔
Claire?

457
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,130
她肯定是有事离开了
Ah, she must have wandered off.

458
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,720
我相信她很快就会回来
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

459
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,860
罗伯特
Now, Robert,

460
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,880
我费心费力地做了这个砂锅菜
I went to all the trouble of making this casserole.

461
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,780
我可不希望这里面的金枪鱼坏掉

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,040
很烫  你最好等它凉了再喝
It's very hot. You might want to give it a moment to cool off.

467
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,330
我可没时间等  我还有好多事要做
Oh, I don't have time to wait. I have things to do.

468
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,730
只需要一会儿就好
Oh, it'll just take a sec.

469
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,710
你真是难得的人才  告诉罗伯我回家等他了
You're a treasure. Tell Rob I'll see him back home.

470
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,920
谁说你可以去喝咖啡了
Who said you could have a coffee break?

471
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,820
我真是受宠若惊
I was so flattered.

472
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,500
通常汤米他们公司替我的活动承办宴席的时候
Usually when Tommy's company caters one of my events,

473
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
他都拒绝侍奉我
he refuses to wait on me.

474
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,480
但今晚  他主动要求侍奉这桌
But tonight, he asked for this table.

475
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,840
是吗
Did he?

476
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,220
今晚的主题是「国境以南」
The theme of this evening is "South of the Border."

477
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,160
没错
Yes.

478
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,350
那么是谁为这些服务生选择了弗拉明戈舞的服装
So, who chose the flamenco outfits for the waiters?

479
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,560
我选的  怎么了
I did. Why?

480
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,210
弗拉明戈舞是西班牙的
Flamenco is Spanish.

481
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,810
南边那些国家不是说西班牙语的吗
Isn't that what they speak down there?

482
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,180
西班牙的  意思是在西班牙
Spanish, as in Spain.

483
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,580
是  但那也算国境以南
Yes, but it still counts as south of the border.

484
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,280
是啊  除非你指的是法国国境
Yes, if the border is with France.

485
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,170
你瞧我每天得忍受多么较真的一个人了吧
Oh, do you see what I have to live with?

486
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,500
自以为无所不知
Such a know-it-all.

487
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,190
是啊  我真是鄙视我渊博的知识
Yes, I'm forever flouting my knowledge

488
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,100
竟然知道西班牙在欧洲
that Spain is in Europe.

489
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,270
娜奥米  我想说
Naomi, can I just say

490
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,250
你儿子出落得如此英俊帅气  简直令我惊叹
I'm stunned at how handsome your son's become.

491
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,460
他穿着这种裤子还能呼吸  我也很震惊
I'm stunned he can breathe in those pants.

492
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,030
卡尔
Karl...

493
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,220
你让汤米有些不适了
you're making Tommy uncomfortable.

494
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,060
我吗  把他打扮成像丽莎·明尼利的
Me? I'm not the one who dressed him up

495
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,190
伴舞人员的人可不是我
as a backup dancer to Liza Minnelli.

496
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,010
再来一杯威士忌吧  年轻人
Another scotch, please, young man.

497
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,860
好的  格罗夫先生
Yes, Mr. Grove.

498
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,960
很好  谢谢
Very good. Thank you.

499
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,030
快点回来  汤米
Hurry back, Tommy.

500
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,120
你敢相信她竟然这样跟我儿子调情吗
Can you believe how she's flirting with my son?

501
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,090
桑迪只是闹着玩而已
Oh, Sandy is just being playful.

502
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,020
他才18岁  而她已经32岁了
He's 18. She's 32.

503
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,010
你不觉得那很可悲吗
Don't you think that's pathetic?

504
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,100
失陪下
Excuse me.

505
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,810
伏特加加冰  谢谢
Vodka rocks, please.

506
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,760
你得换一桌侍奉
You have to switch tables.

507
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,490
我做不到
I can't.

508
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,460
那就别老是盯着卡尔了
Then at least stop glaring at Karl.

509
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,710
他是个大混蛋
He's such a jerk.

510
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,070
他只是想显得风趣而已
He's just trying to be funny.

511
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,640
他在侮辱你的尊严
He's insulting your dignity.

512
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,580
你穿着这种衣服  没资格说这种话
You can't say that in those sleeves.

513
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,650
伏特加加冰
Ah, vodka rocks.

514
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,810
谢谢
Thank you.

515
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,540
你找到你的人生使命了
You've found your calling.

516
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,150
你在这儿啊
There you are.

517
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,650
-我在这儿  -你怎么没去跳舞
- Here I are. - Why aren't you dancing?

518
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,270
我好累
I'm tired.

519
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,840
-你准备好走了吗  -现在吗
- Are you about ready to go? - Now?

520
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,380
-是啊  -我跟薇沙玩得正开心呢
- Yeah. - I'm having so much fun with Wischa.

521
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,390
已经过了午夜了
Well, it's after midnight,

522
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,890
我明天还得早起  去工作
and I got to be up early and go to my job

523
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,160
需要我  穿正装  所以...
that requires me to, you know, wear clothes, so...

524
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,160
你喝了多少酒啊
How many of those have you had?

525
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,210
几杯
A couple.

526
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,110
可能不止吧
Maybe two couples.

527
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,660
你似乎很生气
You seem angry.

528
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,740
我没有生气
I'm not angry.

529
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,860
除非你打算跟这些低配版的名媛一起去威尼斯
Unless you're going to Venice with those low-rent Kardashians.

530
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,940
泰勒  说话客气点
Taylor, be nice.

531
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,260
他们是我的朋友
Those are my friends.

532
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,230
是啊  我只是一个将你从施暴的感情关系中
Yeah, and I'm just the person who saved you

533
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,670
解救出来  还让你住在我家的陌路人
from an abusive relationship and let you live in my house,

534
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,280
我他妈算哪颗葱  对吧
but fuck me, right?

535
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,050
好了  我觉得或许你该回家了
Okay. Um, I think maybe you should go home,

536
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,890
我会...
and I will...

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,720
-我们回头再见  -好吧
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

538
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,670
-好吗  -好啊
- Okay? - Yeah.

539
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,470
你要去威尼斯吗
Are you going to Venice?

540
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,830
我还不知道呢
I don't know yet.

541
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,130
好吧  去吧
Fine. Go!

542
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,050
祝你玩得开心
Have the best time.

543
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,540
-走吧  -什么  现在吗
- Come on. - What? Now?

544
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,880
-对  就现在  -好吧
- Yeah, now. - Okay.

545
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,520
斯坦顿家
Stanton residence.

546
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,580
宝贝  谢天谢地你在
Honey, thank God you're there.

547
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,760
罗伯
Rob.

548
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,270
你听起来很不安
You sound upset.

549
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,870
听着  之前你在我办公室的时候
Listen, when you were in my office earlier,

550
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,180
你有没有动过什么文件
did you happen to move any papers?

551
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

552
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,590
德尔福项目的最终草案
The final draft of the Delphi Project.

553
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,110
之前就在我桌上现在不见了
It was here on my desk and now it's gone.

554
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,900
你找了桌子下面吗
Did you look under your desk?

555
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,370
找了  我哪里都找了
Yes, I've looked everywhere.

556
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,440
这非常重要
Now, this is incredibly important.

557
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,310
你确定你没动过吗
Are you sure you didn't touch it?

558
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,190
我很清楚不该碰你的东西
I know better than to touch your things.

559
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,560
该死
Damn it.

560
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,640
如果我找不到它我就要加班重做了
If I don't find this thing, I'll have to stay late and redo it,

561
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,200
全部他妈重做一遍
the whole goddamn thing.

562
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,670
你不是无论如何都会加班吗
I thought you were working late anyway.

563
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,660
那不是一回事
Uh... that was on something else.

564
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,290
那不重要  我得挂了  我得挂了
It doesn't matter. I have to go. I-I have to go.

565
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,190
{\an8}德尔福项目

566
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,950
-你好  -你好  我找希拉
- Yeah? - Hi, I'd like to speak to Sheila.

567
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,510
我就是  你是谁
You're talking to her. Who's this?

568
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,210
我是说你的室友  另一个希拉
I think I mean your roommate, the other Sheila.

569
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,720
我是餐厅的艾普尔
Um, this is April from the diner.

570
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,230
天啊  好吧  等等
Oh, uh, Jesus, all right, hold on.

571
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,910
你知道是谁
You-know-who

572
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,170
她打电话来了  找你的
is on the phone. She wants to talk to you.

573
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,080
就知道她会打来的
Hm. I thought she might.

574
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,370
艾普尔
April?

575
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,300
嗨  我知道通知得有点晚
Hi. I know this is late notice,

576
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,670
但是今晚你愿意和我去夜店吗
but would you like to come with me to the club tonight?

577
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,800
罗伯放了我鸽子
Rob cancelled on me.

578
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,740
我现在一团糟  但是
I'm a mess right now, but

579
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,380
我猜我可以简单打扮一下
I guess I could throw myself together.

580
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,140
那太好了
Oh, good.

581
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,740
是伯班克的白钻石俱乐部
It's the White Diamond Bar in Burbank.

582
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,760
一个小时后我在那见你
I'll meet you there in an hour.

583
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,840
到时见
I'll be there.

584
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,550
-怎么了  -放尊重点  孩子们
- What's going on? - Show some respect, kids.

585
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,520
你们可是站在伟人面前
You're in the presence of greatness.

586
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,830
小心点大伙儿
Careful, everybody.

587
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,110
这些盘子很烫
These bowls are hot.

588
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,430
墨西哥酸辣汤
Tortilla soup.

589
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,790
你不能说这不是"国境以南"的菜肴了
You can't say this isn't "South of the Border."

590
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,250
鉴于萨蒙妮的地理水平
Given Simone's grasp of geography,

591
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,480
我很惊讶我们没喝蛤蜊汤
I'm surprised we're not having clam chowder.

592
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,440
顺便提一下
By the way,

593
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,630
你们听说拉里和苏的最新消息了吗
have you all heard the latest news about Larry and Sue?

594
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,560
他们怎么了
What about them?

595
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,780
他们分居了
They've separated.

596
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,070
-不会吧  -用这么惊讶吗
- No! - Are you really that surprised?

597
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,550
他们老是吵架
They fought constantly.

598
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,540
在我那个年代  人们通常会选择继续在一起
In my day, people stayed married

599
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,840
然后找到解决问题的办法
and found a way to work things out.

600
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,690
这方法不总是可行的
Well, that's not always possible.

601
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,970
萨蒙妮是对的
Simone's right.

602
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,190
人们可以深深关切对方
People can care deeply for one another,

603
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,690
但并不总是意味着他们需要一直做夫妻
it doesn't always mean that they should stay married.

604
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,990
你看  所以承诺才至关重要
You see, this is where I think commitment becomes essential.

605
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,560
人都会犯错
Everyone makes mistakes,

606
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,810
但是如果有爱在
but if love is there,

607
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,530
那就还有救赎之路可以走
then there's a path to redemption.

608
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,820
站着说话不腰疼
Easy for you to say.

609
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,640
你和萨蒙妮有着完美的婚姻
You and Simone have the perfect marriage.

610
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,170
很难说
Oh, hardly.

611
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,310
有时萨蒙妮会后悔嫁给我
There are days when Simone regrets marrying me.

612
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,640
我说得对吗  亲爱的
Am I right, my darling?

613
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,210
-后悔的时候多着去了  -对  我想象她在梦中
- More than a few. - Yes, I imagine she dreams

614
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,860
用枕头闷死我
of stifling me with a pillow

615
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,890
或者把我像旧鞋一样扔掉
or casting me aside like an old shoe.

616
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,330
宝贝  你知道我从来不扔鞋子的
Oh, honey, you know I'd never throw away a shoe.

617
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,150
但你不会如此轻易摆脱我的
But you don't get rid of me that easily.

618
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,030
你们看  她在婚姻殿堂里把手交给了我
You see, she gave me her hand in marriage.

619
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,290
-卡尔  -我知道你永远不会放手的
- Karl... - And I'm never going to let it go.

620
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,620
真该死
Bloody hell!

621
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,130
汤米  你怎么笨手笨脚的
Tommy, how could you be so clumsy?

622
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,610
抱歉  格罗夫先生
Sorry, Mr. Grove.

623
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,360
我给您拿些餐巾纸
Let me get you some napkins.

624
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,860
很显然他是故意的
Clearly, he did that on purpose.

625
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,250
不是  他只是没注意而已
No, he just wasn't paying attention.

626
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,250
你知道青少年是怎样的
You know how teenagers are.

627
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,430
好了  清醒的人啊  到家了
Okay, sober person, here we go.

628
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,260
把外套给我
Give me this.

629
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,540
停下  伊莱  别催我
Stop. Hey. Eli, don't rush me.

630
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,860
我没催你
I'm not rushing you.

631
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,010
你知道吗  我不明白
You know what? I don't get it.

632
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,030
怎么了  你不明白什么
What's that? What don't you get?

633
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,330
我不明白洁德在这些人身上看到了什么
I don't get what Jade sees in those people.

634
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,040
-薇沙  -对
- Wischa? - Yeah.

635
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,730
他们假死了
They're fake as shit.

636
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,320
是的  好了  抬腿脱裤子
Yes, they are. Okay, legs, pants.

637
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:17,980
你知道吗
And you know what?

638
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,890
为什么有人想看他们穿内衣的样子
Why would anyone want to see them in their underwear?

639
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,140
因为他们根本不好看
'Cause they're not even that pretty.

640
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,410
你认为他们好看吗
Do you think they're pretty?

641
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,730
只有他们的身体和脸好看
Only their bodies and their faces.

642
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,310
而现在洁德要和他们一起去威尼斯
And now Jade's going with them to Venice?

643
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,120
去她妈的
Fuck her.

644
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,110
有什么好笑的
What's funny?

645
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,310
你  你很好笑  因为你喝醉了在胡闹
You. You're funny 'cause you're drunk and ridiculous,

646
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,170
这是一个不错的角色互换
and that's a nice change of pace.

647
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,350
怎么说
From what?

648
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,220
这个嘛  当我做傻事的时候通常
Well, usually you're the one taking care of me

649
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,690
都是你照顾我
when I'm doing something stupid.

650
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,100
-我确实照顾你  -没错
- I do take care of you. - Yes, you do.

651
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,250
-我照顾所有人  -好的
- I take care of everybody. - Okay.

652
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,500
明早别内疚  好吗
Hey, don't feel bad in the morning, okay?

653
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,790
我为什么要内疚
Why would I feel bad?

654
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,260
因为你会记起自己对洁德有多粗鲁
'Cause you'll remember how rude you were to Jade.

655
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,030
别担心  她会原谅你
Don't worry, she'll forgive you.

656
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
去你的
Mm, fuck you.

657
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,490
我也会
And so will I.

658
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,630
我真开心你来了  你美呆了
I am so happy you came. You look amazing.

659
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,340
谢谢你邀请我
It was very kind for you to invite me.

660
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,100
我从没来过这样的地方
I never go to places like this.

661
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,360
如果你不来  我就得待在家里
Well, if you hadn't come, I would've had to stay home,

662
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,720
那有什么意思呢
and where is the fun in that?

663
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,080
真遗憾你的男人不能来
It's a shame your fella couldn't make it.

664
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,350
嗯  他说自己要加班  谁知道呢
Yeah, he said he had to work late, but who knows?

665
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,300
出轨的已婚男人
Married men who cheat

666
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,930
撒谎技术也一流
also know how to lie.

667
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,160
这肯定令人难过
It must be frustrating.

668
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,360
不知道罗伯是否会为妻子爽你的约
Never knowing if Rob is going to stand you up for his wife.

669
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,610
确实有些烦人
It can be annoying,

670
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,000
但这是交易
but it's a trade-off.

671
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,750
那你从中得到什么好处
So what do you get out of the deal?

672
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,830
自由
Freedom.

673
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,510
你瞧  我不想结婚
See, I don't want to get married.

674
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,110
所以这只是
So this is just a...

675
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,330
随便玩玩
casual fling?

676
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,140
对  等我玩够了罗伯的妻子会得回他
Yeah. Rob's wife will get him back when I'm done with him,

677
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,280
完好如初
good as new.

678
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,270
如果他继续加班
And if he keeps working late,

679
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,210
那就是一两周的事儿
it's going to be in a couple of weeks.

680
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,960
厉害  你真行
Oh, good. For you.

681
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,720
我是说  真有你的
I mean, good for you.

682
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,030
我们的服务生呢
Where is our waiter?

683
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,960
那艾普尔  你为什么不想结婚
So, April, why don't you want to get married?

684
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,560
因为我想发展事业
Because I want to have a career.

685
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,600
做什么
Doing what?

686
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,340
我想做个歌手
I want to be a singer.

687
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,440
真的吗
Really?

688
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,400
所以我想来这里
That's kind of why I wanted to come here.

689
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,750
周末这里让女孩伴唱
They have girls that sing with the combo on the weekends,

690
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,950
我打算向经理毛遂自荐
so I'm gonna introduce myself to the manager,

691
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,040
然后
and then

692
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,210
我会给他试唱
I am going to audition for him.

693
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,850
我都不知道你会唱歌
I had no idea you sang.

694
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,340
我以前是家乡教堂唱诗班的
I started in the church choir back at home.

695
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,450
父老乡亲都觉得我很有才华
Folks there think I'm pretty talented.

696
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,210
有一天我会出人头地
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

697
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,030
你看着吧
You just watch.

698
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,950
我喜欢音乐
I love music.

699
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,200
我以前弹钢琴
I used to play the piano.

700
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,320
真的假的
No kidding.

701
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,920
嗯  我学了很多年
Yeah, I took lessons for years.

702
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,580
你还弹吗
Well, do you still play?

703
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,460
事实上
The truth is,

704
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,500
我丈夫不喜欢我弹琴
my husband didn't care for my playing.

705
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,690
我犯傻告诉他我想举行演奏会
I made the mistake of telling him I wanted to give a recital,

706
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,980
他嘲笑了我
and he just laughed.

707
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,730
他说我没有自己想象的那么厉害
He said I wasn't as good as I thought I was.

708
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,270
这打消了我的热情
That sort of took the wind out of my sail.

709
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,930
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

710
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,010
你丈夫死了
Your husband's dead.

711
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,270
你不觉得该停止听他的话吗
Don't you think it's time you stopped listening to him?

712
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,040
今晚来这我真的很开心
Can I just say I am very happy to be here tonight?

713
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,560
敬我们
Well, here's to us.

714
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,120
泰勒  你干什么
Taylor, what are you doing?

715
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,220
你说得对  我得去找洁德
You were right. I have to go find Jade.

716
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,250
现在凌晨4点
It's 4:00 in the morning.

717
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,830
我就是个贱人  现在她要去威尼斯
I was such a bitch, and now she's going to Venice,

718
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,280
这都是我的错  我得弥补
and it's all my fault, and I have to fix this.

719
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,770
行  但你都不知道她在哪
All right, well, you don't even know where she is.

720
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,990
我知道  好吗  她在他们的酒店
Yes, I do, okay? I-I... She's at their hotel.

721
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,120
-你怎么知道  -我在她手机上装了"找我朋友"
- How do you know that? - I put Find My Friends on her phone.

722
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,650
-你在追踪她  -我得走了
- You're tracking her? - I got to go.

723
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,230
我的天
Oh, my God.

724
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,460
你是中了什么邪
Hey, what the fuck has gotten into you?

725
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
我不能失去她
I can't lose her.

726
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,910
你可以等她回来再和她谈
Well, you can wait until she gets home to talk to her.

727
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,130
如果她不回来呢
What if she doesn't come back?

728
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,680
如果她已经坐上去威尼斯的飞机
What if she's already on a plane to Venice

729
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,980
我再也见不到她了呢
and I never see her again?

730
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,730
你刚说她在酒店
You just said she's at the hotel.

731
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,530
我需要她
I need her.

732
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,080
如果她走了  一切都会支离破碎
If she leaves, this whole fucking thing falls apart.

733
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,220
不
No...

734
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,750
不行
No.

735
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,130
停车
Stop the car.

736
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,460
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

737
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,780
一切都支离破碎
What whole thing falls apart?

738
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,580
伊莱  下去
Eli, get off.

739
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,380
不  你得给我出来
No, you're gonna get out

740
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,520
现在跟我谈谈  泰勒
and you're gonna talk to me right now, taylor.

741
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,790
真的吗
Really?

742
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,580
跟我谈谈  泰勒
Just talk to me, Taylor.

743
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,840
怎么了
What's going on?

744
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,460
拜托
Come on.

745
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,710
我之前问过你是否爱上她了
I asked you before if you were in love with her.

746
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,120
我知道  我知道
I-I know, I know.

747
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,110
-你骗了我  -也不是
- You lied to me. - Not exactly.

748
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,990
那我们在这儿干什么
Then what the hell are we doing in the driveway?

749
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,020
伊莱  拜托  求你了
Eli, come on, please.

750
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,560
这  这太艰难了
This is, this is too hard!

751
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,460
-什么  -我不知道
- What? - I-I don't know.

752
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,180
-什么事  -我的生活  我的生活太艰难了
- What? - My life, my l... my life is so hard!

753
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,840
我每天要工作那么久  接的案子又糟心
I-I... The hours I work, the cases I take.

754
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,680
然后回到这个房子
And then I come home to this house.

755
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,130
这个我们负担不起的大房子
This big, fucking house that we can't afford!

756
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,450
房贷的钱得我出
And I have to pay for it

757
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,290
因为你已经有两年没卖出过剧本了
because you haven't sold a script in two years.

758
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,160
但我不能提起这事
But I can't bring that up

759
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,840
不然我就成了坏人了
because then I'm a bitch.

760
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,400
所以我绝口不提
So I say nothing.

761
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,120
而洁德是我生活里唯一轻松的事
And Jade is the only thing in my life that is easy.

762
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,330
因为她不索取
'Cause she doesn't take.

763
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,510
她只给予
She only gives.

764
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,060
如果她离开  我不知道我会怎么做
If she leaves, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

765
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,700
你怎么不早点跟我说这些
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?

766
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,770
拜托
Come on.

767
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,570
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

768
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,420
好明智的决定
Oh, well, great call.

769
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,090
因为你伤到我了
'Cause it hurts.

770
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,550
那...
So, I mean...

771
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,760
你想我走吗
Do you want me to go?

772
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,330
不
No.

773
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,660
伊莱  我爱你
Eli, I love you.

774
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,650
但你想让她留下
But you want her to stay.

775
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,460
我
I mean...

776
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,750
这样要怎么成
How does that even work?

777
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,900
我不知道
I don't know.

778
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,070
真的
I don't.

779
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,040
但必须成
But it has to.

780
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,060
不然跟我做夫妻太难了
Because otherwise, it's just too hard to be married to me.

781
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,100
不  伊莱
No. Eli...

782
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,620
我被炒了
I got fired.

783
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,010
一点不意外  你的行为太幼稚了
I'm not surprised. What you did was childish.

784
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,310
-他当时抓着你  -他是握着我的手
- He was grabbing you. - He was holding my hand.

785
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,210
-你为什么一直帮他说话  -我没有
- Why do you keep defending him? - I'm not.

786
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,580
他骗了你  背着你出轨
He's lied to you, he's cheated on you

787
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,940
还不肯离开你家
and he won't leave your home.

788
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,910
情况太复杂了
The situation is complicated.

789
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,760
是啊  因为根本不合逻辑
Well, yeah, it must be, because it makes no sense.

790
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,100
-你应该恨他  -我知道  只是
- You should hate him. - I know, I know, it's just...

791
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,350
他是我丈夫
He's my husband.

792
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,790
他忍受我的奢侈和无理取闹
He puts up with my extravagance and my nonsense.

793
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,310
他会在我最需要赞美的时候夸我漂亮
He tells me I'm beautiful when I need to hear it the most and...

794
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,000
他可以用独一无二的方式逗我笑
he makes me laugh in a way that no one else can.

795
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,370
萨蒙妮
Simone...

796
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,260
我总有一天会和卡尔离婚的
One day, I will divorce Karl,

797
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,960
但我永远不会恨他
but I will never hate him,

798
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,100
因为我做不到
because I can't.

799
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,670
那我怎么办
Where does that leave me?

800
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,870
在餐车上
In the back of a van

801
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,390
度过欢愉时光
having a marvelous time.

802
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,480
餐车是公司配的
Yeah, well, van came with the job, so...

803
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,550
别担心
Don't worry.

804
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,520
我们会想办法解决的
We'll figure it out.

805
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,000
格罗夫太太
Mrs. Grove.

806
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,240

808
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,680

809
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,560
那个  关于今晚  我很抱歉
Listen, about tonight, I'm so sorry.

810
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,100
-你不必道歉  -不  有必要
- You don't have to apologize. - No, I do.

811
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,330
真的
I really do.

812
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,970
谢谢
Thank you.

813
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,150
我决定和米沙还有薇珞去威尼斯

814
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,330
是时候了
It's time.

815
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,930
跟你和伊莱生活在一起
Being here with you and Eli, it's...

816
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,150
这里让我几乎有了家的感觉
...starting to feel like a home.

817
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,460
我产生了感情
I'm getting attached.

818
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,980
最后我总是会受伤
Which always leads to me getting hurt.

819
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,560
在结束的时候
When it ends. So...

820
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,140
我应该离开
I should go.

821
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,070
如果不需要结束呢
What if it doesn't have to end?

822
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,430
如果你能留下呢
What if you stayed?

823
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,390
如果这就是你家呢
What if this was your home?

824
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,980
把这当做你家
Here with us.

我重新做了整个项目  花了好久

你想的话我可以给你做点心

不用  我去弄杯马天尼  然后洗个澡
No. I'm gonna make myself a martini, take a shower

839
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,080
就睡觉

840
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,820

我弹会儿钢琴可以吗

已经过了午夜了
It's after midnight.

843

844

再找找
Check again.

850

亲爱的

没有橄榄
It's not really a martini

852
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,040
