1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,240
They're ready now.

2
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,040
Perhaps we could begin with
your earliest recollections

3
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
of the events of last May.

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,280
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Could you move the microphone
a little closer?

6
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
Here?

7
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,400
I first got involved on the 15th.

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,240
<i>Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended</i>

9
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>the government's stance
on disability benefits</i>

10
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>as outrage over the death of so-called
"Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.</i>

11
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>More than 20,000 people
have signed a petition</i>

12
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
<i>demanding the sacking
of newspaper columnist Jo Powers</i>

13
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,440
<i>following her controversial article
about Gwen Marbury.</i>

14
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
<i>Conservationists have announced
another extinction.</i>

15
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
<i>The Siberian crane has died out</i>

16
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
<i>following an unprecedented reduction
in its wetland habitat.</i>

17
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects
known as ADls</i>

18
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,760
<i>have been activated
for their second summer.</i>

19
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,160
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.

20
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.

21
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
Yo Powers?

22
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>Jo </i>Powers.

23
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,640
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?

24
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
That's from bakery. For you.

25
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Hello, darling!

27
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Creative, your well-wishers.

28
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
Don't eat it.

29
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,880
It's a cake. That's its job.

30
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm going to have a bath.

31
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah!

32
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,920
<i> Grammy-award-winning</i>
<i>rapper Tusk is still with us.</i>

33
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,760
<i>Now, Tusk,
there are loads of online videos</i>

34
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,160
<i>of people trying to emulate you,</i>

35
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,600
<i>but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.</i>

36
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,400
<i>It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.</i>

37
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,880
<i> That is one goofy-looking kid.</i>

38
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,840
<i>Not a good dancer.</i>

39
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,040
<i>He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.</i>

40
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,600
<i>That young motherfucker can't dance
for shit.</i>

41
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,080
<i>He should probably just give up
now, actually.</i>

42
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840
<i>Don't hate on me for keeping it real.</i>

43
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
<i>That's a goofy little motherfucker,
and he can't dance for shit.</i>

44
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
<i> He is a big fan, Tusk.</i>

45
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,080
<i> Don't hate on your boy.</i>

46
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
<i>Everybody's got to start somewhere.</i>

47
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
<i> Start somewhere?</i>
<i>I looked better than that...</i>

48
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,960
- DCI Parke?
- No press.

49
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,920
No, I'm not press. Um... TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.

50
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,080
My shadow? They said...

51
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,800
Sorry. Call me Karin.

52
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.

53
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,640
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah. It's not a nickname.

54
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,840
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.

55
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.

56
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,400
- On video, I mean.
- Boss?

57
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,360
This is Blue. She's my shadow.

58
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,120
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?

59
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,800
- Jo Powers.
- As in...

60
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
As in actual Jo Powers.

61
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,760
Saw something she wrote the other day
about the wheelchair woman.

62
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,440
Clickbait piece. Pissed people off.

63
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,840
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.

64
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,040
To get her sacked.

65
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,120
Come on.

66
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Neighbours heard her screaming
and called it in.

67
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
Hell of a struggle.

68
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Anyone else at home?

69
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,680
Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.

70
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,320
- By her?
- Don't know.

71
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,680
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.

72
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
Her mentions are still pouring in.

73
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
Restraining bolt's in place.

74
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,000
- No other points of entry?
- No. But the outside's ringed with CCTV.

75
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,600
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.

76
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,040
Okay, then. Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

77
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Full autop for her, and we question
the husband as soon as he wakes up.

78
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,440
Come on.

79
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,440
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.

80
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.

81
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.

82
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,880
These things are almost always
either drink, drugs or domestic.

83
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,360
It is how it is.

84
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,000
- You driving home?
- No license. Never passed.

85
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm sort of waiting for driverless
to go mainstream.

86
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,960
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.

87
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,280
- Get in.
- Oh. Okay.

88
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,600
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

89
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,920
What happened,
you get bored of it?

90
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,240
Not exactly. You've seen
what people tuck away on these.

91
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,600
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.

92
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm old enough to remember
when they walked around with that stuff

93
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,640
just tucked away in their heads.

94
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,800
Right. But now they can't help but
entrusting it to their little companions.

95
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,240
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.

96
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
If it's interesting,
why leave Forensics?

97
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
The Rannoch case.

98
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,080
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.

99
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,400
I was the one
who cracked his souvenir folder.

100
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,960
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
And the videos too. Saw them all.

102
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,720
You see something like that,
it changes you.

103
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You either get defeated or you think...

104
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,280
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."

105
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,880
Yeah.

106
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,440
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?

107
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,560
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world,

108
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,480
you can genuinely prevent stuff,
can't you?

109
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,200
You are young.

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
Maybe you're old?

111
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,160
Steady.

112
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
Thanks.

113
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,280
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.

114
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
<i>Jo Powers has been found</i>
<i>dead at her home in West London.</i>

115
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
<i>The veteran columnist had been
at the centre of controversy</i>

116
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,600
<i>over an article she'd written about
disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.</i>

117
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,720
<i>The police have yet to confirm the cause...</i>

118
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,680
It's just the first floor,
first door on the...

119
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

120
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

121
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,360
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.

122
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.

123
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,840
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.

124
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,080
They'd have to climb the fence,
make it in and out,

125
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,400
knowing the camera wasn't working,

126
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,320
but yeah, could have happened. Technically.

127
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay, sorry.

128
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,840
You're keen to help.

129
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,840
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.

130
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Um... So...

131
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm collating every threat
or insult levelled at Jo Powers

132
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,160
over the previous 48 hours.

133
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,960
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

134
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,920
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

135
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Stress levels in that household
would've been through the roof.

136
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,880
That Internet stuff
drifts off like weather.

137
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,000
It's half hate. They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

138
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,400
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.

139
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,280
- Yeah. I'm divorced.
- Um...

140
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,440
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.

141
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,960
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

142
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,680
And when I ran in, she was walking
'round the room, stumbling.

143
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,480
She was clutching... She was clutching
her head as if she was in pain.

144
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,600
And then for a moment, she stopped.

145
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,200
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

146
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,320
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

147
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,840
And she turned...

148
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,040
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

149
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,800
Then she... she pushed me over.

150
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,440
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

151
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,680
Then she picked it up,
and she started cutting herself.

152
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
Here. She was gouging.

153
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,480
I tried to stop her.

154
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
But she did this.

155
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,160
Then she cut her throat.

156
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,960
I tried to stop her.

157
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,480
She cut her own throat with the glass!

158
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,560
Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

159
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,600
I'd say the odds are against that.

160
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,560
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

161
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
Maybe there was something in the cake.

162
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

163
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,360
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

164
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,040
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

165
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,800
He was sort of convincing.

166
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."

167
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,720
He's ordinary. That <i>is </i>the type.

168
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,720
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

169
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,240
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...

170
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
- Blue.
- What?

171
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,240
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.

172
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,920
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

173
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,920
Got the name this morning.

174
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,000
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.

175
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,760
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

176
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,200
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends,

177
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,840
that's most of the job.

178
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,280
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just...

179
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,480
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

180
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,480
Okay, that<i> was</i> patronizing.

181
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,200
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.

182
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,640
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

183
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,040
"Death to Jo Powers."
She posted that on Monday morning.

184
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,800
The bakery said that they're
not meant to do obscenities,

185
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,760
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing,

186
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,040
and they agreed, so...

187
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,600
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

188
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,080
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

189
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,720
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?

190
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

191
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,720
I held a sort of whip-round.

192
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,440
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

193
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,000
From 80 other people?

194
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,560
Look, I'm not...

195
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,360
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.

196
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,240
But did you read what she had written?

197
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,680
How much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

198
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
I don't know.

199
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,080
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

200
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,080
It was funny, okay?

201
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,000
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird,

202
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,800
but I'm not mental.

203
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,760
You wished she was dead.

204
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,240
Well, uh...

205
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
No, no, I didn't.

206
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,920
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...

207
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,800
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like "Death to..."

208
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,160
You insert the name
of someone who's being an arsehole.

209
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

210
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,520
And who started it? The hashtag?

211
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,560
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

212
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,600
Excuse us a moment.

213
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,160
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

214
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,160
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."

215
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,680
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

216
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,560
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

217
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,880
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

218
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,600
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

219
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,280
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

220
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
We'll bring him in for questioning.

221
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Blue? We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

222
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

223
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,040
Tusk.

224
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,440
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

225
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

226
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,440
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

227
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,320
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

228
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,440
Whoo!

229
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,840
Where my ladies at?

230
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,120
- Yo! Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.

231
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,520
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?

232
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.

233
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,360
A'ight.

234
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,920
Damn!

235
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,680
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

236
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,920
Don't stress. It's legal here.

237
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Pfft! Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

238
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,240
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.

239
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,960
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

240
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,480
Always doing some bullshit.

241
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,800
Tusk? Tusk?

242
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

243
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,880
- I got you.
- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

244
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
Call an ambulance!

245
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,440
Commencing.

246
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.

247
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
- Good morning.
- Morning.

248
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,280
She's in here.

249
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,840
So I go in,

250
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,880
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

251
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,240
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

252
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,040
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

253
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

254
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,160
Where I find this.

255
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,000
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

256
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.

257
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,960
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

258
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,400
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

259
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,280
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.

260
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,960
It crawled right through
her dorsal posterior insula,

261
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,920
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

262
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
You're talking agony off the scale.

263
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,320
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.

264
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,280
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

265
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,880
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay. Thank you.

266
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,480
They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

267
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,240
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

268
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,040
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

269
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

270
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,720
Let me guess,
this is some people on the Internet?

271
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,880
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

272
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
There's a schizophrenic world view.

273
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,360
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future,

274
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,760
but here I fucking well am.

275
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,840
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.

276
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,120
Vanessa Dahl.

277
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,120
Please. Follow me.

278
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,160
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADls?

279
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,880
That's right.

280
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,480
Any particular reason?

281
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,360
Yes.

282
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Rasmus.

283
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Rasmus Sjoberg.

284
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,560
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

285
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

286
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,160
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.

287
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,680
So, your bees, your ADis,
talk me through them.

288
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,480
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

289
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,480
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

290
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,680
so what our ADis do
is effectively stand in for them.

291
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,880
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

292
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,760
But they pollinate flowers the same way.

293
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,880
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

294
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,000
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

295
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,560
- Can they make honey?
- Uh... No.

296
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,360
I was joking.

297
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,480
How do they know
where the flowers even are? I mean...

298
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,840
Well, they have a sensor.

299
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,000
Like a... camera?

300
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,840
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

301
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,440
You see,
they need rudimentary pattern recognition

302
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,360
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

303
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
<i>- They</i> navigate?
- Yes.

304
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,160
You don't... I don't know... steer them?

305
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,800
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

306
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

307
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,800
Yes. You see, the ADis
cover the whole of the UK.

308
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,480
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

309
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,160
It's just not logistically possible.

310
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,200
No. We simply
set the behaviour and leave them to it.

311
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,200
They even construct these hives
themselves.

312
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,440
They reproduce...

313
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,160
- They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

314
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,520
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.

315
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
They create duplicates of themselves,

316
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,800
create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

317
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,440
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

318
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,320
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

319
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,040
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

320
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,720
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

321
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,480
Bees were dying out.

322
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,880
So, what is it that brings you here?

323
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,280
We think one of your ADis
may be involved in an unexplained death.

324
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,320
Sorry? A death?

325
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
Uh-huh.

326
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,240
Thank you.

327
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah. It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...

328
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,720
Kill people? I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

329
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,600
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

330
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,040
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

331
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,920
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

332
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
That's impossible.

333
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,880
You see,
it's got military-grade encryption,

334
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,480
and you would need a diagnostic
controller, which is also encrypted.

335
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,280
So I would say the likelihood is...

336
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,680
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as "impossible."

337
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,120
This is every hive we have online.

338
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
See...

339
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,480
These are the hives in the building here.

340
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,240
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

341
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,640
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.

342
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,520
Is that the search input?

343
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,640
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.

344
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,120
Jo Powers' postcode.

345
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,880
Is that who this is about?

346
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,800
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

347
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,920
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

348
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,120
You know, put them in the microwave
for YouTube videos.

349
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,920
And this logs
any that drop off the system?

350
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,040
Logs everything, yes.

351
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,200
Did you lose any around here
on Monday evening?

352
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,600
Well, I can check.

353
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,920
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.

354
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,760
There.

355
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,800
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

356
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
When they pass between hives,

357
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,400
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

358
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,520
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?

359
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,160
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

360
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,000
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

361
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,160
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

362
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,680
What's the range on one of those?

363
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,760
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

364
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,920
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

365
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,200
- Outside the house.
- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

366
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,960
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

367
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Uh...

368
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,400
You know what? Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.

369
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
Okay.

370
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,960
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

371
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,280
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be... hypothetically speaking?

372
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem,

373
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,280
and we'd need approval
from the Department of the Environment.

374
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,000
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system,

375
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,160
past or present.

376
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,160
Some were government employees.

377
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,800
if it helps.

378
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,840
Bye.

379
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,840
Nick, that's a set
of Granular personnel records.

380
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
Root out anyone interesting.

381
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,120
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.

382
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,920
Technically we should refer this up
to the NCA,

383
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,360
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

384
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,800
The NCA already knows about it.

385
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
What?

386
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,840
DCI Karin Parke?

387
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,720
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

388
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,040
How come you're here?

389
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,640
There's been more than one.

390
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
This is Tusk, last night.

391
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,800
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

392
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,960
Took him to the hospital.

393
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,840
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

394
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,360
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

395
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,120
so they popped him in the MRI.

396
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,920
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

397
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,160
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

398
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,280
Battered the ADI too.

399
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,560
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

400
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,160
It's evidence.

401
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,640
Two's a pattern. It knocks
any malfunction theory in the head.

402
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,720
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

403
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,120
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

404
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,560
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

405
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,720
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

406
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,280
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.

407
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,080
Fuck.

408
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
Fuck.

409
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,920
Guys? Come here.

410
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,240
Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,

411
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,640
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours,

412
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,280
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

413
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,960
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

414
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,480
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

415
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,320
She didn't know where she'd first heard
of it, but trace it back,

416
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,080
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

417
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,200
- By who?
- Uh...

418
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,000
Looks like, um...

419
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,160
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

420
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,160
Um...

421
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,640
Automated. It's like spam.

422
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,320
This is someone trying to seed the tag,
you know? Get it out there.

423
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,240
It's like bait. This is someone
wanting people to pick up on it.

424
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,240
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

425
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,960
Bees. Shit.

426
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,640
Okay.

427
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,880
There's more.

428
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,640
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

429
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,040
- Uh-huh.
- There.

430
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,400
"Game of Consequences"?

431
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,680
It's like an unpopularity contest.

432
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,080
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name,

433
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,120
then that's who gets targeted.

434
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Here, watch.

435
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,640
<i> Game of Consequences.</i>

436
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,320
<i>- One: Pick a target.</i>
- Oh, my God.

437
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,600
<i>Two: Post their name and photo
with #DeathTo.</i>

438
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
No.

439
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,520
<i>Three: Most popular target
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.</i>

440
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,560
<i>Four: Game resets at midnight.</i>

441
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,480
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.

442
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,480
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

443
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,160
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.

444
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,120
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag
on Jo Powers, okay?

445
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,520
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

446
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,520
- Who's using it now?
- There's... There's loads more people.

447
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,560
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

448
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,400
- Yeah.
- Um...

449
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,240
But at number one...

450
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,760
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

451
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,920
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

452
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,880
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo,

453
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,640
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial.

454
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,960
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.

455
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah, it's getting near the end
of the vote,

456
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,280
and her mentions are blowing up.

457
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,400
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

458
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,440
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.

459
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,120
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.

460
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,240
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

461
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,640
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

462
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,400
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

463
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
There.

464
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,360
Hello?

465
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,760
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.

466
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,640
Clara!

467
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,480
Police. For you.
How did they get my number?

468
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,240
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?

469
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,840
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

470
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,280
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

471
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,120
Sorry, is this a joke? Because
all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

472
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,880
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

473
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,680
And keep your windows closed.

474
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm setting up a perimeter.

475
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,920
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

476
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,080
- Rasmus?
<i>- Hi, Blue.</i>

477
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,240
<i>I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.</i>

478
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,000
I need you to monitor the area.

479
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,200
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADis, yeah?

480
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,360
<i>Yeah, great, good.</i>

481
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,360
Look, if they come back,

482
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,160
I think I can catch them.

483
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,200
<i>I have basically set a trap.</i>

484
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,120
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.

485
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,840
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

486
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,240
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

487
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,200
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

488
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,760
Let's go.

489
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,800
We can take her here.

490
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,960
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

491
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,520
<i> No target sighted.</i>

492
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,680
<i>This is a police operation!</i>

493
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,080
<i>Everybody vacate their premises now.</i>

494
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,280
<i>Please leave...</i>

495
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,520
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.

496
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,920
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.

497
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,320
Granular, they've got a breach.

498
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,720
- <i> One ADI just went offline.</i>
- Where?

499
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,600
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

500
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,360
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

501
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,360
they're gonna turn 'round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

502
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,920
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

503
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,040
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

504
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,800
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

505
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,440
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

506
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,960
Just gotta call in.

507
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,600
Hi.

508
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,080
No, not yet.

509
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,000
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

510
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,720
Understood.

511
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,840
They housed a witness here for a while,
Shaun said.

512
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,560
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?

513
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,720
No.

514
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,400
No plans.

515
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,680
Up the stairs.

516
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,240
- Rasmus.
<i>- Still nothing. I can't trace it.</i>

517
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,520
At least there's an en-suite.

518
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,240
- Is there nothing?
<i>-  No.</i>

519
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,000
<i>Whoever it is,
they've masked their path well.</i>

520
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,360
But that's not...

521
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,280
- Fuck.
<i>-  What?</i>

522
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,360
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

523
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,800
<i>Packed full of ADls.</i>

524
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,160
Lost them all too.

525
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,080
- No... Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.

526
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,160
- Where?
- It's close to your location.

527
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,640
Rasmus, say that again.

528
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,080
Blue? Blue. It's close...
It's very close to you.

529
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,400
- Text it. Text it to me.
- Rasmus. Text it to... Shit.

530
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,600
Do I get to redecorate?

531
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,640
Hello. Hello.

532
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,240
No...

533
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,440
They've got the whole thing.

534
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,560
We're not in control anymore.

535
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,240
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?

536
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,040
- Fix it! Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!

537
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,800
Shit.

538
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,160
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

539
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,960
Go. Go, go, go.

540
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,280
What's... what's happening?

541
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,000
Karin...

542
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,800
In there! Go!

543
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,960
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!

544
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,240
You're scaring the shit out of me!

545
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,360
Oh! Fuck!

546
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,000
The fan! The fan!

547
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,800
Get it away from me!

548
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
Take your time.

549
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,760
I'd seen so many bodies before.

550
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,240
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

551
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,360
But I'd never seen anyone die.

552
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,320
And she was right there.

553
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,240
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

554
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,360
Blue took it hard.

555
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,800
Uh-huh.

556
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,160
I'll shut it down.

557
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,880
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

558
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,080
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

559
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,480
But there were thousands of them.

560
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,480
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.

561
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,480
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.

562
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,280
Whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

563
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,080
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.

564
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,840
You need to fucking sort this out!

565
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,600
How do the ADis know who to target?

566
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,360
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database?

567
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,360
No. That just gives you the basic area.

568
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,160
We were in the room too,
and they only went for her.

569
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,960
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

570
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,280
Which means the feed from their visual
sensors, that's been accessed too.

571
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,080
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.

572
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,160
Now look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

573
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,040
- There you go.
- Although...

574
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,640
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

575
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,760
Okay. Enough.

576
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,400
We had to consent to permitting
government security services

577
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,560
access to the visual feed at times
of quote, "increased national security."

578
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,320
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

579
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,560
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

580
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,560
That implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

581
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,480
- So they<i> are</i> spying on us.
- This is all classified.

582
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,480
So what did you do, did you put in
a back door and route it through GCHQ?

583
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,520
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

584
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,480
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

585
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,200
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

586
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,160
Well, that's great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

587
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,680
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

588
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,280
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
and it grabs 200 green votes.

589
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,320
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

590
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,040
Total nationwide surveillance.

591
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,600
We tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

592
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,280
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

593
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,400
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

594
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,360
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

595
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,080
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us,

596
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,840
but no,
you kept your little fucking secret.

597
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,840
Okay! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

598
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,520
Word's going to get out about Clara.

599
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,160
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on,

600
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,560
and soon we're going to have another body.

601
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,200
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

602
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,360
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

603
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,000
If I can work out how they got in,

604
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,240
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

605
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,080
Do the ADis have a command log,
on-board cache?

606
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,360
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.

607
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,120
Been through the employee files,
found some POls.

608
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,040
Bring them in.

609
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,520
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

610
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,760
I've got to be somewhere.

611
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,480
<i> It's 7:15.</i>

612
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,160
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

613
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,200
<i>Controversial journalist Jo Powers...</i>

614
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,080
<i> Good morning.</i>
<i>Have you posted the hashtag?</i>

615
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,760
<i>Is it real or an urban myth?</i>

616
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,840
<i>Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?</i>

617
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,040
<i>People are dying,</i>
<i>and</i> we<i> want to hear your thoughts.</i>

618
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,680
<i>Line seven, Liana...</i>

619
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,280
<i>This is real, this is happening...</i>

620
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,440
<i>I am happy to see her die.</i>

621
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,200
<i> It's not the hashtag killing them.</i>
<i>That's just a game.</i>

622
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,600
<i>Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.</i>

623
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,200
<i> Steve, line five.</i>

624
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,000
<i> Yeah, but my point is,</i>
<i>someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?</i>

625
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,160
<i>So why not make it someone,
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.</i>

626
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,080
<i> With the hashtag, I've seen</i>
<i>celebrities, politicians, everyone.</i>

627
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,200
<i>This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.</i>

628
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,400
<i>The point is this is already happening.</i>

629
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,880
<i>And people know that they can jump on board</i>

630
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,320
<i>because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.</i>

631
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,200
<i>Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.</i>

632
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,520
<i>As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,</i>

633
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,320
<i>and I want us to think about that.</i>

634
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,560
<i>What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?</i>

635
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,440
<i> Well, I can't say I'm surprised</i>
<i>that he's number one on the list.</i>

636
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,760
<i>He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.</i>

637
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,160
<i> But does that warrant</i>
<i>his place on this list?</i>

638
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,920
<i> I'm saying people</i>
<i>don't have to think too hard about it.</i>

639
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,120
<i>Now that's he's number one,</i>

640
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,760
<i>that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.</i>

641
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,520
Thanks for your time.

642
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,320
- No good?
- No good.

643
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,280
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

644
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,640
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

645
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,880
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

646
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,360
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

647
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,040
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

648
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,080
Farrington's number four,
and he's a paedophile.

649
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,400
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

650
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,080
Let's just shut it down. All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

651
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,040
Just for today,

652
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,720
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

653
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,120
and he actually catches someone.

654
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,120
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

655
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,760
- But it's possible? We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

656
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,280
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

657
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,400
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.

658
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,680
- No?
- Not in my opinion.

659
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,360
Right, okay. It's just that speaking
as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

660
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,760
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

661
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

662
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,400
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

663
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,760
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

664
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,160
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report? The archive job?

665
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,240
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

666
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,120
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.

667
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,040
Tom, that would be a smear.

668
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,160
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

669
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,760
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

670
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,360
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.

671
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,680
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

672
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,560
I'll show you.

673
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,960
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

674
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,880
So not much
in the way of technical skills.

675
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,840
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

676
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,160
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

677
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,560
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,
said he'd harassed her,

678
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,760
lewd comments or something.

679
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,200
Turned out he had a learning disability
so she caught a ton of shit on...

680
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,760
On social media.

681
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,120
- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

682
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,720
It was like having a whole weather system
turn against me.

683
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,200
Just hate message after hate message,
around the clock, all piling on.

684
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,720
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

685
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,720
Suddenly
there's a million invisible people,

686
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,080
all talking about how they despise you.

687
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,360
It's like a mental illness.

688
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:28,920
Fuck.

689
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,960
What?

690
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,280
Shit.

691
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,440
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

692
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,000
but the way people enjoyed kicking me,
that's what got to me.

693
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,480
The casual fun they had and, um...

694
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,880
I just felt I couldn't go on.

695
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,800
Who found you?

696
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,560
Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

697
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,800
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I'd slashed them.

698
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,680
I mean, it's crazy.

699
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,360
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath,

700
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,760
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, "I'm naked."

701
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,600
He tied towels 'round my wrists,
kept me conscious,

702
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,760
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

703
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,000
Sort of weird.

704
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,560
I think he always had a thing for me.

705
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,560
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

706
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,160
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

707
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,960
- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?

708
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,120
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

709
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,160
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

710
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,360
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

711
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,760
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers' ADI.

712
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,560
- What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

713
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,320
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

714
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,520
<i> So we're good to go?</i>

715
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,360
<i>Okay, that's the charge in place.</i>

716
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,440
Okay. Pull back.

717
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,560
<i>We're all set here.</i>

718
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,800
Detonate.

719
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,680
So, the plan is,
we move you to an underground bunker,

720
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,960
knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

721
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,960
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

722
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,920
It's a temporary measure.

723
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,800
How long till you take out all the hives?

724
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,400
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

725
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,320
Two years, a victim a day.

726
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,440
More to the point,
the environmental impact would...

727
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,160
Fuck that.

728
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,760
<i> Shit!</i>

729
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,400
<i>- What?
- Fuck!</i>

730
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,800
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

731
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,200
<i>Get back!</i>

732
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,840
<i>Go, go, go! Get away!</i>

733
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,880
<i>For fuck's sake, move!</i>

734
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,880
What's your Plan B?

735
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,560
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

736
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,040
He left the country six months ago.

737
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,960
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

738
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,560
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

739
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,840
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

740
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,120
"Thanks to the technological revolution,"

741
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,040
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

742
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:01,640
Only by being forced to recognize
the power technology grants us,

743
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,960
"to acknowledge
individual responsibility..."

744
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,920
Is it all like this?

745
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,560
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty,

746
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,160
that it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

747
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,320
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

748
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,200
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

749
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,960
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

750
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,320
Well, fuck him.

751
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,600
Fuck.

752
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,680
Shit.

753
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,200
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

754
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,960
He's put this document
together himself, right?

755
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,360
His author name's in the metadata.

756
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,040
But he stripped out everything else,

757
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,200
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

758
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,160
Mm-hmm.

759
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,960
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

760
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,480
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

761
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,440
He's taken it with his phone,
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

762
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,320
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

763
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,520
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

764
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,920
- Armed police! Stay down!
- Armed police!

765
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,440
Armed police! Stay where you are!
Armed police! Show yourselves!

766
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,040
Move!

767
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,560
Left.

768
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,200
- Clear!
- Clear!

769
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,000
Clear!

770
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,600
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

771
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,600
There. The forge.

772
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,600
Nice one.

773
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,640
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

774
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,800
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

775
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,280
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

776
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,040
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

777
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,160
Well, I've got his source code.

778
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,520
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

779
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,320
Key to the door?

780
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,480
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

781
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,960
Well, I'm in.

782
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,960
Okay. Deactivate her.

783
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,600
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

784
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,920
That's weird.

785
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,440
What's weird?

786
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,640
- Time's ticking.
- That file. Wasn't there before.

787
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,320
- This file?
- Yeah.

788
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
What is it?

789
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,160
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

790
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,560
What does that mean?

791
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:50,720
Every phone, every device
has a unique number, an IMEI number.

792
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,960
It tethers it to a unique user.

793
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,480
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

794
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,880
Take it easy.

795
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,480
Who are these people?

796
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,560
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.

797
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,800
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

798
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,960
- No! Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

799
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,480
Wait. Wait.

800
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,960
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.

801
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,200
- Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

802
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,720
Fuck's sake.

803
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,280
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

804
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,360
What?

805
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,680
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

806
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,320
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

807
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,200
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

808
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,160
- See if I'm on there.
- What?

809
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,400
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

810
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,200
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

811
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,080
Yeah, you're there.

812
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,840
Almost there.

813
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,360
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

814
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,120
Okay. I'm ready.

815
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,640
- Shit.
- Run it now.

816
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,560
No. Think. He left us a trail.

817
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,640
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts,

818
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,200
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

819
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,760
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

820
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,280
something to do with that list.

821
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,600
What if those are his real targets?

822
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,120
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.

823
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,560
Consequences.

824
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,000
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.

825
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,400
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?

826
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,600
- Run it.
- No!

827
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,160
Yeah.

828
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,560
Yeah, it worked.

829
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,120
Sorry, but that needed doing.

830
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,880
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

831
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,600
No. No.

832
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,560
- Fuck!
- No.

833
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,040
Shit.

834
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,120
Oh, no.

835
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,560
There's...

836
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:08,400
We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

837
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,880
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

838
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,800
of the loss of life that followed.

839
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,560
No. No, we don't.

840
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,000
And what became of Ms. Colson?

841
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,560
I think she blamed herself.

842
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,480
No. I know she did.

843
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:22,880
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb
trail and sprung the whole thing.

844
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,080
She left the force.

845
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,320
I didn't hear from her.

846
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,200
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

847
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,960
Then, um...

848
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,840
About four months later,
they found her things.

849
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,560
On a beach.

850
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
With a note.

851
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,200
She killed herself?

852
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,400
That's the base theory, yes.

853
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:32,840
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you

854
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,400
for sharing your testimony and your time.

855
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,480
Thank you.

856
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,040
Thank you.

857
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,800
Señor.

858
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,600
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
