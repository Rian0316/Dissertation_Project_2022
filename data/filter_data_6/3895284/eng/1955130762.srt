1
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:05,546

2
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,114
- Thanks, Jimmy.

3
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,788
- Trina.
- Hey, Jimmy.

4
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,917
- Got a package, Dan.

5
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,335
How's it going?

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,087
What's up?

7
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,360

8
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,358
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

9
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,320
Jimmy, I'm really slammed.
Just tell me what you need.

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,328
What is it?

11
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,421
I can't open it.

12
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,673

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,777
So, what does it say?

14
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,783

15
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,912

16
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,491
"I must call to your
attention the newly passed...

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,795
...Environmental Impact and
Sustainability Assurance Act...

18
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,998
...a statute that as you know,
went into effect without any...

19
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,004
...ex post facto provisions in place."

20
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,585
- You got a second?
- Not really. I'm-

21
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,263
- It'll just take two seconds, I promise.
- All right.

22
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,141
What's this?

23
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,475

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,728
- Is this a joke?
- Nope. No joke.

25
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,025
You passed the bar?

26
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,401
Yeah. <i>I</i> did.

27
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,948
I thought if Kim can do it,
maybe I can too, you know?

28
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,156
So I got my last few credits for
undergrad from a community college.

29
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,163
They're not just for draft dodgers
and yoga classes, all right?

30
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,870
Then I found a law school
that would accept me.

31
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,376
I mean, it wasn't
Georgetown or anything.

32
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,627

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,878
The University of American Samoa.

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,805
- Oh, correspondence school.
- Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right?

35
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,507
Nights. Weekends. You know.

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,764
They call it distance learning nowadays.
They're accredited.

37
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:01,018
Go, Land Crabs.
So you know, I did that.

38
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,022
And the bar exam's a mother.
I mean, for me, it was.

39
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,822
I failed it the first two times,
but I guess it's like losing your virginity.

40
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,275
Third time's the charm.

41
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:16,163
This must have taken you years.
And you kept it a secret all this time?

42
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,537
Why? You didn't come to me for help?

43
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,247
Jesus, Chuck. You're the busiest guy
I know. You're doing important shit.

44
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:31,420
- Wow. I don't know what to say.
- Are you proud of me?

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,838
Hmm? Um...

46
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,265
Yes. Absolutely.

47
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,140
Thanks, Chuck. That means a lot.

48
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,688
Oh, hey. I was hoping, you know,
if you think it's appropriate...

49
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:51,444
...once I get sworn in
and everything, consider hiring me.

50
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:55,158
As what? Oh, a lawyer.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,408
Obviously. Yeah.

52
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,662
That's a question I'm gonna have to take
up with Howard and the other partners.

53
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,747
Uh, you know,
it's not my decision alone.

54
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,798
But how could they say no?

55
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,344
So much drive.
Jimmy, look what you've done here.

56
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,507

57
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,810
- I told those guys devil's food.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,932
- I will sue the store for you.
- Good.

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,516
- Remember us when you're all big time.
- I don't remember you now, Burt.

60
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,149
You representing mail room. You show
those upstairs jackholes how it gets-

61
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,947
Hey. What're you folks up to?
Having a party?

62
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,994
Just a little celebration on behalf
of New Mexico's newest attorney.

63
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,913
I heard. Jesus, Jimmy.
You're a regular Charlie Hustle.

64
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,865
- Congratulations, my friend.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,370
- Would you like some cake?
- Oh, here.

66
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,122
Don't mind if I do.

67
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,298
Really, really impressive, Jimmy.
We're all proud of you.

68
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,343
I hate to interrupt, but could you
give Jimmy and me a moment?

69
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,887
- Sure.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

70
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,088

71
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,682
Please, sit down.

72
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,516

73
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,975
<i>Let's reassess in six months.</i>

74
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,098
Thanks for understanding, Jimmy.

75
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,430
You want the door opened or closed?

76
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,185
Closed.

77
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,314

78
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,860
How's it going?

79
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,939
- Settling back in.
- Great.

80
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,947
So apparently
they are ready for us.

81
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,197
Oh. Thanks.

82
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,574
But I wanted to get
some things done before lunch.

83
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:45,826
And I'm still trying to-

84
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,500
Come on, Kim. You deserve this.

85
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,831
Come bask in the glow.

86
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,504
Thank you for coming.</i>

87
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,007
<i>I appreciate you making time
in the middle of your days.</i>

88
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,680
<i>I'm pleased to announce
that working closely with...</i>

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,100
<i>...the Bernalillo County
District Attorney's Office...</i>

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,644
<i>...we've reached an agreement
for Craig Kettleman.</i>

91
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,189
<i>We believe this is a
just and fair outcome...</i>

92
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,269
<i>...and brings to a close an incident
Mr. Kettieman deeply regrets.</i>

93
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,319
<i>He is committed to making amends...</i>

94
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,646
Can I help you?

95
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,403
- Yeah. I'm here to see Mrs. Landry.
- Ah.

96
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,036
Sign in right here, please.

97
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,699
- Are you a relative?
- Lawyer.

98
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,749
- Ahem. But I treat my clients like family.
- Oh.

99
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,880
- You know where to find her? Ah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

100
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,422

101
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,723
Hey. Good morning, folks.
Hi. Jimmy McGill.

102
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,769
Uh, oh. Hey. Pick a card, any card.

103
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,846
All right.

104
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,183
How's it going there?
Good. Whoa, not so tight.

105
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,441
Oh. Shh.

106
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,903
A little surprise from the card fairy.

107
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,612
Give me that squeeze.

108
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:09,699
Squeeze whatever you got that's below
the water that I can't see. Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,952
All right, Mrs. Landry.

110
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:15,206
Just a few more signatures and,
uh, ahem, thy will be done.

111
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,038
Would you like another Hydrox?

112
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,841
No, thank you. I'm all Hydrox'd out.
Heh, heh.

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,338
Please help yourself
if you change your mind.

114
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,466
All right. That one.

115
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,432
Okay. And that one.

116
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,807
And that is it.

117
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,481
Oh. What a relief.
I should have done this years ago.

118
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,903
Well, people do tend to put it off.
But everybody should have a will.

119
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,150
Please tell your friends.

120
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,235
And that comes to $140.

121
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,037
And I'm happy to take cash or a cheque.

122
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,411
Or, uh, cash. Heh.

123
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,791
One moment.

124
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,893

125
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,145
Could you write me a cheque?

126
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,976
Well, it's been so long, I really don't
know if I have enough in my account.

127
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,654
I am so sorry. This is awful.

128
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,778
But all I have is $43.

129
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,033
- Okay.
- Now, I could ask for an advance.

130
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,864
I am so sorry.

131
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,370
- It's fine.
- I don't know what to say.

132
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,451
This is awful.

133
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,336
Oh. You could keep the will
until I get my allowance.

134
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,384
And that should only be
until the end of next week.

135
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,927
That's not necessary.

136
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,383
Here's my address. Mail it to me
when you've got it. All right?

137
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:58,099
And why don't we-
We'll just make it an even 120. All right?

138
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,024
Oh. Thank you.

139
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,024
You have a nice day.

140
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,073

141
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,624
Excuse me. Allowance?
Your family has you on an allowance?

142
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,250
No. No. It's my money.
I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.

143
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,003
- Five hundred dollars a m0nth-
- I don't understand.

144
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,052
You should have social security cheques
plus that pension we talked about.

145
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,756
- So how are you on an allowance?
- Well, the cheques go to Sandpiper.

146
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,140
And then they take out
my fees and my expenses.

147
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,563
Why don't you come on in?
I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.

148
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,019
I have statements here.

149
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,277
Somewhere. Somewhere.

150
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,609
So your pension and social security...

151
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,240
...goes straight
to the Sandpiper people?

152
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:57,289
They take out-
They take out what they need.

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,461
And then I get my allowance.
Here.

154
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,336
And all the rest
goes into my savings account.

155
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,716
It's really all very above-board.
A lot of places do it this way.

156
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,264
This is how they do it
for everybody around here?

157
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,389
Well, yes. They try to make
everything easy for us.

158
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:25,436
Mrs. Landry, are any of your
friends around who I could talk to?

159
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,734
And okay. I said, "What?"</i>

160
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:31,817
<i>So I went in the house,
I told the house...</i>

161
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,119
<i>I could not find...</i>

162
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,321

163
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,128
you have to look on the back.

164
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,046
Okay. And see this key.

165
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,793
See, you have reading glasses.
Could I borrow your glasses?

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,592
- Yes.
- Thank you.

167
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,092
Oh, these are gonna help me.
But I don't know if they'll do the trick.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,053
<i>Heh. So tiny.</i>

169
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,807
Four. Ten. Twelve.

170
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,355
I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell.

171
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,399
It's probably an accident, but we should
look into it, don't you think?

172
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,572
They're not doing this intentionally,
okay? This could be a mistake.

173
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:15,494
If we correct the mistake, then you'll get
some money back. And it'll be fair.

174
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:16,740

175
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,447
Hey, Chuck.

176
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,243
My boxes. The ones I left-

177
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,328
Oh.

178
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,054
Sandpiper Crossing.
Sandpiper Crossing.

179
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,759
- Did you do my wills?
- Yes, I did.

180
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,561
Hey, would you look at that?
Thank you.

181
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,933
This was a one-time thing.

182
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,856
And don't think I don't see
what you were doing here.

183
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,231
You wanted to play Tom Sawyer,
wanted me to paint the fence.

184
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,529
God help me, it worked.

185
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,529
You need help? Hire a paralegal.
Stand on your own two feet.

186
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,157
Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.

187
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,787
- You're not even listening to me.
- No. I hear you, Chuck, okay?

188
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,710
Self- reliance. Great stuff.
Would you look at this?

189
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,253
What did I just say?

190
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:10,581
Take a look, okay? Just right here.

191
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,135
Do you see what I see? All I'm asking
is for you to take a look. Please?

192
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,551
Sandpiper Crossing.

193
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,849
It's a retirement home, assisted living.

194
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,972
This is one of their invoices
they send their residents.

195
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,053
What exactly am I looking for here?

196
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,811
Nothing earthshaking.
Little things. Things like-

197
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,609
Like this right here.

198
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:34,440
Fourteen dollars for
code 118-62. What's 118-62?

199
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,739
I wonder.

200
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,985
How could you even read this?

201
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,491
It's like microfilm.

202
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,168

203
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,547
118-62 is facial tissue.

204
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,258
- Fourteen bucks for a box of Kleenex.
- Yeah. And I found others.

205
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,683
There's three and half dollars for a roll of
toilet paper, 22 bucks for aspirin.

206
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,227
It's a clear pattern of overcharging.

207
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,850
Nothing huge
but adds up to real money.

208
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,148
I mean, here, look.

209
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,899
This woman, she got soaked
for like 400 bucks last month.

210
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,072
And there's a pretty solid attempt
at concealment of that fact.

211
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,615
Which to my way of thinking,
makes it-

212
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,317
Fraud.

213
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,283
This was in work I did?

214
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,786
Yeah.
You must have missed it.

215
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,503
Um... Look, Chuck.
I got lucky, right?

216
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,750
Even a stopped clock
is right twice a day.

217
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,754
This is no mom and pop outfit, okay?
I dug around a little.

218
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:38,380
They're owned by some
real estate investment trust.

219
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,509
I'm working on getting more info
but this could be big.

220
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,967
I mean, this could be
a big case, right?

221
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:49,522
Well, if it's more than a few errant
billings, and if it's systematic...

222
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:55,195
...and you establish a pattern,
it could be class-action.

223
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,647
What do I do now?
I mean, what next?

224
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,903
You need more information.
You don't want to go off half- cocked.

225
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,530
Full cock.

226
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,284
Okay. Now, I'm gonna
head back there. Thank you.

227
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,116
You're the best.

228
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,724
Back to see Mrs. Landry.

229
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,094
Okay.

230
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,601
- What gives?
- Sorry, sir. New policy.

231
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,025
We're concerned about
solicitation on the premises.

232
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,729
I'm not a gigolo
if that's what you're implying.

233
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,860
Legal solicitation.

234
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:43,567
We are obligated to protect
our residents from being harassed.

235
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,903
And we have the right to refuse entry.

236
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,158

237
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,334
I have clients in there now.
They have a legal right to meet with me.

238
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,834
Well, you'll just have to arrange
to meet them elsewhere.

239
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,633
Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?
You making Soylent Green back there?

240
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,136
All right. Okay. I'm backing away.

241
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,808
Yeah?

242
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,807
You know what? Um...

243
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,943
Hey, this has gotten me
a little bit stirred up down there.

244
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,399
Can I use your restroom?
Please. I've got IBS.

245
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,942
Go ahead.

246
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,895
"To Sandpiper Crossing.

248
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,270

250
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,614

251
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,739
Come on now, sir.
I've been very patient.

"Negligent infliction of emotional stress."</i>

253
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,200

and come out.

254
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:17,126
<i>"Contact by the end of the week
or I'll be forced to move forward."</i>

255
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,580
- I need you to finish-
- This is a demand letter...

256
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,883
...informing Sandpiper Crossing
of litigation...

257
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,461
...for defrauding my clients
through overcharging.

258
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,673
You're shredding in there. I'm not deaf.
I can hear you. Stop right now.

259
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,723
This here.
This makes it official, all right?

260
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,054
If you don't stop shredding now,
that's destruction of evidence.

261
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,980
Spoliation, that's what it's called.

262
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,059
And it's a felony. So call your lawyers
right now and tell them I said that. Me.

263
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,520
James McGill, Esquire.

264
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:47,237

267
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,426
- Hey.

268
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,726
- Am I calling at a bad time?
- No. Not at <i>all.</i>

269
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,851
<i>- How you doing?
- Pretty good. Getting by.</i>

270
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,308
<i>- How about you?
- Getting by.</i>

271
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,402
It's good to hear from you.

272
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>Yeah. I've been-- There's been
a lot going on. You know how it is.</i>

273
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,366
Yeah. I know.

274
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:34,948
Uh, listen, I was hoping maybe
you could do me a favour.

275
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,250
Do you think you could watch Kaylee?

276
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,703
<i>It'd be during my shift,
the day after tomorrow.</i>

277
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,663
<i>I hate to ask,
but my regular sitter's down- </i>

278
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,876
Anything you need, I'll be there.

279
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,258
<i>You can get off work?
I don't want to impose or anything.</i>

280
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,181
No. Anytime.

281
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,851
It's not an imposition.

282
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,603
<i>Thanks.</i>

283
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,683
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

284
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,936
Yeah. No problem.

285
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,740
<i>- At quarter to 2?
- I'll see you</i> then.

286
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,942
Okay.

287
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,246

288
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,800
Jesus.

289
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,596

290
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,842

291
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,560

292
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,271

293
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,471
Come on.

294
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,428
Where is it?

295
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,273
Oh. Oh...

296
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,568
Oh. Goddamn it.

297
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,286

298
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,701
It's not like we're close to being done.
Can't you get somebody else to do it?

299
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,334
Right. They don't pay any of us
enough for this shit.

300
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,086
And it's going on and on.
And so I'm like:

301
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,759
"Why are you making
your problems my problems?"

302
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,133
Right. Like you don't have
problems of your own.

303
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,715
Exactly. That's exactly
what I'm saying. Thank you.

304
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:42,092

305
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,472

306

309
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,453
Quite well, thank you.

311
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,750

312
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,875
<i>No. No. No. It's fine.</i>

313
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,751
It's just that you're whispering.

314
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,839
- I'm at the opera.
- Oh. What <i>opera?</i>

315
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,134
<i>- Magic Flute.
- Mozart. Lovely.</i>

316
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,182
Well, I'll try not to keep you.

317
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:27,480
We received something from you today
and we're not quite sure what.

318
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,227
<i>It's</i> a <i>demand letter.</i>

319
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,644
Ah. It was a little confusing
because it was written on-

320
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,695
Well, I had to write it quickly...

321
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:39,570
...because your clients were in the
process of destroying evidence.

322
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,493
Mr. McGill, if you're talking about
shredding documents...

323
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,824
...that's neither irregular nor illegal.
Every business does it.

324
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,625
You say potato, I say spoliation.

325
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,328
Mm- hm. Maybe walk me through
what you're alleging here.

326
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,380
I believe it's all in the letter.

327
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,882
<i>I'm not saying it's not.
But it's a bit hard to read.</i>

328
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,008
Next time, I'd use double ply.

329
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:04,011
Let's not fixate on the medium, okay?
Let's look at the message.

330
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:08,686
Your clients are facing
multiple counts of elder abuse...

331
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,938
...and fraud, and deceptive
and unfair trade practises.

332
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,859
And that's just the start, okay?

333
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,482
I'm not a betting man,
but I'd bet I'll find more.

334
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,862
Mr. McGill,
are you related to Charles McGill?

335
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,864
<i>He's my brother.</i>

336
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,865
Yeah? How's he doing these days?

337
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,537
I fail to see the relevance of this.

338
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,246
The only reason that I made this phone
call was out of respect for Charles...

339
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,376
...on the off chance
you might be related.

340
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,631
My partner suggested to send a
Rule 11 letter and have you sanctioned.

341
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,758
<i>But I didn't want to
jump to that immediately.</i>

342
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,842
How about you stop trying to rattle
my cage and just respond to the merits?

343
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,226
This is my response. You have
no good-faith basis to threaten litigation.

344
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,852
This is a shakedown
and we both know it.

345
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,606
Now, if you push this any further,
my hands will be tied.

346
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,906
I'm sorry for interrupting your evening.
Enjoy the <i>Magic Flute.</i>

347
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,034
Blow my magic flute.

348
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,569

349
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,324

350
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,796

351
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,465

352
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,263

353
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,553

354
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,313

355
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,321
Jimmy, what're you doing here?

356
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:16,284
Oh, Chuck. I'm sorry to...

357
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,791
...show up like this-
I just needed space to work.

358
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:23,124
What is all this?
What have you done to my dining room?

359
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,675
They were spoliating,
the Sandpiper people.

360
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,220
They wouldn't let me in.
I could see they were shredding.

361
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,594
- I wrote them a demand letter, I gave it-
- You broke into a nursing home?

362
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,051
- Assisted living.
- And you stole their garbage.

363
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,886
No, it was in public.
There was no lock, no nothing.

364
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,269
I just lifted the lid
and there it was.

365
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,193
There's no reasonable expectation
of privacy in that situation, is there?

366
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,442
You can't say it's private
if a hobo can use it as a wigwam.

367
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,820
That's the standard, right,
if animals or vagrants can get in?

368
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,031
More or less, yes.

369
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:58,413
Okay, so this is all legal.
It's completely above-the-belt legal.

370
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,461
I just need to figure out
what they're trying to cover up.

371
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,586
You don't shred like this
unless you got something to hide.

372
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,541
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, Chuck.

373
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,720
A lawyer shows up,
starts figuring out their little scheme.

374
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,048
And suddenly this?
No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here.

375
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,393
Well, at least it's not cross- cut.

376
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,846
Look, you won't even
know I'm here, okay?

377
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,977
I just need some space
and some quiet.

378
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,104
And I'll be out of your hair as soon as-

379
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,276
Stop. Stop. It's okay.
You can work here.

380
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,270
Thanks.

381
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,990
I don't mind the company.

382
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,367
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

383
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,950
Good God, yes.

384
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,248
I'll put it on.

385
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,333
Up, up-up-

386
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,375
Shh, shh, shh.

387
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,380

388
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,961
God's sweet sake.

389
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,509

390
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,675
Oh, good. You're up.

391
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:22,769
Well, Jesus, Chuck,
how long have I been asleep?

392
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,314
Chuck,
how did you- ?

393
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,438
I can't believe this.

394
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,655
Uh, thank you. This is a huge help.

395
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,482
I felt like I was
shovelling snow in a blizzard.

396
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,740
Well, it gets better.

397
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,988
What's this?

398
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,868
It's your smoking gun.

399
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,826
It's an invoice for syringes.

400
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,661
Yes. From?

401
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:50,873
Morrissey Medical Supply.
Lincoln, Nebraska.

402
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,424
- So?
- Trust me.

403
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,002
Meanwhile, we need to
start pulling case law.

404
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:01,307
Any precedent dealing
with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68.

405
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:08,270
Probably not a bad idea to pull
30-47-1 from NMSA. Uh, 1978.

406
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:11,192
I don't think that's gonna play,
really.

407
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,361
But it's a good opening salvo for us.

408
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,690
Wait. "Us"?

409
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:21,237
- We're working together on this?
- Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy.

410
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:24,698

411
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,756
All right. All right. All right.
Let's get to work.

412
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,926

413
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,182
- Kim Wexler.

414
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,361
Oh, man.
Sweet talking right out of the gate.

415
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,530
You want something.
Make it fast. I want to go home.

416
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,109
<i>Okay. Okay. Will you look
something up for me on Westlaw?</i>

417
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,661
<i>Please?</i>

418
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,329
You're lucky I'm a pushover.

419
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,452
- All <i>right. Hit me.
- Thank you.</i>

420
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:10,580
Anything on Sedima Vs. lmrex.

421
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,710
Schlesinger Vs. Disney.
Holmes Vs. SIPC.

422
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,915
Whoa, slow down. Slow down.
- Vs. Disney.

423
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,423
- Holmes Vs. SI-
- PC, yeah.

424
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:25,384
Anything on 5712,
one through 24, NMSA, 1978.

425
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,936
<i>Ah, okay. It would help if I knew
what you were looking for, here.</i>

426
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:30,433
Anything. Everything.

427
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,606
You want me to just
read you the headnotes?

428
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,526
<i>No. No. Print it. Full cases.</i>

429
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,697
And any cases that cite to those cases.
Shepardise like the wolf's at the door.

430
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,445
Jesus, Jimmy.
That's gonna be thousands of pages.

431
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,404
<i>Pretty please with sugar on top?
Come on. You owe me one.</i>

432
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,616
Yes, I do. But this is gonna
take hours. And who do I bill it to?

433
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,669
Bill it to Howard.
I still remember his code, 1933.

434
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:54,621
Same year Hitler came to power.

435
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,709
<i>You're not funny.
I'm not billing it to my boss.</i>

436
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,884
How about yours? I'll pay you back.

437
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,679
Jimmy, this is three-
Four hundred bucks worth of printing.

438
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:06,473
The accountants will find it. I'll get fired.
Which sounds fun, but no.

439
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,097
Okay. Hold on a sec.

440
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:15,608
Hey. Kim can't print without a code.

441
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,606
Should I go there,
take notes, come back?

442
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,859
No, no. It'd take too long.
Use mine, 1868.

443
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,361
Yeah.

444
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,873
- 1868, use that. It's Chuck's.
- You're using Chuck's number?

445
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,575
Chuck know you're
using Chuck's number?

446
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,707
We're working on something.
Bring it over to his place after.

447
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,630
- You're a lifesaver.
- Wait. You're working a case together?

448
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,630
<i>Yeah. Keep this under your hat.
But it's gonna be huge.</i>

449
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,882
<i>Maybe a mass-action, even.</i>

450
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,056
We think it will settle
for one, maybe two million.

451
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,351
How does that work?
Chuck's a partner at HHM.

452
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,272
<i>I know Chuck's partnership agreement.
He can work with outside parties.</i>

453
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,817
That clause is intended for
small- time stuff, pro Bono cases.

454
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,739
So I'm Bono. I'm very Bono.
Chuck's a rock star. They'll work it out.

455
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:05,490
And Chuck can handle this?
Last time I saw him, he was-

456
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,568
Last time you saw him,
he wasn't himself, okay?

457
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,153
This is good for him.

458
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,750
<i>- Okay.
- What?</i>

459
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,453
<i>I don't know. I'm just-  Whatever.
I'll see you in a couple hours.</i>

460
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,007
Okay. We're ordering
a pizza. I'll save you a slice.

461
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,358
Hey, you know, if you don't separate
those, you're gonna end up with brown.

462
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,939

463
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,528
- Hey.

464
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,201
We're in here. Oh...

465
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:54,540
We're playing sculptor.
She's Michel-Angelina.

466
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,203
- How's work?
- Oh, you know. Work.

467
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,788
How'd it go?

468
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,921
Kid's a dream.
She's easy.

469
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
And you better stay that way.

470
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,592

471
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,760
How you doing, sweetie, huh?
Huh?

472
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,596
Well. I better be going.

473
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,853
Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?
I wanna talk to you about something.

474
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,101
What's up?

475
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:28,525
I wanna know what
I should do with this.

476
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,661
I've been carrying it around
for weeks.

477
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,284
Like, holding on to it.

478
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,833
Every place I put it feels wrong.

479
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:39,581
I thought about putting it
in the collection plate...

480
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,416
...but that seemed, I don't know..- .

481
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,297
Look, with Matty gone,
I have expenses.

482
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,878
And the death benefit helped, but...

483
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:54,760
What I wanna ask you is...
Can I spend this?

484
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,344
Stace...

485
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,856
...if this money helps you and Kaylee...

486
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,275
...if it does a single good thing
in this world...

487
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:05,193
...then you spend every penny.

488
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,905
It's a relief.

489
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,278
It'll help a lot.

490
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,617

491
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,824
Of course,
it's only a drop in the bucket.

492
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:26,673
I swear, everyone I know
has had problems with them.

493
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,721
I had one. The computer in the engine,
it locked in the middle of the Rockies.

494
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,014
Yeah, it decided I was
overheating and that was it.

495
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,467
Yeah. I couldn't get it fixed
for 100 miles.

496
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:39,019
I had to have it towed to Telluride.
it was unbelievable.

497
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:40,688
No.

498
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,275
No, it's the chip. It's the little...

499
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:49,072
Yeah. It's like 800 bucks,
not counting lab0ur...

500
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,362
Hey, Mel, can I call you back?

501
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,800
Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed.

502
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,014
Gentlemen,
I'm Jimmy McGill. Welcome.

503
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,474
Rich Schweikart.
This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens.

504
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,900
Thanks for coming.
Whoa, I have to ask you.

505
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,068
Please leave electronics in the car.

506
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:30,646
Laptops, BlackBerries,
PalmPilots, watches.

507
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,277
If you lick it
and it goes bzzt, leave it here.

508
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,735
Why?

509
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,411
My brother Chuck
has a certain sensitivity.

510
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,706
It's a medical condition.
This is the price of admission.

511
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,876
Yeah, I heard about this.
Go ahead. It's fine.

512
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,704

513
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,672
There you go.

514
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,389
Make yourselves comfortable,
gentlemen. I'll be right back.

515
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,981
Chuck, come on, buddy.

516
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,612
<i>I'm- </i>

517
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:15,358
- I don't know if I can do this.
- You can do this, all right?

518
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,284
These guys-

519
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:22,992
Those guys, they're nothing, okay?
They're the Pistons and you're the Bulls.

520
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,831
All right? All you gotta do is
sit there and look intimidating.

521
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,291
They're scared of you already.
And they should be.

522
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,753
You're Charles McGill.

523
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,635
Let's go. Let's go get them.

524
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:48,400
Oh. Hey.
Do you remember me, Charles?

525
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,853
We were on a co-defence.
Church's Donuts Vs. Amendola?

526
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,157
It was, Jesus, nine,
ten years ago. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

527
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:58,576
Our guys were suing the other guys.

528
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,657
They were suing us right back. The city
had some grievance with everyone.

529
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,663
So we had to bundle, like,
four actions together.

530
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,744
I was sure that we were sunk.
But you...

531
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,125
You quoted-  What was it?

532
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:13,958
Huh? Addyston Pipe and Steel.

533
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,295
You turned it all antitrust and the whole
thing went away in summary judgment- .

534
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,677
It was amazing. It was amazing.

535
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,431
I figured you'd be arguing in front
of the Supreme Court someday.

536
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:28,226
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Yeah.

537
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,853

538
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,695
All right. Well, let's get started. Um...

539
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:40,402
We've read your revised demand.
It's quite a laundry list. Very creative.

540
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,534
clients have been billing my clients.

541
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,242
Because that's like
Salvador Dali creative.

542
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:49,702
Cute. You know,
you're not gonna make this stick.

543
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,878
- Setting aside evidentiary concerns-
- Whoa.

544
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,085
You guys couldn't afford 10 bucks for a
padlock, that's on them. Public property.

545
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,847
Maybe a judge sees that your way.
Maybe he doesn't.

546
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,798
But the damages for elder abuse...

547
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,181
...the statute requires proof that
there was some undue influence.

548
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,556
Someone threatening the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing.

549
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,061
No one has claimed
there was a guy with a knife...

550
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,065
...telling them to
hand over lunch money.

551
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,864
There are a lot of assisted living facilities
out there that may be disreputable.

552
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:19,862
But that's not the case with our client.

553
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:24,161
All their facilities, all 12 of them,
every single one, five- star rated.

554
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,083
You go to any one of them right now,
you'll see happy, healthy residents.

555
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,494
Sandpiper takes care of these people.
They don't bilk them.

556
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,626
But we looked into it.

557
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:37,550
And some of your clients have,
in fact, been overbilled.

558
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,675
It's an accounting error. It doesn't rise
to the level of fraud, not even close.

559
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,260
We've calculated the damages.
All told, it's $46,320.

560
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,222
Mm- hm. So here's what
we're prepared to do.

561
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,728
We're gonna make your clients whole.

562
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:55,731
A cheque for the 46 and change
right now.

563
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,402
And on top of that...

564
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,903
...we'll give you another
46K to cover your expenses.

565
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:05,077
So what's that, 92?
Let's call it $100,000 even.

566
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:09,498
We admit to no wrongdoing.
And your clients release all claims.

567
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:15,880

568
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,300
to do better than that.

569
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,297
This was in your demand letter.

570
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,552
They're syringes. So?

571
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,101
I don't know if you know this...

572
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,929
...but that's a standard item
in an assisted living facility.

573
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,231
Correct. It's not what it is that matters.
It's where it's from.

574
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,481
Lincoln, Nebraska.

575
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,817
Go, Cornhuskers.

576
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,902
Since you're not picking up
what I'm putting down...

577
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,782
...I'll explain it to you.

578
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,833
Nebraska, although they both
begin with the letter

579
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,753
...actually turns out to be a
different state than New Mexico.

580
00:40:55,954 --> 00:41:01,757
So your client accepted shipments
across state lines for its enterprise.

581
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,009
In the U.S. mail, no less.

582
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,721
Are you trying
to make this a RICO case?

583
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,847
Like our client is John Gotti
or something?

584
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,601
You know as well as I do,
RICO's used mostly for business beefs.

585
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,106
Sedima establishes a pretty low
threshold for RICO provisions to kick in.

586
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,943
Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?

587
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:27,117
Soon as we establish a pattern to-
What was your word? "Overbillings"?

588
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,867
I prefer the classic term of "fraud."

589
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:34,326
You're looking at treble damages
so your 100 grand...

590
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,036
...I think you know where
you can stick it.

591
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,885
Will you give us a moment?

592
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,257

593
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:01,315
Well, what number exactly
did you have in mind?

594
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,947
Twenty million.

595
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,900
- You heard me.

596
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:11,329
- Oh, you can't expect-
- Twenty million dollars.

597
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,623
Or we'll see you in court.

598
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,215

599
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,759
Hmm.

600
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,012

601
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,186
This is a big company.
Twelve separate facilities.

602
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,730
They can't possibly
all be in New Mexico.

603
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:41,650
This is potentially a multi-state
federal class action lawsuit...

604
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,273
...with a RICO kicker
at the penalty phase.

605
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,322
Twenty million, that's conservative.

606
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,650
Class cert, that's where we start.

607
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,657
I'll draft our complaint.
Try to get us a conditional one.

608
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,161
They'll try to pierce it. It should hold
long enough to start discovery.

609
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,117
We need to get you
back on the grounds.

610
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:03,708
Quash this prohibition against you.
Some injunctive relief. Maybe a TRO.

611
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,755
Jimmy, do you want to get
started on the TRO?

612
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,088
Yeah. Yes.

613
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,302

614
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,617

615
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:41,456
He looks good.
No heartworm. No mange.

616
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,585
- Where'd you get her?
- Shelter.

617
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,134
Good. There's too many
puppy mills out there.

618
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,085
I had a dachsie in the other day.

619
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,967
Some douche bred her
so much, poor thing.

620
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:57,347
She just had one giant hernia
for a belly. Couldn't even walk.

621
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,351
Those people can go straight
to hell as far as I'm concerned.

622
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,815
Anything else I can do for you?

623
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,152
You still in touch with your people?

624
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,949
Depends on the type
of work you're looking for.

625
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,371
Your do's, your don'ts
Your wills, your won'ts.

626
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,666
Well, you tell me what you got,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

627
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,757
I signed up three more clients
at the mall today.

628
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,764
Jesus, those mall walkers,
those geezers are faster than you think.

629
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,474
I could sleep for a decade.

630
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,273
Did you get what I asked?

631
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:56,360
- The code provisions.
- Oh...

632
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,195
Shit. Unh...

633
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,699
It's in the car.

634
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,538
Give me a minute. I'll, uh...

635
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,918
I'll go.

636
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:16,925
Where's the- ?

637
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:51,623
Chuck?

638
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,731
Chuck?

639
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,434
Yeah?
