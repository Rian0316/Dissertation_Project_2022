Truth be told, Kim Wexler pushed for this.

34
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,890
你偽造證據
You faked evidence.

35
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,110
我覺得你是在鉆牛角尖
Mmm, I think you're splitting hairs.

你為什么要冒丟工作的風險
Why would you risk the best job you've ever had

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,770
我們想幫助那些
Well, we were looking to help any Sandpiper residents

85
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,500

for, uh, basic goods and services.

這回能想起來了吧
Now, does that ring a bell?

可能吧  是黃色的信封嗎
Maybe. Was it yellow?

88
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,500
是淺黃色的
It's canary yellow.

89
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,310

I picked that color myself.

Well, ma'am, I'm here to make sure you get your money back.

你們在說什么
What are you talking about?

92
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,760

這個問題問得好
Uh, well, now, that's a very good question.

Now, nobody took anybody's money, uh, exactly.

98
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,100
明白嗎
Okay?

99
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,720
不是磯鷂渡的人
It's not like the Sandpiper people, you know,

put on a ski mask and, uh...

101
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,070
持槍打劫了阿爾瑪·梅
mugged Alma May here at gunpoint.

102
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,140
你們別在腦中想象這種場面
So I want you to put that mental image right out of your head.

103
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,780
我們現在說的更像是一種
See, what we're talking about here is more of a --

一點小矛盾
it's just a discrepancy.

It sounds like something got added up wrong.

我已將此作為備忘附在今天的資料里
I've included a memo to that effect in today's materials,

{\an1}{\pos(69,240)}時間軸  喃喃  姜姜  念念

172
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,840
供各位空暇時細讀
which you can peruse at your leisure.

173
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,660
謝謝  艾琳
Thanks, Erin.

174
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,410
我們接著討論客戶聯系事宜吧
How about we move on to client outreach?

16
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,960
{\an4}{\pos(74,230)}后期  四月追番的小新     總監  喃喃

175
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,750
吉米
Jimmy?

176
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,390
你在聽嗎
You still with us?

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,130
我來說吧  免得你自夸
I'm gonna save you from having to brag.

178
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,380
過去三周內有超過兩百位磯鷂渡新委托人簽字
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients signed over the past three weeks.

179
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,450
做得好  吉米
Well-done, Jimmy.

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,620
謝謝你  謝謝  克利福德
Thank you. Thanks, Cliff.

181
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,740
目前
Uh, right now,

182
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,910
我們正在整個西南地區尋找委托人
we're in the process of mapping out the entire southwest,

183
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,170
優先鎖定幾家最大的磯鷂渡機構
targeting the largest Sandpiper facilities first.

184
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,780
鳳凰城  科泉市  沃思堡  普羅沃
Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Fort Worth, Provo --

185
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,320
這還只是第一步
that's just for starters.

186
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,500
我的理想目標是  月底前再簽下兩百人
Ideally, my goal -- another 200 by the end of the month.

187
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,070
有了這么多人  我們有很大機會
With this many folks, we have an excellent shot

188
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,690
在各區的集體訴訟中
at a solid batch of plaintiffs

189
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,790
積累足夠的原告人數
for the classes in each district.

190
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,770
非常好
Excellent.

191
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,070
期待你下一次匯報
Look forward to the next report.

192
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,580
接著是更棘手的議題  協調訴訟
On to a stickier wicket -- coordinating actions.

193
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,640
抱歉
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,990
繼續討論之前
Before we move on,

195
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,680
我想再花點時間談談客戶聯系
I'd like to go back to client outreach just for a moment.

196
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,460
看到這些數據
Looking over these numbers here,

197
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,180
成果真是驚人  吉米
really, astonishing results, Jimmy.

198
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,260
真了不起
Incredible.

199
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,440
你這一趟阿馬里洛之行
Your last trip to Amarillo,

200
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,760
帶回了二十二個新委托人
you came back with 22 new clients.

201
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,530
-是二十四  -二十四
- 24. - 24.

202
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,400
我有點疑惑
I'm confused.

203
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
總共有多少人回復了我們的直達信函
Um, how many people out there actually responded to our direct mailer?

204
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,710
一個
One.

205
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,480
是的  好的
Oh. Right. Yeah.

206
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,390
阿爾瑪·梅·厄爾巴諾太太
A Mrs. Alma May Urbano.

207
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,270
但你從一個回復里又搞定了二十四位新委托人
But you got 24 new clients from this one response?

208
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,830
這真是...
That is -- Wow.

209
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,420
過獎了
Well, you're welcome.

210
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,900
怎么  難道有問題嗎
I mean, what? Is there a problem?

211
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,250
這難免會讓某些人
Well, uh, might not some parties --

212
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,570
比方說  辯護方
the opposing counsel, for example --

213
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,820
發現這差異  因此認為
see this differential and conclude

214
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,070
這其中可能存在教唆之嫌
that there may have been some solicitation involved?

215
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,180
我沒有教唆他們
I did not solicit.

216
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,770
我只想知道你如何解釋你的成功
I'm just wondering how you account for your success.

217
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,680
因為這必定會引起
Because it will definitely raise eyebrows

218
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,380
斯韋卡特和考科利的質疑
over at Schweikart & Cokely.

219
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,190
抱歉但這是事實
I'm sorry, but it will.

220
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,840
特別是牽涉到老年人的案子
Particularly in a case involving seniors,

221
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,940
美國律師協會有關教唆的職業道德規范
for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation

222
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,540
實際上就是為老年人而制定的
were virtually created by the ABA.

223
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,360
查克  我確定...
Chuck, I'm sure that --

224
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,920
吉米  如果你能解釋明白
Jimmy, if you could clear this up,

225
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,910
會大有幫助
that would be helpful.

226
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,540
我去了阿馬里洛探訪一位客戶
I went to Amarillo to confer with a client

227
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,450
確保我們在當地的案子
and to make sure that we had a solid,

228
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,930
建立在真誠可靠的基礎上
good-faith basis for our case there, overall.

229
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,920
如你們所知
And as many of you are aware,

230
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,070
我拜訪了比計劃多得多的養老院
I've visited more than my share of retirement homes.

231
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,670
他們可是關系緊密的社群
These are close-knit communities.

232
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,390
消息傳播得總是特別快
Let me tell you, word gets around real fast.

233
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,860
住二期的桃樂茜買了輛新的電動車
If Dorothy in Phase Two gets a new Rascal Scooter,

234
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,490
馬上大家就知道了
well, it's big news.

235
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,020
所以其他二十三位老年人主動找到你
So these other 23 residents, they approached you.

236
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,620
克利福德  在我踏進德州前
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt

237
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,610
他們早已聽到了風聲
before I crossed state lines.

238
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,540
我更沒有必要挨家挨戶拜訪
And I certainly didn't have to go knocking on any doors.

239
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,120
他們都很想和一位帶來好消息
And is it any surprise that they want to speak

240
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,990
說他們有錢拿的人談話
with the guy who was there to show them

241
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,000
這有什么好驚訝的嗎
they may have money coming their way?

242
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,980
我得說  這么一想
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind,

243
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,980
我還可以做得更好
I should've done better.

244
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,790
有道理  霍華德
Makes sense. Howard?

245
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,310
查克
Chuck?

246
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,010
我們能繼續了嗎
We good to move on?

247
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,550
查克這也不是順帶一提
And, Chuck, not incidentally,

248
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,590
這至關重要
it is absolutely vital

249
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,100
我們必須十分謹慎
that we dot our I's and cross our T's here.

26
00:09:37,010 --> 00:10:17,130


250
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,260
謝謝你寶貴的意見
Invaluable. So, thank you.

251
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,270
完美的代價乃永恒的警惕
The price of excellence is eternal vigilance.

252
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,180
沒錯
Indeed.

253
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,640
協調
Coordination.

254
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,330
我們剛剛是談到這里吧
I believe that's where we left off.

255
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:50,940
沒錯
That's right.

256
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,510
布萊恩  你負責這個  你來說吧
Brian, this is your thing, so why don't you take this?

257
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,760
好吧
Sure.

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,870
考慮到這些案子所涉及的方面
Considering the dimensions of these cases,

259
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,490
進行具體分析和綜合考量后
taken together and individually,

260
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,340
應該指定專人進行規劃安排
it makes sense to designate someone to handle the scheduling.

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,740
我建議在戴維斯梅因成立一個小組
What I'm proposing is that we create a small team at D&M

262
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,380
專門負責協調單個訴訟及其之間的
dedicated specifically to coordinating all elements

263
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,760
所有因素
of the individual actions.

264
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,230
我們凡事都會告知哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
We'll loop in HHM on anything --

265
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,710
布萊恩  抱歉
Uh, Brian, I'm sorry.

266
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,860
抱歉打斷你一下
Excuse me for interrupting.

267
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,430
我只是想說我同意查克的觀點
Uh, I just want to say that I take Chuck's point.

268
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,380
真的
I do.

270
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,520
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}意即不能接受別人的懷疑

269
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,520
就像凱撒之妻一樣
I mean, this is, like, a wife-of-Caesar type of thing.

271
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,620
連教唆的意思都不能有
There can't even be a hint of solicitation.

272
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,460
所以我準備不這么辦了
So I'm gonna pull back.

273
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,390
好吧  不到磯鷂渡搞什么見面會了
All right, no more meet-and-greets at the Sandpiper facilities.

274
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,680
我會另想辦法的
I'll find another way to proceed.

275
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,130
吉米  這我們就交給你了
Well, Jimmy, we'll leave that up to you.

276
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,820
聯系客戶是你負責的事
You know, client outreach is your department.

277
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,140
說到哪兒了來著
Uh, where was I?

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,530
對
Okay, right.

279
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,480
如果我們能在新墨西哥有更穩固的指揮中心
If we have a more consolidated nerve center here in New Mexico,

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,410
就能...
where the...

281
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,810
金  我該上哪兒搞尼德曼的供詞
Hey, Kim, uh, where can I get a copy of that Neiderman deposition?

282
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,770
我有一份多的  吉米
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.

283
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,160
給你一份吧
You can have one of mine.

284
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,070
謝了  艾琳
Oh, wow. Thanks, Erin.

285
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
不客氣
Yeah, no worries.

286
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,850
該死  我放哪兒了
Shoot. Where'd I put that?

287
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,970
謝了...
Thanks, that's...

288
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,060
查克真是令人難以置信
Man, do you believe Chuck in there?

289
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,140
天啊  還教唆
Jesus. Solicitation?

290
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,930
我告訴你  我們當初拼命立案的時候
Let me tell you, when we were building this case,

291
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,560
我可是追在逛商場的八十歲老頭后面
I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.

292
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,490
這才叫教唆
That was solicitation.

293
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,980
但他有說我什么嗎
But did he say "Boo"?

294
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,280
當然沒有
Bullshit he did.

295
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,990
在德州發生了什么
What happened in Texas?

296
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,070
沒什么
Nothing.

297
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,980
我做了我該做的
I did my job.

298
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,520
你沒有在休息室里給那些老家伙載歌載舞嗎
You didn't do a song and dance in the dayroom for the old-timers?

299
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,720
沒有  沒有
No. No.

300
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,770
沒...沒在休息室里
Not -- not in the dayroom.

301
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,240
吉米  你知道教唆他人會讓你被取消律師資格的
Jimmy, you know solicitation can get you disbarred.

302
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,680
這很重要
This matters.

303
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,330
我認為最重要的是
Well, here's what I think matters --

304
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,160
現在二十四名老年人有自己的代表了
24 senior citizens now have representation.

305
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,900
我去之前
Before I went,

306
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,810
他們根本不知道自己被剝削了
they didn't even know they were getting ripped off.

307
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,370
現在他們有我們撐腰
Now they have us in their corner.

308
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,940
這怎么能不算一種勝利呢
How is that not a win?

309
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,010
你剛剛說你會另想辦法
You said in there you'd find another way.

310
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,810
你是認真的嗎
Did you mean it?

311
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,610
當然了  絕對的  我...
Sure. Absolutely. I --

312
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,040
聽著  我...
Look, I...

313
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,570
我要告訴你一件非常重要的事
I need you to understand something very critical here.

314
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,120
說吧
Shoot.

315
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,990
為了給你弄到這份工作  我拿我的飯碗作擔保
I put myself on the line to get you this job.

316
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,420
好吧
Uh, okay.

317
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,520
我還以為是因為我擅長與老人打交道呢
I thought it was 'cause I'm sensational with old people.

318
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,560
那你以為是誰告訴他們的
Yeah, and who do you think told them that?

319
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,900
所以呢...這算是你幫了我嗎
So, what -- you threw me a bone?

320
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,230
不...混蛋
No...asshole.

321
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,730
你知道我相信你
You know I believe in you.

322
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,750
后來我也說服他們相信你
But then I made my beliefs known to them.

323
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,510
現在你做的一切在霍華德看來就代表著我
And now everything you do reflects back on me with Howard,

324
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,900
因為說到底  是我說服他
'cause ultimately, I talked him into

325
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
冒險讓你試一試
going out on a limb for you, too.

326
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,110
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

327
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,950
是...是我的承諾  是我的判斷
It's -- it's -- it's my word, it's my judgment.

328
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,020
明白
Yeah.

329
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,780
你我都知道你能勝任這份工作
You and I both know you can do this job.

330
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,440
但拜托你用正確的方式
But please, you just have to do it right.

331
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,390
你得確保
Well... you want to make sure

332
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,020
電池的方向正確  不然沒有用
you put in the batteries the right way or he won't work.

333
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,100
然后合上蓋子
Then you close them up.

334
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,770
然后...
And...

335
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,510
我覺得...我覺得這樣就行了  小姑娘
I think -- I think you're good to go, young lady.

336
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,180
你捏一下它的腳試試
Why don't you give his foot a squeeze?

337
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,610
它真好笑
He's funny!

338
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,740
親愛的
Oh, darlin'.

339
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,700
我就叫你...哼哼先生吧
I think I'll name you... Mr. Snuggles.

340
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,010
你餓了嗎
Are you hungry?

341
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,210
我去給你拿點土豆泥
I'm gonna get you some mashed potatoes.

342
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,120
這些錢應該夠你撐過下個月了
That should get you through to next month.

343
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,840
麥克  謝謝
Mike, thank you.

344
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,240
但你其實沒必要...
But you shouldn't feel that you need to --

345
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,290
太遲了
Too late.

346
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,680
出什么事了
Something up?

347
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,380
感覺好像有什么事
Feels like something's up.

348
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,610
不  只是...
No, it's...

349
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,580
我睡得不夠
I didn't get much sleep.

350
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,760
-我的頭...  -抱歉
- My head's... - I'm sorry.

351
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,610
跟我說這不關我的事  那我就不管了
You tell me it's none of my business, I'll drop it.

352
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,980
我不想讓你擔心
I don't want you to worry.

353
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,620
我也不喜歡擔心
Not the worrying kind.

354
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,410
前兩晚  我聽到了槍聲
Last two nights, I heard gunshots.

355
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,410
第一晚  可能在一兩個街區外
First night, they were maybe a block or two over

356
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,570
我驚醒了
and woke me up.

357
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,470
我第一反應是鞭炮聲
My first thought was firecrackers,

358
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,010
我當時這么認為的
and that's what I assumed at the time,

359
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,880
但是昨晚  我絕對沒聽錯
but then last night -- there's no mistaking it.

360
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,710
一共三聲
There was three of them.

361
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,980
很快  "啪啪啪"三聲  更近了
They were quick -- pop, pop, pop -- closer.

362
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,970
好像...
It was...

363
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,100
他們就在房子外面
like they were right outside the house.

364
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,870
你報警了嗎
You call the cops?

365
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,770
報了
Yeah.

366
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,460
警察一小時后才過來
Took them over an hour to get here,

367
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,400
在周圍看了整整兩分鐘
then they looked around for a whole two minutes,

368
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,890
當然沒什么發現
but by then, of course, there was nothing to see.

369
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,080
我今晚待這兒
I'm staying here tonight.

370
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,290
不用  麥克
No, Mike, no.

371
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,460
-沒這個必要  -我沒問題
- That's not necessary. - No, it is not a problem.

372
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,670
我睡沙發
I'll take the couch.

373
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,040
麥克  你問了我才回答
Mike, you asked, so...I answered.

374
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,260
別讓我后悔告訴你
Please don't make me sorry I told you.

375
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,500
凱莉  過來
Kaylee, come, hmm?

376
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,250
吃晚飯
Get your supper.

377
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,950
那科泉市呢
What about Colorado Springs?

378
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,740
283個居住者  發了283封信函
283 residents, and we sent out 283 mailers.

379
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,210
行  那有多少回函呢
Yeah, and how many response cards came back?

380
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,970
零
Zero.

381
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,420
零嗎
Zero?

382
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,780
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

383
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,460
達納  托尼  再見
Dana, Toni, have a good one.

384
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,900
再見  梅因先生
Bye, Mr. Main.

385
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,190
再見  梅因先生
You, too, Mr. Main.

386
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,930
克利福德  能談會兒嗎
Cliff, uh, could I have a second?

387
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,230
怎么了
What's up?

388
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,130
是寄給磯鷂渡信函的事
Uh, yeah, it's the Sandpiper mailers.

389
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,010
我們應該有約百分之十二到十五的回信
Yeah, we should be getting responses of like 12 to 15 percent,

390
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,500
但只有一兩個點
but we're getting ones and twos.

391
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,330
科泉市甚至為零
In Colorado Springs, zero.

392
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,020
怎么會這樣
Wow. How can that be?

393
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,110
他們員工搞的鬼吧
I'm thinking it's the staff.

394
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,400
信封交給居住者前就被員工扔了吧
They're tossing the mailers before they can reach the residents.

395
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,780
可能是他們上級要他們這么做的
Maybe they got told to do it by the Sandpiper front office,

396
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,750
真可以以這個起訴他們
which would be actionable as hell.

397
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,350
前提是我們能證明  但很難做到
If we could prove it. Big "if."

398
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,840
我需要更多人力才做得到
And to do so would take more manpower than I can spare.

399
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
我們現在先繼續爭取更多委托人
For now, let's just stick with getting those client numbers up.

400
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,070
你最好另尋他法
Guess you better think of another way.

401
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,410
已經想好了
I think I got it.

402
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,700
電視廣告  更具針對性
TV commercial. Highly targeted.

403
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,780
告訴你  在磯鷂渡里一切都很準時
Let me tell you, at Sandpiper, the trains run on time.

405
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,690
{\an3}{\pos(374,227)}將意大利塑造成整齊劃一和嚴密控制社會的法西斯領袖

404
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,690
墨索里尼會很驕傲
Mussolini would be proud.

406
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,160
我至今拜訪的每個人日程都完全相同
Every one I visited so far, same exact schedule.

407
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,940
上午十點  水中有氧操
10:00 A.M., water aerobics.

408
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
下午兩點  隊列舞
2:00 P.M., line dancing.

409
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,950
諸如此類
So on and so forth.

410
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,890
下午三點到四點都是自由活動
They always leave 3:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M. free.

411
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,370
為什么  因為要看《女作家與謀殺案》[美劇]
Why? "Murder, She Wrote."

412
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,320
這劇長盛不衰
It's been in syndication since like the 1850s,

413
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,500
跟你說  只要電視里一開始演
and let me tell you, when that thing comes on,

414
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,120
那些老年人就像飛蛾撲捕蟲燈一樣
it draws the blue-hairs like moths to a bug zapper.

415
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,600
下午三點十四  第一段以懸念結束后
3:14 P.M., end of the first-act cliffhanger,

416
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,480
進第一個廣告  戴維斯梅因律所
first commercial up, Davis & Main.

417
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,600
保證賺足眼球
Guaranteed eyeballs -- lots of 'em.

418
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,900
磯鷂渡對此無能為力
There's nothing Sandpiper can do about that.

419
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,040
我們幾年前做過一個廣告
We ran a commercial a few years back --

420
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,790
也是起集體訴訟案
another class-action case.

421
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,720
對我們算是新鮮事
Kind of a new thing for us.

422
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,330
我不習慣這么做
Now, it's not exactly my go-to,

423
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,450
但我持開放態度
but generally speaking, I'm open to it.

424
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,260
我們下周再談
We will talk next week.

425
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
真棒
Great.

426
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,620
一路平安
Safe travels.

432
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,980

波紋效果
Oh, the -- the swirl.

441
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,070
他們想做得朦朧些  但又不要太朦朧
They wanted it kind of nebulous, but not too nebulous.

442
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,910
還有速度的問題
Then there was the issue of the speed.

443
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,110
我記得他們為此開了很多會
I remember there were a lot of meetings about that.

因為會在整個西南部播出
'cause it's gonna play all around the Southwest,

471
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,650
誰知道這會帶來什么呢
so who knows what it could lead to?

472
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,380
最好能給我們每人帶來一百塊
It better lead to a hundred bucks each.

473
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,020
你要錢做什么
What is it with you and money?

問你們個問題

{\an3}{\pos(374,227)}三人均為著名導演

478
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,900
這樣的偉大人物有什么共同點

什么
What?

480
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,640
他們三人  無一例外

484
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,250
這讓人興奮  對吧
This is heady stuff, right?

485
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,730
那么  聽好了
Okay. So, pay attention.

486
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,430
畫面從老奶奶開始  她坐在搖椅上搖
We open on granny, and she is rocking.

487
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,620
就這樣來回地搖
So she's back and forth,

488
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,150
慢慢地搖啊搖
just very back...and forth.

489
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,690
然后  非常緩慢且平穩地
And then, very slowly and smoothly,

490
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,280
攝影機移向她的...
the camera, uh... moves towards her...

491
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,980
-移動攝影車嗎  -移動攝影車  沒錯
- Dolly? - A dolly -- good.

492
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,190
你看這有移動攝影車嗎
See a dolly here?

493
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,890
你們沒帶移動攝影車來
You guys didn't bring a dolly?

494
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,150
沒有
Nope, no dolly.

495
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,190
你沒說要帶移動攝影車來
You didn't ask for a dolly.

496
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,490
-得提前說  攝影車要額外收費  -是的
- Gotta ask, dude. Dolly's extra. - It's true.

497
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,380
好吧  那就沒有吧
Okay, no dolly.

498
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,800
那我們就即興發揮一下
We will improvise, then.

499
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,190
順著我的思路
Stay with me.

500
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,450
她搖晃著
She's rocking.

501
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,010
打著寒戰
She's shivering.

502
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,010
緊緊抓著一個破舊的披肩
She's clutching at a tattered shawl.

503
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,980
那些混蛋把她的暖氣停掉了
They turned the heat off on her, these evil bastards.

504
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,420
她又冷又餓  孤單一人
She's cold and hungry, she's friendless.

505
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,810
真是一幅令人心痛的畫面
This is heart-rending stuff, man.

506
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,490
一個長鏡頭  背景用黑白色調
Okay, it's a oner, and it's shot in glorious black and white.

507
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,050
這個可以做到吧
We can do that, right?

508
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,130
可以
Yeah.

509
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,880
就這樣而已嗎
So that's it?

510
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,650
老太太坐在椅子上
Old lady in a chair?

511
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,870
這就是你的廣告
That's your commercial?

512
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,800
你這副樣子有人喜歡嗎
Does anybody like you?

513
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,160
我準備好拍特寫了  麥吉爾先生
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. McGill.

514
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,920
一記高飛球  稍偏離正中
...And an easy, easy pop fly off dead center.

515
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,440
墨菲在之前的八場比賽中29擊13中

安打率為0.343  非常棒
batting a blistering 343 overall,

517
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,890
劉易斯現在又在跟教練商量

墨菲投球  球觸地兩次進入人群
Murphy swings, it's a two-hopper into the crowd.

519
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,760

Foul ball.

520
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,960
祝你今天愉快
Have a good one.

521
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,300
出什么事了
Hey, honey. What's happening?

522
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,300
怎么了
What's wrong?

523

發生什么了
What happened?

你還好吧
Are you all right?

527
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,030
我帶你去看看
Let me show you.

528
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,280
那上面
It's up -- it's up there.

529

你看到了嗎
You see it?

530
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,280
就在那上面
It's right up there.

531
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,970
看到了嗎  你看到它的形狀了嗎
You see that? You see the shape of it?

532
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,200
你看到了吧
You do see it, right?

533
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,500
看到了
I-I see it.

534
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,410
你什么時候聽到的槍聲

538

你也沒有報警  報了嗎
And you didn't call the police. Or did you?

539
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,850
沒有  報警有什么用
No, I... What's the point?

540
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
我在想有沒有其他的可能...
I'm thinking outside the box, but...

541
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,220
有沒有可能是你做夢夢到的
you think maybe it's possible that you dreamed it?

542
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,590
有時會發生這種情況
It happens sometimes.

543
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,750
我沒有做夢  麥克
I didn't dream it, Mike.

544

因為我昨晚一夜沒合眼
Because I didn't sleep a wink last night.

545

這就是子彈的痕跡  肯定是

昨晚之前還沒有
It wasn't there before last night.

547

我跟你保證  我不知道...
I promise you that, and I don't know --

548

你對這些東西不好奇嗎
You ever wonder about these things?

558

什么東西
What things?

559

這個  為什么會有這些東西
This. Like, what's the story with these?

560
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,970
是誰第一個說
Who was it who first said,

561
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,090
"我知道了  就放一大碗球吧"
"Hey, I know -- big bowl of balls."

562
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,410
我不知道
I don't know.

563
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,000
房子自帶的
They came with the place.

564
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,180
要你說
No shit.

565

世界上每間公司臨租房里都有這東西
They're in every corporate apartment in the world.

566
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,000
就像基甸國際贈送的《圣經》

567
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,320
好啦  不要嫉妒我的一大碗球了
Hey, don't be jealous of my big bowl of balls.

568
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,550
別丟人了
It's unbecoming.

569
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,930
為什么一定要擺空花瓶呢
Why do they all have to have empty vases?

570
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,930
法律規定的  這是比喻的說法
Well, it's the law. Plus, it's a metaphor.

571
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,600
我必須得說
I got to say,

572
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,880
我會想念美甲店的振動按摩椅的

不會吧
No!

586
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,930
沒錯  警長無能為力
Yes. The sheriff is in over his head,

587
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,660
杰西卡·弗萊徹不得不再次
and once again, Jessica Fletcher has to put aside the novel

588
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,200
把她在寫的小說放一邊來協助執法

他們說會照顧好一切

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,500
她裝哭的是吧

719
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,560
什么活
What's the job?

720
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,470
我問了  那人不肯說

Shut up. Watch the movie.

735
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,960
你怎么會有這么奇怪的愛好
What is this weird fascination you have

736
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,820
喜歡看人被困在北極
with stories of men trapped on the North Pole?

737
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,910
《大北極》的設定在北極
"Ice Station Zebra" is on the North Pole.

738
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,250
《怪形》發生在南極
"The Thing" takes place on the South Pole.

739
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,270
這兩個天差地別
They literally could not be any more different.

I know, right?

743
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,400
都對這片子贊不絕口
Can't get two finer reviews than that.

744
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,820
空氣瓶組內還剩多少壓力
How much pressure's left in the air banks?

745
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,490
不足八百磅  長官
Down 800 pounds, sir.

746
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,770
是老板
It's the boss.

747
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,860
這時候打電話來
At this hour?

748
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,050

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,850
祝賀嘛  多晚都不嫌遲
It's never too late for congratulations.

750
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,610

Cliff, Jesus, you're still at the office?

751
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,200
你播了一支廣告
You ran a commercial?

752
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,080
是啊  天哪
Yeah, and, oh, my God,

753
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,000
我跟你說  那反響簡直
let me tell you, the response has been --

754
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,410
你拍了一個廣告  沒給我過目就播出去了
You ran a commercial without ever showing it to me,

755
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,190
也沒有事先征求我和合伙人的意見
without first consulting me and my partners.

756
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,410
你真以為我會同意嗎
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?!

757
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,190
我打算明天早上告訴你的
I was planning on telling you in the morning.

758
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,280
廣告播出一天之后才告訴我
The day after it aired?!

759
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,770
只播出了一次  只面向很小一部分觀眾
I only ran it once, just in one small market.

760
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,630
只是個試驗而已  好吧
It was kind of an experiment, all right?

761
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,830
沒什么人注意
Kind of under the radar.

762
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,610
而且公平地講
And in all fairness,

763
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,370
你說過的  客戶聯系這塊歸我管
you did tell me client outreach was my department.

764
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,640
不要狡辯了

767
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,740
天哪

霍華德說你有些古怪
Howard said you were a little eccentric.

他可沒說你這么能惹事兒
He didn't tell me you were a goddamn arsonist!

770
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,220
克利福德  說真的  我不認為
Cliff, to be fair, I don't think, uh...

771

區區七百塊廣告費就有這么好的效果
off a measly $700 ad buy.

776
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,780
這種投資回報率可不是你...
Now that kind of return on investment you can't g--

我錯過什么了
So, what'd I miss?
