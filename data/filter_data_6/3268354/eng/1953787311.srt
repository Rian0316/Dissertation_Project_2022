00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:03,875
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, as you know,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall had decided</i>

2
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:06,360
<i>to move to Rome after</i>
<i>Barney and Robin's wedding.</i>

3
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:07,545
We're going to Italy.

4
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,029
<i>Si.</i>

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,381
<i>But without telling Lily,</i>

6
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:12,866
<i>Marshall had then accepted</i>
<i>a judgeship in New York.</i>

7
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:15,319
Good luck with that...
Your Honor.

8
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,721
<i>Until his always-helpful</i>
<i>road trip companion</i>

9
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:20,591
<i>Daphne had selflessly</i> (phone ringing)
<i>come to his aid.</i>

10
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,676
You texted Lily
that I took the job?

11
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:23,877
You're welcome.

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,929
You were torturing yourself

13
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:26,230
figuring out how to tell her,

14
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,648
I just broke the ice for you.

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,316
I was standing on that ice.

16
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:31,068
Now I'm gonna be bobbing,

17
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,404
facedown on a frigid creek.

18
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:36,157
I do not need to know the nasty
way you apologize to your wife.

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,944
And frigid? Maybe you're
just doing it wrong.

20
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:43,664
Hi, baby.

21
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,583
I can't believe you did this
behind my back.

22
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,501
I know, I should
have talked to you.

23
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:48,953
Thanks to you, we are stuck

24
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:52,173
all weekend in the room
with a ghost in it.

25
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:54,258
Room with a...?

26
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,510
We got 13?

27
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:59,079
The room that's haunted by
the ghost of Captain Dearduff?

28
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,201
Who got the who
with the what now?

Original Air Date on October 28, 2013

00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:10,227

31
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:15,996
NARRATOR: <i>Marshall had</i>
<i>recently discovered</i>

32
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:17,931
<i>that the Farhampton Inn</i>
<i>was featured</i>

33
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,701
<i>in an episode of The Ghost</i>
<i>Network's original series,</i>

34
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,487
True & Real Ghost Stories
of the Supernatural.

35
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,039
Ooh, there, see?

36
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,407
The Farhampton Inn.

37
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,774
I told you it sounded familiar.

38
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,610
TV NARRATOR:
<i>In 1843,</i>

39
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:32,546
<i>the streets of Farhampton,</i>
<i>Long Island</i>

40
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,281
<i>were stalked</i>
<i>by a vicious killer</i>

41
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:37,084
<i>named Captain Blazeby Dearduff.</i>

42
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:40,638
<i>Dubbed "Dearduff the Hooker,"</i>
<i>he murdered dozens</i>

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,807
<i>of unwary travelers</i>
<i>with his sharpened hook.</i>

44
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:46,143
<i>Ironically that hook</i>

45
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:48,062
<i>would prove Dearduff's</i>
<i>own undoing</i>

46
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:50,964
(laughing maniacally)
<i>one wintry night in room 13</i>

47
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,434
<i>of the Farhampton Inn.</i>

48
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:55,686
(fly buzzing)
(grunting)

49
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:59,273
(yells)

50
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,408
Uh-oh.

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,111
<i>He was found the next morning,</i>
<i>frozen to death.</i>

52
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,497
MAN: Boom!

53
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,367
<i>Some say you can still hear</i>
<i>Captain Dearduff's cries coming</i>

54
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:11,818
<i>from room 13.</i>

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,003
Cold.

56
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,756
So cold.

57
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:19,460
Help me... help me...

58
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:23,247
MAN:
We can see you, Ron.

59
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:25,999
<i>Some say you can still hear</i>
<i>the thump of his peg</i>

60
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,835
<i>and the scrape of his hook.</i>

61
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,638
<i>Others say</i>
<i>Dearduff the Hooker was just</i>

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,507
<i>a popular male prostitute</i>
<i>who murdered no one</i>

63
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:37,011
<i>and died of syphilis in 1848.</i>

64
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:38,479
<i>Let's hear</i>
<i>from some people who have</i>

65
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,948
<i>actually survived</i>
<i>a night in room 13.</i>

66
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,116
(thunder crashing)

67
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,684
Did I see a ghost?

68
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,402
Of course...
WOMAN: <i>Yes.</i>

69
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,520
There's...
<i>Are.</i>

70
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,289
...such thing as ghosts.

71
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,491
(Dearduff laughing maniacally)

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,745
So, have you seen the ghost?

73
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:56,997
Not yet, but that might just be

74
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,917
because ghosts
don't exist, Marshall!

75
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,752
So explain the night shirt

76
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:04,672
we saw flying around our cabin
in the Poconos.

77
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,974
An owl got stuck in it.

78
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:09,710
We saw it fly out the neck hole.

79
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:12,212
Yeah, the ghost of an owl
that died in that cabin.

80
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:15,882
Plus it's a crappy room,
but when I tried to complain...

81
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:18,652
The thermostat in
my room is broken.

82
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:20,254
The AC won't turn off.

83
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,523
Ooh!

84
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,608
Sounds like the work
of Captain Dearduff.

85
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,411
He brings with him
the icy chill of death.

86
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:31,165
So... bad luck there.

87
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,233
Night-night.

88
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,919
It sounds like you're
using Captain Dearduff

89
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,672
as an excuse for a crappy room.

90
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:39,757
I beg your pardon.

91
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,959
I did not get to be
a 40-year-old night clerk

92
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,711
by making excuses.

93
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,346
Now, if there is anything
wrong with your room

94
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,463
that isn't ghost-related,

95
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,048
I'm more than happy
to address it.

96
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,301
Okay, the Wi-Fi doesn't work.

97
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:52,886
Ghosts interfere
with electronic devices.

98
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,054
The shower's leaking.

99
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,639
Dearduff likes
the sound of dripping.

100
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,475
Reminds him
of his bleeding victims.

101
00:03:58,477 --> 00:03:59,977
And the door won't lock.

102
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,612
Captain Dearduff
doesn't want to...

103
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,280
you know,
be locked out of his room.

104
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:05,149
Why would a locked door
keep a ghost out?

105
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,601
Can't he just walk
through walls?

106
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:08,952
Maybe he's afraid of rats.

107
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,071
There are rats in the walls?

108
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:15,492
No.

109
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:17,661
And the inn's booked up
because of the wedding,

110
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,380
so we can't change rooms.

111
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:22,616
Oh, that sucks.

112
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,251
I'm sorry, baby.

113
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:25,419
Hey...

114
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,637
but if Dearduff does manifest,

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,055
you know the proper way
to harvest ectoplasm, right?

116
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,257
(phone beeps)

117
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,142
Hey, good news-- we're all set
for the dove release.

118
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:33,960
The what?
When we leave the church,

119
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,629
they're gonna release
a hundred doves.

120
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:38,065
It's gonna be
avi-wait-for-it-ary.

121
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,349
Aviary!

122
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,467
Oh.

123
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,486
That might be a problem.
Why?

124
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,937
Because when
we leave the church,

125
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,139
a few of the gun enthusiasts
in my family

126
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,442
are gonna fire a 21-gun salute.

127
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:50,778
(bells tolling, doves cooing)
Hey, man.

128
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,979
(gunfire)

129
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:59,086
(dove cooing)
Oh, look-- one got away.

130
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,821
(gunshot)

131
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,656
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

132
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:04,875
At a wedding?
(laughing)

133
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,127
Yeah, that's romantic.

134
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,514
(thunder rumbling)

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,269
(thunder crashing)

136
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,193
(thunder crashes)

137
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,647
(screams)

138
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,233
(grunts, groans)

139
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,018
Ted!

140
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,321
What the hell are
you doing in my room?!

141
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:35,372
Uh...

142
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,957
NARRATOR:
<i>There was an explanation.</i>

143
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,877
<i>You see, after Marshall</i>
<i>got off the phone with Lily,</i>

144
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,411
<i>he'd called me.</i>

145
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,080
(phone rings)

146
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,498
Hey, buddy. What's up?

147
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,750
Ted, listen, I need you
to sneak into Lily's room,

148
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,169
find her phone, and delete
the last text she got.

149
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:49,887
Why? What's...

150
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,638
Ted, I need you to do this

151
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,890
no questions asked.

152
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,727
And as we both know, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

153
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:59,179
(phone rings)
Hey.

154
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,515
TED: Hey. Listen, I need you
to do something for me

155
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,684
no questions asked, okay?
What is it?

156
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:06,052
Meet me at the corner
of 53rd and 8th.

157
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,856
Bring your drill.
(click)

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,444
TED:
Marshall.

159
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,614
What the hell?

160
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,166
How did you...

161
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,601
No...

162
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:23,137
questions... asked.

163
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,672
I broke federal law drilling you
out of that mailbox.

164
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,508
Hey, I was a man in need.

165
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,344
I know.
You were a "Priority Male."

166
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,345
You said you'd

167
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,380
stop doing that joke
after the editor

168
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,516
of Bazooka Joe comics
rejected it.

169
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,134
That man is a comedy snob.

170
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,468
The point is,

171
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,970
you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

172
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,889
Okay, okay!
I'll delete the text.

173
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,106
Thank you.

174
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:44,608
I just have to figure out

175
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,143
how to get into Lily's room.

176
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:48,645
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted, so...

177
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,096
The drainpipe!
What?

178
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,982
There's a drainpipe that
runs up near her window,

179
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,034
and, no big deal,
I can totally climb it.

180
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,202
I'll call you when it's done.

181
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:56,320
Her door is unlock...

182
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,071
(click)

183
00:06:58,073 --> 00:06:59,406
Uh...

184
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,625
Marshall wanted me
to check on you.

185
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,627
He was worried
that you might be scared

186
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,379
all alone in the ghost room.

187
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,130
Remind me to call
you next time

188
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:09,416
Marvin has a nightmare--
you can calm him

189
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,303
by bursting into his room with
a chain saw and a hockey mask!

190
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,589
Sorry, I didn't want to knock
in case you were already asleep,

191
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,791
so I just climbed the drainpipe
up to your window.

192
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,560
No big deal.
Mm, opened the latch

193
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,595
with this here coat hanger.

194
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,847
I would have called,
but, uh...

195
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,850
well, I didn't know if
you'd have your phone handy.

196
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,986
Say, where is
that old phone of yours?

197
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,604
Ted, I am
not scared,

198
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,806
so why don't you head back
to your room...

199
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:33,941
(thunder crashes)
(screams): Oh...

200
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:35,692
kay...

201
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,862
Why, I guess you can stay
until I fall asleep,

202
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,914
if it'll make <i>you</i> feel better?

203
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,250
(thunder crashes)
A-And...

204
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,285
maybe if it'll
make you feel even better,

205
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:48,589
you can sing me a version
of Marvin's lullaby?

206
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,040
Okay.

207
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,042
Okay.

208
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:55,012
♪ Night-night, little Lily

209
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:58,215
♪ No ifs, ands or buts

210
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:02,519
♪ No peg-legged ghost

211
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,355
♪ To hook out your guts.

212
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:06,890
Ted!

213
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,108
Sorry. Sorry.

214
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,977
Nighty-night.

215
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,563
(Ted humming lullaby)

216
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,868
(continues humming lullaby)

217
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,487
(continues humming)

218
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:23,573
ETHEREAL VOICE (softly):
Cold...

219
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:26,076
So cold.

220
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,630
Help me.

221
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,383
Help me...

222
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh, God, the Hooker's here!
Ted,

223
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:39,039
I am not gonna cheat on Robin.

224
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,125
But you're a hell of a best man
for getting me one, buddy.

225
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:43,543
Where is she?

226
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:44,895
All right,
I'll take a lap dance.

227
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:47,097
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

228
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,149
(whispers): Barney, what
are you doing in there?

229
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,250
Marshall asked me

230
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,702
to do something for him,
no questions asked.

231
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,654
Sidebar-- I forgot
to get my cousin David

232
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,356
something for his bar mitzvah
last week.

233
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:02,374
Could you send the hooker
to his room?

234
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,510
Wait, Marshall called you, too?

235
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,263
NARRATOR: <i>Turns out I wasn't</i>
<i>Marshall's first call.</i>

236
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,897
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

237
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,033
At a wedding?
(laughing)

238
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,685
Yeah, that's romantic.

239
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,819
I just wish I would've

240
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,154
known about the guns.
Well,

241
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,555
I wish I'd known
about the doves.

242
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,190
That's the problem with
us-- we don't think

243
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,026
about checking in with the other
person before doing something.

244
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,278
Honestly, I think

245
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,229
that's what broke us up
the first time.

246
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,198
We're both... lone wolves--

247
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,534
always off in our own worlds.

248
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,203
That's not gonna work.

249
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,188
Not in a marriage, no.

250
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,324
What? Sorry, I was thinking
about getting the doves

251
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,293
little Kevlar tuxedos,
but that's not gonna work--

252
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:39,211
there's no time for a fitting.

253
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,629
(phone rings)
Hey.

254
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,498
Listen, I need you
to get to Lily's phone

255
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,667
without her seeing, and delete
the last text she got.

256
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:45,751
Why? What did you...

257
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,035
And I need you to do it

258
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:48,420
no questions asked.

259
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,558
As you'll recall, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

260
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,228
(phone rings)
Hello?

261
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,714
Marshall, I need you to rush
to the Macy's in Herald Square,

262
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:00,549
find the utility closet
on the third floor,

263
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:01,984
and bring me
the following things:

264
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,436
a clean pair of underwear,
a clean pair of pants,

265
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,939
a box of moist towelettes,
hand sanitizer,

266
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:10,526
and a garbage bag,
no questions asked.

267
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:11,860
You deuced your pants.

268
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,365
Never mind.

269
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,752
Ha. You didn't wind up
helping me, so it doesn't count.

270
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,069
Yes, I'm the one
Face!

271
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:22,788
who should be embarrassed
by that story.

272
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,540
But that wasn't
the time I meant.

273
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,074
This was last fall.

274
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,293
Hey, I got here as
fast as I could.

275
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,678
Are you okay?
Yeah, fine.

276
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,513
Th-These quacks said I was...
(scoffs)

277
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,383
unfit to leave on my own.
Blah, blah, blah.

278
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,418
"Danger to myself."
Blah, blah, blah.

279
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,754
"Whoever signs me out is legally
responsible for my actions."

280
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,255
I just need you to sign me out.

281
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,273
What the hell happened?

282
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,558
Uh-uh!

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,476
I said no questions asked.

284
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,278
W...

285
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,032
Star, clover, horseshoe.

286
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:52,067
Barney, did you swallow
real versions

287
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,786
of all the Lucky Charms items?

288
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,706
No... questions... asked.

289
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
Now come on. Let's hit
the bar. I'm buying.

290
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,710
I just won 50 bucks from
a little Irish guy on a dare.

291
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,880
Fine, I'll delete the text.

292
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,498
But how am I supposed to get
into Lily's room?

293
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,801
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted...

294
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,552
Air ducts!
What?

295
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,721
I'll use the system of air ducts
to get in her room,

296
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,956
just like the bad guy
in <i>Die Hard.</i>

297
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,309
Barney, Bruce Willis is not
the bad guy in <i>Die H...</i>

298
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,396
Not important. The point is,
the door is not lock...

299
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,130
I'll call you when it's done.

300
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:23,932
ROBIN:
Anyway, I was saying,

301
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,018
I think we need to be better
about talking to each other

302
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,236
before doing stuff.

303
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,404
Can't talk. Doing stuff.

304
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
(grunting)
(grate clatters)

305
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,992
What is going on?

306
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,445
(groans)

307
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,330
Barney, what are you doing
in there?

308
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:42,534
Uh, well, there is
a story there.

309
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,821
It involves a trained
Guatemalan kinkajou,

310
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,840
a Bolshoi Ballet
prima ballerina

311
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,459
and Olympic gold medalist
Duke Kahanamoku's surfboard.

312
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,628
Tell her, Ted.

313
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,130
Uh...

314
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,015
uh...

315
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,517
uh...
The kinkajou...

316
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,136
the kinkajou...
(knocking)

317
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,640
Oh, God, what is it now?

318
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,508
Good evening,
Ms. Aldrin.

319
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,811
I didn't order room service.

320
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:10,679
It says right here, room 13.

321
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,815
Lobster, caviar, champagne.

322
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,650
$400?!

323
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,702
I didn't order any of this.

324
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,020
Maybe Dearduff the Hooker
ordered it.

325
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:22,040
Well, I'm not paying for room
service the Hooker ordered!

326
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,960
I've been there.
LILY: Okay,

327
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:28,163
you know what? I need to
talk to the manager.

328
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,301
All right,
where's that damn phone?

329
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,470
You, too?!

330
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:35,754
(groans)

331
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,973
(phone rings)

332
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,842
Hey.
MARSHALL: Robin,

333
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,510
I need you to delete
the last text

334
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,011
that Lily got
before she sees it.

335
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,097
Bro, it's my wedding weekend.

336
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,431
Just because
you didn't know better

337
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,883
than to take a naked selfie

338
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,735
while you were in the coldest
part of the country...

339
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:51,270
First, I'm an Eriksen.

340
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,555
Cold has a plumping effect.

341
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:56,775
Second, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

342
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,028
All right, I'm-I'm at the alley
near 22nd and 2nd. Now what?

343
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,947
ROBIN: No questions asked. Tell me
about that giant trout

344
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,500
you and your dad caught
ice-fishing that one time.

345
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,119
Well, it was more beast
than trout.

346
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,705
Fought us for three hours
and nearly dragged us both

347
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,406
into Lake Winnibigoshish.

348
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,091
It was this big, and...

349
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,793
(grunts)
Hey.

350
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,712
Run!

351
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,636
I never asked you
who those weirdos were,

352
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,421
why they kept calling you
Night Falcon

353
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,941
or even what was in those darts
that they were blowing at us.

354
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,592
Your vision came back,
didn't it?

355
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,594
(sighs)
Wuss.

356
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,196
Fine, I'll take care of it.

357
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,698
Just have to figure out
how to get into Lily's room.

358
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
Her door doesn't lock.
You can just...

359
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,902
Room service!

360
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,119
Night Falcon, you're a genius.

361
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,322
I'll call you when it's done.

362
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,158
Why would he call

363
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,243
you guys before me?
Well, dude,

364
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,545
you're not great in a crisis.

365
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,663
What was that story
you were prattling on about?

366
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,048
What the hell
is a kinkajou?

367
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay, let's just find it
before she gets back.

368
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,584
NIGHT CLERK:
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

369
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,586
You ordered it,
so you have to pay for it.

370
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,955
Not to mention the room damage
you're responsible for.

371
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,406
I've got
a report here:

372
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,308
broken lock, faulty Wi-Fi,

373
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,727
you've taken several items
from the minibar...

374
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:07,379
There is no minibar.

375
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,814
Stolen minibar.

376
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,649
It's not here.

377
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,517
Well, where else would it be?

378
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,652
Okay.

379
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,822
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

380
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,273
Uh-oh.

381
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,662
Okay, we need to get to Lily's
phone before she sees that text.

382
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,112
I'm on it.
Night Falcon is on it.

383
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,914
Good thing I packed my unitard.

384
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,915
(groans)

385
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,786
(panting)

386
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,764
This is exactly
what we always do, isn't it?

387
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:35,357
Yeah.

388
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,624
We were both gonna bolt off
and lone wolf it

389
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,127
without telling
the other person a thing.

390
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,180
Why do we do that?
I don't know.

391
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,567
Maybe we're just incapable
of working as a unit.

392
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,569
(sighs)

393
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,906
You know...

394
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:55,442
I bet even lone wolves
can learn to work together.

395
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,028
I'd like to think so.

396
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,149
They could build their little
woodland den together.

397
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,335
Roam together.

398
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,753
Hunt together.

399
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:08,155
Lure prey into
a tight corner and...

400
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,507
BOTH: Snap its limbs
with our powerful jaws

401
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,043
and watch the life drain
from its eyes.

402
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,129
BOTH:
Aw...

403
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,498
Point is, we're gonna
make a great team.

404
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,684
We'll just need
some practice.

405
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,305
Yeah. Yeah, let's prove
that we believe in marriage

406
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,672
by working together

407
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,442
to help Marshall
hide something from his wife.

408
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:35,282
ROBIN: <i>First, we take position</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

409
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,237
BARNEY:
<i>Then you cause a distraction.</i>

410
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,022
(silenced gunshot)
(vase shatters)

411
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,826
ROBIN: <i>Then you send in a trained dove</i>
<i>to grab Lily's phone.</i>

412
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,828
BARNEY: <i>The dove drops the phone</i>
<i>into your hand.</i>

413
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,363
<i>You delete the text</i>

414
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,498
<i>and toss it back</i>
<i>on the counter.</i>

415
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,218
♪

416
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,703
Wait.
(sighs)

417
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,672
It's absolutely insane...

418
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,842
...how foolproof this plan is!

419
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,894
Sometimes it's best
to just go simple.

420
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,813
Yep.

421
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,349
(coughing)

422
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:09,817
Wh-Why do you have a gun?

423
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,435
Why do you always have a gun?

424
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,519
(quietly):
Where's Lily?

425
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,904
She went up 20 minutes ago.

426
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,356
You're kidding.

427
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,491
Courtney Dove, no!

428
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,109
I already lost Kurt Coo-bain!

429
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,228
I can't lose you as well.

430
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,414
Great. How are we gonna
get Lily's phone back now?

431
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,948
Oh, I already took care of that.

432
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,400
And now I'm rewarding myself

433
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,369
with some of the inn's
finest brandy.

434
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:29,286
Bottoms up.

435
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,287
Well, thank you.

436
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,338
No, no, that's a warning.

437
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,373
The dove's about to...

438
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,541
(cooing)

439
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:35,709
What happened?

440
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,378
Well...

441
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,631
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

442
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,633
(phone ringing)

443
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:47,921
Hi, baby.

444
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,441
You are never gonna
believe this, but... (phone chimes)

445
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,143
Uh, someone sent me a text.

446
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,946
TED:
Lily, stop!

447
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,448
Why?

448
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,116
Because...

449
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,435
because...

450
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,820
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's when I realized</i>

451
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,605
<i>that the answer</i>
<i>had been there all along.</i>

452
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,991
Throw your phone on the ground
and smash it with your foot.

453
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,159
What? No.
I need you

454
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,128
to do this no questions asked.

455
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,248
You owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

456
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,633
Hey, Lil. What's...
Ted, I need you

457
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,385
to come
to my classroom right now

458
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,003
with two dozen cupcakes
and a box cutter.

459
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,772
No questions asked.

460
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,790
Lily, I brought the...

461
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,342
Oh-oh, my God.

462
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,593
Ted,

463
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,795
put the cupcakes at the feet
of their leader,

464
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,130
then cut me loose.

465
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,815
Don't make eye contact!

466
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,101
(children chanting)

467
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,319
Ted...

468
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,773
No... questions... asked.

469
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,446
(Lily stomping)

470
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,782
Well, interesting that I was
the one who fixed everything

471
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:51,251
even though Marshall
called me...

472
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,120
third.
NARRATOR: <i>Ninth,</i>

473
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:55,706
<i>as I found out later,</i>
<i>but I won't go into it.</i>

474
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,291
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>is what happened</i>

475
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:00,377
<i>right after the untimely death</i>
<i>of Lily's phone.</i>

476
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,463
So you're saying
you didn't order room service

477
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,132
and you didn't order
<i>Prison Sluts Nine?</i>

478
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:09,520
I am saying I did not order
room service.

479
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:11,939
It is done. By me.

480
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,691
Your third call.

481
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,343
Actually, you were...

482
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,562
Thank you. H-How did you do it?

483
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,564
I called in a "No Questions
Asked" with Lily.

484
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,848
But, wait,
why didn't you do that?

485
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,283
You must have, like,
a million of those.

486
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,202
<i>And Marshall thought back.</i>

487
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,520
Hello?

488
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,571
Hey, baby, it's me.

489
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,456
Um, can you come bail me
out of jail?

490
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,858
I thought I saw Bigfoot
in Central Park

491
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,193
and so I tackled him,

492
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,547
but it turned out
to be Russell Brand.

493
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,549
Hey...

494
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,919
Oh, do you mind looking up
our vaccination records?

495
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,556
I tried to hug a raccoon.

496
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,724
Hey, babe, um,

497
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,042
could you dig up our warranty?

498
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,711
I took the TV apart, and I made

499
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,981
a robot out of it.

500
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,182
(phone rings)
Hello?

501
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,433
Hey.

502
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,735
I tackled
Russell Brand again.

503
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,655
I've never asked Lily to do
anything no questions asked

504
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,490
because...

505
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,993
I've never wanted to.

506
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,727
She's the love of my life.

507
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,532
I never keep anything from her.

508
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:14,585
(sighs)
Ted, put Lily on the phone.

509
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,071
Hey. It's Marshall.

510
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,593
Want to tell me what's going on?

511
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,411
Yes.

512
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,264
I was offered a judgeship
in New York.

513
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,966
And I took it.

514
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,886
Even though we already agreed
to move to Rome.

515
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,055
I'm gonna be a judge.

516
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,109
Lily?

517
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:43,447
You know, Marshall,
I don't believe in ghosts,

518
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,150
and I'm not sure anyone died
in our room,

519
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,536
but someone's going to.

520
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,738
(thunder rumbles)
(Dearduff laughing manically)

521
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,860
"And I see in your eyes
