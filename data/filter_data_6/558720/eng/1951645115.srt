1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,600
My name is Mary Alice Young.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
When you read this morning's paper, you may come across an article

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,100
about the unusual day I had last week.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life,

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,900
but that all changed last thursday.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,800
I made breakfast for my family.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
I performed my chores.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I completed my projects.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
I ran my errands.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day --

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,900
quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,700
That's why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,100
and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
My body was discovered by my neighbor mrs. Martha Huber,

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,300
who had been startled by a strange popping sound.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Her curiosity aroused,

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,100
After some initial hesitation,

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,100
she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,500
It's my neighbor. I think she's been shot.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,300
There's blood everywhere.

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Yes. You've got to send an ambulance. You've got to send one right now.

24
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,300
And for a moment,

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,100
mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen,

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,100
grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy...

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,100
But only for a moment.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,100
If there was one thing mrs. Huber was known for,

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
it was her ability to look on the bright side.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,000
I was laid to rest on a monday.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
After the funeral, all the residents of wisteria lane came to pay their respects.

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,300
And, as people do in these situations, they brought food.

33
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.

34
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.

35
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Of course, she didn't cook much while she was moving up the corporate ladder.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
She didn't have the time.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,900
But when her doctor announced Lynette was pregnant,

38
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,400
her husband Tom had an idea.

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
"Why not quit your job?

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,900
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms. It would be so much less stressful."

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,700
But this was not the case.

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic,

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,900
she was now forced to get her fried chicken from a fast-food restaurant.

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Lynette would have appreciated the irony if she stopped to think about it,

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,700
but she couldn't. She didn't have the time.

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
- Stop it !
- But, mom!

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,000
No,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,100
you are going to behave today.

49
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,100
I am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,000
And just so you know how serious I am...

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,300
what's that?

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,400
Santa's cell phone number.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,300
How'd you get that?

54
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,100
I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf,

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,100
and if any of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa,

56
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,700
and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
You willing to risk that?

58
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Okay. Let's get this over with.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Gabrielle Solis, who lives down the block,

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,800
brought a spicy paella.

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
Since her modeling days in New York,

62
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food...

63
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,300
and rich men.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Carlos, who worked in mergersnd acquisitions,

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,600
proposed on their third date.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes,

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,100
but she soon discovered this happened

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,400
every time Carlos closed the big deal.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,900
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,700
I want you to casually mention how much I paid for your necklace.

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,800
He let me know how much he paid for his wife's new convertible.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Why don't I just pin the receipt to my chest?

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
Look, just work it into the conversation.

76
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
There's no way I can just work that in, Carlos.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,500
Why not?

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,300
At the Donoghue party, everyone was talking mutual funds,

79
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
and you found a way to mention you slept with half the Yankee outfield.

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.

81
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Hey, people are starting to stare. Can you keep your voice down, please?

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Absolutely. We wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,100
Bree van de Kamp, who lives next door,

84
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,400
Bree was known for her cooking,

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
and for making her own clothes,

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,200
and for doing her own gardening,

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
and for reupholstering her own furniture.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood,

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,300
and everyone on Wisteria lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.

91
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Everyone, that is, except her own family.

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,300
Paul. Zachary.

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,800
Hello, mrs. Van De Kamp.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Bree, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,100
It was no trouble at all.

96
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Now, the basket with the red ribbon is filled with desserts for your guests,

97
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,100
but the one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,200
It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast-type things.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Thank you.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Well, the least I could do is

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,900
I know you're out of your minds with grief.

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes, we are.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Of course, I will need the baskets back once you're done.

105
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Of course.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,100
Susan Mayer, who lives across the street,

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,300
brought macaroni and cheese.

108
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Her husband Carl always teased her about her macaroni,

109
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,600
saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook,

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
and she rarely made it well.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,700
It was too salty the night she and Carl moved into their house.

112
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Carl's shirt.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
She burned it the night carl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A year had passed since the divorce.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life,

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
even one who would make fun of her cooking.

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Mom... why would someone kill themselves?

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,400
Well... sometimes people are so unhappy,

119
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
they think that's the only way they can solve their problems.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
But mrs. Young always seemed happy.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside when they're totally different on the inside.

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Oh, you mean like how dad's girlfriend always smiling and says nice things,

123
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,500
but deep down, you just know she's a bitch?

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,400
I don't like that word, Julie.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
But, yeah, that's a great example.

126
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,500
Hey, what's going on? Sorry I'm late.

127
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,400
Hi, susan.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Hey. So, what did Carl say when you confronted him?

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,700
You'll love this. He said...

130
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
"it doesn't mean anything. It was just sex."

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, "you know, Susan,

133
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,100
most men live lives of quiet desperation."

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Please tell me you punched him.

135
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,600
No, I said, "really? And what do most women lead

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
lives of noisy fulfillment?"

137
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Hmm. Good for you.

138
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,600
I mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? I had that woman over for brunch.

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
It's like my grandmother always said -- an erect penis doesn't have a conscience.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,400
Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
This is half the reason I joined the NRA.

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,700
Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences,

143
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,700
I wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
with a loaded Smith & Wesson.

145
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Lynnie, Tom's always away on business. Do you ever worry he might?

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years.

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I wish he was having sex with someone else.

148
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
So, Susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,900
I don't know.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm sorry, you guys. I just...

151
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I just don't know how I'm going to survive this.

152
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Listen to me.

153
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
We all have moments of desperation.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
But if we can face them head-on, that's when we find out just how strong we really are.

155
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Susan. I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday.

156
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,100
He needs us to go through Mary Alice's closetand help pack up her things.

157
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,300
He said he can't face doing it by himself.

158
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,400
Sure. That's fine.

159
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,100
Are you okay?

160
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Yeah.

161
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm just so angry.

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,600
If Mary Alice was having problems,she should have come to us.

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,100
She should have let us help her.

164
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,400
What kind of problems could she have had?

165
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,900
She was healthy, had a great home, a nice family.

166
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,900
- Her life was...
- Our life.

167
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,000
No, if Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
She lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes.

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,000
Gabby, the woman killed herself.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Something must have been going on.

171
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
I wouldn't eat that if I were you.

172
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Why?

173
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I made it. Trust me.

174
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,100
Hey, hey, do you -- do you have a death wish?

175
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,100
No, I just refuse to believe that anybody cans crew up macaroni and cheese.

176
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, my god.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How did you -- it tastes like it's burned and undercooked.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.

179
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Ha ha. Thanks.

180
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm Mike Delfino. I just started renting the simms house next door.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

182
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh, yeah, mrs. Huber told me about you.

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
Said you illustrate children's books.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,900
Yeah, I'm very big with the under-5 set.

185
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
- What do you do?
- Plumber.

186
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
So if you ever have a clog...

187
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
or something.

188
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Now that everybody's seen that I brought something,

189
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I should probably just throw this out.

190
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Ease up, you little vampire.

191
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,300
Lynette, I've been looking all over for you.

192
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Are you aware of what your sons are doing?

193
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,900
What are you doing? We are at a wake.

194
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,700
When we got here, you said we could go in the pool.

195
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,700
I said you could go by the pool.

196
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,400
Do you have your swimsuits on?

197
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Yeah, we put them under our clothes before we left.

198
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,300
You three planned this? All right. That's it. Get out!

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
- No!
- No?

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,500
I am your mother. You have to do what I say. Come on.

201
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,600
We want to swim, and you can't stop us!

202
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Get out, or I will get in this pool and just grab you. Get out!

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Get over here.

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Get -- get over here!

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
All right, give me your arm. Get back --

206
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Move it! That's right! Get over here!

207
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,100
Paul, we have to leave now.

208
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.

209
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,900
Go.

210
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband.

211
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,200
He had other things on his mind --

212
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
things below the surface.

213
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,800
The morning after my funeral,

214
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,800
my friends and neighbors quietly went back to their busy, busy lives.

215
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
While some did their cooking...

216
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
and some did their cleaning...

217
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
and some did their yoga...

218
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
others did their homework.

219
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Hi.

220
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm Julie. I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
Oh, okay. Well, let's go around and get it.

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Stay.

223
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
His wife died a year ago.

224
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,800
He wanted to stay in L.A., but there were too many memories.

225
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
He's renting for tax purposes, but he hopes to buy a place real soon.

226
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,300
I can't believe you went over there.

227
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
You're obviously into each other.

229
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,000
Now that you know he's single, you can ask him out.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
Julie, I like mr. Delfino, I do.

231
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,400
I just, uh, I don't even know if I'm ready to start dating yet.

232
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
Oh, you need to get back out there.

233
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Come on. How long has it been since you've had sex?

234
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Are you mad that I asked you that?

235
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,400
No, I'm just trying to remember.

236
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
I don't want to talk to you about my love life anymore. It weirds me out.

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,500
I wouldn't have said anything. It's just...

238
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
What?

239
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I heard dad's girlfriend ask if you'd dated anyone since the divorce,

240
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
and dad said he doubted it.

241
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,700
And then they both laughed.

242
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,400
- Susan.
- Hi, Mike.

243
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,900
I brought you a little housewarming gift.

244
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,600
I probably should have brought something by earlier, but...

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,200
actually, you're the first in the neighborhood to stop by.

246
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Really?

247
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,900
Susan knews he was lucky.

248
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,900
An eligible bachelor had moved onto wisteria lane,

249
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,000
and she was the first to find out,

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but she also knew that good news...

251
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,000
Travels quickly.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Edie Britt was the most predatory divorcée in a 5-block radius.

253
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Her conquests were numerous...

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
varied...

255
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
and legendary.

256
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Hi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting.

257
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
You must be Mike Delfino. Hi, I'm Edie. Britt.

258
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I live over there.

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Welcome to Wisteria lane.

260
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Susan had met the enemy, and she was a slut.

261
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Thank you. Ha ha. What's this?

262
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Sausage putanesca. It's just something I threw together.

263
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,800
Well, thanks, Edie. Ha ha. That's great.

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,100
I'd invite you both in, but I was sort of in the middle of something.

265
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.

266
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,300
For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie would remain friendly.

267
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,700
Oh, Mike. I heard you're a plumber?

268
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,600
But she was reminded that when it came to men...

269
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
do you think you could stop by later tonight and take a look at my pipes?

270
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,400
- Women don't fight fair.
- Sure.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,900
Thanks.

272
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Bye, Susan.

273
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
You can't order me around like I'm a child.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
- Gabrielle.
- No. No, no, no. I'm not going.

275
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,000
It's business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.

277
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Ha ha. I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.

278
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.

279
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,700
Mr. Solis. You scared me.

280
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Why is that bush still there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.

281
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,900
I didn't have time last week.

282
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
I don't want to hear your excuses. Just take care of it.

283
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,500
I really hate the way you talk to me.

284
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,300
And I really hate that I spend $15,000

285
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,800
on your diamond necklace that you couldn't live without,

286
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,000
but I'm learning to deal with it.

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
So can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow night?

288
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
John. We have bandage stop shelf in the kitchen.

289
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Thanks, mrs. Solis.

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Fine. I'll go.

291
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,700
But I'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.

292
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,700
See? Now this is what a marriage is all about -- compromise.

293
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
Is your finger okay?

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
Yeah, yeah, it's just a small cut.

295
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Let me see.

296
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Hmm. You know, mrs. Solis,

297
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Um, I really like it when we hook up,

298
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,700
but, um, well, you know, I-I got to get my work done,

299
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
and I can't afford to lose this job.

300
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,000
This table is hand-carved.

301
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,500
Carlos had it imported from Italy.

302
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
It cost him $23,000.

303
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
You want to do it on the table this time?

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Absolutely.

305
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
Why can't we ever have normal soup?

306
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,700
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.

307
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Just once, couldn't we have a soup that people have heard of?

308
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,400
Like french onion or navy bean.

309
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,000
First of all, your father can't eat onions. He's deathly allergic.

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion.

311
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
So... how's the osso buco?

312
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
It's okay.

313
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
It's okay?

314
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,300
Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.

315
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,300
How do you think it makes me feel when you say "it's okay" in that sullen tone?

316
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?

317
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Excuse me?

318
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work,

319
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,600
pops open a can of pork and beans,

320
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
and boom, they're eating. Everyone's happy.

321
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,600
You'd rather I serve pork and beans?

322
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,700
Apologize now. I am begging.

323
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm saying, do you always have to serve cuisine?

324
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,700
Can't we ever just have food?

325
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,900
Are you doing drugs?

326
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,700
What?

327
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,900
Change in behavior is one of the warning signs,

328
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,800
and you have been as fresh as paint for the last six months.

329
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,700
That certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.

330
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,300
- Trust me, that is not what he is doing.
- Shut up.

331
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,800
Mom, I'm not the one with the problem here, all right?

332
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
You're the one always acting like she's running for mayor of Stepford.

333
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,600
Rex.

334
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Seeing that you're the head of this household, I would really appreciate you saying something.

335
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Pass the salt?

336
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
Three days after my funeral,

337
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,000
Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion --

338
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,700
indignation.

339
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Tom, this is my fifth message, and you still haven't called me back.

340
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. I can only imagine.

341
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,100
Well, guess what -- the kids and I want to have some fun, too,

342
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
so unless you call me back by noon,

343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
we are getting on a plane and joining you.

344
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,300
Mom!

345
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Not now, honey. Mommy's threatening daddy.

346
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Mom. No, I -- where are your brothers?

347
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,300
- Noodles.
- My favorite.

348
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,200
Lynette Scavo?

349
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Crap.

350
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Natalie Klein. I don't believe it.

351
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,200
Lynette. How long has it been?

352
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Years.

353
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Uh, how are you? How's the firm?

354
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Good. Everyone misses you.

355
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,200
Yeah. We all say if you hadn't quit,

356
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
you'd be running the place by now.

357
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Yeah, well...

358
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So... how's domestic life?

359
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Don't you just love being a mom?

360
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
And there it was -- the question that Lynette always dreaded.

361
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,400
Well, to be honest...

362
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
for those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable,

363
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,400
so Lynette responded as she always did.

364
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,700
She lied.

365
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
It's the best job I've ever had.

366
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
You know what I don't get?

367
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
What?

368
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Why you married mr. Solis.

369
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,900
Well... he promised to give me everything I've ever wanted.

370
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
And did he?

371
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,400
Yes.

372
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,700
Then why aren't you happy?

373
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,200
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

374
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,900
So do you love him?

375
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,700
I do.

376
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?

377
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,200
Because I don't want to wake up one morning

378
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.

379
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Hey, can I have a drag?

380
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Absolutely not.

381
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You are much too young to smoke.

382
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,300
Ah. How would you feel about me using your child-support payments

383
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,600
for plastic surgery?

384
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Stop being so nervous. You're just asking him out to dinner. It's no big deal.

385
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,900
You're right.

386
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
So is that your project for school?

387
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You know, when I was in fifth grade, I made the white house out of sugar cubes.

388
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Stop stalling and go

389
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,000
before mike figures out he can do better.

390
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.

391
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,200
You were using me to hurt dad.

392
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Oh, that's right.

393
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Oh, god.

394
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,100
- Hi.
- Hey, Susan.

395
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,400
- Are you busy?
- No, not at all. What's up?

396
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Well, I -- I just, uh, was wondering if, um...

397
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,200
if there was any chance that you, uh...

398
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,900
I-I just wanted to ask if...

399
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
- Edie.
- Hey there, Susan.

400
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
What are you --

401
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,000
I was making ambrosia, and I made too much,

402
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
so I thought I'd bring some over to mike.

403
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,700
What's going on?

404
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,800
Uh, Susan was just going to ask me something.

405
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
I have a clog.

406
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,100
- Excuse me?
- And you're a plumber, right?

407
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,600
Yeah.

408
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,300
The clog's in the pipe.

409
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,800
Yeah, that's usually where they are.

410
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Well, I've got one.

411
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,100
Oh, okay. Well, uh let me get my tools.

412
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
Now? You want to come over now?

413
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,900
You have company.

414
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,600
I don't mind.

415
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah, just give me two minutes.

416
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll be right over. That's it. Just stuff the hair down there.

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I stuffed it. It's not enough to clog it.

418
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Here. Okay, look. Put in this peanut butter

419
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
and this cooking oil.

420
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
- Mom
- And these olives.

421
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Mom, I'm telling you, it's not working.

422
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,800
Oh, god. That's him.

423
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,900
How am I going to stop up the sink?

424
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,400
Well, here's your problem.

425
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Looks like somebody stuffed a bunch of popsicle sticks down here.

426
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I've told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen.

427
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Kids, you know?

428
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,300
All right, I'll go put in your orders,

429
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,100
and I'll be right back with your drinks and your plates for the salad bar.

430
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Thank you.

431
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Andrew, Danielle, napkins?

432
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,600
They have video games.

433
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,100
Could we go play until our food gets here?

434
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,400
Andrew, this is family time.

435
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
- I think that we should all
- Go ahead and play.

436
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,500
I know that you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not.

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,700
You and the kids wanted a change of pace,

438
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
something fun. I get it.

439
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,700
Probably we'll want something healthier tomorrow night, though.

440
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm thinking about chicken Saltimbocca.

441
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I want a divorce.

442
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I just can't live in this --

443
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,100
this detergent commercial anymore.

444
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
- The salad bar's right over there. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

445
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,700
Um, I think I'll go get your salad for you.

446
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Bree Van De Kamp.

447
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Oh. Hello, mrs. Huber.

448
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
We didn't get a chance to talk at Mary Alice's wake.

449
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,600
How are you doing?

450
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Bree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal,

451
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
but sadly for Bree,

452
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,400
admitting defeat was not an option.

453
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Great. Everything is just great.

454
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing. The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.

455
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,500
Are we going to talk about what I said?

456
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
If you think I'm going to discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place

457
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
where the restrooms are labeled "chicks" and "dudes,"

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you're out of your mind.

459
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,800
What's in this?

460
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,800
What do you mean, what's in this? It's salad.

461
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,500
- With -- with onions?
- What?

462
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,100
You put onions in my salad.

463
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,100
No, I didn't.

464
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Oh, wait.

465
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
The sound that awakened my son

466
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,200
was something he'd heard only once before,

467
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
many years ago when he was quite young,

468
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
but he recognized it instantly.

469
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,300
It was the sound of a family secret.

470
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,900
Seven days after my funeral,

471
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
life on Wisteria lane finally returned to normal,

472
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,700
which, for some of my friends...

473
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
was unfortunate.

474
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,000
Now what?

475
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Daddy's home!

476
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Hey, is anybody home?

477
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,100
I wasn't expecting you for a week.

478
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,800
I have to go back to frisco in the morning,

479
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,900
but I got your call. You sounded a little frazzled.

480
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Yeah. It's been a little rough.

481
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,900
Daddy, did you bring us any presents?

482
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Oh, god, presents. Wait a minute let me see.

483
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
But I'm not going to give it to you unless you promise me to go outside right now

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,700
and practice throwing it for 20 minutes, okay? You promise?

485
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get out of here. Go.

486
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,500
Who's open? Go out!

487
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,800
Deeper! Deeper!

488
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,500
Touchdown!

489
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,600
Oh, my god. Oh.

490
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Oh, you got to be kidding. I'm exhausted.

491
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,900
I look terrible. I'm covered in peaches.

492
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
That's all right, baby. I got to have you.

493
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,400
Well, is it okay if I just lie here?

494
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Absolutely.

495
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,900
I love you.

496
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
And I love you more.

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,900
Oh, wait, I got to tell you, I was having trouble with swelling,

498
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,800
so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just going to have to put on a condom.

499
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Condom? What's the big deal? Let's risk it.

500
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
- Let's risk it?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,400
I can't believe you tried to kill me.

502
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Yes, well, I feel badly about that.

503
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I told you, mrs. Huber came over, and I got distracted.

504
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
It was a mistake.

505
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,600
Since when do you make mistakes?

506
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,700
What's that supposed to mean?

507
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,700
It means I'm sick of you being so damn perfect all the time.

508
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I-I'm sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn't move.

509
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm sick of you making our bed in the morning before I've even used the bathroom.

510
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
You're this plastic suburban housewife

511
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,500
with her pearls and her spatula

512
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
who says things like "we owe the hendersons a dinner."

513
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Where's the woman I fell in love with...

514
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
who used to burn the toast and drink milk out of the carton...

515
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,700
and laugh?

516
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,700
I need her.

517
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Not this cold, perfect thing you've become.

518
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
These need water.

519
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes,

520
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
but he husband never knew,

521
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
because when Bree finally emerged...

522
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
she was perfect.

523
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,000
I found my earrings. We can go now.

524
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,500
Was John here today?

525
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Well, yeah.

526
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,200
The lawn hasn't been mowed. I've had it.

527
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,500
We're getting a real gardener.

528
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
- Why?
- Are you deaf?

529
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,600
I just said he's not doing his job.

530
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
It dark. You just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.

531
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,300
It hasn't been. Feel this grass.

532
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
I'm not feeling the grass.

533
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Let's just get going. Come on. We're late.

534
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,600
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,900
There's Tanaka.

536
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,700
Time for me to go into my dance.

537
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Good luck, sweetheart.

538
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh, excuse me. Ma'am? You see that man who just walked away?

539
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?

540
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh, mrs. Huber,how you doing?

542
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,600
Not too well, I'm afraid.

543
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,100
I'm trying to find something to soothe my stomach.

544
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,700
Oh, it's upset?

545
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Yeah. I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.

546
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,200
It's been running through me ever since.

547
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,900
And I need to be at my best.

548
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,800
Edie Bri's son is spending the night tonight.

549
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
He's spending the night?

550
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Apparently, Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner,

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours,

552
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,100
if you know what I mean.

553
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Oh, here's some antacid. Have you ever tried this?

554
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400
I can't believe it.

555
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
This can't be happening. Mike can't like Edie better than me. He just can't.

556
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,100
You don't know what's going on.

557
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Maybe they're just having dinner.

558
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
You're right. They're doing it.

559
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
Edie?

560
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,600
Anybody home?

561
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,700
I need to borrow sugar.

562
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,600
And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to,

563
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.

564
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,100
And despite the precariousness of her situation,

565
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.

566
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It didn't take Susan long to realize this was just not her night.

567
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,400
Is somebody out there?

568
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,900
Oh, my god!

569
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
That's smoke!

570
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
...candles unattended in the den.

571
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,300
Paramedics said she was lucky. She could have been killed.

572
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
She ran out with nothing on.

573
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.

574
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,300
What happened to him?

575
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,300
He got smoke inhalation. He's at the hospital.

576
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,600
Susan, are you all right? You look awful.

577
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm fine. I'm fine.

578
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I-I just, uh... feel really bad for Edie.

579
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh, honey, don't worry about Edie. She's a strong lady.

580
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Absolutely. She'll get through this.

581
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
She'll find a way to survive.

582
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
We all do.

583
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Come on.

584
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,100
Wow, what happened?

585
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,800
Mike.

586
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,900
And suddenly, there he was,

587
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,300
like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

588
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,200
I-I thought you were --

589
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Uh, where were you?

590
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,400
I just got back from the movies. Edie had a fire, huh?

591
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,700
Yeah.

592
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Yeah, but she's fine now.

593
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500
Everything's fine now.

594
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,200
And just like that, Susan was happy.

595
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Life was suddenly full of... possibilities.

596
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,100
Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.

597
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,600
Hello? Hey, it's me.

598
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,300
- Do you have anything yet?
- No.

599
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,400
No, nothing yet, but don't worry.

600
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
I'm definitely getting closer.

601
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
I brought some champagne.

602
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,700
I thought we should have a toast.

603
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,700
The next day, my friends came together

604
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings,

605
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,800
and what was left of my life.

606
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,300
All right, ladies, lift 'em up.

607
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,500
To Mary Alice --

608
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
a good friend and neighbor.

609
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,600
Wherever you are, we hope you've found peace.

610
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
To Mary Alice.

611
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
Let's get this show on the road.

612
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,900
You guys check out Mary Alice's clothes?

613
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,700
Size 8? Ha.

614
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,900
She always told me she was a size 6.

615
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Guess we found the skeleton in her closet.

616
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,400
Not quite, Gabrielle.

617
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Not quite.

618
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
What's that?

619
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,200
It's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.

620
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,700
How ironic --

621
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,300
to have something I tried so desperately to keep secret

622
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,500
treated so casually.

623
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,800
What are you doing? That's private.

624
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,800
It's open. What's the big deal?

625
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,600
I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell.

626
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,900
What does this mean ?

627
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,600
I don't know but check out the post mark.

628
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Oh my god! She got it the day she died.

629
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,700
Do you think this is why she...

630
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm so sorry, girls.

631
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,000
I never wanted you to be burdened with this.

632
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Mary Alice, what did you do ?

633
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,300
