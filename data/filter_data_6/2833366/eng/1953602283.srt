1
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,712
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:07,782
Penny, have you been recording
shows on our DVR again?

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,549
No.

4
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,439
Answer honestly.
This is not a trial.

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,602
That'll come later.

6
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,898
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,042
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,188
Yeah.

9
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,572
Uh... maybe we were hacked.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,634
You know, the Chinese have been
hacking everything lately.

11
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:31,385
Why would the Chinese make our
DVR record <i>Paul Blart: Mall Cop?</i>

12
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,098
I don't know.

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,153
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

14
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,176
I'm deleting it.

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,467
Well, hang on.

16
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,569
Maybe the Chinese haven't
finished watching it yet.

17
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,544
You know, if you're trying
to make space on the DVR,

18
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,801
why don't you just get rid of some
of the stuff you've already watched?

19
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,703
Like, um... <i>Alphas.</i>

20
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:54,698
No, that's the season two finale.
That was quite the cliffhanger.

21
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:56,993
I'm going to re-watch it
before season three starts.

22
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,887
There is no season three.
They canceled that show.

23
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,412
Well, they can't cancel it.

24
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:06,240
It ended on a cliffhanger.

25
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,453
- They did.
- Uh, Sheldon,

26
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:10,134
there are two dumplings left.
Do you want them?

27
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,018
Dumplings?

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,227
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

29
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,341
As a rule, no.

30
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,582
That show ended with all
the residents of New York

31
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:20,380
either dead or unconscious.

32
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,366
Now I'll never know
what happened.

33
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:24,457
Well, why don't you
make up your own ending?

34
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,062
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.

35
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,465
And after that, I'll make up
my own rules of oral hygiene.

36
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,192
You know, instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

37
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:36,690
I'm going to get the number of the
SyFy Channel and give them what for.

38
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:38,309
Oh, please, don't do that.

39
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,840
No. They can't just cancel
a show like <i>Alphas.</i>

40
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:43,429
You know? They have to help
the viewers let go.

41
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:46,112
<i>Firefly</i> did a movie
to wrap things up.

42
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,260
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>
continued on as a comic book.

43
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:52,508
<i>Heroes</i> gradually lowered
the quality season by season

44
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,680
till we were grateful it ended.

45
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,831
I feel bad for whoever
gets that phone call.

46
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,031
Ah, don't.

47
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,917
If they didn't want to be
yelled at by crazy nerds,

48
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:03,087
they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

Original Air Date on April 25, 2013

00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,847
Resync for WEB-DL by Norther

59
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,513
I think you're gonna be really
happy with this security camera.

60
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:34,405
The optics are great, it's
got infrared technology,

61
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:37,847
and there's even a backup battery
when the power goes out.

62
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,567
Whatever.

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,731
I can see my little princess
while I'm at work, right?

64
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:46,410
Why can't you just watch porn
like a regular guy?

65
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,759
I need your laptop so I can
configure the software.

66
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,197
Wait, hold on.

67
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,714
This is weird.

68
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,458
What?

69
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,231
I was Googling that girl
I've been dating,

70
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,438
and I found her blog.

71
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:58,548
Cool.

72
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,705
Anything juicy?

73
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:03,526
She said she recently went on a
date with a guy named Roger?

74
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,663
And he's Indian?

75
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,095
And he's an astrophysicist, too?

76
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,768
You know what's going on,
don't you?

77
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,882
Yes. Mummy was right.

78
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:19,024
American girls are
sexually voracious devils.

79
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:21,576
I can't believe
I have to explain this.

80
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:25,139
People change names on blogs
to protect their privacy.

81
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:27,881
Roger is Raj.

82
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,222
Oh.

83
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,877
I always thought, if I had a
white name, it would be Gavin.

84
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,614
Keep reading.
What does it say?

85
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,261
No, no, I don't know
if I should.

86
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,630
If she wanted me to know about
her blog, she would've told me.

87
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,422
It's almost like
I'm reading her diary.

88
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:45,036
That's exactly what it's like.
Keep reading.

89
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,157
No, this is creepy.

90
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,664
Oh, I think we were looking
at creepy in the rearview mirror

91
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,845
when I put up that camera.

92
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:56,494
It's not creepy.
Don't listen to him.

93
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:01,233
Oh, look who's got
the sweetest kisses.

94
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,206
Should I go?

95
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,862
With all the TV Sheldon
was talking about,

96
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,680
I had the greatest idea ever.

97
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,071
It even blows away my idea for a <i>Star Wars
</i> themed coffee shop called "Brewbacca's."

98
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:28,424
You need to watch
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</i>

99
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,171
It is the perfect show
for the two of us.

100
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,665
It's got action and jokes

101
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,488
and hot vampires and romance.
I cannot oversell this!

102
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,084
What do you say?

103
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,766
It's 6:30 in the morning.

104
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:43,307
I thought you
grew up on a farm.

105
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,319
Hello, SyFy Network?

106
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,517
Yeah, this is your
vice president of programming.

107
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:55,314
Now, we have made a horrible
mistake regarding <i>Alphas.</i>

108
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:58,118
Yeah, we need to uncancel it
immediately.

109
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,665
Well, you just put me through
to the people who handle that,

110
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,809
you tell them it's me,

111
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,520
and I don't want to answer
a lot of questions

112
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:06,334
about if I really am
who I say I am, you know?

113
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,700
I just... I want this done.

114
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:12,133
No, I am not the person
who just called.

115
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,990
That man was clearly a cowboy.

116
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:20,139
Yeah, who was plumb concerned about
y'all canceling his favorite show.

117
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,319
Why do they keep
hanging up on me?

118
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,913
I'm sorry you're upset.

119
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,444
You know, Sheldon,

120
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,433
sometimes
people seek the comfort

121
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,363
of physical contact
in moments like this.

122
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:38,490
I am not flying back to Texas

123
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:41,326
just so my mom
can give me a hug.

124
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:43,957
Okay.

125
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,933
Well, what I think
is going on here

126
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:48,814
is you have a pathological
need for closure.

127
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,885
Oh, that's nonsense.

128
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,799
I mean, you tell me stories
about your day all the time.

129
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,531
I don't care how they end.

130
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,786
You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

131
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,076
There's a whole field
of behavioral neuroscience

132
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,859
that examines ways to retrain
your neural pathways

133
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,999
so stuff like this
bothers you less.

134
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,211
Yeah, but I just told you, I don't
have a problem with closure.

135
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:11,619
You sure about that?

136
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,106
Oh, quite sure.

137
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:26,773
That proves nothing.

138
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,636
Ready to go to lunch?

139
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,644
Do you think I'm feminine?

140
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,728
Yeah. Let's go.

141
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,687
- Thanks a lot.
- What's going on?

142
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,752
I broke down,
and I read Lucy's blog.

143
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:44,211
And in one of the entries,
she said, when we first met,

144
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,295
I struck her
as a little feminine.

145
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,064
Just a little?
That's great.

146
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,556
I have to talk to her
about this.

147
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,117
Oh, geez, why do you girls

148
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:55,108
always want to talk
about things?

149
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,309
Listen to me, if she's writing
about your relationship,

150
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,050
use it to your advantage.

151
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,662
Rig the game.

152
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,107
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

153
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,604
Is it fair that girls
like confident, normal guys

154
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,918
more than nervous weirdos?

155
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,984
No, it's not. I've always
thought that was unfair.

156
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,505
So take what's in that blog

157
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,830
and use it to get
her pants off.

158
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,018
Why do you have to make
everything so filthy?

159
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,899
Why couldn't you just say
the blog is like

160
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,125
her giving me
the key to her heart?

161
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,344
"The key to her heart."

162
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,532
That's nice.

163
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:28,806
Were you quoting someone or is it
tattooed on the small of your back?

164
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,174
I was quoting a man

165
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,448
who knows a thing or two
about women:

166
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,712
Sir Elton John.

167
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:45,601
So, did you love it?

168
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,889
Of course you loved it. How could you not
love it? Tell me how much you loved it.

169
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,351
It was cute.

170
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,032
Oh, don't say cute.

171
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:57,096
- That's the worst.
- W's wrong with cute?

172
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,414
It just makes things seem small.

173
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,030
It diminishes them.

174
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,531
So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

175
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,458
You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

176
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,111
I just... I don't understand how
you can watch a show that great

177
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,736
and not be excited by it.

178
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,223
I liked it. I'm excited.

179
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:17,494
Well, then, tell your face.

180
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,249
What do you want from me?

181
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:21,421
You know what?

182
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:22,639
Never mind.
We gave it a shot.

183
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,039
Let's just see what else is on.

184
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,112
Oh, come on,
don't be like that.

185
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,331
- Well...
- I'm sorry I called it cute.

186
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,157
Let's watch another one.
Really?

187
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,306
Yeah, it was fun.

188
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,197
Kind of reminded me
of my high school.

189
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,677
But instead of vampires,
we had meth heads.

190
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,875
But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

191
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,020
All right, cool. I-I think
you'll like the next one better.

192
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:46,612
All the cheerleaders are
suffering from an evil curse.

193
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:49,336
Oh. Well, that's like
my high school, too.

194
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,786
But instead of a curse,
it was crabs.

195
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:57,299
I've come up with
a series of exercises

196
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,737
to help with your
compulsive need for closure.

197
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,003
I take issue with
the word "compulsive."

198
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:05,403
All I'm saying is,

199
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:09,120
we live in a world where
closure isn't always an op...

200
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,554
...tion. Okay.

201
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:27,017
For the sake of argument,
let's say I have a problem.

202
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,327
What would be your plan
for addressing it?

203
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,647
I'm going to recondition
your brain

204
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:36,308
so that the need for completion
isn't so overwhelming.

205
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,767
By playing tic-tac-toe?

206
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:41,461
Yep. Your turn.

207
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:43,420
Oh, Amy.

208
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:45,458
And you wonder why people
think neuroscience

209
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:48,287
is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

210
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:52,890
Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw...

211
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:55,663
none of which will
deny me closure.

212
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,462
Especially since
I'm about to win.

213
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,896
B-But we didn't finish.

214
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,103
Exactly.

215
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,868
How does that make you feel?

216
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,980
The same way any
normal person would.

217
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,147
Feel like I want to
peel off my own face

218
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,952
and tear it in two
and then again and again

219
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,755
until I have a handful
of Sheldon-face confetti.

220
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,558
And that's exactly the feeling we want to
address with this course of treatment.

221
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,505
Yeah, or you could pitch in,
grab a nostril

222
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:32,763
and help me get this face off.

223
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,703
Come on, you can do this.

224
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,381
You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

225
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:38,853
To have a-a desire

226
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,668
build up within you
and be denied

227
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:43,362
any opportunity for release.

228
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,897
Yeah, sounds like a drag.

229
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,630
Okay, help me out here.

230
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,848
Why does he love
this show so much?

231
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,670
Well, there was action,
it was funny.

232
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,035
I mean, you do get

233
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,543
that usually the monster
chases the pretty girl,

234
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:16,624
but this time the pretty girl
chases the monsters?

235
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,769
Yippee, it's backwards.
I get it.

236
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,338
Why does this
bother you so much?

237
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,672
I don't know.

238
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:28,195
It's just, he's so passionate
about so many different things.

239
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,637
I just don't get that way.

240
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,900
Do you?

241
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,893
Well, sure. I'm pretty
passionate about science.

242
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,898
I remember the first time
I looked through a microscope

243
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,444
and saw millions
of tiny microorganisms.

244
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,630
It was like
a whole other universe.

245
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:45,150
If I wanted to, I could wipe
it out with my thumb like a god.

246
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,237
See? I wish I had some
of that fire in my life.

247
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,040
I mean, I want
to care about things

248
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,668
and get excited like you guys.

249
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,420
Well, there's no
reason you can't.

250
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:55,292
You think?

251
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:57,481
Absolutely.
All we need to do is spend

252
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,363
a little time and find something
you're passionate about.

253
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,852
That sounds like a lot of work.

254
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,392
Hey, what's up?

255
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,717
Uh, Lucy's coming over.
I need some advice.

256
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,321
However long you think
the foreplay should be,

257
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:16,158
triple it.

258
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,032
Just tell me which one you think
is more manly.

259
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,596
This hockey jersey or...

260
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:25,662
this football jersey.

261
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,558
I don't know. Go with hockey.

262
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:29,752
Good--

263
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,777
black is more slimming.

264
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:34,447
Oh, that's her.

265
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,001
I got to go be butch.
Toodles.

266
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:42,973
Hey.
Hi.

267
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,585
Come in.

268
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,903
Oh, look how cute
your little doggy is.

269
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:49,751
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't get too close.

270
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,062
If I give the right command in
German, she'll rip your face off.

271
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:02,055
♪ O'er the land of the free ♪

272
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,417
♪ And the home ♪

273
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:07,134
♪ Of the... ♪

274
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,961
Next.

275
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,216
That's quite an impressive
layout, isn't it?

276
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,824
Yes.

277
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,065
Let's box it up.

278
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,941
"Let's box it up."

279
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,215
That's enough.

280
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,280
Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!

281
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,825
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish
and blow out the candles.

282
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,413
Oops, missed one.

283
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:57,522
Now your wish can't come true.

284
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,715
Lucky for you,
'cause I wished you were dead.

285
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,058
I like your jersey.

286
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,973
Thanks. I love hockey.

287
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,688
Oh, cool. So does my dad.

288
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,688
We watched it
all the time growing up.

289
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,456
Who's your favorite player?

290
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:23,542
Not Brian Boitano,
that's for sure.

291
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:26,824
How's your burrito?

292
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,672
It's still a little frozen
in the middle.

293
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,635
Probably because I didn't
read the instructions.

294
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:33,405
No wrapper's
going to tell me what to do.

295
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:36,058
Unless his name is Jay-Z.

296
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,732
Is something going on?

297
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,765
What do you mean?

298
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,476
Well, you're acting all weird.

299
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,188
And I'm pretty weird, so I think
I know what I'm talking about.

300
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:49,391
I don't know. Maybe it's all
those steroids I've been taking.

301
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,766
I think I'm gonna go.

302
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,356
Thank you for the burrito and the
pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture

303
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,768
on why monster trucks
are better than regular trucks.

304
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,148
Wait, wait.

305
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:05,633
I-I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

306
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,470
Oh. I kind of just write that
for myself.

307
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,143
I didn't think anybody
actually read it.

308
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,001
No kidding. You didn't
make it easy to find.

309
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,722
I spent hours
digging around online.

310
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,688
For the record, you have
excellent credit scores.

311
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,363
And your diabetic aunt seems

312
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,960
to be adjusting
to her new leg just fine.

313
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,491
Why were you acting
so strange tonight?

314
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,876
You called me feminine.

315
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,055
And I...

316
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,613
I wanted you to think
I was more manly.

317
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:35,411
Raj, I didn't say "feminine"
was a bad thing.

318
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,439
I meant that you're sweet
and thoughtful

319
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,153
and your skin looks
so much like caramel,

320
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,866
I just want to dip
an apple in your face.

321
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,486
I do have a pretty
balls-to-the-wall

322
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:46,689
moisturizing regimen.

323
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:49,702
So, are you okay?

324
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:51,085
Yeah.

325
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,648
Good.

326
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,416
Do you even like hockey?

327
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,857
No.

328
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:59,064
Bought this at the Staples Center
when I went to see Taylor Swift.

329
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,049
So, I was thinking
how excited you get

330
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,654
about stuff like <i>Buffy</i>
or science

331
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:10,072
or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy.

332
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:11,724
The "Harmony One" was fine.

333
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,326
We didn't need to upgrade
to the 1100,

334
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:16,429
which he knows
is too big for my hand.

335
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:20,442
See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think I had.

336
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:23,326
But then I realized
I'm passionate about you.

337
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,031
Oh...

338
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,454
my cute little tushy
strikes again.

339
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:30,864
No, I'm serious.

340
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:32,667
Look, I've always had
these plans.

341
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,168
I was gonna be in movies
and live this glamorous life,

342
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,397
and anything less than that just
wasn't worth getting excited about.

343
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,222
Those things can still happen.

344
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,469
Oh, obviously it's gonna happen.

345
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,158
Yeah, a psychic at a
bachelorette party told me so.

346
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,805
Anyway, what I meant was...

347
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,086
I shouldn't wait, you know?

348
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:54,400
I've got you, I've got Sheldon,
all these wonderful friends.

349
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,200
My life is exciting right now.

350
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,765
That's a big deal.

351
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,719
It is, isn't it?

352
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,013
So, does that mean
we get to do stuff

353
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,414
like talk about cool shows
or get dressed up

354
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:12,017
in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

355
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:16,539
Leonard, I had an
epiphany, not a stroke.

356
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:23,205
Amy, I must say,
I was skeptical at first,

357
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,328
but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

358
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,994
I'm a little surprised to hear
you feeling so positive.

359
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,442
Well, you're an excellent
neuroscientist,

360
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:34,928
you're a wonderful
girlfriend, and...

361
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,186
And?

362
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,151
Doesn't matter, does it?

363
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,325
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

364
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:50,342
And a complete sucker.

365
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,912
Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:06,069
There he is.

367
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:13,560
♪ And the home of the brave... ♪

368
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,979
Don't stop. Yes, keep going.

369
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,956
Just like that.
Almost there, almost there.

370
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,135
Sheldon, you big weirdo,

371
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,324
I want you to know that I love
that you're in my life.

372
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,004
I love you, too.

373
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,535
Hello. Uh, is this
the Bruce Miller who wrote

374
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,126
the season finale of <i>Alphas?</i>

375
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,837
Oh, smashing.
Yeah, you already sound nicer

376
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:56,185
than the last Bruce Miller who suggested
I have sexual relations with myself.

377
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:57,725
Yeah, now, down to business.

378
00:18:57,743 --> 00:18:59,927
Um, your show ended
on a cliffhanger.

379
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:03,039
Could you please tell me
how you planned to resolve it?

380
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,941
Uh-huh.

381
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,695
Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,701
I see.

383
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:10,522
Well, that all stinks.

384
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,856
No wonder you got canceled.
Bye.

385
