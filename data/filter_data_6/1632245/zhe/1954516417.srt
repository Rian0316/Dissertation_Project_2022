1
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,930
Okay, help me out here.

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,600
How does an archeology professor get that good with a whip?

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,770
That's how I learned.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,580
I can't believe you've never seen  Raiders of the Lost Ark.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,580

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,350
And I can't believe you've never read  Eat, Pray, Love.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,350

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,980
When she comes out with

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,580
Eat, Pray, Run Away From A   Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,450
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,660
I'm not reading it.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,690
You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,460
That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,530
Deborah Nadoolman.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,870
She also designed

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,270
the iconic red and black jacket

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,070
in Michael Jackson's Thriller video,

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,070
which I've never viewed in its entirety,

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,510
as I find zombies dancing

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,910
in choreographed synchronicity implausible.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,350
And also, it's really scary.

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,450
Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,190
There's no switch. Just listen and learn.

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,750
Penny, if you think this is good,

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,220
you should come with us Friday

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,090
to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,090

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,390
Well, I'm watching it now.

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,860
Why would I want to see it again on Friday?

32
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,700
Because the print they're showing on Friday

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,840
What? 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,870
Exactly.

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,640
They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
Did-- Leonard?

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm no expert, but I believe

39
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,280
what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,150
Oh! Good.

41
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm 8 for 26 this month.

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,520
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,460
But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

44
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,890
Bet if I could make you understand

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,160
why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,660
Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.

47
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,070
Uh-huh.

48
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,040
May I point out to you all

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,340
that the screening is "first come, first served"?

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,940
Relax, it's 5:00. The movie doesn't start till midnight.

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,310
Another way of saying that is

53
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,380
"the movie starts at midnight, and it's already 5:00."

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,920
Let's go.

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of

56
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,290
listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,120
See? Howard's on my side.

58
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,830
Actually, I'm not.

59
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,670
Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

61
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,700
Don't worry, Sheldon.We'll be fine.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,670
What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,110
who waited in line with me for 14 hours

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,310
to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?

65
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,110
Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours,

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,710
while you napped in a lawn chair,

67
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,380
he got in a fight with a Klingon

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
when he stepped out of line to pee

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,880
and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him,

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,250
and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,390
But how were our seats?

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,460
Excellent.

73
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,060
I rest my case.

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,500
Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,170
Actually, as the newest member of your social group,

76
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,370
I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily

77
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,670
siding with your friends from time to time.

78
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,670
Shrewd.

79
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,280
Leonard, you're right.

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late,

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,950
and risk winding up with terrible seats,

82
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,010
assuming we get in at all.

83
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,720
Thank you, Amy.

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,320
See? It's working.

85
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,290
Knock-knock.

86
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,420
Who's there?

87
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Olive.[I love u]

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,390
Olive you, too.

89
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,730
Guys, that's really starting to get old.

90
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,860
Knock-knock.

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,970
Who's there?

92
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,800
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,870
Hysterical!

94
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,110
Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished.

95
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,910
I have a girlfriend and you don't who?

96
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,110
So. Are you sure you don't want to come with us to Raiders?

97
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,120
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,750
It reminds me too much of the time

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,750
I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria

100
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,020
into the Rhesus monkey lab.

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,060
Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight.

102
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,230
Girls' night?  What does that entail?

103
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,830
Oh, you know, girls get together,

104
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,360
hang out, share girl talk.

105
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm a girl.

106
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,970
Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I'll ask Penny.

107
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,910
No need. Penny and I are very close.

108
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,610
You are?

109
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,150
Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized.

110
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,220
Penny.

111
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,150
Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.

112
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,090
I'm a girl.

113
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,760
Oh. Um, it was -- it was just going to be me and Bernadette.

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,630
Besides, I thought you were going to the movies

115
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,700
with Sheldon and the guys.

116
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,070
Yes, but they're not girls.

117
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,270
I'm a girl.

118
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,340
Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,840
What's the dress code?

120
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,780
Uh, just wear something comfortable.

121
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,580
All right. I'll have to go shopping.

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Knock-knock.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,620
Who is there?

124
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,220
- Hugh.  - Hugh who?

125
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,920
Hugh people need to listen to me.

126
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,530
It's time to get in line for the movie.

127
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,960
And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,810
Under normal circumstances I'd say, "I told you so".

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,010
But as I have told you so

130
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,540
with such vehemence and frequency already,

131
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,610
the phrase has lost all meaning.

132
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,250
Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase:

133
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,620
"I informed you thusly".

134
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,390
Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.

135
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,690
I informed you thusly.

136
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,190
8 for 28.

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,090
This is where we could have been

138
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,060
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

139
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,230
This is where we could have been

140
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,600
if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,670
Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.

142
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,840
And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter.

143
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,510
Unlikely to ever reach

144
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,550
the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

145
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,420
So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.

146
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,390
You know, guys, when facing disappointment,

147
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,590
Eat, Pray, Loveteaches us --

148
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,160
Oh, shut up.

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,930
...So anyway, to make a long story short,

150
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,500
turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.

151
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,870
You know -- Amy, when we say "girl talk",

152
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,780
it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,660
Shame. 'Cause I have a real zinger

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,580
about my tilted uterus.

155
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,790
Penny, your nails look great.

156
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,960
Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra.

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,430
It's in a woman's basement.

158
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,830
I think it's a front for human trafficking,

159
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,700
but they do a really good job.

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,730
A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus

161
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,500
that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements.

162
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,440
Well don't tell me that's not "girl talk".

163
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
So where should we go tonight?

164
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,580
A bar? A club? A movie?

165
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,210
Or we could just stay here.

166
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,820
Yes, a continue to bond.

167
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,520
I have a feeling that after tonight,

168
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,020
one of you will become my best friend forever.

169
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,060
Or "BFF," if you prefer.

170
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,420
Which I don't.

171
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,730
All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.

172
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,130
Gee, I don't know if I should drink more.

173
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,330
I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble

174
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,070
seeing over the dashboard as it is.

175
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,410
That's okay. You can just sleep here.

176
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,740
Oh, good, a slumber party!

177
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,080
We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls,

178
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,050
and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!

179
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,580
Oh, gosh, Amy.

180
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,050
I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.

181
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,590
Well, that's disappointing.

182
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,190
I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.

183
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,690
Oh, you never were?

184
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,190
Not even when you were a kid?

185
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,730
Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out,

186
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,160
and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl.

187
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,970
She didn't make it through the night,

188
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,170
but up till then, it was kind of fun.

189
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,710
Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party.

190
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,740
Pillow fight!

191
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,320
Oh, I hope they let us in soon.

192
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom.

193
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,020
The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time.

194
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,460
It's a vicious circle.

195
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.

196
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,830
What's a stadium pal?

197
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,460
Let me put it this way:

198
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,270
takes care of the bathroom problem,

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,800
and it keeps your calf warm.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,340
Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation.

201
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,810
Given the size of the theater and the length of this line,

202
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,510
we might not get seats.

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,810
What did he say?

204
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,050
Nice going, Raj.

205
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,850
Just got him down for his nap.

206
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,320
We might not get seats?!

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,990
It's fine, it's fine.Go back to sleep.

208
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,420
Oh, I informed you thusly! I so informed you thusly.

209
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,130
Howard, you talk to him.

210
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,430
Howard?

211
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,270
You're peeing, aren't you?

212
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,440
Hey, look who's here!

213
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,170
Hey, buddies!

214
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,770
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

215
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,810
the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.

216
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,450
(la Ja Ja Binks)Mee-sa think that very funny!

217
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,320
Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line.

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,690
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

219
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,360
Wil Wheaton.

220
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah.

221
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm a big fan.

222
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,660
Of what? Poorly executed beards?

223
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie?

224
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,930
We got here a little late.

225
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,730
No problem. Come on, I'll hook you up.

226
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,170
Awesome.

227
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,540
We-sa gonna go into the movie now! Bye-bye!

228
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,510
This is Indiana Jones,

229
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,410
not Star Trek.

230
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,350
There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here!

231
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,020
And even at Star Trek conventions,

232
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,950
they only let him in if he helps set up!

233
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,620
Calm down, Sheldon.

234
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,120
I will not calm down.

235
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,130
This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered.

236
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,890
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said,

237
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,960
"The line must be drawn here!

238
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,600
"This far, no farther!"

239
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,840
Had to wake him up from his nap, didn't you?

240
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,540
You know what I really love about Howard?

241
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,340
His chest hair.

242
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,010
Howard has a hairy chest?

243
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,010
No, just the one.

244
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,450
But it's really long.

245
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,690
Okay, there you go-- Sultry Sunrise Red.

246
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,290
What do you think?

247
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,030
My nails have never looked so pretty before.

248
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,990
Get it off.

249
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,230
Oh, oh, uh, looks like they're getting ready

250
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,230
to let people in.

251
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,340
Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting.

252
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,140
"Best seats in house for Raiders screening.

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,310
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

254
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,080
Why do you read his Twitter feed?

255
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,980
You know it's only going to upset you.

256
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,250
I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.

257
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,620
Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer

258
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,960
have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull?

259
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,960

260
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Would not Lee have followed Grant?

261
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,360

262
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,930
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

263
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,630
I have more examples, but excuse me.

264
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,300
Hello.

265
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,730
Well, this seems like an odd time

266
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,200
to test my cell phone quality, but go on.

267
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,470
Test phrases? All right.

268
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
Im a tote.

269
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,480
Ulba.

270
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,050
Twad.

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,780
All together?

272
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,090
I'm a total buttwad.

273
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,560
Why are you laughing?

274
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,960
Hello?

275
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,660
And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.

276
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,830
I'm not sure I grasp

277
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,170
the full entertainment value, but all right.

278
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,800
Next on Wikipedia's list of slumber party activities:

279
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,170
"Truth or Dare."

280
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,770
Okay, it's your game. You go first.

281
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,240
Hang on. I'm familiarizing myself with the rules.

282
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,950
Seems fairly straightforward.

283
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,350
Bernadette, truth or dare?

284
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,920
- Truth. - All right.

285
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,420
To what temperature must you heat beef

286
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,990
in order to kill the prion

287
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,560
that cses bovinespongiform encephalopathy?

288
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,660
Um...

289
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,930
Remember, you have to answer honestly.

290
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,200
Wait. No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her

291
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,370
something personal or embarrassing.

292
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,970
Oh. All right.

293
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,940
What is the circumference of your areolas?

294
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
"Munching on complimentary popcorn.

295
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,820
Woot, woot."

296
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh, the gall.

297
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,990
I hope his next tweet is  "Popcorn lodged in trachea.

298
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,020
Choking to death.

299
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,790
Woot, woot."

300
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,160
Guys, I am sorry.We are full up.

301
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,500
No!

302
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,430
We're full up.

303
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,230
We really want to see this.

304
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,930
Isn't there anythingyou can do?

305
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,540
Sorry. Fire regulations.

306
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,740
Should've gotten here earlier.

307
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,510
This is nothing but ablatant abuse of power

308
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,240
by a petty functionary.

309
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

310
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,310
get in and we don't.

311
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,050
'Cause I'm the petty functionary with a clipboard, bitch.

312
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,020
I guess that's that.

313
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,890
Let's go home.

314
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,520
You know what? I'm going back to "I told you so."

315
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,590
I told you so.

316
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,660
We can still see something.

317
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,200
Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away.

318
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,670
You know Sandy B. always brings it.

319
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,100
Look-- a side door.

320
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,470
Come on, Short Round.

321
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,670
I guess we'd bettergo after him.

322
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,110
Short Round?

323
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,910
Indy's young sidekick from Temple of Doom.

324
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,910

325
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,280
Yeah, I know who itis, but why is it me?

326
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,520
You're right. It shouldbe a cuddly Asian boy.

327
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,480
Like me.

328
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,250
"And Absalom has kissed her nether eye,

329
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,320
"And Nicholas is branded on the butt.

330
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,030
This tale is done, and God save all the rout."

331
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,670
What the hell was that?

332
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,570
Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story.

333
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,840
"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know.

334
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,940
It would have been hidden in sock drawers

335
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,550
if people in the 14th century had worn socks.

336
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,020
I thought it was pretty spicy.

337
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,890
Especially the part where he kisses her nether eye.

338
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,520
You might not like it as much

339
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,220
if you knew what "nether eye" meant.

340
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,190
Hint: if one cares about hygiene,

341
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,530
one ought not be kissing it.

342
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,700
Okay, my turn.

343
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
Penny, truth or dare?

344
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,570
Truth.

345
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,900
Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much

346
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,400
even though you broke up with him?

347
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,770
Oh, that's an excellent question.

348
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,080
For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded,

349
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,510
you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company.

350
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah.

351
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,220
Dare.

352
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,020
I don't believe the rules allow

353
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,890
for an ex post facto option change.

354
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,490
Yeah.

355
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,190
Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore

356
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,930
doesn't meanwe can't be friends.

357
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,830
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

358
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,930
Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?

359
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,330
I don't know.

360
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,200
He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.

361
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,610
Interesting.

362
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,240
How will you react if, in the future,

363
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,380
you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable,

364
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,480
because another woman has realized that he is--

365
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,650
to use your words--"a great guy"?

366
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,950
You can only ask one question.

367
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,250
That one.

368
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,890
You know what,  I don't want to play anymore.

369
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,700
Well, I'm not sure how this is scored,

370
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
but I believe we may have won.

371
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,740
Sheldon?

372
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,380
Sheldon?

373
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,810
Where did he go?

374
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,820
We're looking for Sheldon,not Marmaduke.

375
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,060
You whistled?

376
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,390
What is that?

377
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,930
Raiders of the Lost Ark

378
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,730
with 21 additional seconds.

379
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
If I can't see it, no one else can see it.

380
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,870
Sheldon, this is crazy.

381
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,570
No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.

382
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,070
Listen to me.

383
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,440
You are over-tired. You're not thinking right.

384
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
Put the movie back before we get into trouble.

385
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,940
Trouble is my middle name,Leonard.

386
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,710
Actually, it's Lee,but I prefer Trouble.

387
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,180
Oh, look who they let in.

388
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,090
Don't worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.

389
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,190

390
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,630
Come on, Short Round.

391
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,300
Yeah.

392
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,000
Come on, guys!Hurry up! Hurry up!

393
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,540
Let's see you run with a bag of urines trapped to your leg.

394
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,110

395
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,110
He's got the movie! Get him!

396
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,480
Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?

397
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,100
She's been in there a long time.

398
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,970
Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her.

399
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,940
Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it

400
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,910
with anothor popular slumber party activity.

401
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,010
- Ooh, like what? - Well, the Internet suggests

402
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,380
that slumber party guests often engage

403
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,450
in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.

404
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,420
Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?

405
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,030
- Penny?  - Oh, hey, Amy.

406
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,160
Look, I'm sorry I got so upset. I just...

407
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,530
What are you doing?

408
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,040
Don't worry. I'll avoid the nether eye.

409
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,870
I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
