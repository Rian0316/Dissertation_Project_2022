我结算了小蛋糕店的收银机
Oh, I closed out the cupcake register.

31
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,490
这是挣来的房租钱
Here's our rent money.

32
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,490
钱拿去  信封袋还我
Gimme back the envelope though,

33
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,400
那袋子也是我的珠宝首饰盒
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

34
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,210
我也结算了收银机
I closed out the register.

35
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,580
我这也有一份交房租的钱
I have our rent money.

36
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,850
麦克斯  你知道这代表什么吗
Max, do you know what this means?

37
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,100
如果我脑子没有被驴踢了
Unless I was hit in the head by a piece of farm equipment,

38
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,670
就表示咱们有盈余啦
it means we have extra money.

39
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,970
我好想来一段盈余庆祝舞
I wanna do the extra money dance,

40
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,850
但我们没有这一套舞  
but we don't have one

41
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,780
因为我们的钱从没有过盈余
because we've never had extra money!

42
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,550
我唯一会的挣钱[盈余]舞  
The only extra money dance I know

43
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,740
需要用到乒乓球
involves ping-pong balls

44
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,600
又名"十八招"  常由东南亚女性表演
由下阴"吞入""喷吐"乒乓球的成人表演

45
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,600
而我也久没跳  技艺生疏了
and I'm really out of practice.

46
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,670
厄尔  我给你带来了你的最爱
Earl, I brought you your favorite.

47
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,420
黑人华人混血肚皮舞女吗

你看卡洛琳
Look at Caroline over there.

50
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,190
使出浑身解数跟人调情
She's flirting harder with him

51
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,400
比我对抗心脏病还卖力
than I flirt with heart disease.

52
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,260
不许  不许说
Stop, stop!

53
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,390
人家才看到第一季第二集
I'm only on episode two of season one.

54
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,630

57
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,720
好呀  那我们下回分晓时
Well, then, we will continue this

58
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,490
再来下回分晓吧
when we continue this.

59
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
如果你尽全力就这程度
If that's your game,

60
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,130
那估计你这辈子都得跟姐住了  妹子
you're gonna be living with me forever, fran.

61
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,950
他已经连续叁晚来我这区
He's been in my section three nights in a row

62
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,020
点火鸡肉叁明治了
for the turkey club.

63
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,040
我叫他"火鸡叁明治帅哥"
I'm calling him "the turkey club cutie".

64
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,280
听得我想"叫救命"
I'm calling poison control.

65
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,910
我看他应该差不多要约我了
I think he's getting ready to ask me out.

66
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,330
他问我是不是住在附近
He wanted to know if I live around here

67
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,690
还问我几点下班
and what time I get off.

68
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,650
一个愿意等到你下班[高潮]的男人
If a man's gonna wait for you to get off,

69
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,220
绝对要留住啊
he's a keeper.

70
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,830
那就...
So...

71

那我们就下次见啦
I will see you next time as well.

73
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,330
再见
Bye.

74
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,720
-那是什么  -不知道  我哪会知道
- What's that? - I don't know. How would I know?

75
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,160
因为是你头上掉下来的啊
Because it came out of your head.

76
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,720
麦克斯  我才没有去接发
I don't have hair extensions, Max.

77
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
好吧  那我拿去扔了
Okay, I'll throw it out.

78
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,490
别  下次能当故事说
No! I'll keep it for this story!

79
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,780
什么故事
What story?

80
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,380
某天晚上我们
The story about how we found

81
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,870
无缘无故发现一段金色接发的故事
a blonde hair extension out of nowhere that night.

82
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
超好笑啊
It's hilarious!

83
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,930
是比你大多数故事都好笑了
Well, it's already funnier than most of your stories.

84
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,060
你看  又一段"爆笑故事"
Oh, look, there's another hilarious story!

85
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,510
好啦  麦克斯  我得坦白件事
Okay, Max, I have a confession to make.

86
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,060
我有做过接发
I have hair extensions.

87
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,520
我也有件事想坦白
I also have a confession to make.

88
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,820
我在罗德岛杀过人
I murdered a man in Rhode island.

89
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,100
我就接了几段  让头发有点层次
I just have a few. It gives me volume.

90
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,460
可惜它不能让你有点深度
Too bad it doesn't give you depth.

91
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,920
我现在得想办法把它们重新接上
Now I have to go and try and reattach these.

92
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,870
这接发不应该这么容易掉啊
These weaves are supposed to last.

93
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,340
我真不敢"接"信会这样
This is unbe-weave-able!

94
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,340
我在生菜里发现了这个
I found this in the lettuce.

95
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,080
里面有发现阴道避孕环吗
Any sign of a nuva ring in there?

96
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,010
因为我的不见了
'Cause I can't find mine.

97
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,120
是卡洛琳在掉头发吧
Caroline's losing her hair, isn't she?

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,090
她是不是生病了
Is she sick?

99
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,490
她是不是得了癌    得了大"C"[癌]
Does she have cancer, the big "C"?

100
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,370
才不是  小东西
No, little you.

101
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
她没有"大C"  
She doesn't have the big "C".

102
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,770
她连"AA"罩杯都没有
She barely has the double "A"s.

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,650
阿憨发现了你的头发
Han found more of your hair.

104
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,380
他知道我接发的事了吗
He knows about the extensions?

105
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,570
没  他以为你得了癌  
No, he thinks you have cancer.

106
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,060
那就好  没人知道就好
Oh, good! So no one knows.

107
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,370
安安  姑娘们  今夜因我而性感啦
Hola, ladies! Your night just got sexier.

108
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,590
路易斯  你早就下班了
Luis, you punched out hours ago.

109
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,960
你这么晚还来餐厅干嘛
What are you doing here so late?

110
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,740
回基[家]的路上吗
On your way homo?

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,830
牙尖嘴利呀  小贱人
Good one, hooker!

112
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,280
我在夜店跑摊
No, I'm between clubs.

113
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,100
马戏夜店现在是直男吧了
Circus just became a straight club,

114
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,300
卫星夜店还得再等半小时  才会变成基吧
And satellite doesn't become a gay club for a half hour.

115
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,090
所以就来跟我兄弟奥列格喝杯鸡尾酒啦
So...I'm here to have a cocktail with my bro Oleg.

116
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,550
路易斯  跟你说过他是直男了
Luis, we told you. Oleg is straight.

117
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,200
拜托  我在阿拉巴马州也是直男
Oh, please! So am I in Alabama.

118
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,200
阿拉巴马州反对同性恋
学校老师必须教导学生同性恋是违法的

119
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,070
他已经走了
Well, he left already.

120
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,990
我都跟他说我会来坐坐了
But I told him I was gonna stop by.

121
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,940
男人都这样  惧怕亲密感情
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

122
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,250
卡洛琳儿  趁我过来
Oh, Carolina, while I'm here...

123
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,640
顺便把我上班发现的东西还你
This is yours. I found it during my shift.

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,510
我没拿走的小费吗
Ooh, tips from my tables?

125
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,890
是你没收好的头发
More like hair from your head.

126
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,320
我就知道你那头秀发不可能是真的
I knew this was all too good to be true.

127
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,110
你做了接发
You have extensions.

128
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,600
不是  我是得了癌  
No, I have cancer.

129
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,470
屁咧  你做了接发  少唬我
No, you have extensions. Good try.

130
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,950
回见
Later!

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,550
看出我有何改变吗
Hey. Notice anything different?

132
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,390
我用小店盈余去弄了新接发
I took some of the extra money and got new hair extensions.

133
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,590
我还给你准备了份礼物  放你房里了
And I also got you a surprise. I put it in your room.

134
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,590
去看看
Go look!

135
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,860
我感兴趣的只有大肚猪
I'm not interested unless it's a potbelly pig

136
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,670
打扮成早期移民的大肚猪
or a potbelly pig in a pilgrim costume,

137
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,360
或打扮成大肚猪的早期移民
or a pilgrim in a potbelly pig costume,

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,790
或大麻[肚]
or just pot.

139
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,220
提示  我放在你床上哦
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.

140
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,120
觉得如何  爱不爱啊
What do you think? Do you love?

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,920
为啥这坨屎会在我床上
Okay... why is all this crap on my bed?

142
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,320
这他妈是什么玩意啊
And what the hell is it?

143
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,740
这是床裙啊
That's a bed skirt.

144
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,480
我的床才不要穿裙子  它是大老爷们
My bed doesn't wear skirts. It's a dude!

145
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,820
看它在我睡觉时从背后顶我  就知道是爷们 
I know, because it pokes me in the back while I'm asleep.

146
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,660
我帮你买了新寝具
I got you new bedding,

147
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,720
帮自己买了套新法兰绒睡衣
and me some cute new flannel jammies.

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
上面还有埃菲尔铁塔的图案
They have eiffel towers on them.

149
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,750
大家都讨厌法国人  所以这衣服超便宜的
They were marked down because everybody hates French people.

150
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,810
这上面连"污渍"都没有
These don't even have stains!

151
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,230
这样我怎么知道哪边是上面
How am I gonna know which is the top now?

152
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,540
麦克斯  这有啥不好
Max, what's the problem?

153
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,000
你的旧床单都用多久了
You've had those old sheets forever.

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,870
你连替换的都没有
You don't even have a spare set.

155
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,960
替换的床单
A spare set of sheets?

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,270
你当我谁啊  英国女皇吗
Who am I, the queen of England?

157
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,820
你真没劲  气得我都想扯头发了
You're so frustrating, I'd pull my hair out...

158
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,100
但我怕不小心扯到接发
But I'm not sure which of it is mine.

159
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,480
你看  这下你高兴了吗
Look! Look! Are you happy?

160
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,900
栗宝都不开心了  他知道我们吵架
Chestnut's upset. He knows we're fighting.

161
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,790
很好  
Good!

162
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,890
是该让他知道哪天他出门买包薯片
He should know that if he goes out for a bag of chips,

163
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,810
很可能一回来
he could come home to find

164
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,270
就发现他的马鞍被换成丁字裤了
you replaced his saddle with a thong.

165
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
我可是送你礼物呢
I got you a present.

166
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,670
你会气  诞老人吗
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus?

167
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,630
他是谁啊
Who's that?

168
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,100
求你了  麦克斯
Max, please.

169
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,980
做点改变  睡在好寝具上面嘛
Just for a change, try sleeping on something nice.

170
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,330
行
Fine!

171
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,010
但我要真想睡在好寝具上面
But if I wanted to sleep on something nice,

172
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,080
我就跟那个搬回家照顾
I would have hooked up with that guy

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,030
生病老母亲的男人走就好了
who moved home to take care of his sick mother.

174
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,380
小心提防啊  栗宝
Watch your back, Chestnut.

175
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,390
防火防盗防小人
Watch your back.

176
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,620
你个贱人  我的旧寝具呢
Where are my old sheets, bitch?

177
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
为什么
Why?

178
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,690
为什么要大半夜骂我贱人
Why are you calling me a "bitch" at night?

179
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,100
人家穿着新睡衣睡觉呢
I was sleeping in my new jammies.

180
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,830
没我的旧寝具我睡不着
Well, I can't sleep without those sheets.

181
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,240
你所有抽屉我都看过了  你藏哪去了
So where are they? I checked all your drawers.

182
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,030
对了
And by the way,

183
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,280
谁会把电动棒收星巴克杯子里啊
Who hides their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

184
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,780
明知故问  我继续睡觉了
You already know the answer, so I'm going back to sleep.

185
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,500
为什么呀
Why!

186
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,890
为什么穿着新睡衣的我会在地上
Why am I on the floor in my new jammies?

187
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,480
到底放哪去了
Where are they?

188
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,010
不在我这  我送给穷人了
I don't have them. I gave them to the poor.

189
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,470
你从穷人那里偷过去的
You took them from the poor!

190
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,370
现在穷人想讨回来
And the poor wants them back.

191
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,390
已经迟了
Well, it's too late.

192
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,950
我放到救世军的慈善捐助箱了
I put them in the Salvation Army donation bin.

193
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,810
那起来  你得去军中一趟了  贱妇
Well, get up. You're going to the army, bitch.

194
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,610
为什么呀
Whyyyy?

195
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,260
为什么我们大半夜得跑来这里
Why are we here in the middle of the night?

196
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,760
我们要干嘛
What are we doing?

197
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
就在这了  跟我过来
Here it is. Come on, follow me.

198
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,410
麦克斯  你要在这杀我吗
Max, is this where you kill me?

199
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,960
我一直都知道会有这么一天
'Cause I always knew it was gonna happen,

200
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
但我不知何时会发生
I just didn't know when.

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,930
但这里很有那感觉啊
This feels right though.

202
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,440
我是应该宰了你
I should kill you.

203
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,120
那套寝具对我有很特别的意义好吗
Those sheets were really special to me, okay?

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,080
你在上面失去贞操的吗
Oh, did you lose your virginities on them?

205
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,960
我不在床上做爱  那是我吃饭的地方
I don't have sex in beds. That's where I eat.

206
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,050
卡洛琳  我有件事要坦白
Caroline, I have a confession.

207
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,680
-什么事  -你有接发
- What is it? - You have hair extensions.

208
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,400
好啦  我说  但你不许看我
Okay, I'll tell you, but look away.

209
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,470
重点是那个枕套  我小时候就开始用了
It's the pillowcase. I've had it since I was a kid.

210
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,300
它又软又有触感
It's like soft and nubby

211
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,550
还有边边  我可以摸
and it had this edge that I'd like...rub,

212
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,430
在倒霉的日子  也就是每一天
and it relaxed me when things were crappy,

213
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,230
都能让我放松
which was all the time.

214
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,410
我需要那个枕套才能睡着
I guess I still need that pillowcase to sleep or whatever.

215
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,300
麦克斯  你好可怜哦
Max, that's so sad.

216
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
当然可怜啊
Of course it's sad!

217
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,830
我有过欢乐童话故事吗
When has it ever been a happy tale?

218
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,180
好啦  我得爬进去
All right, I need to crawl in here.

219
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,150
麦克斯  你要爬进这脏箱子啊
Max, you're just gonna crawl into that dirty box?

220
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,550
我们都不知道这箱子有多脏
We don't know where that bin's been.

221
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,240
对了
By the way,

222
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,430
"脏箱子"[脏货]也是我当年在学校的绰号 
"dirty box" was my nickname in continuation school.

223
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,720
帮忙一下
I need help.

224
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,700
你是要我踩你背上  还是踩你的头
Would you rather I step on your back or your head?

225
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,330
想都别想  这么贵的头会给你踩吗
My head? Hardly. Not at these prices.

226
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,730
来吧  十根手指伸出来
Come on, gimme ten fingers.

227
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,280
给过了
I already did.

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
来的路上伸过十次中指
Behind your back while we were walking here.

229
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,050
是让你这样  我就能踩着上去
No, like this, so I can step into it.

230
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,570
就跟个手指篮子一样
You know, like a finger basket.

231
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,600
手指篮[装蛋蛋]
Finger basket?

232
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,100
那是你的另一个绰号吗
Is that another nickname of yours?

233
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,720
不是  但某年夏天本来可以的
No, but for one summer, it could've been.

234
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,870
那算了  来帮忙搬东西让我踩吧
Forget this, just let me pull this stuff over.

235
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,490
麦克斯  我觉得我们一直在突破下限
Max, I feel like we're not even acknowledging

236
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,350
下限都成路人了
our low points anymore.

237
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,570
麦克斯  千万小心
Okay, Max, now be very careful.

238
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,530
等我数到...
And on the count of...

239
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,240
你完全能当体操员啊
Wow! You could've been a great gymnast,

240
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,170
如果你有钱  有教练  做了缩胸手术的话
if you'd had money, coaches, and a breast reduction.

241
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,710
你没事吧
Are you okay?

242
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,400
麦克斯
Max?

243
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,540
发点声音出来啊
Gonna need some voice contact.

244
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,190
吾路不孤
I'm not in here alone.

245
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,910
你说吾路不孤是个什么意思
What do you mean you're not alone?

246
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,970
意思是  里面不只我一个人
I mean, I'm not in here alone.

247
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,160
别慌  我马上救你出来
Stay calm! I will get you out of there.

248
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,780
不  我做不到
No, I won't.

249
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,530
我在找打开门的把手
I'm looking for a lever on the inside.

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,250
滚出我家
Get outta my house!

251
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,840
我只是想看看你是不是压在我的枕套上
I just wanna check and see if you're on my pillowcase.

252
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
-别啊  麦克斯  -我要我亲爱的寝具
- Max, no! - I need my sweet sheets!

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,390
放弃吧
Let it go.

254
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,090
如果被他压在身下了  那也不亲不爱了
If your sheets are under there, they're no long sweet.

255
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,550
滚出我家
Get outta my house!

256
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,960
关上门
Close the door!

257
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,690
行行行
Okay! Okay!

258
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,100
真是的  咱俩也算睡过了  真无情
God, sheez. You'd think we'd slept together.

259
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,930
这下我得怎么办
What am I gonna do?

260
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,620
没那套寝具我就睡不着
I can't sleep without those sheets.

261
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,290
我恨死你了
I'm so angry at you!

262
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,010
要不是发现这件好奶罩  我会更气
I'd be even angrier if I hadn't found this great bra.

263
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,820
你想睡觉为啥还要来苏菲家
Why are you going to Sophie's if you're trying to sleep?

264
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,960
她是我们认识最大嗓门的人了
She's the loudest person we know.

265
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,100
电影院里爱喧哗的黑人都嫌她吵
Even black people at the movies tell Sophie to be quiet.

266
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,500
我来她家是想要个安眠药
I am going to Sophie's to get a sleeping pill.

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,060
也就是她口中的"晚安糖"
Or as she likes to call them, "night candy".

268
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,780
你不需要吃安眠药
You don't need a pill.

269
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,490
我有一招很棒的入眠方法
Listen, I have a great sleep technique

270
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,660
是我的睡眠教练教我的
that my sleep coach taught me.

271
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,610
我也跟一堆教练"睡"过
I have slept with my fair share of coaches,

272
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,480
他们的唯一用处就是让我不能睡
and if anything, they kept me awake.

273
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,090
麦克斯  凌晨叁点
Max, it's 3:00 A.M.

274
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,760
正常人应该都睡了
Any normal person is sleeping right now.

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,410
姑娘们
Hi, girls.

276
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,020
我一边听猫王  一边拼拼图呢
Just doing a puzzle and listening to Elvis.

277
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,900
趁你们还没累累  先来杯酒酒吧
You two want a mai tai before you get too ty-ty?

278
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,860
不用了  但说到累累
No, thanks, but speaking of ty-ty,

279
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,460
我想问你要一颗安眠药
I was hoping I could snag one of your sleeping pills.

280
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,410
没问题  我能给你  
Oh, sure, I can hook you up.

281
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,770
我从来不用
I never use them.

282
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,840
我晚上都只需要睡叁小时
I only need three hours of sleep at night

283
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,230
白天再睡个六小时  进来吧
and six during the day. Come on.

284
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,040
苏菲
Sophie...

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,460
发现哪里是新的吗
Notice anything new?

286
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,770
有啊
Oh! Yeah!

287
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,630
你头上接了更多头发吗
You planted more hair on your head.

288
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,950
我听说了
I heard.

289
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,220
麦克斯  你居然告诉她
Max! You told her?

290
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,990
没  这事都上新闻联播了
No, it was on CNN.

291
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,190
先报导了叙利亚的新闻
They led with Syria,

292
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,820
然后连续报道了五分钟你头发的事
and then did a solid five on your hair.

293
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,580
来啦  药跟香料
Here we go-- pills and spices!

294
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,820
你有满香料架的药吗
You have a spice rack full of pills?

295
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,300
改天下厨做顿晚餐请我吃吧
You gotta cook me dinner sometime.

296
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
我看看
Let's see.

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,500
鱼油  盘尼西林  阿莫西林
Fish oil, penicillin, amoxicillin...

298
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,580
彩虹糖
Skittles.

299
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,310
这是我的德国神药
Oh, and this is my German pill

300
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,370
哪天核弹大爆发  还是我被放逐外星时吃
in case they release the bombs or I'm ever abandoned in space.

301
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,310
给  麦克斯  睡个好觉
Here you go, Max. Nighty-night.

302
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,490
这样吧
Oh, you know what?

303
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,100
管这么多干嘛  老娘也来一粒
What the hell! I'm gonna have one too.

304
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,290
这是睡衣派对
It's a slumber party!

305
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,480
你又有另一架子[胸部]的药了
Oh, now you got another rack full of pills.

306
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,720
算了吧
Oh, you know what?

307
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,310
别等我了  麦克斯  估计得找一会
Don't wait for me, Max. This might be a while.

308
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,750
麦克斯  你真的得靠药物吗
Max, do you really need to take that?

309
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,040
吃完安眠药  很多人会做怪事
People do weird things on sleeping pills.

310
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,750
我一个朋友
My friend Candice Travelstead

311
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,130
梦游用奶油涂满皮夹  还打算吃下去
buttered a wallet and tried to eat it.

312
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,980
别担心  我没皮夹
Don't worry, I don't have a wallet.

313
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,820
等等  等等
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

314
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,450
你那颗是安眠药
Is that the sleeping pill,

315
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,290
还是我的紧急自杀太空药
or is that my emergency space pill that kills you?

316
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,250
两种都能让我闭眼安眠
Either way, I'll get some shut-eye.

317
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,110
麦克斯  不许
Max, no!

318
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,120
不许你抛下我一人在这世界上
You are not gonna die and leave me here alone.

319
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
在没有监护人带领的情况下  我还没搞懂
I still don't know how to go east on the "L" Train

320
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,830
怎么坐L火号车去东边
without a chaperone.

321
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,650
麦克斯  现在是凌晨3点30分
Max, it's 3:30 A.M.,

322
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,430
睡眠教练卡洛琳
and sleep coach Caroline here

323
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,510
最晚能让你在3点45分安然入睡哦
will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

324
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,270
你不是应该泡个热水澡吗
You're supposed to be taking a hot bath.

325
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,930
本来是  但当我把塞子塞进去时
I was, but when I put the stopper in,

326
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,000
有东西又把它给顶出来了
something pushed it back out again.

327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,050
药片在哪里
Where's that pill?

328
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,610
我藏在身上呢
I've got it on my person,

329
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,760
如果这些都不管用  我就把它给你
and if this doesn't work I'll give it to you.

330
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,360
为了药片  整只手伸入你洞内找
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill.

331
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,890
我都会做哦
And don't think I won't.

332
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,330
麦克斯  这是你的新寝具
Max, meet your new sheets.

333
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,550
新寝具  这是...
New sheets, meet--

334
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,380
用不着互相介绍  我又不是神经病人
Don't make me meet the sheets. I'm not a mental patient.

335
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,340
如果我是  那住的地方会比这好多了
If I was, I'd be living in a much nicer place.

336
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,420
而且我所有的枕套都会有花边
And all my pillowcases would have edges.

337
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,040
哇  你的枕套居然有花边啊
Wow, even your pillowcase had an edge.

338
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,550
你的枕套到底是什么样的
What was it like anyway?

339
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,450
就像是你新睡衣下面那样
It was kinda like the end of your new PJs,

340
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,030
但你的睡衣是我见过最基的东西
but not the queerest thing I've ever seen.

341
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,170
还点蜡烛  你以为我们是女巫吗
A candle? What are we, witches?

342
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,030
现在想象自己处在一个轻松美丽的地方
Now, imagine yourself in a relaxed, beautiful place.

343
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,330
让呼吸自由进出
Breathe in and out.

344
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,550
吸气  呼气
In and out.

345
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,480
听着  手指篮姑娘唯一了解的事情
Look, if there's one thing old finger basket know how to do

346
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,420
那就是"进跟出"
it's in and out.

347
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,560
把药片给我
Gimme the pill.

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,690
我还没说完呢
I'm not finished yet.

349
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,490
但先提醒你
But just so you know,

350
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,370
那颗药片在一个小时里变色了叁次了
that pill has changed colors three times in the last hour.

351
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,410
要么会吃死人  要么就是五彩糖球
So it's either deadly, or an Everlasting Gobstopper.

352
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,580
我真是被你气死了  你就拿走我唯一一样
I am so mad at you. You took my one thing.

353
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,930
我生命中有特别意义的东西
That pillowcase was my one special thing.

354
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,920
我的人生中  人们从我身边拿走了很多东西
In my whole life of people taking things away from me,

355
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
唯有那个枕套从来没人会拿
that was the one thing no one took,

356
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,170
而现在我再也睡不着了
and now I'm never gonna sleep again.

357
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,480
我爱睡觉
And I love sleeping.

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,640
做梦是我离有线电视最接近的时刻了
Dreaming is the closest thing I have to cable TV.

359
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,380
够了  麦克斯
Enough, Max!

360
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,410
在你对"一张床单"[屎]过分依赖的事情上
I've been very patient with this weird attachment you have

361
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,660
我已经够耐心了
to this little piece of sheet.

362
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,930
你才是"一坨屎"呢
You're a piece of sheet.

363
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,000
在我失去一切时  我懂得两个道理
Listen, if I learned anything when I lost everything,

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,970
那就是  第一  
It's that, "A," there's no wiggle room

365
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,050
白干酪的保质期限说到就到了
when it comes to cottage cheese expiration dates,

366
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,220
第二  你不能过于依赖物质事物
And "B," You can't get attached to material things.

367
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
得了吧  接发不算吗
Okay, extensions.

368
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,500
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

369
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,230
意思就是准确来说
It means that your material things

370
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,480
你依赖的事物粘了你满脑袋
are literally attached to your head.

371
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,540
完全不一样好吗
Not the same thing at all.

372
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,670
你满脑子都是你对那个枕套的依赖
Your dependency on that pillowcase is all in your head,

373
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,730
而你却不需要它
you don't need it.

374
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,230
那你也不需要这个
Oh. You don't need this.

375
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,840
你欠我14块
You owe me $14.

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,490
先记账吧
Run a tab.

377
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,500
我才不要坐在这里忍受你的侮辱
I'm not about to sit here and take this abuse

378
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,980
就因为你对一个枕套有着病态的依赖心理
because you have an unhealthy attachment to a pillowcase.

379
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,810
晚安  马里布芭比
Good night, Malibu Barbie.

380
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,380
希望你不是想要侮辱我
I hope you're not trying to insult me,

381
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,190
因为你这话是在赞美我
because she's gorgeous!

382
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,370
对了  郑重声明
And for the record,

383
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,640
我对我的头发才没有什么病态的依赖心理
I do not have an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

384
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
是吗
Oh, really.

385
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,100
你个禽兽
You're a monster!

386
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,040
对不起  人家睡不着嘛
I'm sorry, I can't sleep.

387
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,110
只要你把药片给我  我就没事了
I'll be fine. Just give me the pill.

388
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,340
只是你心理作用
No! It's all in your head!

389
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,700
快去睡觉
Go to sleep!

390
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,460
我用绳子把门把和我的床绑到一起
I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope

391
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,320
然后把卧室所有的窗户都关上了
and locked all the bedroom windows.

392
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,500
你是想伤害我  还是想让我欲火焚身啊
Are you trying to hurt me or turn me on?

393
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
你要做好心理准备  厄尔
Brace yourself, Earl.

394
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,640
麦克斯今天上班的心情不会太好哦
When Max gets here, she will not be in a good mood.

395
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,110
卡洛琳  如果我想跟一群天天好心情的人共事
Caroline, if I wanted to work around people in a good mood,

396
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,450
我早去谷歌上班了
I'd go work at Google.

397
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,060
她从昨天开始就睡不着
She hasn't slept since yesterday

398
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,900
因为我不愿意给她安眠药  她现在超级火大
and is furious because I won't give her a sleeping pill.

399
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,170
明智之举
Smart move.

400
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,230
安眠药只会把人搞得更糟
Sleeping pills mess you up.

401
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,470
我曾经吃过一次  结果在一天后醒来
I took one once, woke up a day later

402
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,520
发现自己科尼岛的云霄飞车上
on the roller coaster ride in Coney Island.

403
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,820
我喜欢云霄飞车
I love roller coasters.

404
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,310
但得是坐在座位里我才喜欢啊
Me too, when I'm in a seat.

405
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,540
你们好啊
Oh, hello!

406
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,080
你们俩今晚好吗
How are you two tonight?

407
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,090
天啊  她太友善了
Oh, no. She's nice.

408
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,770
她肯定从哪里搞到安眠药了
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

409
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,470
不  我没吃药  只是想明白了
No. No pills. Just had some clarity.

410
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,180
-请跟我来  -好吧
- Follow me, please. - Oh, okay.

411
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,090
你是"抽"明白了  还是"吸"明白了
Did you smoke or snort this clarity?

412
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,960
既然你这么好  送我新床单
Yeah, since you were nice enough to get me new sheets,

413
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,220
我也有东西作为回礼  给
I got you something in return. Here.

414
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,260
这是表示歉意的同时
Oh, is this like an apology,

415
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,830
兼表示谢意吗
thank you kind of thing?

416
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,730
给我看好了
Now watch.

417
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,000
人接受礼物时就应该这么优雅
This is how one graciously accepts a gift.

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,420
这是啥玩意啊
What the hell is this?

419
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,300
假发
A wig?

420
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,780
不然就是你剥了80年代拉拉的头皮
Either that or you scalped a lesbian from the '80s.

421
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,700
是的  我一把抓住她的波洛领带
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie

422
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,730
然后爬上她的垫肩[当年流行]
and climbed up on her shoulder pads.

423
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,910
你夺走让我有安全感的东西
You took away my security thing--

424
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,980
我的枕套
the pillowcase--

425
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,780
所以现在我要夺走让你有安全感的东西
So now I'm taking away your security thing--

426
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,930
你的头发
your hair.

427
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,200
你今晚可以戴着那玩意
You can wear that on your head tonight

428
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,450
然后告诉我一切都只是心理作用可以克服
and then tell me again how this is all in my head.

429
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,680
你非得买人家店里最丑的那一顶吗
Did you have to get the ugliest one they had?

430
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,180
3毛7的东西  你还想要求什么
What do you want for 37 cents?

431
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,000
好吧  我会把这个烂玩意顶头上
Fine! I'll put this roadkill on my head

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,830
向你证明  我的价值不只是这头秀发
Just to prove to you that I am so much more than my hair.

433
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,880
还有我的态度  心灵  大脑和勇气
I am my attitude, my spirit, my brain, my bravery.

434
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,770
-戴上它  -麦克斯  我好害怕
- Put it on. - Max, I'm scared.

435
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,410
快  把刘海拨到后面[从后面搞]
Go. The bangs go in the back.

436
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,440
我就喜欢这种女人
That's my kinda woman.

437
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,560
科布沙拉  上菜
Cobb salad, pick-up!

438
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,060
苏菲
Uh...hey, Sophie.

439
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,210
你是知道有黑手党寡妇折扣  才穿着这样吗
Are you here for the mafia widow discount?

440
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,630
厄尔  我在保持低调
Earl, I'm incognito.

441
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,260
偷偷来给麦克斯送药的
I'm making a drug drop for Max.

442
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,410
麦克斯  你的药[毒品]来了
Hey, Max! I got your drugs!

443
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,220
谢啦
Thanks.

444
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,640
我爱死你永远能找到一套
And I love that you have an outfit

445
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,660
适合我让你干的事的衣服
for everything I ask you to do.

446
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,970
那个金发缉毒特警呢  麦克斯
Where's the blonde narc, Max?

447
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,200
天啊
Oh, my God!

448
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,890
卡洛琳加入保龄球队了吗
Did Caroline join a bowling team?

449
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,550
麦克斯  不行
Max! No!

450
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,110
糟糕
Aw, crap!

451
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,600
被罗德・斯图尔特逮个正着
Rod Stewart just busted us.

452
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,600
英国老派摇滚歌手  发型类似

453
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,780
让她爽一下吧  有啥大不了的  老古板
Let her have some fun. What's the big deal, square?

454
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,490
因为她觉得自己需要这药的理由
The big deal is that Max thinks she needs these pills

455
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,580
是因为我丢了她的小被被
because I threw away her blankie.

456
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,120
那是个枕套  有它我才能睡着
It was a pillowcase, and I need it to sleep.

457
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,770
她得摸着才能睡
She has to rub it.

458
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,420
在波兰
In Poland,

459
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,770
我也有样小东西
I had this little thing that I liked to tickle

460
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,610
喜欢在睡觉前玩
before I went to sleep.

461
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,920
但也被我姨母扔了
But my aunt threw it away.

462
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,570
那是什么
What was it?

463
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,510
我的诺拉表妹
It was my cousin Nora.

464
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,540
-把药给我  -不要  
- Give me the pills. - Nope.

465
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,990
麦克斯  你是错的  瞧我
And, Max, you were wrong. See?

466
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,140
我一点都不依赖我的头发
I'm not attached to my hair.

467
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,430
老实说  我开始爱上我的新发型
In fact, I am loving my new look.

468
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,210
我是个懒得打扮的单亲母亲
Am I a single mom trying to keep it simple?

469
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,880
或是助理地方检察官呢
Am I an assistant D.A. in over my head?

470
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,420
又或是邦・乔飞故事里的查理兹・塞隆
Or am I Charlize Theron in the Jon Bon Jovi story?

471
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,580
或许吧  我完全不介意
Maybe, and I'm fine with it.

472
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,720
因为我一点也不看重我的头发
'cause I am not my hair.

473
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,710
天啊  火鸡叁明治帅哥  掩护我
Oh, my god, turkey club cutie! Hide me!

474
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,720
戴着难看的假发  双膝跪地
On your knees in a bad wig.

475
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,730
姑娘  我也有过这样的经历
Listen, girl, I've been there.

476
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,830
不  我只是不想被人看见
No, I just don't wanna be seen.

477
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,090
卡洛琳  卡洛琳  我爱你
Caroline, Caroline, I love you,

478
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,180
但我听不下去了
But I can't hear anymore.

479
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,280
这顶假发即使在70年代  也让人不忍直视
That hair was hard enough to look at in the '70s.

480
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,670
好吧  你是对的  我是错的
Fine! You were right, I was wrong.

481
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,070
帮我把假发脱下来  我不能让他见我这样
Now help me get this off. He can't see me like this.

482
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,780
没错  把药给我
That's right, gimme the pills.

483
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,170
麦克斯  不  你不需要
Max, no. You don't need them.

484
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,450
我们都不知道这药哪来的
We don't know where they've been.

485
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,890
好吧
Fine!

486
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,510
那我回家睡觉
I'm going home to try to sleep.

487
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,080
既然这都是你的错  那你来替我上班吧
Since this is all your fault, you can finish my shift.

488
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,840
你自己上班吧
You're on your own,

489
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,550
80年代肥皂剧那个住在对面街的女人
lady who lived across the street from Al Bundy

490
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,910
不得不说  我真佩服我自己也能接发
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed I can do this.

491
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,900
其实没那么难嘛
It's not so hard.

492
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,440
我不懂钱妮丝干嘛老抱怨
I don't know what Chanice is always bitching about.

493
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,780
或许她就是个爱抱怨的贱人吧
I guess that's who she is.

494
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,490
真不敢相信我到现在还没睡着
I can't believe I still haven't slept.

495
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,250
我这辈子都别想睡觉了
I'm gonna be awake forever.

496
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
最后会像那部电影《唤醒》  但我是想睡死过去
It's gonna be like that movie Awakenings, but not at all.

497
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
电影讲述的是一名医生在偶然的机会通过一种尚未通过临床研究的药物
使得病人走出了几十年的梦境

498
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,160
麦克斯  你可以摸我
Max, you can rub me.

499
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,460
哇  那顶拉拉假发把你掰弯啦
Wow, that wig changed you.

500
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,840
不  是这里
No, here.

501
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
摸我睡衣下面的花边
Rub the edge on the bottom of my jammie top

502
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,710
-把它当成是你的枕套  -不要
- like it's your pillowcase. - No.

503
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,350
如果我摸你睡衣的下面
If I rub the bottom of your jammies,

504
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,600
那我就会变成无下限
that would be my bottom.

505
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,900
火鸡叁明治帅哥没有约我出去
Turkey club cutie didn't ask me out,

506
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,310
可能是因为我的头发被假发弄得太乱了
probably because my hair was so messed up from the wig.

507
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,650
别对自己那么苛刻
Don't be so hard on yourself.

508
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,050
也有可能是讨厌你性格啊
it could've been your personality too.

509
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,760
你真的觉得他是因为头发才喜欢你吗
You really think he only liked you for your hair?

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,120
反正我是
I only like me for my hair.

511
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,620
早说了吧  你就是爱它
Told you. You're attached to it.

512
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,720
我超级爱我的头发
So attached to it!

513
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,450
用手转着玩  甩着玩  翻着玩
Twirling it, tossing it, flipping it.

514
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,500
在我的脖子  肩膀还有后背感觉它
Feeling it on my neck, on my shoulders, on my back.

515
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
没有光滑发髻的卡洛琳・钱宁
Caroline Channing without the option

516
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,990
就不是卡洛琳・钱宁了
of a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing.

517
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,070
对不起啦
And I'm sorry.

518
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,980
很抱歉我因为
I'm sorry I judged you

519
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,420
你对某物过于依赖而批评你
for having an attachment to something

520
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,100
而我也没好到哪去
when I'm no better.

521
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,360
抱歉我把你亲爱的寝具扔了
And I'm sorry I got rid of your sweet sheets.

522
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,190
麦克斯
Max.

523
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,830
麦克斯
Max?

524
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,860
晚安  麦克斯
Night, Max.

525
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,390
为什么啊
Whyyyy?

526
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,050
为什么我就不能拥有点好东西呢
Why can't I ever have anything nice?
