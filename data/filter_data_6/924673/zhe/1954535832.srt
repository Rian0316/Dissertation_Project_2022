一些孩子梦想成为宇航员

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,310
一些孩子梦想成为棒球运动员
Some kids dream of playing baseball.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,850
当我小的时候 我只有一个梦想
When I was a kid, I had only one dream.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,440
就是想造一栋摩天大楼
To build a skyscraper.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,420
那很蠢
That's stupid.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,960
这条路是坎坷的
There were some obstacles along the way.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,360
但是最终我的梦想实现了
But eventually my dream came true.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,980
我成为了一名建筑师
I became an architect.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,360
早上好  各位
Morning, everyone!

10

我有个设计大堂的创意
So, I had an idea for the atrium.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,660
看好
Ready?

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,720
圆柱
Columns.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,090

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,000
我不个敢相信你弄翻了我的模型
I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,060
不过...它不是最新的创意 是不是  圆柱?
Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,300
你一下惊世骇俗的创意是什么?天花板?
I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,880
地板?
Floors?

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,680
窗户?
Windows?

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,450
我知道你在想什么 这垃圾是谁?
I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk?

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,000
这家伙是汉默・德拉泽
Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers,

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,330
建筑界的一个传奇
a legend in the architecture community.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,190
在80年代最牛的
Very big in the '80s.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,930
他也是我碰到过的最最糟糕的老板
He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had.

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,460
当我设计了斯波坎国家银行大楼
Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building.

29
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,930
我忽然成了他的上司
And suddenly... I was his boss.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,430
- 并且他不喜欢我 - 楼梯?
- And he didn't like it. - Stairs?

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,730
老实讲  我也不确信我有多喜欢他
And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either.

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,720
以前  当我仅仅是员工的时候
See, before, when I was just another employee,

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,260
我是快乐  无忧无虑的
I was happy, carefree.

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,100
在休息室开老板玩笑的家伙
The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,170
你看他今天穿了什么?
Did you see what he was wearing today?

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,960
他的裤子穿到了胸部
It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
而且那件花衬衫 我看着它就会花粉过敏
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,150
但是...突然间 我成为另外一种人了
But suddenly I was a different guy.

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,760
伙计们
Hey, guys.

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,700
有什么好笑的事情
What's so funny?

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,900
没什么
Nothing.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,880
衬衫不错
Um... nice shirt.

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,590
谢谢
Thanks.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,300
在公司的时间是疯狂的
The hours were insane.

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,480
我总是在不停的工作 即使不是工作时间
I was always working even when I wasn't at work.

46
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,880
罗宾我刚有一好主意
Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.

47
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,620
无论你对我做什么 只要不吵醒我
Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,260
以前  我是这样的人
Before, I used to be this guy.

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,580
你应该请天假 去看喷火战机音乐会
Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert.

50
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,830
就说你病了
Just say you're sick.

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
但现在
But now...

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,310
我成为了这样的人
I was this guy.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,700
病了?
Sick, huh?

54
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,020
把你的衬衫扣子解开
Unbutton your shirt.

55
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,560
喷火战机 (衣服上的字)
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."

56
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,520
回去工作
Get back to work.

57
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,920
但是德拉泽仍然最难搞定
But still, the worst part was Druthers.

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,140
-我在想... -天花板?
- Well, I was thinking... - Ceilings? Oops.

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,890
已经说过了 在说一次 你似乎喜欢重复旧的想法
Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,590
当然 开玩笑的
I'm kidding, of course.

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,550
又一小鸟球 老板
Another hole in one, boss.

62
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,120
他一定长的很帅
Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.

63
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,210
为什么你会那样说?
Why would you say that?

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,180
因为只有帅的人 才能不负责任说那样的事
Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.

65
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,630
我发现那是真的
I have found that to be true.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,600
这是一种祝福  也是种诅咒
It's a blessing and a curse really.

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,490
你不能让他那样继续下去
Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,750
你得问问你自己 "谁是老板" (老影片名)
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,770
托尼  安吉拉  莫娜 (电影中的人物)
- Tony. - Angela. - Mona.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,030
莫娜
Mona?

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,550
仔细看看  你会改变看法的
Watch it more closely. Rock your world.

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,580
因此 你准备怎么做
So, what are you gonna do?

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,900
有的尴尬这人以前是我的上司
Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss.

74
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,060
所以 我和主管合伙人谈了
So, I went to talk to the managing partner.

75
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,420
炒掉他
Fire him.

76
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,890
我在想他可能 被安排到别的项目上去
Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,200
炒了他
Fire him!

78
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,880
他是一个自大的 过时 的人
He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass.

79
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,710
炒掉那个项目的所有的人
In fact, fire everyone on that project.

80
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,960
德拉泽 莫斯比 他们整个团队
Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.

81
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,360
莫斯比? 我听说他做的不错
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.

82
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,100
莫斯比可以留下 但是告诉他 他仍处于观察期
Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,470
过来
Come here.

84
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,990
我喜欢你  克罗斯比
I like you, Crosby.

85
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,970
不介意我给手机充下电
You mind if I charge my phone?

86
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,290
请便
Knock yourself out.

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,890
如果你真的想炒了德拉泽 把握好时机...
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing.

88
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,310
还记的我不得不炒掉 我的化妆师的时候
Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?

89
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,240
维基  我很抱歉
Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this,

90
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,440
但是一些预算被削减了
but there's been some budget cuts and, um,

91
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,280
我们不得不辞掉你
we have to let you go.

92
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,500
我的意思是  过了今晚
I mean, after tonight.

93
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,140
我仍然需要化妆上台播报
I still need my makeup for the broadcast.

94
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,110
因此
So...

95
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,790
我们为受害者家属送上祝福和祈祷
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.

96
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,160
你知道吗  我将那样做
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

97
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,120
我明天会炒了德拉泽
I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.

98
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,900
- 天啊 - 怎么了
- Oh, my God! - What?

99
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,160
- 你知道这个吗? - 不知道
- Do you know about this? - No.

100
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,250
那是什么
What is that?

101
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,840
到目前为止最伟大的事情
Only the greatest thing ever.

102
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,550
等等  那样还不够
Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup.

103
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,440
就算他们明天有医治癌症的办法
If they were to cure cancer tomorrow,

104
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,110
这仍然是这个星期最伟大的事情
this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week.

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,440
现在你们请看看马修的裸画
Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.

106
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,730
天啊
Oh, my God.

107
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,360
简直是太棒了　太棒好几倍
This is awesome times awesome.

108
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,940
不对　太棒的平方
It's awesome squared.

109
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,470
我明白 一直在钢琴后面
I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,850
如果马修把它藏起来了
Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it,

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,930
他显然不想我们找到他它
he clearly doesn't want us to find it.

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,480
不会吧 罗宾
Oh, come on, Robin.

113
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,330
我说他一定会很尴尬
No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,090
我们偷着乐好了
We are gonna have so much fun.

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,010
明白 一定很好玩
I know! We're gonna have so much fun!

116
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,430
抱歉 我迟到了 午餐持续的太久了
Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,860
你找我 莫斯比?
You wanted to see me, Mosby?

118
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,290
差不多4个小时以前
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,860
不好意思  那段时间
Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours

120
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,460
我在为你的大楼设计画图
drawing designs for your building.

121
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,080
这只不过是张鸡尾酒会餐巾纸
This is a cocktail napkin.

122
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,520
而且上面写满了脏话
Covered in profanity.

123
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,780
听着  汉默
Look, Hammond, um,

124
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,560
实在不知道该怎么跟你说
there's no easy way to say this, so...

125
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,320
我们为什么不到你的办公室去
why don't we just, um, step into your office.

126
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:52,722
# Happy birthday to you #

127
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,600
小子　真有你的 忽悠了我
- # Happy birthday to you # - Oh, you had me. You so had me.

128
00:05:56,617 --> 00:06:00,792
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #

129
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:04,113
# Happy birthday to you #

130
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,440
就这样  你没炒掉他
So, you didn't fire him?

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,590
我不能在一个人的生日开除他 所以人都会讨厌我
I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me.

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,270
另外 他们给我戴上了派对帽 我的威严也打折了
Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.

133
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,300
马修坐下来
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.

134
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,740
我知道你有多喜欢凳子
I know how much you love stools.

135
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,060
谢谢 凳子能 矫正你的坐姿
Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.

136
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,700
我要送你玫瑰
And, uh... I... got you a rose.

137
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,810
谢谢 很浪漫
Thank you. That's so sweet.

138
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,750
你们很浪漫
You guys are being... so sweet.

139
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,090
猜猜我得到了什么 新的飞镖
Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.

140
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,830
新的飞镖...
Oh, wow, a new dart.

141
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,610
新的飞镖很棒
Hey, that new dart is great.

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,930
我不知道你这么喜欢新飞镖
I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.

143
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,650
是的  罗宾 我喜欢新飞镖
Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart.

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,480
裸体艺术 (新飞镖的同音)
Nude art.

145
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,450
-裸体艺术 -裸体艺术
- Nude art. - Nude art.

146
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,710
这么说来你们发现那幅画了
Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,130
我知道这天迟早会到来
I knew this day would come.

148
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,370
你怎么会知道的
How did you know that?

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,370
因为我没有把它藏好
Because I didn't hide it very well.

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,240
这幅画的故事要从大学开始说起
So the story on the painting is that, back in college,

151
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,160
莉莉想为她的艺术课 画一幅裸体画
Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class.

152
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,040
马修不赞成这主意
Marshall wasn't so into the idea.

153
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,090
我只是不要某个男的
Well, I just... don't think that some dude

154
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,770
脱下裤子为你摆造型
should drop trou just to pose for you.

155
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,190
这只是为了学业 而且我找的是那个怪怪的学弟亨特
It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,980
就是那个留了撮山羊胡 喜欢玩飞盘的家伙
The frisbee dude with the soul patch?

157
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,670
他在学校里炙手可热的
He's like the hottest guy in school!

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,020
不  他不过比较强壮
No, he's actually a little husky...

159
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,660
拥抱他的感觉一定很好
Oh, he's just huggable!

160
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,270
而且这人令人费解
And complicated...

161
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,140
还有点古怪
and a little bit of a jerk.

162
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,820
但这种古怪正好是 你认为能改变的程度
Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.

163
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,950
好的  不提了
Okay, just forget it.

164
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,020
说我守旧  好了
Call me old-fashioned,

165
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,810
我只是认为你 只能看我一个人的裸体
I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.

166
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,460
那好　那你o我画
Well, then you'll have to do it.

167
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,720
开玩笑  要是有人看到?
Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?

168
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,080
我们都不是高中生了
We're not in high school anymore.

169
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,760
人们不会为了裸体模特而取笑你的
People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting.

170
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,530
我们都是成年了
We're adults now.

171
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,550
我们看到你整个屁股
We totally saw your butt.

172
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
这幅画o了我太多痛苦
This painting has caused too much grief already.

173
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,430
我马上毁了它
I'm destroying it right now.

174
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,520
不要 怎么了
Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?

175
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,650
放在哪了
Where is it?

176
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,110
如果你猜下面三个谜语我就告诉你
I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.

177
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,890
你挂在了酒吧 是不是?
You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?

178
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,620
为什么你破坏我的谜语
Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?

179
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,720
野外旅行
Field trip!

180
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,540
错 有人把你的画 挂在了酒吧后面
Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar.

181
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,720
经典
Classic!

182
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,680
经典的恶作剧
What a memorable prank.

183
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,290
马修 你要什么
Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?

184
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,280
我要什么  不知道 也许是啤酒
What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

185
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,330
和挂在酒吧后面的裸体画
and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!

186
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,230
抱歉 那幅画是酒吧的财产
Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.

187
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,690
我知道巴尼给了你幅画
I know that Barney gave you that painting.

188
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,030
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

189
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,490
不论他给你多少  我给你双倍
Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.

190
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,490
不相信
I doubt it.

191
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,340
不论他给你多少 我将再多付你10块
Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.

192
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,260
不相信
I doubt it.

193
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,890
你知道的 卡尔 你会失去一个老客户
All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.

194
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,450
不相信
I doubt it.

195
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,880
这副画是我最惨痛的经历
This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

196
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,240
下一步我们把他放在哪 在他的法律学校
Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school?

197
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,910
挂在公交车的侧面
Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh!

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,460
做一个广告牌要多少钱
How much do billboards cost?

199
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,990
冷静 不着急 注意策略...
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,350
我有了一个5年展览计划
I've got a five-year rollout plan.

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,960
我会这幅画享誉整个城市
I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city.

202
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,600
同时 在纽约之后...
Then, after New York...

203
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,140
一个我最怕的事实终于实现了
One of my worst fears has come true--

204
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,380
我刚看到马修 抓住裸体的自己
I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked.

205
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,760
我得走了
Well, I gotta go.

206
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,750
无论你信不信  我得回办公室了
Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.

207
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,210
我和你一起走
Oh, I'll go out with you.

208
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,320
再见了  伙计们
Bye, guys.

209
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,790
我希望你们不要取笑这幅画
You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.

210
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,350
我们没取笑这幅画 我们只是取笑马修
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall.

211
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,490
这幅画确实是很不错的
The painting's actually really great.

212
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
- 真的? - 是的
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

213
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,660
谢谢了
Well, thank you.

214
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,070
再一次看到它  使我怀念裸体画
You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes.

215
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,070
什么
What?

216
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,970
画我
Paint me.

217
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,860
什么
What?

218
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,770
画我
Paint me.

219
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,880
那是谁
Who's that?

220
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,500
谁在那里
Who's out there?

221
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,480
汉默 是你?
Hammond, is that you?

222
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,820
莫斯比
Mosby?

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,300
我和德拉泽 单独留在办公室里
Druthers and I were alone in the office.

224
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,660
如果我要解雇他
If I was gonna fire him,

225
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,660
这就是最好的时机了
this would be the best chance I'd ever have.

226
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,570
等下  泰德
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.

227
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,680
我真得和你谈谈
Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you.

228
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,770
这有点难以启齿
Look, there's no easy way to say...

229
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,240
什么 你在干什么
What, what are you doing?

230
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,580
在干什么
What are you doing?

231
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,420
我正站在这里穿裤子
I'm standing here wearing pants.

232
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,680
你想在这里睡觉? 怎么了
Are you sleeping here? What's going on?

233
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,350
好的 是的
Okay, fine, yes.

234
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,690
没你的事
Not that it's any of your business

235
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,530
但是几周前我和我老婆 有了点小口角
but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago,

236
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,480
我得一直睡在这直到她气消了
and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.

237
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,330
你说的没错  没我什么事
Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business.

238
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,570
实在开不了口
Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...

239
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,960
我骗谁?
Who am I kidding?

240
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,120
她再也不会回心转意了
She's never gonna take me back.

241
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,230
没事的
It's okay.

242
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,040
你要对我说什么
What did you want to say to me?

243
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,340
生日快乐 兄弟
Happy birthday, buddy.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
所以你一直住在办公室里?
So, you've been living at the office?

245
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,910
是的
Yes.

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,040
我是一个无家可归的建筑师
I'm an architect without a home.

247
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,660
你知道有多么的讽刺了吧
You see the tragic irony in that?

248
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,360
- 是的 知道了 - 因为我设计房子
- Yeah, I do. - 'Cause I design homes.

249
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,610
- 我知道了 - 但是我没有个家
- I see it. - But I don't have a home.

250
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
对我来说没什么可失去的了
Not lost on me at all.

251
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,650
但是我不懂的是 你为什么不去酒店
But I don't understand-- why don't you just go to a hotel?

252
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,140
你本可以睡在床上而不在这
You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of...

253
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,380
睡在我的建筑设计图
what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.

254
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,480
我怎么可以去旅馆
Why would I go to a hotel, when any second,

255
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,930
在这里她随时都有可能 打电话给我叫我回家
she's going to call and tell me to come home.

256
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,180
她是一个十分特别的女人
She's a very special lady, Ted.

257
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,520
她十分男性化
She's quite... mannish.

258
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,020
她给我一切我需要的
She gives me what I need.

259
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,800
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

260
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,590
不  不明白
Uh, no, I don't.

261
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,240
如果你在野外迷路了
If you were lost in the wilderness,

262
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,620
她可以提供我所需要的
she can provide for me.

263
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,700
那是假设
Well, that's the dream.

264
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,650
十分高兴今晚你能来这
I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.

265
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,640
我也是 汉默
Me too, Hammond.

266
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,700
- 叫我汉 就可以了 - 不 谢谢
- Call me Ham. - No, thanks.

267
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,220
- 汉哥 呢 - 不  叫汉哥很好
- Hammy D? - No, I think just Hammond.

268
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,820
因此 我猜你没有炒掉他
So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.

269
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,440
就差那么一点
I was this close.

270
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,490
同时  莉莉一夜没睡好
Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night

271
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,510
进退两难
in the grips of a dilemma.

272
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,090
- 亲爱的 你醒了? - 是
- Oh honey, you're awake? - I'm awake.

273
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,050
- 没事吧 - 没事
- Is everything okay? - Yeah.

274
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,980
我被一些事困扰着
I've kind of been wrestling with something.

275
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,170
如果我告诉你我有办法 付我们蜜月的费用
What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?

276
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,020
宝贝 我们已经付了钱了
Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for.

277
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,870
我们去地下溶洞 (纽约州的一个旅游景点)
We're going to Howe Caverns.

278
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,140
但是如果我不想 在溶洞里度蜜月
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?

279
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,840
它不仅仅是一个溶洞 也是一个迷宫
It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves.

280
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,760
这是一次地下冒险
It's an underground adventure.

281
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,890
那有一个洞 暗到伸手不见五指
There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there.

282
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,920
我们将会经历一种 全新的不同的黑暗
I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.

283
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,010
如果我发现一个办法 可以赚一点额外的钱
Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money

284
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,150
那样我可以不在溶洞里度蜜月
so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,

285
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,590
而在苏格兰?
but in Scotland?

286
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,660
- 尼斯湖水怪 - 是的
- Loch Ness? - Yeah.

287
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,700
爱丁堡  高地  格拉斯哥
And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...

288
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,600
尼斯湖  尼斯湖水怪
Loch Ness. Nessy.

289
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,140
我也想探索这个令人着迷的水怪
Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,

290
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,090
但是 我们负担不起
but... we can't afford that.

291
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,040
也许我们可以
Maybe we can.

292
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,260
画我
Paint me.

293
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,460
不明白
Okay, I don't get this.

294
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,510
你一直在取笑那幅画
You've been making fun of that painting all this time

295
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,150
现在你想我画你
and now you want me to paint you?

296
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,820
我们知道我们可以拿他折磨马修 因为他有羞耻心
We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame.

297
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,990
我没有
I do not.

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,760
在我身上原本长羞耻腺体的地方
In my body, where the shame gland should be,

299
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,180
长着第二个神奇腺
there's a second awesome gland.

300
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,540
真的
True story.

301
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,530
不是腺  我担心画
Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.

302
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,160
好的
Yeah.

303
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,920
画裸体巴尼是一个挑战
A nude Barney is a challenge.

304
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,230
但我想你的天分 能使他成为不朽的杰作
But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this.

305
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,080
现在正是时候 我31岁了
Now is the time-- I'm 31.

306
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,970
我在我身体最佳的状态
I'm at the peak of my physical beauty.

307
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,230
如果我是一个女的 就过了这个时期很久了
If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago.

308
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,490
很久了
Long ago.

309
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,860
算了
Forget it.

310
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,360
我答应过马修 他是我唯一看过裸体的男人
I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.

311
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,240
我给你5000美圆
I'll give you $5,000.

312
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,780
我们去尼斯湖
We're going to Loch Ness!

313
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,950
好的
Yeah!

314
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,700
这个司机叽叽歪歪说个不停
That cabby would not shut up.

315
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,680
我们应该叫他唐僧
Yeah, we should call him a gabby.

316
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,020
我刚在想 你就说出来了
I think it, you say it.

317
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,370
谢谢你昨晚收留我 兄弟
Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy.

318
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,040
忘了那些
Give 'em hell.

319
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,670
早上好 伙计
Morning, team.

320
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,400
我又想了想
So, I have given it some thought,

321
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,510
我说我们再考虑一下圆柱
and I say we revisit columns.

322
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,160
天啊  不要了吧
Oh, God, not this again.

323
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,880
一个穿宽外袍的人刚刚到 送来一个羊皮纸
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment.

324
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,320
让我来看看
Let me read it:

325
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,620
这是从古希腊来的
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.

326
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,960
他们想要拿回他们的建筑专利
They want their basic architectural elements back.

327
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,000
- 天那 - 什么?
- Geez. - What?

328
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,340
你没听到我说的吗
You didn't hear me?

329
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,200
宽长袍  羊皮纸
Toga, parchment...

330
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,270
能到边上谈会?
Can I see you for one second?

331
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,960
现在我有麻烦了
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

332
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,400
你在做什么
What are you doing?

333
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,960
我以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends.

334
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,050
你睡在我的沙发上 吃着我的麦片
You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal.

335
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,440
我给你拿了很多卫生纸
I tossed you more toilet paper.

336
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,720
我们是朋友
We are friends.

337
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,780
但这不会奇迹般 使你的烂创意变好
But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.

338
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,580
什么?我不敢相信
What? I don't believe this!

339
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,690
你穿我的衣服
You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes!

340
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,740
我女朋友的运动鞋
And my girlfriend's... sneakers--

341
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,950
你有一双奇怪的小脚
man, you have weirdly small feet.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,790
我希望你不会 让我们工作上的分歧
Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes

343
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,770
影响到我们的友谊
interfere with our friendship,

344
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,090
因为我现在真的需要你
because I really kind of need you right now.

345
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,520
让我们开始
Okay, let's get this over with.

346
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,470
我不想让你在这打电话
Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in.

347
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,500
这幅画假以时日 可能会成为著名的艺术品
This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art.

348
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,160
上帝赐予你了惊人的天赋
I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.

349
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,570
谢谢
Thank you.

350
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,150
我是说我自己...
I meant me.

351
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,040
我喜欢你那幅画里 体现出的气质
Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence.

352
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,380
憨厚  天真 又带一点聪明
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

353
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,080
但是我 我想要一些帝王气
But me, I want something more regal.

354
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,260
一种我的后代会瞻仰并说
Something my progeny could look at and say,

355
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,960
那矗立的巴尼・斯丁森
"There's stands Barnabus Stinson."

356
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,740
他智慧
He was wise...

357
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,930
并强壮
and strong.

358
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,310
我觉得你不必拿剑
I don't think your sword will fit.

359
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,010
{\an8}双关,Barney意为很多妹子说他那玩意很大

360
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,010
我剑太多了
I get that a lot.

361
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,320
于是当莉莉开始画画
And so, as Lily began painting,

362
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,250
马修想着5000美圆
Marshall thought about the $5,000

363
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,750
和他的未婚妻会做什么来赚到它
and what his fiance was doing to earn it.

364
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,460
这不对
This isn't right.

365
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,410
完全不对
This isn't right at all.

366
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,930
他终于控制不住了
Finally, he could take it no more.

367
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,450
别动!
Hold still.

368
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,810
别动!!
Hold still.

369
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,050
- 别动!!! - 快点画
- Hold still! - Paint faster!

370
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,010
我想是时候了
Okay, I guess it's time.

371
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,480
脱下你的小裤裤
Drop your shorts.

372
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,240
好
Yeah.

373
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,490
等等
Wait, wait!

374
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,150
还没做好准备 我需要...
That wasn't enough buildup. I need...

375
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,380
在一个没有正义的世界 一个人
In a world without justice, one man--

376
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,560
- 脱吧 - 好
- Oh, just drop them! - All right.

377
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,140
不  这不对 我们说好了的
- No! No, this is not right! - We had a deal!

378
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,070
我要终止这个协议 巴尼出去...
Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!

379
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,820
- 你... - 结束了
- You...! - It's over!

380
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,000
我不能让你受这些煎熬
Lily, I can't let you go through with this!

381
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,460
我找到一个我们可以待的城堡 但是还要再加200块
I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.

382
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,270
这不对
It's just not right!

383
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,940
那是美丽的地方而且那里还闹鬼
It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.

384
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,660
我不能让我爱的女人 为了钱出卖自己
I can't let the woman I love compromise her values for money!

385
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,630
我想我们可以 从他那多捞点钱
I totally think we can get some more money out of him.

386
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,320
我从不会让我的未婚妻
I'm never letting my fiance, ever...!

387
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,840
你还在着?
Oh, you're still here?

388
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,060
在你说任何事之前
Before you say anything,

389
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,600
我再o你5美圆
I'll give you an extra five grand.

390
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,890
好的
We accept.

391
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,780
你们这些人太好控制了
You people are so easy to control.

392
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,050
为我跳舞 木偶们  跳舞
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

393
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,040
那就是巴尼叔叔如何付了 莉莉和马修的蜜月费用
And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.

394
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,640
拜托 泰德 听着 我们为什么不回去
Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back

395
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,390
完成这个大楼的设计图
and finish drawing the plans for a building

396
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,770
一个在我看来 永远建不成的大楼
which, in my opinion, is never going to get built,

397
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,520
所以我建议我们 还是去喝两杯啤酒
so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.

398
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,520
不
No.

399
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,980
听着 汉默 这有点难以启齿
Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...

400
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,110
哪位是汉默・德拉泽?
Looking for Hammond Druthers.

401
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,960
在这  我就是汉默・德拉泽
Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.

402
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,710
这是离婚协议书
These are divorce papers.

403
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,320
已经送达了
You've been served.

404
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,960
天啊
Oh, God.

405
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,850
她真的做了这些
She's really going through with this.

406
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,110
一切都结束了
So that's it. It's over.

407
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,480
这实在难以说出口...
There is no easy way to say this, but...

408
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,660
他给了我沃尔菲的遗体
She's giving me the remains of Wolfie?

409
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,100
我的狗死了?
My dog is dead?

410
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,820
天啊  我不敢相信
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

411
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,080
她总是和它玩的太过火
She always played too rough with him.

412
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,740
相信我 实在难以启齿说这个...
Believe me, there is no easy way to say this--

413
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,080
祝你生日快乐 你们在开我玩笑?
- # Happy birthday to you... # - You've got to be kidding me!

414
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,920
你们不知道此时此刻 这对我意味着什么
Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.

415
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,490
等等  他的生日是昨天
Wait, his birthday was yesterday!

416
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,740
没错  但是昨天我们 大部分在蒙特利尔开会
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal,

417
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,970
- 因此 我们想... - 不要过生日了  不要了
- so we thought... - No! No birthday! No!

418
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,580
我要话要说 我现在就要说出来
I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out.

419
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,610
汉默 听我说 很抱歉你的狗死了
Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died,

420
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,140
你的妻子和你离婚了
and that your wife is divorcing you and that...

421
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,630
你的生活支离破碎了 那些人错过了你的生日
your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday.

422
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,530
这实在是难以启齿
And there is no easy way to say...

423
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,300
你在干什么  怎么了?
What are you doing? What's going on?

424
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,800
天啊
Oh, God...

425
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,630
拜托　你不会来这招吧
Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you?

426
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,660
看  没错 现在倒下了
Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground.

427
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,740
很好  但是你猜我会说什么
Well, nice try, but guess what?

428
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,550
你被解雇了
You're fired!

429
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,730
你被解雇了 明白了吗 听到我说了吗
You're fired-- you get it? You hear me?

430
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,500
你要走人了  你被解雇了
You're gone! You're fired!

431
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,790
站在我角度 我想我们都怀疑汉默
In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond

432
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,560
可能是假装的
might have been faking.

433
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,120
救护人员对也认为他不会有事
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine

434
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,600
大家都看到了 他们确实认为不是我引起他的心脏病的
and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack,

435
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,160
尽管他们说的那么不情愿
even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.

436
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,260
但最糟糕的是
And there it was, rock bottom:

437
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,070
他们都讨厌我
They all hated me.

438
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,150
不过  正当一切似乎失去了
But just when all seemed lost,

439
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,400
同时我职业生涯中 最伟大的创意产生了
I had the greatest idea of my entire career.

440
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,100
星期五鸡尾酒 好主意  头
Margarita Fridays-- great idea, boss.

441
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,530
画好了
Okay, it's done.

442
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,890
我出去了 因此你可以来欣赏下
I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.

443
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,700
非常感谢 莉莉
Thank you very much, Lily.

444
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,710
