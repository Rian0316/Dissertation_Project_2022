1
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,570
Morning.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,080
Morning.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,650
Sleep okay?

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,220
Mm-hmm. Great.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,990
Hey, can I ask you something?

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,310
Sure.

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,070
Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,530
of the Kama Sutra,

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,590
was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,790
Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman,

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,260
you think that gives you permission

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,150
to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,770
Hey, if you can find a book called

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,630
Weird Sex With White Boys, I'd be okay with that.

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,300
No, no, you have such beautiful eyes.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,800
Have you ever thought about getting contacts?

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,280
I tried in the seventh grade.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,680
I could never get used to them.

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,930
Oh, that's too bad.

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,970
Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,600
the coolest debate club president

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,430
ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,670
If you had them on now,

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,310
you could see what we're going to do next.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,120
Th-that's okay. I can infer from context.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,160
Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,940
Howard, if I may interject here

29
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,600
with a piece of friendly advice.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,690
Is working on magic tricks

31
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,940
really how you want to spend your time?

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,450
Granted, you're just an engineer, but...

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,690
that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw

34
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,660
or a thingamabob that may get you a "thank you"

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,240
in someone else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,590
Is the trick making him disappear?

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,140
Sure, let's see it.

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,060
Here, shuffle these.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,900
Okay.

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,850
Now spread them out on the table face down.

41
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,560
Pick one, look at it.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,500
Okay.

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,570
Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,130
Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?

45
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,360
Remind me, what's your birthday?

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
October sixth.

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,010
Okay, October is the tenth month.

48
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,470
So ten-- one plus zero is one, plus six is seven.

49
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,090
Turn over the seventh card.

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,780
How about that!

51
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,760
Is that your card?

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,860
Yes, it is. Very cool!

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,070
It's not cool.

54
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,320
It's a childish trick designed

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,480
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
How'd you do it?

57
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,270
A magician never reveals his secrets.

58
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,620
But surely a future Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

59
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,460
Fine.

60
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,220
Give me a second.

61
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,330
You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
- Oh, hey! - Sorry! Oop!

63
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,230
Sorry! Pardon me!

64
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,860
Oh, I'm so sorry!

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,850
Oh, that was my fault.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,010
Check it out.

67
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,200
I just got contacts.

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,480
One, two,

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,760
three, four, five.

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,870
No way.

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,720
That's your card, right?

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Seven of clubs!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,330
That is amazing!

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,830
It's not amazing.

75
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,850
All magic tricks are merely a combination

76
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,080
of manipulation and misdirection

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,510
with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.

78
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,700
Oh, really? So how did I do it?

79
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,040
I don't care how you did it.

80
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,090
I have more important things to think about.

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,450
Clearly, the cards are marked.

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,410
I thought you had more important things to think about.

83
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,010
I do. You just happened

84
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,000
to have caught me on a break.

85
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,920
Oh, let me see those cards.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,460
Big deal. Not knowing

87
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,560
is part of the fun.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,590
"Not knowing is part of the fun."

89
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,030
Was that the motto of your community college?

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,780
Hey, guys, what do you think?

91
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,250
Priya took me clothes shopping.

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,740
Hey, you look great.

93
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,640
Good for you, Priya.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,150
I could never get that stupid hoodie off him

95
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,480
when we were...

96
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
Well, you look great.

97
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,710
Thank you.

98
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,810
Let's go hang everything up.

99
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,290
Yeah, good.

100
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,650
New contacts.

101
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,830
I should have done this years ago.

102
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,640
So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,540
I'm not going out with him.

104
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,180
He can sleep with whoever he wants.

105
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,620
Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,500
Oopsy.

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
This deck is rigged in some fashion.

108
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,510
Fine. Get another deck

109
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,470
and I'll do the trick with that.

110
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,920
So you're saying this is a regulation deck?

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,340
I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.

112
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,780
You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone.

113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,770
Not that anybody asked.

114
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,390
How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?

115
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,520
Just two:

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,100
everyday and dress.

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,140
Listen, we need to talk about something.

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,180
Oh, my God, you're breaking up with me!

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,510
Why would you take me out shopping

120
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,290
and then break up with me? That is so cruel!

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,770
Leonard, I'm not breaking up with you.

122
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,160
Oh, okay.

123
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,950
So, what's up?

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,010
It's a little weird,

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,020
your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,620
I know.

127
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,450
I usually never see my ex-girlfriends,

128
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,550
unless their hard drives crash.

129
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,580
I'm just saying, how would you feel

130
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,000
if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,450
Um, not great, I guess.

132
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,090
But Penny and I are just friends.

133
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,190
I don't care.

134
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,370
This is a woman you have slept with.

135
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,480
If you want her around,

136
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,880
then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,730
No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

138
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,570
I gave up the gift of sight for you.

139
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,610
If that's not moving on, what is?

140
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,550
You need to cut the cord with Penny.

141
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh... okay.

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,590
You don't sound very confident.

143
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,430
No, no, I'm confident.

144
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,250
Its not like I'm unfamiliar with the "get lost" conversation.

145
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,210
Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,230
Thank you.

147
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,600
- I appreciate it. - Sure.

148
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,770
Oh, God, you smell so good.

149
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,730
Of course, that could just be

150
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,050
my other senses getting stronger.

151
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:11,930

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,400
Hypothetically, if I had access

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,930
to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?

154
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,000
Leonard, it's a source of great pain to me and my family

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.

156
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,830
Can we not discuss it?

157
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,580
I'm sorry. Never mind.

158
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,920
And was your card the jack of diamonds?

159
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,590
Oh, unbelievable!

160
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,220
Know how he did it yet?

161
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,590
Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets

162
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,660
when he can't figure out how I got his nose.

163
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,720
You know, I have some remedial magic tricks

164
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,300
that might be more your speed.

165
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,340
Like, ooh, look!

166
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,500
The pencil's rubber!

167
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,740
Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.

168
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,930
Oh, please, if I don't know, you don't know.

169
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,080
That's axiomatic.

170
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,250
Come here.

171
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,350
You're right.

172
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,670
Not too bad for someone

173
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,980
who doesn't know what "axiomatic" means.

174
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,200
What happened with the contacts?

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,460
One of them's upstairs.

176
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,120
The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.

177
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,540
Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?

178
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,830
Yeah.

179
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,500
You don't wanna wash that.

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,360
- No? - No, that's silk.

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,040
Seriously, what would you do without me?

182
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,610
Yeah.

183
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,850
You know, I gotta tell you, I think

184
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,970
- you got a real winner with Priya. - Yeah, me, too.

185
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,340
She seems really sweet.

186
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,440
Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted.

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,380
There are a lot of bitches out there.

188
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,800
Yeah, bitches are the worst.

189
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,430
All right, I'll see you later.

190
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,250
Uh, Penny, there's something I have to tell you.

191
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,910
What?

192
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,010
Okay, uh, how do I put this?

193
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,640
Um... are you familiar with Darwin's observation

194
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,260
of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?

195
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,010
Did they make a movie about it?

196
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,610
No.

197
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,920
Then no.

198
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,430
All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups

199
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,730
of finches competed over the same food source,

200
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,090
eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape

201
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,360
so they could feed on something else.

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,730
Okay.

203
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,530
So what do you think we can learn from that behavior

204
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,560
that we can apply to our own lives?

205
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,190
Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?

206
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,700
Sure, that has birds in it.

207
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,010
It's fun talking to you, Leonard; I always learn stuff.

208
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.

209
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,690
Do you really have to wear that in bed?

210
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night.

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,000
It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.

212
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,310
So did you get to talk to Penny?

213
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,570
Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.

214
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,860
And?

215
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,490
She completely understood everything I said.

216
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,310
Case closed.

217
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,500
Was she upset?

218
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,590
Maybe, but that's not my problem.

219
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,190
She's not my girlfriend, you are.

220
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,310
I hope you weren't cruel to her.

221
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,570
Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die,

222
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,630
or is that just nature's way?

223
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,300
Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?

224
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,080
What?!

225
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,370
I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick,

226
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,570
and I need you to pick a card.

227
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,650
I am not opening that door, Sheldon!

228
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,260
As you wish.

229
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
Pick a card, put it back,

230
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,640
and prepare to be amazed.

231
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,060
Did you pick one?

232
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,580
Yep.

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,640
Is this your card?

234
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,410
Nope.

235
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,170
Drat.

236
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,390
Is this your card?

237
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,820
No.

238
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,990
I'll be right back.

239
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,050
Pick a card, Sheldon.

240
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,850
Now look at it, and put it back in the deck.

241
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,340
Now do you remember your card?

242
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,090
Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory.

243
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,830
My apologies.

244
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,700
Now shuffle the cards.

245
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,210
Shuffling.

246
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,900
Wait here.

247
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,970
Processing image, cross-referencing...

248
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,910
Whatcha doin'?

249
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,250
I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.

250
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,020
What's up with the infrared cameras?

251
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,900
I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards

252
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,170
to determine which one's been touched.

253
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,150
By the way,

254
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,210
if you hope to have children,

255
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,620
I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers.

256
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,060
Your testicles look a tad warm.

257
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,740
Holy crap, are you connected

258
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,880
to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?

259
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,300
Yes. I'm using their Cray supercomputer

260
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,470
to analyze shuffling patterns.

261
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,620
Sheldon, that computer is used for national defense.

262
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,540
Hacking into it is a federal crime.

263
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,390
Relax, we're not under attack right now.

264
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,400
Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.

265
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,010
And is this my card?

266
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,310
Rats!

267
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,280
I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer.

268
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,070
Where am I going to find uranium-235 this time of night?

269
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,920
Come on, CraigsList.

270
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,920

271
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,700
Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?

272
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,430
It's okay, I like Indian food.

273
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,650
Or as you probably call it back home, "food."

274
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,180
Why didn't you wear your contacts?

275
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,030
Don't you like them?

276
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,040
No, no, I do.

277
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,230
It's just I knew I was having curry tonight

278
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,760
and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,120
You know...

280
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,990
...my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.

281
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,300
Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently?

282
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,990
Maybe. What do you think?

283
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,600
I love it.

284
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,510
That's great!

285
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,500
Hi!

286
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,370
Hi! Just hang on.

287
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,800
Small world.

288
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,830
You did talk to her, didn't you?

289
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,460
Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.

290
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,770
Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes.

291
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,220
Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look

292
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,130
like a mannequin in the boys' department.

293
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,230
Hey, did he

294
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,320
tell you I saved the silk shirt?

295
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
No, he did not.

296
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,950
He was gonna throw it in the washing machine

297
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,380
with his Spiderman underwear.

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,510
That's our Lenny, huh?

299
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,930
Yes, that's our Lenny.

300
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,490
So how's the food here?

301
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, wow, that is really, really good.

302
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,260
Oh, I'm sorry. You guys are on a date.

303
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,580
We can hang out anytime. Have fun.

304
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,070
Bye. Good night.

305
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,140
Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

306
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,300
Whoo! I really sneaks up on ya, huh?

307
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,000
All right, I gotta go.

308
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,000
It is pretty spicy.

309
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,690
Oh, I've been meaning to tell you,

310
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,120
I figured out your magic trick.

311
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Really?

312
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,520
Oh, yes.

313
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,120
In fact, I improved upon it.

314
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,120
I'd love to see that.

315
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,590
How about you, Raj?

316
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,890
Beefaroni and a show?

317
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,430
How do you turn that down?

318
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,970
All right.

319
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,400
Pick a card.

320
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,170
Okay.

321
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,780
Bippity-boppity-boo.

322
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,850
What's with the wand and the beep?

323
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,860
The wand is called showmanship,

324
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,260
and the beep is none of your business.

325
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh! Excuse me.

326
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,660
I'm getting a text message

327
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,850
completely unrelated to this magic trick.

328
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,930
Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready.

329
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,480
And your card was the five of spades.

330
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
Ta-da.

331
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,550
These cards have barcodes on them.

332
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,760
The wand is a reader.

333
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,850
It's transmitting to your phone.

334
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,310
I said, "ta-da."

335
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,150
Show's over.

336
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,830
That's pathetic.

337
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,460
Let me show you how a real magician does it.

338
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,720
Raj, take a card.

339
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Don't let me see it.

340
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,510
Okay.

341
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,710
Three of clubs.

342
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870
Son of a gun,

343
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,160
you're blowing my mind!

344
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,200
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

345
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,920
That does it. I'm getting uranium.

346
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,440
You ever gonna tell him?

347
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,350
Maybe. When it stops being fun.

348
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,280
So never.

349
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,740
Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.

350
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,030
Oh, okay, its not important.

351
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,810
It can wait.

352
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,520
No, it's all right. Walk me down.

353
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,810
So, what's up?

354
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,680
Uh, I kind of have a problem

355
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,310
I was hoping you could help me with.

356
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,510
Sure, anything.

357
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,250
Move out.

358
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,050
What?

359
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,510
Not far.

360
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,060
Hey, if you ever wanna start a family,

361
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,860
La Canada has some great schools.

362
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,250
Okay, I'm not moving anywhere.

363
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,060
What the hell is this all about?

364
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,440
Why does it have to be about anything?

365
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,500
Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate,

366
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,410
no questions asked?

367
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,630
Oh, for God's sake, Leonard,

368
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,210
this is about Priya, isn't it?

369
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,840
She doesn't want me hanging out with you.

370
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,780
Yes. There, I said it.

371
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,520
Okay, look.

372
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,410
I happen to like your girlfriend.

373
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,610
And she likes you.

374
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,320
No, she doesn't.

375
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,870
Not really, no.

376
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,980
It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on

377
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,490
I will keep my distance from you.

378
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,720
Well, now, hold on.

379
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,500
What kind of distance are we talking about?

380
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,700
Because we are neighbors.

381
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,720
I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.

382
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,700
You can hear my toilet flush?

383
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,330
I don't listen for it, but it's nice to know

384
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,430
everything's okay with your plumbing.

385
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,570
The building's plumbing.

386
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,280
Leonard, I get it.

387
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,490
You're in a new relationship now.

388
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,610
And I'm happy for you.

389
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,750
So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?

390
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,340
Well, now hold on.

391
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,610
How about this?

392
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,090
How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?

393
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Are you really that kind of guy?

394
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,480
No.

395
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,780
I actually felt kinda silly just saying "on the down-low."

396
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,460
Good-bye, Leonard.

397
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,930
Penny, wait.

398
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,060
Damn contacts.

399
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,820
Incoming.

400
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,310
- Hi! - Hey!

401
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,810
Hello.

402
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,410
Why so glum, chum?

403
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,920
Apparently, you can't hack into a government supercomputer

404
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,720
and then try to buy uranium

405
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,510
without the Department of Homeland Security tattling

406
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,220
to your mother.

407
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,270
Oh, that's too bad.

408
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,520
Figure out the magic trick yet?

409
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Figure out the magic trick yet?

410
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,070
Want me to tell you how to do it?

411
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,740
No.

412
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,360
I'll show you one more time.

413
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,290
Raj?

414
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,470
Hang on.

415
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,820
This time do it with me,

416
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,740
so I can make sure there's no monkey business.

417
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,540
All right.

418
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,660
- Two of hearts. - I hate you.

419
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,140
Yeah, he's gonna win the Nobel Prize.
