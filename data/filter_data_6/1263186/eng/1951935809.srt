1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,290
5 Years Ago,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,200
Susan Delfino Gave Birth To A Son
In Delivery Room A In Hospital.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,610
Moments Later,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,930
Lelar Dash Gave Birth To A
Daughter In Delivery Room B

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,520
Around 10 Ten At Next Morning,

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,140
As The Two New Mothers
Were Leaving The Hospital.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,040
They Nearly Ran Into Each Other.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,900
Of Course, They Never Knew This.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,290
In Fact, Susan And Lelar Would
Have Been Surprised To Know

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,130
How Often Their Pasts
Would Cross Over The Years.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,680
They Almost Met In
The Local Coffee Shop

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,210
And Another Time At
Their Veterinarian Office.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,040
And Again In The Bleacher
Of Fairview Flyers.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,150
But Despite These Close Calls,
Susan And Lelar Never Met.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,290
Until One Tuesday,

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,030
When Susan Decided To Take Her
Husband To A Fancy Restaurant

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,490
For Their Anniversary.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,790
At The Same Time,

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,450
Lelar Decided To Take Her
Daughter To Buy Some Ice-Cream.

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,160
That Was The Night That
Susan Delfino And Lelar Dash.

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,380
Finally, Ran Into Each Other.

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,280
Mike.

23
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,920
It Will Happen To
All Of Us Eventually.

24
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,190
The Moment Will Come
When We Ask Ourselves...

25
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,680
Where Did The Time Go?

26
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,940
How Did The Children
I Once Cradled...

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,730
Grow Up So Very Quickly?

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,330
How Did The Life I Dreamt Of...

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,370
Turn Into A Career I Never Expected?

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,130
And How Did That Woman I
Saw Each Day In The Mirror...

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Become Someone I
Don'T Even Recognize?

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,880
Juanita, This Dress Is Awfully Tight.

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,230
I Don'T Think You Can Get Into It.

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
No, It'S Pretty. I Can Do It.

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,580
How'S That One Fit? Oh, I Think
We'Re Gonna Need The Next Size Up.

36
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,150
Uh, There Is No Next Size Up.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,850
They Don'T Make Princess
Dresses For Girls Over 7.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,520
She'S Only 4 1/2.

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,440
Look, My Daughter Was
Invited To A Princess Party,

40
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,770
So I Can'T Let Her

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,820
Be The Only Girl There
Without A Princess Dress.

42
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,540
Did You Try The Costume Section?

43
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,950
I Bet They'D Have A Mrs.
Shrek Dress That Would Fit Her.

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,810
Juanita, Take Off The
Dress! We'Re Going.

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,490
No! I Can Do It.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,830
Look, I Feel For You.

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,250
My Niece Also Has A Weight Problem.

48
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,010
My Daughter Does Not
Have A Weight Problem

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
She Has A Little
Baby Fat, That'S All.

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,420
In Fact, The Only Problem She Has

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,780
Is This Store Being
Completely Unprepared

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,410
For A Perfectly
Average 4-Year-Old Girl.

53
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,880
Just Ring It Up.

54
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,090
No, No, No!

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,140
Oh, For God Sakes. What'S Wrong Now?

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
Once Again,

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,020
The Concept Is, Sweetie,

58
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,480
You'Re Taking The
Pie Out Of The Oven,

59
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,480
Your Face Aglow With Surprise.

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,570
Why Am I Surprised? Because
It Turned Out So Perfectly.

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,170
Well, That'S No Surprise.
My Pies Are Always Perfect.

62
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,160
All Right. It'S Your Best Pie Ever.

63
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,690
You'Ve Topped Yourself. Hmm?

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,620
Mm. And I Know This
Before I'Ve Tasted It?

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,930
Sweetie, Just Make
Whatever Face You Want.

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,030
I Just Think You'Ll
Sell More Cookbooks

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,020
If You Don'T Look Like

68
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,770
You Just Made Love To An Ice Cube.

69
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,930
Andrew, Dear, I'M Going
To Take A Little Break.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,650
Would You Please Tell This Gentleman

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,680
That If He Calls Me
"Sweetie" One More Time,

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,110
I'M Gonna Grab His Camera
And Take Picture Of His Colon

73
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,620
You Got That, Right?

74
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,090
Katherine, Hi. What Are You Doing
Here? The Waiters Need To Be Paid,

75
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,490
And You Took The Key
To The Cashbox... Again.

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,470
Oh. Sorry. Paid For What? The
Armenian Wedding? Lunch For 300?

77
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,370
It Was Right After The
Breakfast For The Garden Club,

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,910
Which You Also Missed.
Look, I'M Sorry.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,550
I Didn'T Know A Photo
Shoot Would Take This Long.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,700
I Mean, Who Knew It'D Be This
Hard To Pose For A Book Cover?

81
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, You'Ll Be Fine.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,990
If There'S One Thing
You'Re Really Good At,

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,240
It'S Posing As A
Chef. Okay, Katherine.

84
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,140
I Know This Book Has
Been Monopolizing My Time,

85
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,880
And You Feel Overworked
And Undervalued.

86
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,790
But I Do Appreciate You. In
Fact, I Have A Gift For You.

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
It'S The Galleys Of My New Book.

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,920
Read Page 2.

89
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,240
"For Katherine
Mayfair--

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,600
"A Wonderful Cook

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,630
And An Even Better Friend."

92
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,930
You Dedicated It To Me?

93
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,340
Well, You Make This All Possible.

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,590
It'S The Least I Could Do.

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,220
Ahem! Excuse Me.

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,300
Time Is Money. Chop-Chop, Sweetie.

97
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,840
Andrew... Do We Have A Backup Pie?

98
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,290
Yes. Yes, We Do.

99
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,450
Good.

100
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,840
And The Big Blind...

101
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,250
Catches A Jack On The River.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,660
Preston?

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,690
Mom!

104
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,870
What The Hell'S Going
On Here? Don'T Freak Out.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,570
We'Re Just Playing Cards. Oh,
Yeah? Why Didn'T You Play At Home?

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,040
Why Did You Have To Sneak In Here?

107
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,470
Tequila Shots! 5 Bucks!

108
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,120
Asked And Answered.

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,640
Okay, That'S It!
Everybody Out. Game'S Over.

110
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,330
Can I Have Your Chair For A Second?

111
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,170
Hey! Look Up Here!
Mom'S Here. Party'S Over.

112
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,430
Door'S Open. Out You Go. Go On. Shoo!

113
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,330
You Guys Have Pulled
A Lot Of Stupid Stunts.

114
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,470
But This?

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,870
This?

116
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,490
Risking Our Liquor
License, Our Livelihood?

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,410
Who'S Going To Find Out?

118
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,920
I Mean, We'Ve Been Running This
Game For A Month, And Nobody--

119
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,770
Unbelievable. You Guys
Are Grounded For Two Weeks.

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,740
But We Have Mecoming.

121
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah, Yeah! Keep Complaining.
I'D Love To Make It A Year.

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,780
Now Clean This Place Up. Now!

123
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,650
Wow. That Was Fantastic.

124
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,310
Amazing.

125
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,700
Whew. You Were Incredible.

126
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,150
So Were You.

127
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,270
Oh. And...

128
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,060
Time To Go.

129
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,240
Susan?

130
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,990
So It'S Been, What, Four Months?

131
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,190
Are You Ever Gonna
Let Me Spend The Night?

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,640
I Don'T Know. Come On, Zippy, Zippy.

133
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,220
Okay. It'S Just, You Know...

134
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,260
Girls Usually Beg Me
To Spend The Night.

135
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, Good, Then You
Shouldn'T Have Any Problem

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,390
Finding A Place To Sleep.
Fine. I Know The Drill.

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,640
I Can'T Spend The Night.
I Can'T Meet Your Friends.

138
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,660
I Can'T Meet Your Son.
I'M Just Wondering--

139
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,160
Is This Ever Gonna Turn Into Something
Normal? You Know, You'Re A Guy,

140
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,040
And We Just Had Hot Sex,

141
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,830
And I Didn'T Force You To Cuddle.

142
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,300
So Run! Go! Brag To Your Friends.

143
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,620
Look...

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,820
I Like You, And I Know You Like Me.

145
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,810
So Why Can'T We Be A Couple?

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,800
'Cause I'M... Not Ready For That.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,480
And What We'Ve Got--
That'S All I Can Handle.

148
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,650
Go.

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,030
Okay, But That'S
Only Gonna Work, Like,

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
500 Or 600 More Times.

151
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,940
Good Evening. Can I Help You?

152
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,080
Wrong Question. The
Question Is, Can I Help You?

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,010
Look, If You'Re Trying
To Sell Me Something,

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,650
I Don'T Have Any Money.

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,510
You Do Now.

156
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,680
I Don'T Understand.

157
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,730
I'M Here To Buy You
Out Of Your Lease.

158
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,730
What?

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,380
I Know. It'S Sudden.

160
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,920
But There'S Something
About This House That...

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, It Just Feels Like Home To Me.

162
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,500
So I'D Like To Move In... Tonight.

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,510
Tonight? Areou Crazy?

164
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,580
A Little Bit.

165
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,300
Okay, Here.

166
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,130
I Will More Than Cover
Your Moving Expenses.

167
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,040
Look, Uh... I-I'M All Set Up Here.

168
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,650
Besides, My Landlady
Would Never Allow It.

169
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,770
Why Don'T You Let Me Worry About Her?

170
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,320
Mm, No. I-I Don'T Have
Anywhere Else To Go.

171
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,580
I Think You Should Leave.

172
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,490
Look, Raymond...

173
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,810
How Do You Know My Name?

174
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,910
I Made You A Very Generous Offer,

175
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,220
And I Just Know You'Re Going
To Make The Right Decision.

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,790
Five.

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,860
Five What? What Are
You Talking About?

178
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,420
Four.

179
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,310
Are You-- I
Don'T Understand.

180
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,370
Three. O-Okay. Hang On For A Second.

181
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,820
Two.

182
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,430
Well, Raymond, Thank You Very Much.

183
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,990
Here You Go. Take Care.

184
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,120
All Taken Care Of... Mrs. Williams.

185
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,080
Thank You... Mr. Williams.

186
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,530
The Next Morning,

187
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,090
Edie Britt Decided To Announce
Her Return To Wisteria Lane

188
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,290
In A Way... That Was Guaranteed...

189
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,350
To Make A Big Splash.

190
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,450
Okay, You'Re Not Gonna
Believe This, But...

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,100
She'S Back.

192
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,230
Edie? Is That Really You?

193
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,180
You Know Someone Else My
Age With A Body Like This?

194
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,000
So You'Re Back?

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,740
What Happened To Your Tenant?

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,390
He, Uh, Came Into Some
Money And Decided To Move.

197
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,130
We Thought, What The
Heck? Let'S Move Back!

198
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,700
"We"?

199
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,740
Oh, You Don'T Know.
I Have A Husband Now.

200
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,950
Really? Whose?

201
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,590
So I'M In Vegas Talking To
This Real Estate Convention.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,390
I Do A Little Motivational Speaking.

203
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,810
And There-- Sixth
Row, Center Aisle,

204
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,380
Is The Most Beautiful
Woman I Have Ever Seen.

205
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,930
So After I Finish,

206
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,670
I Walk Into The Audience
And I Ask This Goddess Out.

207
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,750
His Seminar Was Called
"Getting What You Want,"

208
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,290
And He Did...

209
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,380
Three Times. Hmm. Before Dinner.

210
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,180
Well, It'S Certainly
Nice To Meet You, Dave,

211
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,680
And Let Us Be The First To
Welcome You To Wisteria Lane.

212
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,590
Oh, You Know What? We Should
Have A Dinner Or Something.

213
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,030
Oh, Let'S Make It A Party.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,720
We Could Do It At My
Restaurant. We'D Be Honored

215
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,970
Thank You.

216
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,090
So, Gaby, I Have To Ask.

217
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,670
What The Hell Happened To
You? I Mean, Look At You.

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,120
Your--Your Clothes,
Your--Your Hair.

219
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,290
Carlos Might Be Blind, But The Rest
Of Us Aren'T. I Had Two Children.

220
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,850
For What? Breakfast?

221
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,720
Edie? On Your First Day
Back In The Neighborhood?

222
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,590
You'Re Right.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,640
I'M Sorry, Gaby.

224
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,610
It Was Rude And Insensitive,
And It Won'T Happen Again.

225
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,620
Really?

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,890
Are You Okay.

227
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,060
Now Shouldn'T We Offer Your
Friends Something To Eat?

228
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,420
Ooh! I Baked Some Muffins.

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,980
Please Don'T Take This
The Wrong Way, But...

230
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,560
We Love You.

231
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,800
Mijita! Lunch Is Ready.
Go Get Your Sister.

232
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,780
Carlos, What'S With All The Cheese?

233
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,910
You Know How Juanita Feels
About Brussels Sprouts.

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,990
I'M Just Trying To Make Vegetables
More Fun. Well, Next Time,

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,060
Give Her A Carrot And Put
Her On A Roller Coaster.

236
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,540
Have You Tried To Lift Her Lately?

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,560
I Know She'S Gotten Chubby.
She'Ll Grow Out Of It

238
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,060
Ha! We Can Only Hope

239
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,970
With Your D.N.A. Running Through Her
Veins. Hey, I Do Not Have Fat D.N.A.

240
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh, Don'T Make Me Pull Out
The Solis Family Photo Album.

241
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,400
It'S Like A Bunch Of Sea
Lions Posing On A Rock.

242
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,980
Well, I'M Sorry My
Relatives Don'T Measure Up To

243
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,820
Thgroup Of Stick-Thin
Drunks That You Come From.

244
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,080
All I'M Sang Is That Our
Daughter Has A Weight Problem,

245
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,280
And The Sooner We Admit It,
The Better. She'S Only 4.

246
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,530
But, You Know, You Want Her
To Develop A Weight Problem?

247
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,830
Go Ahead. Nag, Criticize,
Make Her Feel Self-Conscious.

248
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,640
See What Happens.

249
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,200
And Obviously I Am Not
Getting Through To The Twins,

250
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,870
Because No Matter What I Say,
They Keep Pulling This Crap,

251
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,400
And I Am Sick Of It.
Honey, Could You...

252
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
Sorry.

253
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,630
Yeah.  So You-- You
Want Me To Talk To Them?

254
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,510
You Have To. I Am Tired
Of Being The Bad Cop.

255
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,860
You Walk The Beat For A While.
Fine. You Know, Boys This Age,

256
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,550
They'Re More Likely To
Listen To Their Dads Anyway.

257
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,210
I-I Can Handle This.

258
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,920
I Really Appreciate It.

259
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,190
Honey, You Know What I'D
Appreciate? Could You...

260
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,400
Sorry.

261
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,830
So Kirby Has Aces
In The Hole... Yeah.

262
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,990
Whicmeans That Bobby

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,690
Will Have To Wear A Dress To
School On Monday. Oh! Oh, My! Okay.

264
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,530
You'Ve Got To Get A Picture Of That!

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,350
Tom? Can I Talk To You A Sec?

266
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,730
Yeah.

267
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,560
Don'T You Think

268
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,550
You Were Kind Of Sending
The Wrong Message In There?

269
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,150
I Know We Don'T Approve
Of What They Did,

270
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,340
But You--You
Gotta Admit.

271
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,700
Come On. Starting Their Own
Casino Is Kind Of Creative.

272
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,740
Yeah? "Creative" Like Selling
Fake I.D.S Was Creative.

273
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,690
And Hot-Wiring Mccluskey'S
Car-- That Was A Work Of Art.

274
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,230
Honey, Honey, This
Is Nothing Like That.

275
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,580
I Mean, Look, The Whole School

276
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,300
Is Talking About Their Card Game.

277
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,830
Do You Realize It Was, Like,

278
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
The Place To Be On A Monday Night?

279
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,310
Oh, My God.

280
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,430
What?

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,260
You Think They'Re Cool.

282
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,370
Well... Yeah.

283
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,340
No, I Mean You Think They'Re Cool

284
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,920
In That You Wanna
Be Them. Oh, Please.

285
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,250
You Do! This Is Tom,
Former High School Nerd,

286
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,520
Living Vicarusly Through
His Awesome-Ass Kids.

287
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,470
Hey, I Was Plenty
Cool In High School.

288
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Are We Redefining "Cool"

289
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,220
To Include Playing Trombone
In The Marching Band?

290
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,960
You'Re Overreacting.

291
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,780
You'Re A Little High-Spirited,
But I Trust Them.

292
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,180
So I'Ve Decided To Unground
Them For The Homecoming Dance.

293
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,930
But I Told Them They Couldn'T Go.

294
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,010
And You Told Me To
Handle It, And I Just Did.

295
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,080
Oh, By The Way, It Wasn'T A Trombone.

296
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,460
It Was A Tuba.

297
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,670
Know Your Brass.

298
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,640
Juanita!

299
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,890
You Said I Could Have Cake.

300
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,170
I Know, But So Much?

301
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,170
You Could'Ve Gone Back
For A Second Piece.

302
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,160
This Is My Second Piece.

303
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,740
And It'S Not Juanita'S Fault.

304
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,980
In This Kind Of Situation,
I Blame The Parents.

305
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,620
Look, My Kid Would Eat Sugar
All Day Long If I Let Her.

306
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,640
Gaby'S Obviously One Of Those
Moms Who Just Can'T Say No.

307
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,540
It'S A Shame, Too. Juanita
Has Such A Pretty Face.

308
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,150
I'M Back.

309
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,580
You Want Something Cold?

310
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,290
Well, Actually,

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,530
I'M In The Mood For Something Hot.

312
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,620
You Know...

313
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,250
This Is Why It'S Taking Four Months

314
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,590
To Get My House Painted.

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Haven'T You Ever
Heard That Expression,

316
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,180
"You Can Have It Done Fast,
Or You Can Have It Done Right"?

317
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,770
I Think I'Ll Have It Done Right Now.

318
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,200
Hey, Susan?

319
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,350
Mm. Uh, Lynette, It'S
Not Really A Good Time.

320
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,620
I Just Need Five Seconds
To Bitch About Tom,

321
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,190
And Then I'Ll--
Oh, My God.

322
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,500
Your Painter Isn'T Done Yet?

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah. He--He'S Hard
To Keep Track Of.

324
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,880
Well, Anyway, Tom
Refuses To Acknowledge

325
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,970
That The Twins Are Turning
Into Juvenile Delinquents.

326
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,370
Just The Other Day, I Was-- Oh,
You Poor Thing! You Need A Hug.

327
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,420
Have You Been Drinking?

328
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,680
Sorry To Have Barged In,

329
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,180
And Thanks For Letting
Me Get That Off My Chest.

330
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,330
Hey, Anytime That You Need To
Talk, You Just Ring My Bell...

331
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,960
And Wait.

332
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,950
Okay, New Rule.

333
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,110
From Now On, Sex Only Happens
In The Bedroom, Door Closed,

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,750
Between The Hours Of 7:00
And 10:00 P.M. You Know What?

335
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
It'D Be A Hell Of A Lot Easier
For Me To Follow The Rules

336
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,570
If I Knew Why They Existed. I
Just Don'T Want My Friends To Know.

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,590
Why? You--You
Ashamed Of Me?

338
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,750
No, Of Course Not.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,420
It'S Just... Complicated.

340
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,330
I'M Just A Simple Guy,

341
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,770
So I Can'T Be Your
Dirty Little Secret.

342
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,730
I Need More From You.

343
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,870
I'M Sorry. I Can'T Give That To You.

344
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,010
Honey, I Know You Wanna Go
Home And Watch Your Cartoons,

345
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,290
But You Had A Lot Of Cake,

346
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,530
So I Was Thinking I'D
Take You To The Park.

347
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,980
That Way, You Could Run Around
And Get Some Nice, Fun Exercise.

348
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,250
No.

349
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,620
You Sure?

350
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,650
Running Around In
The Sun And Fresh Air

351
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,000
Would Make You Feel Good.

352
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,440
Mm... No.

353
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,930
Okay.

354
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,740
Why Don'T You Go Throw
That In The Trash?

355
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,340
And I'M Gonna Get The Car Started.

356
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,370
He Juanita.

357
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,590
You Wanna Play A New
Game On The Way Home?

358
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,640
Winner Gets A New Doll. Okay.

359
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,620
Well, Come On, Then!

360
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,840
Mommy, What Are You Doing?

361
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,770
It'S A New Game I Invented,
And You'Re Winning 1 To Nothing!

362
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,170
Katherine! Fantastic News.

363
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,460
"What'S Cookin' Fairview?"

364
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,880
Is Sending Out A Camera Crew Tomorrow

365
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,970
To Do A Piece On Me And The Book. Oh,
Which I Just Finished This Morning.

366
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,720
You Read It Ready? Yes.
I Couldn'T Put It Down.

367
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,720
But I Have To Tell You,
At Least A Dozen Recipes

368
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,120
Are Missing A Pretty
Crucial Ingredient.

369
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,680
Really?

370
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,040
What?

371
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,310
My Name.

372
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,190
Excuse Me? Bree, Your
Book Is Filled With Recipes

373
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,380
That We Developed Together,

374
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,030
And--And Some Of Them Are
Flat-Out Mine. Oh, Don'T Be Silly.

375
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,650
I May Have Based A
Few On Your Recipes,

376
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,520
But I Always Changed Someing.

377
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,800
Like What? The Font?

378
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,080
Name One Difference Between
This Meatloaf Recipe And Mine.

379
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,370
Well, Yours Calls For
Minced Curly Leaf Parsley.

380
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Mine Calls For Minced Flat Leaf.

381
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,840
It'S Minced! Who Can
Tell The Difference?

382
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,430
Bree, You Have Recipes In
Here You Can'T Even Make.

383
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Never Heard Anything So Absurd.

384
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,400
The Croquembouche Cake
With The Spun Sugar Netting?

385
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,140
I'Ve Never Once Seen You
Work With Molten Sugar.

386
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,050
I Always Make That
Cake. Really, Katherine.

387
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,180
Just Because I Let You Execute
A Few Eye-Catching Garnishes

388
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,070
That Gratify Your Need To Show Off,

389
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,240
Doesn'T Mean That I Can'T
Do Them Just As Well Myself.

390
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,870
You Let Me?

391
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,150
I Thought We Were Partners.

392
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,180
We Are.

393
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,280
That'S Why Your Name Is
On The Dedication Page.

394
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,990
You Were Right About
The Dedication, Bree.

395
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,740
It Really Was Theleastyou Could Do.

396
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,820
18 To Zero!

397
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,150
2 More Points, And
You'Ll Break The Record.

398
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,100
Mommy, I'M Tired!

399
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,020
Really?

400
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,540
Well, I Thought Running
Through That Guy'S Sprinkler

401
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,320
Would'Ve Refreshed You. Now Come On!

402
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,540
No.

403
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,590
Looks Like Mommy'S Gonna
Score Her First 2 Points.

404
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,670
Come On, Juanita.

405
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,180
Show Mommy What A Winner You Are.

406
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,560
Juanita!

407
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,210
What Are You Doing?!

408
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,930
Juanita, Stop!

409
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,240
Juanita! Juanita!

410
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,950
And While I Thought

411
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,030
Grounding You Was An
Appropriate Punishment,

412
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,510
Your Dad Convinced Me

413
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,770
I Was Being A Little Too
Hard On You Guys. Absolutely.

414
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,430
And So We Have Decided

415
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,240
To Let You Go To The
Homecoming Dance Tonight...

416
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,950
That'S Right!

417
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,500
In Your Father'S Convertible.

418
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,540
Um, Um, H-H-Hold
On. What? Wh--

419
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,500
Come On, Tom. I Mean,
We Trust Them, Right?

420
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,640
Yes, Yes.

421
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,840
I-I Would Trust Them More If They

422
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,830
Were Driving Your
Car. No! You Don'T Wan

423
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,400
Two Cool Kids Pulling Up
To Homecoming In A Mom Car,

424
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,620
Especially With That Big Dent
They Put In It Last Month.

425
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,030
Dude! Thanks! Thanks!

426
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,400
Don'T Thank Me. Thank
Your Father. Thanks, Dad!

427
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,380
You Rock! Uh, You--Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Here--Some Ground Rules.

428
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,200
N-No Muddy Shoes On
My Floor Mats. No--

429
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,000
Tom, Relax!

430
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,190
You High-Spirited Kids Do
Whatever It Takes To Have Fun.

431
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,100
And In Three, Two, One.

432
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,760
Welcome Back To "What'S
Cookin' Fairview?"

433
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,510
We'Re Talking With Bree Van De Kamp,

434
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,820
Fairview'S Premier Caterer,

435
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,240
Who'S About To Publish
Her Very First Cookbook.

436
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,100
Bree, Could You Show Us Inside?

437
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,520
This Is My Kitchen,

438
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,000
And This Is
My Staff--

439
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,510
The Most Gifted, Hardworking Team

440
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,900
A Cook Could Ever Have Hoped For.

441
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,170
I Cannot Say Enough
Good Things About Them.

442
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,660
So Which One Of You Has
Worked With Bree The Longest?

443
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,520
That Would Be Me.

444
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,610
So Tell Me, What'S It Really
Like Working With Bree?

445
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,790
It'S Inspiring.

446
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,930
There Is Absolutely
Nothing She Can'T Do.

447
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,790
Katherine, I'M Blushing.

448
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,430
Working With Her Has Been...

449
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,770
Such An Education

450
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
That
I--Aah!

451
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,740
Ah! Oh, God. Are You All Right?

452
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,520
I Think I Strained My
Wrist. God, It Hurts.

453
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, You Poor Dear. Could Someone
Please Get Some Ice? Oh, No.

454
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,260
Oh, And I Was Just About To
Put The Spun Sugar Netting

455
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,520
On Our Famous Croquembouche.

456
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,600
Would You Mind Doing It?

457
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,600
Katherine,

458
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,490
I'M Sure Your Wrist Is Just Fine.

459
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,990
No, It'S Really Throbbing.

460
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
Okay, It Looks Like
Bree To The Rescue.

461
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,360
Be Sure You Get This.

462
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,040
Really Something To See.

463
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,950
The Secret To Spinning Sugar

464
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,670
Is This Special Whisk

465
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,340
That Makes Lovely Gossamer Threads.

466
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,330
Careful, Dear.

467
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,660
You'Re Clumping. I Can See That.

468
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,270
That Stuff'S Hot!

469
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,660
Sorry.

470
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,820
Oops!

471
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,110
So That'S Your Idea Of Exercise?
Having Her Run After A Car?

472
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,850
Carlos, Our Daughter Sucked
Down Half A Sheet Cake,

473
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,000
And Afterwards, No One
Could Find The Candles.

474
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,670
Wake Up! We Have Got A Problem!

475
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,000
I Just Don'T Think The
Solution Is To Humiliate Her.

476
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,370
Now Even If She'S... Heavy,

477
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,340
Doesn'T She Have The Right
To Feel Good About Herself?

478
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,350
Hey, I'M Protecting Her. She
Doesn'T Know The Truth Yet.

479
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,250
Women Only Have Five Seconds
To Be Young D Beautiful,

480
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,730
And Then It'S Gone.

481
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,080
And Then Before You Know It,
We'Re Old And Fat And Married

482
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,450
And Wondering Where Our Beauty Went.

483
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,140
Gaby...

484
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,900
No, Carlos. I Mean...

485
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,880
Sometimes I'M Glad You Can'T See Me.

486
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,640
Five Years And Two Kids

487
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,150
And No Time For Facials Or The Gym.

488
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,270
It Just... Takes A Toll.

489
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,360
And When Edie Same The Other Day,

490
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,420
It Was Like She Didn'T
Even Recognize Me.

491
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,330
Listen To Me.

492
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,890
Nobody Knows Your
Face Better Than I Do.

493
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,970
And I See It Every Time I Kiss You.

494
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,870
In 5 Years Or 50,

495
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,830
You Will Always Be Beautiful.

496
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,680
Hear Me?

497
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,240
And Now To Finish,

498
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,830
You Simply Transfer Your Spun Sugar

499
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,400
To The Croquembouche

500
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,610
And Gracefully Drape It Around

501
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,880
In A Delicate Swirl.

502
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,440
Did I Meion That You...

503
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,150
Probably Shouldn'T Be Wearing Jewelry

504
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,770
While Working With Spun Sugar? Um...

505
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,970
Well, There'S No Law That Says
It Has To Be A Delicate Veil.

506
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,610
I Mean, It Could Really
Just Be A Beautiful, Um,

507
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,560
Little, Uh, White...

508
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,580
Ribbon.

509
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,710
Turn Off The Damn Camera.

510
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,150
Ah, Actually, My Wrist Is
Feeling A Little Better.

511
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,230
Why Don'T I Give It A Shot?

512
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,420
Whatcha Doing?

513
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,830
Okay, Where Are They? It'S
30 Minutes Past Curfew.

514
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,050
Actually, It'S 32.

515
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,200
If There Is A Single
Scratch On That Car--

516
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,550
I Mean, After All The Time That
I Spent Restoring That Thing...

517
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,790
Yeah. Remember When You Spent
The Entire Day On The Internet

518
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,150
Trying To Find A New Gearshift Knob?

519
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,190
Worst Anniversary Ever.

520
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,340
I Cannot Believe That
You Did This To Me.

521
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,470
I Know.

522
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,410
That Car Is Your Baby.

523
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,590
If Only There Was Something
I Felt That Intensely About.

524
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,510
Oh, Wait! There Is--
My Actual Babies.

525
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,490
You Think I Don'T
Care About Our Boys?

526
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,580
I Know You Love Them,

527
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,410
But Sometimes You Find Them
So Cool And Entertaining,

528
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,980
You Forget To Parent Them.

529
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,750
Lynette--
No, Listen.

530
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,730
This Is Important.

531
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,380
When They Were Little
And They'D Act Out,

532
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,010
And We'D Always Say,
"Relax! They'Re Young.

533
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,500
When They'Re Older, They'Ll Get It."

534
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,040
Well, Tom, They'Re 16 Now.

535
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,230
Not Getting It.

536
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,130
We Have A Lot Of Work To
Do In A Very Short Time,

537
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,920
And If You And I Aren'T In Sync,

538
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,240
I'M Afraid It'S Not Gonna Happen.

539
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,100
Hey, Sorry We'Re Late. Yeah. But,
Dad, You Have To Hear This Story.

540
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,270
We Just Pulled Up At An Intersection,

541
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,870
And There Were These Two Hot
Girls-- I Don'T Want To Hear It.

542
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,200
You Ever Hear Of A Thing
Called A Cell Phone?

543
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,210
We'Re Only, Like, 35 Minutes Late.

544
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,390
Yeah, 35 Minutes, During Which Time

545
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,890
Your Mother And I
Have Been Worried Ck.

546
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,510
But,
Dad--

547
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,380
You Broke The Rules.
There Are Consequences.

548
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,910
You'Re Both Grounded For A Month.

549
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,120
This Sucks! You'Re Only Doing This

550
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,730
'Cause You Were Worried
About Your Precious Car.

551
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,800
You Think? Get Out Of The Way.

552
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,670
Any Other Opinions
You'D Like To Share?

553
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,390
Thank You.

554
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,980
But You Didn'T Have To...

555
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,470
That Mirror Was Scratched.

556
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,690
I Already Ordered A New One.

557
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,730
Mrs. Mccluskey! You'Re Still Alive!

558
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,720
Oh, It'S Nice To See You, Too, Edie.

559
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
This Is My Husband, Dave Williams.

560
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,350
So How Did You Two Meet?

561
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,150
You Run A Free Clinic Or Something?

562
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,450
I'M Sorry. Who Are
You? Karen Mccluskey,

563
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,070
Edie'S Best Friend On The Street.

564
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,340
Well, It'S A Real
Pleasure To Meet You.

565
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,190
What Are You Doing Here?

566
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
Um, I Just Need To Talk To You.

567
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,870
Not Here. Go Home. I'Ll Call You.

568
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,080
When?

569
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,720
I Don'T Know. Later. Just Go.

570
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,430
I Have To Say, Ladies,

571
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,970
This Is Quite A Shindig.

572
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,990
Oh, I'M Glad You'Re
Enjoying Yourself.

573
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,810
Yeah, I Mean, There'S
Really Not A Lot Of People

574
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,160
Who Go To This Much Trouble To
Say They'Re Sorry. Excuse Me?

575
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,850
Well, The Party. It'S Just
A Beautiful Way To Apologize.

576
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,770
Edie, This Is Not A
"We'Re Sorry" Party.

577
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,160
This Is A "We Forgive You" Party.

578
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,730
You Forgive Me?

579
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,510
Well, I Think What Gaby Means Is

580
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,490
You Were Fairly Awful To
Us Right Before You Left,

581
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,940
And This Is Our Way
Of Welcoming You Back

582
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,620
To Hopefully Not Do It Again.

583
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,680
You Gotta Be Kidding.

584
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,230
You Froze Me Out.

585
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,820
You Threatened To Ruin My Business,

586
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,830
And You Ran Me Out Of Town.

587
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,310
Now It'S Taken Me Five
Years To Stop Hating You.

588
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,900
Great Party, Ladies.

589
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,580
Thank You Very Much.

590
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,810
Now... Mind If I Steal My Wife?

591
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,450
Sweetheart?

592
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,940
Isn'T That Your Painter?

593
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,210
Is It? I Can'T Tell.

594
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,340
Ooh! Excuse Me. It'S Okay.

595
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,170
Didn'T They Pay The Bill?

596
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,200
All Right. Calm Down.
I'Ll Take Care Of It.

597
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,620
You, Come With Me.

598
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,920
Why Would You Humiliate
Me In Front Of My Friends?

599
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,390
Are You A Lunatic?

600
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,680
I-I'M Just Trying To
Get Through To You.

601
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,290
And, Yeah, It'S
Making Me Kinda Crazy.

602
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Susan... Why Can'T
I Meet Your Friends?

603
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,290
I Mean, Am I Really That Horrible?

604
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,990
No, Of Course Not. My
Friends Would Love You.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,660
Then What Is The Problem?

606
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,940
The Problem Is,

607
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,410
If You Meet My Friends,
Then We'Re In A Relationship,

608
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,580
And I Can'T Be In A
Relationship Right Now.

609
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,010
But I-I Promise, I'Ll
Make You Very Happy.

610
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,830
Well, Maybe I Don'T
Deserve To Be Happy.

611
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,850
A Few Years Ago...

612
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,050
There Was This Car Accident...

613
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,700
A Bad One.

614
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,130
Take The High Road?

615
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,120
Did You Hear What Those
Smug Bitches Said To Me?

616
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,120
Edie, It'S Important
These People Like Us.

617
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,340
It'S Our Home Now.

618
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,960
I Never Should'Ve Let You
Talk Me Into Moving Back Here.

619
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,210
Why? Why Were You So
Gung Ho On Wisteria Lane?

620
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,850
Listen To Your Husband.
We Can Be Happy Here,

621
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,890
But We Need These People To Like Us.

622
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,560
Why?

623
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,010
It'Ll Just Make Everything Easier.

624
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,510
That Was An Accident.

625
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Susan, You Can'T
Feel Guilty About It.

626
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,190
You Know What, Jackson?
You'Re Not Gonna Say Anything

627
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,240
I Haven'T Already
Heard A Million Times.

628
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,850
I-I Only Told You Because I...

629
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,970
I Just Want You To Understand

630
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,060
Why I Can'T Let You In My Life.

631
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,890
Well...

632
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,360
Do You Mind If I Hang Out
For The Next Few Months

633
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,330
And See If You Change Your Mind?

634
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,190
Yeah, I Guess I Could Handle That.

635
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,290
Well, Why Don'T You...

636
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,430
Go Have Fun With Your Friends?

637
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,720
And Just Call Me When You'Re Free.

638
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,940
Okay.

639
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Please, Danielle. You
Have No Right To Take Him.

640
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,790
I Have Every Right. He'S My Kid.

641
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,780
Danielle, We Agreed
I Would Raise Him.

642
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,230
We Agreed It Would Be Best!

643
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,090
You Said It Would Be Best!
I'Ve Had No Say In Anything!

644
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,800
But I Am Married Now,
And Leo'S A Lawyer.

645
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,450
So Do Yourself A Favor And
Don'T Try To Fight This!

646
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,200
Please, Danielle, We Can
Have Any Arrangement You Like.

647
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,100
Please, Just Don'T Take Him!

648
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,740
For God Sakes, Orson'S Gone.

649
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,220
You Kids Are Grown.
Benjamin'S All I Have!

650
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,510
You'Re Just Gonna Have
Tfind Something Else.

651
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,160
Honey, Come To Bed. It'S After 2:00.

652
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,410
The Cooking Show Agreed
To Redo My Segment.

653
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,440
I Wanna Make Sure
It'S Perfect This Time.

654
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,040
Well, I Won'T Tell You
How To Run Your Business.

655
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,540
It'S Your Baby.

656
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,560
Yes, It Is.

657
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,740
Hey. Um, M.J. Ready?

658
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,770
Yeah, He'S Upstairs Waiting For You.

659
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,520
I Told You The Brakes Were Squeaking.

660
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,170
I Asked You To Get Them
Checked. And I Checked 'Em!

661
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,760
I Meant A Mechanic...

662
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,830
Not You. It Was Not
The Brakes, Susan.

663
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,560
If It Had Been, It
Wouldn'T Have Mattered.

664
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,490
They Crashed Into Us!
And We Killed Them, Mike!

665
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,560
We Didn'T Kill Them! They Died.

666
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,940
They Were A Mother And A Child.

667
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,850
She Was A Mother, Just Like Me...

668
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,800
With A Child Just Like Ours.

669
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,120
And If It Weren'T For Us,
They Would Still Be Alive.

670
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,480
Yeah, We Have Been Over
And Over This, Susan.

671
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,310
It'S--It'S Like You Want To Suffer.
It'S Like You Don'T Care At All,

672
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,930
Like You Feel Nothing
For Those People.

673
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,960
I Can'T Do This Again! I Just Can'T!

674
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,440
Hey. Did You Pack Your Dinosaur Book

675
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,820
So You Can Read It With
Your Daddy? Sure Did.

676
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,970
Oh, Good. Mmm.

677
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,680
Okay, You Have Fun, Sweetie.

678
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,890
So, Um, I'Ll Probably Bring Him
Back Sunday Around 6:00 Or So.

679
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,230
Fine.

680
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,320
Well, Have A Good Weekend.
Doing Anything Special?

681
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,080
Well, I'Ve Sort Of
Starteseeing Someone.

682
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,670
So I Might Do Something With Him.

683
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
Good For You.

684
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,530
It Goes By So Quickly.

685
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,760
In A Flash,

686
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,220
The Life We Knew Is Gone Forever.

687
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,790
And We'Re Left To Ask Ourselves...

688
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,190
How Could He Have Left Me?

689
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,140
When Did My Beauty Start To Fade?

690
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,510
Why Has My Friend Changed?

691
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,590
Was I The Best Mother
I Could Have Been?

692
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,860
Of Course, There Are Some People

693
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,040
Who Understand How
Quickly Time Passes.

694
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,310
That'S Why They'Re So Determined

695
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,980
To Get What They Want

696
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,530
Before It'S Too Late.

697
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,460
Oh, Dr. Heller. I'Ve
Been Meaning To Call You.

698
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,770
Yeah, I Was Getting Concerned.

699
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,940
You'Re Required To
Check In Once A Month.

700
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,290
It Was A Condition Of Your Release.

701
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,410
Oh, Come On. That Was A Year Ago.

702
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,170
But To Be Honest, The
Meds Are Working So Well,

703
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,320
I Kinda Forgot About You. No Offense.

704
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,520
Dave, Once A Month. Not Optional.

705
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,180
Message Received, Doc.

706
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,740
But Seriously, You Don'T Need
To Worry About Me. I'M Great.

707
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,670
I'Ll Talk To You In A Month.

708
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,190
Just Tell Me.

709
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,160
What Are The Magic
Words That I'Ve Gotta Say

710
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,120
So You Will Let Me Out Of Here?
Dave, You'Ve Been Here Six Weeks,

711
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,400
And You Don'T Seem Any Closer

712
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,560
To Coming To Terms With Your
Rage. I'Ve Come To Terms With It,

713
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,650
And I Like It Just The Way It Is.

714
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,350
The Charges Were Dropped
Because You Agreed

715
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,410
To Put Yourself In A Doctor'S Care.

716
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,320
I'M Not Going To
Authorize Your Release

717
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,900
Until I See Some Real Progress.

718
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,660
Wh-What'S Progress Supposed
To Look Like To You, Doc?

719
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,670
I Mean, Should I Just Plaster
Some Fake Smile On My Face

720
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,540
And Pretend This--This
Thing That'S Inside Me

721
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,510
Isn'T Eatin' Me Alive?

722
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,500
'Cause I Can Do That If You
Want. I Need To Make Sure

723
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,540
You'Re Not A Danger To
Yourself Or To Others.

724
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,330
Listen, I'Ve Never
Been A Danger To Myself.

725
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,200
And As Far As The
Others Are Concerned,

726
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,770
There'S Only One Person
Who Should Be Worried.
