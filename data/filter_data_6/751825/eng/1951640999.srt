1
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:42,809
Item 7. What is item 7?

2
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:44,963
Well, if I may just recapitulate...

3
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,441
- Ahem.
- Sorry, Minister.

4
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,809
You can't actually recapitulate an item
if you haven't started it yet.

5
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,369
Thank you. Where would we be
without you? May I continue?

6
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:02,320
Recapitulating on our last meeting
and the minutes, which you doubtless received...

7
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,926
Doubtless, yes, yes.

8
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,811
Er... what minutes, Humphrey?

9
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:11,965
Disciplinary action against
the South Derbyshire local authority.

10
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:17,127
Ah, yes... Will you remind me, Bernard?

11
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:22,082
They failed to complete their statutory returns
and supply us with statistical information.

12
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:25,244
- What'll we do?
- The action we can take?

13
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:29,406
A rebuke from the minister,
press statement about their incompetence,

14
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:33,281
the withholding of grants or ultimately,
as you are fully aware...

15
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:35,444
Yes, of course.

16
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,169
Good.

17
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:40,763
I'm fully aware of what?

18
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:45,328
- What?
- What am I fully aware of?

19
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:50,611
- Um... I can't think of anything. I mean...
- You said, ultimately, as I am fully...

20
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,163
Ultimately, taking the local authority
to court. Sorry.

21
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,129
Is it that serious?

22
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,852
- Serious? It's catastrophic!
- Why?

23
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:04,689
If local authorities don't send us statistics,
government figures will be a nonsense.

24
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:08,686
- They'll be incomplete.
- Government figures are a nonsense, anyway.

25
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:13,642
I think Sir Humphrey wants to ensure
they're a complete nonsense.

26
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,763
I mean... er...

27
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,129
Why should we make an example
of South Derbyshire?

28
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:24,046
Do you object because the council's
controlled by your party?

29
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,203
Oh, no, no, no.

30
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:30,410
No, no, no. But couldn't we just...
pick on an opposition council?

31
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:34,167
- Oh, Minister!
- Is South Derbyshire all that bad?

32
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:39,326
Terrible! They won't return their blue forms!

33
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,725
They haven't completed last year's
employment trends questionnaire!

34
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:47,886
They replied to our ethnic personnel
breakdown request in longhand

35
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,407
on the back of a departmental circular!

36
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,361
We haven't had their social worker
revised analysis for the last two quarters

37
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:59,330
or their data-processing appropriation tables!

38
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,848
They're unbelievable! Really evil!

39
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:05,721
What, because they won't return
their forms in triplicate?

40
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,964
I don't see how life can go on in Derbyshire!

41
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,921
Exactly, Minister. They really are
in a class of their own for incompetence.

42
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:17,290
- Have they no redeeming features?
- It is fascinating...

43
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:21,046
If that's all right, we can take coercive action.

44
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:24,408
- The minister might like to know...
- You approve?

45
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:31,004
- Yes, it's a difficult one. They're friends.
- They are no friends of good administration.

46
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,959
Well, give me 24 hours.
I'll have to square the party organisation.

47
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:40,127
Get the chairman invited
to one of those drinky-do's at Number 10.

48
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:45,321
- Soften the blow. Right, anything else?
- No, I think that seems to be all.

49
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:54,846
Richard, I need your advice,
if you can spare a moment.

50
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:59,284
Bernard, I'm not happy about...

51
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:01,728
- (DOOR CLOSES)
...disciplining South Derbyshire.

52
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,248
- Why not, Minister?
- Instinct.

53
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:09,726
Dr Cartwright seemed to be trying to tell me
something. I think I'll drop in on him.

54
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,848
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

55
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:16,004
If ministers want to know anything,
it will be brought to their notice.

56
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,720
If they go out looking for information,
they might...

57
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,200
- Find it?
- Yes.

58
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:27,484
Sir Humphrey does not take kindly
to ministers dropping in on people.

59
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:31,405
- Going walkabout, he calls it.
- The Queen does it.

60
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:36,609
She doesn't drop in on Under-Secretaries,
not in Sir Humphrey's department.

61
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,968
- What's his room number?
- I must advise you against this.

62
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,725
- Advice noted.
- Room 4017.

63
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:47,051
Down one flight, second corridor on the left.

64
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,999
If I'm not back in 48 hours,
send out a search party!

65
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:59,405
Hello, Graham, it's Bernard. Tell Sir Humphrey
that the Minister's just gone walkabout.

66
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,767
Yes, yes, AWOL.

67
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,760
Well, of course I told him, yes.

68
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,925
I know.
I think you'd better let him know right away.

69
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:18,167
One... two... three... four... five...

70
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:23,325
...six... seven... eight... nine... TEN.

71
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:25,483
What's all this about?

72
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,963
The minister's just left the office, that's all.

73
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,521
That's all?
Do you mean he's loose in the building?

74
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,729
- Why didn't you warn me?
- I did advise him, but he is the minister.

75
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:42,361
There's no prohibition
against ministers talking to their staff.

76
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,001
- Who's he talking to?
- Perhaps he was just restless.

77
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:50,131
If the minister's restless,
he can feed the ducks in St James's Park!

78
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:54,845
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.
- Tell me who the minister's talking to.

79
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:59,361
Well, surely the minister can talk to anyone.

80
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,367
Bernard... I'm in the middle
of writing your annual report.

81
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:12,961
Now, it is not a responsibility that either of us
would wish me to discharge

82
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,441
whilst I am in a bad temper.

83
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,401
Who's the minister talking to?

84
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:24,923
Perhaps you could help me. I can see that
you should know if he calls on an outsider.

85
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:31,486
I fail to see why you should be informed if he
just wants to, to take a hypothetical example,

86
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:35,088
to... check a point with... Dr Cartwright...

87
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,970
Thank you, Bernard. Must fly.

88
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,247
- Room 4017.
- I know.

89
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,131
Are those things about South Derbyshire true?

90
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,852
- They may be.
- What are you saying?

91
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:53,642
I'm saying that South Derbyshire is
the most efficient local authority in the UK.

92
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:58,283
- I'm meant to tick them off for being the least.
- Look at the figures.

93
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:02,445
- I thought they didn't send us any.
- No.

94
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:06,809
But they keep their own records
perfectly well. I'm going on those.

95
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:12,959
They've got the lowest truancy record
in the Midlands.

96
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:18,923
The lowest admin cost per council house. The
lowest ratio of council workers to rate income.

97
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:22,481
The lowest number
of environmental health officers.

98
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,247
- What are environmental health officers?
- Rat-catchers.

99
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,850
Virtually all children can read and write, even
though they've had a progressive education.

100
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:36,720
They've got the smallest establishment
of social workers in the UK.

101
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:41,283
- Is that supposed to be a good thing?
- Oh, yes. Sign of efficiency.

102
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:44,249
Parkinson's Law of Social Work, you see.

103
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:49,805
Social problems increase to occupy the number
of social workers available to deal with them.

104
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,841
- And all these figures are OK?
- Yes, I assure you.

105
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,001
Richard, I wonder if I...

106
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,042
Good heavens, Minister.

107
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:04,251
- Humphrey, what a coincidence.
- Yes, indeed, what a surprise!

108
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:06,606
- Yes.
- Yes.

109
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,841
I was just... passing.

110
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,050
- Passing?
- Yes, passing.

111
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:18,410
- Oh, passing. And where were you going?
- I was just going... past.

112
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:23,767
Past the door. Cartwright's... Richard's door.

113
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:27,242
And I thought..."Hello..."

114
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,280
Did you think anything further?

115
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:35,722
Yes, I thought, "Why should I pass
the door? Why not open it?"

116
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:40,361
- Good thinking, that's what doors are for.
- Right.

117
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,207
- There were some points I wanted to clear up.
- Oh, good, good. What points?

118
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:49,046
- Just a couple of odd points.
- Couple of odd points.

119
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:55,010
- How odd?
- Oh... not all that odd.

120
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:58,959
- We just had a meeting.
- Could I have a word with you?

121
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,329
- Yes, of course, as soon as...
- No, I mean now.

122
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:05,926
- All right, carry on.
- No, upstairs in your office.

123
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,890
- I'm sure Richard doesn't mind.
- No, upstairs.

124
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:15,046
I'm sure that Dr Cartwright can spare you for
a few moments. Thank you, Richard. Minister.

125
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,729
(LIFT PINGS)

126
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,682
You may go, Bernard.

127
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:51,044
- Minister, what was all that in aid of?
- I have learnt some interesting facts.

128
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,600
- I hope it does not happen again.
- I beg your pardon?

129
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:59,526
- You cannot speak to people in the department.
- Why not?

130
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,841
How can I advise you if I don't know what's said?

131
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,801
I must know what is going on.
You cannot have private conversations!

132
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,725
- You may be told things that are not true!
- You can put me right.

133
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,881
But they may be true!

134
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:19,528
Not entirely false, but misleading,
open to misinterpretation.

135
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:23,890
- You're trying to keep things from me.
- Absolutely not, Minister.

136
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:30,809
Minutes must be taken, records must be kept.
You won't be here for ever, nor will we.

137
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,921
In years to come... If Cartwright were moved
tomorrow, how could we check information?

138
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:41,082
- Cartwright won't be moved tomorrow.
- Oh, really?

139
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,211
- Alex Andrews from the Mail to see you.
- Ah, hang on. I'd like you to minute this.

140
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:53,162
Everything must be minuted, you know.
Sit down, won't you, Humphrey?

141
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,801
- Now... South Derbyshire Council...
- Just a minute.

142
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,042
Yes, that's what I said. South Derbyshire.

143
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:04,204
Dr Cartwright said
it is the most efficient council in Britain.

144
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,169
- Inefficient, I think he means.
- Efficient, Humphrey.

145
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:12,325
Economical, effective. Just not interested
in sending bits of blue paper to Whitehall.

146
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,881
- But they have to send them.
- Why?

147
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:20,443
- It is a statutory requirement.
- And if they don't, Britain carries on.

148
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:25,002
- South Derbyshire carries on.
- But if they don't send us the information,

149
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:29,528
the plans and the requests for permission,
well, what are we here for?

150
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:34,329
Good question. What ARE we here for?

151
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:39,086
To collate information, inspects plans,
and withhold or grant permission.

152
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:43,368
- And if we didn't?
- I'm sorry, Minister, I don't understand.

153
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,080
If we weren't here and we didn't do it,
what then?

154
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:52,961
- I'm sorry, you've lost me.
- You're concerned more with means than ends.

155
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:59,570
There are no ends in administration, Minister,
except loose ends. Administration is eternal!

156
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:03,247
- For ever and ever.
- (HUMPHREY AND BERNARD) Amen!

157
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,403
Because there are no ends,
they talk about government circles.

158
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:09,961
Exactly, Bernard,
which is what we're going round in!

159
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,760
I won't discipline South Derbyshire.
I'd look a complete idiot.

160
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,729
I'm sorry, Minister, but it's your job.

161
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,564
To discipline South Derbyshire.
You have no alternative.

162
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:27,966
- The Treasury and the Cabinet Office insist.
- I cannot agree to this. Not today, anyhow.

163
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,928
- Tomorrow, then.
- No!

164
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,399
I'm sorry, you don't seem to understand.

165
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:36,006
It is not up to you or to me. It is the law.

166
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,564
- Minister, I think you ought to talk to the Mail.
- Very well.

167
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,928
- Thank you, Humphrey.
- Thank you, Minister.

168
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,323
- Bernard. Bernard.
- Yes, Minister?

169
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:56,640
How did Sir Humphrey know
I was with Dr Cartwright?

170
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,086
God moves in a mysterious way.

171
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:06,966
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.
Humphrey is not God, OK?

172
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,560
Will you tell him or shall I?

173
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,845
Now, tell me how he knew where I was.

174
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,800
Confidentially, everything you tell me
is in complete confidence

175
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,682
so equally, and I'm sure you appreciate this,
and, by appreciate, I don't mean appreciate,

176
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,050
I mean understand, that everything
Sir Humphrey tells me is also in confidence,

177
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:39,127
as indeed everything I tell you and everything
I tell Sir Humphrey is in complete confidence.

178
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,323
So?

179
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:48,162
So, in confidence,
I am confident you understand

180
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:52,769
that for me to keep Sir Humphrey's confidence,
conversations between him and me

181
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,560
must be confidential, as confidential
as conversations between you and me

182
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,926
are completely confidential.

183
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,039
- Mr Andrews, Minister.
- Thank you, Bernard.

184
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:10,044
- Ah, Alex.
- Hello, Jim.

185
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,405
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

186
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,564
- What can I do for you?
- I need your help.

187
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,767
I've come across a fascinating story.

188
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:23,280
Do you realise that your government
is about to hand over £40 million-worth

189
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:29,321
of housing, building, harbour installations and
an airstrip to a private developer for nothing?

190
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:33,530
- £40 million?! You're having me on!
- No, Scout's honour.

191
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,323
- Why tell me? I didn't do it, did I?
- No.

192
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,403
It goes back a long way.

193
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:47,042
30 years ago, the Ministry of Defence
took out a lease on a Scottish island.

194
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:51,204
They put up billets, married quarters,
HQ block, the harbour, the airstrip.

195
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:56,923
And now the lease has expired, it reverts to the
original owner. He's opening up a holiday camp.

196
00:14:57,091 --> 00:15:01,403
Yachting marinas, chalets, staff quarters.
It's all there. He'll make a fortune.

197
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:05,769
- He can't do that. The law...
- No, you're talking about English law.

198
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,926
This contract was made under Scottish law.
Some idiot didn't realise the difference.

199
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:14,082
- We're in the clear.
- Ah, yes.

200
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:18,448
Even the Mail can't blame you
for a cock-up in the early '50s.

201
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,646
Makes a change.

202
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,803
What do you want from me?
You've got your story.

203
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,251
30 years late. As quick with the news
as ever! Still, not bad for Fleet Street!

204
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:33,961
We're running it tomorrow,
but my editor wants me to do a feature,

205
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,122
find out how it happened, go through the files.

206
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:39,850
- Why?
- There could be lessons for today.

207
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,127
We might find out who is responsible.

208
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:47,363
Does it matter? It would've been
handled by quite a junior official.

209
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,126
30 years ago.
Today he could be in an important position.

210
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:55,079
He could be a Permanent Secretary
running a great department,

211
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,801
responsible for spending billions of pounds
of public money.

212
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,363
- Pretty unlikely.
- Yes. But can I see the papers?

213
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:09,002
Of course, I can't just hand files over.
Didn't you say it was a 30-year lease?

214
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:13,323
You can get them from the Public Records Office
under the 30-year rule.

215
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:19,167
Yes, I thought you'd say that, but I want
a guarantee that I will get ALL of them.

216
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:23,484
- Well, Defence papers...
- Come on, this is not top security.

217
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:29,646
You made a manifesto commitment saying
you'd tell voters the facts. This is a test case.

218
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,850
I want your guarantee that no papers will be
removed from the file before it's opened.

219
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,002
I don't see why not. No skin off my nose.

220
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:43,767
Is that a promise? A REAL promise,
not the sort you put in your manifesto!

221
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,528
You know, the problem with you, Alex,
is you won't take yes for an answer!

222
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,207
Otherwise we do the feature about ministers
ratting on manifestos.

223
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,043
Is that the lot, Humphrey?

224
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:35,007
Oh, I'm sorry. That seems to be all,
Minister, thank you.

225
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:39,369
Incidentally, Humphrey, did you see
that story in the Mail this morning?

226
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:43,319
- About the Scottish island scandal.
- I'm not sure.

227
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:48,485
About some cock-up somebody made
30 years ago about the terms of the lease.

228
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,882
I believe I did glance at it.

229
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:54,964
£40 million down the tube!
Somebody really boobed there!

230
00:17:57,092 --> 00:18:00,288
- It didn't happen in your department?
- Absolutely not.

231
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,842
- I wonder who it was.
- That is something we shall never know.

232
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:10,132
It'll be on the files. Everything must be put
in writing, as you're always telling me.

233
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:17,681
Well... somewhere, no doubt, but it would take
ages to search. Not worth anyone's time.

234
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:21,447
You may be wrong.
The Mail want to do a big feature.

235
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:26,447
As soon as the papers are released
under the 30-year rule in a few weeks,

236
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:29,605
I promised them a free run of all the files.

237
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:35,250
- Minister!
- It's all right, isn't it?

238
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:38,962
All right? It most certainly is NOT all right!

239
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:42,328
- Why on earth not?
- It's impossible, it's unthinkable!

240
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,449
- Why?
- It's top security!

241
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,529
- A few barracks?
- Secret naval installations!

242
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,889
Anti-submarine systems! Low-level radar towers!

243
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:56,489
- You don't know that.
- That's the sort of thing those bases have.

244
00:18:56,652 --> 00:19:00,248
- But they'd have been dismantled.
- The papers will have references!

245
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,404
- Ancient history.
- We need to get clearances.

246
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,563
Who from?

247
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:09,520
Security implications! Ml5! Ml6!

248
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:13,525
Foreign powers! National interests!

249
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:19,005
Consult our allies! Top brass!
CIA, NATO, SEATO, Moscow!

250
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:27,331
- Moscow? Are you all right, Humphrey?
- Er, no, not Moscow. I didn't mean Moscow.

251
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:31,645
But this information could seriously damage
people still alive.

252
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,806
The people who drew up this contract
ought to be damaged!

253
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,806
Oh, absolutely! No question
of protecting officials! Of course not!

254
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,203
But... responsible ministers...

255
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:47,163
It's 30 years ago. In any case,
weren't the other lot in office then?

256
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,369
- Well, yes...
- Why are you so concerned?

257
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:58,170
Oh, I'm not, no, no. Not me, personally, but
it's the principle, the precedent, the policy...

258
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,802
The policy is up to me, Humphrey,
and I've said yes, so it's done. OK?

259
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:18,964
What's the matter with Humphrey?
I haven't done anything wrong, have I?

260
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:24,127
There aren't any security implications,
are there? What's the problem?

261
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:29,248
- Am I talking to myself?
- No, I'm listening.

262
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:33,882
- Why don't you answer?
- I thought your questions were purely rhetorical.

263
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:38,647
- I see no reason for him to be so anxious.
- Unless...

264
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:44,250
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I don't think so, Minister.

265
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,882
I'm not thinking anything, really.

266
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:53,011
- I begin to smell a rat.
- Shall I get an environmental health officer?

267
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,529
How long has Sir Humphrey been here
at Administrative Affairs?

268
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,286
- Since it was founded.
- When was that?

269
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:07,525
1964. The same time they started
the Department for Economic...

270
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:13,886
- Now I think I'm thinking what you're thinking.
- And what are you thinking?

271
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,886
You're thinking, where was he before 1964?

272
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:23,208
It'll be in "Who's Who". He must've been in
another department and trawled for the DAA.

273
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:26,967
- What?
- Trawled. You know, fished, caught in the net.

274
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,964
- Ah, here we are. Oh, my God!
- What?

275
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:37,322
From 1950 to 1956, he was
Assistant Principal at the Scottish Office.

276
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:41,931
On secondment from the War Office.

277
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,491
Ah.

278
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:47,764
Regional Contracts Officer.

279
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,047
30 years ago.

280
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:54,447
So the official...

281
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,842
...who chucked away £40 million...

282
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,810
...of taxpayers' money was...

283
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,846
How frightful!

284
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:09,850
- It's awful, Minister.
- Dreadful.

285
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:15,252
And all the papers due for release
in a few weeks' time.

286
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:21,409
- Get Humphrey to come back here at once.
- Yes, Minister.

287
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:29,288
The Minister wonders if Sir Humphrey could spare
time for a meeting sometime in the next few days.

288
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,650
- At once.
- In fact, sometime today is really...

289
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:36,806
- At once!
- Sometime during the next 60 seconds.

290
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,208
- He's coming round now.
- Why? Did he faint?

291
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:52,241
- No, he's just, you know...
- This is serious, Bernard.

292
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,324
Yes, I know.

293
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:59,882
- This is no laughing matter.
- No, certainly not.

294
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:10,563
The question is...

295
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,281
...how am I going to deal with it?

296
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,681
- In my opinion...
- The question was rhetorical.

297
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:25,802
- You wanted a word, Minister?
- Humphrey, come in, come in.

298
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,529
Sorry, Bernard.

299
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,645
(BERNARD CHUCKLES)

300
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,721
I've been thinking about
this Scottish island scandal.

301
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,964
- Very worrying.
- Well, I don't know...

302
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:51,444
You probably don't realise this, but that
official could still be in the Civil Service.

303
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,522
- Very unlikely.
- But why?

304
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:59,288
He could've been in his mid-20s then,
he'd be in his mid-50s now.

305
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:02,250
Might even be a Permanent Secretary!

306
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:06,409
- I hardly think...
- No, of course, you're right.

307
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:10,962
Nobody who made a blunder like that
could become a Permanent Secretary.

308
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:16,525
- Anyway, I want a full investigation.
- We can't find out that sort of thing.

309
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:21,891
But surely we can. I mean, you said yourself
that minutes are always made, records kept

310
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,850
in the Civil Service.

311
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:29,404
And legal documents concerning a current
contract wouldn't have been thrown away.

312
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:35,610
Minister... aren't we making
a little too much of this?

313
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:41,882
Possibly blighting a brilliant career
because of a... tiny slip 30 years ago?

314
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:47,364
- After all, it's not such a lot of money wasted.
- £40 million?

315
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,130
Well, not compared with Blue Streak,

316
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:54,761
TSR.2, Trident, Concorde,

317
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:57,366
high-rise council flats,

318
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:00,127
British Rail,

319
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:02,362
British Leyland, British Steel,

320
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:05,083
Upper Clyde Shipbuilders,

321
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:09,967
the atomic power station programme,
comprehensive schools,

322
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,520
the University of Essex.

323
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:18,489
I take your point, but it's still more,
a hundred times more,

324
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:22,043
than this official could ever have earned
in his entire career.

325
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:27,127
So I want you to look into it
and find out who it was.

326
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,690
OK?

327
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:41,922
- Yes, Humphrey?
- There is something you ought to know.

328
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,364
Yes, Humphrey?

329
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:51,243
The identity of the official whose alleged
responsibility for this hypothetical oversight,

330
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,880
as being the subject of recent discussion,

331
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,886
is not shrouded
in quite such impenetrable obscurity

332
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,690
as previous disclosures led you to assume.

333
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,844
But not to put too fine a point on it...

334
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:08,447
...the individual in question is,
it may surprise you to learn,

335
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:11,810
one whom your present interlocutor...

336
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:15,927
...is in the habit of defining...

337
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:20,011
...by means of the perpendicular pronoun.

338
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:27,563
I beg your pardon?

339
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,967
It was... I.

340
00:26:34,413 --> 00:26:36,208
Humphrey!

341
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:41,449
- No?
- I was under pressure!

342
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:48,529
We were overworked, there was panic!
Parliamentary questions tabled.

343
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:55,369
Obviously I'm not a trained lawyer or I wouldn't
have been in charge of the Legal Unit!

344
00:26:56,811 --> 00:27:02,922
- 30 years ago! Everybody makes mistakes!
- Well, Humphrey... I forgive you.

345
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,484
Oh, thank you, Minister.

346
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:14,647
Why didn't you tell me about this before?
We have no secrets from each other, have we?

347
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:20,491
- That is for you to say, Minister.
- Well, not entirely.

348
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,371
Anyhow, what are we going to do?

349
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:28,208
I'm going to be roasted if I don't release
all those papers to the Mail.

350
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:34,368
I might be able to do something about it...
if I hadn't got this other worry on my plate.

351
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:36,522
What other worry?

352
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:43,922
Being roasted by the press for disciplining
the most efficient council in Great Britain.

353
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:49,491
I've been thinking about South Derbyshire.

354
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:54,884
- Oh, good.
- Obviously we can't change the law.

355
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:59,330
Perhaps we might show them leniency -
a private word with the Chief Executive.

356
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:04,645
- Give them a chance to mend their ways.
- That might help considerably.

357
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:08,406
How will I explain the missing documents
to the Mail?

358
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:11,610
Well, this is what we normally do in...

359
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:15,284
...circumstances like these.

360
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:22,127
"This file contains the complete set of papers,
except for a number of secret documents,

361
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:25,284
"a few others which are part of still-active files,

362
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,286
"some correspondence
lost in the floods of 1967..."

363
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,802
Was 1967 a particularly bad winter?

364
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:40,886
No, a marvellous winter.
We lost no end of embarrassing files.

365
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:47,047
"...records lost in the move to London, or when
the War Office joined the Ministry of Defence,

366
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:50,806
"and the withdrawal of papers
that could give grounds for an action

367
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:55,967
"for libel or breach of confidence or cause
embarrassment to friendly governments."

368
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:02,212
Well, that's pretty comprehensive. How many
does that normally leave for them to look at?

369
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:06,806
How many does it actually leave?

370
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,565
About a hundred? Fifty?

371
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,561
Ten? Five?

372
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,449
Four?

373
00:29:16,612 --> 00:29:18,444
Three? Two?

374
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,882
One?

375
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,087
Zero?

376
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:28,571
Yes, Minister.

377
