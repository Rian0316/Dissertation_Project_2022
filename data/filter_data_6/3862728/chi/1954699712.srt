00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:04,366
嘿 你想听几首我重新填词
Hey, would you like to hear some songs

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:07,836
想激起孩子们对自然理论科学的兴趣的歌吗?
I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?

3
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:09,038
- 好啊  - 你没开玩笑?
- Sure.  - Really?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
当然 我喜欢音乐 也喜欢科学
Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science,

5
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:14,143
更喜欢嘲笑Sheldon 唱吧
I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.

00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:17,479
# 有个科学家 提出了理论 #

00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:28,057
# 他叫詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦 #

13
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,592
# 有个科学家 提出了理论 #
# There was a scientist who had a theory #

00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:36,865
好了 好了 我们... 懂了
Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we... we get it.

17
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,801

Perhaps you'd prefer this one.

18
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:43,138
# 可爱的蜘蛛 不是一只昆虫 #

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,007

21
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:51,780
- 真的很不错 Sheldon  - 谢谢
- That's pretty cool, Sheldon.  - Thank you.

22
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:54,116
你们认不认识碧昂斯?
Do either of you know Beyonce?

23
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:56,051
我想让她来唱这些歌
I'd love her to get behind it.

24
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,920
嘿
Hey.

25
00:00:57,922 --> 00:00:59,354
- 嘿  - 嘿 你好
- Hey.  - Hey. Hello.

26
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,323
你们知道国家航空航天局正在进行的
You guys know the new Discovery class missions

27
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,691
- 发现计划任务吗?  - 知道
- that NASA's been working on?  - Yeah.

28
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,927
他们想要加入一条"来自地球的信息"
Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth

29
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,705
万一能遇上外星生物呢
in case one of them is encountered by alien life.

30
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:08,363
哦
Oh.

31
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:10,365
我以前遇到外星生物的时候... 发现
When I encountered alien life, I... I discovered

32
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,902
关键是不能抢它的专座
that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.

33
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:17,673
{\an8}Leonard有哮喘

34
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:17,673
好吧 没有滤气器 你难以呼吸我们的空气
All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler,

35
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,475
他对地球坚果过敏
he's allergic to Earth nuts,

36
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:20,642
但我才是外星人
but I'm the alien.

37
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,644
反正
Anyway,

38
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,446
他们要求包括我在内的
I'm among a handful of scientists

39
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:26,782
几位科学家 上交一份信息内容
that have been asked to submit a design proposal

40
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,884
和传送系统的设计提案
for the message and its delivery system.

41
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,919
- 太棒了  - 恭喜 真为你高兴
- Excellent.  - Congratulations. Good for you.

42
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,988
我在想你们有没有兴趣
And I was wondering if any of you guys

43
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,890
来帮我一起做
would like to help me do it.

44
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:37,126
开什么玩笑? 当然愿意 你有什么想法?
Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?

45
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,895
我告诉你该做什么: 放弃人类
I'll tell you exactly what you should do: avoid the presumption

46
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:42,931
- 感知模式的设想  - 当然可以
- of the Terran sensory input paradigm.  - Yeah, absolutely.

47
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,800
你需要设计一个可以传递信息
You need a device capable of delivering information

48
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:47,569
给各种感知模式的设备
across a wide range of perceptual modalities.

49
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,172
任何有智慧的有机体都至少会拥有
Any intelligent organism would at the very least need

50
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,508
在空间中确认物体位置的能力
the ability to locate the position of objects in space.

51
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,345
所以理想的星际通用语言应该是触觉
So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.

52
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:58,447
一台可以跨感官传送信息的
Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged

53
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,115
3D触觉交流仪怎么样?
for cross-sensory transposition?

54
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,216
我早就料到了
Exactly what I expected.

55
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,918
两个人把想法强加于我
Two people forcing their ideas on me

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,820
只有一位绅士愿意问问
and only one gentleman who could be bothered

57
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:06,288
我有什么想法
to ask me what my thoughts were.

58
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,323
- 你们俩淘汰了  - 恭喜 Leonard
- You two are out.  - Congratulations, Leonard,

59
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,092
你入选小组了
you're on the team.

60
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,796
我妈妈教出了个绅士
My mommy raised a gentleman.

61
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:17,432
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

62
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:20,769
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

63
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,404
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

64
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:24,940
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

65
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,609
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

66
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:30,279
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

67
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,181
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

68
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,048
生活大爆炸 第八季第21集

嘿 谢谢你特地过来
Hey. Thanks for coming by.

73
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:46,517
不客气 我很乐意帮忙
Yeah. I'm excited to help.

74
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,252
我很想叫上他们俩 可是...
I would have included the others, but...

75
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,820
你很清楚会变成什么状况
you know exactly what would've happened.

76
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:52,256
他们会把项目抢过去 指使我们跑腿
They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.

77
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,724
我明白
I get it.

78
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:56,260
就今天早上 Sheldon不让我往提子脆麦片里
Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk

79
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,495
加杏仁牛奶 因为他说
on my Grape-Nuts because he said

80
00:02:57,497 --> 00:03:00,565
理论上讲两种坚果会冲突
it was a theoretical nut conflict.

81
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,934
你应该让他别多管闲事
You should have told him to mind his own business.

82
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:05,436
没错 总比我今天早上说的那句强
Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was,

83
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,206
"好吧 我就加苏打水得了"
"Fine, I'll eat them with club soda."

84
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,809
他们凭什么觉得自己能管所有事情?
What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?

85
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,977
他们是大哥
Mmm, they're alpha males.

86
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,579
那我们算什么?
What does that make us?

87
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,714
我们也许是二哥 就是二把手
We could be betas. They're second in charge.

88
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:17,682
好吧 听上去不错
Okay, that sounds good.

89
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:18,916
或许我们是小弟
Or we could be omegas.

90
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:21,686
他们会被大哥和二哥呼来喝去
They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.

91
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,021
好吧 听上去就是我们的状况
Okay, that sounds like us.

92
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:26,290
无所谓了 这里没大哥
Whatever. There's no alphas here,

93
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,092
这是你的项目
and this is your project.

94
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:30,161
你是管事的 想怎么开工?
You're in charge. How do you want to start?

95
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,197
我不知道 你想怎么开工?
I don't know. How do you want to start?

96
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,467
我也不知道
I don't know.

97
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,306
我们应该打电话给Sheldon和Howard吗?
Should we call Sheldon and Howard?

98
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,975
不 我们靠自己可以做到
No. We can do this by ourselves.

99
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:45,710
嗯 很好 你想怎么开工?
Okay. Great. How do you want to start?

100
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:47,311
我不知道 你想怎么开工?
I don't know. How do you want to start?

101
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,986
Sheldon开门 Sheldon开门
Sheldon. Sheldon.

102
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,154
Sheldon开门
Sheldon.

103
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:06,364
我猜你一开始是打算开个玩笑
I bet that started off as a joke,

104
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,000
但叫到第三遍的时候
but by the third one you realized

105
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:12,703
你发现自己神奇般的很享受这过程
there was something strangely enjoyable about it.

106
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:16,207
对 我有点想再来一次
Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.

107
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,909
我不推荐 你今后会这样敲门一辈子的
I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life.

108
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,514
如果你来找Leonard 他在Koothrappali家
Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.

109
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,149
不 其实我是来找你谈谈的
Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.

110
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,585
真不错
How nice.

111
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,588
以下是我感兴趣的话题:
Here are some topics that interest me:

112
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,858
- 量子力学 火车 旗子...  - 不 不是
- quantum mechanics, trains, flags...  - No, no.

113
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,227
- 我是想谈谈我的演艺事业  - 抱歉
- It's about my acting career.  - Oh, sorry.

114
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,528
此话题不在清单里
That's not on the list.

115
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,196
- 那...  - 等等 不对
- Well...  - Oh, wait. No.

116
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:40,364
要不我们先
How about we split

117
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:43,367
撇开差异 谈谈为什么奥地利
the difference and discuss why Austria

118
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:47,038
是个大公国 而非传统的公爵领地
was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,041
好吧 听着 事情是这样的 我很喜欢医药销售...
Okay, look, here's the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales...

120
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,343
工作也很顺利... 但我有个电影试镜
it's going great... but I have an audition for a movie,

121
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,378
如果我选上了 可能会搞砸一切
and if I get it, it could screw everything up.

122
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,648
嗯 我知道你该做什么了
Hmm. I know exactly what you should do.

123
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,084
不幸的是 我不能告诉你
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,587
为什么?
Well, why? 

125
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,589
我想要重新开始
I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf.

126
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,358
今天早些时候 有人向我指出
Earlier today, it was pointed out to me

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,960
我总想把想法强加于人
that I tend to force my ideas on people.

128
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,331
你真的不打算告诉我?
You're really not gonna tell me?

129
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,567
不 时机已经过了
No, that train has left the station.

130
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:17,835
听着 我们可以
Now, we can play this

131
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,036
用两种方法解决
one of two ways.

132
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,806
你可以说"火车火车 告诉我"
You can say, "Trains, tell me more,"

133
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:22,907
或者...
or...

134
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:25,042
你可以一直那么看着我
you can just look at me like that

135
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,911
我就会说了
and I'll start.

136
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,683
你在做什么?
What's going on in here?

137
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:35,619
我在做分子鸡尾酒
I am making molecular cocktails.

138
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:39,390
这个小球其实是杯"大都会"
This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.

139
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,524
哦
Oh.

140
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:41,726
那要怎么喝?
How do you drink it?

141
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:44,829
直接放进嘴里 噗嗤一下含碎就行了
Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,499
我想我还是喝啤酒好了
I think I'll have a beer.

143
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,967
先和我拍张照片
First take a picture with me.

144
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:50,752
为什么?
Why?

145
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:53,036
我和Raj一直说要一起
Well, Raj and I always talked about learning

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,441
学怎么做这样的鸡尾酒 所以我自学完
how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself

147
00:05:57,443 --> 00:06:00,244
把这照片发到Instagram上 让他看着
and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it

148
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:03,748
SB了吧 茄子
and feel like a turd. Say cheese.

149
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,517
是因为他研究宇宙探测仪却没带上你吗?
Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?

150
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,085
真聪明 猜中了
You betcha. The very one.

151
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:11,489
Howard 你是个成年人
Howard, you're grown men.

152
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,591
你们不必什么事都在一起做
You guys don't have to do everything together.

153
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:17,561
我知道 所以我今晚和你待在一起啊
I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.

154
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:19,697
就是为了让Raj不爽
Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

155
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,799
和亲爱的在一起
With my honeybunch.

156
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:24,535
你这样很幼稚
You're being childish.

157
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:26,404
不 他才是
No. He is.

158
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,706
是啊我这个人比较有支配欲
So I have a dominant personality.

159
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,641
这点大家都知道
We all know that.

160
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:34,044
不好意思 大家都知道什么?
I'm sorry. What do we know?

161
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,013
在社交圈子里
In social groupings,

162
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:40,217
最后总是自然而然由我说了算
I just naturally wind up in charge.

163
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,153
别误会啊 但是我问你下
Don't take this the wrong way, but how many

164
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:44,622
这些酒珠你都喝了多少了?
of these little booze balls have you had?

165
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,258
你不觉得我是人群里的领导者吗?
You don't think I'm a leader?

166
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,727
我开玩笑的 你当然是啊
I was kidding. Of course you are.

167
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,929
对啊 想改也改不了
Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.

168
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:55,065
你最好不要改变 因为我喜欢你现在的样子
You better not change, because I love who you are.

169
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,668
你喝完以后需不需要我帮忙把这收拾下
Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done

170
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,637
还是你可以自己一个人全部做完?
or can you do it all by yourself?

171
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,172
我自己全部做完
All by myself.

172
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,474
真是我的好领导
There's my big boss man.

173
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:10,381
所以 在火车头的前面通常
So, often on the front of the locomotive

174
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:13,384
是一个铁制的楔子
is a large iron wedge

175
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,786
用来把轨道上的物体清除
for clearing objects off the tracks.

176
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:18,556
尽管大家普遍认为它是机车排障器
Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher,

177
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:22,560
我更喜欢"排牛爆炸器"这种更精确的叫法
I prefer the more accurate "cow exploder"

178
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:26,530
好 Sheldon 我问你个问题
Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.

179
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,732
嗯 如果我在一个火车站
Mmm. If I was at a train station

180
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:31,335
其中一辆火车通往我现在的工作
and one train could take me to my current job

181
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:34,371
而另一辆能带我去一部电影的面试
and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie,

182
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:36,740
我应该上哪辆车?
which train should I get on?

183
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:44,081
你是想用火车的梗骗我给你建议吧?
Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?

184
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,750
不是
No.

185
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,386
那 好吧 
All right, then.

186
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,655
你应该坐上第三辆火车
You should take a third train

187
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:53,991
它能带你去试镜
where you audition for the movie

188
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,026
但是你可以晚一些再做职业上的抉择
but hold off on making a career decision

189
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,862
直到你有更多的信息为止
until you have more information.

190
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,530
哦 你说得对
Oh. You're right.

191
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,932
我在担心一些甚至还没发生的事情
I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet.

192
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,300
哈
Huh.

193
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:06,036
你真是个智者
You are a wise man.

194
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,205
嗯 Penny 哪个人更聪明：是那个智者
Well, Penny, who's smarter: the wise man

195
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:12,576
还是那个向他寻求建议的人?
or the person who comes to him for advice?

196
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,346
哦 我想你是对的
Oh, I guess you're right.

197
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,581
大概是那个求建议的人
Maybe it is the person who asks.

198
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,050
不 是那个智者
No, it's the wise man.

199
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:26,757
所以他才被称为智者
That's why he's called the wise man.

200
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,126
你知道我怎么知道的吗?
You know how I know that?

201
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,595
我就是智者啊
I'm the wise man.

202
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,932
不好意思 我刚刚在想什么?
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

203
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,500
呃 只是好奇哈
Uh, just out of curiosity,

204
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,567
你为什么不问Leonard对这事的建议?
why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?

205
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,471
因为我都知道他会说啥
'Cause I already know what he'll say.

206
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:43,507
哇 哇 哇 你不该这么干
Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it.

207
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,943
学得太像了!
It's just like he's here!

208
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,414
好的 所以我们了解到之前尝试
Okay, so we know that previous attempts

209
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,583
向太空中发送消息的方式 比如旅行者上的金唱片
to send a message into space, like the Golden Record

210
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,785
这类尝试受到了严厉的批判
on Voyager, were heavily criticized.

211
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,387
嗯 让外星人播放唱片
Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record

212
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,389
他们还得先造出个唱片机
if they figured out how to build a record player.

213
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:01,725
不过 说句实在的 E.T.造出了个电话
Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone

214
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:04,094
用的是拼读玩具和一把雨伞
out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella.

215
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:08,098
那家伙就像一个迷你棕色版的发明大王
Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.

216
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,301
如果E.T.是真的 你这话就更有用了
That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.

217
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:15,406
嗯 他快死的时候我的感情确实很真实
Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.

218
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:19,877
天啊 他躺在桌上 浑身都靠板子维持着
My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.

219
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,211
他全身都白了
And he's all white.

220
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,980
他们把他放进袋子里拉上拉链
They zip him up in that bag.

221
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,716
Gertie哭个不停
And Gertie can't stop crying.

222
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,451
花也谢了
The flower dies.

223
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,887
行 我们说些别的吧 
Okay, let's talk about something else.

224
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:32,256
好 好 所以这... 这听起来
All right, all right. So it... it sounds

225
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:34,725
似乎我们需要一种简便的沟通方式
like we need a way to communicate that's simple.

226
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,727
并且不需要造出其他机器
And doesn't require outside machinery

227
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:38,195
去接收它
to be built to access it.

228
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,230
还存在问题的是我们甚至不知道
It's also a problem because we don't even know

229
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:41,999
找到它的外星人有没有视觉
if the aliens who find this can see.

230
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,200
他们沟通的方式
I mean, they might communicate

231
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:44,902
可能和我们完全不一样
in a totally different way than us.

232
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:46,870
就像当我的小狗对我生气的时候
Like when my dog is mad at me,

233
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,773
她会用在我的拖鞋里尿尿这种方式表达
she tells me by peeing in my slippers.

234
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,277
那实际上是个很不错的例子
That's actually a valid example.

235
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,946
动物确实会通过气味传递信息
Animals do deliver messages through scent.

236
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,715
蜜蜂用跳舞的方式相互沟通
Bees talk to each other by dancing.

237
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:58,882
鲸鱼也有属于它们的歌声
Whales have their songs.

238
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:01,485
Penny有20多种翻白眼的方式
Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling her eyes

239
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,621
每一种意思都不一样的
that each mean something different.

240
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:06,123
好的 所以 听起来是这样的
Okay, so, what it sounds like is,

241
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,458
我们需要的是一种装置
what we want is a device

242
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,593
不仅通过视觉传递信息
that can deliver a message through not only sight,

243
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,995
还通过其他的感官
but other senses, as well.

244
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:14,164
任何一个探索太空的文明所必须具备的感官里
The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization

245
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,233
最基础的就是触觉
would have to possess is touch.

246
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,268
哦 哦 哦!
Ooh. Ooh, ooh!

247
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,504
我们可以造一个视频播放装置
We could make a video-playing device

248
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:22,606
它可以同时将信息转化成
that simultaneously translates the information

249
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:24,341
一种可接触的介质
into a tactile medium.

250
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:26,977
我们所需做的就是建一个3D的交流系统!
All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system!

251
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:28,078
我们... 我们完全可以做到!
We... we can totally do that!

252
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,747
我知道啊! 太棒了!
I know! This is great!

253
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:30,914
- 嗯 这还是什么?  - 什么?
Yeah, you know what else it is?--  What?

254
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,716
这完全就是Sheldon和Howard所说的
Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.

255
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,688
嗯 谢谢你在我的拖鞋里尿尿
Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.

256
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:48,172
# 它是老虎的眼睛 #
# It's the eye of the tiger #

257
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,308
# 它是蝙蝠的耳朵 #
# It's the ear of the bat #

258
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,677
# 它是鲶鱼的胡须 #
# It's the whiskers of the catfish #

259
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,513
# 还有海象... #
# And the walrus... #

260
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:59,951
等等 并不是说你的歌不糟糕... 是...
Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible... it is...

261
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,789
但是你怎么能提到了蝙蝠却把声纳给忘了呢?
but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?

262
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,724
你没让我唱完
You didn't let me finish.

263
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:10,761
# 至于蝙蝠呢 #
# And also regarding the bat #

264
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,097
# 它有声纳啊 #
# It has sonar #

265
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,100
嘿
Hey.

266
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:17,235
嘿
Hello.

267
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:19,403
听着
Look,

268
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,406
我知道你俩挺沮丧的 但我们已经讨论过了
I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it,

269
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:23,941
我们认为这样会比较有利
and we think it'd be beneficial

270
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,244
就是你们能加入我们的项目
for you to be part of the project.

271
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:30,681
哇 哇 哇 Sheldon 你听到了吗? 
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?

272
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:33,150
不好意思 我刚刚在想什么韵
I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes

273
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,786
会和"非洲食蚁兽的鼻子"押上
with "nose of the aardvark."

274
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,121
我们需要你们
We want you

275
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:39,223
和我们一起做这个项目
back on the project with us.

276
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:44,295
哇 哇 哇 Howard 你听到了吗? 
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?

277
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:45,563
听着 我们得承认
Look, we admit it.

278
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:48,099
你俩想出的点子非常不错
The idea that you guys came up with was really good,

279
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,101
我们需要你们的帮助
and I'd love your help.

280
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:53,104
我想你要说出这话还挺不容易的
I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.

281
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,207
确实不容易 所以... 你们加入吗?
It wasn't, so... are you in?

282
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,143
- 当然  - 太好了
- Certainly. Sure.  - Great.

283
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,445
既然我们已经达成共识了
Now that we're all on the same page,

284
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,247
我们就今晚聚在一起开始着手做吧
let's get together tonight and work on it.

285
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:04,448
"今晚聚在一起"?
"Get together tonight"?

286
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,916
Leonard 你别什么事都要说了算
Leonard, stop trying to control everything,

287
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,619
给可怜的Raj一次机会让他想想我们该干啥
and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do.

288
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:09,720
说吧 Raj
Go ahead, Raj.

289
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,622
好 我认为我应该现在就开始
Okay, I think we should do it right now.

290
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,024
今晚对我更合适
Tonight works better for me.

291
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,459
好
Okay.

292
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,601
好 就是个试镜而已
Okay, it's just an audition.

293
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:25,269
我为什么要紧张?
Why am I nervous?

294
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,637
可能是好事吧
Maybe it's a good thing.

295
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,539
代表我很想搞定它
Just means I want it.

296
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,107
而且我也可以搞定
And I can have it.

297
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,542
这种感觉太好了
This feels right.

298
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,744
我之前为什么要放弃?
Why did I ever give this up?

299
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,085
我大概想起来了
I'm starting to remember.

300
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,890
所以 我想尝试一种新的方式
So, I'd like to try a technique

301
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,558
没人会觉得自己被碾压
where no one gets steamrolled.

302
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,093
在你说话的时候
When you talk,

303
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:52,029
你并不是提出新的观点 而是就之前所说的话
instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was

304
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,865
进行拓展和延伸
just said by building on it.

305
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,600
呃 说到这...
Uh, building on that...

306
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:59,203
我们该订外卖了
we should order dinner.

307
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,505
这和他刚刚说的有什么关系?
How is that building on what he just said?

308
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:05,009
既然Sheldon说到这里 我觉得我们可以吃中餐
Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.

309
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,744
等等 就像Leonard说的那样
Hang on. Building on what Leonard said,

310
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,145
没人是在继续我的话题
no one built on what I said.

311
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,081
根据 "新的话题要延续之前的话题"这一条
Building on "building on that"

312
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,416
Colorado路上新开了一家自选披萨店
there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.

313
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:14,985
说到这里 我想提醒你一句
Building on that, I'd like to remind you,

314
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,087
我有乳糖不耐症
I'm lactose intolerant.

315
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,822
我看过菜单了 他们有豆奶干酪
I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.

316
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,257
哈哈! 你没有说"根据" 你输了!
Ha, ha! You didn't say "building on." You're out!

317
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,959
这又不是造句的游戏
It's not Simon Says.

318
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:23,728
- 是啊 Sheldon你的重点错了  - 你们俩都输了
- Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.  - You're out, and you're out.

319
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,229
我赢了! 谁想吃披萨?
I win! Who wants pizza?

320
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,102
是你啊 Penny?
Penny?

321
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,470
- 哦 嗨  - 嗨
- Oh, hey.  - Hey.

322
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,372
好久没见你参加试镜了
I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.

323
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,141
是啊 我现在在一家药厂做销售代表
Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

324
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,243
- 你退出演艺圈了?  - 算是吧
- You quit acting?  - Well, kind of.

325
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,711
不过我现在可以信口雌黄
But now I get to act like

326
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:44,548
说心口灼热只算是"轻微的副作用"
inflamed heart is only a "mild side effect."

327
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,751
听说你现在的工作能挣不少钱
I heard you can make good money doing that.

328
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:49,620
是啊 确实还好 不过有时候我也挺怀念这种感觉的
Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.

329
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,155
- 真的吗?  - 是啊
- Really?  - Mmm.

330
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:53,491
说实话 我都快吐了
Because I got to tell you, I am so sick

331
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,527
每天这样像市场里的猪肉一样被人挑肥拣瘦
of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.

332
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,563
- Chelsea?  - 祝我好运吧
- Chelsea?  - Wish me luck. 

333
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,467
他们会选中你的
They're gonna love you.

334
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:07,738
我听说她都快四十了 全靠整容才能继续演戏
I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.

335
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,941
其实 这谣言是我造的
Yeah. I started that rumor.

336
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,813
好吧 既然我们已经就发送信息的系统
Okay, since we agree on the delivery system

337
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,481
达成了共识 我们是不是应该谈谈
for the message, maybe we should talk

338
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,749
到底应该发送什么信息
about what the message could be.

339
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,519
我觉得我们应该展示出地球生物的样子
Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.

340
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,054
他们发射到太空的先驱者镀金铝板上有一幅画
The plaque they sent up on the <i>Pioneer</i> probe had a drawing

341
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,790
画上是躶体的男女
of a naked man and woman on it.

342
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,191
是嘛 我向来就不喜欢那个
Yeah, I never cared for that.

343
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,693
这简直就是在向外星捕食者
It's advertising to predator races

344
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:33,597
展示我们鲜嫩柔软的口感
just how soft and squishy we are.

345
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,633
捏你自己去!
Squeeze yourself!

346
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:36,867
我没有冒犯你的意思
Oh, don't be offended.

347
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,469
你也知道 我们四个里面
You know, of the four of us,

348
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,471
你的质感最像小牛肉了
you have the most veal-like consistency.

349
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,475
好吧 应该有办法能让我们显得既不那么有攻击性
Well, maybe there's a way to appear nonaggressive,

350
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,977
又能在必要的时候有能力保护自己
but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary.

351
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:49,513
比如微笑着 并且用一只手挥手致意
Like smiling and waving with one hand,

352
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,883
而另一只手拎着一颗老虎的脑袋之类的
but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.

353
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,885
你想向外星人发送
You want to send a passive-aggressive message

354
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,053
消极攻击的信息?
out into the universe?

355
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,254
这太扯了
That's ridiculous.

356
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:58,789
你说的消极攻击
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive

357
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,825
是把你和你老婆一起吃大都会酒球的照片
like posting pictures of you and your wife

358
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,026
发在网上 而你明明知道
eating cosmopolitan balls

359
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:04,895
那球是属于我的吗?
that you know belong in my mouth?

360
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,766
可能Howard所说的消极攻击指的是
Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive

361
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,402
你让我们一起帮你做这个项目
like asking our group to help on your project,

362
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,103
可是只选了Leonard和你一起做
and then only choosing Leonard.

363
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:15,973
对不起 我让你们不开心了
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,

364
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,476
可是你们确实有点太强势了
but you do have strong personalities

365
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:20,411
永远都是你们在做决定
and always end up taking over.

366
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,712
也不总是吧
It's not always.

367
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,514
我们去参加漫展
What about when we went to Comic-Con

368
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:25,015
打扮成赫特族人贾巴(星球大战中角色)的时候呢? 
and dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

369
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,518
你当贾巴的脑袋 我就得当
You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be

370
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
他的大肥屁股
his fat slug butt.

371
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,958
那次成果相当不错
We looked great.

372
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,093
你们还让别人坐在我身上
You let a guy sit on me.

373
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,761
他扮的是莉亚公主(星球大战中角色)
He was dressed as Princess Leia.

374
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,830
拍照很合适
It made a nice picture.

375
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:45,102
我的意思是 有时候Raj和我会觉得被无视了
I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.

376
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,671
是啊 你开车带Sheldon去德州
Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas

377
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,139
参观NASA的那次...
and showed him all around NASA...

378
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,375
你连问都没问我和Leonard
you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.

379
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,344
你说的有道理啊
You know what? You're right.

380
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,045
我应该问问你们的
I should have asked you.

381
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,248
是啊 如果他真的邀请你们的话 一定要去
Yeah, and if he does ask you, go.

382
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,216
那里棒呆了
It's amazing.

383
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,719
好吧 要是说起来
Okay, and if we're talking

384
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,187
被抛弃什么的
about being left out of things,

385
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,189
{\an8}(星球大战导演George Lucas 的住处)

386
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,189
你们去天桥庄园的那次也没带我们啊
you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.

387
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:06,590
哦 那里也不错
Oh, I recommend that, too.

388
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,959
简直是传奇之旅!
That was a magical experience!

389
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,394
等等
Wait a minute.

390
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:12,630
{\an8}(著名演员 星球大战黑武士配音演员)

391
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:12,630
有一次Sheldon和James Earl Jones待了一整天
Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones

392
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:13,898
我们谁都不知道
and never told any of us.

393
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,766
是啊是啊
I sure did.

394
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,201
天啊!
Oh, my goodness!

395
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:20,437
当了贾巴的头还和"黑武士"一起吃了冰激凌
Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader,

396
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,673
我的人生简直精彩
I'm having a heck of a ride.

397
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:23,707
是啊 你们看
Yeah, look,

398
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,075
我做决定的时候
clearly, good things happen

399
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,477
总能有好事发生
when I'm in charge.

400
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,745
现在 
Now, why don't

401
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:30,748
不如你们都让开 让我一个人搞定这个项目怎么样?
you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?

402
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,916
嘿 Sheldon
Sheldon,

403
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,083
这事不是你说了算
you're not in charge.

404
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:34,385
Raj说了算
Raj is in charge.

405
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,520
Leonard 到底是谁负责?
Leonard, who's really in charge?

406
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:41,125
是所谓负责的人 还是让他去负责的那个人?
The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?

407
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,426
他说得对
He's right.

408
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,662
仔细想想 我们都是负责的人
If you think about it, we're all in charge.

409
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,196
不是 真正负责的人应该是...
No, the guy in charge is in...

410
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,166
为什么你们就听不懂啊?!
Why is everyone so bad at these?!

411
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,102
这次的经历让我想起来了
I mean, the whole experience reminded me

412
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,305
我有多痛恨那种生活
about how much I hated about that world.

413
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:56,674
你们... 你们懂的 那种焦虑 抑郁 还有负面情绪
You... you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity.

414
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,676
我不想再去经历那种感受了
I don't want to feel those things.

415
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:02,913
我想把药卖给有这种感受的人吃
I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.

416
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,215
真不敢相信你居然就这样起身离开了
I can't believe you got up and walked out

417
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:07,418
一部大片的试镜
of an audition for a big movie.

418
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,686
没错
I did.

419
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,521
其实我... 我还是进去了的 还试读了台词
I... I mean, I walked in, read for the part,

420
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,957
搞砸了整个试镜 然后就头也不回地走了
then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.

421
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,059
我很高兴
Well, I'm glad

422
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,094
你对你的工作更上心了
you have a new appreciation for your job.

423
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,862
是啊 而且我好像
I do, and you know, I don't think

424
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:20,965
还没正式谢谢你 帮我找到了这么好的工作呢
I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.

425
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,733
正式不正式 有没有
Properly, at all.

426
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,869
反正我都没听过
It's just words I've never heard.

427
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,004
好吧 谢谢你啦
Well, thank you.

428
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,139
你是个称职的好朋友 你改变了我的生活
You're a good friend, and you changed my life.

429
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:30,708
不用谢
You're welcome.

430
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,376
既然你现在挣了不少钱了
Hey, now that you're making some real money,

431
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:34,878
是不是该请我这个帮过你的朋友吃顿好的啊
maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.

432
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,414
没问题
Sure.

433
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,216
你大概也应该请你的另一个朋友一起去
And you probably have to invite your other friend

434
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,618
因为她已经听到你说要请人吃饭了
'cause she overheard you talking about it,

435
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,686
不请她的话 她会觉得尴尬的
and it would be awkward to exclude her.

436
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,622
好吧
Okay.

437
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:45,723
现在就走吧?
How about now?

438
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,992
听你的
All right.

439
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:51,695
别忘带钱包
Don't forget your wallet.

440
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,864
我...
I... 

441
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:07,122
请接收来自地球的问候
Greetings from planet Earth.

442
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:10,826
在半人马阿尔法行星处左拐
Just turn left at Alpha Centauri.

443
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,861
一定能找到我们的
