1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:02,382
Previously On...

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:04,988
Lynette Dallied
With Temptation...

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,481
Are You Sleeping
With My Wife?

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,550
Carlos Struggled
With His New Life...

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,988
I Am Poor, And I Am Blind,
And There Is Nothing About That

6
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,140
That Is Your Type.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,850
Bree Found Herself
With A New Rival...

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,813
Bree, That Is, Like,
The Best Pie You've Ever Made.

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,335
This Is Not My Pie.

10
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,925
Okay, You Caught Me.
It's Mine.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,113
And Susan Made The Best
Of Having Houseguests.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,425
Oh, And, Listen,
Bob And Lee Introduced U

13
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,753
To This Wonderful Contractor,

14
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:35,503
So We Won't Be Imposing
For Long.

15
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,628
Imposing? Who's Imposing?

16
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,550
You Can Stay
As Long As You Want.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,850

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,628
In A Corridor

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,561
Of The Greenwood
Rehabilitation Center

20
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,761
Is A Sign.

21
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:54,828
It's There To Remind Patients
To Be Honest About The Past.

22
00:00:57,027 --> 00:01:00,094
But Orson Hodge
Did Not Notice It.

23
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,394
He Was Too Busy
Thinking Of S Past,

24
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:07,862
Or At Least The Part Of It
He Shared With Mike Delfino.

25
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,127
Orson Thought
Of The Night They Met-

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,094
The Night His Mother...

27
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,327
Had Murdered His Mistress.

28
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,528
He Thought
Of The Next Timehey Met

29
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:28,594
And How Mike
Began To Recognize Him.

30
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:37,461
He Thought Of His Mother's Fear
Mike Would Remember Too Much

31
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:41,550
And Her Demand That Orson
Stop This From Happening.

32
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,461
He Thought Of How He Agonized,

33
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,160
But In The End,

34
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,728
Had Still...

35
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:52,027
Done The Unthinkable.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,828
Orsothen Started To Think

37
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,327
About The Message
He Had Received From Mike,

38
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:03,628
Asking Him To Visit.

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,094
The Thought
Was Crossing Orson's Mind

40
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,861
That Mike Had
Remembered Something-

41
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,194
Something Dangerous,

42
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,094
When Suddenly...

43
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,694
Orson. Come On In.

44
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:22,461
The Time For Thinking
Was Over.

45
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,909
So I-I See Ty Have
A Tennis Court Here.

46
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,394
Must Be Nice To Get Out

47
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:34,175
And Whack
A Few Balls Around, Huh?

48
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:36,182
Why Don't You Sit Down?

49
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,128
It Might Make This Easier.

50
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,503
I've Been Trying
To Figure Out All Day

51
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,690
Just How
I Was Gonna Do This.

52
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,471
Do What, Mike?

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,443
Since I've Come Here, I've Had
A Lot Of Time To Think.

54
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,613
Things Are...
Becoming Clearer.

55
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,690
I'm Starting To Put
Some Things Togeth.

56
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,628
Oh?

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,044
Well, Good For You.

58
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,050
No, Not Really, Orson.

59
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,316
When You Hurt People,

60
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,737
You Gotta Be Accountable.

61
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,738
There's No Way Around It.

62
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,612
So I Have To Ask You...

63
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,550
Do You Think
You Can Forge Me?

64
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,112
What?

65
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,738
When I Asked You To Write
A Prescription For Pain Pills,

66
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,562
It... All I Could Think About
Was Getting My Next Fix.

67
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,359
The Fact That You Could Have
Lost Your License,

68
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,238
Your Business-All That
Never Even Entered My Head.

69
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,238
And I Am... Really Sorry.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,175
Oh.

71
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,300
Of Course.

72
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,175
No Need To Apologize.

73
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:03,300
Wow. I-I Feel
A Million Times Better.

74
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,437
You Know, One Thing
I've Learned Here-

75
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,516
If You Don't Get This Stuff
Off Your Chest,

76
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,316
It'll Eat You Alive.

77
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:15,613
As He Left,

78
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,987
Orson Thought Only
Of His Good Fortune And Relief,

79
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,594
Ignoring Completely

80
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:26,362
The Feelings Of Guilt And Shame
That Were Rising Within Him.

81
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,862
That Was The Sad Thing
About Orson Hodge...

82
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,596
He Had No Idea

83
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:37,925
Just How Sick He Reay Was.

00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:53,050
From The Moment His Doctors
Had Told Him He Was Blind,

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,175
Carlos Solis Had Worried
About Only One Thing-

88
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,238
That The People In His Life

89
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:03,582
Would Come To See Him
As A Burden.

90
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,987
But As It Turned Out,

91
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,347
His Friends Didn't Mind
Driving Him To The Store.

92
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,691
His Neighbors Didn't Mind
Helping Retrieve His Mail.

93
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,438
The Paper Boy Didn't Mind

94
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:20,612
Helping Him Find
His Morning Paper.

95
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,000
In Truth,

96
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,000
Everyone On Wisteria Lane
Was More Than Willing

97
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,941
To Help Caos
Adjust To Fe As A Blind Man-

98
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,988
Everyone, That Is...

99
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,469
But His Wife,

100
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,362
Who Was
Quickly Starting To Feel

101
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:38,000
She Was The One
With The Handicap.

102
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,828
"And In A Surprise Move,
The Spurs Announced A Trade

103
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,269
That Will Send
Perennial All-Star To The... "

104
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,972
Oh, Jeez, Gaby.

105
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:49,268
I Asked You To Please Fish Out
All The Little Carrot Squares.

106
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,328
I Did.
Well, I Think You Missed Some.

107
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,831
Could You Get 'Em Out,
Please?

108
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,690
There You Go. All Gone.

109
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,175
Did You Just Use Your Hand?
Of Course Not. I Us A Spoon.

110
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,878
I'm Sorry
That I'm Such A Handful.

111
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,328
I Really Am Trying To Do
The Best That I Can.

112
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:18,438
I Know You Are, Babe.
And I Know It's Hard,

113
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,160
And I'm Gonna Try To Be
More Sensitive To Your Needs.

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,050
Now Hurry Up And Finish.
I Have To Go To The Store.

115
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,750
Could I Go, Too?
I'm Bored.

116
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,878
Oh, Please, Carlos.
I Have A Million Errands To Run,

117
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,999
And I'd Do It
A Lot Faster Without You.

118
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,863
Plus I'm Having Lunch
With The Girls First.

119
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,675
Oh, Okay.

120
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,999
Mm. Gaby, Another Carrot.

121
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,847
Just Eat Them.
Carrots Are Good For Your...

122
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,160
Just Eat Them.

123
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,503
Sorry I'm Late. Blind Husband.
You Know The Drill.

124
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,203
Oh, Gaby,
I'm So Glad You're Here.

125
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:56,238
I Was Just About To Tell
Everyone To Keep An Eye Out

126
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:59,191
For Their Invitation
To The Founder's Ball.

127
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:02,628
I'm Sorry.
What Is The Founder's Ball?

128
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,265
You All Seem So Excited.

129
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:07,063
It's A Black-Tie Fund-Raiser
That Bree Organizes Every Year.

130
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:10,362
It's A Lot Of Work, Exhausting
And Completely Worth It.

131
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,140
Especially When You Get Your
Big Moment In The Spotlight.

132
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,363
Bree Gets To Present An Award

133
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:17,815
To Somebody Who's Done Something
Extraordinary For The Community.

134
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,613
Ooh, I Say We Nominate The Woman
Who Gives Edie Her Bikini Wax.

135
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,238
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,191
So, Bree,

137
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,612
I've Planned A Few Events
Myself Back In Chicago.

138
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,453
Small Potatoes Compared
To This, I'm Sure,

139
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:33,378
But If You Could Use Me,
I'd Love To Help.

140
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:37,425
That Would Be Lovely.

141
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,613
It Would?

142
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,550
Yes, Of Course.
Why Wouldn't It?

143
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,238
Nobody? Okay, I'm Going In.

144
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:51,594
Because You Two Would Kill
Each Other... Literally.

145
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:52,550
It'll Start
With Hair Pullg

146
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,313
And End With Detectives
Taking Our Statements.

147
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,987
Remember The Pie Thing?
"Remember The Pie Thing"-

148
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,206
Tibetan Monks
Remember The Pie Thing.

149
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:03,188
I Acknowledge That Katherine
And I Have Had Our Differences,

150
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,175
But We Have All Been
Through A Lot Recently.

151
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,675
And I Would Hope
That It Taught Us

152
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:10,187
To Put Our Differences Aside
And Be Friends,

153
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:14,050
Because That's
What's Most Important.

154
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,050
I Faced Cancer And A Tornado,

155
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,675
But I'm Running From This.

156
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:33,565
Hi.

157
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,863
Oh, My God. Rick.

158
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,191
Hi.

159
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:40,375
How Are You?

160
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:42,863
Great, Actually.

161
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,050
We're Great.

162
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,128
Well, You Look Great.

163
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:45,999
Mm.

164
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,999
Oh. Hey, Tom.
Look Who's Here-Rick.

165
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,175
I See That.

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,222
Table For One?

167
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:55,456
Uh, No, Thanks.

168
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:59,487
I Just Wanted To Come By
And Bring You Guys...

169
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,050
It's Barolo.

170
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,393
I Just Got Back
From Italy.

171
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,050
Oh, Well, That's Nice.
Thank You.

172
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,425
Ah, What's The Occasion? Or Are
You Just Being A Good Guy?

173
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,988
I Can't Get Anything
Past You, Huh, Tom?

174
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,487
Well, I...
I've Got Some Work To Do.

175
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,203
Yeah, Well, You Know,

176
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,410
I Wanted To Come Here
And Tell You Guys In Person.

177
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,675
I'm Opening My Own Place.
Uh, You Must Have Seen It.

178
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,878
That's You?
On The Corner?

179
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,813
Yeah, I Looked Everywhere,
I Swear.

180
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,999
But, Uh,
It Was The Best Location.

181
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,941
I'll Bet.

182
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,343
Okay, Look, People Like
To Eat In Fairview.

183
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:40,081
There's Plenty Of Business
For Both Of Us.

184
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,050
Hey, I Remember You!

185
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,625
You Ck To Working Here
Now? Oh, No. Sorry.

186
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,675
Too Bad.
That Osso Buco Of Yours Was-

187
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,456
Really Something.

188
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,815
Well, I Got It On The Menu
At My New Place On The Corner.

189
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,410
Come Check Us Out.

190
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,690
See? Room For Everyone.

191
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,816
Oh! Orson, You Scared Me.

192
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,112
Why Are You Sitting
Down Here In The Dark?

193
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:39,425
And Aren't You
A Little Cold?

194
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:42,125
I Had To Do Something.

195
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,188
Then You Came Down Here And You
Couldn't Remember What It Was.

196
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,300
That Happens
To Me All The Time.

197
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,500
Well, The Baby Is Insisting

198
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,300
That I Eat The Last Piece
Of Bree's Triple-Chocolate Cake.

199
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,988
If You Want, We Could-

200
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,628
Oh, My God. You're Naked!

201
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,175
In My Kitchen Where I Eat.

202
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,238
Okay,
I Don't Hear You Leaving.

203
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:11,907
I Had To Do Something.

204
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,706
Pajamas-That's Something
You Could Do.

205
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,238
Okay, You're Right.

206
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:19,313
You're A Guest In My House-

207
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,312
A Completely Naked Guest
In My House.

208
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,940
I Should Leave.

209
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,628
Hey.
Hey.

210
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,300
You Were Supposed
To Be Home At 8:00

211
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,953
To Help Me Wrangle The Kids
For Bath Time.

212
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,237
It's-It's Almost 11:00.

213
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,644
Sorry.

214
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,909
So Where Were You?

215
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,456
You Were Stewing,
Weren't You?

216
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:44,690
Come On.

217
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,722
You're Upset About Rick.

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,266
Look.

219
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm Not Gonna Deny
I Was Ticked Off When I Saw Him.

220
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:54,875
But I'm Over It.

221
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,156
I'm Taking This
As A Challenge.

222
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,768
We Are Gonna Up Our Game.

223
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,203
Oh, Yeah? Yep. You
Know What I Did Tonight?

224
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:02,972
I Worked On Our Menu.

225
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,050
We Are Gonna Start Making
Our Own Osso Buco.

226
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,550
I Got A Recipe
That Is Gonna Kick His Ass.

227
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,706
So You're Really Okay
With This?

228
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,487
Yeah, I'm Great.
Look At How Cute You Are.

229
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:17,112
Oh?
It's Growing Back Fast, Huh?

230
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,878
Yeah, It's Back.

231
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,863
Morning, Susan.

232
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh. Good Morning.

233
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,999
Love What You're Wearing.

234
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,281
Oh,
I Hope This Isn't Decaf.

235
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,425
Got A Big Day Ahead Of Me.

236
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,718
All Right. We Don't Need
To Talk About It.

237
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,768
Just Promise Me
It Won't Happen Again.

238
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,402
What Won't Happen Again?

239
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,502
Orson, You Were Naked
In This Kitchen Last Night.

240
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,735
I Was Not.

241
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,469
You Most Certainly Were.

242
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:03,378
Good Morning.
What's Going On?

243
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:07,999
Well, Susan Claims She Saw Me Last
Night Au Naturel. It Wasn't A Claim.

244
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,102
He Was Sitting Rht Here
Without A Stitch Of Clothing On,

245
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,253
And I Couldn't Have Cake.

246
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,002
Oh, I Think I Know
What's Going On.

247
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,968
Somebody Had
A Naughty Dream.

248
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,999
Susan, I'm Blushing.

249
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,968
No, No, No, No. No,
I Did Not Have A Sex Dream.

250
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:29,302
Susan,
It's Perfectly Understandable.

251
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,568
Mike's Away.
You're Feeling A Little Lonely.

252
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,050
Naturally,
You'd Project Those Feelings

253
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,635
Onto The Nearest Available
Sex Machine.

254
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:36,635
Oh!

255
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:38,469
You Are Such A Scamp.

256
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,135
I Know When I'm Dreaming,
And This Really Happened.

257
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,738
Why Else Wou I Be Sponging
Butt Prints Off My Sol?

258
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,878
You Know, Susan, Sometimes
I Climb Into A Warm Bath

259
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,987
With A Romance Novel.

260
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,335
Just A Thought.

261
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,402
You Wanna Give Me
A Hand With This?

262
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,300
Lynette!

263
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:16,175
Gaby, Since When Do You Come
To Price Warehouse?

264
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,738
I'm Poor Now. Remember?

265
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:21,238
I Have To Mingle
With The Unwashed Masses.

266
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,344
What Are You Doing Here?

267
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,675
Oh, I've Been Unwashed
For Years.

268
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,128
This Place Is Huge!

269
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:30,112
Would It Kill Them
To Have Valet Parking?

270
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,097
Gaby, People Don't Come Here
For The Amenities.

271
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:35,612
They Come Because
Toilet Paper's 3 Cents A Ton.

272
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,000
Look At All
These Handicapped Spots.

273
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,453
I Mean, What A Waste.
Take That Guy Selling Oranges,

274
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,175
Put Him In A Vest,
Stick Him Under An Umbrella,

275
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,987
And Bam!
You Got Valet Parking.

276
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,237
I Don't Know Why Poor People
Refuse To Better Themselves.

277
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,784
Yeah,
We're Crazy That Way.

278
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,797
I Don't Know Why

279
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,078
You're Complaining
About Handicapped Spaces.

280
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,863
Doesn't Carlos Have One
Of Those Blue Placards?

281
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,363
No, I Think You Have
To Have A Wheelchair

282
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:02,563
To Get One Of Those.

283
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,378
No, I'm Pretty Sure
The Blind Qualify, Too.

284
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,437
Mom, Can I Take Some
Of These Cookies Up To Julie?

285
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,613
Why Don't You Offer Some
To Our Guest First?

286
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,175
Oh, No, Thank You. We Have
So Much Ground To Cover.

287
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:23,999
Now Let's Move On
To The Flowers.

288
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:24,863
Uh, Last Year,

289
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:28,500
We Went With A Cascade
Of Pink And White Roses.

290
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,737
There It Is.

291
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:30,878
Exquisite.

292
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,188
Well, Easy Enough.

293
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:35,815
Let's Just Do That
Again, Then.

294
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,457
Next?

295
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,613
Well...

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,613
If You Have
A Different Idea,

297
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,969
I Would Love
To Hear That, Too.

298
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,300
Well, I Was Thinking

299
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,487
It Might Be Nice To Do
Something More Unusual.

300
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:56,171
What About An Arrangement
Of Purple Lisianthus

301
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:59,031
With A Spray
Of Dark Berries?

302
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,644
It's Interesting. I Can't
Really Picture That, Though.

303
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,550
Well, Let Me Help You.

304
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,941
I Keep Scrapbooks, Too.

305
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:18,675
My Mom And Mrs. Hodge Are Still
Talking About That Ball Thing.

306
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,393
She Wants Me To Be A Part
Of The Founder's Court

307
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,329
Or Whatever They Call It.

308
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,062
Like I Want To Put On
A Stupid White Dress

309
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,578
And Greet People All Night.

310
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:32,175
I Know. It's So Pathetic.
By The Way, I'm Doing It.

311
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,362
Seriously? Why?

312
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,129
Because I Did It Last Year,

313
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,550
And It's Actually Kind Of
Hilarious And Great.

314
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:43,487
It Is! It Doesn't Sound
Great. It Sounds Beyond Lame.

315
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,050
I Don't Want This To Come Off
The Wrong Way,

316
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,253
But You're A Buzz Kill.
Julie!

317
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,441
Okay, You Spend All Of Your Time
Cooped Up In Here Alone,

318
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,800
Obsessing Over
Some Mysterious Thing

319
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,500
That Maybe Happened To
Your Real Dad Or Maybe Didn't.

320
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,300
Look, I'm Not Saying
Don't Obsess.

321
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,675
I'm Just Saying Maybe
You Could Spare Some Time

322
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:03,550
To Have A Little Fun
With Your Friend, Too.

323
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,079
So This Founder's Thing-
It'll Be Fun?

324
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,504
Uh, These Were
The Centerpieces

325
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:18,750
From The Vanover Medical Center
Benefit.

326
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,999
The Donors Were Blown Away.

327
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,020
Well, They're Certainly...
Assertive.

328
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,521
My Only Fear Is-

329
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,159
I Know. I Know.

330
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,454
Fairview Is A Bit More
Provinci Compared To Chicago,

331
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:32,738
But I Think You'll Find
The People Here

332
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,300
Have A Lot More Taste
Than You Give Them Credit For.

333
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,488
Well, Perhaps I Could Try
Something New.

334
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,688
Let's Go
With The Lisianthus.

335
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:48,112
Look At You! Pronouncing It
Right The Very First Time.

336
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,863
Isn't Learning Fun?

337
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:03,800
Mrs. Scavo?

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,875
Uh, Yes.
Is Your Husband Home?

339
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,937
We're Investigating An Incident
Involving Vandalism.

340
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,238
Vandalism?

341
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:13,362
Porter! Preston!
Get Over Here!

342
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,675
No, Ma'am. This Incident
Occurred Two Nights Ago

343
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,425
Near Your Pizzeria.

344
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,816
Someone Threw A Brick Through
A Window Of A New Restaurant-

345
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:22,300
A Place Called Rick's?
What?

346
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,375
We're Asking Everybody
Who Works In The Area

347
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:27,050
If They Saw Anything Suspicious.
I Didn't Go Into Work That Night.

348
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,175
I Did, But, Um,
I Didn't See Anything.

349
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,394
What Time Did It Happen? The
Alarm Went Off At About 10:.

350
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,988
Oh, I Was Home Way Before Then,
Around 8:00.

351
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,831
I Came Home Early To Help You
Wrangle The Kids For Bath Time.

352
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,112
Yeah. No, He Was Here.

353
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,206
All Right, Well, If You Do
Happen To Hear Anything,

354
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,300
Could You Give Us A
Call, Please? Absolutely.

355
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,613
Thank You.
Hey.

356
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:50,113
Mm. Oh, Oh, Hey, Honey.
Could You Hold Back A Sec?

357
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:50,894
Nope. Uh, Lunch Rush

358
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:53,363
I'm Already Late As It Is,
Okay? See Ya.

359
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,640
Excuse Me, Miss.

360
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,831
Oh, Hey There.

361
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,175
I Guess You Didn't See
That Big Blue Sign.

362
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:18,362
This Is Handicapped Parking.
I Know. Primo Spot, Isn't It?

363
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,375
What? I Have A Thingy.

364
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:22,800
Yeah, I Noticed That.

365
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,609
You Don't Look Handicapped
To Me.

366
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,266
I'm Not. My Husband Is.
He's Blind.

367
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,141
Well,
Then That Placard's For Him.

368
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,438
Only He Can Park Here.

369
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:33,362
And How Is He Gonna Park A Car
If He Can't See?

370
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,300
Feeling
Pretty Stupid Now, Aren't Ya?

371
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,687
Lady,
You Got A Lot Of Nerve.

372
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,363
I Had To Park Next
To The Dumpster Way In The Back.

373
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:53,125
Oh, Don't Play Victim
With Me.

374
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,737
I Have To Walk In Heels
All Day Long.

375
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,050
You Get To Sit In A Chair
And Roll.

376
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,503
You Did Not Just Say That!

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,078
You Know, The Quicker
I Can Run My Errands,

378
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,613
The Faster I Can Get Home
To My Husband,

379
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:06,675
Who Needs Me, Because That's
The Kind Of Person I Am.

380
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,753
W
- What Are You Doing? Calling The Cops. You're Getting A Ticket.

381
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,938
Like Hell I Am! Give Me That. Get Off!

382
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:16,222
No! You Started It.
Hang It Up! Ow! Get Off!

383
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,999
Hang It Up!
Aah!

384
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,503
Hey, Hey! Oh!
Is There A Problem Here?

385
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,941
Jeez. What, Is There A Telethon
Going On Around Here?

386
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,500
Dude,
She Took One Of Our Spots.

387
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,363
Bitch! I Had To Find
Street Parking.

388
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,112
Hey, There's A Secity Guard Over There.
Go Get Him. No, No, No, No, No. Wait!

389
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,562
Okay, You Know What?
This Is Getting Ridiculous.

390
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,300
Oh, No, No.
You're Not Going Anywhere.

391
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,999
Hey!
Let Me Go!

392
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,362
Hey! Hey! Stop!
Let Me Go!

393
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:45,818
What Are You Doing? Don't-
Ow!

394
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:51,751
Well, It's Official.
I'm Going To Hell.

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,562
Hi, Daddy.
Hey.

396
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,988
Hey, Guys, Would You Go Play
In The Back For A While?

397
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:02,253
I Need To Talk To Your Dad.
Thanks.

398
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,300
Well...

399
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,703
Hey. Don't They
Have Soccer Today?

400
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,566
Let Me Answer That Question
With Another Question.

401
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,050
Why Did You Lie To Police?

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,530
-Lynette
- And You Made Me Lie To Them,Too,

403
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,170
Which Brings Up
Another Question.

404
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,300
-Did You Know That Perjury Is,Like,This Whole Big Thing?
-I Think You're Overreacting.

405
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,310
No,Overreacting Would Be If
I Threw A Brick Through You.

406
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,110
What Were You Thinking?

407
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,650
Help Me Understand.

408
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,960
I Just Wento Go Check Out How
The Construction Was Going,

409
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,830
But I Came Around The Corner.

410
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,070
I Saw This Giant Picture
Window That Says "Rick's. "

411
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,410
And Then I Realize I'm Gonna
Have To See That Guy's Name

412
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,020
Every Damn Day Of My Life.

413
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,270
Then I Noticed
This Pile Of Bricks.

414
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,930
Okay.

415
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,360
I Know This Whole
Thing With Rick-

416
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,970
It Really Caused
Us Some Damage.

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,050
I Know It Hurt Us,But We
Survived It,And It's Over Now.

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,660
Now That's The Thing,Lynette.

419
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,820
It's Not Over.
It Was Never Over.

420
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,770
I Don't Care About
Rick's Stupid Restaurant!

421
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,130
I Don't Even Care That He
Wants To Steal You From Me!

422
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,110
Of Course,He Would Want
To Steal You From Me.

423
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,540
That Makes Sense To Me.

424
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,860
I Care That He Made You
Act Like It Could Be Done.

425
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Oh,Tom.

426
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,290
He Changed The
Way I Look At You.

427
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,010
But...

428
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,460
Nothing Ever
Happened Between Us.

429
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,680
You Have To
Believe Me. Come On!

430
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,520
I Am Notrying To
Get You To Apologize.

431
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm Just Explaining The Brick.

432
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,270
Oh,My God.

433
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,370
You Thought I Was
Crazy,But It Wasn't A Dream.

434
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,410
You're Naked!

435
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,130
I Didn't Mean To Do It.

436
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,050
Oh,Really?

437
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,570
You Just Happened To Stumble
Naked Into My Front Yard?

438
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,450
I Didn't Mean It,Mike.

439
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,150
"Mike"? Wait.

440
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,610
Are You Sleepwalking?

441
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,390
Orson.

442
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,560
Hello?

443
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,410
Susan.

444
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,500
Did You Just Hit Me?

445
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh,Dear God!

446
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,240
Orson,You're
Staying At My House!

447
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,340
There You Go.

448
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,730
I Have No Explanation.
This Doesn't Happen To Me.

449
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,450
I Don't Sleepwalk.

450
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,080
You Know,It's None
Of My Business,

451
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,290
But Seeing As I Have Seen You
Naked Twice In Theast Week,

452
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,030
I Think I Can Ask,Is
Something Bothering You?

453
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,140
I Don't Think So.

454
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,340
I Mean,Being Out Of Our
House Has Been A Little Weird,

455
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,050
But I'm Very Comfortable Here.

456
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,620
Clearly.

457
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,870
You Know,When You
Were Out On The Lawn,

458
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
You Said Something About Mike.

459
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,390
Mike?

460
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,980
What,Uh,What Did I Say?

461
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,060
Well,It Was Just
Sort Of Muttering.

462
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,230
Were You Having
A Dream About Him?

463
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,530
No. I-I Don't Believe So.

464
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,350
Well,Maybe It's Because
You Just Saw Him.

465
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,840
-He Must Be On Your Mind.
-Yeah,Yeah. You Know What,Susan?

466
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,260
I
- I Think It's Time For Us To Move Out.

467
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,950
You Can't. Your House
Isn't Finished Yet.

468
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,310
No,The Downstairs Will
Be Ready Next Week.

469
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,290
-We'll Be Fine.
-Well,If You Insist...

470
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,020
I Think It Will
Be For The Best.

471
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,950
Okay,But In The Meantime,Um,I
Do Have A Teenage Daughter,

472
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,680
So If You Could...

473
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,000
Boxers?

474
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,030
Yes. Thanks.

475
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,270
Hey!

476
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,380
Come On. You've Been
Cooped Up In This House

477
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
Since You Got Home
From The Hospital.

478
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,710
-Let's Go Out And Have Some Fun!
-No,I Think I'm Gonna Stay Here.

479
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,320
-I Don't-I Don't Wanna Be A Burden. -Carlos,I
See Handicapped People Out And About All The Time.

480
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,470
In Fact,I Met Two
Feisty Men In Wheelchairs

481
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,840
Yesterday At The Mall. They
Were Living Their Lives...

482
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,230
So It's Time For
You To Live Yours.

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,580
Come On. Come On.

484
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm Just Dropping
Off A Few Letters.

485
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,860
You Might As Well
Just Wait Here.

486
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,280
Just Picking Up Some Vitamins.

487
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,130
I'll Be Quicker
If I Do It Myself.

488
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,120
I Just Have To Drop Off
A Gift To My Manicurist.

489
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Why Don't You
Listen To The Radio?

490
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,140
Thank You.

491
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,740
Sorry,Babe. That Took
A Little Longer Than I...

492
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,620
Carlos?

493
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,400
Carlos?

494
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,100
Carlos?!

495
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,850
Carlos!

496
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,610
Oh,There You Are.

497
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,960
Thanks,Henry.

498
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,750
-Where The Hell Have You Been?
-I Was Starving,

499
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,030
So I Got That Kid To Take
Me To Go Get A Burger.

500
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,230
I Don't Believe This. I
Was Worried Sick About You!

501
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,690
I'm Sick Of Waiting Here!
You Promised Me A Fun Day,

502
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,990
And All I Got Is A Sunburn
On The Right Side Of My Face.

503
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm Sorry. I Told You,I
Had Errands To Run First.

504
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,350
-What's That Smell?
-What Smell?

505
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,990
It Smells Like...

506
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,960
Nail Polish. Did You
Get Your Nails Done?

507
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,350
Is That What
You've Been Doing?

508
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,740
Excuse Me. Miss!

509
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,950
Is That Your Aston Martin
In The Handicapped Space?

510
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,290
What? Gaby,Are You Parked
In A Handicapped Spot?

511
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,010
Move It Along,Pops. We're
Gonna Be Here A While.

512
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,320
Wait,Wait,Wait. Did You
Get A Handicapped Tag?

513
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,030
To Answer Your Earlier
Question,Yes,I Got A Manicure.

514
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm Sorry. Are We Good?

515
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh,My God!

516
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,350
You're Exploiting My Blindness

517
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,710
So That You Can
Score Better Parking?!

518
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,010
That's A Really
Mean Way To Put It.

519
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,620
You Had Me Out Here,

520
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,350
Sitting Like A Dog With
The Window Cracked Open.

521
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,790
-You Used Me!
-Well,Why Shouldn't I Get Something Out Of This?

522
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,090
-You Know,The Blindness Didn't Just Happen To You.
-You Can't Be Serious.

523
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,900
Oh,You Bet I Am!

524
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,990
Every Morning,The
Toothpaste Has To Be

525
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,080
To The Left Of The
Sink,Because If It's Not,

526
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,150
You Can't Find It,And
I Have To Put It There.

527
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,740
And-And Sometimes- I
Don't Know-I'm Driving,

528
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,090
Or I'm In Line At The Bank

529
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,310
And I Think,"Is The
Toothpaste There?"

530
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,950
So Then I Have To
Run Home And Check

531
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,920
Because I Don't Want
You Reaching For The Tube

532
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,580
And Not Being Able To Find
It. I Just Didn't Think

533
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,790
This Was How It Was
All Gonna Tu Out,Carlos.

534
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,870
I Didn't Think That Every
Day For The Rest Of My Life,

535
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,040
A Part Of Me Is Always Gonna
Think,"Where's The Toothpaste?"

536
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,770
Can't You Just Leave
It In The Drawer?

537
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,490
That's Not The
Point,You Blind Idiot!

538
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm Saying

539
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,620
If All I Get In Exchange
For This Crappy Situation

540
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,980
Is A Nice Parking Spot
For My $8 Manicure,

541
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,330
Then I'm Taking It!

542
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,240
Who Put Pear Slices
In The Waldorf Salad?

543
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,450
Guess That Would Be Me.

544
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,590
Katherine,A Waldorf
Salad Is Made With Apples.

545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
It's Tradition.

546
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,430
Yes,A Musty,19th
Century Tradition

547
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,160
In Need Of Some Jazzing Up.

548
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,970
Look,I Just Thought You Have
So Much On Your Mind Already,

549
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,030
What With The Music
And The Decorations.

550
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,110
-The Least I Could Do Was Take Over The Food.
-"Take Over"?

551
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,000
What In God's Name Have You
Done With My French Onion Soup?

552
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,470
Oh,It'll Be Fine.
I Told The Chef

553
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,030
Nothing Is To Leave That
Kitchen Unless I've Tasted It.

554
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,420
-Katherine
-Trust Me.

555
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,300
After All,

556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,550
I've Gotten Tons Of
Compliments On The Lisianthus.

557
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,160
Here,Honey. Let Me.

558
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,340
Thanks.

559
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,520
You're Welcome.

560
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,170
Just So You Know...

561
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,410
I'm Sorry For What I'm
Putting You Through.

562
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,510
If It Were Anyone But
You,It Wouldn't Be Worth It.

563
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,350
You Ready To Go To The Party?

564
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,620
You Tell Me.

565
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,720
How Do I Look?

566
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,100
You Look Very Handsome.

567
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,920
Thank You.

568
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,610
And You Look More
Beautiful Than Ever.

569
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,580
How Do You Know That?

570
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,170
Just A Hunch.

571
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,150
Bup,Bup,Bup! Don't Eat That.

572
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,180
We Had A
Refrigeration Problem,

573
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,370
And I Don't Want
You Getting Sick.

574
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,820
Oh,Dear. Well,I Should
Throw This Dip Out.

575
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,350
Thanks. It'll Be
About Ten Minutes

576
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,490
Before I Can Make
Up A New Batch.

577
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,270
Do You Mind Tellinyour Boss?

578
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,460
She's Not My Boss!

579
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,760
Bree! The Room
Is Simply Lovely.

580
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,110
You've Outdone Yourself.

581
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,470
Thank You,Mrs. Downing.

582
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,810
Listen,When I Present The
Founder's Award Tonight,

583
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,800
-I Was Wondering 
-Oh,Dear. Has No One Spoken To You?

584
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,780
-About What?
-Uh,Well...

585
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,050
The Committee Has Decided
That It Would Be Best

586
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,050
If Katherine Mayfair
Present The Award This Year.

587
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,370
No! That's... That's
My Job. I Always Do It.

588
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,780
Oh,Well,You're
Already Doing So Much,

589
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,480
And,Well,Katherine
Was Quite Insistent.

590
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,980
What's That?

591
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,970
-Oh,It's Dip. The Caterer Just Said That 
-I Thought We Agreed.

592
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,770
Nothing Leaves The Kitchen
Without Me Tasting It First.

593
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,150
Dig In.

594
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,020
Is Everyone Having Fun?

595
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,410
You And Kathere
Did An Amazing Job.

596
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,360
Boy,We Didn't Think You
Guys Could Work Together.

597
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,100
Yeah,We Were Sure One Of You
Would End Up Killing The Other.

598
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,780
You Really Should Have
More Faith In People.

599
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,910
Excuse Me.

600
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,520
Katherine,Darling,Are
You Okay?

601
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,940
Not Really.

602
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,430
Oh. I Hope There'sothing
Wrong With The Food.

603
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
Is Anybody Else Getting Sick?

604
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,830
Oh,No.

605
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,450
No,Dear. Just You.

606
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,860
Maybe You Should Go Home.

607
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,820
I Can't. I Have To Present
The Founder's Award.

608
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,300
Oh,No One Would Expect You
To Do That In Your Condition.

609
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,020
You Know What?
Um,I Could Do It.

610
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,500
No. I Can Get It Together.

611
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,290
Katherine,No One Expects
You To Be A Martyr.

612
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,480
-Why Don't You Go Home?
-I Can't.

613
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,740
Why Not? I'm Perfectly
Capable Of Presenting.

614
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,500
I've Done It For
The Last Eight Years.

615
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,780
And Let's Face It.

616
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,160
I Mean,No One Wants To
Accept An Award From A Woman

617
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,540
Who Looks Like She Should Be
In Line At The Needle Exchange.

618
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,280
This Is Important
To Me. I'll Be Fine.

619
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,700
And Now For The Presentation
For The Founder's Award-

620
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,500
Ms. Katherine Mayfair.

621
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,170
Thank You,Mrs. Downing.

622
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,300
I Was Honored

623
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,820
When You And The Other
Members Of The Committee

624
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,490
Asked Me To
Present This Award.

625
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,360
-"I Was Honored When You... " Myeah,Myeah,Myeah,Myeah.
-Bree,What's Up?

626
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,520
I Thought Giving Out
This Award Was Your Thing.

627
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,620
Used To Be. Not
Anymore. Things Change.

628
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,910
This Year's Founder's Award...

629
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,560
Ever Since I Started Working
With That Obnoxious Backstabber,

630
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,600
She's Done Nothing But Try To
Take The Spotlight Off Of Me

631
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,800
And Put It Onto Her.

632
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:03,010
Goes To My Dear
Friend... Bree Hodge.

633
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,080
The Obnoxious Backstabber
Just Called Your Name.

634
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,860
Bree Has Been A Pillar
Of The Fairview Community

635
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,150
For Many Years.

636
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,610
There Is No Better
Friend Than Bree Hodge.

637
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,520
Congratulations.

638
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,730
I Know You Tried To Poison Me.

639
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,070
Well,Uh,

640
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,510
This Has Been An
Evening Full Of,Um...

641
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
Surprises. Uh...

642
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,280
I Never Would've
Imagined That,Um,

643
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,990
I Would Be Recognized By
This Wonderful Organization...

644
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,700
Hi,Andrew. Guess What?

645
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,230
-Ur Mom Just Won The Founder's Award.
-Lynette,Listen To Me.

646
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,290
Oh,My God.

647
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,140
-You're Not Gonna Believe What's Going On Down Here.
-What? What? Is Everyone Okay?

648
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,890
Uh,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah.
We're-We're Fine.

649
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,190
It's Rick's Place
- Totally Went Up In Flames.

650
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,710
There,Uh,There Are,Like,Three
Fire Trucks Here.

651
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,690
Oh,My God! That's
Horrible! How Did It Start?

652
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
I- They-They
Don't Know.

653
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,130
Okay,I-I'm Gonna-I'll Call
You Back In About Five. Bye.

654
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,020
I Want To Thank You So Much

655
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,680
For Presenting Me
With This Award. I...

656
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,850
I Certainly,Uh,Wasn't
Expecting It.

657
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,710
Um,We Have A Small City
With A Great,Big Heart,

658
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,190
And I Am Honored
To,Uh,Accept This Award

659
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,390
From My Dear Friend...

660
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,060
The Photographer's Asking

661
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,180
If He Can Get Shots
Of The Two Of Us.

662
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,660
Wait.

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,440
I Need To Talk To You First.

664
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,110
I Misunderstood The
Situation,That's All.

665
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,300
Can We Just Leave It At That?

666
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,740
No,We Can't.

667
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,480
And Do You Know Why?

668
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,030
Because I Thought
Things Were Going Well.

669
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,430
I Was Having Fun With You.

670
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,740
Obviously...

671
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,550
I Misunderstood.

672
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,370
So Tell Me,

673
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,680
Was There A Straw That
Broke The Camel's Back?

674
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,700
Or Were You Planning
On Killing Me All Along?

675
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,620
Here's The Thing

676
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,100
You Need To Understand
About Me And My Friends.

677
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,610
We Each Have Our Niche.

678
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,690
Gabrielle's The Glamorous One.

679
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,060
Susan's The Adorable
One. Lynette's Smart.

680
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,860
Edie's... Edie.

681
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,690
And I'm The Domestic
One,The Organizer-

682
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,120
The One Who Knows That There Are
Three Tines On A Dessert Fork.

683
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,430
I'm The One Who Gets Teased
For That. That's Who I Am.

684
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,700
And That's Also Who You Are.

685
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,170
So?

686
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,790
So...

687
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,120
I Don't Really Know How
To Be Friends With You.

688
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,750
That's A Shame...

689
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,190
Because I Understand You Better
Than All Those Other Women Do.

690
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,670
I Know How Following The Rules

691
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,410
And Observing
The Little Graces

692
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,910
Makes You Feel Like
You're In Control.

693
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,810
We've Both Had Days
Where It Was Either

694
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,280
Set A Beautiful Table

695
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,980
Or Curl Up In A Ball And Die.

696
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,140
We're The Same,Bree.

697
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,420
And If You Think That
Means We Can't Be Friends,

698
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,580
Then I'm Sorry.

699
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,430
But It Might Also Mean
We Could Be Best Friends.

700
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,060
Who Knew You Were
So Insightful?

701
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,070
Isn't Learning Fun?

702
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,100
Terrific,Everyone. Thank You.

703
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,410
Pictures.

704
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,670
So... Did I Lie? Was It Cool?

705
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,010
You Were Right. It Really Was.

706
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,850
-"Thank You,Julie. "
-Oh.

707
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,360
It's Good To Get Out
Of My Own Head,You Know?

708
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,870
For Months Now,I've Been
Hung Up On Looking For My Dad

709
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,970
And Blaming My Mom...

710
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,560
And It's Gotten Me Nowhere.

711
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,490
I Just Wanna Start
Having Fun Again.

712
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,110
Thank You,Julie.

713
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,640
There You Are.

714
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,240
We Wanted To Get Some
Pictures With You. Mm.

715
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,480
Orson.

716
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,200
Hi. Um... Listen,I
- I Have A 12:00 Curfew,

717
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,470
So If My Mom
Asks,Can You Just-

718
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,720
Mike?

719
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,780
No,It's Julie.

720
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,450
Oh,You're Sleepwalking.
Yeah,I Heard About That.

721
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,310
I'm Sorry,Mike.

722
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,610
Again,Not Mike.

723
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,730
Why Don't I-I Get
You Back To Bed,

724
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,410
And-And
You Can-

725
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,800
I'm Sorry I Ran You Over,Mike.

726
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,440
Blindness-

727
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,130
It's An Affliction
That Prevents People

728
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,500
From Seeing What Is
Right In Front Of Them...

729
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,890
Like The Wives Who
Can't Detect The Jealousy

730
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,400
That Consumes
Their Husbands...

731
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,390
The Women Unable To See
That A Rival Might Also

732
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,960
Be A Friend...

733
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,330
The Men Who Stay Oblivious

734
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,910
To The Guilt That
Lies Deep Within Them.

735
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,280
Yes...

736
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,910
The World Is Filled With
Those Who Cannot See.

737
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,210
The Most Dangerous Are
The Ones Who Stay Blind

738
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,410
To The Evil Within
Their Own Hearts.

739
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,360
How Do We Protect
Ourselves From These People?

740
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,210
First,We Have To Open Our
Own Eyes And Find Them...

741
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,830
Before They Find Us.

742
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,530
