1
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,400

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,120
My new book The Hidden Reality takes on a grand question:

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,380
Is our universe the only universe?

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,610
You see, there's a growing belief among scientists like me

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,110
that ours may only be one among many universes

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,740
populating a gigantic cosmos.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,970
In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,330
without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,740
on the part of the reader.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,010
Hysterical.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,060
I'm glad you talked me into this.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,400
We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,110
- and do something silly. - Agreed.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,580
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,330
You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,780
You can think about Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle"

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,940
much like the special order menu

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,360
that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,110
dishes in column A and other dishes in column B,

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,670
and if you order the first dish in column A,

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,680
you can't order the corresponding dish in column B.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
That's sort of like the "uncertainly principle."

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,940
Ba-dum-bump.

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,010
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,700
about Howard and Bernadette.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,850
Really, Amy? Gossip?

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm disappointed in you.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,410
No, now.

29
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,570
Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip

30
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,360
as an aid to social bonding in large groups.

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,550
Forgive my language, but "poppycock".

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,940
What if he's right?

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,850
And by not participating in gossip,

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,150
society breaks down into

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,550
small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders

36
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,480
fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,190
Fine.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,600
In the parlance of the urban music scene,

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,590
"what's the 4-1-1"?

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,590

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,230
Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

42
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,270
I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe.

43
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,520
Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,460
Yes?

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,270
You've dedicated your life's work

46
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,310
to educating the general populace

47
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,800
about complex scientific ideas.

48
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,060
Yes, in part.

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,200
Have you ever considered

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,610
trying to do something useful?

51
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,680
Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

52
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,040
Excuse me?

53
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah, but not your books; something they might enjoy.

54
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,910
I kid, of course. Big fan.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,950
- Nice shot. - Thank you.

56
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,970
My father taught me archery as a child.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,510
It's odd how the activity

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,810
brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,750
- Perfect. - I know.

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,110
What an elf I would have made.

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,550
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,740
Shooting at a target?

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,080
With what?

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,670
- An arrow. - Really?

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,990
I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.

66
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,900
Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,740
in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience.

69
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,530
We have to do our part, too.

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,100
That was uncalled for, but...

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,680
I'll play along. Ow.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,510
I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.

73
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,240
Really? How could you tell?

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,480
She was attempting to engage me in gossip.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,070
- Mm. You don't say. - Yes.

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,740
I think prolonged exposure to Penny

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,380
has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

78
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,560
So, what's the gossip?

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,730
Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

80
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,120
I have no desire to engage in the activity.

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,650
Fine, don't tell me.

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,660
All right, get this.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,730
Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

84
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,860
That's too bad. I wonder what happened.

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,960
Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,410
based on the data I collected

87
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,930
watching my parents' marriage implode.

88
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,640
In that case, the woman dives into religion,

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,760
while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,470
who tries to buy my love with action figures.

91
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,710
Oop! Out of arrows.

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,750
Boy, you sure get your money's worth out of these games.

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,430
- Priya, can I come in? - Sure.

94
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,690
Oh, God.

95
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,780
- What? - It's okay.

96
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,450
You didn't know. I'll take care of it.

97
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,450
What-what did I do?

98
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,990
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

99
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,680
that close to the mirror.

100
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,050
You're kidding.

101
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,690
It's a splatter thing.

102
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,000
There's a little piece of tape on the floor

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,620
you're supposed to stand behind.

104
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,400
- That's madness. - I know.

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,380
Just do it. There's a big inspection coming up,

106
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,810
and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.

107
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,440
You really need to let me take a look

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,500
at that roommate agreement, one of these days.

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,990
Mm, I don't know.

110
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,860
I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer...

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,970
It's just easier to stand behind the tape.

112
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,560
Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said

113
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend.

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
- Does that sound like fun?  - Yeah!

115
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,870
Dodgers are baseball, right?

116
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,270
You'll need to explain the game to me.

117
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,080
Mm, it's complicated.

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
But as I remember it, the essentials are

119
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,870
"get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home" .

120
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,170
Well, regardless, I've got four tickets.

121
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,500
And I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard.

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,580
She's really interesting,

123
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,330
and I bet I can get used to him.

124
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,570
Well, it might not be a great idea

125
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,600
- to invite those two.  - Why not?

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,910
Don't tell anybody I told you,

127
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,010
but I heard she might be breaking up with him.

128
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,020
Oh...too bad...

129
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,570
Although I do know one person for whom that's good news.

130
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,430
Really? Who?

131
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,380
My brother.

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,210
He's got a big crush on Bernadette.

133
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,880
What?

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,660
You're kidding.

135
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,390
No. I found poems he wrote about her.

136
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,240
Very disturbing.

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,020
"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet" .

138
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,220
- Wow, that's hard to believe.  - Yes.

139
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,080
And for years, everyone in my family

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,280
was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast.

141
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,080
What's that piece of tape?

142
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,400
Oh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.

143
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,440
How's it going?

144
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,870
Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?

145
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,890
'Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?

146
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,600
I heard about it from Sheldon.

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
- He got it from Amy.  - Oh, damn it.

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
I told Amy that in the strictest confidence.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,210
Boy, some people are such blabbermouths.

150
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,900
Well, whatever.

151
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,990
I'm sure Bernadette can do better.

152
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,100
Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,380
with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than

154
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,120
a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?

155
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,020
You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?

156
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,760
I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?

157
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,920
Okay, give.

158
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,050
How do you know? Did he tell you?

159
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,260
- No.  - Well, then who?

160
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,250
I can't say...

161
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,470
Priya told you. What a little gossip.

162
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,130
You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard.

163
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,480
Not judging, just my opinion.

164
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,820
Well, The point is, if this got out,

165
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,200
it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,270
You don't have to worry.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,350
Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.

168
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,650
You're the one who told Amy in the first place.

169
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,900
In confidence.

170
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,820
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?

171
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,080
We're very rich in a very poor country.

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,460
So, all in all, can't complain.

173
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,110
So, Priya,

174
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,350
how are enjoying staying with your brother?

175
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,510
It's fine. But if I'm going to stay

176
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,680
in Los Angeles much longer,

177
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,600
I think I should get my own place.

178
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,470
Why?

179
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,720
Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable?

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,550
Rajesh, why aren't you making your sister comfortable?

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,930
I am making her comfortable.

182
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,940
Besides, she's not sleeping here

183
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,890
half the time anyw...

184
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,150
What?

185
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,600
Where are you sleeping, Priya?

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,720
It's a figure of speech, Daddy.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,960
It means I-I work late.

188
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,110
Please tell me you're not dating an American.

189
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,580
I knew this would happen.

190
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,130
Rajesh, are you letting your sister

191
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,090
date that little Howard boy?

192
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,690
Now, hold on. If she is dating an American,

193
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,390
that's not a bad way to go.

194
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,450
He's Jewish.

195
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,090
Those chaps are very successful,

196
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,930
and they don't drink a lot.

197
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,540
It-It doesn't matter. Howard has a girlfriend.

198
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,240
- For now.  - What does that mean?

199
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,350
I'll tell you later.

200
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,300
Is something going on with him and Bernadette?

201
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,100
- Who's Bernadette?  - Doesn't sound Jewish.

202
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,530
You can't tell by that.

203
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,590
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

204
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,350
Okay, we're getting off the subject.

205
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,780
Rajesh, I want you to try harder

206
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,520
to make your sister feel welcome.

207
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,870
Thank you, Daddy.

208
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,540
Don't worry. Everything I have, I share with her.

209
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,780
Including my friend Leon...

210
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,000
Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,060
Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!

212
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,760
You should have kept your mouth shut.

213
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,530
Fair enough.

214
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,060
Now, what's up with Clarinet...? Bernadette!

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
I've been thinking about Dr. Greene's efforts

216
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,180
to make science palatable for the masses.

217
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,480
Oh, yeah? What about it?

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,600
That's all. I've just been thinking about it.

219
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,360
Now, I'm thinking about fractal equations.

220
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,820
Now I'm thinking about

221
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,020
the origin of the phrase "train of thought."

222
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,130
Now I'm thinking about trains.

223
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,080
Are you listening to this guy?

224
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,670
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,210
I was somewhere else.

226
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,280
Lucky bastard.

227
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,860
Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

228
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,490
So what's up?

229
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,540
It's a Bernadette thing.

230
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.

231
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,990
Whatever it is, we're here for you.

232
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,150
You can tell us anything.

233
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah. Good or devastating.

234
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

235
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,760
- Marry you? - What?

236
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,590
I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.

237
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,400
- Oh, I'd wait.  - No rush, no rush.

238
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,230
Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring.

239
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,880
Hey, David, what'd you find?

240
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,690
Sure, a half a caret's fine.

241
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,350
Her freakishly small hands make anything look big.

242
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,650
It's one of the reasons I love her.

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,310
Man, he's going to be blindsided.

244
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,820
I know. It'll be awful.

245
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,470
Why are you smiling?

246
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,530
Yeah, Raj, why?

247
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,580
Uh, a smile means something different in my country.

248
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,150
You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness.

249
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,850
India's a goofy place.

250
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,040
Oh, I'm back to trains.

251
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,400
Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?

252
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,380
- No. - Fascinating work.

253
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,490
I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.

254
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,020
Have you learned anything?

255
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,070
Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys.

256
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,180
Although it's not much of a contest.

257
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,090
The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,270
If you don't mind,

259
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,640
I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.

260
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,220
By all means.

261
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,100
Howard has announced his intention

262
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,850
to propose marriage to Bernadette.

263
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't understand.

264
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,210
The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.

265
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,970
I know.

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,240
The group consensus is that his proposal

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,250
will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection.

268
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,700
Everyone was set a-twitter.

269
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,490
Although oddly, no one tweeted.

270
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,790
It's not surprising that the story

271
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,110
has captured the attention of our little circle of friends.

272
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,110
Are you familiar with Meme Theory?

273
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,540
I'm familiar with everything, but go on.

274
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,290
Meme Theory suggests that

275
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,220
items of gossip are like living things

276
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,420
that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.

277
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology.

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,220
At Johnson Elementary School,

279
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,840
the phrase "Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

280
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,180
I should think so.

281
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,050
That's gold.

282
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,770
Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me.

283
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,480
How might we examine this more closely?

284
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,040
Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?

285
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,170
It's one of the few forms of interaction with people

286
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,120
that I don't find repellent.

287
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,460
We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.

288
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,940
And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.

289
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,050
Then we'll track its progress through our social group

290
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,620
and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms

291
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,540
of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

292
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,550
Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences.

293
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,650
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

294
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

295
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,260
Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse.

296
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,160
In other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden.

297
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,320
Mum's the word. Gotta go.

298
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,020
Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?

299
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,690
I just felt like drinking alone,

300
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,430
because I'm deep and dark.

301
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,410
So, uh, Howard's not here?

302
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,830
No. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me.

303
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,380
Like when the three of us went to the movies,

304
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,980
and you and I waited outside the bathroom

305
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,230
while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

306
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,200
Do you remember that?

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,020
Yeah.

308
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,280
Me, too.

309
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,890
Good times.

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,180
16 wants to order appetizers.

311
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,690
- Oh, thanks. - This was nice.

312
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,110
What the hell are you doing?

313
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,370
Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend.

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,970
You should be ashamed of yourself.

315
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,070
I was when I came in,

316
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,760
but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt.

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
Besides what you might not know

318
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,510
is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.

319
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,010
Well, I know that. How do you know that?

320
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,980
My sister told me.

321
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,050
Oh, that gossipy bitch.

322
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,340
No offense.

323
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,020
None taken.

324
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,050
You should hear how she talks about you.

325
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,090
Okay, listen,

326
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,130
just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems,

327
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,230
does not mean you should be here sniffing around.

328
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,140
What can I do? I can't stop thinking about her.

329
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,260
All right, try thinking about this--

330
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,800
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

331
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Shut your ass!

332
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,890
Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

333
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,390
How did that even happen?

334
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,170
Did they know that's what they were doing

335
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,820
when they were doing it?

336
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,420
I-I guess they just figurd it out at some point.

337
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,050
I can't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

338
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,810
Hope you're hungry.

339
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,420
Interesting.

340
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,070
A friendly sentiment in this country,

341
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,690
cruel taunt in the Sudan.

342
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,710
It's a lesson in context.

343
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,900
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

344
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,340
Yes, I believe so.

345
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,010
Good, good.

346
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,870
Everything... okay between you two?

347
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,660
Yes.

348
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,590
Why do you ask?

349
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
No reason.

350
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,140
I was just talking to Raj,

351
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,670
and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.

352
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,550
Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun,

353
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,160
tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?

354
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,210
No.

355
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,490
That's not what he meant.

356
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,680
Well, we may never know.

357
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
As my mother would say,

358
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,040
the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

359
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,490
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

360
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,740
Yeah, you do.

361
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,430
You dog, you.

362
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,510
Did you get that?

363
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,820
Every word.

364
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,840
Our false gossip meme

365
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,830
appears to have reached node lambda.

366
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,680
This is moving faster than we thought.

367
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,400
Agreed.

368
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,050
It appears the rate of gossip transmission

369
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,100
is proportional to the number of nodes squared.

370
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,180
I must say, Amy,

371
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,830
pretending to have intercourse with you

372
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,610
is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.

373
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,130
Slow down, Sheldon. I'm not quite there yet.

374
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,340
- Pass the soy sauce. - sure

375
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,740
Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you.

376
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,140
The meme has reached full penetration.

377
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,180
Pun intended?

378
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,170
No. Happy accident.

379
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,850
This is remarkable.

380
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,690
Took less than 24 hours.

381
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,590
I should let you know

382
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,660
that she asked for details about our dalliance.

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,910
Interesting.

384
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,290
So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus

385
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,920
to a "blow by blow," as it were.

386
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,800
Pun intended?

387
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,860
I'm sorry. What pun?

388
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,790
Not important.

389
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,420
I described your lovemaking as "aloof, but effective."

390
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,550
I wish you hadn't done that.

391
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,050
That's going to make me a chick magnet,

392
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,200
and I'm so busy as it is.

393
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
Hey, everybody,

394
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,160
I got something I want to ask Bernadette,

395
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,220
and I can't think of a better time

396
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,970
than when I'm with all my friends.

397
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,310
Oh, hold on, Howard.

398
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,660
There's lots of better times.

399
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,290
Leonard, please. The man is talking.

400
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,260
Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.

401
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,210
Thank you.

402
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,870
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

403
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,590
Oh, God. What's happening?

404
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,440
I know things haven't been perfect with us,

405
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,990
and we've had our problems,

406
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,940
but I just have to tell you, from the moment I...

407
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,900
Howard, let me just stop you right here.

408
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,390
This is it.

409
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,090
Yes.

410
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
Yes, what?

411
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,870
Yes, I will marry you.

412
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,240
- You will? - You will?

413
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,660
I will.

414
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,680
I will!

415
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh, I love you so much.

416
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,420
Oh, I love you, too.

417
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,150
Congratulations!

418
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, it's so exciting.

419
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,030

420
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,210
I wonder what changed her mind.

421
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,300
Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess

422
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,320
renewed her faith in love.

423
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,530
As good an explanation as any.

424
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,530
That's great...

425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,330
Oh, hey, Amy.

426
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,430
Bernadette just texted me.

427
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,860
Howard proposed?

428
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,580
Yes, not important. Just stopped by

429
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,150
to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

430
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,860
Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.

431
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,540
Mum's the word.

432
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,290
You're pregnant?!

433
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,730
Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
