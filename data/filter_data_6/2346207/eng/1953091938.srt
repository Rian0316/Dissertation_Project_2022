1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:03,916
So, how's living alone?

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:05,332
You know, it's interesting.

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:07,467
When I first moved into
my new apartment,

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:09,002
<i>I was nervous.</i>

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:12,889
<i>For the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate.</i>

6
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,558
<i>But then it hit me:</i>

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,829
<i>for the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate!</i>

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,884
<i>If I want to walk around naked,</i>
<i>nobody cares.</i>

9
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:26,736
<i>If I want to leave</i>
<i>the laundry basket</i>

10
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:30,774
<i>in the middle of the living</i>
<i>room, nobody stops me.</i>

11
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:32,826
<i>If I bring home soup</i>
<i>from the deli</i>

12
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:35,895
<i>and leave it in the fridge</i>
<i>for two days, nobody eats it.</i>

13
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,832
<i>And if I do something</i>
<i>colossally stupid,</i>

14
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,234
<i>nobody ever has to know.</i>

15
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,540
People make fun of the guy

16
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,959
who stays home every night
doing nothing.

17
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,946
But the truth is...
that guy's a genius.

18
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,249
<i>Because let's be honest,</i>
<i>sitting around watching TV,</i>

19
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,085
<i>drinking beer and eating ribs</i>
<i>alone is what every</i>

20
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:04,040
<i>red-blooded American would</i>
<i>rather be doing at all times.</i>

21
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:07,727
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better
to have someone to share the...

22
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,147
I mean, don't you
get lonely without...

23
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,266
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

24
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:17,628
Original Air Date on April 16, 2012

25
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:21,653

26
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,199
What's the best thing

27
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,752
about dating a stripper,
you ask?

28
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:30,736
Nope.

29
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:32,237
Just asked for your drink order.

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,956
I'll tell you the best thing
about dating a stripper.

31
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:34,923
He'll just have a scotch.

32
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,008
Getting to say,

33
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,926
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."

34
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:39,428
And I should go.

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,180
Time to make the doughnuts.

36
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,966
More like time to make some
dough sitting on some nuts.

37
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,050
She's a stripper.

38
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:46,051
I'm dating her.

39
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,269
I'm dating a stripper.
Barney wins.

40
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,187
I'll walk you out.

41
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,589
Hey, where are
you going?

42
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,191
Quinn needs to get to work.
She's a...

43
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:54,092
I know, a stripper, got it.

44
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,694
Hey, taxi!

45
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:58,897
My girlfriend's a stripper!

46
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,267
So, Ted, guess where we're
having dinner Friday night.

47
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,952
Chez L'Argent.

48
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,370
I am so excited.

49
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,406
We've been trying forever
to get this reservation.

50
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:09,291
Can you hold on
for just one second?

51
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:10,659
What the hell
are you doing?

52
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,827
Nothing.

53
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,746
Did you say
you had to pee?

54
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,247
No.

55
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,082
But yeah, I do have to pee.

56
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,968
Man, this kid better be
real freakin' cute!

57
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:23,672
What was that all about?

58
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:25,641
Lily had a sex dream last night.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,427
Sex dream?
Do tell.

60
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:31,963
I was painting
the baby furniture...

61
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:35,684
Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:38,904
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:41,356
Hurry up,
before Marshall gets home.

64
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:43,525
Oh, oh...

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,198
Whoa!

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,199
I'm sorry, baby.

67
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,767
Were you asleep?

68
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,253
All pregnant ladies
have crazy sex dreams.

69
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,039
It's just her hormones
going berserk.

70
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,675
So who's responsible for her
rapid thigh movement this time?

71
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,710
Oh, my favorite was when
she banged George Washington.

72
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:05,163
I liked the three-way with
Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

73
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,549
Oh, he smurfed
the smurf out of her.

74
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:09,351
Yes, while The Cos
smurfed off in the corner.

75
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:11,303
We all remember.
But here's the thing.

76
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,673
When Lily has dirty dreams
about other people,

77
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,391
she always tells me.

78
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:17,709
But this time...

79
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,697
Sounds like you
had a crazy dream.

80
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,199
What was it about?

81
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:29,788
And then her face turned...

82
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,457
<i>vermilion.</i>

83
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,862
Just... you and me...

84
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:39,798
gettin' it on, monogamously.

85
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:45,470
Monoga-me-oh-my.

86
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,540
Not the rose quartz
of the slightly embarrassed,

87
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,426
or the tomato red
of the mildly abashed,

88
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:55,180
vermilion, the color
of carnal shame.

89
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,234
Can only mean one thing:

90
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,737
Lily dream-banged
someone we know.

91
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,323
Okay, you caught me
vermilion-handed.

92
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:07,743
The truth is, I've spent
the last five years

93
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,445
trying to inception
your wife.

94
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,531
That movie only came out
two years ago.

95
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:14,583
What movie?

96
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:16,535
You know who I bet it is?

97
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:18,120
Robin.

98
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,005
Already checked.

99
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,456
<i>Lily and I paid her a visit</i>

100
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,625
<i>at the new World Wide News</i>
<i>headquarters.</i>

101
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,594
And I'm so excited,
because I've been trying months

102
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,578
to get this reservation.

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,963
Can you hold on
just one second?

104
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,214
What the hell
are you doing?!

105
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,299
Nothing.

106
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,517
Nice photo.
Oh.

107
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,553
Your passport
must be enormous.

108
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,188
(chuckles)
Ugh.

109
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,758
You know, for the record,
I didn't want this.

110
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,060
Didn't want it,
did not approve it.

111
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:44,613
It's super embarrassing.

112
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,932
Hey, Merle.

113
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:50,385
So, uh, do you guys
want to come up and see my desk?

114
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,653
Yeah, why not?

115
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:53,205
Come on.

116
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,706
I.D.?

117
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,608
Oh. Um, that is me.

118
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,110
Ma'am, with all due respect,

119
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,413
you're a wee bit older
than that hottie.

120
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:03,632
For God sakes.

121
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:07,085
You know, here I am,
on national TV every day,

122
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,555
and still a guy who spends
his whole life sitting next to

123
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,925
a giant picture of me
has no idea who I am.

124
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,177
This isn't my whole life;
I'm in a band.

125
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,445
And we're gonna make it.

126
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,680
<i>And, kids, they did make it.</i>

127
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:21,049
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

128
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,819
<i>You know what, I'm probably not</i>
<i>going to get to that later.</i>

129
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:27,489
<i>They had one song,</i>
<i>it didn't suck, the end.</i>

130
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,025
You always said
it wasn't about being famous.

131
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,477
You just want to do
solid journalism, right?

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,079
Yeah, well...

133
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,281
Of course I want
to be famous!

134
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,649
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

135
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:38,834
I was a cabinhold name.

136
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:39,935
But here?

137
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,286
Don't need to see
your I.D., Merle.

138
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,955
Everyone knows
who you are.

139
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,256
You're Merle.

140
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:46,258
He was in one skit
in the Christmas party!

141
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:49,995
Uh, by the way,
how is Ted doing?

142
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,780
<i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

143
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,882
<i>I declared my love,</i>
<i>she turned me down,</i>

144
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:56,601
<i>we both moved out of</i>
<i>the apartment, and now...</i>

145
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:59,137
I haven't talked to him
since we... stopped talking.

146
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:02,307
He's pretty good.

147
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:03,558
Pretty good?

148
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,927
Last night, you ate
a box of Froot Loops

149
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,029
in your tighty whities.

150
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:10,032
No, I demolished
a box of Froot Loops,

151
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,784
fully nude.

152
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,203
Yeah, "pretty good" works.

153
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,372
Hey, Barney.

154
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,541
Hey, Lily.

155
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,997
Do you know
what this is about?

156
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:25,664
Uh-huh.

157
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,882
Do I want to know?

158
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,867
No, sorry, bro.

159
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,085
Damn it!

160
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,536
Okay, time
for my stuff.

161
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,755
Guys, I was sitting
at home last night,

162
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:36,391
and all of a sudden,
I had a piphany.

163
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,759
And my piphany
was this...

164
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,594
Actually, it's, uh,
it's "epiphany."

165
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:42,230
No, Ted, this
is <i>the</i> piphany.

166
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,598
And here it is:

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,903
Make... every...
night... legendary.

168
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,438
Guys, we've had

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,189
some pretty
legendary nights.

170
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,608
But we've also had some nights
that weren't so legendary.

171
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,778
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted
Made Us All Watch <i>Norbit.</i>

172
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,531
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady;
what's the problem?

173
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,166
That was Eddie Murphy?

174
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,168
The non-legendary
nights are done.

175
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,254
From here on in, every
single night of our lives

176
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,406
will be a night
we'll never forget.

177
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,459
Starting tonight.

178
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:14,412
Who's ready for the longest,
craziest adventure yet?!

179
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,265
Good.

180
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,751
The weak have been
weeded from our herd.

181
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,636
You ready to rock
and roll, Ted?

182
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,921
Yeah, I'm going home, too.

183
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,489
I'm sensing some costumes
coming up here

184
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,640
and I'd rather steer clear.

185
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:28,009
Ted, 20 years from now,

186
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,195
when you're all alone
and I'm President,

187
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:31,313
you're not
gonna remember

188
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,315
sitting around your
apartment doing nothing.

189
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,617
What you will remember
is that tonight,

190
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:38,019
this night...

191
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:41,256
was The Night We Started
a Mariachi Band!

192
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,125
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro!</i>

193
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,617
Okay, you were right.

194
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,802
Memorable night.

195
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:55,954
That was nothing
compared to <i>mañana,</i> amigo.

196
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,006
Because <i>mañana</i> is gonna be...

197
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,458
The Night We Ate Everything
on the Menu!

198
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,980
A really memorable night.

199
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,131
But tomorrow night...

200
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,251
Is The Night We Brought
a Horse into the Bar!

201
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,737
Okay, but tomorrow...

202
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:16,425
Is The Night We Bungee Jump
off the Statue of Liberty!

203
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,079
Nope.

204
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,281
<i>That night was the night</i>
<i>of Aunt Lily</i>

205
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,033
<i>and Uncle Marshall's</i>
<i>fancy dinner.</i>

206
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:28,153
Complete with a fancy limo ride.

207
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:29,121
Surprise!

208
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,288
Hello!

209
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,941
Hi, Ranjit.

210
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,629
No.

211
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:47,031
Should I take the
West Side Highway?

212
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,999
Why not, Ranjit?

213
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,135
Don't you always just
take whatever you want,

214
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,037
regardless of
anything but your own

215
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,590
dirty, sick,
twisted appetites?

216
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:02,129
I'll stay on Broadway.

217
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:04,631
I.D.?

218
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,934
For God's sakes, open your...

219
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,053
Yeah, that's about right.

220
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,688
I.D.?

221
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,773
<i>Robin had finally</i>
<i>learned the lesson</i>

222
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,858
<i>that nobody</i>
<i>gets famous overnight.</i>

223
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,393
<i>But here's the crazy part:</i>

224
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,428
<i>that night, she got famous.</i>

225
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,596
Robin, there you are.

226
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:20,931
Sandy Rivers!

227
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,066
Star of the show.

228
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,118
What it is, my man.
Yeah.

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,786
Robin, I've got
something big for you,

230
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,538
something huge.

231
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,473
And I want you on it.

232
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,609
Sandy, you were
<i>in</i> the harassment video.

233
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:33,944
You were great in that,
by the way.

234
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:34,945
Thanks, holmes.

235
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:36,246
And I like the way

236
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:38,215
your filthy little mind works,
Robin, but this is real.

237
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,166
Big story's breaking.

238
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:40,801
Are you afraid of helicopters?

239
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:42,452
I love helicopters.

240
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:44,972
What am I covering, a war?
Better!

241
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:48,409
<i>World Wide News</i>
<i>brings you the world.</i>

242
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,394
<i>And now Robin Scherbatsky</i>
<i>with traffic.</i>

243
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,298
You don't want to go
bungee jumping, fine.

244
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,301
Tonight's The Night
We Stole a Mummy

245
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,738
from the Natural History Museum!

246
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,974
Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

247
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:08,412
Then get out your MetroCard,
Ted, because tonight's

248
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:11,314
The Night We Partied
with the Mole People!

249
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,652
Barney, I have a Stouffer's
lasagna for one in the freezer

250
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:17,371
that is going to be
unforgettable.

251
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,506
I have a <i>Sanford and Son</i>
on my DVR

252
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:22,209
that I will take with me
to my grave.

253
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,928
I don't need tonight to be
any more memorable than that.

254
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,848
Okay, <i>Sanford and Son</i>
does sound good.

255
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,685
But if I could just present
a counter argument...

256
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,523
You're locked out, dummy!

257
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,308
Damn it! Barney!

258
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,343
Give me your phone;
I'm calling my super.

259
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:42,846
The only person we're calling
is everyone we know,

260
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:46,150
because tonight's The Night
We Tracked Down Phil Collins,

261
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,852
Became Best Friends with Him,
and Talked Him into Reuniting

262
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:51,205
with Peter Gabriel,
So Then We Got to Sing Backup

263
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,108
On The New Genesis Album
and It Was Awesome!

264
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,194
Fine, I'll use the
phone at the bar.

265
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:02,416
Ranjit, would you please
put up the partition?

266
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:05,419
Partition going up.

267
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,537
You had a sex dream
about Ranjit!

268
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,039
Hello.

269
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,474
Ranjit!

270
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:12,042
Sorry.

271
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:14,044
Okay, yes, I did,

272
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,763
but it didn't
mean anything.

273
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:19,016
Okay, well, what
happened in this dream?

274
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,383
And I want to
know everything.

275
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:21,718
Every explicit detail.

276
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,070
Don't leave out any...

277
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,822
Damn it, Ranjit!

278
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:26,824
Sorry.

279
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:30,194
Marshall, it was a dream.

280
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,578
Yeah, well, dreams
are just stuff

281
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,864
that you subconsciously
want to happen.

282
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,499
Why do you think
I'm constantly dreaming

283
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,400
about Bigfoot playing
quarterback for the Vikings?

284
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:40,671
Because you fall asleep
looking at a painting of it.

285
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,172
It soothes me.

286
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:44,541
Don't try to change the subject.

287
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:46,460
You sleep-cheated.

288
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,578
You've been
sleep-sleeping around,

289
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,763
and I'm sick of it.

290
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,215
You know,
I have half a mind

291
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,267
to get out and let you
eat all by yourself.

292
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:55,552
Should I pull over?

293
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,753
Damn it, Ranjit!

294
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,106
Yes, Ranjit.
Pull over.

295
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,442
Pulling over.

296
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:03,610
You watch, Ted.

297
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:06,263
Tonight is going
to be legen--

298
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,348
it's the night
we stole a camel...

299
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:13,487
...which means it'll be
full of drama-- dary.

300
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,455
Dromedary!

301
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:19,042
I applaud your wordplay,
but your core premise is flawed.

302
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,211
Every night
can't be legendary.

303
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,748
If all nights are legendary,
no nights are legendary.

304
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,035
See, Ted,
that attitude right there,

305
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,736
that's why I'm in the lead.

306
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,088
What do you mean, in the lead?

307
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,956
I'm talking about
the game of life, Ted.

308
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,091
Scoreboard.

309
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,143
Better wardrobe:
75 points.

310
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,679
Apartment on a higher floor:
90 points.

311
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,365
Longer name: 110 points.

312
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,433
Sorry. Did you just make up
this point system?

313
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,702
Made up the point system:
114 points.

314
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,804
And ten points to you
for pointing that out.

315
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:49,139
Nice job, Ted.

316
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:51,225
15 points to me
for being gracious enough

317
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:52,593
to give you those ten points.

318
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:53,827
But here's the point, Ted.

319
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:54,995
Every time I go out

320
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,213
and have an awesome night

321
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:57,347
and you're not there,

322
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,982
that's another 100 points
in my column.

323
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:01,051
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

324
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,837
Barney, the fact that I
can stay home for a night

325
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,156
shows that I have inner peace

326
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:08,208
and that I don't feel
the need to keep score.

327
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,876
That's worth like
1,000 points right there,

328
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:12,546
so at the very
least, we're tied.

329
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,431
We're so not tied.

330
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,866
Although you know
what is tied--

331
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:18,135
the strap
of my girlfriend's bikini.

332
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,137
Except when it's not,
'cause she's a stripper.

333
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,838
One million points!
Game.

334
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,273
Shh.

335
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,358
It's over.

336
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,326
It's done. It's done.

337
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,679
So what do you do?

338
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,014
You're kidding, right?

339
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:32,816
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

340
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:35,118
I just did a report
like five minutes ago.

341
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,853
You sound frustrated.

342
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,188
Yeah, I am.

343
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,192
I'm busting my ass,
and as usual, no recognition.

344
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:45,295
Robin, I've been
doing this a while,

345
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,798
and if there's one thing
I've learned, it's flarm.

346
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,916
What?
Flarm.

347
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,868
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

348
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,420
Blobbum.

349
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:55,305
What is wrong with you?

350
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:56,923
Are you having a stroke?

351
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:58,708
<i>As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

352
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,427
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

353
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,828
<i>Meanwhile, Lily was in</i>

354
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,014
<i>desperate need</i>
<i>of a female friend.</i>

355
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,983
Lily, I have seen this
a million times.

356
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,518
Guys go crazy when there's
a baby on the way.

357
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,887
You should have seen the manager
when his wife got pregnant.

358
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:14,524
After the second trimester,
he made her stop stripping.

359
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,860
Yeah, you're right.

360
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,412
Now I feel bad.

361
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:19,896
Our big dinner's been ruined.

362
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:22,416
Marshall's
probably crying right now.

363
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,168
I had no idea that
food could be this delicious.

364
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,238
Marshall, you are being crazy.

365
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
No, no, I can handle it.

366
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,574
If I sell my laptop,

367
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,378
we can get seconds
on those squash blossoms.

368
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,762
I mean about Lily.

369
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:39,132
Well, you know,
she's being crazy, too.

370
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,250
She's pregnant.

371
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,685
She gets to be crazy.

372
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,687
You have to be the sane one.

373
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,522
So what, I don't get to be
crazy again

374
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:46,756
until the baby comes?

375
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,893
No. Then it's baby's turn
to be crazy.

376
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,595
When do I get to be crazy again?

377
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,097
Never.

378
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,704
We are totally even.

379
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,823
We absolutely are not even,
and here's why.

380
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,374
I'll grant you
that if you include

381
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,910
the 12 points
for designing the skyscraper,

382
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:09,212
the 83 points for slapping five
with Tommy Lee

383
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:12,265
and the 9,000 points
for banging Robin before me,

384
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,935
our point totals
would be about neck and neck,

385
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,837
but there's one thing
you're forgetting.

386
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,088
The fact that I don't care?

387
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,439
No.

388
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:21,942
And you just lost five points
for sass.

389
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:25,929
Do you remember a conversation
we had about three years ago?

390
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:28,348
Barney, you're
the king.

391
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,900
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

392
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,151
You're handsome,

393
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:32,986
debonair,

394
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,072
everything I wish I could be.

395
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,773
I'm starting to think
this never happened.

396
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,792
Let you finish.

397
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:41,311
You're smooth,
charismatic,

398
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,279
"sauve."

399
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:43,780
I think you mean "suave."

400
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,015
Aha.

401
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:47,167
So you do remember.

402
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,452
But there's one thing

403
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:51,321
even a master ladies' man
like you could never do,

404
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:52,923
and if you could
ever do it,

405
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,925
it would be worth 500 points.

406
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,712
You have my attention,
my slightly shorter friend.

407
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,297
Here's the challenge.

408
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,451
Get a girl's phone number
while you're wearing a dress.

409
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:09,022
Challenge...

410
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,724
Accomplished.

411
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:11,808
That's right.

412
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,477
Last year,
I slapped on a dress,

413
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,345
took a few laps
around this very bar,

414
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:16,847
and I got this:

415
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,516
the phone number
of one Stephanie McColgan.

416
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:22,685
Later that night,
I took off my pantyhose,

417
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,372
and gave her panties...
my hose.

418
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:26,689
That's right, Ted.

419
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,992
I am 500 points ahead.

420
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,961
Until you can get
a girl's digits

421
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:34,531
while wearing a dress,
you and I will never be even.

422
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,466
You know what? The super's
probably waiting for me,

423
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:38,251
and I just remembered
there's a spare key

424
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,003
under the doormat, so good night.
Wait, wait.

425
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:41,371
Ted, don't go.
Barney, I am leaving.

426
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,507
I'm afraid this is just
one of those nights

427
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,142
we're probably going to forget.

428
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:47,010
I don't think so, dude. Look.

429
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:48,595
If you're just joining us,
the World Wide News

430
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,214
Eye in the Sky traffic chopper
is out of control over Manhattan

431
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:53,283
and being piloted
by our own Robin Scherbatsky.

432
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:55,485
This probably won't end well.

433
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,698
<i>Kids, every now and then,</i>
<i>New York has a moment</i>

434

435
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,921

436
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:08,774

439
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:18,634
I did it.

440
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,053
I did it!

441
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:30,729

Thank you so much.

445
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,207

Hey, Lil.

456
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,129
Hey, Barney.

457
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:06,565
Yes, I know
you're dating a stripper.

458
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,933
Mm-hmm.

459
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,435
Hey, Dad.

460
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:11,937
You proud of your little girl?

461
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,992
Okay, I'll keep trying.

462
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:20,829
Babe, I think
I know why you had

463
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:23,532
that sex dream about Ranjit.
Why?

464
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:24,833
Think about it.

465
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,835
The way he talks
about his kids.

466
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,820
He's a wonderful father.

467
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:32,458
Just like Papa Smurf,
Bill Cosby...

468
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,294
George Washington,
the father of our country.

469
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:38,297
You're attracted
to great dads.

470
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,132
And that's why you love me.

471
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:43,669
Because I'm going to be
the greatest dad ever.

472
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,188
Sure, that must be it.

473
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,840
<i>Lily decided</i>

Why can't we just go home?

486
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,832
I can't go home, Ted.
Why not?

487
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:17,002
Because...
I'm dating a stripper.

No, you don't.

00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,845

and who she is doing it on.

495

to take my mind off of it...

You're lucky that you can just
go sit around the house, Ted.
