1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:04,440
氦
Helium.

00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:06,276
- 对了  - 是吧
- Yes.  - Yes.

00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:08,244
这是Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift.

4
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:09,379
没错
Yes.

5

圆周率
Pi.

6
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,050
对了
Yes.

7
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:20,323
她姓卡戴珊
Kardashian.

8
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,091
叫什么?
More specific.

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:25,962
科勒?
Khloe?

10
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:27,297
对了!
Yes!

11
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,331
看吧 我记住了
See, I remembered

12
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,066
因为我发现 长得像金的 就是金
because if it looks like Kim it's Kim,

13
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:31,634
如果长得有点像金 那就是考特妮
if it looks kind of like Kim it's Kourtney,

14
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,336
如果长得完全不像金 那就是科勒
and if it looks nothing like Kim it's Khloe.

15
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:34,537
好吧
Oh.

16
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,738
哦
Oh,

17
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,774
这是文氏图解 我记得是因为
that's a Venn Diagram, and I remember because

18
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,108
我一直在想
I thought to myself,

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,110
"他什么时候能别再说这个图了?"
"Venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"

20
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,110
{\an8} "文氏"与英语中"什么时候"谐音

21
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,781
- 你们干嘛呢?  - 这个嘛
- What are you guys doing?  - Oh, well,

22
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:46,683
我们决定利用早餐的时间
we decided to use our breakfast time

23
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,319
帮助对方 扩大自己的领域的知识面
to expand our respective knowledge bases.

24
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,553
让我试试
Oh, let me try.

25
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,622
好啊
Okay.

26
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:56,292
呃 氢原子 Maroon 5的Adam 跪安吧
Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.

27
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:56,292
{\an8} 魔力红是美国摇滚乐队 Adam为歌手之一

28
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,297
那个 谁是跪安?
I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,801
对了 Penny 你一会能不能和我一起
Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport

30
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,135
去机场接我妈妈?
with me later to pick up my mother?

31
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:07,170
- 好啊  - 谢了
- Sure.  - Thanks.

32
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,604
- 没什么  - 还有 Penny
- No problem.  - Hey, Penny,

33
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,273
那个 反正你也要去机场 
um, since you're already gonna be at the airport,

34
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:11,441
那我还用去吗?
do I need to go?

35
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:15,311
你为什么不想去机场接你妈妈?
Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?

36
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:17,180
如果她不会一路上整整四十分钟都在
Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride

37
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:19,282
全方位地吐槽我的话 其实我也挺想去接她的
where she criticizes every aspect of my life.

38
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:22,785
四十分钟就够她吐槽你的了?
She can cover it in a car ride?

39
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,688
你的站姿就够我吐槽四十分钟的
I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.

40
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:27,890
你真的想让我
You really want me to pick up

41
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:28,891
一个人去接你妈妈?
your mother all by myself?

42
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,626
我是觉得
Hmm, I just feel like

43
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:32,362
你们正好可以借此增进感情
it would be a good chance for you to bond.

44
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:33,963
还是你可以借此避免和她接触?
Or a way for you to avoid her?

45
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:36,265
我不知道他在卡片上写了什么
I don't know what he's putting on those cards,

46
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,568
但是你真的比以前聪明了
but you are smarter than ever.

47
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,738
好吧 你要是真的不想去 我去接就好了
Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.

48
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,839
真的?
Seriously?

49
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,440
是啊 她是我婆婆嘛
Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law,

50
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:46,509
我也希望我们能和谐相处
and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.

51
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,444
你真的好成熟啊
That is very mature of you,

52
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,280
而我就可以继续怂下去了
so I'm gonna go ahead and say, "Suckah."

53
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:54,050
- 好了 继续学习吧  - 好
- All right, back to learning.  - Okay.

54
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,720
这个简单 这是教科学的比尔
Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.

55
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,720
{\an8}"比尔教科学"是美国一档科教节目

56
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,955
不过我把他称为...
Or as I know him...

57
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:01,624
"'与星共舞'里的怪老头"
"Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars."

58
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:06,729
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state  *

59
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,066
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  *

60
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,701
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool  *

61
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,237
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  *

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,906
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids  *

63
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:19,575
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery  *

64
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,477
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang  *

65
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,446

你们知不知道有一场复仇者电影的放映会?
Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening?

70
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,931
Joss Whedon会在现场展示一些被删减的片段
Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes

71
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,931
{\an8 "复仇者联盟2"导演}

72
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:38,698
还有问答环节
and do a question and answer session.

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,633
我倒真有几个关于上一部复仇者电影的问题
Oh, well, I have a few questions for him

74
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:44,337
想要问他... 当然我已经有很多答案了
about the last Avengers movie... and a whole lot of answers.

75
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:47,040
什么时候放映?
When's the screening?

76
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,042
就在今晚 不过座位是先到先得的
Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served,

77
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,010
所以我们应该早点去排队
so we should probably get there early and wait in line.

78
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,979
好啊
Let's do it. 

79
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,547
Penny在陪我妈呢 加我一个
Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.

80
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,182
哦 不好意思啊 
Oh, bad news.

81
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,251
Amy逼我陪她去逛街
Amy's making me go shopping with her later,

82
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,653
所以我们都去不了了
so looks like none of us can go.

83
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:05,792
我们又不是没有你就不能出去玩了
You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you?

84
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:08,361
其实没有你我们才能玩的开心
In fact, that's usually the trick to it.

85
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,798
我们得什么时候到?
What time do we need to get there?

86
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,399
呃 大概三点钟吧
Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

87
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,201
你们真的要抛下我去吗?
You're really going without me?

88
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,202
这又没什么的
It's not a big deal.

89
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,504
你去陪Amy逛街
Go shopping with Amy,

90
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:18,905
我们会帮你留一个位子的
and we'll save a spot in line for you.

91
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,975
你又没有权利给任何人留位子
You don't have the authority to save places in the line.

92
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,276
如果我这样做的话 我就是插队了
If I do that, I'll be cutting.

93
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,111
大家都这么做的
People do it all the time.

94
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:26,679
排队的黄金法则就是
You know the golden rule of line etiquette:

95
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,149
"乱插队的没屁眼"
"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."

96
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:31,151
如果你那么在乎这件事的话
If you really care that much,

97
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,853
你可以下一个手机软件 雇人帮你干事
there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff

98
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:36,022
比如买菜排队什么的
like errands and wait in lines.

99
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,192
还真的有人工作就是去排队?
People are actually waiting in lines as a job?

100
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:43,596
听到这种事我自我感觉好多了
Boy, makes me feel better about my life.

101
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,598
有些人一个小时就能赚20美元呢
Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.

102
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,901
这下子我感觉又不好了
And now I feel worse again.

103
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:53,506
我早就预料到Leonard会不来接我的
I'm not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up.

104
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,510
他一辈子都不习惯亲密关系
He's battled intimacy issues his whole life.

105
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:01,047
他持续勃起有困难吗?
Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?

106
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,383
哇
Wow.

107
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,351
连停车场都还没开出去呢
Didn't even make it out of the parking lot.

108
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,854
呃 要不我们别聊Leonard了
Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard.

109
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,122
我们聊聊你吧
Let's talk about you.

110
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,890
你这几天在这里想干什么?
What would you like to do while you're here?

111
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:12,792
亲爱的 我是精神病医生
Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

112
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,795
你不需要避免和我进行亲密的交谈的
You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.

113
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,199
我其实是希望我们能亲密一些的
Well, I'd actually like for us to be close,

114
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:21,167
但是我们能不能从最喜欢看的书开始聊起
but maybe we start with our favorite books

115
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,770
最后再讨论我丈夫的性器官
and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.

116
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,973
可以啊
Very well.

117
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,141
你最近看什么书呢?
What's the last book you read?

118
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,845
{\an8}家居杂志

119
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,845
呃 陶器室春季特刊算吗?
Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?

120
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,916
Penny 你希望你的婆婆喜欢你 这是很自然的心理
Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you,

121
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,086
我知道有时候我让人害怕
and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person.

122
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:43,823
我要怎么样才能让你轻松一点呢?
So what can I do to make this process easier for you?

123
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,124
呃 你能不能
Uh, for starters,

124
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,260
不要用心理学分析我说的每一句话?
maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?

125
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,596
那我用心理学分析你说的话的时候
And how does it make you feel

126
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:52,665
你是什么感受呢?
when I psychoanalyze everything you say?

127
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,034
非常不舒服
Uncomfortable.

128
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,302
我开玩笑呢 亲爱的
That was a joke, dear.

129
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,871
哦 对不起
Oh. Sorry.

130
00:04:57,873 --> 00:04:59,672
没想到你还会开玩笑
Didn't know you made those.

131
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,109
嘿 要不我们婆媳俩今天晚上
Hey, listen, what if we have a little

132
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,112
一起吃一顿晚饭吧?
mother-in-law-daughter-in-law dinner tonight?

133
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:08,147
就我们两个人吗?
So just the two of us?

134
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:10,683
要不我再请几个朋友来吧
Or I invite a few girlfriends,

135
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,085
刚刚你说"就我们两个人"的时候
'cause hearing you say "the two of us"

136
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,354
我突然就寒毛直竖了
just sent a chill right down my spine.

137
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
嘿
Hey.

138
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,295
你来干什么?
What are you doing here?

139
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,296
你又不是Sheldon
You're not Sheldon.

140
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:26,165
我就知道你会问这个问题
I thought that might come up.

141
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:29,302
Sheldon雇我陪你去逛街
Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.

142
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:31,204
等等
Hold on.

143
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,240
他付钱给你就为了不和我一起出门?
He paid you to get out of spending time with me?

144
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,542
也不是这样啦
No, it's not like that.

145
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,312
他是需要去排个队
There's a long line he'd rather stand in.

146
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,649
那我们去干什么呢? 买衣服还是买玩具?
So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear?

147
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,250
我反正都能拿钱
I get paid either way.

148
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,354
我不会陪你去逛街的
We're not going shopping together.

149
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,356
你确定吗? 我能帮你提包啊
You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag.

150
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,293
Sheldon还给我了一点钱让我去买热狗香肠呢
And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.

151
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,230
你知道我现在为什么不高兴吗?
Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?

152
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,234
小姐 我只是来干活的
Look, lady, I just work here.

153
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:07,540
我们一起排过很多队 是吧?
We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?

154
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,108
还记得我们参加的那次
Remember when we camped out

155
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,777
动漫大会上的神秘博士主题露营吗?
for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?

156
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,779
是啊 和其他粉丝一起睡在星空下
Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans

157
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,480
分享着我们共同热爱的东西
who love the show as much as we do.

158
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:17,717
醒过来之后想着到底是谁偷了我们的钱包
Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,454
Stuart 你在这里干什么?
Stuart, what are you doing here?

160
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:23,423
Sheldon 你真是我这辈子见过的
Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person

161
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,326
最无良的人了!
I have ever met in my entire life!

162
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,028
你怎么能通过打发我过去
Where do you get off sending me

163
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,230
来逃避和你女朋友的约会呢?
to shop with your girlfriend?!

164
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:32,532
我不明白你的意思
I don't understand.

165
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,033
我之前雇你的时候你可是很开心的
You were happy to do this when I hired you.

166
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,635
为什么... 为什么现在反倒对我有意见了?
Why... why are you upset with me now?

167
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,972
噢 我没有意见 但是Amy现在大发雷霆
Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

168
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:43,276
所以她雇我让你尝尝这种滋味
so she hired me to let you have it.

169
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,046
好吧 礼尚往来 很公平
Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.

170
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,983
公你妹的平啊 你个自私的混蛋!
You're darn right it's fair play, you selfish jerk!

171
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,355
你知道吗 每当我以为
You know, just when I think

172
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:56,889
我们的关系有所进展的时候
we're making progress in our relationship,

173
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,524
我们又回到了老样子
we revert to our old patterns

174
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,226
任何想法和感受都难以言表
where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.

175
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,894
我想说 如果他不愿意和我一起去购物
I mean, if he didn't want to go shopping with me,

176
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,363
为什么不直接说出来呢?
why didn't he just say so?

177
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:07,266
说不定他插不上嘴
Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.

178
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,938
抱歉 我一直说个不停
I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.

179
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,573
没关系 亲爱的
Oh, it's all right, dear.

180
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:16,542
Sheldon的思维不但机智还很复杂
Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind.

181
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,579
和他发展一段男女关系很艰难
It's understandable that being in a relationship with him

182
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,813
是可以理解的
could be trying.

183
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,248
有一次我叫他"宝贝儿"
I called him "babe" once.

184
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,051
他问我是不是磕药了
He asked me to get a drug test.

185
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,521
我欣赏你的决心
Well, I do admire your resolve.

186
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:31,157
你是一个了不起的女人 谢谢你
You're an extraordinary woman. Thank you.

187
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,526
你知道 她是我的婆婆
You know, she's my mother-in-law.

188
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,261
为什么我不能和她这么和谐呢?
Why can't I bond with her like that?

189
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:38,664
她把Sheldon当亲生儿子看待
Amy's with Sheldon who she loves like a son.

190
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,500
你虽然和他儿子在一起
You're with her son...

191
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,269
但她没那么上心
who she doesn't.

192
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:46,305
你能想象我用了五年时间才让他帮我按摩按摩吗?
Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?

193
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:49,976
Sheldon能这么做已经跨出一大步了
Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.

194
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,978
三分钟
Three minutes.

195
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,981
他还用了厨房计时器
And he used a kitchen timer.

196
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,417
我感觉自己就像一个半熟的鸡蛋
I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

197
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
知道吗 和Leonard在一起
You know, being in a relationship with Leonard

198
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,056
也是有很多挑战的
also comes with its challenges.

199
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,390
是的
Yes.

200
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:07,760
不过 有什么办法呢?
Well, what can you do?

201
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,299
说不定是Sheldon来道歉的
Maybe it's Sheldon, here to say he's sorry.

202
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:16,135
Sheldon说他很抱歉
Sheldon says he's sorry.

203
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,374
Bernadette 我给你五块钱把门砸上
Bernadette, I'll give you five dollars to slam the door.

204
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,975
我只要三块钱就行了
I would have done it for three.

205
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,426
天哪 一直在这儿站着真累人
Boy, all this standing's making me tired.

206
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:39,296
还好我带了折叠拐杖椅
Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.

207
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:41,899
别提折叠拐杖椅了
Not the stick chair.

208
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,667
你坐在上面就像个傻子
You look like an idiot on that thing.

209
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,036
棍子和石头会让我骨折
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

210
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,939
但是棍子上的小椅子可是很舒服的哦
but chairs on sticks are comfy.

211
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,542
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

212
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,711
和Amy一切顺利吗?
Is everything smoothed out with Amy?

213
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,579
不 她还是很生气
Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

214
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,916
你有向我一样真诚地道歉了吗?
Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?

215
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,552
我说了"Sheldon说他很抱歉"
I said, "Sheldon says he's sorry."

216
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:04,455
你这么说又有点夸张了
Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.

217
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:09,126
你觉得是时候你自己去和她道歉了吗?
You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?

218
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,694
我想是吧
I suppose so.

219
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,585
但如果我现在走了的话 我就拿不到位子了
But if I get out of the line, I'll lose my spot.

220
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,186
我很乐意在你回来之前帮你占位
I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.

221
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,488
你愿意吗?
You would do that?

222
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,857
考虑到这样我就能从你这里赚更多的钱 是的
Consider it my way of getting more of your money.

223
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,727
你真是个好人
You're a good man.

224
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,497
Beverly 你知道Penny
So, Beverly, did you know Penny

225
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,165
是我们制药公司
is the number three sales rep

226
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,767
排行前三的销售代表吗?
at our pharmaceutical company?

227
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,802
哦 我不知道你们在一起工作
Oh, I didn't realize you two work together.

228
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,137
呃 严格来说不是的
Well, we don't exactly. 

229
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,272
我是研究组的微生物学家
I'm a microbiologist for the research team.

230
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,774
那你现在研究什么呢
Oh, what are you currently developing?

231
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,809
一些新型的抗焦虑药
Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.

232
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,110
很有意思
That's interesting.

233
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,213
我刚参加了一个关于儿童焦虑的讲座
I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.

234
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,716
是雅诺斯基博士的讲座吗?
Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski?

235
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,784
我刚看了他的TED讲话!
I just saw his TED Talk!

236
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,018
就是他
It was.

237
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,653
还是说说Penny吧
Let's get back to Penny.

238
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,954
你不是刚要告诉我
Hey, weren't you telling me

239
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,489
你公司配车的事情吗?
something great about your company car?

240
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,957
呃..
Um...

241
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,663
车上配有座位供暖
It has seat warmers.

242
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,600
Amy! 开门 Amy!
Amy! Amy!

243
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,302
- 开门 Amy!  - 进来
- Amy!  - Come in.

244
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,937
大家好
Hello, everyone.

245
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,339
Beverly 见到你真好!
Oh, Beverly, good to see you!

246
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,107
很想跟你聊聊 可我还要排队
I'd love to chat, but there's a line

247
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,975
队伍马上就要开始向前移动了 所以就这么着吧
that could start moving any minute, so let's do this.

248
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,110
Amy?听我说
Amy?

249
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,045
恰当的道歉有三个步骤
A proper apology requires three steps.

250
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,247
第一步 认错
Step one-- an admission of wrong doing.

251
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,183
Amy 我错了 第二步...
Amy, I was wrong. Step two...

252
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,318
承诺不再犯错
a promise never to repeat said action.

253
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,021
Amy 我不会再那么干了 我承诺
Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that's a promise.

254
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,523
第三步... 诚恳的请求原谅
Step three... an earnest request for forgiveness.

255
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,791
Amy 我希望你能原谅我
Amy, I hope you can forgive me.

256
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,059
而且希望你现在就能原谅我
And I hope you do it right now,

257
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,427
因为下面还有车等着我呢
'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs,

258
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,062
而且我也不想跟我的司机Ganesh
and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense

259
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,198
再道歉一次
with my driver Ganesh.

260
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,735
好吧
Fine.

261
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,336
谢谢! 你真善解人意!
Oh, thanks! You're a peach!

262
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,537
Beverly 我们以后再聊
Beverly, we'll catch up soon.

263
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,839
Bernadette 很高兴见到你
Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always,

264
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,407
Penny 你牙齿上有根菠菜
Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.

265
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,746
我牙齿上那个菠菜有多长时间了?
How long have I had spinach in my teeth?

266
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,214
机场见到你的时候就有
Since the airport, dear.

267
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,254
你看起来像身后长了根支架
You look like you come with a kickstand.

268
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,556
你没法让我觉得不舒服
You can't make me feel bad.

269
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,859
也许不能 Leonard你上
Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?

270
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,728
外星人把你送回来的时候
So, when the aliens brought you back,

271
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,097
忘了把探测器取出来?
they just left the probe in?

272
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,000
我回来了
I'm back.

273
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,969
- 怎么样了?  - 挺好的
- Hey, how'd it go?  - It went well.

274
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,804
我发现如果你从来不道歉
Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry,

275
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:16,408
你真道歉的时候会让他们很不自在
the times you do really puts them on their heels.

276
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,977
Stuart 你现在可以走了
Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.

277
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,279
我走之前还有谁有什么事情吗?
Anyone else need anything before I go?

278
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,282
如果能取笑一下Raj我就给你一块钱
I'll give you a dollar if make fun of Raj.

279
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,751
- 太小气了  - 那五块
- That's mean.  - Five.

280
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,320
如果老虎看起来像傻子 那你就看起来像老虎
You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.

281
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,391
如果你需要有人写推荐信
Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything,

282
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,460
我很愿意帮忙
just let me know.

283
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,061
大家好
Hey, guys.

284
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,263
你来了
You made it.

285
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,465
你看见了吗?
Did you see that?

286
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,634
他刚插队了
He just cut the line.

287
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,235
他和朋友一起呢 没事的
He's just joining his friends; it's fine.

288
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,804
不行 这是不对的
No, it's not fine.

289
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,106
这违反了排队的原则
It is a breach of line etiquette.

290
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,574
我们排在队伍前面
We're near the front of the line.

291
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,975
怎么着都进得去
We'll get in either way.

292
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,877
如果我们前面的每个人都让人插队会怎么样?
What if every person in front of us lets someone cut?

293
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,417
我们还是进得去
We'd still get in.

294
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,380
如果插队的那些人再让人插队会怎么样?
What if each of those people let someone cut?

295
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,065
还是进得去
Still get in.

296
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,550
如果那些新插进来的人继续让人插队呢?
But then each of those people let someone cut?

297
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,484
还是进得去 不过进去之前
We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you

298
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,786
我会先用他的折凳敲你脑袋
over the head with his stick chair.

299
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,490
- 请听我说  - 别啊
- Excuse me.  - Oh, please don't.

300
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,725
呃 我一不小心就
Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice

301
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,461
看到你插队了
that you cut the line.

302
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,728
我是跟我朋友一起的
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends.

303
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,729
不用你操心
It's cool.

304
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,931
不行
Well, no.

305
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,466
我必须要操心
It's not cool.

306
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,801
如果座位都是需要提前预约的
If there were reserved seating,

307
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,703
而且我们都有票的话 那就没事
and we all had tickets, that would be fine.

308
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,138
但是这是先到先得的
But this line is first-come, first-served.

309
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,540
而不是"晚到先得"
Not "show up tardy and nevertheless be first served".

310
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,808
来 击个掌
Right here.

311
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,010
不要
No.

312
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,414
你必须要排到后面去
You need to go to the back of the line.

313
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,250
谁说你是队伍管理员了?
Uh, who made you line monitor?

314
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,220
四年级的时候 Wunch女士钦点的我
Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

315
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,889
我的宣言是"只要是笔直的队伍
And my slogan was "a line that's straight

316
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,058
就是好队伍"
is a line that's great"

317
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,794
这货是在认真的?
Is this guy for real?

318
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,464
我多想说不是的
Boy, I wish I could say no.

319
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,502
Sheldon能道歉还是很不错的
That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.

320
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,604
是的 他是变了很多
Well, he's come a long way.

321
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,206
或许花很久时间变了很少
Or a short way very slowly,

322
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,643
所以感觉是变了很多
so it feels like a long way.

323
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,346
你俩的关系真是太好了
Your relationship with him is fascinating.

324
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,282
我正在准备写一本高质量情侣的书
I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples,

325
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,217
我想对你俩做个访谈
and I would love to interview the both of you.

326
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,619
可以啊
Oh, sure.

327
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,420
我会... 我会跟Sheldon说这事儿的
I'll... I'll talk to Sheldon about it.

328
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,489
你知不知道Bernadette的老公原来是宇航员
You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.

329
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,258
真的?
Really?

330
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,359
你觉得他愿不愿意
Do you think he would be interested

331
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,593
一起来做访谈?
in being interviewed as well?

332
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,128
我还需要问他愿不愿意?
Do I think he'd be interested?

333
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,030
有时候他在洗澡的时候
Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed

334
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,999
我就听见他在假装被访谈呢
when he's alone in the bathroom.

335
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,001
完美!
Wonderful!

336
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,270
我会给你联系方式的
I'll give you my contact information.

337
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,474
呃 你应该也问问Penny
Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.

338
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,744
问她啥?
About what?

339
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,712
够了 你知道不?
Okay, you know what?

340
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,314
这太傻了
This is ridiculous.

341
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,448
我一整天都在想着
I've been trying to make

342
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,583
能和你的关系更进一步
a connection with you all day,

343
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,851
很明显 没有什么用
and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

344
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,953
你是想要一种关系
Well, are you seeking a connection

345
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,589
还是仅仅就是认可?
or just some form of validation?

346
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,225
我想要的是一种友谊
What I was seeking was some sort of friendship.

347
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,794
但是现在 你不羞辱我就行了
But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.

348
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,130
我从来没想过羞辱你啊
My intention was never to insult you.

349
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,498
但是你整天都在!
You've been doing it all day!

350
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,199
你到底知不知道什么叫做羞辱?!
Do you even know what an insult is?!

351
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,168
显然它不是个医学术语
Well, it's not a clinical term.

352
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,871
但是一个例子就是你嫁给了我的儿子
But one example would be your marrying my son,

353
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,573
但是却没有邀请我去婚礼 甚至都没有告诉我
and not inviting me or even telling me

354
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,374
你们都要办婚礼了
the wedding was taking place.

355
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,379
好吧 好例子
Okay, good example.

356
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,986
那你觉得Joss Whedon会让破坏规矩和插队的人
What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay

357
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,986
 {\an8}Joss Whedon为复仇者联盟系列导演编剧

358
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,021
来看他的作品吗?!
with rule-breakers and line-cutters?!

359
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,823
复仇者联盟本来就是打破规矩的人!
The Avengers are rule-breakers!

360
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,893
充满报复心理就是他们的职责!
Being vengeful is in their job description!

361
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,662
他们是为神盾局工作
They work for SHIELD,

362
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,898
神盾局是被美国政府所管辖的!
which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government!

363
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,566
你是在美国政府管辖的
Do you work for a sanctioned department

364
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,301
部门里工作吗?
of the U.S. Government?

365
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,736
事实上我就是
As a matter of fact I do.

366
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,340
一个小地方叫车管所
At a little place called the DMV.

367
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,875
他更胜一筹啊
He's got him there.

368
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,479
D甚至都代表了部门这个词
The D even stands for department.

369
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,680
不好意思大家!
Excuse me!

370
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,781
不好意思 我能
Excuse me, can I please

371
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,183
听听大家的意见吗?
see a show of hands?

372
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,819
谁很不爽这个人这里插队?
Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?

373
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,056
看吧
Told you.

374
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,325
好吧 你们的行为让人真心寒!
Well, what a sad state of affairs!

375
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,194
你们全部都被生活打压的够够的
That you've all been so ground down

376
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,830
你们甚至没有注意到有人不尊重你们
by life, you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.

377
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,465
简直不能相信我们要被打
I can't believe we're gonna get beat up,

378
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,035
却不是因为你的凳子
and it's not because of your chair.

379
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,337
你们要知道 现在 在队伍的最后面
You know, right now, at the back of this line,

380
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,006
有一个同你们一样的影迷
there's a movie fan like you

381
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,440
不能入场了
who's not going to get in,

382
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,809
因为这个人不在乎
because this person simply doesn't care.

383
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,277
61年前
Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

384
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,413
也有一个人站在队伍后面
there was another person at the back of the line

385
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,715
她的名字是Rosa Parks
and her name was Rosa Parks.

386
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,715
{\an8}Rosa Parks，美国50-60年代的黑人民权运动引导者。

387
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,021
你可能需要假装你是黑人
Okay, you may have to pretend you're black

388
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,257
来帮助我们离开这里
to get us out of here.

389
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,726
让我们追随这位勇敢女性的脚步
Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps,

390
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,029
为我们自己站出来
and stand up for ourselves!

391
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,531
我知道她是为了能够坐下而站起来抗争
And-and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated,

392
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,867
但现在不是欣赏这个对比的时候
but now is not that time to enjoy the irony of that.

393
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,435
我再问你们
Now, I ask you again.

394
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,604
有没有人反对这个人...?
Who here takes issue with this person...?

395
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,739
我们为什么要听你的? 你自己也插队了
Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.

396
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,042
我几乎绝对没有
I most certainly did not.

397
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,810
我看到你了
I saw you.

398
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,146
如果你觉得头晕
If you're feeling dizzy,

399
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,848
因为风水轮流转
it's because the tables have turned.

400
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,020
抱歉 我付钱让人在这里帮我排队
Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me,

401
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,689
我来的时候
and then when I arrived,

402
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,490
他走 所以你看到的 好女人
he left, so what you saw, my good woman,

403
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,026
是换位不是插队
was "swapsies", not "cutsies".

404
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,361
不 不 不 等等!
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!

405
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,829
我再问一次 举手示意
I ask you all again. A show of hands.

406
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,698
有没有人反对...? 不要走了
Who here takes issue...? Well, stop moving!

407
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,665
他要进去了!
He's gonna get in!

408
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,933
- 让他去  - 我不能
- Buddy, let it go.  - No, I can't.

409
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,068
这是不对的
This isn't right.

410
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,135
你已经尽力了
You did everything you could.

411
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,705
不 我还可以
No, I could've done more.

412
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,207
现在你抹黑了
Now, now, you denigrated the memory

413
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,875
一位伟大的民众权利先锋
of a great civil rights pioneer.

414
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,310
大家都可以提问这个了
That's all anyone could ask.

415
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,350
说实话 我很惊讶你会在意这场婚礼
To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.

416
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,286
我还是人啊 Penny
I'm still human, Penny.

417
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,254
自己儿子的婚礼没有被邀请
Not getting invited to my own son's wedding

418
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,190
很难忽略啊
is difficult to ignore.

419
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,591
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel.

420
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,493
她没邀请任何人
She didn't invite any of us.

421
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,195
那就是一时冲动!
It was spur of the moment!

422
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,064
但我们可以在网上看到现场直播
But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.

423
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,600
我可以在网上看到?
I could've watched it on the Internet?

424
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,804
谢谢你
Thank you.

425
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,641
那如果我们邀请你来维加斯
So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas

426
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,010
观礼 你会来吗?
to see us get married, you would've come?

427
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,980
不会 我会说你们正在犯一个大错
No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake.

428
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,916
但邀请是好的
But an invitation would've been nice.

429
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,687
你真的觉得我们做错了?
You really think we made a mistake?

430
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,322
那会儿我是这么想的
At the time I did.

431
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,691
但我从来没有看到Leonard这么高兴过
But I-I've never seen Leonard so happy,

432
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,460
所以... 也许是我错了
so... perhaps I was wrong.

433
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,562
哇哦
Wow.

434
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,564
好了
Okay.

435
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,466
这样如何?
Well, um, how about this?

436
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,968
趁你在城里
Maybe while you're still in town,

437
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,871
Leonard和我再举办一场小型仪式
Leonard and I could have another small ceremony.

438
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,106
如果你感兴趣的话
You know, if you're interested.

439
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,710
我觉得这是完全可以接受的
I would find that perfectly acceptable.

440
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,612
她觉得
She would find it

441
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,013
是完全可以接受的!
perfectly acceptable!

442
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,215
你们看到了吗? 我们好上了!
You guys saw it! We bonded!

443
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,104
Howie啊?
Howie?

444
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,139
你没事吧? 你在里面有一会儿了
You doing okay? You've been in there a while.

445
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,375
我很好 马上出来
I'm fine. Be right out.

446
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,480
我是一个美国英雄吗?
Am I an American hero?

447
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,884
这是一个好问题 Jim
Well, that's a good question, Jim.

448
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:01,788
你不觉得当一位宇航员离开这个星球
