1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,900

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,800
Leonard, are you in the shower?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,940
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,070
I asked if you were in the shower,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,040
but that's moot now!

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,210
What?

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,050
Moot! Rendered unimportant by recent events!

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,620
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,420
I have to skip the chitchat.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,690
Emergency.

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,560
What kind of emergency?

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,230
You get mathematical-- 32-ounce banana smoothie,

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,260
16-ounce bladder.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,830
You might not want to do that.

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,560
I assure you I do.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,170
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,140
What?!

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,970
Hello, Sheldon.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,440
What are you doing in there?

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,710
She can't be in here!

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,380
We were in here first; you can't be in here.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,050
According to the roommate agreement,

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,550
paragraph nine, subsection B,

24
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,280
"The right to bathroom privacy

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,550
is suspended in the event of force majeure."

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,220
And believe me, I am experiencing

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,160
a very majeure force.

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,660
Come on, you can't wait two minutes?

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,590
Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,740
Penny? Penny? Penny?

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,110
What?

32
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,310
Move. Move. Move!

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

34
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,140
you are officially charged

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,470
with two violations of the roommate agreement.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,740
Do you waive reading of the charges?

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah, fine.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,210
Hang on. No.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,720
My client does not waive reading of the charges.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
Cool. I've got a lawyer.

41
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,570
And I've seen her naked.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,900
Proceed.

43
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,540
Very well.

44
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,010
"Count the first:

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,510
On or about the 28th day of April,

46
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,310
the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,810

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,810
deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency,

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,090
to wit, my back teeth were floating.

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Count the second: the accused exceeded

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,630
the agreed upon occupancy of the shower,

52
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,300
to wit, one, unless we are under attack

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,160
by water-soluble aliens."

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,760
Can I see the roommate agreement?

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,300
Um, it's fairly technical.

56
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,200
I think I can handle it.

57
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,940
Top of her class, Cambridge University.

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,340
Licensed to practice law in three countries

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,110
and your face.

60
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
All right, based on a cursory reading,

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,520
it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,420
Do so, do so.

63
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,260
Oh, I'm afraid not.

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,670
Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,460
in emergency situations, is not specific

66
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,700
as to what constitutes an emergency.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,930
Oh, that's ridiculous!

68
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,240
A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,310
Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair,

70
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,710
could he barge in while you were showering?

71
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,210
Irrelevant. Leonard doesn't trimis nose hair.

72
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,820
He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,750
My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is,

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,200
ambiguity in a contract benefits

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,960
the party that did not draft it,

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,230
in this case, Leonard.

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,630
- So much for count one. - But...

78
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,860
There's no buts, Sheldon; that's how the law works.

79
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,600
Schooled!

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,940
As for the shower capacity issue,

81
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,770
I cite addendum J.

82
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,280
"When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water."

84
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,380
I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.

85
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,450
Superceded!

86
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,060
This isn't over.

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,300
No offense, but shower sex with you

88
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
is now the second best thing that's happened today.

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,200
Mmm, Greek food on pizza night?

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,660
This is the most delightfully cruel thing

91
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,450
we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message

92
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,640
from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,740
Seriously?

94
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,210
I wish to discuss your theories of black holes.

95
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,550
Meet me at the Randy's Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

96
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,860
What is that you're eating?

97
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,630
Tonight is pizza night.

98
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,860
I'd like to refer that to my attorney.

99
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,830
According to what I see here,

100
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,940
Thursday nights are Franconi's pizza night.

101
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,470
Yes, and when Franconi's went out of business,

102
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,540
we switched to Graziano's.

103
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,840
That's interesting.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,610
Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?

105
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,910
A good question, Howard.

106
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,280
Turns out you can't.

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
According to the document you drew up, Sheldon,

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,040
the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires

109
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,020
public hearings and a 60-day comment period.

110
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,060
Were those criteria met?

111
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,700
No.

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,540
Opa! Opa! Opa!

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
This is Greek food?

114
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,140
Leonard, you hate Greek food.

115
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,710
Not as much as you.

116
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,550
Fine. I'm nothing if not adaptable.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,790
I got you the lamb kabob.

118
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,830
Thank you.

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,750
If you think about it,

120
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,520
Greek food isn't that far from Italian food.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,020
They share a spice palette.

122
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,900
And what a civilization is the Greeks'!

123
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,870
They gave us science, democracy,

124
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,780
and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Penny? Penny? Penny?

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,470
Hey. What's up?

127
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,380
The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb.

128
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,650
Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment.

129
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,420
Order one.

130
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,580
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

131
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner.

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
But you're welcome to tag along.

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,790
A girls' night?

134
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,450
Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening

135
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,160
talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,530
Okay, suit yourself.

137
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,070
We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.

138
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,740
Shotgun.

139
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,200
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls' night out.

140
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,610
Fair warning-- we can get ca-razy.

141
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,610
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars

142
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,680
and pretended to be dragons.

143
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,310
Really, Amy?

144
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,780
Tobacco and alcohol?

145
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,920
Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,490
by people having a good time?

147
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,860
Why did you bring him? He's harshing my buzz.

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
I felt sorry for him.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,030
Priya's giving him a hard time.

150
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,540
Ooh, the Priya bashing's starting early. Yay!

151
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,140
Okay, what's up with those pantsuits?

152
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,970
I need some context.

153
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,280
Pantsuits suck.

154
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,710
And that opens her up

155
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,750
to justifiable ridicule for wearing them.

156
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,180
Good one, Bernadette.

157
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,290
See? Ca-razy.

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,270
You smell like baby powder.

159
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,500
It's talc.

160
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,940
But as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder,

161
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,410
I understand your confusion.

162
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,980
Oh, I'm not confused at all.

163
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,180
You're like a sexy toddler.

164
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,020
I don't know how to process that.

165
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,390
I do.

166
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,490
Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree.

167
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,400
K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.

168
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,530
That's too many S's for "kissing."

169
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,800
Not if they're doing it for a long time.

170
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,740
Sheldon... have you ever kissed a girl?

171
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,960
Other than my mother, my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,860
But in the interest of full disclosure,

173
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,330
I was once on a bus

174
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,410
and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun

175
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,750
who passed out from heat exhaustion.

176
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,790
Every year I get a Christmas card from her,

177
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,330
signed with far too many X's and O's.

178
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,200
That doesn't count.

179
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,370
Aren't you even a little curious?

180
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,030
Yeah, you're a scientist--

181
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,240
where is the curiosity?

182
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,810
I'm available for experimentation.

183
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,110
Thank you.

184
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,350
Not necessary.

185
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,610
We know everything there is to know about kissing.

186
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,570
It requires 34 facial muscles

187
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,480
and 112 postural muscles.

188
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,650
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

189
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,720
Give me some sugar, bestie.

190
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm certainly glad no one said

191
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,360
they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.

192
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,230
Hey, I know-- let's take Sheldon dancing.

193
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,470
Ooh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance.

194
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,670
I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.

195
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,910
No, thank you, but for the record,

196
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm an excellent dancer.

197
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,850
Proficient in the Rumba, Waltz and Cha-cha.

198
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,950
Really?

199
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,610
I don't see why that's surprising.

200
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,350
I excel at so many things.

201
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,850
You've had my sourdough bread.

202
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,320
Did you take dance lessons?

203
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,690
Against my will,

204
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,820
in the South, preadolescent children

205
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,260
are forced through a process called cotillion,

206
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,630
which indoctrinates them with all the social graces

207
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,470
and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.

208
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,570
Oh, we are so taking you dancing.

209
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,940
No, you most certainly are not.

210
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,610
Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected

211
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,810
of a gentleman when three ladies ask him

212
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,850
to escort them to a dance soiree?

213
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,190
I saved a nun's life,

214
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,420
Why am I being punished?

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,330
Take us someplace we can waltz.

216
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,570
Where you can what?

217
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,300
Waltz. It's a social dance from Austria

218
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,340
choreographed to a three-four time signature.

219
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,210

220
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,280

221
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,590
Oh, waltz.

222
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,730
Here we go.

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,870
*I kissed a girl and I liked it

224
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,100
*I hope my boyfriend don't mind...

225
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,970
What happened to you?

226
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,190
Shake it baby, shake it!

227
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,090
Muy caliente, Sheldon!

228
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,130
Care to dance?

229
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,970
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

230
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,970
How about you?

231
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,240
Oh, what the hell.

232
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,130
How come if we're the smart people,

233
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,460
we don't do this every night?

234
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,060
What's 16 times 14?

235
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,600
My burps taste like cranberry juice.

236
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,070
And there's your answer.

237
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,970
Would you like to come in for a nightcap?

238
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,810
If you're referring to the beverage,

239
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,350
you know I don't drink.

240
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,850
If you're referring to the hat you don

241
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,150
while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.

242
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,520
I have Yoo-hoo.

243
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,020
It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

244
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,290
The name literally beckons.

245
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,560
Make yourself comfortable.

246
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,800
Thank you.

247
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,200
Is someone smoking?

248
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,140
Oh, that's just Ricky.

249
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
You own a smoking monkey?

250
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,210
Don't be silly. He's one of the animals

251
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,350
in my department's nicotine addiction study.

252
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,850
What's he doing here?

253
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm giving him emphysema.

254
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,320
The least I can do is let him hang out and watch Cable.

255
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,590
Remarkable.

256
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,660
Aren't you worried about secondhand smoke?

257
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,030
A little. The real danger is him biting

258
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,830
my face off while I'm sleeping.

259
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,240
Is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?

260
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,310
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

261
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,210
Thank you.

262
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,020
May I share something with you

263
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,490
that's troubling me?

264
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,490
Of course.

265
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,990
What's rattling around that big bulbous head of yours?

266
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,830
Priya has essentially nullified

267
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,760
my roommate agreement with Leonard,

268
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,530
making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.

269
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,870
And you want me to kill her? Done.

270
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,740
No, of course not.

271
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
I trained Ricky how to smoke.

272
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,210
I can train him to shoot a poison dart.

273
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,540
No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.

274
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,380
I understand

275
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,610
the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is

276
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,680
that makes girls go wild...

277
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,650
but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.

278
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,720
Excuse me.

279
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,360
Have you considered that your intelligence

280
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,630
might be the very thing causing your dilemma?

281
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,600
No.

282
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
What do you think Ricky over here would do

283
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,540
if an interloper encroached on his territory?

284
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,410
Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance

285
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,780
through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display.

286
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,220
That's a little outside my comfort zone.

287
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,720
You're being too literal.

288
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,060
My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules,

289
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,790
and neither should you.

290
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,730
Are you suggesting I play dirty?

291
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,060
Yes, dirty.

292
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,500
Dirty... dirty... dirty.

293
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,500

294
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,770
Which brings me to our next order of business.

295
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,380
Fascinating.

296
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,620
I hope you don't take what I'm about to do

297
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,650
as a comment on what we just did.

298
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,240
Who's to say you shouldn't be dissecting our brains?

299
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,370
You really are an ass.

300
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,310
Morning, Sheldon.

301
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, good, you're up.

302
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,180
I've written a new and improved

303
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,880
roommate agreement that benefits me greatly.

304
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,920
I'd like you to sign it.

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,790
Why would I want to do that?

306
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,560
Excellent question.

307
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,490
Do you remember what happened to the alien,

308
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,260
played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin,

309
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,400
in the Star Trek episode "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

310
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,310
Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence

311
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,540
and threatened to blow up the Enterprise

312
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,780
and kill them both unless he gave in?

313
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,040
Affirmative.

314
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,080
Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

315
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,590
Activate self-destruct sequence.

316
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,190
Code 1-1-A-2-B.

317
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,860
Self-destruct sequence activated.

318
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,900
What are you gonna do, Sheldon,

319
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,300
blow up the apartment?

320
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,740
That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.

321
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,300
So what happens when it counts down?

322
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,540
Unless Leonard signs the new agreement

323
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,610
in the next 41 seconds,

324
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,550
this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India

325
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,780
saying that you're in a secret relationship

326
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,150
with the whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

327
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,820
Leonard Hofstadter.

328
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,660
Oh, my God.

329
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,760
What's the big deal?

330
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
Trust me, it's a big deal.

331
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,430
They're gonna find out about me eventually, right?

332
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,930
Yeah, of course, just not today.

333
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,500
20 seconds.

334
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,660
Are you ashamed of me?

335
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,870
Of course not.

336
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,500
Then why can't we tell your parents?

337
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,840
Please, don't push this.

338
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,100
He does that all the time, doesn't he? 15.

339
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,140
Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.

340
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,210
No, he's bluffing.

341
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,540
- I never bluff. Ten. - It's blackmail!

342
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,610
- Nine. - We give up.

343
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,650
- Eight. - This is ridiculous.

344
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,410
It's a laptop with a full charge.

345
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,950
Honestly, what do you see in him?

346
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,880
Give him what he wants or we're done.

347
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,850
- Three. - Really?

348
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,420
- Two. - Okay, I'll sign it!

349
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,090
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

350
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,260
You may have gone to Cambridge,

351
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,330
but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy.

352
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,050
Good morning, Amy.

353
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,160
It most assuredly is not.

354
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,590
Are you experiencing dehydration, headache,

355
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,760
nausea and shame?

356
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,630
Yes.

357
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,900
I also found a Korean man's business card

358
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,340
tucked into my cleavage.

359
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,600
What happened last night?

360
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,510
Ah, memory impairment;

361
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,110
the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.

362
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,250
Sheldon?

363
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,410
All right.

364
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,980
Last night you gave me some excellent advice

365
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,350
regarding my problem here at home,

366
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,790
you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes,

367
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,590
following which you passed out on your bathroom floor.

368
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,700
I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow,

369
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,630
set your oven clock to the correct time

370
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,800
because it was driving me crazy...

371
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,600
...and I left.

372
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,770
Okay.

373
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,340
Don't really know where we go from here.

374
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,010
I suggest we treat our relationship

375
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,210
as if it were a crashed computer

376
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,780
and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.

377
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,150
Terrific. Thank you.

378
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,200
They were out of menthols!

379
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Get off my back!

380
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,340
Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.

381
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,770
Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!

382
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,880
You're preaching to the choir, sister.
