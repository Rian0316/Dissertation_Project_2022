{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sociologist Lindstrom is remaining behind

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,590
一队专家一起留下来
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}with a party of experts who will help restore

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,070

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}the planet's culture to a human form.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,770
最新的兰德鲁啊  舰长
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The late Landru, Captain.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,920
工程学上的一项伟大成就
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}A marvelous feat of engineering.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,160
一台能指导成千上万
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}A computer capable of directing the lives

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,260
人类生活的电脑系统
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}of millions of human beings.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,140
但它始终是机器啊  史波克先生
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But only a machine, Mr. Spock.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,590
兰德鲁先生倾尽自己所有的知识打造它
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge,

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,940
但却无法将他的智慧  同情
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion,

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,780
理解与灵魂灌注给它
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}his understanding, his soul.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,000
我更喜欢具体的  可理解  可证明的东西
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,010
史波克先生  你一定能当一台很棒的电脑
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You'd make a splendid computer, Mr. Spock.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,900
舰长  谢谢您的夸奖
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That is very kind of you, Captain.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,610
这句的笑点  在史波克是半人半瓦肯人混血
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's humorous, because Spock is half human and half Vulcan.

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,080
但他对自己人性的那方面感到羞耻
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But he's ashamed of his human side.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,490
所以我对他很有认同感
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's why I identify with him.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,830
祝好运
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Good luck.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,980
我更偏向寇克一点
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I gravitate a little more towards Kirk.

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,330
为什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Why?

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,000
因  为...  他所说的每  一  句  话
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Be-cause... everything he says...

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,900
都说得好像很  重  要
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}he makes sound so im-portant.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,330
这样没错啊  他可是舰长
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I should hope so-- he's the captain.

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,480
谢尔顿
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sheldon.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,690
帮我个忙
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Do me a favor.

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,110
去给你哥补习明天的数学考试
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Go help your brother study for his math test tomorrow.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,020
这不算浪费我的宝贵时间吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Is that really a good use of my time?

29
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,920
乖啦  我都好好求你了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Come on. I'm asking nice.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,150
他要是没及格  他就不能打橄榄球
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}If he doesn't pass, he won't be able to play football.

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,500
你知道他常欺负我吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You realize he's often mean to me.

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,250
那又如何  你妈也常欺负我  我还是总帮她啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So? Your mother's mean to me. I still try to be helpful.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,950
她有朝你的脸放屁吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Does she break wind on your head?

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,540
因为小乔治就对我这么做过
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Because that's what Georgie does to me.

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,060
你能帮我劝劝他吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Can you help me out here?

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,080
如果你带我去火车玩具店我就帮你
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'll do it if you take me to the train store.

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,490
没问题
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You got it.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,830
而且我想要什么你都得买给我
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And buy me whatever I want.

39
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,400
康妮  你这是在干嘛
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Connie, what are you doing?

40
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,320

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Don't mock the captain.

43
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,870

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Deal.

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,840

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Why?

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,970
我疼他多过喜欢你
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I guess I like him better than you.

48
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,060
小乔治
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie?

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,700

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What?

50
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,140
爸爸叫我来给你补习数学考试
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Dad told me to help you study for the math test.

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,900

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't need your help. Get lost.

52
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,460

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie, let him help you!

53

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What's your problem?

56
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,200

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,590
我们开始前  我想先了解一下
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Before we start, I'd like to get a sense

60
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,180

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,210
你懂怎么解与绘制线性不等式的图吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Do you understand solving and graphing linear inequalities?

63
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,420
当然
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sure.

64
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,570
很好  你解释一遍给我听
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Great. Explain it to me.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,790
你先解出它们
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}First you solve 'em...

66
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,000
然后你画出它们
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and then you graph 'em.

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,050
那你怎么做这些呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And how do you do that?

68
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,950
你懂的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Uh, you know,

{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}quadrant two is soft and plush...

103
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,710
第三象限闻起来有薰衣草味
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}quadrant three smells like lavender,

104
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,370
第四象限与斐波那契数列重叠在一起
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and quadrant four is overlaid with a Fibonacci spiral.

105
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,040
真是太奇怪了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's really weird.

106
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,770
才没有  真正奇怪的是解简单的代数时
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No. What's really weird is doing simple algebra

107
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,290
脑海里却想着比基尼女郎
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and thinking about a girl in a bikini.

108
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,310
我不同意
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I disagree.

109
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,300
爸爸
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Dad!

110
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,890
继续教
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Keep going.

111
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,000
当除以负数时
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And when you divide by a negative number,

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,650
你得把不等式的两端进行变号
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}you have to reverse the direction of the inequality.

113
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,580
我累了  我要去睡了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

114
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,910
但我们还没学完  你会挂科的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But we're not done. You're going to fail.

115
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,470
我听够多你说的话了  我能行
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I get enough of what you said. I'll be fine.

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,470
就是在那一刻  我决定了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It was at that moment I decided

117
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,540
我并不适合教职
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I was not cut out for teaching.

118
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,560
我用我在其他方面
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I consoled myself with the knowledge

119
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,470
都无人能出其右来安慰了自己
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}that I was wonderful at everything else.

120
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,480
拿一份卷子就往后传
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Take one and pass it back.

121
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,950
拿一份卷子就往后传
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Take one and pass it back.

122
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,760
你们应该知道  这考试占学期总成绩25%
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}As you all know, this test'll count for 25% of your final grade.

123
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
记得写出所有计算过程
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Be sure to show all your work.

124
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,030
如果被哪一题难住了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}If you get stuck on a question,

125
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,110
先往下做  最后再回头想
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}move on and come back to it at the end.

126
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,850
最后这话我应该不用强调了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And I shouldn't have to say this,

127
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,450
但如果有人作弊  我绝对会抓到
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}but if there's any cheating, I will see it.

128
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,680
老师我脑袋后也有长眼睛
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I got eyes in the back of my head.

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
我的眼睛比土豆上的洞眼还多
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I got more eyes than a potato.

130
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,080
英格拉姆女士
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Ms. Ingram?

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,230
怎么了  谢尔顿
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Yeah, Sheldon.

132
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,340
我写完了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm done.

133
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,410
什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What?

134
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,640
我很享受答卷的过程
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I enjoyed it very much.

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,230
如果你还有别份卷子  我愿意要一份
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'll take another if you have one.

136
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,320
没了  我没有别份卷子
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No, I don't have another one.

137
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,600
你先翻开课本往下看吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}J-Just read ahead in the textbook.

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,330
太好啦
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, boy.

139
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,150
看我哥垂死挣扎我也挺难受的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Seeing my brother struggle was difficult for me.

140
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,260
身为他的家教  他的失败
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}As his tutor, I took his failure personally,

141
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,230
感觉就像是我的失败
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}almost as if I had failed.

142
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,310
这挺怪的  因为我早知道他有多笨
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Which was odd, because I knew how dumb he was.

143
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
小乔治  你今天数学考得如何
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie, how'd you do on that math test today?

144
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,210
还挺难的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It was tough.

145
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,210
我也说不准
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't know.

146
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,070
抱歉我没能帮到你什么忙
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm sorry I wasn't more help.

147
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,150
我也是
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Me, too.

148
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,070
没事的  宝贝  你尽力了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's all right, baby, you tried.

149
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,240
是啊  没关系的  宝贝
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Yeah. It's okay, baby.

150
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,620
我不懂到底是哪里出了问题
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't understand what went wrong.

151
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,460
你在怀小乔治的时候
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Is there any chance you drank alcohol

152
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,350
是不是有喝过酒呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}when you were pregnant with Georgie?

153
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,140
没有
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No!

154
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,640
不用这么卫道人士一般
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, don't be so high-and-mighty.

155
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,080
我在怀你的时候就有喝酒啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I drank when I was pregnant with you.

156
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,900
你不也挺好的吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You turned out fine.

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,490
这年头大家都在说"别喝酒  别抽烟"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}These days everybody's like, "Don't drink, don't smoke."

158
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,180
德克萨斯都要变成加利福尼亚了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I swear. Texas is turning into California.

159
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,540
你知道你要是挂科了  我可帮不上你吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You realize there's nothing I can do if you fail.

160
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,550
你得退橄榄球队
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You're off the team.

161
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,600
我知道
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I know.

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,230
我会求求耶稣基督
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus

163
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,120
帮助你这场考试得到好成绩
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}to help you get a good grade on that test.

164
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,640
你应该在他去考试前祈求祂才对吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Shouldn't you have asked him before he took it?

165
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,940
伟大的祂死后都能复生
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The man rose from the dead--

166
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,540
考完试之后再改应该只是小事一桩
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I think he can fix a test after the fact.

167
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,330
你知道当我听到你说这种话时
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You know, I hear you say things like that,

168
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,160
我都会扪心自问我是不是怀了你的时候
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and I wonder if maybe I did have a few too many whiskey sours

169
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,140
喝了太多柠檬威士忌酒
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}when you were in my belly.

170
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,660
没到我的分数  不过还不错
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Not me, but not bad.

171
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,600
我想说"A"级努力
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I would say "A" for effort,

172
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,770
但"F"级分数
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}but... that's an "F."

173
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,960
怎么了  有多烂
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What? How bad is it?

174
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,920
你得到了"B"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You got a "B."

175
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,630
不是吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Are you kidding?

176
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,730
我真不敢相信
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't believe it.

177
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,620
我也是
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Me, neither.

178
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,500
我也是啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Me, neither.

179
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,310
我觉得我得重新评估我的能力
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So, I guess I have to rethink my abilities.

180
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,140
我很显然是个千古名师
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Clearly, I'm a wonderful teacher.

181
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,590
小乔治不是因为你的教导而及格
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie didn't pass because of you.

182
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,060
你这话什么意思
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What do you mean?

183
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,230
他作弊了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He cheated.

184
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,320
他把答案写在他鞋底了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He had the answers written on the bottom of his shoe.

185
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,790
他不会这样的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He wouldn't do that.

186
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,810
在学校考试骗人作弊  其实骗的只是自己
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}When you cheat in school, you only cheat yourself.

187
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,140
你从哪学到的话
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Where'd you get that?

188
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,710
男厕外面的正能量海报上
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}An inspirational poster outside the boys' room.

189
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,010
谢尔顿  我绝对没看错
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I saw what I saw, Sheldon.

190
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,460
如果这是真的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, if this is true,

191
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,170
他得去向老师坦白
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}he needs to turn himself in.

192
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,830
他不可能去  他会被踢出球队
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That'll never happen. He'll get kicked off the team.

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,590
抱歉  恕我无法相信
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm sorry, I can't accept this.

194
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,720
我相信此事一定还有别的解释
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}There must be another explanation.

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,710
如果你不相信我  你就去看他的鞋底
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}If you don't believe me, look at his shoes.

196
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,120
我会去的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I will.

197
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,830
这运动量挺大啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}This is quite a workout.

198
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,870
你个小人
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You dirty bird.

199
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,710
你在我房间里干嘛
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What are you doing in here?

200
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,800
你作弊了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You cheated.

201
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,590
我才没有
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No, I didn't.

202
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,070
我手里就拿着证据
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm holding the evidence.

203
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,740
让我看看
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Let me see that.

204
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,890
我什么都没看到啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't see nothin'.

205
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,100
你这是妨碍司法公正
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's obstruction of justice,

206
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,910
兼肮脏又没卫生
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}as well as disgusting.

207
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,510
别搞事  我考试及格  就能继续打球
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, relax. By passing that test, I get to play football,

208
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,550
你也能去火车玩具店买东西
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and you get to go to the train store.

209
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,790
大家都有好处
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Everybody wins.

210
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,960
那真相呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But what about the truth?

211
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,150
怎么样
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What about it?

212
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,460
真相[理]必叫我们得以自由
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It's supposed to set us free.

213
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,710
这话你哪学的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Who told you that?

214
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,310
《圣经》啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The Bible.

215
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,980
你什么时候信过《圣经》里写的话了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Since when do you care about what's in the Bible?

216
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,560
当那些话能让我驳倒别人的时候
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}When it helps me win an argument.

217
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,540
《圣经》也说"当孝敬父母"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The Bible also says honor thy father and thy mother.

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,540
如果你去跟他们说  你就会让他们伤心
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And if you open your mouth, you're gonna make them sad.

219
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,050
他辩倒了我
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He had me.

220
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,870
这二傻子莫名其妙地辩倒了我
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Somehow, the mullet-headed simpleton had me.

221
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,590
这事没完
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}This isn't over.

222
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,230
是吗  你想怎么样
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

223
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,410
好吧  好像完了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}All right, maybe it's over.

224
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,650
姥姥
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Meemaw?

225
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,270
我猜你已经看过公共卫生部部长关于
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I assume you've read the Surgeon General's report

226
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,750
吸烟有害健康的报告了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}on the dangers of smoking?

227
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,330
我等着他们把报告拍成电影呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm gonna wait till they turn it into a movie.

228
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,990
那是你的新火车吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Is that your new train?

229
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,200
是的  这是我帮小乔治通过数学考试的酬谢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Yes. It's my reward for helping Georgie pass the math test.

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,730
你看上去不是很开心啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You don't seem too happy about it.

231
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,720
我觉得我不配拥有它
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't feel like I earned it.

232
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,160
为什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Why not?

233
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,570
你能帮我保守秘密吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Can you keep a secret?

234
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,940
我这么大年纪了  能记住秘密就不错了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, at my age, the question is can I remember one.

235
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,530
说来听听
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Try me.

236
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,680
小乔治考试作弊了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie cheated on the test.

237
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,120
而且平安无事
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And nothing bad happened.

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,650
他可以继续留在橄榄球队
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He gets to stay on the football team,

239
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,790
爸妈以他为傲
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Mom and Dad are proud of him;

240
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,770
我甚至因为帮他得到一辆小火车
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I even got a train for helping.

241
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,210
所以你有负罪感
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So you're feeling guilty.

242
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,030
正是这样
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Very much so.

243
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,470
可真是个疑难杂症啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, that's a real conundrum.

244
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,460
你是不是有在看我生日送给你的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Have you been reading the Word of the Day calendar

245
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,080
每日一词日历
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I gave you for your birthday?

246
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,210
无可置疑
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Indubitably.

247
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,180
你对此事作何感想
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So what do you think?

248
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,400
我认为你不应该对此深受困扰
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't think you should let it bother you very much.

249
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,590
我是说  这世上肯定有些人
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I mean, there's always gonna be people in this world

250
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,720
会不守规则
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}who are playing fast and loose with the rules.

251
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,830
而你的哥哥就是这种人
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And your brother's one of them.

252
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,050
《星际迷航》的寇克舰长也是
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's how Captain Kirk is on Star Trek.

253
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,890
没错  所以他是这部戏的主角
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, there you go, and he's, like, the main guy on that show.

254
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,500
不  史波克先生才是主角
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No, Mr. Spock is the main guy.

255
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,930
你说得对
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I stand corrected.

256
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,220
不过通常拯救进取号的人都是寇克
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Although Kirk is usually the one who saves the Enterprise.

257
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,640
因为他不会总是死守规矩吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Because he doesn't always follow the rules?

258
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,780
他甚至在学员时期的一次测试中作弊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He even cheated on a test when he was a cadet.

259
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,250
小林丸号测试
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The Kobayashi Maru.

260
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,040
小什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The what?

261
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,170
小林丸
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Kobayashi Maru.

262
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,860
寇克因此成为传奇
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Kirk is a legend because of it.

263
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,900
小林丸
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Ko-Kobayashi Maru.

264
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,190
听起来像是日式铁板烧餐厅里的食物名
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sounds like something you eat at Benihana's.

265
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,560
你有去过那种餐厅吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Have you ever been to one of those?

266
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
店家会让你跟陌生人坐在一起
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}They make you sit with strangers.

267
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,330
真扯
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It's crazy.

268
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,400
你觉得史波克能变成寇克这样的人吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Do you think a Spock could become a Kirk?

269
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,500
以我的经验之谈
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, in my experience,

270
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,890
大多数人活一辈子都是一个
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}most people stay the miserable bastards they are

271
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,130
可怜的混蛋
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}their whole entire life.

272
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,590
但...
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But...

273
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,420
我也见过有人会改变
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I have seen some folks change.

274
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,780
好吧  我要去玩这辆火车了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}All right. Well, I'm gonna go play with this train.

275
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,300
去吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You do that.

276
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,070
小乔治
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie?

277
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,750
走开
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Go away.

278
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,420
我想请你帮个忙
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I need to ask a favor.

279
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,180
什么忙
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What?

280
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,440
秘密  我能进来吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It's private. Can I come in?

281
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,640
进来吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Come on.

282
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,720
你要干嘛
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What do you want?

283
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,890
我发现你和寇克舰长有共同之处
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It occurs to me you have something in common with Captain Kirk.

284
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,260
我俩的发型都很帅吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}We both have cool hair?

285
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,450
为了成功
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}In order to succeed,

286
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,440
你俩都不介意不守规则
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}you both play fast and loose with the rules.

287
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,200
对  我想是的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Yeah, I suppose we do.

288
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,580
你数学考试作弊的时候  你的策略是什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}When you cheated on the math test, what was your strategy?

289
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,610
我猜最重要的部分是
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, I guess the most important part

290
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,590
考试之前不要踩到湿乎乎的东西
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}was not stepping on anything wet before the test.

291
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,400
还有千万不要拿"A"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And not getting an "A."

292
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,070
你为什么不想拿"A"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Why wouldn't you want an "A"?

293
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,510
因为那会引起怀疑
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}'Cause that would raise suspicions.

294
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,740
谁会相信我能拿"A"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Who would believe I got an "A"?

295
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,210
再跟我说说
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Tell me more.

296
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,550
好的  撒谎的时候
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Okay, when you're telling a lie,

297
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,780
加入一些细节是关键
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}it's important to throw in some details.

298
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,240
比如我想去里奇家过夜
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Like, when I was wanted to spend the night at Ricky's house,

299
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,090
妈妈问我他爸妈是否在家
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and Mom asked me if his mom and dad were gonna be home,

300
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,390
我说他们不但在家
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I said, not only are they be gonna be home,

301
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,680
他爸爸还会教我们
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}his dad was gonna teach us

302
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,000
怎么做烟熏火鸡腿
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}how to cook turkey legs in the smoker.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,030
我喜欢火鸡腿  好吃吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I like turkey legs. Were they good?

304
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,560
根本没有什么火鸡腿  你个白痴
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}There weren't any turkey legs, you dope.

305
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,380
他父母在外地呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}His parents were in Branson.

306
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,550
真厉害  我刚才完全相信你的话
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's incredible. I totally believed you.

307
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,070
细节啊细节
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Details.

308
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,860
现在快出去  我得看完这本书
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Now get out of here, I got to finish reading this.

309
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,980
谢谢  小乔治  你真帮了我大忙
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Thank you, Georgie, that was very helpful.

310
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,860
你听见了吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Did you hear that?

311
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,720
什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What?

312
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,310
听起来小乔治和谢尔顿处得挺好
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sounds like Georgie and Sheldon are getting along.

313
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,650
是吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Really?

314
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,000
不可能啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That can't be right.

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,040
我刚听见的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I just heard it.

316
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,450
或许他们俩还有希望能处得来
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Maybe there's hope for those two after all.

317
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,710
或者这是末日的征兆
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Or it's a sign of the apocalypse.

318
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,840
亲爱的  别打扰我看电视
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Honey, I'm-I'm watching this.

319
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,540
今天的体育课
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So you'll have to find someone else

320
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,500
你得找别人帮你按脚踝了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}to hold your ankles in P.E. Today.

321
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,900
抱歉  你说什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'm sorry, what?

322
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,110
我受了重伤  没办法上课了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I've suffered a terrible injury and won't be able to attend.

323
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,310
发生什么事了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What happened?

324
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,060
你自己看
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}See for yourself.

325
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,560
"威尔金斯教练  请批准我的儿子谢尔顿
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}"Dear Coach Wilkins, please excuse my son, Sheldon,

326
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,010
不上体育课
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}From P.E.

327
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,290
他得了睾丸疝气
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He has experienced a testicular hernia,

328
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,080
接下来的六到八周都需要好好休息
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And needs to rest for the next six to eight weeks.

329
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,580
真诚的玛丽·库珀"
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sincerely, Mary Cooper."

330
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,340
睾丸疝气吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Testicular hernia?

331
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,840
这就叫细节
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's called details.

332
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,730
真是可怜
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Ooh, that's rough.

333
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,450
怎么弄的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hmm. How'd it happen?

334
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,970
不好说
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It's hard to say,

335
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,440
但风险因素包括:  提重物  慢性咳嗽
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}but some risk factors include: heavy lifting, a chronic cough

336
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,130
排便时的重复性劳损
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}and repetitive straining during bowel movements.

337
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,620
我也有个这经历
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I've been there.

338
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,340
好吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hmm. All right.

339
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,130
那就...六到八周后见吧
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Guess I'll see you in... six to eight weeks.

340
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,340
我不知道其他超级大反派
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I don't know if other supervillains

341
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,670
是否是从翘体育课开始他们的职业生涯
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}started their careers by getting out of P.E.,

342
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,500
但我是
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}but that's where I began.

343
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,770
有我捏造的疝气来壮胆
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Emboldened by my faux hernia,

344
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,060
我开始把图书馆的书拿出来
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I started taking books out of the library...

345
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,510
而不去盖借阅的章
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}without getting the cards stamped.

346
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,880
那些书你还没登记呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You didn't check out those books.

347
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,340
我知道
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I know.

348
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,590
在你严厉地批判我前
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Before you judge me too harshly,

349
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,980
我想说  我每次都按时还回去
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I always brought them back on time.

350
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,940
我是破坏规矩的人  不是疯子
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I was a rule-breaker, not a lunatic.

351
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,920
但或许我最满意的违规
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}But perhaps my most satisfying transgression

352
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,620
是欺骗我姐姐
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}was duping my sister

353
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,190
放弃电视的控制权
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}into relinquishing control of the TV.

354
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,760
你好
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hello.

355
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,550
你拿那玩意干嘛呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What's that for?

356
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,470
这个吗  我刚在姥姥后院挖钱呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, this? I was just digging for money in Meemaw's backyard.

357
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,120
那里有钱吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}There's money there?

358
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,990
有啊  我已经发现七毛五了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, yes. I already found 75 cents.

359
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,110
你觉得是谁的钱
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Who do you think left it?

360
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,200
如果让我猜
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}If I were to guess,

361
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,020
我觉得是口袋破洞的海盗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I'd say pirates with holes in their pockets.

362
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,080
铲子能借我用用吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Can I use your shovel?

363
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,200
请便
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Be my guest.

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,070
宝贝  我要发大财了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Oh, baby, I'm gonna be rich.

365
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,190
今天我们来学习牛顿爵士
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Today, we're going to learn about Sir Isaac Newton.

366
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,510
你好  老朋友
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hello, old friend.

367
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,800
世界上最伟大的科学家之一
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}...one of the world's greatest scientists...

368
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,920
明天见  韦恩
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}See you tomorrow, Wayne.

369
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,850
祝你愉快  乔治
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You have a good one, George.

370
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,700
你儿子怎么样了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hey, how's your son doing?

371
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,800
小乔治吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Georgie?

372
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,560
不  聪明那个
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}No, the smart one.

373
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,330
他挺好的  怎么了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}He's fine. Why?

374
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,070
他的疝气呢
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What about the hernia?

375
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,180
什么疝气
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}What hernia?

376
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,420
你妻子说他得了啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The one your wife said he had.

377
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
我在军队时也得过
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Happened to me while I was in the Army.

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,580
是在乔治亚州的一间酒吧  试图抱起个胖妹
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I was in a bar in Georgia, tried to lift up this big gal.

379
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,230
我绝对听到我下面有个爆炸声
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Swear I could hear something pop down there.

380
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,740
这张条是谢尔顿给你的吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sheldon gave you this note?

381
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,980
是的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Yeah.

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,460
这不是我写的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I didn't write this.

383
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,850
你确定吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}You sure?

384
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,740
看起来像你的笔迹
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Looks like your handwriting.

385
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,420
还有跟你一样那勾起来的地方
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}It's got that little swoopy thing going on.

386
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,480
不是我写的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I didn't write it.

387
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,290
如果我儿子得疝气  我肯定知道
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And I think I'd know if my son had a hernia.

388
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,370
那就是谢尔顿为了不上体育课  伪造了请假条
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}So what, Sheldon forged a letter to get out of P.E.?

389
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,100
貌似是的
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Looks like it.

390
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,950
真行啊
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}How about that.

391
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,250
别为他感到骄傲
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Don't be proud of him.

392
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,110
我情不自禁
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Can't help it.

393
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,510
第一次他这么像我的亲儿子
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}First time he ever seemed like my kid.

394
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,970
你知道他为什么突然转了性吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Do you have any idea what's gotten into him?

395
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,690
可能知道
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I might.

396
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,980
为什么
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well?

397
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,590
你们有听过
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Have you ever heard of...

398
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,350
大鱼蛋
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Mobokachi Kaboom?

399
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,300
不对
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Wait.

400
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,140
是小钢蛋
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Koshimaki Magoo.

401
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,430
等等  我一定能想出来
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Wait a minute, I'm gonna get this.

402
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,190
"亲爱的质子教授
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}"Dear Professor Proton,

403
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,020
我非常想跟您见面
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I would very much like to meet you,

404
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,640
我的生命就剩三周了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And I only have three weeks to live.

谢尔顿
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Sheldon.

409
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,570
你能解释一下这张请假条吗
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Would you like to explain this note?

410
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,450
说呀
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well?

411
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,680
我只是想更像小乔治一点
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I was trying to be more like Georgie.

412
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,130
这真是个蠢主意
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}That's a dumb idea.

413
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,880
我们都不希望小乔治像他自己
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}We don't want Georgie to be like Georgie.

414
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,680
听我说  我真的感到非常抱歉
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, let me start by saying how very sorry I am.

415
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,830
尽管我解释说
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Despite my explanation

416
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,510
我是为了接纳我内在的寇克人格
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}that I was embracing my inner Kirk,

417
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,470
我妈还是让我去弥补我曾犯下的错
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}my mother had me make amends for all my misdeeds.

418
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,070
先从图书馆开始
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Starting in the library,

419
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,540
我得重新摆放上百本书
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}where I had to reshelve hundreds of books.

420
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,280
老实说  这个简直爽呆了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Well, to be honest, that one was a hoot.

421
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,140
当威尔金斯教练让我攀绳时  赎罪就不好受了
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}The amends got worse when Coach Wilkins made me climb the rope.

422
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,020
由于缺乏上肢力量
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}Lacking any upper body strength,

423
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,570
我像一根熟食店里吊着的香肠一样
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}I hung there like a salami in a deli window.

424
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,420
最后  我还得跟我姥姥道歉
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}And finally, I had to apologize to my meemaw,

425
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,120
无辜成为我姐姐寻宝大计的受害人
{\fn方正综艺_GBK\fs14\b0\3c&H2F2F2F&}who was an unfortunate victim of my sister's treasure hunt.
