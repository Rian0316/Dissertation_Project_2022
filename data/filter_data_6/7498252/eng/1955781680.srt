1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,300
The Enterprise is preparing

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,570
to leave Beta III in star system C-111.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,420
Sociologist Lindstrom
is remaining behind

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,710
with a party of experts
who will help restore

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,210
the planet's culture to a human form.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,710
The Late Landru, Captain.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,580
A marvelous feat of engineering.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,880
A computer capable
of directing the lives

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,450
of millions of human beings.

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,260
But only a machine, Mr. Spock.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,620
The original Landru programmed
it with all his knowledge,

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,010
but he couldn't give it
his wisdom, his compassion,

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,970
his understanding, his soul.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,130
I prefer the concrete, the
graspable, the provable.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,300
You'd make a splendid
computer, Mr. Spock.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,470
That is very kind of you, Captain.

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,600
That's humorous, because Spock
is half human and half Vulcan.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,310
But he's ashamed of his human side.

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,580
That's why I identify with him.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,020
Good luck.

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,980
I gravitate a little more towards Kirk.

22
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,480
Why?

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,550
Be-cause... everything

24
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,180
he says...

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,130
he makes sound so im-portant.

26
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,320
I should hope so... He's the captain.

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,490
Sheldon.

28
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,690
Do me a favor.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,800
Go help your brother study

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,140
for his math test tomorrow.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,300
Is that really a good use of my time?

32
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,010
Come on. I'm asking nice.

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,350
If he doesn't pass, he won't
be able to play football.

34
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,670
You realize he's often mean to me.

35
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,270
So? Your mother's mean to
me. I still try to be helpful.

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,180
Does she break wind on your head?

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,310
Because that's what Georgie does to me.

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,050
Can you help me out here?

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,040
I'll do it if you take
me to the train store.

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,320
You got it.

41
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,160
And buy me whatever I want.

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,490
Connie, what are you doing?

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,450
Just providing my grandson

44
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,670
with financial guidance.

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,510
Don't mock the captain.

46
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,080
If Georgie passes his test,
I'll get you whatever you want...

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,480
Under 20 bucks.

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,490
Deal.

49
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,510
Why?

50
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,620
I guess I like him better than you.

51
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,990
Georgie?

52
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,390
- What?
- Dad told me

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,280
to help you study for the math test.

54
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,990
I don't need your help. Get lost.

55
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,780
Georgie, let him help you!

56
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,230
Fine. Come in!

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,030
Oh, dear.

58
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,230
What's your problem?

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,330
No problem. I'll just...

60
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,560
tidy while we talk.

61
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,830
Help yourself.

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,600
Before we start, I'd like to get a sense

63
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,040
- of how much algebra you know.
- 'Kay.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,420
Do you understand solving and graphing

65
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,350
- linear inequalities?
- Sure.

66
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,960
Great. Explain it to me.

67
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
Uh...

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,760
first you solve 'em...

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,850
and then you graph 'em.

70
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,050
And how do you do that?

71
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,150
Uh, you know,

72
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,560
carefully.

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,860
Excuse me.

74
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,820
$20 isn't gonna do it.

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,410
- Synced and corrected by VitoSilans -
-- www.Addic7ed.com --

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,780
So you collect all
the terms linear in X.

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,110
See? Simple.

78
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,510
Maybe for you.

79
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,440
No, it's simple for everybody.

80
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,580
Now you collect all
the terms linear in Y.

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,040
I don't get it.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,520
Try this. Close your eyes.

83
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,030
- 'Kay.
- Can you see

84
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,460
the slope of the line given
by the coefficients of X and Y?

85
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,330
No.

86
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,000
What do you see?

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Darkness.

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
Try harder.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,140
Wait.

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,710
I see Elle Macpherson in a bikini.

91
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,880
Ooh, it just fell off.

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,980
- Dad!
- I'll make it $40! Keep going!

93
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,850
Maybe the problem is
you're not a good teacher.

94
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,920
Unlikely. Regardless,
I am your only hope.

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,290
What do you see when
you close your eyes?

96
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,620
I see quadrant one as red,

97
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,760
quadrant two is soft and plush...

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,760
quadrant three smells like lavender,

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,100
and quadrant four is overlaid
with a Fibonacci spiral.

100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,400
That's really weird.

101
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,870
No. What's really weird
is doing simple algebra

102
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,070
and thinking about a girl in a bikini.

103
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,570
I disagree.

104
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,640
Dad!

105
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,110
Keep going.

106
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,010
And when you divide
by a negative number,

107
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,450
you have to reverse the
direction of the inequality.

108
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,220
But we're not done.
You're going to fail.

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,510
I get enough of what
you said. I'll be fine.

111
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,830
It was at that moment I decided

112
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,870
I was not cut out for teaching.

113
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,700
I consoled myself with the knowledge

114
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,270
that I was wonderful at everything else.

115
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,690
Take one and pass it back.

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,420
As you all know, this test'll count

117
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,500
for 25% of your final grade.

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,270
Be sure to show all your work.

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,840
If you get stuck on a question,

120
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,960
move on and come back to it at the end.

121
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,660
And I shouldn't have to say this,

122
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,030
but if there's any
cheating, I will see it.

123
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,330
I got eyes in the back of my head.

124
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,160
I got more eyes than a potato.

125
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,870
Ms. Ingram?

126
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,940
- Yeah, Sheldon.
- I'm done.

127
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,210
What?

128
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,570
I enjoyed it very much.

129
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,120
I'll take another if you have one.

130
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,980
No, I don't have another one.

131
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,420
J-Just read ahead in the textbook.

132
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,900
Oh, boy.

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,660
Seeing my brother struggle

134
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,330
was difficult for me.

135
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,990
As his tutor, I took
his failure personally,

136
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,860
almost as if I had failed.

137
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,140
Which was odd, because
I knew how dumb he was.

138
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,800
Georgie, how'd you do
on that math test today?

139
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,940
It was tough.

140
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,140
I don't know.

141
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm sorry I wasn't more help.

142
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,940
Me, too.

143
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,010
That's all right, baby, you tried.

144
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,910
Yeah. It's okay, baby.

145
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,250
I don't understand what went wrong.

146
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Is there any chance you drank alcohol

147
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,020
when you were pregnant with Georgie?

148
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,010
No!

149
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,460
Well, don't be so
high-and-mighty.

150
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,190
I drank when I was pregnant with you.

151
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,660
You turned out fine.

152
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,260
These days everybody's like,
"Don't drink, don't smoke."

153
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,330
I swear. Texas is
turning into California.

154
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,280
You realize there's nothing
I can do if you fail.

155
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,440
You're off the team.

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,500
I know.

157
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,930
Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus

158
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,030
to help you get a good
grade on that test.

159
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,460
Shouldn't you have asked
him before he took it?

160
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,910
The man rose from the dead...
I think he can fix a test

161
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,120
after the fact.

162
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,060
You know, I hear you
say things like that,

163
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,920
and I wonder if maybe I did
have a few too many whiskey sours

164
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
when you were in my belly.

165
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,970
Not me, but not bad.

166
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
I would say "A" for effort,

167
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,470
but... that's an "F."

168
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,580
What? How bad is it?

169
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,240
You got a "B."

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,350
Are you kidding?

171
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't believe it.

172
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,450
Me, neither.

173
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,060
Me, neither.

174
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,340
So, I guess I have to
rethink my abilities.

175
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,710
Clearly, I'm a wonderful teacher.

176
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,680
Georgie didn't pass because of you.

177
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
What do you mean?

178
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,950
He cheated.

179
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,050
He had the answers written
on the bottom of his shoe.

180
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,760
He wouldn't do that.

181
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,330
When you cheat in school,
you only cheat yourself.

182
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,090
Where'd you get that?

183
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,960
An inspirational poster
outside the boys' room.

184
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,100
I saw what I saw, Sheldon.

185
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,330
Well, if this is true,

186
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,250
he needs to turn himself in.

187
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,110
That'll never happen. He'll
get kicked off the team.

188
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm sorry, I can't accept this.

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,910
There must be another explanation.

190
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,890
If you don't believe
me, look at his shoes.

191
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,610
I will.

192
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,700
This is quite a workout.

193
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,030
You dirty bird.

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,390
What are you doing in here?

195
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,560
You cheated.

196
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,050
No, I didn't.

197
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,940
I'm holding the evidence.

198
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,870
Let me see that.

199
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,210
I don't see nothin'.

200
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,970
That's obstruction of justice,

201
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,790
as well as disgusting.

202
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,310
Oh, relax. By passing that
test, I get to play football,

203
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,380
and you get to go to the train store.

204
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,720
Everybody wins.

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,400
But what about the truth?

206
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,730
What about it?

207
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,920
It's supposed to set us free.

208
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,460
Who told you that?

209
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,930
The Bible.

210
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,670
Since when do you care
about what's in the Bible?

211
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,970
When it helps me win an argument.

212
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,190
The Bible also says honor
thy father and thy mother.

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,950
And if you open your mouth,
you're gonna make them sad.

214
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,710
He had me.

215
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,220
Somehow, the mullet-headed
simpleton had me.

216
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,420
This isn't over.

217
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,360
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

218
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,610
All right, maybe it's over.

219
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,180
Meemaw?

220
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,020
I assume you've read the
Surgeon General's report

221
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,750
on the dangers of smoking?

222
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,310
I'm gonna wait till they
turn it into a movie.

223
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,880
Is that your new train?

224
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,910
Yes. It's my reward for helping
Georgie pass the math test.

225
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,180
You don't seem too happy about it.

226
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,420
I don't feel like I earned it.

227
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,050
Why not?

228
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,520
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,590
Well, at my age, the question
is can I remember one.

230
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,890
Try me.

231
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
Georgie cheated on the test.

232
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,400
Oh.

233
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,970
And nothing bad happened.

234
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,430
He gets to stay on the football team,

235
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,810
Mom and Dad are proud of him,

236
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,340
I even got a train for helping.

237
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,130
So you're feeling guilty.

238
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,470
Very much so.

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,010
Well, that's a real conundrum.

240
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,320
Have you been reading the
Word of the Day calendar

241
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,950
I gave you for your birthday?

242
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,550
Indubitably.

243
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,820
So what do you think?

244
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,250
I don't think you should
let it bother you very much.

245
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,540
I mean, there's always
gonna be people in this world

246
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,590
who are playing fast
and loose with the rules.

247
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,500
And your brother's one of them.

248
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,020
That's how Captain Kirk is on Star Trek.

249
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,970
Well, there you go, and he's,
like, the main guy on that show.

250
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,490
No, Mr. Spock is the main guy.

251
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,360
I stand corrected.

252
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,550
Although Kirk is usually the
one who saves the Enterprise.

253
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,920
Because he doesn't
always follow the rules?

254
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,510
He even cheated on a
test when he was a cadet.

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,220
The Kobayashi Maru.

256
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,080
The what?

257
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,120
Kobayashi Maru.

258
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,020
Kirk is a legend because of it.

259
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,190
Ko-Kobayashi Maru.

260
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,890
Sounds like something
you eat at Benihana's.

261
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,330
Have you ever been to one of those?

262
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,700
They make you sit with strangers.

263
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,970
It's crazy.

264
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,970
Do you think a Spock
could become a Kirk?

265
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,280
Well, in my experience,

266
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,710
most people stay the
miserable bastards they are

267
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,050
their whole entire life.

268
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,350
But...

269
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,740
I have seen some folks change.

270
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,520
Hmm.

271
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,260
All right. Well, I'm gonna
go play with this train.

272
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,900
You do that.

273
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,010
Georgie?

274
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,240
- Go away.
- I need to ask a favor.

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,380
What?

276
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,450
It's private. Can I come in?

277
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,230
Come on.

278
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,040
Ugh.

279
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,540
What do you want?

280
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,160
It occurs to me you
have something in common

281
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
with Captain Kirk.

282
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,250
We both have cool hair?

283
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,360
In order to succeed,

284
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,970
you both play fast and
loose with the rules.

285
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,080
Yeah, I suppose we do.

286
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,140
When you cheated on the math
test, what was your strategy?

287
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,540
Well, I guess the most important part

288
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,780
was not stepping on
anything wet before the test.

289
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,850
And not getting an "A."

290
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,780
Why wouldn't you want an "A"?

291
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,280
'Cause that would raise suspicions.

292
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,150
Who would believe I got an "A"?

293
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,650
Wow.

294
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,250
Tell me more.

295
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,490
Okay, when you're telling a lie,

296
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,720
it's important to throw in some details.

297
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,100
Like, when I was wanted to
spend the night at Ricky's house,

298
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,730
and Mom asked me if his mom
and dad were gonna be home,

299
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,800
I said, not only

300
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,340
are they be gonna be home,

301
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,630
his dad was gonna teach us

302
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,930
how to cook turkey legs in the smoker.

303
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,990
I like turkey legs. Were they good?

304
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,110
There weren't any turkey legs, you dope.

305
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,380
His parents were in Branson.

306
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,350
That's incredible. I
totally believed you.

307
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,720
Details.

308
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,430
Now get out of here, I
got to finish reading this.

309
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,860
Thank you, Georgie,
that was very helpful.

310
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,360
Did you hear that?

311
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,440
What?

312
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,050
Sounds like Georgie and
Sheldon are getting along.

313
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,160
Really?

314
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,830
That can't be right.

315
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,960
I just heard it.

316
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,230
Maybe there's hope for
those two after all.

317
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,540
Or it's a sign of the apocalypse.

318
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,170
Honey, I'm-I'm watching this.

319
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,380
So you'll have to find someone else

320
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,330
to hold your ankles in P.E. today.

321
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,830
I'm sorry, what?

322
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,760
I've suffered a terrible injury
and won't be able to attend.

323
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,090
What happened?

324
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,790
See for yourself.

325
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,440
"Dear Coach Wilkins, please
excuse my son, Sheldon,

326
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,790
from P.E.

327
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,000
He has experienced a testicular hernia,

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,830
and needs to rest for the
next six to eight weeks.

329
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,000
Sincerely, Mary Cooper."

330
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,270
Testicular hernia?

331
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,250
That's called details.

332
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,160
Ooh, that's rough.

333
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
Hmm.

334
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,310
How'd it happen?

335
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
It's hard to say,

336
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,220
but some risk factors include:
heavy lifting, a chronic cough

337
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,790
and repetitive straining
during bowel movements.

338
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,430
I've been there.

339
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Hmm. All right.

340
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,630
Guess I'll see you
in... six to eight weeks.

341
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,060
I don't know if other supervillains

342
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,120
started their careers
by getting out of P.E.,

343
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,840
but that's where I began.

344
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,480
Emboldened by my faux hernia,

345
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,130
I started taking books
out of the library...

346
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,180
without getting the cards stamped.

347
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,850
You didn't check out those books.

348
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,290
I know.

349
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,420
Before you judge me too harshly,

350
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,490
I always brought them back on time.

351
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,560
I was a rule-breaker, not a lunatic.

352
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,530
But perhaps my most
satisfying transgression

353
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,430
was duping my sister

354
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,570
into relinquishing control of the TV.

355
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,400
Hello.

356
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,410
What's that for?

357
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,210
Oh, this? I was just digging
for money in Meemaw's backyard.

358
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,010
There's money there?

359
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,610
Oh, yes. I already found 75 cents.

360
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,420
Who do you think left it?

361
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,150
If I were to guess,

362
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,250
I'd say pirates with
holes in their pockets.

363
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,620
Can I use your shovel?

364
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,090
Be my guest.

365
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,430
Oh, baby, I'm gonna be rich.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Today, we're going to learn
about Sir Isaac Newton.

367
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Hello, old friend.

368
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,300
One of the world's
greatest scientists...

369
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,840
See you tomorrow, Wayne.

370
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,610
You have a good one, George.

371
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,310
Hey, how's your son doing?

372
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,580
Georgie?

373
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,550
No, the smart one.

374
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,190
He's fine. Why?

375
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,950
What about the hernia?

376
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,280
What hernia?

377
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,320
The one your wife said he had.

378
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,660
Happened to me while I was in the Army.

379
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,670
I was in a bar in Georgia,
tried to lift up this big gal.

380
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,040
Swear I could hear
something pop down there.

381
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,570
Sheldon gave you this note?

382
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,800
Yeah.

383
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,210
I didn't write this.

384
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,510
You sure?

385
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,810
Looks like your handwriting.

386
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,300
It's got that little
swoopy thing going on.

387
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,310
I didn't write it.

388
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,990
And I think I'd know
if my son had a hernia.

389
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,140
So what, Sheldon forged a
letter to get out of P.E.?

390
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,750
Looks like it.

391
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,420
How about that.

392
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,930
Don't be proud of him.

393
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,060
Can't help it.

394
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,930
First time he ever seemed like my kid.

395
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,220
Do you have any idea

396
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,860
what's gotten into him?

397
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,230
I might.

398
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,830
Well?

399
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,470
Have you ever heard of...

400
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,940
Mobokachi Kaboom?

401
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,150
Wait.

402
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,610
Koshimaki Magoo.

403
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,830
Wait a minute, I'm gonna get this.

404
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,950
"Dear Professor Proton,

405
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,820
I would very much like to meet you,

406
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,390
and I only have three weeks to live.

407
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,230
Please come visit me
here in Medford, Texas.

408
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,960
Sincerely, Sheldon Cooper.

409
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,840
P.S. My Meemaw makes excellent brisket."

410
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,980
Sheldon.

411
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,940
Would you like to explain this note?

412
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,340
Well?

413
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,600
I was trying to be more like Georgie.

414
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,010
That's a dumb idea.

415
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,710
We don't want Georgie
to be like Georgie.

416
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,610
Well, let me start by
saying how very sorry I am.

417
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,760
Despite my explanation

418
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,590
that I was embracing my inner Kirk,

419
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,190
my mother had me make
amends for all my misdeeds.

420
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,960
Starting in the library,

421
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,560
where I had to reshelve
hundreds of books.

422
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,160
Well, to be honest, that one was a hoot.

423
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,770
The amends got worse when Coach
Wilkins made me climb the rope.

424
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,000
Lacking any upper body strength,

425
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,540
I hung there like a
salami in a deli window.

426
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,280
And finally, I had to
apologize to my meemaw,

427
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,400
who was an unfortunate victim
of my sister's treasure hunt.

428
