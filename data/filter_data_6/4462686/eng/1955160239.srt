00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:44,642
Well, that's a sad thought.

363
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:46,385
- [Chuckles]
- Sad but true.

364
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,059
[Sighs]

365
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:51,619
Banking law... needs to be exciting.

366
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,052
It needs the next generation
to come along

367
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:56,587
and give it a big, old kick
in the seat of the pants.

368
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:57,922
Really wake it up.

369
00:22:57,957 --> 00:23:00,325
Let me tell ya how boring<i> I</i> am.

370
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,353
I read FEC and ISO reports
for entertainment.

371
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:07,077
He does. I can attest to that.

372
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,311
Well, I try to stay up on things.

373
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:11,647
The rules are changing all the time.

374
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,330
With everything that's happened
with Enron and WorldCom,

375
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:16,189
the government is extra vigilant.

376
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:19,177
These days, the penalties for
even the most honest of errors

377
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:20,678
can be devastating.

378
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:24,615
You need a sharp,
young eye to catch that stuff.

379
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,086
I mean, when you've specialized
in this kind of work

380
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,773
for decades on end,
you tend to get kinda...

381
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,775
- Stale.
- Stale.

382
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,970
You get stale.

383
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,616
You forget about things like,
oh, I don't know,

384
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:39,202
the Community Reinvestment Act.

385
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:42,734
Any bank such as Mesa Verde
looking to open a<i> de novo</i> branch

386
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:46,493
is definitely going to need
to show a healthy portfolio

387
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:48,072
of CRA compliance.

388
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,408
Duh. [Chuckles] Obviously.

389
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,910
You guys have all that covered,
I'm sure.

390
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:56,336
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking
and Branching Efficiency Act...

391
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,583
there's another mouthful, huh?

392
00:23:58,618 --> 00:23:59,852
Boring!

393
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,225
Still, if you were to run afoul of it,

394
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,264
it could hold you up in court for years.

395
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:09,058
And by the way, uh, if that
<i>were</i> to happen to you folks

396
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,763
as you go forward without us,
which it will not, um,

397
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,691
Howard has contacts at the Fed
who could help sort things out.

398
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:17,282
One or two. Mm-hmm.

399
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:19,251
And then there's
the SEC's interpretation

400
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,250
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

401
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,930
Blah, blah, blah. [Chuckles]

402
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:24,915
Well, navigating that correctly

403
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,814
could mean savings of several
hundred thousand dollars.

404
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,853
They know that, Howard.

405
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:29,822
- Oh.
- [Chuckles]

406
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:30,978
CHUCK: I apologize.

407
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,831
When you reach your golden years,

408
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:34,919
you tend to get a little long-winded,

409
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,954
ramble on and on about details.

410
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:41,582
My point being,
your bank is in excellent hands.

411
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:53,137
Look, I take your point. I do.

412
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,326
But I have to say,

413
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:57,108
I have complete confidence
in Ms. Wexler.

414
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:58,309
You should.

415
00:24:58,361 --> 00:24:59,859
She was part of our team.

416
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,467
She learned from us.

417
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:04,315
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

418
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:07,935
But no matter how talented
one individual may be,

419
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,822
the needs of Mesa Verde
are too big to handle alone.

420
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:13,374
I wouldn't handle
your coming expansion alone.

421
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,656
Which is why you should
consider, once again,

422
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:20,748
enlisting a team of professionals.

423
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:26,170
- Glad we did this.
- Any time.

424
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:28,020
We are there for you day and night.

425
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:29,336
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

426
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,619
And you. Thank you.

427
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,677
Talk soon, gentlemen.

428
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,519
[Indistinct conversations,
elevator bell dings]

429
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,116
Chuck, that...

430
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:43,020
[Chuckles] That was amazing.

431
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,330
You were fantastic.

432
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:46,073
Trul... Whoa. Chuck?

433
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,426
[Winces] Get me home.

434
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:49,827
- Ernie!
- [Groans]

435
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,429
Hang on.

436
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,531
[Groaning]

437
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,367
[Conversations continue]

438
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,953
[Elevator bell dings]

439
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:02,469
Again, we want to thank you

440
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,526
for accommodating the Major like this.

441
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,228
You kidding? It's an honor.

442
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:09,364
For a war hero, I think we can
bend the rules a wee bit.

443
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,216
Well, we really appreciate it.

444
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:14,279
Major Talbott's grandsons are
only in town for one more day,

445
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:17,506
so it's great they get to share
this experience with him.

446
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,725
You guys are in for a real treat.

447
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,009
You excited?!

448
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,844
- Uh-huh.
- Y-yeah, excited.

449
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,646
So, these are your boys?

450
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,413
No, I'm... No, I'm the family attorney.

451
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:30,018
I just help when I can, so I called you.

452
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,422
Well, I am glad to be of service.

453
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,023
And here she is.

454
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:36,692
Gentlemen, meet FIFI,

455
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:40,555
the world's last
air-worthy B-29 Superfortress.

456
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:43,487
She's based in Texas, but she's
here for a quick visit,

457
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,667
just kind of a morale builder
for the airmen.

458
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,597
The crew's on lunch, unfortunately.

459
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,871
Otherwise, I was gonna see about
showing you the inside.

460
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,253
Isn't she a beauty, Fudge?

461
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,985
Just like the one you used to fly.

462
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,385
- Fudge?
- JIMMY: Yep.

463
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,877
Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbott.

464
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,479
His mom used to mail him

465
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,266
care packages of fudge during the war,

466
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,718
and he shared them with his friends.

467
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,269
So that's the story. Right, guys?

468
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:04,974
- Yes.
- Yeah.

469
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,199
Well, sir, this certainly must

470
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,216
bring back some memories for you.

471
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,559
[Mutters indistinctly]

472
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:13,027
"Too many to count," he says.

473
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:15,224
I gotta say, Major Talbott...

474
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,199
it's a privilege.

475
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,168
So thank you for your service.

476
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:24,740
[Muttering indistinctly]

477
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,450
He says, "You're welcome."

478
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:33,977
Uh, um, boy, I envy you guys.

479
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,271
I mean, the stories you must've heard.

480
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,962
You remember any good ones?

481
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,421
- Bombing stuff mostly.
- Bombing stuff.

482
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:41,256
Um, like, um... Like, the war.

483
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,725
Did he fly over the Hump,
or did he take off out of India?

484
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:45,093
[Gasps, coughs]

485
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,979
You doing okay? You need some water?

486
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,913
- [Mutters indistinctly]
- Yes. Yes, sir.

487
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:53,041
Oh, nuts. I forgot his water.

488
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,595
[Coughing] Oh, hey. I can run back
to the office, get him a bottle.

489
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,480
JIMMY: You could?

490
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,274
Fudge, the captain's gonna
run back to his office,

491
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,493
- get you some water, okay, sir?
- [Groans]

492
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,828
All right. That's great.

493
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,658
And there's no rush. He's gonna be fine.

494
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,266
I'll be back ASAP.

495
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,053
Up. Up.

496
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,624
Thought I told you not to say anything.

497
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:19,512
Go stand by the front,
uh, those nose, whatever.

498
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,733
Where the hell'd you find this guy?

499
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,130
You couldn't get a real war hero?

500
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,631
Yeah, like they grow on trees.
So, this guy owes me.

501
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:26,768
I defended him a while back
when he couldn't pay.

502
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:27,686
Defended him for what?

503
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,404
What? You wanna be a lawyer
when you grow up?

504
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:30,608
Just fix the...

505
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,474
Public masturbation.

506
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,758
Total bullshit.

507
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:35,992
All right, keep your voice down.

508
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:37,946
You do not possess the power of speech.

509
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,680
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

510
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:40,532
Chop chop.

511
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,221
All right, hands on hips.

512
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:45,487
All right? Looking strong,
looking proud, all right?

513
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,268
See the bomber, okay? The bomber's
the main point, so see it.

514
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,458
I see the freaking bomber.

515
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,254
Couldn't just plop the dude
in front of a flag?

516
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,106
Why'd we have to come here?

517
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,213
Production value. Showmanship.

518
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,388
You rolling?

519
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,179
- Yeah, rolling.
- Rolling.

520
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,210
Okay, start the dolly.

521
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,320
And action.

522
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,007
You're part of the greatest generation.

523
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,510
You fought the Nazis.

524
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,916
Fought the Japanese.

525
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,752
- What?
- Fought Japanese.

526
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,694
I fought the Japanese.

527
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,636
This machine was used in the Pacific,

528
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:19,571
where the Japanese are.

529
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,928
Why don't you shut up and learn
to take some direction?

530
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:26,077
Japanese.

531
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:27,726
All right, fine.

532
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:31,630
You fought all the dirty... Axis powers.

533
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,835
Your band of brothers came together,

534
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,395
and you saved the world.

535
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,919
You're heroic.

536
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,160
Not that heroic.

537
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,768

00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,711
Couldn't stand
to let Kim have Mesa Verde.

719
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:11,102
You had to swipe it from her.

720
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:12,637
I didn't swipe anything.

721
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,022
We retained our client.

722
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,641
You and Howard never even
heard about Mesa Verde

723
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:20,018
till Kim brought it to ya
on a red velvet pillow.

726
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:28,041
I need a shower, and I've got
a ton of work to do.

727
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,455
So if you're lookin' for a fight, Jimmy,

728
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,886
I just don't have it in me.

732
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:43,815
Thanks for stayin' with me.

733
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,142
I know we have our issues,
but if things were reversed,

734
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:54,866
I...I hope you know that
I would do the same for you.

00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,016
You're doing a great job.

738
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,766
You done this before?

739
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,344
No, not like this,

740
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:31,433
but we learned about fractions
in school.

741
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,935
You did? What fractions?

742
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,143
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.

743
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:41,059
Hmm. Wow.

744
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,714
You know, I gotta tell ya,

745
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:46,064
you are much smarter than I was
when I was your age.

746
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,378
Maybe you needed better teachers.

747
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:51,688
That could be.

748
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:53,735
Can I do the drill now?

749
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,165
- You promised.
- Oh.

750
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,993
I did, didn't I? Huh?

751
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,182
Okay, get up here.

752
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,807
Now, you're gonna have to wear these

753
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:07,642
if you're gonna handle
the heavy machinery.

754
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,305
W-why don't<i> you</i> have to wear them?

755
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,092
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up,
and grown-ups get to be stupid.

756
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,991
Now, put them on.

757
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,444
All right.

758
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,046
Now, I'm gonna hold this
because it's heavy,

759
00:45:21,183 --> 00:45:23,949
but you pull the trigger
when I say so, okay?

760
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:25,653
Now get your hand on it.

761
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,605
All right, you got it?

762
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:28,940
Ready.

763
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:32,888
All right, ready... set... pull.

[Drill whirs]

765
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,449
Good job.

766
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,343
- Can we do more?
- Mm-hmm.

767
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:40,772

00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,436
Wow. What's all this?

772
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,443
KAYLEE: We're making a special hose.

773
00:45:53,468 --> 00:45:56,677
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.

774
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,871
I made marks every 3/4 inch,

775
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:00,888
then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down

776
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:02,746
so he doesn't ruin his table.

777
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:05,777
Then we line up a drill,
put the hole on the "X."

778
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:08,285
Huh. Wow.

779
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,950
I needed a soaker
for the rhododendrons out back.

780
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:15,514
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to
finish his project on his own,

781
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,444
because we have to go.

782
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,405
But we're not done yet.

783
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,158
No, I'll finish up.

784
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,784
But you, young lady, were a big help.

785
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,526

- Thanks, Mike.

Absolutely.

791
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,026
