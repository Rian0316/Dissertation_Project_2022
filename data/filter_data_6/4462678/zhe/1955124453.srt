真不敢相信戴維斯梅因會支持你
I can't believe Davis and Main went for it.

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,170
你真以為我會同意嗎
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?

36
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,310

是我的承諾  是我的判斷
It's my word. It's my judgement.

你一直說"實驗實驗"

我承認我有點操之過急了
I-I admit, I got a little ahead of myself,

00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,190
有點過于激動了

我為此道歉
And for that, I apologize.

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,610
但我認為最重要的是
But the headline here is -- I think --

82
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,640
廣告播出后我們已經接到將近兩百通來電了
we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls since this one airing.

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,210
我沒覺得有問題啊
I don't.

89
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,150
你不跟我們打招呼
You cut us out.

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,790
繞過我們自行其是
You did an end run around us.

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,500

Exuberance is no excuse.

你第一天就跟我說清楚了
Now, you told me that from day one.

95
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,340
吉米  那如果我讓你負責發工資
Jimmy, if I put you in charge of payroll, would that mean

96
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,880
那你給每個人發一百萬獎金我都得同意咯
I'd be okay with you giving everyone a million-dollar bonus?

97
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,750
我倆討論過廣告的可行性啊
You and I did discuss the possibility of a commercial.

98
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,740
理論上的可行性而已
The possibility in the abstract,

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,630

我還以為我聽出了你的熱情
I guess -- I thought I heard enthusiasm,

101
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,170
所以我就稍微自作主張了點
so I-I took some initiative.

102
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,470
"稍微"
"Some."

103

講究的是團隊合作
This is a team approach.

105
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,990
你來之前還是個獨立從業者
You coming to us ‭as a solo practitioner --

106
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,600
我知道你還需要一段時間的學習
I knew there was gonna be a learning curve.

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,220
但如果你就是學不會融入這個團隊
But if you simply can't fit in as part of the team --

108
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,510
我可以融入  我融入了啊
I can fit in. I-I fit in.

我是來幫你們和HHM打贏磯鷂渡的官司的
I am here to help you and HHM win Sandpiper.

110
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,960
所以我才會這么做
That's all this was about.

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,720
我們可沒指望著磯鷂渡過活
Sandpiper's not what keeps the lights on around here.

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,520

We have clients who wouldn't want to be associated

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,450
比任何案子都重要
It's worth far more than any one case.

117
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,800
這樣的行為會損害名譽
Something like this could damage it.

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,130
這么說吧
Suffice it to say,

119
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,520
現在我們幾位都對你沒什么好感
there's not a lot of love for you in the room at the moment.

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,040
不過
However...

122
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,380
我相信要給人第二次機會
I believe in second chances.

123

沒有
No. I didn't.

你不覺得該跟我說一聲嗎
You didn't think I deserved a heads-up?

當時我覺得沒必要
At the time, ‭I didn't think it was necessary.

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,650
屠庫  他喜歡跟他們面對面
Tuco -- he likes to get face-to-face.

166
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,680
他說他想要知道的一切都寫在臉上
Says everything he needs to know is written right here.

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,590
看著他們的眼睛
Looks 'em in the eyes.

168
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,590
死盯著  好像要把他們看穿
Just stares, like he's looking inside of 'em.

169
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,330
我見過他一盯就盯上五分鐘十分鐘
I've seen him go like that 5, 10 minutes.

170
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,860
為什么要那么做
And what does that accomplish?

171
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,760
他把這叫做測謊儀
Calls it his lie detector.

172
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,340
所以這事得持續一整天
That's why these things go all day.

173
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,840
就你倆嗎  沒幫手了嗎
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?

174
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,970
不需要  我們自己能搞定
Don't need it. ‭We can handle our business.

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,630
不過得花好幾個鐘頭
Anyway, it takes hours.

176
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,580
收錢  數錢  測謊
Collect the cash, count it, lie detector.

177
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,200
一次一個  人進來  交易  然后下一個
One at a time -- guy comes in, transacts, then the next.

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,600
完事之后  屠庫上他的車  我上我的
Then, when we're done, Tuco gets in his car, I get in mine.

179
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,250
然后各走各的
Boom. We go our separate ways.

180
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,230
這時候就該你上了
That is where you come in.

181
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,110
當你看到他在收拾了  就開過去
You see him packing up -- wsssh -- drive over.

182
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,750
停在屠庫旁邊的車位
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.

183
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,010
砰  爆頭
Pop. Head shot.

184
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,740
開車走人  很簡單
Roll out. Easy.

185
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,230
40號公路的上匝道就在那邊八個街區外
I-40 onramp is eight blocks up.

186
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,480
別人還沒反應過來  你就已經沒了蹤影
You're in the wind ‭before anyone has time to blink.

187
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,270
更好的是  這些毒販子
And here's the beauty -- all these, um, dealers?

188
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,400
都知道我們在這  所以故事可以這么編
They know we're here, so the story is,

189
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,910
他們其中一個想要殺死屠庫
one of them got ideas, decided to kill Tuco,

190
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,010
從這生意中撈一筆
get a cut of the business.

191
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,020
在販毒集團看來  可能是任何一個人
Could've been any of them, as far as the cartel's concerned.

192
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,940
這些星期二
These Tuesdays of yours --

193
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,880
結束的時候是白天還是晚上
Day or night when you wrap it up?

194
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,970
-白天  -所以就是光天化日
- Day. - ‭So, full daylight.

195
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,130
過往車輛也很多
Plenty of traffic.

196
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,150
我怎樣才能不被看見呢
How exactly do I not get seen?

197
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,070
我的車總會被看見吧
My car, at least.

29
00:09:38,010 --> 00:10:18,130


199
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,700
{\an3}{\pos(374,227)}會出錯的  終將出錯

198
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,700
墨菲定律告訴我  有人會記下車牌的
Murphy's Law tells me somebody's gonna pull a plate.

200
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,160
好吧  那就去車場買輛舊車
Fine. ‭Go to the yard. Buy a beater.

201
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,670
你就待在車里
You're gonna stay in the car.

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,310
沒人會看見你
‭Ain't no one gonna see you.

203
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,130
就算看到你了  那又怎樣
And if they do see you, so what?

204
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,410
這就是你為什么是完美人選
That's why you're perfect.

205
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,610
你很不起眼  沒什么聯系
You're no one. You got no connections.

206
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,600
你就是個幽靈
You're a ghost.

207
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,970
所以我停在他旁邊
So, I pull in next to him --

208
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,670
那得假定有停車的地方
That assumes there's a parking spot.

209
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,200
毒販子都停在他車旁邊
Our guys park next to him.

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,590
來去都是同一個車位
They come and go from the same spot.

211
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,360
最后一個人走了  你就可以上了
Last one takes off, you're open.

212
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,430
要是有人停在我后面  我就被堵了
Someone comes in behind me, I'm blocked.

213
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,380
誰會停在你后面啊
Who's gonna pull in behind you?

214
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,250
來吃玉米卷餅的人
Well, I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

215
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,050
那該怎么辦
What then?

216
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,980
我該怎么離開
What's my exit?

217
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,790
不知道
I don't know.

218
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,440
下車跑路
Get out and run.

219
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,130
我膝蓋不好
Bad knees.

220
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,340
我付錢就是讓你搞定這些細節的
Look, the details -- that's what I'm paying you for.

221
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,380
你要是有更好的計劃  請告訴我
You've got a better plan, go on, tell me.

222
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,610
我洗耳恭聽
I'm all ears.

223
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,380
你確定要這么干嗎
You sure about this?

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
殺死你的同伙
Killing your partner --

225
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,250
干了就沒有回頭路了
that's a bell you don't un-ring.

226
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,420
看到了嗎
See this?

227
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,480
你知道這是怎么弄的嗎
You know how I got this?

228
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,890
九六  九七年的時候  屠庫和我
Back in '96, '97, Tuco and I

229
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,930
和一群河濱縣的飛車黨合作
were working with these bikers out of Riverside County.

230
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,710
他們賣低純度冰毒
They were running ‭this peanut-butter crank --

231
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,910
質量次得很
Real shit, y'know?

232
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,040
但是便宜  我們拿到手很快就賣完了
But cheap, and we could sell it as fast as we got it.

233
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,970
后來屠庫也用上了
Anyway, ‭Tuco develops a taste for it.

234
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,010
這毒品把人變得很壞
And crank does not bring out the best in people.

235
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,250
讓屠庫發瘋
Made Tuco erratic.

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,420
我們的聯絡人是一個叫道格·保爾森的人
Our connect ‭was a guy called Dawg Paulson.

237
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,140
有一天  屠庫和道格見面
One day, ‭Tuco's settling up with Dawg.

238
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,930
決定對他測測謊
He decides ‭to put on his lie detector.

239
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,060
道格說"你要干嘛"
Dawg's like, ‭"What the hell?" You know.

240
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,800
屠庫就一直死盯著他
Tuco just keeps staring at him.

241
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,410
然后他就不說話了
Then he goes real quiet.

242
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,170
"你覺得我是傻逼嗎  道格"
"You think I'm an idiot, Dawg?"

243
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,820
他認為道格在給他的競爭對手供貨
He thinks Dawg is supplying his competitor,

244
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,160
想要把屠庫取代
trying to cut Tuco out.

245
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,550
道格矢口否認
Dawg -- he denies it.

246
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,030
"不可能  不是我"
"No way! Not me!"

247
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,590
屠庫都沒有提高嗓門  但突然間
Tuco doesn't even ‭raise his voice, but suddenly,

248
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,370
他掏出削短霰彈槍
he's got a sawed-off and...

249
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,710
一槍崩了道格的臉
right in Dawg's face.

250
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,000
我就站在他身后
I was behind him.

251
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,760
那是我至今為止見過最惡心的畫面
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.

252
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,150
而這
And this?

253
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,780
是道格的頭骨碎片
A piece of Dawg's skull --

254
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,660
一小塊鉆到皮膚下面去了
Under the skin, a little piece of him.

255
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,320
我試過挖出來  但它就是不肯出來
I tried digging it out, but it's in there pretty good.

256
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,740
這事可不能去找醫生
Anyway, not the kinda thing you go to the doctor's for.

257
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,970
其實我想說  屠庫很喜歡道格
The thing about it was, Tuco really liked dawg.

258
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,650
后來他也有點后悔
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

259
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,250
但當他吸了毒  就瘋了
But when he's using, loco, crazy.

260
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,720
根本無法形容
There's no other way to put it.

261
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,940
現在他又開始吸毒了
And he's using again.

262
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,010
純度更高的  勁兒更大
Crystal -- much bigger kick.

263
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,870
所以跟你說的一樣
So... It's like you said.

264
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,390
如果屠庫發現了我在外面的私活兒
If Tuco finds out about my, y'know, independent ventures,

265
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,220
我就會落得跟道格一樣的下場
it's gonna be Dawg all over again.

266
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,050
有我沒他
It's him or me.

267
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,740
那里
There.

268
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,760
用裝了瞄準器的槍就可以擊中
A man with a scoped rifle could get a clean shot.

269
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,430
就一發子彈
Fire a single round,

270
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,880
在大家反應過來之前消失
disappear before anybody knew what had happened.

271
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,540
沒有目擊者  還可以順利逃脫
No witnesses. Clean egress.

272
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,580
很遠啊
Pretty far.

273
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
你打得中嗎
You can make that shot?

274
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,690
打得中
Yeah.

275
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,070
你同意干了嗎
You saying you'll do it?

276
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,680
五萬
50 grand?

277
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
那就五萬
50 grand.

278
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,000
我去看看
I'll look into it.

279
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,510
你哥哥不在這  麥吉爾先生
Your brother isn't here, Mr. Mcgill.

280
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,190
我知道
I know.

281
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,880
他讓我來拿他的吸墨紙
Uh, he sent me to get his ink blotter.

282
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,010
-就一會  -小心點
- I'll just be a second. - ‭Watch yourself.

283
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,140
地很滑
The floor's slick.

284
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,910
多謝  杰蘇阿爾多
Oh, thank you, Gesualdo.

285
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,360
抱歉踩臟了
Sorry about the floor!

286
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,640
不是吧
Oh, no.

287
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,540
你在找韋克斯勒小姐嗎
Are you looking for Ms. Wexler?

288
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,050
沒趕上  是吧
I guess I'm too late, huh?

289
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,450
不  她還沒走
No, she's still here.

290
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,650
在哪
Where?

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,760
金
Kim.

292
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,450
我非常  非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry.

293
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,560
我昨晚就應該告訴你的
I should have told you last night.

294
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
是嗎
You think?

295
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,040
我真以為我能解決的
I honestly thought I could fix it.

296
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,790
我以為他們一看到數字就懂了
I thought they'd understand once they saw the numbers.

297
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,930
我知道廣告會有用  也確實如此
I knew it would work, and it did.

298
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,350
真的有效
It worked.

299
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,540
霍華德不能因為我做的事
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

300
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,970
就把你弄來復審文件
because of something I did.

301
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,750
而且我倆在兩家不同的律所
Plus, at an ‭entirely different law firm.

302
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,040
完全沒有道理啊
What the hell kind of sense does that make?!

303
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
我告訴過你后果
I told you this would happen.

304
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,980
他不能因為這事怪你
He can't blame you for this.

305
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,430
我警告過你他會的
I warned you he would.

306
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,760
我要去找霍華德
I'm talking to Howard.

307
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,190
干什么  再罵他是卑鄙無恥的豬嗎
What? And call him a pig fucker again?

308
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,820
是啊  會有用的
Yeah, that'll help.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,220
我搞砸了
I screwed up, you know?

310
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,350
我知道
I know that.

311
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,040
但這...  這完全是扯淡
But this -- this is total B.S.!

312
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,700
我今晚就去找他談
I'm -- ‭I'm talking to him tonight!

313
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,990
吉米別去  你只會弄得更糟
Jimmy, no. ‭You'd only make things worse.

314
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,940
-我會向他解釋  -不用
- I'll explain it to him. - ‭No!

315
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,060
我不是請求你  而是告訴你
I'm not asking you -- I'm telling you.

316
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,400
如果你去找霍華德  你和我就沒戲了
If you go to Howard, you and I -- we're done.

317
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,590
那我們現在還有戲嗎
So, we're not done now?

318
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,430
我需要這份工作
I need this job.

319
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,240
每周開票限額要四十個小時才能審完
And there's a weekly billing quota that I'm about 40 hours behind on,

320
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,690
所以可以請你離開嗎
so could you please just go?

321
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,390
對不起
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,990
查克
Chuck!

323
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,880
查克
Chuck!

324
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,530
快開門
Come on!

325
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,980
我不會走的
I'm not going away!

326
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,200
好  你自找的
All right, you asked for it!

327
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,870
我進來了
I'm comin' in!

328
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,350
查克
Chuck?

329
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,160
查克
Chuck?

330
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,070
能聽見我說話嗎
Can you hear me?

331
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,400
能說話嗎
Can you talk to me?

332
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,980
要我送你去醫院嗎
Do you want me ‭to get you to the hospital?

333
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,680
不  不去醫院
No. No hospitals.

334
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,680
我會好的
I'll -- I'll be all right.

335
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,580
請給我點水
Get some water, please.

336
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,750
給你額外的保護
Extra protection here.

337
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,930
給  這樣
Here. You know what?

338
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,890
坐起來
Sit up.

339
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,440
你能坐起來嗎
Can you sit?

340
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,960
好的
All right.

341
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,280
好了
Okay. All right.

342
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,320
拿著
Here.

343
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,960
這是阿瑪利特AR-50狙擊步槍
That's the Armalite AR-50 --

344
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,440
制造技術先進  射程精確到兩千四百米
State of the art, ‭accurate to 2,400 meters.

345
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,520
裝備了里奧波特Mark4瞄準鏡
I got the Leupold mark 4 on it now,

346
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,210
但我可以幫你升級到施密特本德的
but I can always upgrade you to a Schmidt & Bender.

347
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,890
手動單發
Single shot, bolt.

348
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,630
簡單  有效  值得信賴
Simple, effective, reliable.

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,290
用的是0.50直徑的子彈
It fires the .50-caliber BMG --

350
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,710
對輕型掩體內的軟目標很有效
Very effective against soft targets in light cover --

351
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,650
可以射穿汽車  小樹等等
behind cars, ‭small-diameter trees, and such.

352
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,750
與往常一樣  我已經特意
As always, I've gone to the trouble

353
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,800
磨掉了序列號
of grinding down the serial number.

354
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,330
除非你徹底磨個洞
Well, unless you ‭ground a hole clean through,

355
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,920
否則用酸都可以復原
acid will recover it.

356
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,220
說得沒錯
Well, that would be true,

357
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,390
但我又用隨機點刻壓力機做了處理
but I follow up with a pass through ‭a random-stipple machine press.

358
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,940
把它藏在金屬密度中
Hides the patterns in the metal density.

359
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,220
應該可以逃過X射線衍射
Should throw off your X-ray diffraction

360
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,440
還有其他高科技手段的檢測
and some other higher-end methods.

361
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,460
當然萬事無完美  但這槍接近完美了
Nothing's perfect, of course, but this is close.

362
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,970
就像疝氣上多了個瞄準鏡
Looks like a hernia with a scope on it.

363
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,810
三十四磅
34 pounds,

364
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,940
不包括你的槍架  那也會增加重量
not including your bipod, which adds some heft.

365
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,850
太重了
Too much gun.

366
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,600
我同意  對于大多數場合確實重
For most applications, I would tend to agree.

367
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,170
SR-25比賽步槍  尤金·斯通勒設計  半自動
SR-25 match rifle -- Eugene Stoner design, semi-auto.

368
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,360
大概十一磅
That's about 11 pounds there.

369
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,880
沒有AR-50的射程和穿透力
Not quite the range or the punch of the AR-50,

370
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,080
但射程就算有一千米
but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.

371
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,090
射擊精度也高達0.5MOA
at well past 1,000 meters.

372
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,730
我聽說容易卡殼
I've heard they're prone to jam.

373
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,550
確實在實戰中會發生
Well, it's been known to happen in the field,

374
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,460
但沒有一把半自動步槍可以自吹不卡殼的
but there's not a semi-auto built can boast it never jams.

375
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,700
如果你有所顧慮  你應該選擇手動式的
If that's a concern, you ought to stick to bolts.

376
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,700
好的手動步槍如果都能卡殼
Good bolt-action rifle -- if you jammed it,

377
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,060
那我打賭你肯定是故意的
I'd wager ‭you were setting out to do so.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,380
我們來看看這把M40
Which brings us to the M40 --

379
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,980
十分可靠  經過戰斗檢驗
Tried and true, battle-tested.

380
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,560
自從1966年
Essentially, the same rifle

381
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,850
海軍陸戰隊狙擊手就用這種槍了
used by marine snipers since 1966.

382
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,610
輕便精準  適合在八百到一千二百米之內
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets

383
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,730
射擊軟目標
in the 800- to 1,2000-meter range.

384
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,180
看起來你了解這把槍
You seem to know this one.

385
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,300
那當然
Oh, yeah.

386
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,400
可以這么說
You could say that.

387
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,360
那是A1型
That's the A1 model.

388
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,550
在原版基礎上變化不大
There's not much change from the original.

389
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,090
最大的不同在于槍托
Biggest difference is the stock --

390
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,240
不是木制的  改成玻璃纖維了
it's fiberglass instead of wood.

391
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,830
1970年左右改的
It changed it over in 1970 or so.

392
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,890
好的  木頭太容易變形
Good. Wood warped like hell.

393
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,330
要是受了潮  又被曝曬  就完了
You get it wet, ‭you put it in the sun -- gone.

394
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,860
這槍被帶到叢林里使用之前
Somebody probably ‭should've figured that out

395
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,440
那些人真該想到這點
before they sent it into a damn jungle.

396
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,260
是啊  也許吧
Yeah. Probably.

397
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,440
如果這些都不喜歡
If these aren't to your liking,

398
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,450
我可以再弄幾支來
I could get my hands on a few more.

399
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,540
不用了
No.

400
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,140
我改主意了
I've changed my mind.

401
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,920
謝謝
Thank you.

402
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,960
這次我不需要槍
I don't need anything at this time.

403
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,100
麻煩你了
For your trouble.

404
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,490
不客氣
Oh, it's no trouble.

405
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,050
我做的都是回頭生意
I make my living on repeat business.

406
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,200
等你有需要  就來找我
When you need what I'm offering, you know how to find me.

407
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,330
你還在這啊
You're still here.

408
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,900
是的  我還在
Yeah, I'm still here.

409
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,010
你睡覺了嗎
Did you get any sleep?

410
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,700
睡了一會
Some.

411
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,150
足夠了
Enough.

412
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,350
你感覺怎么樣
‭How you feeling?

413
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,230
我想喝點茶
I could use some tea.

414
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,910
謝謝
Thanks.

415
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,750
你昨晚嚇到我了
‭You scared me last night.

416
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,200
是啊  有時候會這樣
Yeah. Happens sometimes.

417
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,260
有時候是我太過火了  僅此而已
Sometimes, I overdo it -- that's all.

418
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,810
都會好的
It passes.

419
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,900
去辦公室把你累得筋疲力竭吧
Going into the office really takes it out of you, doesn't it?

420
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,870
如果待的太久  是很累
If I stay too long, yeah.

421
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,570
大概是走不開吧
Guess it's hard not to stay.

422
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,250
畢竟有那么多重要的事要你來做
There's so many important things for you to do there --

423
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,680
比如懲罰金·韋克斯勒
like, you know, stick it to Kim Wexler.

424
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,820
我對金·韋克斯勒做什么了
What did I do to Kim Wexler?

425
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,460
她又回"玉米地"了  不是嗎
She's back in the cornfield, isn't she?

426
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,370
我什么都沒對金做
I didn't do anything to Kim.

427
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,610
我當時確實在場
I mean, I was present, yes.

428
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,140
但是人事管理的決策都是霍華德做的
But management of personnel -- those decisions are all Howard's.

429
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,370
可笑
That is rich.

430
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,160
那你告訴我
But tell me,

431
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,530
霍華德做"管理決策"的時候
when Howard was makin' his "management decisions,"

433
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,370
{\an3}{\pos(374,227)}把霍華德比作戴在手上的布偶

432
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,730
是坐在你膝蓋上  你把手伸進他屁眼了嗎
was he sitting on your knee with your arm up his ass?

434
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,370
你喝水的時候他是不是都說不出話
Hey, can he talk while you drink a glass of water?

435
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,970
你這樣說沒有道理
That's uncalled-for.

436
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,610
如果霍華德是我的布偶
And if howard were my puppet,

437
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,540
他才不會推薦你去戴維斯梅因律所
he certainly wouldn't have recommended you to Davis & Main.

438
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,300
實際上  我確定是金·韋克斯勒
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler

439
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,040
說服他這樣做的  所以他才生氣
who talked him into doing that. Hence his anger.

440
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,700
別懲罰金
Don't punish Kim.

441
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,130
如果你生我的氣  那就沖我來
If you're mad at me, take it out on me.

442
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,880
你覺得整個世界都圍著你轉  吉米
I know you like to think the world revolves around you, Jimmy,

443
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,910
但這和你無關
but this has nothing to do with you.

444
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,110
金對哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所負責
Kim had a responsibility to Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

445
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,530
她本該為自己律所的利益著想
She should have been looking out for her firm's interests.

446
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,220
沒告訴我們你要干什么是她的錯
Not letting us know what you were up to was her mistake.

447
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,040
拜托
Oh, come on.

448
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,360
你不能為這事生她的氣
You can't be pissed off at her about this.

449
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,700
我沒生氣
I'm not.

450
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,960
霍華德才生氣
Howard is.

451
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
他憑什么不生氣呢
And why shouldn't he be?

452
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,100
因為她不知道
Because she didn't know.

453
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,190
她不知道我會播出廣告
She didn't know I was gonna air the commercial.

454
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,950
也不知道我還沒得到許可
She didn't know ‭i hadn't gotten it approved.

455
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,820
她不知道
She just -- she didn't know.

456
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,030
-我懂了  -所以她不知道
- I see. - So, she didn't know

457
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,100
她應該事先通知霍華德什么
there was anything that she was supposed to tell Howard.

458
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,880
她以為克利福德已經知情了
As far as she was concerned, Cliff Main was already looped in.

459
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,200
你跟她說他知道了
You told her he was?

460
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,290
我是這么暗示的
I implied it.

461
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,280
所以錯在我  不在她
So it's on me, not her.

462
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,970
她沒跟我們說這些啊
She didn't say anything to us about that.

463
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,120
她不會說的
Well, she wouldn't.

464
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,820
她不想讓我看起來很蠢
Sh-she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

465
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,240
你不能否認  這說明她缺乏判斷
You have to admit this shows a lack of judgment on her part.

466
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,200
她了解你
She knows you.

467
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,380
她應該采取正確的做法的
She should have known better.

468
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,290
你真是個混蛋
You are such an asshole.

469
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,100
我怎么了
Why?

470
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,790
我不就是指出  她信任你是個錯誤嗎
For pointing out that her one mistake was believing in you?

471
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,670
天啊  能不能正確看待這件事
For Christ's sake, can we get some perspective here?

472
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,450
這只是個小廣告
It was a simple, little commercial.

473
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,320
只播出了一次  僅此而已
It aired once -- that's all.

474
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,860
要不要我提醒你  它非常有效
And can I remind you -- it worked.

475
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,660
效果驚人得好
It worked like a dream.

476
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,050
看到你的問題了吧  吉米
See, that's your problem, Jimmy --

477
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,840
你認為只要結果好  手段都不重要
thinking the ends justify the means.

478
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,790
壞事了以后你又總是覺得震驚
And you're forever shocked when it all blows up in your face.

479
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,800
我犯了什么不得了的大錯
What did I do that was so wrong?

480
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,220
你壞了規矩
you broke the rules.

481
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,690
你讓金變成了你的從犯
‭You turned Kim into your accessory.

482
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,130
你讓霍華德難堪  可憐的人啊
You embarrassed Howard, who -- god help him --

483
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,790
他居然莫名其妙地在克利福德面前為你擔保
inexplicably vouched for you with Cliff Main!

484
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,900
克利福德和他的合伙人被你弄得像蠢貨
You made Cliff and his partners look like schmucks!

485
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,250
還要我繼續說嗎
Shall I go on?!

486
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,450
我簡直搞不懂他為什么沒炒了你
How he hasn't fired you for this positively mystifies me.

487
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,710
還"正確看待"
"Perspective."

488
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,850
你要正確地看待嗎
You want perspective?

489
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,140
那我給你說
I'll give you mine --

490
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,250
你是我弟弟  我很愛你
you're my brother and I love you,

491
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,180
但是你就像個酒鬼
but you're like an alcoholic

492
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,710
拒絕承認自己有毛病
who refuses to admit he's got a problem.

493
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,160
現在有人給了你校車的鑰匙
Now someone's given you the keys to the school bus,

494
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,490
我才不會讓你把它開下懸崖
and I'm not gonna let you drive it off a cliff!

495
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,220
我們能直接說要點嗎
Now, can we just get down to brass tacks here?

496
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,410
我要做什么才能讓金回到她的崗位
What can I do to put Kim back where she belongs, huh?

497
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,860
你希望我退出戴維斯梅因律所嗎
What -- you want me to quit Davis & Main?

498
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,650
那好
That's fine.

499
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,790
我當初就沒想要那份工作
I-I never wanted that job in the first place.

500
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,020
跟你說不清楚
I can't get through to you.

501
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,440
生活不是《做交易》的那種游戲
Life is not one big game of "Let's Make a Deal"!

503
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,690
{\an3}{\pos(374,227)}一檔游戲節目  蒙蒂·霍爾曾擔任主持人

502
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,690
就是  我是蒙蒂·霍爾
Yes, it is! ‭I'm Monty Hall!

504
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,100
二號門后面是什么
What's behind door number two?

505
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,740
有什么代價
What'll it take, huh?!

506
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,000
你想讓我退出律師行業嗎
You want me to quit being a lawyer?

507
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,310
像猩猩拿著一把機關槍
Ju-- a chimp with a machine gun --

508
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,470
說的是我  對吧
That's me, right, huh?!

509
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,810
你覺得呢
So, what do you say?

510
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,060
你幫金  我不當律師了
You help Kim -- I quit the law.

511
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,330
-成交嗎  -我沒那么說
- Is that a deal? - ‭I didn't say that.

512
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,440
你嘴上沒說  但心里卻這么想  是吧
No, you didn't say it, but that's what you want, right?!

513
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,660
所以你當初才強迫她
That's why you put the screws to Kim in the first place --

514
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,640
為了逼我
to squeeze me!

515
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,210
我沒那么說  我也不會那么說
I didn't say that, ‭and I would never say that!

516
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,220
為什么
Why not?!

517
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,030
因為如果我阻礙我一個雇員的職業道路
Because if I were impeding the career of one of my employees

518
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,950
是為了逼你做你不愿意做的事
for the purpose of compelling you to do something against your will,

519
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,520
那就是敲詐
that would be extortion.

520
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,300
沒錯
Yeah. ‭

521
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,390
就是  那么
It would. So?

522
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,690
你要敲詐我嗎  查克
You gonna extort me, Chuck?

523
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,830
那你肯定能輕而易舉脫罪
It's a lead-pipe cinch you'd get away with it.

524
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,500
我不會告訴任何人
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

525
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,160
很簡單  只要恢復金的職位
It's real easy -- you just set things right for Kim.

526
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,200
讓她回原來的辦公室  不再復審文件
You get her back in her office, out of doc review --

527
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,360
一切回歸原樣  我永遠不當律師了
Everything back to normal, and I quit the law for good.

528
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,890
不再有吉米·麥吉爾先生  沒了
No more Jimmy McGill, esquire -- poof!

529
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,560
就像沒存在過
Like he never even existed.

530
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,820
但我得聽你親口說出來  行嗎
But I need to hear the words come out of your mouth, okay?

531
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,740
你言而有信
‭You're a man of your word.

532
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,400
你是誠實的人  對吧
You're an upstanding man, right?

533
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,640
-天啊  吉米  -快說  查克
- For god's sake, Jimmy. ‭- Come on, chuck!

534
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,510
敲詐我
Extort me!

535
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,710
說"別干"  我就不干了
Say "quit," and I will quit,

536
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,450
但我得聽你親口說
but I need to hear it from your mouth!

537
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,100
你想讓我犯下重罪嗎
You want me to commit a felony...

538
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,180
這才是你的目的  對吧
Because that's what you'd do, right?

539
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,180
因為你想要相信  我其實是個偽君子
Because you want to believe that deep down, I'm some hypocrite!

540
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,610
很快就知道了
Let's find out.

541
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,920
來吧  查克
Come on down, Chuck!

542
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,900
跟我一起在地上打滾吧
Roll around in the dirt with me!

543
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,240
你會實現所有的夢想
All your dreams will come true!

544
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,730
來  快  快說
Go on! Do it! Go on!

545
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,100
我不是壞人
I am not the bad guy here.

546
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,220
你不想當律師
You don't want to be a lawyer --

547
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,000
那是你和新墨西哥州律師界的事
that's between you ‭and the New Mexico State bar.

548
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,690
你想離開戴維斯梅因律所  隨便你
You want to quit Davis & Main? Be my guest!

549
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,180
你想自毀前途顯然不需要我的幫助
You clearly don't need any help from me to tank your career.

550
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,950
你自己犯的事足矣
You're doing just fine on your own.

551
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,700
說到自毀前途  去圣達菲要一小時車程
Speaking of which, it's an hour's drive to Santa Fe.

552
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,660
就算你現在走
Even if you leave right now,

553
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,660
上班還得遲到至少二十分鐘
you're still gonna be at least 20 minutes late for work --

554
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,020
克利福德·梅因對你的印象會雪上加霜
another feather in your cap with Clifford Main.

555
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,050
怎么樣
So?

556
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,310
我不干了
I'm not gonna do it.

557
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,070
怎么  你想談判嗎
What -- ‭are you negotiating now?

558
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,580
錢再多這也還是個餿主意  對你來說
No amount of money makes this a good idea -- for you.

559
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,590
聽著  伙計  我說了我沒...
Look, man, ‭I told you that I'm not --

560
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,480
這樣不好  因為解決不了你的實際問題
No, it's a bad move because it doesn't solve your real problem.

561
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,040
實際問題是什么
My real problem? What's that?

562
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,770
不是屠庫
It's not Tuco.

563
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,680
而是保密
It's keeping a secret.

564
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,640
屠庫的死會把塞拉曼加的人像蒼蠅一樣引來
A dead Tuco ‭draws Salamancas like flies.

565
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,290
販毒集團會打探此事
The cartel noses into the business,

566
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,960
尋找殺害同伙的人
looks for who hit one of theirs.

567
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,500
你那時還能保密嗎
You gonna be able to keep your secrets then?

568
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,180
總要付出代價
Something's got to give.

569
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,260
有沒有你  都無所謂
With you, without you -- I don't care.

570
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,980
總會發生的
But something's gonna happen.

571
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,940
你自己也說了
You said it yourself.

572
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,180
你不需要他死  你需要他離開
You don't need him dead -- you need him to go away.

573
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,620
你是說告密嗎
You mean snitch?

574
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,840
我打了屠庫的小報告
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco,

575
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,520
你覺得集團會懷疑誰
who do you think the cartel looks at?

576
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,270
我
Me.

577
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,900
如果報警  我也會被抓
And if I call the cops, I get picked up, too.

578
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,350
我就成了已知關聯人
I'm what you call a known associate.

579
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,200
他們把我跟屠庫關在一起
So I'm locked up with Tuco,

580
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,000
而他正在找讓他被關起來的人
who's looking for the guy that put him there.

581
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
告訴我那樣怎么能幫我
Tell me how that helps me.

582
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,340
你不用跟警察說
You won't have to talk to the cops.

583
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,810
任何時候都不用
You won't have to do any time.

584
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
不會死人  但屠庫的問題
There's no killing, but your Tuco problem?

585
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,010
會解決的
It goes away.

586
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,750
都在這兒了
It's all there.

587
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,270
讓他點點
Let the man count.

588
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,250
沒問題
We're good.

589
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,920
那...下次再見
So, uh... till next time, huh?

590
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,900
屠庫
Tuco.

591
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,790
行
Okay.

592
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,820
走
Go.

593
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,920
行
Okay.

594
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,600
下周再見  屠庫
I'll, uh... ‭I'll see you next week, Tuco.

595
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
納喬
Nacho.

596
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,240
再見  多明戈
Yeah, see you, Domingo.

597
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,900
他給錢還挺多
He's got good numbers.

598
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,950
挺拼命的
He's hustlin'.

599
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,230
你覺得呢
What do you think?

600
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,150
可靠嗎
Solid?

601
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,350
{\an8}電話

602
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,690
沒錯  我想報告一起沖突
Uh, uh, y-yes, I would like to report a fight going on

603
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,000
發生在伊斯萊塔大道五千街區的
at the El Michoacano restaurant in the 5000 block of

604
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,190
米卻肯飯店
the Isleta Boulevard.

605
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,400
有個男人用槍威脅另一個男人
There's a man threatening another man with a gun.

606
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,290
看著像黑幫鬧事

筆  留下彼此的信息  保險

我身上只有二三十塊錢  我只有這些

我剛兌了社保的支票

我要靠這點錢支撐到月底
It's all I have till the end of the month,

669

我是不會把它給你的

670
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,960
不給嗎
You're not?

我愿意用正確的方式解決這件事

讓我用更簡單的方法替你解決吧

把錢包給我  也許你還能離開
Give me your wallet, and maybe you walk away from this.

676
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,540
我什么都不會給你的
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

677
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,720
不  老頭
Nah, homes.

00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,920
把錢包給我
Give me your wallet.

679

先冷靜一下
Let's just stay calm here.

680

差不多有四百塊啊

你還真是嘴硬啊  老家伙
You got some crazy lip on you, old man.

686
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,030
你的命就值四百塊錢嗎
Your life worth 400 bucks?

687
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,220
屠庫  該閃人了
Hey,Tuco, time to bounce.

688
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,860
知道了  你先走
Yeah, go. Go.

689
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,850
算你今天走運  老家伙
You're...one lucky old man.

放手

放手
Let go!

696
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,850
把手舉起來
Let me see your hands!

697
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,130
舉起手來
Hands up! Now!

698
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,580
趴下
On the ground!

699
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,920
你就這點能耐
That all you got?

700
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,830
趴到地上
Get on the ground!

701
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,450
瞧你把自己搞的
Look at you.

702
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,280
你要去做證嗎
Are you gonna have to testify?

703
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,290
警察親眼目睹他犯下重罪
The cops witnessed him in the commission of a felony.

704
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,340
我的錢包在他口袋里
My wallet in his pocket.

705
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,660
再加上那把槍  他得蹲個五到十年了
Add the gun -- ‭he gets a 5-to-10 stretch.

706
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,250
兩萬五千塊
$25,000.

707
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,740
絕對是你應得的
You definitely earned it.

708
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,510
只不過你本來可以更加輕松地賺上兩倍
Still, you coulda gotten twice as much for 1/10 the hassle.

709
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,480
還可以幫這個世界清除一個垃圾
You woulda done the world a favor.

710
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,950
你的臉也不會像被棍子掄過一樣
You wouldn't look like someone took a lead pipe to your face.

711
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,280
而且等屠庫出來  他說不定會去找你
Plus, when Tuco gets out, maybe he comes looking for you.

712
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,780
說重點
Get to the point.

713
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,350
我只想問  你為了不開槍而這樣大費周張

714
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,930
