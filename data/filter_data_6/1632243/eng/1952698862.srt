1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:06,839
Problem?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,241
This is the worst cobbler
I've ever eaten.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,412
It tastes like it's made of
actual ground-up shoemaker.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,983
Amusing. A play on the
two meanings of "cobbler. "

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,221
Hey, guys. Guess who
I found at LAX?

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,556
My baby sister Priya.

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,725
Excuse me, I object.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,927
You propose a guessing game,

9
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,895
yet you don't give me
enough time to guess.

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,531
For the record,
I was going to say:

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,799
"Your sister Priya. "

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh, Sheldon. You haven't
changed a bit, have you?

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,472
Why would I change?

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,639
The hope has been that

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,708
you'd eventually bend
to public opinion.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,845
So, Priya, what brings
you back to L.A.?

17
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,980
I have a one-day layover
on my way to Toronto.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,382
Corporate merger.

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,483
Can you believe it?

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,851
Little Priya's one
of the lead attorneys

21
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,285
for the biggest
car company in India.

22
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,322
Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,692
and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company,

24
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,594
it's actually
extremely plausible.

25
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,064
And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

26
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,366
I want to catch up
with all of you,

27
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,101
but first I really
must visit the loo.

28
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,270
I'm going, too; I'll
show you where it is.

29
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,539
All right, this goes
without saying,

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,241
but I'm just going
to say it anyway.

31
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,510
Hands off my sister.

32
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,347
Why would I touch her? She's
covered with airplane germs.

33
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,984
I'm so not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

34
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,671
Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.
Oh, please.

35
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,789
My sister's much hotter

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,757
than your girlfriend,
and you know it.

37
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,492
Let's just agree
they're both hot.

38
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,862
But dude, that's my sister
you're talking about!

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,631
Okay, forget who's hotter.

40
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,667
The first time Priya came to
L.A., Leonard and I made a pact

41
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,370
out of respect to our
friendship and to you

42
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,472
that neither of us
would hit on her.

43
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,107
Did you pinky-swear?

44
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,578
Yes.

45
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,314
Okay, then.

46
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,451
Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

47
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,821
It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

48
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,923
Yeah. It's good
to see you, too.

49
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:04,924
Here you go.

50
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,075
Thanks.

51
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

52
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,134

62
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,342
So you got any special plans
with your sister?

63
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,783
Oh, not really. Just hang out.

64
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:49,452
I always tell people,
"If you have only one day

65
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:53,023
in Los Angeles,
make it a train day. "

66
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,824
Train day?

67
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:58,195
The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City,

68
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:01,331
a hotdog stand in a
converted railroad dining car.

69
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,465
Next stop, Travel Town,

70
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,770
an outdoor museum featuring
43 railroad engines,

71
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:10,373
cars, and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

72
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:14,327
And, finally, we're off to the
glitz and glamour of Hollywood,

73
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,248
for dinner at-that's right-
the Hollywood Carney's,

74
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:23,119
<i>a hotdog stand in a different
converted railroad dining car.</i>

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,223
I don't think
we're going to do that.

76
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:29,659
Well, then apparently
you hate fun.

77
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,099
Priya's not back yet?

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,550
Well, I guess
that's not unusual.

79
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,970
Women, men, the whole
sitting-standing deal.

80
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,438
So what are we talking about?

81
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,106
Uh, my plans
with Priya.

82
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:45,075
He rejected Train Day.

83
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,644
Did you make it clear that
it's two different train cars

84
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,512
turned into hotdog stands?

85
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,248
Abundantly.

86
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,149
I guess he just hates fun.

87
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,586
That's what I said!

88
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,391
Okay, so... what's
new with you guys?

89
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,826
I have a girlfriend now.

90
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,194
Hey, good for you!

91
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,862
Yeah, I just want
to put it out there

92
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:06,930
in case I inadvertently

93
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:09,699
squirt any pheromones
in your direction.

94
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:11,635
Happy?

95
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:16,273
So, Priya, what are your
plans while you're here?

96
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,275
I don't know. I just
have the one day.

97
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:21,478
Do you like trains?

98
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,946
Not particularly.

99
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:30,103
You might as well just wait
at the airport for your flight.

100
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,306
"You are in a forest.

101
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,975
"There is quicksand to the west,

102
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:39,629
a path leads to the east. "

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,332
Go east.

104
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,269
"An iron gate blocks your way. "

105
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,005
Open gate.

106
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,507
"It's locked. "

107
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,676
Hmm.

108
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:54,844
Well, so much for that.

109
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,249
It's getting pretty late.
How come you're still up?

110
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,286
I found an emulator online that
lets you play classic text-based

111
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:05,755
computer games from the 1980s.

112
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,190
That's pretty cool.

113
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:10,593
Oh, yes. It runs on the world's
most powerful graphics chip:

114
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:12,862
imagination.

115
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:15,665
You've really got
to get out more.

116
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,703
Go north.

117
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,871
"You can't go that way. "

118
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,606
Go west.

119
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,009
"A troll blocks your passage. "

120
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,311
Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

121
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,948
Kill troll.

122
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,583
"With what?"

123
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,685
With sword.

124
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,254
"You don't have the sword. "

125
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,324
Good golly, it's as if
it's actually happening to me.

126
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,928
Raj finally went to bed.

127
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,333
Sheldon's still up.

128
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,102
You said he goes
to bed at 9:00.

129
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,804
Yeah, he does, but he got caught
up in a computer game and...

130
00:05:54,805 --> 00:06:03,580
Hit troll with axe!

131
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:05,982
My, this is one tough troll.

132
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,650
Can't you get rid of him?

133
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,453
If the past is any
indication, no.

134
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,622
Leonard, I'm trapped
in quicksand!

135
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,458
The axe is dragging me down!

136
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,559
Drop axe!

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,095
Drop axe, brilliant!

138
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,433
Give me a minute.

139
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:25,885
Sheldon.

140
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,936
Hold on.

141
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:27,937
Trying to figure out

142
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:28,938
how to get the bucket,

143
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,408
so I can carry the mud
past the dragon.

144
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,743
Sheldon, you need to
work in the morning.

145
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,744
I know!

146
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:35,745
Well, then bed, mister!

147
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:38,081
Five more minutes!

148
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:39,482
Really?

149
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,718
You're going to risk getting
sleepy in the middle of your

150
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,986
thermodynamic
fluctuations seminar?

151
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,371
You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

152
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:52,796
Everyone will see
my oddly shaped uvula.

153
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,832
You don't want that, do you?

154
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,052
No.

155
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:03,907
But it's a shame our society
mocks the differently uvulated.

156
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,443
Who was at the door?

157
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,445
Uh, building manager.

158
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,313
They have to fix a pipe,

159
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:12,982
so the water'll be off
tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

160
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,517
That's unacceptable.

161
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,935
We're supposed to be
given written notice.

162
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,737
Well, no, it doesn't matter-
we'll be at work.

163
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,623
What if I spill tomato
soup on my shirt,

164
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:21,991
and have to come home to change,

165
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:24,360
only to find there's no water
for an enzyme soak?

166
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,463
Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!

167
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:29,365
I'll have the chicken noodle.
Good night!

168
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,922
We're going
to have to be very quiet.

169
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,612
I know how to
get the bucket!

170
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,580
I can turn the axe around

171
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:47,100
and use the handle to reach it.

172
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,085
Let's see.

173
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:51,521
Go north.

174
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:53,106
"You are in a forest. "

175
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,824
Go north.

176
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,259
"You are in a forest. "

177
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,694
Go north.

178
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,363
"You are in a forest. "
Oh dear, I believe I'm lost.

179
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,431
Well, I'll just have to get
a fresh start tomorrow.

180
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:04,317
No, no, no! You just
took a wrong turn.

181
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,802
You just need to map it out.

182
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:06,803
Come on, I'll help you.

183
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,271
So you stopped at the stream,

184
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,989
and you turned
north three times?

185
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,140
Yes.

186
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,742
You're right.
You're lost. Good luck.

187
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,333
Oh!

188
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,384
Leonard. Wake up.

189
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,385
Huh? Wh- Sorry.

190
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,920
For what?

191
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,356
I don't know. When I'm in bed
with a girl, it's just-

192
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,258
it's my go-to response.

193
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,260
It's 6:00. I have
to get back to Raj's

194
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,095
before he wakes up
and realizes I'm gone.

195
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,447
Oh. Right. Sure.

196
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,983
I wish you could stay
in L.A. a while longer.

197
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,001
Mmm, me, too.

198
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:39,519
You know, I was thinking:

199
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,438
There are some great
research facilities in India.

200
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,241
Where are you going
with this, Leonard?

201
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:48,995
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I don't have any real ties here,

202
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,215
so if I were to move to New
Delhi, we could, you know-

203
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,084
go out.

204
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:58,721
Leonard, didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

205
00:08:58,722 --> 00:08:59,689
Well, yes, but...

206
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,924
things have changed.

207
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,525
You know, you're older,
I'm older-

208
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,711
Look, no more
superhero bed sheets.

209
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,179
Sweetheart,

210
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,182
just because we have fun when
I come to town doesn't mean

211
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,801
I want to have a
serious relationship.

212
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,769
It doesn't?

213
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,170
Mm-mm.

214
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,440
And besides, I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

215
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:19,509
They'd have a cow.

216
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,145
Which is a much
bigger deal in India.

217
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,581
I'm not that white.

218
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,649
My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

219
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,719
I know that's not the right kind
of Indian, but it is something.

220
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,421
You're funny.

221
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:35,408
Leonard?

222
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:37,293
What?

223
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:38,895
I heard a woman laughing.

224
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:43,299
Oh, uh, yeah. I was trying to
see if I could laugh as a woman.

225
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,937
Oh! Well, good job.
Quite convincing.

226
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,406
I smell perfume.

227
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,474
Air freshener.

228
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:55,044
And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

229
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,379
Rash. That's a bad rash.

230
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,981
My sympathies.

231
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:01,484
I'm no stranger to the crimson
scourge that is dermatitis.

232
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:05,488
Can I interest you
in a topical steroid

233
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,457
from my lotion and
unguent collection?

234
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,460
Uh, yeah, yeah,
that sounds great.

235
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:12,629
Very well. I'm sure
I can find something

236
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,364
that will help
you ditch that itch.

237
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,501
Okay, he's in the
bathroom. Let's go.

238
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,173
Do you prefer
ointment or cream?

239
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,577
Cream.

240
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:28,911
With or without a numbing agent?

241
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:29,912
Without.

242
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,314
Really, Leonard?

243
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,983
There are no heroes when
it comes to dermatitis.

244
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,085
Fine. With.

245
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,920
Prescription or
non-prescription strength?

246
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,355
Use your best judgment.

247
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:44,127
Well, I think I have a
nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

248
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:47,530
It's usually indicated for
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,

249
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:51,901
but it also goes nicely
with non-mucosal body parts.

250
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,936
Sounds great.

251
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,571
Excellent choice.

252
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,942
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

253
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,962
Come on, come on, come on.

254
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,115
Priya?

255
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,685
Good morning, Sheldon.

256
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:13,189
For shame, Leonard, for shame.

257
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,358
And to think,

258
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,510
I was ready to waste

259
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,531
the last of my good
hemorrhoid cream on you.

260
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:31,422
Making pretty
good time, huh?

261
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:34,934
Is that really what you want
to talk about, Leonard?

262
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:36,386
No.

263
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,804
What do you want to talk about?

264
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:38,955
Please don't tell anyone

265
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:40,423
I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

266
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,425
There it is.

267
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:45,294
What if someone asks?

268
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,897
No one's going to ask if I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

269
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:52,001
Perhaps, but they might ask me
something else.

270
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,336
Like what?
Like

271
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,857
"Has Leonard betrayed any
of his friends recently?"

272
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,009
Priya and I are both adults.

273
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,711
I didn't betray Raj.

274
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:05,281
In fact, you did,
but I was referring to Howard.

275
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,349
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,334
April 12, 2005.

277
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:10,420
Bob's Big Boy,
Toluca Lake.

278
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:14,023
Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time.

279
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,160
She was enjoying the sweet taste
of Hindu rebellion

280
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:19,929
in the form of a Bob's
Super Big Boy hamburger.

281
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,197
In order
to preserve

282
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,400
your friendship, you and Howard
made a pinky swear

283
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,236
that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

284
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,939
I had a patty melt.

285
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,808
Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

286
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,743
And Raj.
All right, and Raj.

287
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,395
And me.

288
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,146
You?

289
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,731
Violation of the
Roommate Agreement's

290
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,150
overnight guest
notification clause.

291
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,020
Okay, fine,
I- I'm a horrible human being.

292
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,122
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

293
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,825
You're far too short
to be Darth Vader.

294
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:52,662
At best you might be
a turncoat Ewok.

295
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:56,065
My point is: Priya's gone
and it would be much better

296
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,751
if no one else found out
about us.

297
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,638
You mean you want me
to keep a secret?

298
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,672
Yes.

299
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,340
You know I can't
keep a secret.

300
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,408
You can if you try.

301
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,643
Think about
it this way:

302
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,545
um, if I were Batman
and you were Alfred,

303
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:11,481
you'd keep that
secret, right?

304
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,267
Why do you get
to be Batman?

305
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:16,402
Because Batman has the secret.

306
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,237
Alfred has secrets, too.

307
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:19,822
Like what?
Alfred knows

308
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,125
that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

309
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,609
Which I've now just
told to Batman.

310
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,945
See, I cannot
keep a secret.

311
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,167
Ta-dah!

312
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,201
What?

313
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,637
Ta-dah.

314
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:35,571
It's short for...

315
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,540
♪ Da-da-da-da! ♪

316
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,176
Kind of busy here, Sheldon.

317
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,511
I know,
that's why I shortened it.

318
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:45,048
What do you want?

319
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:48,751
I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

320
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,186
What alibi?

321
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:51,120
You've asked me

322
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,456
to lie on your behalf,
and as you know,

323
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,459
I am deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty,

324
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,593
so I've provided you

325
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:59,796
with an ironclad alibi.

326
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,465
You couldn't have spent
last night with Priya

327
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,534
because you were
with another woman.

328
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,769
Oh, I'm so sure
I'm gonna regret this,

329
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,872
but who was I with?

330
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:13,976
The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

331
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,411
Oh, God.

332
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:18,514
You met her at Pasadena's most
popular Irish watering hole,

333
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:21,951
Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie
spends her nights tending bar

334
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:25,154
with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

335
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,258
"Leonard, call me if you
are interested in coitus.

336
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,895
Sincerely,
Maggie McGarry. "

337
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,180
And if anyone were

338
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:39,102
to actually call that number,
they will hear this.

339
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,204
Top of the morning to you.

340
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:43,373
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

341
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:48,745
Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

342
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,147
It's pretty convincing, huh?

343
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:52,415
That wasn't even
a real person.

344
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,668
And here is
the clincher:

345
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,323
a lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

346
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:01,591
Where'd you get that?

347
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:04,394
From an orangutan
in the primate lab.

348
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,494
An orangutan?

349
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:06,379
Well, no one's going

350
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,598
to run a DNA test
on it, Leonard.

351
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,666
Honestly, you overthink
everything.

352
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,970
Sheldon, I don't need an alibi.

353
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,738
Nobody's going to ask
about last night

354
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,174
as long as you just
zip your lip.

355
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:22,779
Thank you.

356
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,114
Now, don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.

357
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,029
Hey.

358
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,297
Hey, Leonard, will you
please tell Howard

359
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,433
my sister has never
been attracted to him?

360
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,268
Come on, Raj,

361
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:46,769
how am I supposed to know

362
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,006
who she is attracted to
or was attracted to

363
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:54,644
or who she might be
attracted to in the future?

364
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:57,280
And I have nothing
to contribute

365
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:00,149
to this conversation.

366
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:03,152
Because I, too,
know absolutely nothing

367
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:06,222
about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

368
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,725
And with that,
I will re-zip my lip.

369
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,929
Hey, so what did
you guys think

370
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,947
<i>of the new episode
of Caprica last night?</i>

371
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:15,932
I didn't see it.

372
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,866
Didn't see it?

373
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,468
What were you doing?

374
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,406
Uh, I was out.

375
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,208
<i>What, on Caprica night?</i>

376
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,510
Yeah, I, uh, went
for a drink.

377
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:28,744
Really, you?

378
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,514
Where, w-where'd
you go?

379
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,749
To, uh...

380
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,691
Lucky Baldwin's.

381
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:45,595
Oh, I've heard
of that place.

382
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:49,332
Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

383
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,100
Yes.

384
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,401
Did you meet

385
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,669
anyone interesting there,

386
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,907
perhaps a promiscuous,
redheaded barmaid?

387
00:16:57,908 --> 00:16:59,909
As a matter of fact...
I- I-I-I-I can't, I can't,

388
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,344
I can't do it.

389
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,913
Sure you can, you're doing
fine, it's very believable.

390
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,383
I'm sorry, Raj,
but the truth is,

391
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:09,252
I was with Priya
last night.

392
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,453
Don't listen to him.

393
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:12,221
He's still light-headed
from all the Irish whiskey

394
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,090
and pickled eggs
in his system.

395
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,025
What were you doing
with Priya?

396
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,059
I believe they engaged
in coitus,

397
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,861
but more
importantly,

398
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,630
if Leonard had not abandoned
his story,

399
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,065
would you have found it
plausible?

400
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,600
You slept with my sister?!

401
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:25,535
Yeah.

402
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,770
How could you?
We had a pact.

403
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,572
Excuse me, I think
"How could you? She's my sister"

404
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:32,775
takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinky swear.

405
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,193
May I point out,

406
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:36,445
in a parallel universe,
your friends are saying

407
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,081
"Maggie McGarry-
she sounds lovely. "

408
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:42,552
Look, I-I admit it, I may
have crossed a line here,

409
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:46,122
but come on, Raj, your
sister is a grown woman,

410
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:49,025
and to her, I'm a forbidden
piece of white chocolate.

411
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,127
I don't believe it.

412
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:52,511
This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust.

413
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:55,181
No, w-w-would it
help if I told you

414
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:59,135
that I offered her my heart,
and she kind of stomped on it?

415
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,904
How hard did she stomp?

416
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:03,906
Very hard.

417
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,225
Okay, I'm good.

418
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,279
Well, Raj,

419
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,683
I just want to say that I'd
never betray your trust.

420
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:16,235
Unlike Leonard,
I respect you.

421
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:17,253
Really?

422
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:19,905
Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,058
Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj

424
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,694
about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

425
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:28,831
Dude, I put that thing
on my face!

426
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,701
I think a more amusing
violation of Raj's trust

427
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,337
is when Howard convinced him
that foreigners give presents

428
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:37,256
to Americans
on Thanksgiving.

429
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,675
Hey, I didn't see
you giving back

430
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,511
your Snoopy
snow cone maker.

431
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,646
That was all a lie?

432
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,781
This year's gifts
are already wrapped.

433
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,517
And as long as we're talking
about betraying our friends,

434
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,987
how about the month Sheldon
spent grinding up insects

435
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:52,722
and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

436
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:54,090
Well, excuse me.

437
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,691
That was not a betrayal.

438
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,827
That was an experiment
to determine

439
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:02,031
at what concentration
food starts tasting "mothy. "

440
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:05,201
You put moths in my food?!

441
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:09,071
For science.

442
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,540
I can't believe you kissed
my sister with moth mouth.

443
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,711
Well, I can't believe you
used Sheldon's toothbrush.

444
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:18,014
You used my toothbrush?

445
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:20,916
Not the brush part,
just the little rubber thing

446
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:24,754
to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

447
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:33,429
Okay, I-I think
it's safe to say

448
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,930
that we've all done
some things

449
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:36,699
we're not
particularly proud of.

450
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:38,868
But come on,
we're friends.

451
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:42,838
Friends overlook
each other's minor lapses.

452
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,842
For the record, Howard, I'm
sorry that I broke our pact.

453
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,161
Thank you.

454
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:51,997
And I'm sorry
about your phone

455
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:53,816
and Thanksgiving.

456
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,184
And while we're at it,

457
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,620
you don't have to wash our
clothes on the Fourth of July.

458
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,173
As long as we're apologizing,

459
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:04,427
Sheldon, I'm, I'm sorry
I used your toothbrush.

460
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,662
And I'm sorry...

461
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,164
but that behavior
is beyond the pale

462
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,832
and cannot be tolerated.

463
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,967
We are no longer friends.

464
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:16,005
I got you a talking Thomas the
Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

465
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,974
With real puffing smoke?

466
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,209
Yes.

467
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,528
All right.

468
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:26,549
But I'm watching you.

469
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,270
Hey, you've got Snoopy out.

470
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:42,488
Can I have a snow cone?

471
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,358
Well, sure.

472
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:48,277
This is pretty good.

473
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:49,562
What flavor is this?

474
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:52,465
Guess.

475
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,066
Papaya?
No.

476
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,702
Guava?
You're so close.

477
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,703
I give up.

478
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:00,106
Mango caterpillar.

479
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:03,365
What are
you doing?!

480
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,474
You said you
liked it.
