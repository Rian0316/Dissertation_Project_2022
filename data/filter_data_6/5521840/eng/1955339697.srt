00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,686
This is what happens when you
miss an episode of "Shameless."

1
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:08,389
Your entire life goes
completely to shit.

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:11,725
<i>Anyone try to find me</i>

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,585
when I was in the
ICU for the last month?

4
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:15,987
We were kind of hoping you were dead.

5
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,010
- <i>You good?</i>

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,377
- <i>I learned I'm not an alcoholic.</i>

7
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,700
What about finishing college?

8
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:21,635
- Is that off the table?
- I got a professor.

9
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:23,816
Uh, he's gonna help me
find something... a tech startup.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,918
It just might be a while before
I get paid, you know?

11
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,675
This management
thing is a pain in my ass.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,009
I'm losing money.

13
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,345
Tell you what. Pay yourself

14
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:32,224
an extra 50Â¢ an hour,
make up the difference.

15
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:34,081
- An extra buck an hour.
- Done.

16
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,552
Nice stroller. Where'd you get it?

17
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,855
- <i>Oh, I found it in
the park, I'm gonna sell it.</i>

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,157
Dom won't go down on me
'cause I'm not circumcised.

19
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:46,660
It has all this extra skin,
and it kind of freaks me out.

20
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,095
I can't feel a thing.

21
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,530
- Don't worry.

22
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,498
You will soon.

23
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:53,734
I'm meeting an old high
school friend for dinner.

24
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,180
- <i>An old friend?</i>
- <i>Denise.</i>

25
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,404
Please tell me she has a dick.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,074
You have no balance sheet, no
income or cash flow forecast.

27
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,077
Our yield on gross revenues are shit.

28
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,879
Are we seriously not gonna have sex?

29
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,247
'Cause I kind of took a Viagra.

30
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:10,751
Oh, yeah, just walk right
by, ignore your father

31
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:13,454
<i>that you tried to drown in the river.</i>

32
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,090
<i>I was only telling the truth!</i>

33
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:29,752
- <i>Come on, Frank!</i>

34
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,576
<i>Open the damn door!</i>

35
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,346
<i>Come on, Frank!</i>

36
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,618
<i>Open the door.</i>

37
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,625
Hey, Hector?

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,226
Hi, it's Fiona.

39
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:49,661
Oh, shit. Hang on!

40
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,865
Hi, you still there?

41
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,634
Sorry. Uh...

42
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:56,902
Can you work today?

43
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,970
Santos called in sick again.

44
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:02,774
Yeah, I'm tired of his bullshit, too.

45
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,376
You can?

46
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,610
Oh, that's great. Okay.

47
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,612
I'll see you at ten.

48
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,293
I thought you were living at Caleb's?

49
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,994
Caleb's sleeping with a chick.

50
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,597
- He's bi?
- No dude is bi, all right?

51
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,399
You lick dick, you're
supposed to be gay.

52
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:29,768
So you guys broke up?

53
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:32,070
Haven't decided yet. Probably.

54
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,773
God, I can't believe
he's licking vag, too.

55
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:37,842
All right, can you guys please
stop talking about licking vag?

56
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:40,288
- You're gonna give me a boner.
- You sleep at all last night?

57
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,946
No, if I wake up with morning
wood, it'll pop my stitches.

58
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,782
You're 16. How are you
gonna not get wood for 72 hours?

59
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,517
Eyes on the prize, my brother.

60
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:48,851
Yeah, which is?

61
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,753
A blowie from Dominique.

62
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,223
The chick who made you cut your dick?

63
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,024
Yeah, man, no girl's worth that.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,392
She didn't make me.

65
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,027
I wanted to.

66
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,196
You guys just don't
understand true love.

67
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:01,864
Uh, you know, it's
pretty cold out there.

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,433
You better put on a turtleneck.

69
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,435
Oh, oh! Excuse you.

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,882
Oh, you got to forgive Carl,
his manners were in his foreskin.

71
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:10,139
Uh, stop it! It just
gives me the willies

72
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,886
thinking about someone near
my junk with a knife.

73
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,476
Where is my vacuum cleaner?

74
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,946
- Upstairs probably.
- Kev, grab our cleaning shit.

75
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:18,715
What's all that crap?

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm helping Fiona with the
bills over at Patsy's.

77
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,652
Place is in a financial shitstorm.

78
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,087
Yeah, the Alibi, too.

79
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,122
Svetlana's getting things in order,

80
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:28,324
which makes me the house husband.

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,159
I keep forgetting about
the weird situation

82
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,928
you got going on with the two wives.

83
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:33,663
It's not weird. It's modern.

84
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,565
You're gonna have to
draw me a Venn diagram

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,933
to explain how that works.

86
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:37,967
What's up with mopey?

87
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,335
Ah, boy trouble.

88
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,238
Girl trouble.

89
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:45,742
I'll draw you a Venn
diagram to explain that, too.

90
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,343
Where's my vacuum?

91
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,444
What are you doing?

92
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,446
Uh, vacuum, hall closet.

93
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,081
And I'm getting rid of Frank's shit.

94
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,983
That fuckhead's back in the house?

95
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,186
Yeah, nailed the door
shut from the inside.

96
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,122
- How's he getting in and out?
- I don't know.

97
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,024
Window? Ladder?

98
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,192
Get a restraining order on his ass.

99
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,028
That would mean that I cared.

100
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:06,796
And I don't anymore.

101
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,699
Aren't you angry with him about
destroying your future?

102
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,371
Did me a favor.

103
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:18,241
Come on, help me
bring his crap downstairs.

104
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:24,314
Good morning, my wasted sperms.

105
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:25,982
Frank, you're walking.

106
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,328
In a weird way, but you're walking.

107
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,985
- Why don't you go away, Frank?

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,521
Is that any way to greet
your soon to be ex-father?

109
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:32,522
Ex-father?

110
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:33,956
We would be so lucky.

111
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:37,160
Filling out the paperwork to disinherit

112
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,695
you
abortion-should-have-beens.

113
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,829
Disinherit? Wow.

114
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:41,230
So we don't get that jelly jar?

115
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,810
- Or the three pieces of silverware

116
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:43,911
you stole from the Ramada Inn?

117
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,702
Or the shame and the embarrassment?

118
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,203
Go ahead, joke all you like.

119
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:49,305
But once my parental
rights are terminated,

120
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,008
you can no longer use the
Gallagher family name.

121
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,643
Hallelujah!

122
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,879
I'm just gonna be like
Cher and go by Fiona.

123
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,414
Here's your shit.

124
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,916
I'm taking my room back.

125
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,584
And I'm padlocking the house.

126
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,386
Aw, you made me toast.

127
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:05,555
Thanks.

128
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,690
Buh-bye, got to go to work.

129
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:09,726
You can't get rid of me that easily.

130
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,328
Has she talked to anybody
about what happened at the wedding?

131
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:14,163
- Not to me.
- Me neither.

132
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,399
Tumors are repressed feelings, you know.

133
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,102
- Come on. Liam, let's go.
- What?

134
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,070
He's the only one that
stands a fighting chance

135
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,772
to become a real Gallagher.

136
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,970
- No fucking way!
- Eh, you can't just take him, Frank.

137
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,377
Yes, I can. I'm his father.

138
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,746
And he is staying in the will.

139
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,582
Aren't you?

140
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,286
Do you think, in his
own way, Frank's actually

141
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,422
a pretty good dad?

142
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,556
No.

143
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,758
Jesus.

144
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:43,226
- Well, look who it is...

145
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,794
Beauty and the Beast.

146
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,863
I'll leave it to you
two to figure out who's who.

147
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,109
Too bad you're walking again, Frank.

148
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,899
I was praying for permanent paralysis.

149
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,367
Where'd you get the stroller, Debs?

150
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:53,903
The only thing Monica and I could afford

151
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:56,939
to stroll you guys around
in was a Kroger shopping cart.

152
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,808
Hey, give me that! It's not yours.

153
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,711
Well, apparently it's not yours either.

154
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,579
- Ugh.
- Maureen Wilson.

155
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,581
Looks like you
already cleaned out the cash,

156
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,418
Little Orphan Angry, so, uh...

157
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:09,652
I'll take the platinum.

158
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,387
You can't do that, Frank!

159
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,424
Should I call Ms. Wilson,
let her know you found it?

160
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,225
Fine, take it. Careful, Liam.

161
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,795
I used to think Frank
would be a real dad someday, too.

162
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,098
You and that little spic you
sneezed out of the cavern

163
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,267
you called your
uterus better start looking

164
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,501
for a new last name.

165
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm disinheriting both of you

166
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,682
and taking back the Gallagher name.

167
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,173
Gladly.

168
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,241
And while I'm at it, Franny's gonna go

169
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,310
by her middle name from
now on... Harriet.

170
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:36,479
Harry. So she has no
more connection to you.

171
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,147
Harry!

172
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,583
Well, that's a perfect
name for the diesel dyke

173
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,852
she's gonna grow up to be someday.

174
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,821
Come on, kid. We got work to do.

175
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,622
- Hey, Carl.

176
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,302
Hey, bunch of us are going
to the movies tonight.

177
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:49,826
You want to come?

178
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,961
I told you, I can't hang
out with you for 72 hours.

179
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,541
Thought that meant we
just couldn't fool around?

180
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,665
Even just being in your
vicinity gives me a boner.

181
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,467
That's so sweet.

182
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,534
Seriously, stop.

183
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,636
Hey, freak fuck!

184
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,339
Heard you got a tranny operation.

185
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:05,174
I only told a couple of people.

186
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,509
Got your penis chopped off.

187
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,044
Now you're a lady.

188
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,846
Not that you were that
far off to begin with.

189
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,174
See you around, Bruce Jenner.

190
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,527
Hey, Bruce Jenner was the
dude, so fuck you guys.

191
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:15,117
Thanks for the compliment.

192
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,719
Don't listen to them.

193
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,554
Okay, I think you're
manly for what you did.

194
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,658
And when the 72 hours
and one second is over,

195
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:26,128
I'm gonna loosen your belt,

196
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,864
then take off your pants...

197
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,198
- No.
- Then your underwear.

198
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:31,133
No, no, stop.

199
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,569
- Then suck your lollipop.
- I'm serious.

200
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,037
Oh, fuck.

201
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:37,740
I thought you said I
just couldn't go near you?

202
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,408
Where are you going? We have class.

203
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,644
Doctor, clinic, now.

204
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:45,915
That's a burger
well-done, with crispy fries,

205
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,383
and a Denver omelet, extra ham.

206
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:49,485
And let me get you a
refill on these sodas.

207
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,754
Yeah.

208
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,423
We'll get that cleared
up for you in just a sec.

209
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,260
- You get my order on 14?
- Oh, yeah, I did.

210
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,661
You're two hours late.

211
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:01,664
I called Melinda. Said it wasn't busy.

212
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,234
So you figured you'd just
come in whenever you felt like it?

213
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,836
I had laundry to do.

214
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:08,204
Melinda was cool with it.

215
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:12,041
I'm glad you guys feel
like you can just change

216
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,543
my schedule whenever you want.

217
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:18,114
What Sean always let us do.

218
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,450
In case you haven't
noticed, Sean's not here anymore.

219
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:24,787
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

220
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:25,900
- Game Change, please hold.

221
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,356
Phillip. Tito.

222
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,025
- Senior intern.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

223
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,604
All right, follow
me, I'll show you around.

224
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,161
Uh, you can start by getting coffee

225
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,362
for the Three Musketeers.

226
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,298
- Who?
- The owners, Phillip.

227
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,799
- Two million!

228
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:44,407
This is, uh, Sarah, head
of sales and marketing.

229
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,475
Black coffee, extra hot, splash of 2%.

230
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:49,111
Jesse, I buy ad space on
your stupid network every Sunday.

231
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,714
Least you could do is cut
me a deal for the playoffs.

232
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:53,983
Joe, brains behind the
operation and the VC guy.

233
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,329
Raised the money to start this place.

234
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,919
- He okay?
- Uh, new heated floors.

235
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,387
- He gets cold.

236
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,301
Green tea, steeped for three
minutes, one Truvia.

237
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,591
Gene. Tech.

238
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,659
Four double shots of
espresso before noon,

239
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,940
wears a new pair of socks
every day, throws out the old ones.

240
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,296
You'll help him put them on.

241
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,809
He doesn't like to take the goggles off.

242
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,132
- Copy that.
- Uh...

243
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,634
Sign is self-explanatory.

244
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:13,069
Kitchen is yours, too.

245
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,682
There's a grocery
list on the bulletin board.

246
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:15,816
- Three million!

247
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,573
All right! Whoo!

248
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:22,612
Hey, uh, listen, you get paid, you know,

249
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,013
being the senior intern?

250
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:26,282
No, um, but last senior
intern just got a job

251
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,817
at Porsche marketing.

252
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:31,754
100 grand a year, was only
here eight months, so...

253
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:34,457
But you can get started with
the coffee and the tea.

254
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:36,092
- Yeah.
- All right?

255
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,493
And, Phillip? Um...

256
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,529
get me an iced soy latte.

257
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,136
<i>Home and garden, line four.</i>

258
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,871
Buenos dÃ­as.

259
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,539
Frank Gallagher.

260
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,375
My son, Liam.

261
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,110
Looking for some workers to help

262
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,846
with a home masonry project.

263
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,348
Pick three guys with a strong physique

264
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:03,319
and a dumb disposition.

265
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:06,956
- You, you, you.

266
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,858
You make me proud, my one and only son.

267
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:09,992
Very proud.

268
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,728
Uh, the supplies I need.

269
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,733
<i>Toby, report to hardware.</i>

270
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,669
- Frank fucking Gallagher.

271
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,905
You got money for once, Frank?

272
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,507
Credit card.

273
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:27,810
And could I get a $400 cash
advance on that card?

274
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,046
And keep $100 for yourself.

275
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,848
Whatever you say, Mrs. Wilson.

276
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,391
Yo.

277
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,393
How come you didn't come home last night

278
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,262
or answer my texts?

279
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,430
Busy.

280
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,902
Care to elaborate?

281
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,403
I don't know, ask Denise.

282
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:56,205
Is that what this is about?

283
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,373
My high school girlfriend?

284
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:59,875
Your high school
girlfriend who you fuck.

285
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
are you talking about?

286
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,080
- I saw you with her last night.
- You're spying on me?

287
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:06,449
Yeah, 'cause I knew you'd
been cheating on me.

288
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,017
I wasn't cheating.

289
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:09,885
So you didn't fuck Denise, then?

290
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,688
Cheating would be if I
sucked some guy's cock, all right?

291
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,890
- So you didn't sleep with her?
- I didn't say that.

292
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,637
- Well, I'm confused.
- How do you think I feel?

293
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,038
You're the one calling me a cheater.

294
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,273
You still haven't answered the question.

295
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:22,264
Did you or did you not fuck Denise?

296
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,601
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

297
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,470
- She's an old friend.
- Who you fuck!

298
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,316
We've been sleeping
together since we were kids.

299
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,984
Don't make this into something
more than it is.

300
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,208
You're taking your dick,

301
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,976
you're putting it into a vagina.

302
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,656
And you're telling me
you've never done that before?

303
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,746
No, I haven't!

304
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,981
- I'm gay.
- So am I!

305
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:42,251
Sticking my dick in a friend's
vagina doesn't make me not gay.

306
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:43,753
Are you hearing this, Raul?

307
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,788
This is why I didn't want to tell you...

308
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,134
Because I didn't want you freaking out

309
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,257
the way you are right now.

310
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,925
Oh, gee, sorry.

311
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,061
Hey, how should I react when you say

312
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,173
you've been screwing a woman?

313
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,997
I don't know.

314
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:57,600
Maybe by being more
accepting of your partner's normal,

315
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,435
sexually fluid experiences,

316
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,737
maybe by sharing some of your own.

317
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,773
I don't have anything to share.

318
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,508
I'm gay, all right?

319
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,343
100% gay.

320
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:10,346
- No one's 100% anything.
- Yeah, well, I am, all right?

321
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,848
So now this inexperienced vagina-fucker

322
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:15,684
has got to get to work.

323
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,525
Uh, you Trisha?

324
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,793
I am.

325
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,394
It's brand-new.

326
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:44,814
How much did you want, again?

327
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:47,516
Like I said in the ad, at
the store, it's 2,500,

328
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,451
but I can let it go for two.

329
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,986
How about 1,500?

330
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:52,555
You're haggling with me?

331
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,191
Isn't that what Craigslist is all about?

332
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:57,560
It's also about people
advertising baby stuff,

333
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,795
and when the pregnant lady shows up,

334
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,697
they cut the baby out of her stomach.

335
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,305
- You doing all right?

336
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,740
You're sewing on my penis, you tell me.

337
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:15,377
You don't have a lot of undamaged
skin left down here.

338
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,646
Yeah, because you chopped it all off.

339
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,982
I warned you this would be difficult.

340
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,651
It's harder than I
thought to not get an erection.

341
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,588
You can get through this,
son. Just put your mind to it.

342
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:28,490
I literally think about
sex 70,000 times a day.

343
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:31,193
Have to find other things to focus on.

344
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:33,095
Like what?

345
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,830
Hairy balls can work.

346
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,099
Or your grandmother naked.

347
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,934
I've even had patients suggest to me

348
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,237
that watching Ted Cruz on CSPAN

349
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:43,806
is an effective measure for
preventing an erection.

350
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,879
Okay, guys, here's your Snappy.

351
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,847
- Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap.

352
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,127
Here's... I don't know what
this is, but you guys like it,

353
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:55,417
and here's your tennis racket.

354
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:56,660
All right, you guys play.

355
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,121
Daddy's got to clean this
place up, all right?

356
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:01,190
Yevgeny, get that out of your mouth!

357
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,392
What are you doing, man?
You're gonna light yourself up

358
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,527
like a Christmas tree.
How'd you get my phone?

359
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:08,597
How'd you get my phone? Come on, now.

360
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,199
I got to move all these weights.

361
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,901
I got to clean this place up.

362
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:15,104
Okay, let me just take a
break here for just a second.

363
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,973
You know what? I'm gonna
use you as my weights.

364
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,419
- Don't worry, Gemma.

365
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:21,310
I'll use you in my next set.

366
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:23,545
- Whee!
- Whee!

367
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:24,914
- Whee!

368
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:26,315
Shit, you are heavy.

369
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,657
* Happy birthday to you *

370
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,726
* Happy birthday to you *

371
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,397
* Happy birthday, dear Sherrie *

372
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,300
* Happy birthday to you *

373
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,144
Excuse me?

374
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,446
I'm looking for Chad. Is he around?

375
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:59,281
Chad!

376
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,791
Okay.

377
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:11,126
Thank you.

378
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,462
Actually, uh, sorry to bother you.

379
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,497
I work at Patsy's. I
wanted to let Chad know...

380
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,765
Where?

381
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,133
Patsy's...

382
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:20,302
Pies.

383
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:22,137
Oh, yeah, the dump on Franklin.

384
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,372
You know it.

385
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,474
Uh, I've been filling in as manager.

386
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,043
I'd like to quit, go
back to waiting tables.

387
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,280
That's fine. Do whatever you want.

388
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:33,048
Are you allowed to say that?

389
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,050
I mean, don't you have
to run it by Chad first?

390
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,089
Red velvet.

391
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,898
I know it's not your favorite, boss,

392
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,556
but Sherrie wanted it for her birthday.

393
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,391
Oh.

394
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:44,159
- Hey.
- Hi.

395
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,728
Zoning board is on my ass.

396
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,830
Where is that, uh, environmental
impact study

397
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,065
for the redevelopment project?

398
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,033
- Which one?
- The west side.

399
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:53,969
I'll call Fitz, tell
him we need it ASAP.

400
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,571
Oh, and this one.

401
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:58,374
She works at that
shithole over on Franklin.

402
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,576
- Patsy's.
- Yeah, she wants to quit.

403
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,411
- You do?
- Well, as manager.

404
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:04,146
I want to go back to waiting tables.

405
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,548
- We should just shut it down.
- What?

406
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:09,218
Eh, it's just... it's
not worth the aggravation.

407
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:11,553
- Well, you can't close it.
- Why not?

408
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,155
I depend upon it to feed my family.

409
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,690
You just quit.

410
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,126
That's the problem with having a family.

411
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,538
Well, I didn't think it
would lead to you closing it.

412
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:20,329
Well, it's on its last legs, anyway.

413
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,042
We're planning on
redeveloping that whole block.

414
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,417
You sure?

415
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,612
Remember what happened to
that chicken place over on LaSalle?

416
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,514
Homeless guy started that
kitchen fire to stay warm,

417
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:29,104
burnt half the building down.

418
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,107
If I stayed on as manager,
would you keep it open?

419
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:36,211
Fine. Just don't lose any money.

420
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,414
Well, the only way to do
that is to fire people.

421
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:40,616
I mean, the old manager
hired so many unreliable...

422
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:41,950
Did you hear what I said?

423
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,685
Just keep it afloat.

424
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay.

425
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:56,432
Andale, gringos! Andale!

426
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,084
Whoo.

427
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,151
Nice wheels.

428
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,488
Ah, thanks, I jacked it...

429
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,590
or it's one of my boss's cars.

430
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,425
Sent me to get it detailed.

431
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,704
Looks pretty clean already.

432
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,046
Yeah, I was thinking

433
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:27,941
about just wiping it down,
pocketing the 100 bucks.

434
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,132
I don't have a lot of
time, so I ordered for you.

435
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,567
Sweet, thanks.

436
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,502
So what's up?

437
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,237
You sounded pretty freaked.

438
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,106
I, uh...

439
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,575
confronted Caleb about that chick.

440
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,444
He's screwing her.

441
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,324
I guess there's something to
be said for honesty, right?

442
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:46,582
Except he says it's not cheating.

443
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,250
How'd he come up with that reasoning?

444
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:52,454
Says if it were a
guy, then he'd be cheating.

445
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,524
I guess that kind
of sort of makes sense.

446
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,437
I'd rather have my girlfriend
sleeping with other chicks

447
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,861
than some dude.

448
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,529
- You ever fuck a guy before?
- Fuck, no.

449
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:01,541
'Cause you're 100% straight, right?

450
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,798
Absolutely.

451
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,266
Yeah, well, Caleb's trying to argue

452
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:06,016
that no one's 100% anything.

453
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:10,042
It's cheater's logic.

454
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:12,111
Ever think about experimenting?

455
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,246
With a dude?

456
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,315
No.

457
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,117
Think it makes you less...

458
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:20,252
worldly or some shit?

459
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,654
Why?

460
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,923
Are you thinking about experimenting
with a chick?

461
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,659
No.

462
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,461
I don't know, maybe.

463
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,300
So what would you do, right?

464
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,236
You're with this chick, bombshell chick,

465
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,971
you're fooling around, you know?

466
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,640
Look down, you realize a guy had joined.

467
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:44,843
He's sucking your dick.

468
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,812
How far along am I?

469
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:51,817
- So you're like 93% straight.
- It's like 96% straight.

470
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,819
All right.

471
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,628
"Help wanted"?

472
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:04,163
Yeah, I got to cover the mornings

473
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:06,965
when you need to do your laundry, right?

474
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,769
Girl, you got a target on your back.

475
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,138
You're the bitch who told
me to stay home this morning.

476
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:20,445
Let's make things a little easier
for us this time, Harry.

477
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,817
We'll steal the stroller someone wants

478
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:28,187
instead of finding someone who
wants the stroller we have.

479
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,125
And now we wait and
see what happens, Harry.

480
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,406
Holy shit, Harry, we
got an email already.

481
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,608
It's for the Bugaboo stroller.

482
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:54,413
Hello, Melanie?

483
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,416
Hi, you contacted me about
the Baby Bugaboo?

484
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:00,185
Yes, it's still
here... I mean available.

485
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,520
Uh, just one sec.

486
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,996
Hi, sorry. Um...

487
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:13,198
where are you coming from?

488
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:15,267
Great, I'm not too far from you.

489
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,770
Why don't we meet at the,
uh, Trader Joe's on Ontario?

490
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,006
Great, I'll see you there in 30 minutes.

491
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,023
Excuse me?

492
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:41,226
I saw the "help wanted"
sign at the window.

493
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:42,628
Uh-huh.

494
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:44,897
Can I leave my rÃ©sumÃ© with you?

495
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:47,466
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks.

496
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:50,302
Uh-huh.

497
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,548
Oh, fu...

498
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,484
Son of a bitch!

499
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,085
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
choo.

500
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:18,563
Hey, Hully Gully, I just
cleaned that floor, man.

501
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,667
Man, what're you laughing at?

502
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:24,002
Again with my clean floor.

503
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,438
Here we go.

504
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,140
Oh!

505
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:31,810
No, you didn't.

506
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,912
No, you didn't!

507
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,147
Ah, screw this.

508
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:36,615
Food fight!

509
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,085
Animal crackers, flying in!

510
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,853
- Oh!

511
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:44,356
Oh!

512
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,592
Work looks good, gentlemen.

513
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:49,328
Gracias.

514
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:50,829
Fiona's gonna be mad.

515
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:52,597
Mm, tough titties.

516
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:56,435
Gallagher and Son would like
to thank you for your efficiency.

517
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,138
Uno momento.

518
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:03,175
This is where we lowball the illegals.

519
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,211
They got nothing over
us after the work is done.

520
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:10,716
Here we go, as promised, $50 each.

521
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,118
You said 100.

522
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:15,554
How about we make it 75,

523
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,523
and I won't have you deported?

524
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,959
- How about we make it 100,

525
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,595
and we won't murder you and
the little brown boy in your sleep?

526
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,367
You've jogged my memory.

527
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:31,036
It... it was $100 each.

528
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,537
I was in a coma.

529
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,639
I-I was in the
hospital. I was in a coma.

530
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,375
I get...

531
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,047
Lucky you caught me.

532
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,483
Was about to go home.

533
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:46,685
I don't feel so lucky right now.

534
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,821
I can barely find any
skin you haven't torn

535
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,890
to sew back together.

536
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:53,925
Jesus!

537
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,894
I did the best I could.

538
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,963
Put on your pants.

539
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:02,401
Carefully.

540
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,770
If it happens again, you're
gonna be in trouble.

541
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:08,407
I may have no choice but to
turn that thing into a vagina.

542
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,042
Hairy balls, son.

543
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:12,077
Hairy balls.

544
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,115
You got restaurant experience?

545
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,551
I've been waiting tables since I was 13.

546
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:22,254
- Any felony convictions?
- Nope.

547
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,755
Are you working right now?

548
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,725
The place I was at, Pelloni's,
closed down.

549
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,362
Uh, it's being turned into
a Urban Outfitters.

550
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:32,409
The owner here wanted to
close this place down, too,

551
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,433
but she's giving me a
shot to turn it around.

552
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:36,101
Sounds cool.

553
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:38,470
That is just the kind of enthusiasm
that I'm looking for.

554
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:41,039
- When can you start?
- As soon as you want me to.

555
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,708
That's great. It's minimum
wage, plus shared tips.

556
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:45,544
See you tomorrow at noon for training.

557
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,679
Thank you so much, Miss Gallagher.

558
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,121
- Hey, Olga?
- Yeah?

559
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:57,622
You're fired.

560
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,491
You can't fire me.

561
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:02,627
I'm the only woman of
color, and I will sue your ass.

562
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:05,597
Excuse me, where's the manager?

563
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,699
Hi, I saw your "help wanted" sign.

564
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,437
You're hired.

565
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:14,406
Come back tomorrow at noon for training.

566
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:15,774
Thank you.

567
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:09,661
<i>Hairy balls, son.</i>

568
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,897
<i>Hairy balls.</i>

569
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,192
You're making me so wet.

570
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:15,927
Here, feel.

571
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:17,862
Yeah, it's like a rainforest,

572
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:19,364
like a Slip'N Slide.

573
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,132
Yeah.

574
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,535
Lick my pussy.

575
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,769
Okay.

576
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:30,141
Mm-hmm.

577
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:35,046
Oh, God!

578
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,915
I could come right now!

579
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,285
I'm not gonna. Come up here.

580
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,920
Come up here.

581
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,221
Oh.

582
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:44,990
I want to come with you inside me.

583
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:47,092
- Whenever you're ready, okay?
- Oh, okay.

584
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:50,395
- I'll do that.

585
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,283
<i>Good morning.</i>

586
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,806
<i>Good morning.</i>

587
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:04,442
<i>God bless CPAC.</i>

588
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,513
<i>We are at the edge of a cliff.</i>

589
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:12,917
- <i>Liberty is under assault.</i>

590
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:14,753
Why are you watching this crap?

591
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:16,421
To not get a boner.

592
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:17,822
Is it working?

593
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:20,258
So far.

594
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:22,327
Is your penis doing okay?

595
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:24,462
It's all right.

596
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:26,031
<i>Each and every one of you</i>

597
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,432
<i>is gonna be audited by the IRS.</i>

598
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:30,268
All right, I'm gonna go take a shower.

599
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:31,636
No, you're not.

600
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:32,871
Huh?

601
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:35,073
Go take a look for yourself.

602
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,480
- Frank?
- I assume so.

603
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:45,050
- The other side, too?
- Yep.

604
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:46,985
<i>During the Super Bowl,</i>

605
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,354
<i>there's not a smidgen of
corruption with the IRS...</i>

606
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,059
- Hey, V.
- Hey.

607
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:57,729
Hey, can I get a beer and a water?

608
00:28:57,764 --> 00:28:59,064
Thank you.

609
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:04,469
Starting to remind me of him.

610
00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:05,804
Lip!

611
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,672
Hey, buddy, hey.

612
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,085
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Going on?

613
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,076
Don't be talking to strangers, son.

614
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:13,011
Frank, Liam can't be in here.

615
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:14,646
Drinking age in my country is four...

616
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,047
and a half.

617
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,694
That half really makes a difference.

618
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,384
Fine, he can stay.

619
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:22,087
But no booze, and we
charge the same for sodas

620
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,355
Ah, extra...

621
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,490
- For sodas.
- Oh.

622
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:28,059
Don't be corrupting my
son with your interracial,

623
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,994
bisexual funny business.

624
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,207
What do you want, Frank?

625
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:32,764
Two Cokes.

626
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,744
Never thought I'd hear
that come out of your mouth.

627
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:36,935
Well, being a good role
model for my progeny

628
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,837
is an important job, Kermit,

629
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:41,873
unlike the bad influences
he's had up to this point.

630
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:44,075
Hey, buddy, hi. You doing okay?

631
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:46,845
- I'm having fun with Frank.
- Well, of course you are.

632
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,758
Well, if you need anything,
you know how to call, yeah?

633
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:50,115
Mm-hmm.

634
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,549
All right.

635
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,061
Hey, want to have some real fun tonight?

636
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:04,863
What do you say you and me

637
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:08,266
get some female company for tonight?

638
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:10,368
You can have your pick of the litter.

639
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:14,639
Now, the important
criteria to look for is who's DTF,

640
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:17,442
who's holding weed or coke,

641
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:21,079
and who makes your wee-wee tingle.

642
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:22,914
Now go get the one you want.

643
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:36,161
Oh, it's a tiny dude!

644
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,263
- Whoa!

645
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:41,433
I've got a date.

646
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:43,668
- A lovely choice.

647
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:45,637
- Hello.
- Hello.

648
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:47,672
Care to join us, Dollface?

649
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,240
Sure.

650
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,309
<i>Dude, it's really not that bad.</i>

651
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:52,510
How do you deal with it...

652
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,813
The taste and the folds

653
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,247
and the slime?

654
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:57,849
What, uh, cheese dick and a throat

655
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,117
full of spooge, that's better?

656
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,519
Give me a beer.

657
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:05,089
God!

658
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,158
Man, if I sucked some guy's dick,

659
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,205
I wouldn't be half as
dramatic as you're being right now.

660
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:10,995
You're a better man than I.

661
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,363
You at least feel more worldly?

662
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,132
Not at all.

663
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,301
I think it had steam coming off of it.

664
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,136
Should I just get you the Drano, then?

665
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,171
If I knew I could gargle
it, dude, without dying,

666
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:21,206
I'd say yes.

667
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:23,775
You are 100% gay.

668
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,443
I have PTSD.

669
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:32,116
It's all over my boobs, too.

670
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,952
What the hell happened here?

671
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,320
Did we get robbed?

672
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,321
- Kev.
- Wake up.

673
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:37,622
Hey.

674
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:39,023
Oh.

675
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,025
Hey, sexy. Hey, beautiful.

676
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:43,528
- What is going on?
- This place is a disaster.

677
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:44,963
You were supposed to clean today.

678
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:46,831
Oh, sorry, I know.

679
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,534
I got too busy, but we had a great day.

680
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,035
Oh, my... Did you know Gemma

681
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:52,804
can climb up on the
couch all by herself?

682
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,506
Your only job was to clean today.

683
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:58,076
Really? I thought I was
supposed to keep the kids alive, too.

684
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,245
We were at work all
day, busting our butts.

685
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,580
Yeah, all we ask is to come
home to a clean house.

686
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,215
I was working all day, too.

687
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:05,683
Doing what, having a food fight?

688
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,552
- Did you even shower?
- Make us dinner?

689
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:10,221
Oh, my God, I'm not a maid. Why
are you two riding my ass?

690
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:13,758
Because you sat on that
ass all day doing nothing.

691
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:15,860
Oh, that's exactly what I did today.

692
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,729
Nothing.

693
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:21,966
I did a heaping shit
pile of absolutely nothing!

694
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:29,040
- Uh, $328...
- Are you kidding...

695
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:30,453
- No, wait, no, no!

696
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:31,876
Come on, not the front door.

697
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:33,444
We have a special entrance.

698
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,748
Whoa!

699
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,116
Got a plan?

700
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,184
Yeah, of course there's a plan.

701
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,419
Oh, shit.

702
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,855
- Let's just...
- Okay.

703
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:50,128
- Ladies first.
- Okay. Oh, boy.

704
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:51,930
- I'll give you a boost.
- Okay.

705
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,232
- Liam, come on.
- Okay.

706
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:56,601
- Don't fall, okay?
- Okay.

707
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:58,536
Are you sure this thing is safe?

708
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:00,705
- Well, we'll find out soon.
- Okay.

709
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,140
Liam, grab my ankles.

710
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,312
Okay. Oh, yeah. Thank you.

711
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:09,747
Jesus.

712
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,083
Whoa.

713
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:14,285
Frank, I'm sorry.

714
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:29,000
Holy shit.

715
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:30,902
I had no idea our floor was so slanted.

716
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,937
Ugh, it'd be nice to have a toothbrush

717
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,505
and a change of clothes.

718
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,174
Yeah, I need a shower.

719
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,943
My ass is numb from this chair.

720
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:41,312
This couch is pretty comfy.

721
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:43,314
Still not mad at Frank, huh?

722
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,351
I refuse to let him
have any of my energy.

723
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:50,521
- Dibs on the kitchen bathroom!
- Oh!

724
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:52,423
Oh, shit, you...

725
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,861
- Shit!

726
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,162
We got to get upstairs.

727
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:59,931
Yeah, we can throw a stink bomb up there

728
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:00,999
if Liam weren't with him.

729
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,667
Put bars up on the window.

730
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,469
<i>Do you guys
think we can set fire</i>

731
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,537
<i>to the top floor of the house?</i>

732
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:09,574
- Hurry up in there!
- I'm using the sink.

733
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:18,416
Holy shit.

734
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:20,385
Dude, that is a mangled mess.

735
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,886
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh, fuck.

736
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,855
It's all bloody and raw, man.

737
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,002
You shouldn't have gotten that
stupid circumcision, man.

738
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,403
All right, well, I
did, and there's nothing

739
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,961
I can do about it now, so fuck you guys.

740
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:32,308
I already feel like enough of
a freak being the only Gallagher

741
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:33,998
who's not circumcised.

742
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:37,035
Thanks for making
me feel worse about it.

743
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:43,074
What the hell?

744
00:34:52,285 --> 00:34:53,518
Hey, kids.

745
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,219
See those ladies over there?

746
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:56,921
They're gonna help us clean the house

747
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,990
so we can spend more
time playing together.

748
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:02,927
Eh, what the hell?

749
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,433
Yeah.

750
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:12,236
Main's off, and
the outside spigot's open.

751
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:14,072
All right, hand me the hacksaw.

752
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:15,173
Thanks.

753
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,711
Let's see how long he
lasts up there without water.

754
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,285
This is so fun, Harry.

755
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,954
We have such a great life now.

756
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,924
Double stroller?

757
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,460
We could get a lot for that.

758
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,916
Pretty soon we'll be able to
start saving up for college.

759
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,806
- Oh, no, it's okay.

760
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:54,153
You don't have to go to
college if you don't want to, Harry.

761
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:00,815
Shit!

762
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:28,943
That smell could knock a
buzzard off a gut wagon.

763
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:35,050
Hey, Dollface, we got to hose you down.

764
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:38,620
You're riper than a fat
boy in a clown costume.

765
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,455
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

766
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,791
Liam...

767
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,659
coffee on the hot plate.

768
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,974
Oh, God damn it. I...

769
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,483
I hope it was recently flushed.

770
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,689
Two raptors circling the nest.

771
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:31,940
Nest is secured.

772
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:00,768
What's in the box?

773
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:04,038
New uniforms.

774
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,941
- Oh, those are so cute!
- Oh, hell, no.

775
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:09,210
- I am not exposing my legs.
- Oh, come on.

776
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,545
You'll make more tips.

777
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,981
Nobody sees my spider
veins except my gyno

778
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:14,649
and the neighbor with the binoculars.

779
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:17,185
Don't have to work here anymore.

780
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,187
Fine.

781
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:21,456
Bunch of us are going to
Melody Lounge after work.

782
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,957
- You should come.
- Is that a club?

783
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:24,192
It'll be fun.

784
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:25,827
I don't have a change of clothes.

785
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:28,029
- Of course you do.
- Yeah, right.

786
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,198
Come on, you look fine.

787
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,100
Hey, bring Lip, too.

788
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:50,485
You know, the Feds showed
up at my internship today.

789
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,054
Yeah, took a couple of servers.

790
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,322
What for?

791
00:38:54,357 --> 00:38:56,090
No idea.

792
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,226
But those nerds are richer than balls.

793
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,864
I texted Caleb.

794
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:05,533
Told him to meet me at
the loft after work.

795
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:07,068
Gonna compare vagina stories?

796
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,103
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

797
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,572
There's Carl.

798
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,912
<i>Carl Gallagher, please
approach the ambulance.</i>

799
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,181
<i>Gonna need you to speed up, Carl.</i>

800
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,121
I'm coming!

801
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,623
- Shh!

802
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,758
Gonna wake up the damn babies.

803
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,097
You must be from the
topless-maid company.

804
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:37,432
You're quick.

805
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,634
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

806
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,402
Yes.

807
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:43,104
Let me show you around.

808
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,807
As you can see, the place is a mess.

809
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,809
I'm gonna need you to do the laundry,

810
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,577
wash the dishes,

811
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:52,080
clean the floors,
vacuum, and dust the furniture.

812
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:53,815
Sound good? Okay!

813
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,550
Wow. Sorry.

814
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:57,151
This is happening.

815
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:00,488
Those are spectacular.

816
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,068
It's amazing how you
stuffed them in there

817
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,569
and now they're out in all their glory.

818
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:06,127
Hallelujah.

819
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,963
What's happening to me?

820
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,399
We gave you a jumbo dose of Thorazine.

821
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,735
My brain feels like cotton candy.

822
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,404
And that's the way you're
gonna feel for the next 72 hours.

823
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:19,107
No way you get a boner on that shit.

824
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,609
Don't have to think about
hairy balls anymore.

825
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,177
What?

826
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:27,582
You guys are the best.

827
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:36,991
Wendy, don't get me wrong.

828
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:38,793
I like what's going on here,

829
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:40,862
but are you gonna be
doing any cleaning today?

830
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,530
Cleaning?

831
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,432
You didn't bring any Lysol

832
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:47,368
or... or ammonia or a mop or anything.

833
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:52,140
You thought a topless maid service
actually did cleaning?

834
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:54,142
Yes.

835
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:55,777
That's cute.

836
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:57,312
Here.

837
00:40:57,347 --> 00:41:00,315
My services are Ã  la
carte. Pick what you like.

838
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,884
- Mop and glow.
- That's one of my specialties.

839
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,619
I'm sure it is.

840
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,854
- Pipe cleaning.
- Old dudes like that one.

841
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,524
Brazilian floor wax.

842
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,025
That's not what you think it is.

843
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:15,830
I have no idea what I think that is.

844
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:18,433
Sham wow?

845
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,838
Hey, you finally
decided to come home.

846
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:26,474
Did you trick me into
having sex with a woman?

847
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:28,009
What?

848
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:30,244
So that you wouldn't feel
bad about what you did?

849
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,913
Look, what are you talking about?

850
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,382
You made me feel like a
freak 'cause I'm only gay.

851
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,317
How you feel is on you.

852
00:41:36,353 --> 00:41:39,887
I slept with some random
chick 'cause of you.

853
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:41,589
I didn't force you to do anything.

854
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,725
I can still taste her
hairspray and her pubes

855
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,526
and her vagisitis.

856
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:47,528
You obviously picked the wrong woman.

857
00:41:47,564 --> 00:41:48,830
Don't turn this around on me.

858
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:50,531
You're the weirdo, all right? Not me.

859
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,700
Because I like to have sex
with women once in a while?

860
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:54,502
- It's not normal.
- It's very normal.

861
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:56,904
Not if you're gay, it's
not. It's disgusting.

862
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,173
Then don't do it anymore.

863
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:01,509
And it's a turnoff.

864
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:03,611
Me? I'm the turnoff?

865
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,179
You sleep with women...

866
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:06,414
yeah.

867
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:08,216
Then why are we even going out?

868
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,388
I keep asking myself the same thing.

869
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:15,123
- Judgmental much?
- Vagina-fucker much?

870
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,958
When did you become such a baby?

871
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,093
When did you become such a bisexual?

872
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:23,765
So that's it, then.

873
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:31,606
Yeah, I guess so.

874
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,778
- Have a nice life.
- Already am.

875
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,751
Kevin, what are you doing?

876
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:46,254
I got a great idea for a business.

877
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:48,222
- Where are babies?
- Sleeping.

878
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,824
- Monitor.
- Is the house clean?

879
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,093
That is a great question,
which is directly related

880
00:42:52,128 --> 00:42:53,327
to my new business plan.

881
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,563
- So, no?
- You are correct.

882
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:58,633
The topless maid that I
hired was more of an escort...

883
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:01,238
- You hired a topless maid?
- Did you have sex with her?

884
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,136
Of course not.

885
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:04,316
What else did you think a
topless-maid service did, Kev?

886
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,407
I was focused on the maid part

887
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:08,976
and not the topless
part, which gave me this idea.

888
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,449
- Nooks and Fannies?
- Yes.

889
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:16,284
We are gonna start a maid service

890
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,419
that is not only topless

891
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:20,521
but also cleans; we'll
corner the market.

892
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,623
You expect me to
clean someone else's house?

893
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:24,292
Don't have to. That's the genius part.

894
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,794
You two are the boobs of the operation.

895
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,296
She's gonna do the cleaning.

896
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:42,176
I think these girls just invited me

897
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:43,544
so I'd bring you.

898
00:43:45,882 --> 00:43:47,515
Hey!

899
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,983
Oh. He's... he's cute.

900
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:50,818
Wait, wait, wait. Stop,
stop, stop, stop.

901
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:52,453
- Hi, Lip.
- Hey, hi.

902
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:54,021
Hi.

903
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:55,389
What are you drinking?

904
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,791
Uh, beer.

905
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:58,459
Okay. You want something, girl?

906
00:43:58,495 --> 00:44:01,629
Uh, a change of
clothes. You guys look great.

907
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,165
Have a shot. It'll make you feel sexier.

908
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,469
Uh, two Stellas and three
shots of Jager, on my tab.

909
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:11,339
I saw you checking me
out during my interview.

910
00:44:11,374 --> 00:44:12,740
That obvious?

911
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,075
But I liked it.

912
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,212
- Oh.
- Thanks.

913
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:19,514
Cheers, boss.

914
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:20,882
Thanks.

915
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,350
Cheers.

916
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:26,654
Ugh!

917
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:28,055
- Let's dance.
- Yeah.

918
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,063
Just so you know...

919
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:38,065
I have a kid and a stupid ex-boyfriend,

920
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,867
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

921
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,436
Yeah, well, uh, I just
got expelled from college

922
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,072
and did 30 days in rehab, so...

923
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:47,074
Then we're a perfect match.

924
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,481
- Hey.
- Yeah.

925
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:58,219
Is that Ariel's boyfriend?

926
00:44:58,254 --> 00:45:00,588
No. She just met him on Tinder.

927
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:02,390
Going to the bathroom to bang.

928
00:45:02,425 --> 00:45:03,691
- You on Tinder?

929
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:05,092
- Uh-uh.
- Mm.

930
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:07,261
Not into the meaningless, random hookup?

931
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:09,096
Uh, no, I'm more of a

932
00:45:09,132 --> 00:45:12,099
"one dysfunctional
relationship into another" kind of girl.

933
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,268
- I'm taking a break.
- This is why you need Tinder.

934
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:16,103
Give me your phone.

935
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,106
You're a hot piece of ass.

936
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:21,108
You should be boning on the regs.

937
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:23,244
- Let's get you a picture.
- I don't know.

938
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,315
They always seem to get attached.

939
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,216
Or maybe that's me.

940
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:30,818
You bragging about your golden vagina?

941
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,221
No, more like my golden
ability to pick liars.

942
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:37,725
Then don't talk to
them. Just swipe, fuck, leave.

943
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,993
Ooh.

944
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,428
You already have three matches.

945
00:45:40,463 --> 00:45:42,496
And Luke is at the
bar across the street,

946
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,965
ready to rumble.

947
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:46,300
Mm-hmm.

948
00:45:46,336 --> 00:45:48,002
Oh.

949
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:01,349
What the fuck?

950
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,150
Everybody, wake up.

951
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:04,685
- What's going on?
- That!

952
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,687
No! Oh. Oh!

953
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,256
Oh, shit! Fuck.

954
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,326
Don't say Papa never gave you a pet.

955
00:46:13,997 --> 00:46:16,697
- Hey.

956
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,532
Ugh!

957
00:46:19,836 --> 00:46:21,969
V!

958
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:25,773
V! Where are you?

959
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:27,508
- Ah, V!

960
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:29,844
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing?

961
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:31,979
- Can V come out and play?
- It's 2 a.m.

962
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:33,981
My kids, my husband and
wife are sleeping.

963
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:38,152
You know that that sounds weird, right?

964
00:46:38,187 --> 00:46:39,186
You're drunk.

965
00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:40,454
And fucked.

966
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,990
I just Tinder-fucked... this guy.

967
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:46,794
His name is, like, a J or
an L or some other letter.

968
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:48,162
I don't care.

969
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:50,131
Careless, mindless sex has set me free.

970
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,377
Tell me more about it tomorrow.

971
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:54,201
This guy was doing this...

972
00:46:54,237 --> 00:46:56,237
What the fuck?

973
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:00,608
Did you just close the door in my face?

974
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,586
- I found a pickax.
- What the hell you doing?

975
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,555
- Looking for demolition tools.
- Fiona?

976
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,358
- There's a shovel in here.
- She's asleep.

977
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,829
It's me!

978
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:25,399
Hey, I brought you some coffee.
I figured you might be hungover.

979
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:28,035
I am. What time is it?

980
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:31,605
Not as early as you
ringing my doorbell last night.

981
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,507
- Huh?
- Don't "huh" me.

982
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:37,478
- Yo, Fi.
- Huh?

983
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:39,346
Pickax, sledgehammer.

984
00:47:39,382 --> 00:47:41,382
Sledgehammer.

985
00:47:43,086 --> 00:47:44,285
I'll see you upstairs.

986
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,254
I'll be up in a minute.

987
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,689
We're getting rid of Frank.

988
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:53,461
Ow.

989
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,863
Who was this random guy you
hooked up with last night?

990
00:47:55,898 --> 00:47:58,432
Key word in that sentence is "random."

991
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,267
I don't know.

992
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:03,037
Why you sleeping with
random dudes, anyway?

993
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:05,706
Why am I not hooking
up with random dudes?

994
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:08,075
Some sort of rebound thing from Sean?

995
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,314
I'd have to care for it to
be a Sean-rebound thing.

996
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,583
Funny. You said the
same thing about Frank.

997
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:18,652
Ooh. Having a rebound thing with Frank?

998
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,955
No, dummy. Caring.

999
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,658
You seriously think that I
give a fuck about Sean or Frank?

1000
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:27,294
It's been weeks, and
you haven't talked at all

1001
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,163
about what happened on your wedding day.

1002
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,466
'Cause there's nothing to talk about...

1003
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:34,902
so I'm not gonna talk about it...

1004
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:37,171
ever.

1005
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,650
Look, it's harder than I thought.

1006
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:11,172
- What the fuck?

1007
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,615
Aah!

1008
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:30,291
Five, four, three, two, one.

1009
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:35,963
Okay, well, the 72 hours is up.
