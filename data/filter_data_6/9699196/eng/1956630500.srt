172
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,680
Okay, fine. Please will you come back?
But you can't go rogue, okay?

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,840
[phone ringing]

174
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Jean speaking.

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,960
<i>Hello, Jean.
It's Michelle Lawson, Remi's agent.</i>

176
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,560
<i>- Long time no speak.</i>
- Hello, Michelle.

177
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
<i>I'm calling because
Remi mentioned the possibility</i>

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
<i>of you two writing together again.</i>

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,680
<i>Something about teenagers
and sex education in schools?</i>

180
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>Sounds fascinating.</i>

181
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,280
Well, firstly, my research is confidential
and secondly, Remi is grossly mistaken.

182
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,520
I will not be writing with him again.

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
<i>Oh, why not?</i>

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,200
Because he is a colossal twat.

185
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,000
[knocking at door]

186
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
- Oh, hello, Ola.
- Hi.

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,840
Have a seat.

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
So, Dad told me
you guys aren't seeing each other anymore.

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
Well, at least...

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,640
it might make it easier
for you and Otis now.

191
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,640
Oh, we broke up too.

192
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

193
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,960
He didn't tell you?

194
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,680
Well, he doesn't tell me much
these days, and...

195
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, sometimes I wonder if
it would've been easier if I'd had a girl.

196
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Girls can be pretty annoying too.

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
[sighs]

198
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
You know, if you ever need
to talk to a woman about anything...

199
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
[sighs]

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,800
What would you do
if you really liked someone,

201
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,920
and you were so sure they liked you too,

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
but all of a sudden they're acting like
they find you completely revolting?

203
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Douching is not essential

204
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,520
if you eat a lot of fiber
and empty your bowels regularly.

205
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,120
- Huh.
- Hmm.

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
If you've never douched before,
it might be best

207
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,960
to start with a simple bulb, like that.

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
So, water in the bulb...
[Rahim continues]

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,040
If I'm not cooking a roast chicken,
what are people going to eat?

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
Crisps.

211
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Otis, just crisps.

212
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
...for as long as you can,
sit on the toilet...

213
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,000
and release.

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,000
- What about dips?
- No dips.

215
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
- But my guac is...
- Just listen to Rahim.

216
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,880
...and protective mucus in your anus.

217
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
- Boys!
- Hey!

218
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760
Let's see the hand.

219
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,640
- Glad to have you back, Marchetti.
- Cheers, man.

220
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
Sir,

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
my cast came off this morning
and I'm back training this week.

222
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
Amazing news. Congratulations.

223
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,400
So, I'm not gonna be able
to make dress rehearsals tomorrow night.

224
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,520
Jackson, this is show business, all right?

225
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
Not no-show business.
Just rearrange training.

226
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,040
It's my mum, sir. She wants me
back in the pool as soon as possible.

227
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm sure she'll understand.
It's great to have more than one passion.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
Talk to her, okay?

229
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,320
[Rahim] Squat, don't rush,
push it in, compress the bulb.

230
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
- [door opens]
- Pull to take it out.

231
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
What's going on?

232
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm teaching Otis how to douche.

233
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,640
- But we're leaving, actually.
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

234
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
[Mr. Hendricks] Okay. [laughs]

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,160
Thank you.

236
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,960
Squeeze, hold, release.

237
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
- I'll pick you up at your house.
- I can meet you at the party.

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,200
- Small gathering.
- Yeah, but I wanna see where you live.

239
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
Okay. [chuckles]

240
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
What's the matter?

241
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,040
I've just never had anyone
meet my family before.

242
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,920
I still think that you should invite her.

243
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
No.

244
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,080
- What...
- No. I'll see you later.

245
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't want to see any roast chicken!

246
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey, Maeve. [chuckles]

247
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,520
Um, I think you should come
to Otis's party tonight.

248
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,560
- I didn't get an invite.
- But I know he wants you there.

249
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,800
- [sighs]
- I think that you two really need to talk.

250
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,360
He didn't mean what he said in the text.

251
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Please? Just talk to him.

252
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll think about it, okay?

253
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
Okay.

254
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,520
[sighs]

255
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
See you later. Bye.

256
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
[whispering] Okay.

257
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
What are you...

258
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,840
Okay, what are you doing, Mum?
What are you doing?

259
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
[normal] Ooh!

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,320
- Otis.
- Mum.

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just, uh...

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,960
- I was waiting for you to get back.
- Oh.

263
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm thinking of having
some friends over tonight.

264
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
Oh.

265
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,920
- A party?
- No.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Just a gathering.

267
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,680
Um... But I was thinking
maybe if you could not be there?

268
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
Oh. Oh, I see. Uh, yeah.

269
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
It's not personal.

270
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
- No.
- It's just...

271
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
- Of course not.
- You know?

272
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
You're asserting your independence
from your primary care giver.

273
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
It's perfectly normal.

274
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,240
I will make myself scarce.

275
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,880
- Otis?
- Yeah?

276
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,520
You know you can talk to me
about anything?

Eric, why didn't you say
you had a boyfriend?

according to the Department of Health,

325
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,400
what is the most common drug
used in the UK?

326
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,080
- [buzz]
- Ibuprofen.

327
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,120
- Incorrect.
- [groans]

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,120

I think it's marijuana.

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
It's not a legal drug.
It's paracetamol, trust me.

332
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,080
[coughs] Weed.

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,840
The answer is...

334
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
paracetamol.

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,880
When the others arrive,
I'll put out the rest of the snacks.

343
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,600
Maybe we can play some charades.

344
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,560
So, did Eric invite you?

345
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,800
I heard there was a big party
at your house.

346
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,240
I thought I might get to hang out
with your mum.

347
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Oh, God.

348
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,320
[sighs]

349
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
[doorbell chimes]

350
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,040
That must be Eric.

351
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
I told him to bring a cheese board.

352
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,440
[sniffs]

353
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,240
- [Otis] Hi, Debbie. Hi.
- You all right?

354
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,200
[Otis] Oh, yeah. Okay, um...

355
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Oh, um...

356
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
Excuse me, um...

357
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,360
What? Oh, God!

358
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,480
[woman] I can't believe it.

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
[woman 2] Who's gonna be there?

360
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,640
[woman] Well, I hope Jamie and Joel.

361
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
[laughing]

362
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,600
- Who even told you about Otis's party?
- Trom-boner.

363
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,680
[scanner beeps]

364
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,720
Adam?

365
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,640
Didn't you get expelled?

366
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,120
[whispering] I heard he has a huge dick.

367
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
[normal] Thanks, Adam.

368
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,280
[girls laughing]

369
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,560
[door opens, closes]

370
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,840
[door opens]

371
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,320
- Hi, my babies.
- Hi, Mum.

372
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,880
You been crying?

373
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,840
Huh?

374
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
Allergies. [chuckles]

375
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,640
These bloody plants
are trying to kill me, I think.

376
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,600
Good job they're pretty, eh?

377
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
How was school?

378
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
I got back on the quiz team.
And we're going to the finals.

379
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Oh.

380
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,520
[clears throat]
And I have two tickets for family.

381
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,440
And it would mean a lot
if you could be there.

382
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,520
- Yeah, of course I'll be there.
- Cool.

383
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
Why are you all dressed up?

384
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm going to a party.

385
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Who's the boy then?

386
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
No, there's no boy, Mum.

387
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,800
- I'll see you later.
- What's his name?

388
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,840
Stop it! There's no boy.

389
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
- Bye, Els.
- [kissing] Mmm.

390
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,200
[chuckling] Stop!

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,840
Bye.

392
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,520
- I thought you were busy tonight.
- I am.

393
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,040
- I'm going to a party.
- Can I come?

394
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,040
No.

395
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You don't know what you're missing.
I'm really fun at parties,

396
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
people can't get enough of me.

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,080
- I thought we were friends now.
- What?

398
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
What made you think that?

399
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm not spending another night
stuck inside with my brother.

400
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,040
Seriously,
my brain's a precious commodity,

401
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
and it's slowly dying from boredom.

402
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't let it die, Maeve.

403
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Please? Please?

404
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, my God. Okay, fine!

405
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,400
- Do I have time to change my shirt?
- No.

406
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,920
Also, all of our brains are slowly dying.
You're not unique.

407
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh, my goodness.
I'm terrible at making decisions.

408
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,400
I usually just have what Michael's having.

409
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,640
[chuckles] I mean,

410
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I used to have what Michael was having.

411
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,680
Well, do what I do sometimes:
close your eyes and point.

412
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,880
- [laughs] Okay.
- It works.

413
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,920
What can I get you?

414
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'll have a three-legged monkey, please.

415
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
- [laughs]
- [Maureen] Oh!

416
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,120
- And you?
- I'll have one of those too.

417
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
- [Jean] Thank you.
- [chuckles]

418
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, being on your own
will get easier, I promise.

419
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Before you know it, you'll be wondering
how you ever shared the TV remote.

420
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
I hope so.

421
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
How's your... man friend?

422
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,200
Um... we split up, actually.

423
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

424
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
[sighs]

425
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,040
I think I realized I'd become
too independent for relationships.

426
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Hmm.

427
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,200
I sometimes get worried
that I'm going to end up

428
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,600
- like my poor old Auntie Gladys.
- What happened to her?

429
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,920
She choked to death on a microwave dinner.

430
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,440
- What?
- Nobody found her for two weeks.

431
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,400
[gasps] Really?

432
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
[laughing]

433
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

434
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,560
Well, here's to Auntie Gladys then.

435
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,800
To Auntie Gladys.

436
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,760

440
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

441
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,160
- Eric? Hi! I am going to kill you.
- Hey.

442
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,080
Why? I didn't invite this many people.

443
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,360
- Is Ola here?
- Why would Ola be here?

444
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,720
- We have broken up.
- Okay. I thought the whole point of this

445
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,560
was for you to show Ola that you're chill.

446
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,680
- Should I get you both drinks?
- Yeah.

447
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah, Otis needs a drink. Okay, dude.
Dude...

448
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
this is the closest to cool in sixth form
you're ever gonna get.

449
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
Enjoy it, okay?

450
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,680
En-joy-ment.

451
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,960
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

452
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,240
Chin-chin.

453
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Ooh.

454
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

455
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,880
[exhales nervously]

456
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
[Isaac] Well,

457
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,560
this isn't exactly disability-friendly,
is it?

458
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,400
- Yeah, well you wanted to come.
- And you didn't think about these stairs

459
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,160
versus wheelchair situation.

460
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,120
- Let's just go home.
- I'm not going home.

462
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm here to par-tay.

463
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,480
But that does mean you're gonna
have to carry me down these stairs.

464
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,800
- Are you joking?
- Does it look like I'm joking?

465
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
Hello, kind sir.

466
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,160
Would you be so generous as to escort me

467
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,680
and my chair down these ridiculous steps?

468
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,720
- I just had a cast taken off, so I can't.
- No, it's fine.

469
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,880
[Isaac]
I'm sensing a hint of tension here.

470
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
Did you guys used to go out or something?

471
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,280
- So, who broke whose heart?
- Shut up, Isaac.

472
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,560
Boys.

473
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,640
- Could you give us a hand getting...
- Isaac.

474
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,240
- ...Isaac a lift downstairs, please?
- Sure.

475
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,480
- Enjoy the party, Isaac.
- Grab a corner, boys. One, two...

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,880
So, I'm assuming it was you
who was the breaker of hearts then.

477
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Okay, we're done here.

478
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,360
Hey, Jackson! Are you looking forward
to the dress rehearsal tomorrow?

479
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,280
- Oh, man. You...
- Mate,

480
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,160
he's not doing that gay Shakespeare shit.

481
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,720
Look, he's back in the pool.

482
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
Ruby is looking banging tonight.

483
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,600
You could never.

484
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
Fuck off, Marchetti.

485
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,720
[Viv] Dex is here.

486
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,280
- Um, hi.
- I don't have time for "hi".

487
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,400
I know I need to go talk to him,
but I don't know how.

488
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Well, just go up to him and say,
"Hey, Dex," and ask him about his day

489
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,880
or a game that he likes

490
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
or another nerdy-type thing
you lot like talking about.

491
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Then you keep chatting
and see where the night takes you. Easy.

492
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,120
Be yourself, all right?
And you'll be fine.

493
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,800
I just realized that your cast is gone.
That's great news.

494
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Yeah, back to prison for me.

495
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm joking. Go and get your man.

496
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,280
- Is that Maeve? Why is Maeve here?
- I kind of invited her.

497
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,720
- What?
- You guys need to talk.

498
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm not talking to her.
She can talk to me.

499
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,280
Who is that guy?

500
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,840
- No idea.
- This isn't really my scene, to be honest.

501
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
What's your scene then?

502
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,480
Uh... I don't know.
Reading a book somewhere alone.

503
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,560
People need people.

504
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,200
Is that another NA motivational quote
by any chance?

505
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,840
No, more of a core value, actually.

506
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,800
Who's the intense starey guy?

507
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,640
That's Otis.

508
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,800
It's his party. Things are a bit weird
between us right now.

509
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,680
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

510
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,160
But you wanted him to be your boyfriend?

511
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,160
- You're not actually psychic, you know.
- But I'm pretty close, right?

512
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,440

It's really awkward, but I've been told

Why can't you talk to your boyfriend
about this?

Look, I'm ready to lose my virginity,

Wait!

705
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,400
You stopped coming to the window.

706
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,920
Yeah, I did.

707

What did I do wrong?

708
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,600
You bullied me for years, Adam.

709
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,280
You made me feel unsafe for years.

710
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,200
You were one of the main reasons
I wasn't kind to myself.

711
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,160
And I'm supposed to believe
that you've suddenly changed?

712

You can't even hold my hand.

You invited her but not me.

729

No, I didn't invite her. Eric invited her
without my knowledge.

730

I didn't want her here at all.

Can we turn the music down?
Um, I wanna say something...

740

- [music quietens]
- to my party guests.

741
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Um, so, this is Ola.

742
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't know if you know her.
She's well, quite little and...

743
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,120
and funny, and interesting, and pretty,
and she was my girlfriend

744
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,280
until she told me
I can't see Maeve anymore.

745
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,960
Now, we all know Maeve. Scary Maeve.

746
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,800
You know, she's not actually scary.
She's just pretending.

747
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,360
- Anyway...
- [laughs]

748
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,000
Maeve told me that she liked me, okay?

749
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,600
And I like Maeve.

750
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,960
I like Maeve a lot,
a lot more than I liked Ola.

751
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,600
- Otis. Otis, get off...
- But I was trying to be a good boyfriend,

752
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,480
so I said to Maeve,
"Sorry, I can't see you anymore."

753
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,240
And then, Ola dumped me.

754
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah, it's confusing. I was confused.

755
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,720
But I thought probably a good thing

756
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,600
'cause I just really wanted to be
with Maeve.

757
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,840
And I didn't really want to be with Ola,
and then I realized

758
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,560
Maeve Wiley just likes playing
with people's feelings,

759
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,040
and she doesn't care
about anyone else.

760
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,840
Like, she brought this... man with her.

761
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I don't know, probably just here
to make me jealous.

762
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,640
- Definitely didn't work.
- [whispers] It definitely did.

763
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
[Otis] All in all,

764
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,360
I think she's probably
the most selfish person I've ever met.

765
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,360
And I think it's good
that I'm not going out with either of them

766
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,360
because I think I deserve
a whole lot more.

767
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,080
Thank you for coming. Good night.

768
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,160

- Um... Yeah, I was ten.
- Mm-hmm.

831
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,360
Joe and I
were still living with our parents.

832
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,160
They would send us out
so they could get high.

833
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,480
Anyway, on this particular day,
I dared Joe to climb up this massive tree,

834
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,320
and he chickened out halfway up.

835
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,680
So, of course,
I wanted to prove that I was braver

836
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
and get all the way up to the top,

837
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,560
which I did.

838
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,320
And then I fell.

839
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,520
That's it. That's the story.

840
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,320
Do you blame your parents?

841
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
No.

842
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,160
I sometimes blame them for not sticking
with the parenting thing, though.

843
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,120
Yeah, that bit kind of sucked.

844

Okay, well, I've got one for you.

00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,800
My mum didn't take me to school.
She used to sleep a lot back then.

847
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,120
I tried to make myself beans on toast.

848
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
My brother had to call an ambulance.

849
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,440

860
