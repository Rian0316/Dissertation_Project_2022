00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,036
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:04,709
<i>While Ian's wife Jane
was in a coma...</i>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,455
Do we have a deal?

4
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,829
<i>Susan got an ultimatum.</i>

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,017
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

6
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,657
Mike's new hero...

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,292
Owe you one.

8
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,371
After those mutts knocked you around
the other day, your boy paid 'em off.

9
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,048
...had a secret agenda

10
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:20,274
Gabrielle.

11
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,507
<i>Gabrielle learned the identity...</i>

12
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:24,671
I’m rich now. I can give you
anything you want.

13
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,404
<i>...of her secret admirer.</i>

14
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:27,516
Tell me everything.

15
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:32,137
<i>and Orson's mother shared some
family secrets that Bree...</o></i>

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,339
<i>...would later discover.</i>

17
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:43,599
<i>If there was one thing Orson Hodge
understood, it was teeth.</i>

18
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,862
<i>that's why people stopped him
at barbecues...</i>

19
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,472
<i>during cocktail parties...</i>

20
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,492
<i>and in the occasional men's room.</i>

21
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,267
<i>Yes, when it came to teeth,</i>

22
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:06,584
<i>people expected Dr. Hodge
to have all the answers.</i>

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,970
<i>sadly for Orson,
this was not always the case.</i>

24
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,918
Well, it does look  a little fishy.

25
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,918
Fishy?

26
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,967
It couldn't be more obvious.

27
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,035
Alma killed Monique.

28
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,458
That's why she disappeared.

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,580
And I bet she pulled the teeth so people
would suspect her dentist husband.

30
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,824
Well, why would she keep them?

31
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,812
Who knows ? She's probably gonna sneak
in and plant them in our house.

32
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,788
Well, we've saved her the trouble,
haven't we? Is it a full set?

33
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:37,223
- Orson! Not on the duvet!
- Oh, it's okay. They won't stain.

34
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:39,427
I don't care! I am not sleeping
in a bed

35
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,613
that had your dead
mistress' teeth in it!

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,691
Let's just take them to the police.

37
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:48,418
And say what? We can't prove
these came from Alma's.

38
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,536
She'll deny ever having seen. And don't
forget, I’m the one they suspect.

39
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,097
Well, we have to do something.

40
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:56,292
I agree, but not until we put
this back in her house.

41
00:01:57,524 --> 00:01:58,861
And then we'll call the police.

42
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:01,446
Trust me, she'll never get away with it.

43
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,663
Hello.

44
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,590
You've been very naughty, haven't you?

45
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:22,561
Orson? Is that you?

46
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,915
I know what you and alma are
up to, and it's gonna stop.

47
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,519
<i>Yes, Orson was an expert on teeth.</i>

48
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:33,057
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

49
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,760
oh, I think you do.

50
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:40,853
<i>That's how he could tell when
people were lying through them.</i>

Desperate Housewives - Saison 3
Episode no 13 "Come Play With Me"

54
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,951
It can happen so quickly.

55
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,780
<i>In the moment it takes a gunman's bullet
to enter his victim's leg...</i>

56
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:36,360
<i>in the time it takes to tell a wife her
husband won't be home for dinner...</i>

57
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:42,348
<i>in the instant it takes a father to meet
his son for the very first time...</i>

58
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:49,360
<i>yes, life as we know it can change...</i>

59
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,668
<i>in a heartbeat.</i>

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
Jane's still
running a fever.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Yes,
and she hasn't responded

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,500
To any of the meds
that we've tried.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,600
Do you think
we should call her husband?

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Uh, not just yet.

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's try vancomycin.
It worked for her before.

66
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,500
I don't want ian to worry.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,000
(Susan) this is
your new lawyer, alan marcus.

68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,600
Alan, this is mike delfino.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,100
Hey, mike. Sorry i couldn't
start on your case sooner.

70
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,600
I was wrapping up
an armed robbery trial.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
It's nice
to finally meet you.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
And you must be ian.

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I can't thank you enough
for helping me out here.

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,000
Susan and i are happy
to be of assistance.

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,400
(Susan)
so should we get started?

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Sure.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
So, mike,

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,300
I've had a chance to review
all the evidence against you,

79
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,800
And i've got a strategy

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
To ensure your case
never goes to trial.

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Don't you love this guy?
What's the strategy?

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,200
Pleading guilty?
What kind of a strategy is that?

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,900
He'd only be pleading
to manslaughter.

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,100
That's still
ten years in prison.
Well, which is better

85
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
And that's what mike's risking
if he goes to trial.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,500
With good behavior,
he could be out in five.
With a better lawyer,

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
He ???

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,200
We need to find a lawyer
who believes that he's innocent.

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, the evidence against him
is very compelling.

90
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
You're letting your feelings
for him cloud your judgment.

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,900
My "feelings for him"?
Are we gonna do this again?

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you realize that
every conversation we have

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Winds up being about mike?

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,800
"Who's the best lawyer for mike?
How can we get mike acquitted?"

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I have told you i love you
a thousand times.

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Where is all this jealousy
coming from?

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Do you know what?

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
I have to catch
that plane to montreal.

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,800
What? No, ian,
we have to talk about this.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I can't be late.
It's business.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Look, i have provided mike
with the best lawyer i know.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,300
If you want to get someone else,
then you're on your own.

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,400
(Parker) whatcha doing?

104
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, deciding what to wear
on my first day back to work.

105
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Do i look fat in this?

106
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
I think you look good
in everything.

107
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,400
Wow. Your father
has taught you well.

108
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
What about the street fair?

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
If you're going back to work,
who's gonna take me?

110
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
Mrs. Mccluskey.
Won't that be fun?

111
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,600
No.

112
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Do y have to
go back to work?

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,100
Come on. You and your brothers
will be thrilled.

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Don't you get tired of me
yelling at you

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,100
To clean up your room
and finish your homework?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah,

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,700
But you've been a lot nicer
since you got shot.

118
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh.
Well, that's good to know.

119
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,600
When you think about it,

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Me going back to work
is not that big a deal.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,600
We're only losing a ttle time
together in the afternoon.

122
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,300
But every hour counts.
I miss you all day long.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh, honey...

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
jeez.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Do you really mean that,

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,700
Or are you manipulating mommy
into feeling incredibly guilty?

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
A little bit of both.

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Yep. Your father's
taught you well.

129
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,200
(Vern) the suspense
is killing me.

130
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,100
(Whispering)
shh! Shh! Here it comes.

131
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,400
(Man) and now the moment
we've all been waiting for...

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,900
the winner of this year's

133
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Little miss snowflake pageant
is...

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
sherri maltby!

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,100
I'm in shock. I mean, i knew
she had a shot at the top five,

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
<i>But to actually win?</i>

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
I was sure she'd lose
to that little blonde bitch

138
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,200
Who sang
that patriotic medley.

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,500
I know. She practically had
sparklers coming out of her ass.

140
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
(Laughs) totally shameless.
Mm.

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,400
Okay, hon,
let's go meet those reporters.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,100
What are y gonna tell 'em?
I owe it all
to "beauty by vern."

143
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,000
Attagirl.

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,900
Oh, zach.
What are you doing here?

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,200
I came to support you.

146
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,900
Oh. Okay, why don't you
support me from the lobby?

147
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,900
I have some networking to do.
My girl just won the pageant.

148
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
Oh, yeah, i know,
and you're welcome.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What did you do?

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Don't worry.
I paid the judges in cash.

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
There's no paper trail.

152
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,400
You bribed the judges?!

153
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Gabrielle, why are we fighting?
We should be celebrating.

154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,400
I got a limo outside,
a bottle of chilled cristal.

155
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,100
Let's party.
Come on. Let's go.
Listen to me,

156
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
U ???

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
You and i
are never going to "party."

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,700
In ft, the only reason

159
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,400
We're ever gonna
be in the same room again

160
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,600
Is ???

161
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,300
God, i love it
when we banter.

162
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Ugh.

163
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,500
(Orson) hello, alma.

164
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,600
Orson.

165
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
Uh, i let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.

166
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Not at all.

167
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,200
You seem very cheerful.

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, i am,

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
'Cause the game's over,
and you lost.

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,900
I told you what i'd do
if you pushed me away.

171
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>Well, i'm afraid that threat
no longer has any teeth in it.</i>

172
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Yes, your mother told me
about bree's little discovery.

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,300
What'd you do
with monique's teeth?

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,900
Well, maybe i threw them away.
Maybe i hid them here.

175
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,800
You might find them,

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,500
If the police
don't find them first.

177
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,900
Oh, i don't think you'll
bring the police into this.

178
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, neither will you now.

179
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,800
We're done. Why don't you do us
all a favor and go away?

180
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
You shouldn't
treat me this way.

181
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Don't bother crying.

182
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Tears might've worked
when we were married,

183
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,500
After you lost the baby.
They won't work now.

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
We should have kept trying.

185
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,200
Ife'e'd had a child,
we'd still be together.

186
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,600
<i>I know.
That's why i stopped trying.</i>

187
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,300
Good-Bye, alma.

188
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Well,
here's some sucky news--

189
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300
Ken just quit.

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,100
Your new manager? No.
Yeah,  i'm screwed.

191
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm gonna have to drop out
of the street fair.

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,800
<i>Tom, no.
You can't. You can't.</i>

193
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
The pizzeria opens in a week,
and that street fair

194
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,900
Is the best advertising
we're gonna get.

195
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,000
I know,
but i can't work it alone.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, you know,
hire someone else.

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
Well, there's no time
fothat.

198
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
The future of the restaurant
is at stake.

199
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,300
It is time to get creative.

200
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,100
Well,
i do have one option,

201
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,600
But it would require some sacrifice.
Well, whatever it is ???

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You could help me.

203
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,000
What?! No.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
Unh-Unh.
Look, i'm wearing makeup.

205
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
I am holding a briefcase.
What does this suggest to you?

206
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,300
You could call in sick.

207
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,800
I can't call in sick
after eight weeks of sick leave,

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Especially when i've been fine
for three of them.

209
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh! Crap, that's ed.

210
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Lynette? Lynette, please?

211
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,600
You're the one who said
that we need the street fair.

212
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,900
My boss is waiting for me
outside in his car.

213
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,300
What am i supposed to do?

214
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
It's time to get creative.

215
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, there she is.
Oh.

216
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
(Weakly) hey, guys.

217
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,100
Boy, didn't expect you
to still be wearing a sling.

218
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, it heals
a little slower

219
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
When the bullet's
still in there.

220
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Oh. They couldn't
get it out?
No, it's too close.

221
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,400
To what?

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Everything.

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
God, i'm so sorry.

224
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,700
Oh. (Chuckles)

225
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,600
Hey, you got a little, uh,
cereal right...

226
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
cereal?
I didn't have any, uh...

227
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
oh, i know what that is.

228
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,300
I get nauseous
from the pain,

229
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,800
So that's just
a little residual vomit.

230
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Lynette, you sure you're ready
to come back to work?

231
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah! Don't be silly.
I'm fine.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Come on. Let's go
sell some toothpaste.

233
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
All righty! Let's go.

234
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,500
(Gasps) ow!
Ow! Son of a bitch!
Oh! No, no! I'm sorry!

235
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,100
Don't touch me, okay?
Anything we can do?

236
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,800
My pills!
My pain pills are in my bag.

237
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
Thanks.

238
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Oh! Oh, my pills!

239
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,000
(Whining) i need my pills,
and now they're all dirty!

240
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,000
See ya next week!

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Thanks for understanding!

242
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,200
Hey. Looks like
an interesting book.

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
What's it about?

244
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,700
Never mind.
I'll wait for the movie.

245
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
<i>What's eating you?
Those two guys
you saved me from?</i>

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
I know you paid 'em
to attack me.

247
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,500
That's a lie.
(Grunts) hey!

248
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,100
You wanna take a minute
to reconsider that?

249
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay. Okay. I needed a favor,
and i wanted you to owe me.

250
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
What favor?

251
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,500
You sure you want
to get into this now?

252
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Yeah.
Okay.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,700
You remember my son zach?

254
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,700
Vaguely. Why?

255
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Turns out you and i share
more than a cellblock.

256
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Hello, bree.
May i come in?

257
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
What's a garden
without a snake?

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
I realize
i'm not your favorite person,

259
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,300
But i thought you should know
why alma's moved here.

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
She wants orson back.

261
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,700
Thanks for the heads-Up.

262
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,500
Now off you go.

263
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Orson and i
may have our spats,

264
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
T i'm still deeply concerned
about the state of his soul.

265
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Adultery is a sin.

266
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
I wouldn't worry
about orson's soul.

267
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>He won't be
sleeping with alma.</i>

268
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
When i said "adultery"...

269
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,300
i wasn't referring
to orson and alma.

270
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,700
<i>I meant orson and you.</i>

271
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Excusee?

272
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Our church
doesn't accept divorce.

273
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,600
<i>In the eyes of god,
you're the other woman.</i>

274
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm sure you don't
see it that way,

275
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,500
But alma and i do...

276
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
and orson's beginning to.

277
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,600
Are those shoes suede?

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes. Why?

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,100
No reason.

280
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me i had a son?

281
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
You'd just
come out of a coma.

282
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
They probably figured
you had enough on your plate.

283
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
Well, why are you
telling me now?

284
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,800
Zach and i
haven't spoken in months.

285
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Every time i've tried to contact
him, he won't return the calls.

286
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
I don't know
what you expect me to do.

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,100
I barely remember the kid.

288
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes, but he remembers you,

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
And i think if you reach out
to him, he'll talk to you.

290
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
Zach is all i have left
in the world.

291
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,600
Through everything
that's happened,

292
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
I've never stopped
lovingim.

293
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Can you please get him
to come down here and see me?

294
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
That's one hell of a favor.

295
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
Man, you got some nerve.

296
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
I know.

297
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,400
It's kind of what
got me in here.

298
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Is it gaby's birthday?

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
No, they're probably
from zach young.

300
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
What?

301
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
You haven't heard?

302
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,800
He has been begging gaby
to go on a date with him.

303
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,300
He's been sending her
all sorts of stuff to bribe her,

304
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,400
Ev a a diamond bracelet.
Zach young?

305
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,800
<i>Mmmm.
Our zach young?
How does he afford diamonds?</i>

306
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,000
His grandfather
left him all that money.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, i thought
it was in a trust,

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,500
And he couldn't touch it.
Until he turned 18,
which was a month ago.

309
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,100
Wow.

310
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
So zach young
is loaded, huh?

311
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
No. Absolutely not.
Oh, come on.

312
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Mike needs a great lawyer.
Zach can afford a great lawyer.

313
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,600
I don't care. I'm not
going out with zach young!

314
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
It's one little date.

315
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,900
You wouldn't even let your own
daughter go out with him.

316
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,400
You said he was a psycho.
He's matured... to the tune
of a billion dollars.

317
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,600
Please do this... for mike.
Susan, do you know what

318
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Your obsession with mike
has cost you?

319
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
First you piss off bree
and then ian,

320
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,400
And--And now you're
pimping me out to a teenager!

321
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay, i deserve
the pimping remark,

322
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,300
But let's not pretend that,
you know, we're above teenagers.

323
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Gaby...

324
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
you're all i've got.

325
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, fine, i'll do it.

326
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Thank you! This is
a noble thing you're doing.

327
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,600
How n you be so sure
zach's gonna go along with this?

328
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,300
Oh, 'cause he's a great kid,

329
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,400
And he's gonna
want to help mike...

330
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
and you're not gonna be wearing
a bra when you ask him out.

331
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,600
Ooh, can you guys
just, uh, take five, please?
(Mrophone feedback whines)

332
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Gabrielle,
what are you doing here?

333
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,000
Wow, you have your own
recording studio in your house?

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Yeah, i needed a place
to lay some tracks with my band.

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,600
You, um, you see that guy?

336
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,700
He used to tour
with the doobie brothers.

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
How wild is that?

338
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
(Laughs) gee, well...

339
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,800
not as wild
as what i'm about to say.

340
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,200
You can take me to dinner.

341
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,600
Seriously? Awesome!

342
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Yeah, here's how
it's gonna work--

343
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
We drive to the restaurant
separately,

344
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
We will not have dessert,

345
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,500
<i>And under no circumstances
will you touch me. Capisce?</i>

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Um... okay.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,100
Great. In order for
this magical night to occur,

348
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,800
You're gonna need
to help mike delfino.

349
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
Mike? What happened?

350
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
'S in jail... for murder.
But susan swears he's innocent,

351
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,500
And she wants you
to get him a good lawyer.

352
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
All right, we have a deal?

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No.

354
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
No?

355
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, i-I would love
to help mike.

356
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,100
It's just that, uh, if i'm
paying for a lawyer, you know,

357
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,300
I would like to have more
than just one meal with you.

358
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,900
I'd likeo have
a whole day.

359
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,300
A whole day?

360
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, here's how
it's gonna work--

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
<i>Um, it's gonna be three meals
with dessert,</i>

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Activities of my choosing
and a...

363
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
a good night kiss.

364
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,100
Now do we--
Do we have a deal?

365
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,900
Not quite.

366
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,800
The day starts with lunch,
and that kiss--Off the table.

367
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,300
Did they set bail for mike?

368
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,300
You know, 'cause i-I could
throw that in, too.

369
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
$1 million.

370
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
It's no biggie.

371
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,600
One call to my accountant,
and mike's a free man.

372
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Or do you
want to tell susan

373
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,900
That mike's gonna stay in jail
because you wouldn't kiss me?

374
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,600
Okay, deal,
you little skunk.

375
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,400
Here you go.
You can come back for seconds.

376
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
Our famous pepperoni pizza.

377
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,100
Here's another
canadian bacon.
There yogogo.

378
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,600
Great. Guess what? Our line
is the biggest one at the fair.

379
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I counted.

380
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,500
(Laughs) you know
what i'm starting to think?

381
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,300
What?

382
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,100
This restaurant is gonna be
a big, fat hit.
Here you go.

383
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Can i talk to you
about something?

384
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I think you hurt
lynette's feelings

385
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
When you refused to go
to the street fair with her.

386
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
She's gonna start to think
you don't like her.

387
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,300
You don't want that,
do you?

388
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,900
Doorbell.

389
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,300
(Under breath) some of 'em should be left
on a hillside to rot.

390
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Hi.
Hi.

391
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,200
I'm ed ferrara, lynette's boss.
Is, uh, she around?
Uh, well, actually,

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,900
She's at the, uh, uh,
the, uh, doctor's.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Oh. Yeah. Well,
could you give h this?
Oh. Sure.

394
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
And tell her to get well.

395
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,300
Mm-Hmm.
And she doesn't need
to come back to work

396
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Till she's good and ready.
I will make sure
she gets this.

397
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,500
Okay.

398
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Excuse me. Mister?

399
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
I just wanted to tell you

400
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,600
Our babysitter
gets mixed up sometimes.

401
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,600
Lynette's
not at the doctor's.

402
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
She's not?

403
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,100
Nope.

404
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Well... where is she?

405
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,200
Excuse me.

406
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,000
Hey.
Try some of that. Hey.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Load me up again,
would ya?
Yeah?

408
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm gonna go
poach some customers

409
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Sausage-On-A-Stick guy.
From that
oh, i love it ???

410
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,000
Scavo's pizzeria!

411
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,200
Try the smoked chicken
and sundried tomato. Mmm!

412
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Mmm!
Oh!

413
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
This crust is fantastic!

414
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,500
It's cornmeal.
That's the secret. (Laughs)

415
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,700
It's not your only secret,
is it, lynette?

416
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,900
Uh, hi, ed.

417
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,100
How's the arm?

418
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,500
Uh... uh, on the mend,

419
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,100
But i'm gonna be there
bright and early monday morning.

420
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Don't bother. You're fired.

421
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,900
(Gasps) wait, ed!
Ed, please don't go.

422
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Yes, i lied, and that was wrong,
but my husband needed my help.

423
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,400
<i>I need your help. You've been
gone eight weeks, with pay,</i>

424
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,300
While the company's
been falling apart.

425
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,500
Okay--
And now
you pull this on me?

426
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,100
Like i said,
really, really wrong,

427
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,600
But if you take me back,
i swear i will give you 100%.

428
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,600
So... if we have to work late,
you're gonna do it.

429
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,000
If i ask you to miss
your kid's baseball game,

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,300
You're gonna say,
"no problem, ed"?

431
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,800
You got it, ed.

432
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Good. I'll see you monday.

433
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
Hi. It's--It's me.

434
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
Um, listen,
we--We--We have to talk.

435
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,400
Ian, i'm sorry, too. We've got
to stop fighting like this.

436
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Susan, um,
jane's doctor called me.

437
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,600
She's--She's taken
a bad turn.

438
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,100
Oh. Ian...

439
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,600
i'm, uh, i'm on
the next flight out,

440
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,300
But it's not for aew hours,
and jane's parents are in rome.

441
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,100
Would, uh, would you go
to the hospital for me?

442
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,000
The hospital?
Well, i-I know
it's a lot to ask,

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But if something
should happen, i--

444
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
Well, i don't want her
to be alone.

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,300
Oh ???

446
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,500
I can't believe you talked me
into that crème brûlée.

447
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Oh, don't feel guilty.

448
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,400
I'm sure we burned it offon the

449
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,700
I know!
You're such a good dancer!

450
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Mm-Hmm.
Where'd you learn
how to salsa?

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I've been taking lessons 'cause
i knew it was your favorite.

452
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,600
When did i say that?
"Cosmo," '98.

453
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
And i knew you liked that merlot
from your "vogue" interview.

454
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,800
You researched me?
That's sweet!

455
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,300
In a, uh,
stalkery kind of way.

456
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,400
Thanks again for
a surprisingly enjoyable night.

457
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,700
(Chuckles) see you around.

458
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,100
Uh... gaby?

459
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,300
(Gasps) oh!

460
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Right, the kiss.

461
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Sorry. I didn't mean
to welsh on ya.

462
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,500
All right.

463
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,200
Pucker up.

464
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
Aah! Ow!

465
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,000
What the hell are you doing?!
But you said ???

466
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,200
Yes, my lips,not my esophagus!
For your information,

467
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm a very good kisser,all right?
By who? The same girl

468
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,500
To use your tongue
like a windshield wiper?

469
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,800
No, by women--
Women with lots of experience--

470
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,300
And every single one of them
said that i was a great kisser.

471
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,700
(Scoffs) how much
did you pay them to say that?

472
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,900
No!

473
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,700
You've paid women for--
It's none of your business,
all right?

474
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,400
It's none of your business.
Uh, yes, it is.
You just vacuumed my tonsils.

475
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,200
I deserve to know
where that mouth has been.

476
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
You know what?
I-I-I'm sorry. I gotta go.

477
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,000
Wait, zach.
Zach, i'm not mad!

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Ok hey, i'm just a little...

479
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,100
grossed out, that's all!

480
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,300
(Woman) no, you heard me.
You heard me, all right?

481
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,900
Read my lips.
Just go, all right?

482
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Go! You've got no right
to be here!

483
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,000
All right!

484
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
What, another one?

485
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,800
You organ donor people
are vultures.

486
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,400
Um, no, actually,
i'm a friend of ian's.

487
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,700
He asked me to come...
for jane.

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,300
Oh, you...
you're the girlfriend.

489
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,500
All right, that's okay then.
Come on in.

490
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,500
So, erika, uh, youere fighting
with that guy when i came in.

491
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Have you had a lot of those
organ donor people around today?

492
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Oh, that wasn't about that.

493
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
No, that was ted.

494
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,700
What, ian never told you about ???

495
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
No. What about them?

496
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,300
Nothing. Forget i mentioned it.
It is not my place.

497
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,800
What?

498
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,000
They had an affair.

499
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Jane cheated on ian?
When was this?

500
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,900
I hate to dish my best friend
on her deathbed...

501
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,200
but gossip was the foundation
of our relationship, so...

502
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
it was five years ago.

503
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,400
Ian was traveling a lot
on business,

504
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Jane was lonely,
and along came ted.

505
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm just stunned.

506
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,500
So i guess
they worked it out, right?

507
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Well, ian took her back.

508
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
But if you're asking, did he
ever really trust her again?

509
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't think so.

510
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,600
Poor ian.

511
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,900
Mm. You don't know
the half of it.

512
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,400
<i>I mean, to be betrayed by
somebody you loved that much...</i>

513
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,000
ugh. You're just
never the same

514
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,900
Hey. What are you doing here?

515
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,800
Um, word on the street is
you're looking for a manager.

516
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,900
(Chuckles) yeah.

517
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,400
Here's my application.

518
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
I thought ed took you back.

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,600
He did. I told him
i wasn't interested.

520
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,700
<i>What?</i>

521
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,400
You're quitting?

522
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
I had so much fun
at the fair today,

523
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Working with you
on something that was all ours.

524
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,700
I want every day
to be like that.

525
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,100
Honey, so do i.
Are--Are you sure?

526
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,200
I mean, your career's
always meant so much to you.

527
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
When i got shot and i was
lying there bleeding,

528
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,300
I wasn't thinking,

529
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,700
"God, i'm really
gonna miss advertising."

530
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,100
I think this could be
the best thing

531
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
That's ever happened
to our family.

532
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,200
We can make our own hours,
we'll be together more,

533
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,100
And, yes, the money
is gna be a little tight,

534
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
But i think this place
could be a gold mine.

535
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,300
In that case, you're hired.

536
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,500
You do, of course, realize
you have to sleep with the boss.

537
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
I can do that.

538
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Good.

539
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,700
Whoa. It's a little soon
to be gunning for a promotion.

540
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,700
Your mother not home yet?

541
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Uh, i haven't seen her.
Huh.

542
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
Hello?

543
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
What is it now?

544
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,000
Alma did what?!

545
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
No, no.
I'll be right over.

546
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,300
Wait, wait, what--What--
What did alma do?

547
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,900
I just thank the lord
i got here when i did.

548
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,800
But why didn't you
call an ambulance?

549
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,700
I thought it best for all
concerned to keep this quiet.

550
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way,
she left a note.

551
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,800
She only did this
to upset me.

552
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
She knows my history.

553
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,800
She knows
exactly what buttons to push.

554
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,300
Orson, calm down.

555
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,100
Here.

556
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,000
Our marriage is over.

557
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
I will not submit
to emotional blackmail.

558
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,600
Are you all right?

559
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
I feel dizzy.
(Clears throat)

560
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,200
Then perhaps
you should just...

561
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,300
sit.

562
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,200
My god.

563
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,100
Did you poison me?

564
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
And kill my only child?

565
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
You see how he talks to me?

566
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,400
It's my fault.
I upset him.

567
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
Sorry about all this.

568
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,600
I ju needed
to get your attention.

569
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,600
Why?

570
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,700
What do you want?

571
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,600
What every mother wants,
dear...

572
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,500
a grandchild.

573
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Wewell, why don't i
give you two some privacy?

574
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Thank you, mother hodge.

575
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
You mustn't struggle.

576
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,700
I want this baby
to be born of love.

577
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
I've been
injecting myself...

578
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
with hormones

579
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,800
To improve our chances.

580
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,000
You wait and see.
This is gonna fix everything.

581
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
You're crazy.

582
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,300
Crazy for you, mister!

583
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,900
I won't. You can't make me.

584
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,800
(Grunts)
why, yes, i can.

585
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
That drink had
two kinds of pills in it--

586
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
One to put you to sleep

587
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,600
And one to keep
the part of you i need

588
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,200
Nice and perky.

589
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,900
Now... how about
a little music?

590
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
<i>* we're all alone </i>

591
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>* no chaperone
can get our number *</i>

592
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,200
<i>* the world's in slumber </i>

593
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,800
<i>* let's misbehave
(mthing words)</i>

594
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,100
The doctor was just here.

595
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,300
He said her blood pressure's
dropping. She could go anytime.

596
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,900
I, uh, gotta
go call her parents.

597
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,000
Hi.

598
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's me.
We--We just took off.

599
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,700
I-I'll be there
in about six hours.

600
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,300
Uh, sweetie, i don't think
she's gonna make it that long.

601
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,600
(Exhales deeply)
don't tell me that.

602
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,600
You've done everything
you could.

603
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,000
She knows
that you love her.

604
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, it's just there's--There's
things i've got to say to her.

605
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I've carried around
so much anger

606
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,500
About something that doesn't
mean anything now,

607
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,600
And i--And i-I need her
to know that.

608
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,100
I'm gonna put the phone
up to jane's ear,

609
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,700
And you can tell her
whatever you need to, okay?

610
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay.

611
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,600
Hello, jane, darling.
It's ian.

612
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,000
I never imagined i'd have to

613
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,900
There's so much i want to say.

614
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,500
You play that pretty well.

615
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,200
What are you doing here?

616
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,100
I had a good time tonight,

617
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,600
But... i hated
the way it ended.

618
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, me, too.

619
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
Gaby...

620
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,800
about those women...

621
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,500
forget about it.

622
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,700
Give a horny kid
a couple million bucks

623
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,400
And the yellow pages,
and stuff is gonna happen.

624
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,600
It's not just them. I...

625
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,200
i'm paying everyone
that i know.

626
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Those guys in my band--
They're not my friends.

627
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm... hiring them
to hang out with me.

628
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
So stop doing it.

629
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,300
Stop buying people.

630
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,600
Yeah, right,
and then i'd have no one at all.

631
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
That's not true.

632
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
You'd have me.

633
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
<i>As a friend.
A friend friend.</i>

634
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Not a girlfriend.

635
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,000
I really cannot
overstress that.

636
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on.

637
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,100
Why do you
wanna be my friend?

638
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,100
We have zero in common.

639
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,100
I don't know.

640
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,900
Maybe it's because
i think we're both... adrift.

641
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
Who gets
what i'm going thrgh.

642
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,000
Why don't you play me
something you wrote?

643
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,300
Yeah?
Mm-Hmm.

644
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,300
Okay. Can i sing, too?

645
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,800
Sure. Why not?

646
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,300
All right.

647
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,600
* gaby

648
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,400
* sweet gaby--

649
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,000
Whoa. Why don't you
just hum it, okay?

650
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,200
<i>(Laughter on tv)</i>

651
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Hi.

652
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,500
Sorry.
My book club ran late.

653
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Didn't orson
make you dinner?

654
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,600
Oh, no.
He's been over at alma's.

655
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,300
He's been there
for a few hours now.

656
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,100
What the hell is this?!

657
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh, bree. I'soso sorry
you had to find out this way.

658
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,000
Not as sorry
as you are gonna be!

659
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,700
Orson, get up!
Leave him alone.

660
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,000
He wants to be with me now.
Orson,i have caught you cheati

661
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,200
At least have the courtesy
to wake up!

662
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Oh, for god sakes.

663
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,600
Ooh! Aah!

664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,900
Orson!

665
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,100
Orson?

666
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,100
What have you done to him?!

667
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,300
Nothing. You know men.

668
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
The minute it's over--
Wham, off to dreamland.

669
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,900
He's not sleeping.
He's out cold.

670
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Oh, i knew it.

671
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
These are sleeping pills,
and these are...

672
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
(whispers) oh, my god.

673
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,400
You raped my husband!

674
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,500
We made love,

675
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,000
And when our baby's born,
he's gonna come back to me.

676
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
Baby?!
It's true.

677
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,800
I could be expecting
right now.

678
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Were you expecting this?

679
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Oh!

680
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,800
Andrew, i need you
to come over here right away...

681
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,100
and, um...

682
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
bring the wheelbarrow.

683
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,400
Hi.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
Do...
do you remember me?

685
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,700
No.

686
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,300
No, not really.

687
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But i know who you are.

688
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,900
Okay. Good.

689
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,300
Um...

690
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,000
what you did,
i'm, um... really grateful.

691
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,000
It's cool.

692
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,700
So if you need anything else,
i guess...

693
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,700
just let me know.

694
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,500
Well, i do need something.

695
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,800
But it's not for me.

696
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
(Man) take it to the end.
Move.

697
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,100
So how you doing?

698
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,900
You look terrific,
really mature.

699
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,700
Your mother would be proud.

700
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,400
Thanks.

701
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I've, uh,
really missed you a lot,

702
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,900
And i'm sorry for, uh...
for everything.

703
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,200
I hope you can forgive me.
I want us to be friends.

704
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,600
And that's the only reason
you wanted to see me, right?

705
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,000
So we could be friends?

706
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Yes.

707
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,900
Okay.

708
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,400
That's great. That's fine.

709
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,300
Well, there is
one other thing.

710
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh. Yeah.

711
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,500
It's just... felicia tillman
faked her death.

712
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,400
She's still out there.
You and i, we both know that.

713
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,600
<i>If you gave--
Or lent me some money,</i>

714
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
I could hire someone
to track her down,

715
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,700
And then
i could get out of here,

716
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,800
And you and i could
pick up where we left off.

717
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,300
(Sighs) okay...

718
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,200
you asked me
how i was doing.

719
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,600
I'm actually doing great.

720
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,600
I've got the hottest,
most amazing girlfriend

721
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,300
In the entire world,
and i am gonna marry that woman.

722
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm gonna buy her
everything she wants.

723
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,300
So...

724
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,400
i have got to learn to say no
when people ask me for money,

725
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,500
Because i got a future wife
to think about.

726
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,800
She's got
really expenveve taste.

727
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,600
I mean, i do forgive you,
though...

728
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,500
paul.

729
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Hey, susan.

730
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
Hey. You're back.

731
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah,
zach young posted my bail,

732
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,300
But i'm guessing you had
something to do with it.

733
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Maybe a little.

734
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,800
Is there any way
that i can thank you,

735
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,500
You know,
for everything you've done?

736
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,200
Actually, yeah, there is.

737
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,000
Good. Good. Just tell me.

738
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,300
I can't see you anymore.

739
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
I want you to understand

740
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,600
It doesn't have
anything to do with you.

741
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,400
It's just...

742
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
that's okay. It's not...

743
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,800
i think i get it.

744
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,100
Well, i, uh,
i should probably go.

745
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,500
Bye.

746
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,000
Good--Good luck
with everything.

747
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,200
Good luck to you and ian.

748
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>Yes,
it can happen so quickly.</i>

749
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,700
<i>Life as we know it can change
in the blink of an eye.</i>

750
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,700
<i>Unlikely friendships
can blossom...</i>

751
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,800
<i>important careers
can be tossed aside...</i>

752
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,100
<i>a long-Lost hope
can be rekindled.</i>

753
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,100
<i>Still, we should be grateful</i>

754
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,600
<i>For whatever changes
life throws at us,</i>

755
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,500
<i>Because all too soon
the day will come...</i>

756
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,300
<i>when there are
no changes left.</i>

757
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,600
