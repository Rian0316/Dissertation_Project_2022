00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,920
Right. You didn't think of a hamster?

175
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,560
Or, um, a terrapin?

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Or a worm farm?

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
How's Eugene?

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
[sighs] I mean, long-distance is hard,

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,600
but I think if we play our cards right,
we'll both end up at Oxford.

180
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,000
Did I tell you he speaks six languages?

181
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
[journalist] Here are some of the students
currently attendingwhat has been dubbed

183
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
<i>the "Sex School."</i>

184
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, excuse me, young man,
what can you tell us

185
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
about last year's chlamydia outbreak
on campus?

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
[whispers] Please speak.

187
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
<i>We're live.</i>

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
[sniffs]

189
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, hi. Hi.

190
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
<i>I'm Eric Effiong.</i>

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,320
<i>And all I can say about the outbreak was
that it was absolutely terrifying.</i>

192
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
<i>We were scared for our lives.</i>

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
[Eric chuckles]

194
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Do you have an opinion, young man?

195
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,640
<i>Yes.</i>

196
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,280
<i>Firstly, it was mass hysteria,</i>

197
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,480
not a chlamydia outbreak.
Your facts are wrong.

198
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
- Otis, shh! We're on TV.
- [girl] Yeah, shut up, Milburn!

199
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,280
- Are you Dr. Jean Milburn's son?
- Yes. Yes, he is that.

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Are the students of Moordale as depraved
as your mother makes out in her new book?

201
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,760
I think my mum's book is
an honest insight into teenagers today,

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,040
and people should probably read it
before speculating.

203
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
<i>You should probably read it.</i>

204
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,120
<i>Probably.</i>

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,960
[bell ringing]

206
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
It's true. I do love an empty school.

207
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
- But it's nice to see the students.
- Priceless.

208
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,520
I used to teach geography
before I became a headmaster.

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm also very experienced
in teaching history and...

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Groff.
We will consider your application.

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
Are you actually going to consider
my application?

212
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,600
No.

213
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm sorry. The controversy surrounding
Moordale Secondary is too fresh.

214
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
You're also far too experienced
for this role.

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,880
This is the fifth teaching position
that I've applied for,

216
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,120
and frankly, I'm running out of options.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
It's still a no.

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
Good morning, Moordale!

232
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
How is everyone feeling today?

233
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Really good!

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
I am your new head teacher, Mrs. Haddon,

235
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
but you can call me Hope.

236
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,840
[whispers] She's cool.
Teachers aren't supposed to be cool.

237
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,040
The first thing you need to know about me

238
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
is that I used to be sitting
where you are now.

239
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Literally. [chuckles]

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, I went to Moordale too.

241
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
- I love her lipstick. It's so bold.
- Mm.

242
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
[Hope] I've achieved a lot since then.

243
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,240
Two degrees, teaching positions
at some of the country's top institutions,

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,040
and by 28, I became
the youngest head teacher in the UK.

245
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,320
But the years I spent in this building
were the best of my life.

246
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,080
This school not only encouraged me
to excel academically,

247
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
but it truly allowed me
to find my purpose.

248
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,080
Which is why it's been so hurtful
to read some of the horrible things

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,280
written about Moordale in the press.

250
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
I don't know what went wrong

251
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
or how we ended up here,

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
but I do know

253
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,680
it changes today.

254
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
I can promise you this.

255
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,840
If you work hard
and you take pride in your school,

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,440
I will get Moordale and your futures

257
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,360
back on track.

258
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
- [girl] Yeah!
- Oh!

259
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
- Wow!
- Come on, girl!

260
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,280
[Hope] So let me hear you.

261
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,360
Let's get Moordale…

262
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
Back on track!

263
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
Let's get Moordale…

264
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,000
- I love her.
- [crowd] Back on track!

265
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
She's like Joan of Arc, but cooler.

266
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
- Back on track!
- Yes!

267
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
[music continues]

268
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,800
- Wow!
- [crowd cheering]

269
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,560
- [Hope] Thank you all!
- Come on.

270
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,200
To a great start and a great week. And oh!

271
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Can Otis Milburn
and Maeve Wiley come to my office, please?

272
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
You get to meet her in the flesh.

273
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
Maeve!

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,280
[whimsical music playing]

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
Hi, Jakob!

276
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
You're looking well.

277
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, this?

278
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
[chuckles]

279
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Funny story.

280
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,320
You impregnated me.

281
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Surprise!

282
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
Oh shit.

283
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240

[tools clanking]

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
Damn it! Shit, shit, shit!

287
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,840
How come you're back in school?

288
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
I wanna learn some shit, don't I?

289
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,840
You must be Jackson Marchetti,
famed head boy.

290
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,000
That would be me.

291
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
Of course. Of course.

292
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,240
Acting, swimming extraordinaire.

293
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm re-enrolling.
I think I need to take some kind of test.

294
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,720
Ah, yes, Mr. Groff's son.

295
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,640
My receptionist has your paperwork.

296
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,240
Hi, guys. You can go straight in.

297
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,720
[whimsical music continues]

298
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Jackson,
can I get you to come back a bit later?

299
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
It was really lovely to meet you.

300
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
[Hope] I've heard
a lot about the two of you.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Sit down.

302
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,320
Don't worry. You're not in any trouble.

303
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,800
An on-campus sex clinic for teenagers is
rather entrepreneurial, in my opinion.

304
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,440
Shows a lot of business savvy.

305
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,920
Is it something you're wanting to pursue?

306
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,160
N… no.

307
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,600
No. We don't run the clinic anymore.

308
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,320
[inhales sharply] We've realized
it wasn't very ethical, and we...

309
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,240
We sort of stopped being friends.
We grew apart.

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,880
[Hope] Oh. That's a shame.

311
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Anyway, I just wanted to say that Moordale
is here to encourage your passions.

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
It would be great
if you could keep me in the loop

313
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,560
of any further business endeavors
you come up with in the future.

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
[Maeve chuckles]

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,280
That's it.

316
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
[Otis sighs] Okay.

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,720
[clears throat] Thank you.

318
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,800
[Hope] Oh, Otis…

319
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,040
Tell your mum I'm really looking forward
to reading her book.

320
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I will… Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
- I thought we were screwed.
- [chuckles] Me too.

322

[Maeve chuckles]

323
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,360
- Shit. Well, thank God.
- Yeah.

324
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
[Otis] So why aren't we friends anymore?

325
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Nice beard.

326
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,480
What's your point?

327
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Nothing.

328
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,640
We're just in different places.

329
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
If that's what you wanna call it.

330
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,280
[Maeve chuckles]

331
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Bye, Otis.

332
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,240
Maeve?

333
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
Yeah?

334
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,920
It's called a mustache.

335
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Yeah, no shit.

336
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,400

- Wait. Did anyone see you coming in?
- No, I was careful.

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,440
Okay.

344
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
Careful there. Careful there.

345
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,680
Okay.

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,040
[Dex] Yeah!

702
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on!

703
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,680
For the love of God! Come on!

704
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
[Dex] Come on!

705
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,680
[groaning]

706
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,080
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

707
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,760
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- And you.

708
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
We were thinking, I don't know…

709
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Shit!

710
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,760
Strange.

711
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,200
[grunts] I guess
it's lost property for you.

712
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
[door opens, closes]

713
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,840
Fuck.

714
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
[both exclaim]

715
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
Dude, why are you naked?

716
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
Don't look at my dick!

717
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
[whimsical music continues]

718
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
[door opens, closes]

719
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Hey, Otis. Is it true that you
and Ruby are a thing now?

720
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,000
No. No. Why did you say that?

721
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,360
Everyone's talking about it.

722
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,760
[panting]

723
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,720
[whistle blowing]

724
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,400
[girl shouts indistinctly]

725
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,560
Sex King.

726
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,960
[girls cheering]

727
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,240
[grunts]

728
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,840
So in the structure,
the double bond causes a kink in the tail.

729
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
Uh-huh.

730
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,200
So… Aimee Gibbs!

731
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,480
Sir, I need to take Goat out for a wee.

732
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
[Hendricks] Right, fine. Go on.

733
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,000
See, this is exactly why you shouldn't be
bringing livestock into school.

734
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,360
- My mum's looking after her tomorrow.
- Good.

735
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,120
Okay, this is the only goat
you should be seeing in school.

736
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,560
Uh, it's a goatee.

737
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,040
It's my new look. Hands up who likes it.

738
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,880
[panting]

739
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Oh God. Oh God.

740
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,480
[panting]

741
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
[Dex groaning]

742
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
[panting]

743
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
Do a wee for Mummy.

744
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,760
- What the f...
- [Dex screaming]

745
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,240
[Hendricks] Fatty acids!

746
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,600
- Okay…
- Sir, Dex Thompson's naked!

747
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,360
[screaming]

748
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,880
["Oh Yeah" by Yello continues]

749
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,800
Oh my God! It's tiny!

750
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,840
Look away!
I don't want you to see my dick!

751
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
- [chanting]
- [Dex] Fuck!

752
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,840
[chanting] Penis!

753
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,160
What is happening? Tell me now!

754
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,040
Why are you naked?

755
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,480
Dex?

756
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,360
- [Dex] I need to borrow this.
- No, not my goat. Not my goat.

757
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,120
- I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
- Don't take her!

758
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
- I'll bring it back.
- Please!

759
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,360
- I'm sorry.
- Please!

760
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,080
[classroom chanting] Goat!

761
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
I would say I'm here to try
and bring back a sense of community

762
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
and family values that...

763
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,600
Is that a dog?

764
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,520
[journalist] <i>It's a fucking goat.</i>
<i>Film it, for Christ's sake!</i>

765
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,880
What were you saying about family values,
Headmistress?

766
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,680
<i>Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.</i>

767
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
[song ends]

768
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,360
[typing]

769
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,440
No.

770
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,320
No, no, no!

771
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,120
No, no, no, no!

772
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
[whimsical music playing]

773
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,560
I think I just lost all my work.

774
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,760
Yeah, the computers are terrible.
Maybe get a laptop.

775
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,720
[door opens, closes]

776
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,880
- Hey. Hey, have you seen Kyle?
- No.

777
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,320
[goat bleating]

778
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,560
[Dex] I should never have listened
to the fucking Sex King!

779
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
[sniffles, exhales]

780
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
Dex, are you okay?

781
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,040
I should never have listened
to the Sex King.

782
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,080
Who's the Sex King?

783
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,560
Kyle.

784
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,560
[Jean grunts] Okay, okay, okay.

785
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,760
[groaning]

786
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,920
- [gasps]
- [Jakob] Hey!

787
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,960
Are you stalking me, woman?

788
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,080
No! No, don't be ridiculous.

789
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,360
I just happened to be driving by
this place where you work.

790
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,360
You've driven past 15 times!

791
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,640
I can see you out the window.

792
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,200
What's going on?

793
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,240
[exhales sharply]

794
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,640
Can we talk?

795
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,840
- If you stop being scary.
- [sighs]

796
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,880
[Jakob] Yes.

797
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,680
- Are you stepping out?
- Mm-hmm.

798
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,680
Good.

799
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,800
[Otis] <i>So, Dex,</i>

800
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,080
how did we get here?

801
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,480
I was measuring my penis.

802
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,080
Mm. I told him to do that.
So what're your stats, then?

803
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,240
I was interrupted.

804
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,840
And I don't wanna know.

805
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,240
What if I do have a small penis,
and I can never please a woman?

806
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Maybe you can look at it for me
and tell me if it's small.

807
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
- Yeah! Sure.
- No! No! No!

808
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,920
No! No, nobody's inspecting anything

809
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
because penis size isn't important.

810
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,280
[scoffs]
Only guys with small dicks say that.

811
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,120
Dex, you shouldn't compare
the size of your dick to anyone else's.

812
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,640
It's irrelevant and unhelpful.

813
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,960
You'd also be surprised

814
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,720
how many guys have insecurities
about the size of their penis

815
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,440
and exaggerated views
as to what other male genitals look like.

816
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,080
It's true. I wish mine was straighter.

817
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,720
It sort of bends to the side a bit.

818
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,440
It's… it's wonky, you know?

819
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,520
It's not wonky.

820
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,200
It's unique.

821
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,960
[chuckles] Thanks, Milburn.

822
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,920
That means a lot.

823
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,920
Well, that's very touching.

824
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,440
Dex, why did you say
you'll never please a woman?

825
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,360
[laughs] He can't make
his girlfriend come during sex.

826
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,000
What kind of sex?

827
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,480
You know, just normal fucking.

828
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,040
Okay. Well, most women struggle
to orgasm from penetration alone.

829
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,240
- [scoffs] Really?
- Yeah.

830
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,600
You heard of the clitoris?

831
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,400
Sure.

832
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,160
Might be time to get acquainted with it.
Ask your girlfriend what she likes.

833
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,720
And remember that orgasm
doesn't have to be the main goal of sex.

834
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,440
You can have fun

835
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,200
and be creative.

836
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,120
Could you clarify?

837
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,680
You have ten fingers and a tongue, Dex.

838
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,480
Use your imagination.

839
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,560
[Kyle] Wow.

840
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,160
You guys are actually really good
at giving out sex advice.

841
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,200
Maybe keep this on the down-low?
Could be bad for my business.

842
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,600
Hey. I'm going to lost property,
but thanks for the help.

843
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,120
Oh! And, hey, Otis,
I heard about you and Ruby.

844
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,840
Don't know how
you pulled that off, but congrats.

845
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,240
- You and Ruby are a thing.
- [splutters] Well, we're not anymore.

846
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,240
We were for a bit,
but it was casual, you know?

847
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,360
No feelings.

848
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,680
No feelings. Sounds cool.

849
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Thanks for telling everyone, Kyle.

850
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Well, I didn't tell anyone.

851
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,600
[chuckles] But now everyone knows
about you and Ruby,

852
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,520
guess I can carry on being the Sex King.

853
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,360
Au revoir, loser!

854
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,480
It means
exactly the opposite of that, Kyle!

855
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,640
[Jean] I didn't know
whether I was going to keep it.

856
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
I was confused, and

857
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
I kept putting it off.

858
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,320
Then I started writing my book.

859
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,960
And I enjoyed every second of that,
and I got immersed.

860
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,200
- How could you keep this from me?
- I wanted to tell you, I did.

861
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,440
I... But the…

862
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,440
The longer I waited, the harder it got.

863
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
I'm having a baby?

864
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,680
[exhales sharply]

865
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,440
I don't want you to feel
backed into a corner.

866
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,000
I have decided to keep this baby,

867
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,800
and I feel empowered by that choice, and…

868
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,280
I only need you to be involved if you feel
it's something that you would like.

869
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,680
Do you want me to be involved?

870
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,600
Of course I do.

871
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,200
But only if you want to be involved.

872
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,640
[scoffs]

873
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,240
I have a scan

874
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,320
tonight at 4:30.

875
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,240
- At Moordale Community Hospital. You...
- Thank you.

876
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,640
I really have to think about this.

877
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,880
- Of course.
- Yeah.

878
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,120
[Hope on video] <i>I would say I'm here</i>

879
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680

a sense of community and family values.</i>

[knocking at door]

881
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,720

- Come in.

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,840
<i>Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.</i>

883
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,400
The clinic is still running
in the old toilet block.

884
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,040
Maeve and I have nothing to do with it,

885
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,240
but it's still happening,
and it's dangerous.

886
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,440
Students shouldn't be getting advice
from students,

887
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,480
but they still need help,

888
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,920
so hopefully, you can provide
the right service on campus.

889
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
Thank you for telling me, Otis.

[funky music playing]

891
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,120
Miss Sands, I did type up my essay,
but the school computer broke.

892
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,400
- Can I get an extension?
- Okay. Don't let it happen again.

893
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,160
Oh, uh, Maeve,
have a look at applying for that.

894
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,440
You're the perfect candidate.

895
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,960
Adam, I marked your test this afternoon.
Here's your timetable.

896
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,520
Ah! What set are you in?

897
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,640
Take a guess.

898
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,600
Eric. Eric!
Everybody knows about me and Ruby.

899
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,800
Did you tell anyone?

900
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,600
I accidentally told Adam.

901
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
And I told Ola.

902
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
- I told Lily.
- And I told everyone.

903
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,720
This was supposed to stay
between me and you!

904
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
What are you doing here?

905
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,000
I sold my first painting,
so no beans on toast for us tonight.

906
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,880
We are going out for pizza!

907
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,080
Oh, well done.
Always knew you would, genius.

908
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,760
Apparently, you're secretly sleeping
with Otis Milburn. [scoffs]

909
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Ugh! As if.

910
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
It's true.

[Maeve, Isaac laugh]

912
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,320
[Maeve] No, it's really not.
It's really not.

00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,240
[phone ringing]

914
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,240
[Maeve] Mum?

915
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,800
Hi, how are you?

I was thinking
we could keep seeing each other?

You know,
