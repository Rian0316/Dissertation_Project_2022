1
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,100

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,500

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800

4
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,700
克莱蒂特先生
Mr. Cretites?

5
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,999
保罗・克莱蒂特
...Paul Cretites.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,299
我是拉蒂默
My name is Latimer.

7
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,200
我是来接你的 克莱蒂特先生
I've come to meet you, Mr. Cretites.

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,299
这边请 克莱蒂特先生
Just come this way, Mr. Cretites.

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,000
我们已经为你备好了一辆马车
We have a carriage waiting.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,700
希腊译员

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,291
我和福尔摩斯认识已久
During my long and intimate acquaintance

12
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,960
亲密无间
with Sherlock Holmes,

13
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,505
但从未听他提起过他的家人
I'd never heard him refer to his relations,

14
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:48,902
也很少听他讲起自己早年的生活
and hardly ever to his own early life.

15
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,968
他这样沉默寡言 我有时
Because of this reticence, I sometimes found myself

16
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,053
会认为他是个孤僻的怪人
regarding him as an isolated phenomenon

17
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,243
缺少同情心
as deficient in human sympathy

18
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,058
但又有着过人的智慧
as he was pre-eminent in intelligence.

19
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,871
我开始认为他是个孤儿
I'd come to believe that he was an orphan

20
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,435
没有亲人在世了
with no relatives living.

21
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:08,398
但是有一天 让我倍感惊奇的是
But one day, to my very great surprise,

22
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,421
他居然和我谈起了他的家庭
he began to talk to me about his family.

23
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,111
我独一无二的洞察力
My singular gift of observation introduction

24
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,675
可能是遗传自我奶奶
may have come from my grandmother,

25
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,115
她是法国艺术家巴内的妹妹
who was a sister of Bernais, the French artist.

26
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,262
血液中的这种艺术成分
The art in the blood

27
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,182
很容易具有最奇特的遗传形式
is liable to take the strangest forms.

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,414
比如说 我哥哥 迈克罗夫
For example, my brother, Mycroft.

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,750
你哥哥
Your brother?

30
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,190
我一直都不知道你有个哥哥
I didn't know you had a brother?

31
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,858
噢 没错
Oh, yes.

32
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,734
而且我可以向你保证
And I can assure you,

33
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:41,236
他身上具备了比我更惊人的
he possesses a far greater faculty

34
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:43,218
观察和推理能力
of observation and deduction than I do.

35
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:47,178
福尔摩斯 我知道你是个谦虚的人
Holmes, I know that you are a modest man

36
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,847
哈哈
Ha-ha.

37
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,411
我亲爱的华生
My dear Watson,

38
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,286
我可不能同意你
I cannot agree with those

39
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:54,684
把谦虚看成是一种美德
that rank modesty among the virtues.

40
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:56,560
对于逻辑学家来说
To the legation,

41
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,166
所有东西该什么样就什么样
everything should be seen exactly as it is.

42
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,523
一个人低估自己
And to underestimate one's self

43
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:01,982
同夸大自己的才能一样
is as much a departure from the truth

44
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,754
只会让他背离真相
as to exaggerate one's own ability.

45
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,316
我所说的关于我哥哥的一切
What I have just told you about my brother

46
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,611
都是准确真实的
is the exact and literal truth.

47
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:10,218
好吧 我当然相信你所说的
Well, naturally, I don't doubt your word.

48
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,928
但如果英格兰真的有另一个
But if there is another man in England

49
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,388
有着如此超凡能力的人
with such singular powers,

50
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,410
那为何警察 公众
how is it that neither the police nor the public

51
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:20,435
甚至包括我 都没听说过他呢?
have ever heard of him, let alone myself?

52
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,396
他在他自己的圈子里颇有名气
He's very well known in his own circles.

53
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:25,752
什么圈子?
Where then?

54
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,566
第欧根尼俱乐部
The Diagones Club.

55
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:31,695
那是伦敦最奇怪的俱乐部
It is the oddest club in London,

56
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:35,134
而我哥哥则是里面最怪的人之一
and my brother one of the oddest men.

57
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:46,810
你肯定很想见见他吧
I suppose you wish to meet him?

58
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,000
那是当然
Well, of course I do,

59
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,212
尽管我只是想证实有这样一个人的存在
even if it's just to prove that he exists.

60
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,092
那么下午你就可以得到答案了
Then you shall, this afternoon.

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,115
他遇到了一个很奇特的案件
He has come across the most singular problem,

62
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,993
而且觉得我会有兴趣
which he thinks might interest me.

63
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,390
但是为什么迈克罗夫
But why does Mycroft not use

64
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,893
不靠他自己超群的推理能力来破案呢?
his great powers for detective work?

65
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,767
如果侦探这门艺术只是
If the art of the detective began

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,436
靠坐在扶手椅上推理就行的话
and ended in reasoning from an arm chair,

67
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,312
我哥哥恐怕要成为历史上
my brother would be the greatest criminal agent

68
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,877
最伟大的侦探了
that ever lived.

69
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,857
我赖以为生的侦探业务
What is to me a means of livelihood

70
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:22,464
对他来说仅是兴趣而已
is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante.

71
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:25,800
他没有此方面的抱负 也没有这个精力
But he has no ambition and no energy.

72
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,970
他的职业是什么?
What is his profession, then?

73
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:32,680
他有着惊人的数字天赋
He has an extraordinary faculty for figures.

74
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:33,618
他帮政府部门
He audits the books

75
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,809
查账
for some of the government departments.

76
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,811
那么这个俱乐部的会员
But what are the qualifications

77
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,271
都是些什么样的人呢?
for the Diogenes Club?

78
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:43,939
有些为人低调 有些愤世嫉俗
Shyness and misanthropy...

79
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:46,130
我哥哥是创始人之一
my brother is one of the founding members.

80
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,839
那里接纳了镇上最孤僻
It contains the most unsociable

81
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,445
和最不爱交际的人 他们从不交谈
and clubful men in time who speak not a word

82
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,948
即使是他人的随意一瞥也会躲开
and shun even the merest glance.

83
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,032
好了 我们进去吧
Now, let us enter.

84
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:56,866
好 但是...
Yes, but...

85
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,118
什么都不要说了
Not a word.

86
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,270
福尔摩斯 你有没有...
Holmes, have you...

87
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:16,305
这里可以说话了
We can talk in here.

88
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,183
噢 谢天谢地
Well, thank goodness.

89
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,322
看那两个人 夏洛克
Look at those two men, Sherlock.

90
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,805
你有什么看法?
What do you make of them?

91
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,366
其中一个是弹子记分员
The brilliant marker of the other.

92
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,514
不错
Precisely.

93
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:44,872
那另一个呢?
What do you make of the other?

94
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,747
应该是一个老兵
An old soldier, I perceive.

95
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:48,414
而且最近心烦意乱
And very recently distraught?

96
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,770
他在印度服役
Served in India, I see.

97
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,332
是个军士
And a non-commissioned officer.

98
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:52,584
我猜 是皇家炮兵队的
Relativity, I fancy.

99
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:53,732
是个鳏夫
And a widower?

100
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,983
还带着一个孩子
With a child.

101
00:07:56,548 --> 00:08:00,508
不止一个 我亲爱的弟弟 是几个孩子
Children, my dear boy, children.

102
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,071
哈哈
Ha-ha.

103
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:04,783
迈克罗夫・福尔摩斯
Mycroft Holmes.

104
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:07,077
很高兴见到你 华生医生
Glad to meet you, Dr. Watson.

105
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,369
自从你为夏洛克作传
I hear of Sherlock everywhere

106
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,350
我到哪都能听到他的事迹
since you became his...

107
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,810
噢 谢谢
Well, thank you.

108
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:15,416
如果谁想研究人类
For anyone who wishes to study mankind,

109
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,709
这就是最好的地方
this is the spot.

110
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:19,481
可你们刚才讨论的东西
But surely you were taking things

111
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,463
也太玄乎了
a little too far just now?

112
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,713
这其实很好推测出 华生
It is not hard to say, Watson,

113
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,381
他的举止
that a man of that bearing,

114
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:25,841
他威武的神情
and especially of authority

115
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,403
风吹日晒的皮肤 一望而知他是个军人
and some big skin as a soldier

116
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,011
而且不是一个普通的军人
is more than a private,

117
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:31,678
而且他刚从印度回来
and is not long for India.

118
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,971
他刚退伍不久还表现在
That is not long since left the service

119
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:37,308
他仍穿着炮兵靴子
shown by his still wearing his ammunition boots,

120
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,768
他们都这么叫的
as they're called.

121
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,375
他走起路来不像骑兵
He has not the cavalry stride,

122
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,251
但是他歪戴着帽子
but he wore his hat on one side

123
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,022
这一点可以从他一侧眉毛上边
as is shown by the lighter skin

124
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,108
较浅的皮肤看出来
on one side of his brow.

125
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,757
他的体重不符合工程兵的要求
His weight is against him being a sapper.

126
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,529
所以他应该在炮兵队
He is in the artillery.

127
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,823
他悲伤的神情
There goes his complete mourning shows

128
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:56,908
表示他失去了某个至亲之人
that he has lost someone very dear.

129
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:58,992
从他自己出来买东西这点看来
The fact that he's doing his own shopping

130
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:00,765
他失去了他的妻子
looks as though it was his wife.

131
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,934
你看 他在给孩子们买东西
He's been buying things for children, as you can see.

132
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:08,374
还有一个拨浪鼓
There is a wrap, which shows that one of them

133
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:10,148
说明有一个孩子很小
is very, very young.

134
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:14,212
而他的腋下夹了一本图画书
And the fact that he has a picture book under his arm

135
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,195
说明还有另外一个孩子
shows there is another child.

136
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:21,929
啊哈 梅拉斯先生来了
Aha, Mr. Merlas.

137
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,160
请进吧 先生
Come in, sir.

138
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,167
这些都是我的朋友
These are my friends.

139
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:37,253
这位是华生医生
This is Dr. Watson,

140
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:41,424
这是我的弟弟 夏洛克
and this is my younger brother, Sherlock.

141
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:44,342
你就是夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生?
You're Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

142
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,156
是我把梅拉斯先生叫来的
I've asked Mr. Merlas to step across.

143
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:49,346
他就住在我楼上
He lodges on the first floor above me,

144
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:52,892
我想你会对他的故事感兴趣的
and I thought you'd be interested in his story.

145
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,332
就是因为他 我才要你今天来的
He's the reason why I asked you to call today.

146
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:57,789
梅拉斯先生
Mr. Merlas,

147
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,126
他来找我...
he came to me, well...

148
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:05,608
我想还是让他自己
But I think I shall ask Mr. Merlas to tell

149
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,320
把他难忘的遭遇
his own very remarkable experiences

150
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,092
告诉你吧
in his own fashion.

151
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:11,760
谢谢你 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

152
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:16,138
这些年来
For many years,

153
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,494
我在伦敦希腊翻译员中
I have been the chief

154
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,475
首屈一指
Greek interpreter in London.

155
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:23,958
警察恐怕是不会相信我所说的事的
I do not think that the police believe my story.

156
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,938
就连我自己都很难相信
On my word, I do not.

157
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:28,961
因为他们以前从未听过这样的事
Just because they have never heard of it before,

158
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,567
他们认为这样的事不可能发生
they think that such a thing cannot be.

159
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,676
但我知道 除非我弄清那个脸上
But I know that I shall never be easy in my mind

160
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,325
贴着橡皮膏的可怜人的遭遇
until I know what has become of my poor man

161
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,244
否则 我的心里是决不会轻松的
with a sticking plastered up on his face.

162
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,537
橡皮...
Sticky...

163
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,352
梅拉斯先生 你坐下说吧
Mr. Merlas, please sit down.

164
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,167
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生 我宁愿站着
Thank you, Mr. Holmes, I prefer to stand.

165
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:53,877
华生
Watson.

166
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,090
我都听着呢
I am all attention.

167
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,761
这一切都发生在两天前
All this happened only two days ago,

168
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:07,639
就是周一晚上
on Monday night.

169
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,349
正如之前说的 我是个希腊人
I am Greek by instruction.

170
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,330
以翻译为生
And earn my living as an interpreter.

171
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:15,872
在一些不寻常的时间
It often happens that I'm sent for at strange hours

172
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,167
常常会有一些有困难的外国人
by foreigners who would get into difficulties

173
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,940
或是晚到的游客
or by travelers who would arrive late

174
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,400
来找我帮他们翻译
and wish my services.

175
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,066
梅拉斯先生
Mr. Merlas?

176
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,525
什么事?
Yes?

177
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,234
我很抱歉现在提出这个请求
I apologize for this intrusion,

178
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,591
但我现在急需
but I need the services

179
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,572
一个翻译
of an interpreter immediately.

180
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,031
我的名字叫拉蒂默
My name is Latimer.

181
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,636
现在就要去?
Immediately?

182
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,721
确实很紧急才来找你的
I wouldn't insist unless it were urgent,

183
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,014
我有个希腊朋友因公事
but a Greek friend of mine has just arrived

184
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,788
刚来到这儿
in this country on business matter.

185
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,664
不幸的是
Unfortunately, he speaks nothing

186
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,226
他只会讲希腊语
but his own tongue.

187
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:34,478
我也只会讲英语
I likewise so.

188
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,147
梅拉斯先生 拜托你了
Mr. Merlas, please.

189
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:38,129
马车已经在外面等着了
My carriage is waiting outside.

190
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,861
很远吗?
How far away?

191
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:46,261
就在肯辛顿
Only to Kensington.

192
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:13,155
很抱歉挡住你的视线了
I'm sorry to have to cut off your view, Mr. Merlas,

193
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:15,240
我不能让你看到
but the fact is, I have no intention that you

194
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,432
我们要去的地方
should see the place to which we are driving.

195
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,662
如果你再找到原路回来
It might possibly be inconvenient to me

196
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,477
我会有小麻烦的
if you were able to find your way back again.

197
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,230
这实在是一种越规的行为 拉蒂默先生
This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. Latimer.

198
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,898
要知道 你的行为
You must be aware that what you're doing

199
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,670
可是违法的
is quite illegal.

200
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,276
毫无疑问 这有点失礼
It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,

201
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,779
但我们会给你补偿的
but we'll make it up to you.

202
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,621
马车行使了将近两个小时
For nearly two hours, we drove,

203
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:49,957
但我丝毫不知道我在何处
without my having the least idea as to where I was.

204
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,084
你注意到
Did you not notice any change

205
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,544
轮子下的声音有什么变化吗?
of sound under the wheels?

206
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,316
我仔细听了 福尔摩斯先生
I listened, Mr. Holmes.

207
00:13:56,734 --> 00:14:00,069
有时候好像走在石板路上
Sometimes we seemed to be on a paved causeway,

208
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,841
有时候又好像是柏油路
sometimes on asphalt,

209
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,177
但都不足以让我判断出到底身在何处
but there was nothing to tell me where I was.

210
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,950
没有其他的声音了吗
And no other sounds...

211
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,389
比如说轮船的汽笛声 或是教堂的钟声?
a ship's siren or church bell?

212
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,474
很抱歉 都没有
I'm sorry, nothing like that.

213
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,309
大约在什么时间
At what time

214
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,602
你们到了目的地?
did you finally reach your destination?

215
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:19,669
8:50
Ten minutes to 9:00, exactly.

216
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:43,693
这位就是梅拉斯先生吗 哈罗德?
Is this Mr. Merlas, Harold.

217
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,632
是的
Yes.

218
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:47,552
做得好 哈哈哈
Well done, Ha Ha Ha,

219
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:48,803
做得好
well done.

220
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:53,912
我们没有恶意 梅拉斯先生
No ill will, Mr. Merlas, I trust,

221
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:57,038
可没有你 我们办不成事
but we could not get on without you.

222
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:01,522
如果你对我们诚实 你是不会后悔的
If you deal fair with us, you'll not regret it,

223
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,857
但如果你耍花招 那就自求多福吧
but if you try any tricks, God help you.

224
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,150
你们想要我做什么?
What do you want of me?

225
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,130
只是向拜访我们的希腊绅士
Only to ask a few questions

226
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,633
问几个问题
of a Greek gentleman who's visiting us,

227
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,508
并告诉我们他的答复
and to let us have the answers.

228
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:16,638
但是你不得多嘴
But, you say no more than you are told,

229
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,870
要不然 小心你的小命
or it were better you had never been born.

230
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:30,086
梅拉斯先生 请继续
Mr. Merlas, pray continue.

231
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,654
好的 然后这个人 恶毒的人
Well then, this man, this evil man,

232
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,303
把我带到了
showed me to a room which appeared to be

233
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,909
一间装修得很奇怪的房间
very curiously furnished.

234
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:49,685
房间的唯一光线来自一盏
But again, the only light was afforded by a single lamp,

235
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,874
拧得很小的灯
half turned down.

236
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,983
拿石板给他 哈罗德
The slate, Harold.

237
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:30,343
给他的手松绑
Are his hands loose?

238
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,460
拿着这个
Take this.

239
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:54,842
你可以问问题了 梅拉斯先生
You will ask the questions, Mr. Merlas,

240
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:57,344
他会把答案写下来的
and he will write the answers.

241
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:00,785
先问他
Ask him, first of all,

242
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,599
他是否准备好在文件上签字
whether he's prepared to sign the papers?

243
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,256
绝不签
"Never. "

244
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,389
没有商量的余地?
On no conditions?

245
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,944
他说 除非我亲眼看到
He writes, "only if I see her married

246
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:14,489
她在我认识的希腊牧师作证下结婚
in my presence by a Greek priest, whom I know. "

247
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,261
哈哈
Ha Ha.

248
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,328
那你知道等着你的会是什么吗?
You know what awaits you, then?

249
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,216
他说 他不在乎自己会怎样
He says, "I care nothing for myself. "

250
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:42,219
就这样
And so it went on, again and again

251
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,095
我不得不再三问他是否
I had to ask him whether he would give in

252
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:45,764
愿意签那份文件
and sign the document.

253
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:50,666
但得到的都是同样的答案
Again and again, I had the same indignant reply.

254
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,251
很快 我就产生了一个想法
But soon, a thought came to me.

255
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,108
我在每次发问时加上自己要问的话
I took to adding on little sentences of my own

256
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,070
起初只是些无关紧要的话
to each question, innocent ones at first,

257
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,675
来试探我身边这些人
to test whether either of our companions

258
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:07,239
是否能听懂希腊语
knew anything of the matter.

259
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:12,036
然后我发现 他们毫无反应
And then, as I found that they showed no sign,

260
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:15,893
我便大胆探问起来
I played a more dangerous game.

261
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:24,859
倔强对你没好处
This obstinacy is doing you no good.

262
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:48,628
他说 我不在乎
He says, "I care not. "

263
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,781
实际上 他还告诉我
In fact, he had also told me

264
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,555
他在伦敦人生地疏
he was a stranger in London.

265
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,725
他说他来这已经三个星期了
He then told me he had been here three weeks,

266
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,227
而且还不给饭吃
and was being forcibly starved.

267
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,919
没饭吃?
Starved?

268
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:17,194
你问出他名字了吗?
Did you manage to find out his name?

269
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,861
克莱蒂特
Cretites.

270
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,364
从雅典来的
He was from Athens.

271
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:25,533
但是很不幸 我只问到这么多
But that was all I could discover, unfortunately.

272
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:26,992
要是再多给五分钟
Another five minutes,

273
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,451
我就可以打探出
and I should have wormed out

274
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,371
这整件事的来龙去脉
the whole story under their very noses.

275
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,227
再问他一遍 梅拉斯先生
Ask him again, Mr. Merlas.

276
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:40,232
就在这时 门开了
But at that instant, the door opened,

277
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:43,986
一个女人走了进来
and a woman stepped into the room.

278
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:46,903
他说 绝不
He says, "never. "

279
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,885
再问他!
Well, ask him again!

280
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:54,827
哈罗德 我再也不能多呆了
Harold, I could not stay away any longer.

281
00:21:54,829 --> 00:22:00,040
索菲亚 索菲亚 索菲亚
Sophia, Sophia, Sophia!

282
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:21,099
好了 梅拉斯先生
That will do, Mr. Merlas.

283
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,458
你看
As you perceive,

284
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:31,314
我们没有拿你当外人
we have taken you into our confidence

285
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,131
才请你参与了我们的私事
over some very private business.

286
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:43,513
这里是五磅金币
Here are five sovereigns, which will, I hope,

287
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,805
我想作为酬劳足够了
be a sufficient fee.

288
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:49,976
但请记住 如果你对任何人透露今晚的事
But remember, if you speak to anyone about this,

289
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:56,648
只要对一个活人讲
one human soul, mind, well,

290
00:22:57,483 --> 00:23:02,903
你的小命可就不保了
may God have mercy on your soul.

291
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,571
和去时一样 我上了一辆封闭的马车
As before, I was taken in a closed carriage

292
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:33,865
行使了大约两小时
for almost two hours.

293
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,746
我被他们丢下车 我才发现
There I was abandoned, as I was later to discover,

294
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,831
那是旺兹沃思荒地附近
near Wentsworth Common.

295
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:01,701
除了刚才对你讲的事情之外
I did not know where I had been,

296
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,307
我既不知所到何地
nor whom I had spoken with nor anything,

297
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,600
也不知和我谈话的是何人
saving what I have told you.

298
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:15,671
但我知道有人在进行肮脏的勾当
But I know there is foul play going on,

299
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,590
我想帮助那个可怜的人
and I want to help that unhappy man...

300
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:21,195
苍天作证 我会的
before God, I do.

301
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:06,128
迈克罗夫
Mycroft.

302
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,942
迈克罗夫!
Mycroft!

303
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:09,984
啊?
Huh?

304
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:12,591
采取什么措施了吗?
What steps have you taken so far?

305
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:16,865
这是登在日报上的
Well, this was in all the daily papers:

306
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,721
"如果有任何人能提供关于
"Anyone having information as to the whereabouts

307
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:21,869
"某不通英语的希腊绅士
of a Greek gentleman

308
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,640
保罗・克莱蒂特的信息
named Paul Cretites,

309
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,457
"当予重酬
who cannot speak English, will be rewarded.

310
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:28,332
"另外 如果您能提供关于
As ever a reward will be paid to anyone

311
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,626
"一位名叫索菲亚的希腊女士的信息
having information about a Greek lady,

312
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:32,815
"也将获得报酬"

313
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,796
但是还没有任何回复
but no answer as yet.

314
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,151
希腊公使馆那边有消息么?
What about the Greek Legation?

315
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:36,985
我问过了
I have tried.

316
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:37,923
他们对此一无所知
They know nothing.

317
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:39,904
那就快发电报给雅典警察局!
The head of the Athens police, then!

318
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,785
夏洛克是我们家精力最旺盛的一个
Sherlock has all the energy in the family.

319
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,287
你要用尽办法把案子查清
When you take up a case, by all means,

320
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:51,268
如果有好消息就告诉我!
let me know if you do any good!

321
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,354
一定
Certainly.

322
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:55,021
梅拉斯先生
Mr. Merlas, sir.

323
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:00,963
如果我是你
I should be extremely careful,

324
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:03,465
我一定会加倍小心
if I were you, but of course,

325
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,238
因为他们一看到这些广告
through these advertisements,

326
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,635
就会知道是你出卖了他们
they'll know that you've betrayed them.

327
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,860
噢
Whoops.

328
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,197
走路当心点
On your way.

329
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:01,219
在我看来 那个希腊姑娘很明显是
It seems to me obvious that this Greek girl has been

330
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,991
被那个叫哈罗德・拉蒂默的年轻英国人
carried off by the young Englishman,

331
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:03,930
给拐骗走的
Harold Latimer.

332
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:05,391
从哪拐骗来的?
Carried off from where?

333
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:06,953
可能是雅典
Athens, perhaps?

334
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,309
不不不 这个哈罗德・拉蒂默
No, no, no... this Harold Latimer

335
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,872
不会讲希腊语
cannot speak a word in Greek.

336
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,645
那个女孩英语讲得很流利
The girl speaks English fairly well,

337
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,876
这么说来 她应该在英格兰待过一段时间
inference that she has been in England some little time,

338
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:16,962
而他没去过希腊
and he has not been in Greece.

339
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,326
谢谢你 杰克森小姐
Thank you Miss Jackson.

340
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:31,660
好吧 那让我们假设那个女孩
Then, let's presume that the girl

341
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:34,371
来英格兰游玩 而那个哈罗德
was visiting in England and that this Harold

342
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,934
劝她和他私奔
persuaded her to fly with him.

343
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,977
这个可能性更大点
That is more probable.

344
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:40,000
然后她的哥哥 应该是她的亲戚
Then the brother, that must be the relationship,

345
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:42,711
从希腊前来干涉
comes over from Greece in order to intervene,

346
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:43,650
他们看到了他
they see him,

347
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,715
用武力强迫他签下一些文件
use violence to force him to sign some documents,

348
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,591
把女孩的财产转移到他们的名下
making over the girl's fortune to them.

349
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:50,947
他可能是财产的受托人
He's probably the trustee.

350
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:55,013
然后 就像我们听到的 他拒绝签字
This, as we have heard, he refuses to do.

351
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:56,160
至今仍不妥协
So far.

352
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,142
那些人不会善罢甘休
But these men will not stop now.

353
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,642
不论发生什么 我们都必须找到他们
Whatever happens, Watson, we must find them.

354
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:01,999
怎么找?
How can we?

355
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,022
如果我们的推测没错
Well, if our conjecture is correct,

356
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:07,627
这姑娘的名字应该是索菲亚・克莱蒂特
and the girl's name is... or was... Sophia Cretites,

357
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:09,818
要找到她应该不难
we should have no difficulty in tracing her.

358
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,633
那是我们的主要希望
That must be our main hope.

359
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,864
因为他哥哥在城里没人认识他
The brother, of course, is a complete stranger.

360
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,363
进来 夏洛克
Come in, Sherlock.

361
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:41,614
进来 先生
Come in, sir.

362
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:44,218
你没想到我有如此精力 是不是 夏洛克?
You don't expect such energy from me, do you, Sherlock

363
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,366
嗯?
...hmm?

364
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:47,451
你是怎么来的?
Now, How did you get here?

365
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:50,788
你们在电报局的时候我赶过了你们
I passed you while you were in the telegraph office.

366
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,705
我登的广告有回复了
I had an answer to my advertisement.

367
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,418
就在你们离开不久
It came within a few minutes of your leaving.

368
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:57,773
有什么消息?
And what effect?

369
00:28:58,295 --> 00:29:02,775
是用宽尖钢笔写在淡黄色纸上的
It is written with a Jay pen on royal cream paper

370
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:06,217
写信人是个身体孱弱的中年男人
by a middle-aged man with a weak constitution.

371
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:10,386
"阁下 鉴于您今天登报所提及的女士
"Sir, in answer to your advertisement of today's date,

372
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:13,409
"我很荣幸告知您
I beg to inform you that I know the young lady

373
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,079
"我对她非常了解
in question very well.

374
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,476
"欲知详情 请到鄙处一坐
If you should care to call upon me,

375
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:19,038
"当能告知
I could give you some particulars

376
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,541
"她过去痛苦的经历
as to her painful history.

377
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:24,564
"她现正在贝克纳姆之默特尔兹
She's at present at Memerkle's Beckinum.

378
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,902
"此致敬礼 杰・达文波特"
Yours faithfully, Jay Davenport. "

379
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,882
是从下布里克斯顿寄来的
He writes from Lower Brigestone.

380
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,591
我们现在何不到那
Do you not think we should drive there now

381
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:33,843
去把详情了解一番?
and learn these particulars?

382
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,511
我亲爱的迈克罗夫
My dear Mycroft.

383
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,595
她哥哥的生命
Her brother's life is more important

384
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:39,368
比妹妹的故事更加重要
than the sister's story.

385
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:41,245
但是我们得先去苏格兰场
But we should call at Scotland Yard

386
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,704
找格雷森警长
for Inspector Gregson

387
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:44,582
然后直接去贝克纳姆
and then go straight out to Beckinum,

388
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,648
要知道 那人的性命正危在旦夕
where we know that a man is being done to death,

389
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,628
我们要争分夺秒
Every hour maybe vital.

390
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,756
要不要顺便去接梅拉斯先生?
Better pick up Mr. Merlas on the way?

391
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:55,320
接他干吗?
Why?

392
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:58,759
因为我们需要一个希腊翻译啊
Because we may need a Greek interpreter.

393
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,260
说得好 华生
Excellent, Watson.

394
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:05,117
据我们所了解到的线索 我得说
I should say from what we have heard,

395
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,786
我们遇到的
that we are dealing with

396
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,080
是个很危险的对手
a particularly dangerous guy.

397
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,908
梅拉斯先生?
Mr. Merlas?

398
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:27,845
什么事?
Yes.

399
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:30,346
楼下有位先生要见你
There's a gentleman downstairs to see you, sir.

400
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,807
哪位先生?
What gentleman?

401
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:33,162
他说是今天和你
Well, he said he met you today

402
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,934
在第欧根尼俱乐部见面的先生
at the Diogenes Club.

403
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,065
福尔摩斯先生 谢谢
Mr. Holmes! Thank you!

404
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:57,765
晚上好啊 梅拉斯先生
Good evening, Mr. Merlas.

405
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:49,786
晚上好 斯特德太太
Good evening, Mrs. Sterd,

406
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:52,704
麻烦你告知梅拉斯先生 我们有要事找他
Would you tell Mr. Merlas I need to see him urgently.

407
00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:54,789
噢 梅拉斯先生现在不在这 先生
Well, Mr. Merlas is not here, sir.

408
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,395
刚刚有位绅士找他一起离开了
A gentleman just called for him, and he left.

409
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,438
你知道他们去哪了吗?
Can you tell me where?

410
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,795
这我可不知道 先生
Oh, I don't know, sir.

411
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:00,836
我只知道
All I know is,

412
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,443
他和那位绅士上了辆马车
he drove off with a gentleman in a carriage.

413
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:04,693
那位绅士有说他的名字吗?
Did the gentleman give a name?

414
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:05,841
没有 先生
No, sir.

415
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:08,341
他是不是一个年轻 英俊的黑大个?
He wasn't a tall, handsome, dark, young man?

416
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,489
噢 不是的 先生
Oh, no, sir.

417
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:12,408
他个子不高 戴着眼睛
He was a little gentleman, with glasses,

418
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:16,475
脸很瘦 但是很有礼貌
thin in the face, but very pleasant in his ways.

419
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,185
他说话的时候一直都在笑呢
He was laughing all the time he was talking.

420
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,436
谢谢您
Thank you.

421
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:25,857
去苏格兰场 快!
Scotland Yard, and hurry!

422
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,868
没有许可证可行不通
It cannot be done without a warrant!

423
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,621
先别管许可证了 长官
We are not disputing that, Inspector.

424
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:46,602
就算他们是罪犯
Even if they are criminals,

425
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:49,208
那也是私人住宅 法律规定...
it is a private house and the law demands...

426
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,649
法律规定我们要快点了
The law demands that we act quickly.

427
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,255
你就不能找个地方法官
Can you not find a Magistrate

428
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:56,923
给我们签张许可证吗?
to sign this warrant for us?

429
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,384
就现在?
A this hour?

430
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,430
就现在
At this very minute

431
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:07,661
要不然绑架案就要变成谋杀案了
our kidnapping could become murder.

432
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:10,998
那我试试吧
I can but try.

433
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,770
请快点
Please do.

434
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:32,265
告诉他 我已经失去理智了
Tell him, I have ceased being reasonable.

435
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,123
如果他还不签字
If he does not sign the papers now,

436
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:39,145
我就杀了他
I will kill him.

437
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:44,045
告诉他 我已经没有耐性了
Tell him I have no more patience.

438
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,892
不
No.

439
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:03,749
不
No.

440
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,692
不
No.

441
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,297
不
No.

442
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:15,215
求求你了 警长
Please, Inspector...

443
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:17,406
非得要许可证吗?
will you not come without a warrant?

444
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:19,386
很抱歉 先生
I am sorry, gentlemen...

445
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,471
我们已经浪费了快一个小时了
We have wasted nearly an hour.

446
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,328
法律可催不得 福尔摩斯先生
The law cannot be hurried, Mr. Holmes.

447
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,977
梅拉斯先生的命
The life of Mr. Merlas

448
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:31,167
现在就掌握在你手中了 警长
is in your hands, Inspector.

449
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:42,634
告诉他 呃 告诉他如果我杀了他
Tell him... hmm... tell him if I kill him...

450
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,284
他妹妹对我也没任何用处了
...I have no use anymore...

451
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:51,182
所以她也得死
...for his sister, and she will die, also.

452
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:53,476
但是你不能...      告诉他!
But you wouldn't...        TELL HIM!

453
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,856
好了 先生们 签好了
Here it is, gentlemen... it's signed.

454
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,001
现在快找个人把我们载到
Now get someone to drive us

455
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,357
伦敦桥站去吧
to London Bridge Station.

456
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,443
但愿还不算太晚
I pray we're not too late!

457
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,242
一辆满载着行李四轮马车
A carriage heavily loaded with luggage

458
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,639
半小时前刚开走
has passed that within the last half-hour.

459
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:10,518
在这里等我们
Wait for us here.

460
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:42,418
贼窝已经空了
The nest is empty and the birds are flown.

461
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,656
是硫磺!
It's sulfur!

462
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:20,991
迈克罗夫 拿着灯!
Mycroft, get the lamp!

463
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:24,429
过来 帮我把他们搬出来
Come, help me with the bodies!

464
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,473
很好!
Right!

465
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,675
快!
Quick!

466
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:47,576
这个可怜人肯定就是保罗・克莱蒂特
The poor wretch must be Paul Cretites.

467
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:50,702
恐怕不再是了 他已经死了
No more, I'm afraid. His life is over.

468
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:53,414
我们应该早点来的 警长
We should have been here sooner, Inspector!

469
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,331
他已经死了大约4个小时了
He must have been dead about four hours.

470
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,833
那些气体是硫磺
The gas made of sulfur,

471
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:00,502
我没说错吧 华生医生?
am I not right, Dr. Watson?

472
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,692
他是被打死的
Beaten to death.

473
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,340
但是梅拉斯先生还活着
But Mr. Merlas still lives.

474
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:09,571
快 赶快把他搬出去
Quick! Let's get him out of here as fast as possible!

475
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:11,240
警长 快去拿白兰地!
Inspector, brandy!

476
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,263
放松 梅拉斯先生 你现在安全了
Relax, Mr. Merlas, you're in safe hands.

477
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:16,348
把他身上的绳索解开
Get the ropes off him.

478
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:40,846
我粗略看了一下那位女士的房间
From a brief look at her room,

479
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:42,202
她已经匆匆忙忙地离开了
the lady left in haste,

480
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,765
但没有打斗痕迹
but without a struggle.

481
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:49,293
那个叫拉蒂默的男人对她肯定还有控制力
That man Latimer must still have some power over her.

482
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:53,567
我想知道
One wonders,

483
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,944
她为了哈罗德・拉蒂默
with how much remorse she abandoned her brother

484
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,507
而抛弃她哥哥会不会懊悔
for Harold Latimer?

485
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:02,219
你还是对妇女抱有偏见?
You still retain your low opinion of women?

486
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,431
在此事上 我可能无法公平看待
In this instance, I cannot maybe justify.

487
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:15,042
福尔摩斯 他们好像查询过列车时刻表
Holmes, they appear to have consulted a Bradshaw.

488
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,004
看这里
Look at this page.

489
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,405
是联运火车
The boat train.

490
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:28,907
凶手走不远的
The murderers won't get far.

491
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:31,303
我可以在英格兰每个港口都派人守着
Have man at every port in England, if need be.

492
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,953
这辆车在伦敦和多佛之间会停一次
The boat train makes one stop between London and Dover.

493
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:41,936
停在霍恩山 23分钟
At Hurn Hill in 23 minutes, precisely.

494
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:44,753
很好 警长 你就陪着这位第一目击者
Exactly. Stay with your chief witness, Inspector.

495
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:46,525
你可能需要给他录份笔录
You may need a statement from him.

496
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,922
而且他需要你的帮助
And he will need your help.

497
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:52,676
让他喝点白兰地和阿摩尼亚
A little brandy, and ammonia at frequent intervals.

498
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:21,361
迈克罗夫! 我可没法跑那么快
Mycroft, I'm not built for running so hard!

499
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,508
请出示你的车票!
Tickets, please!

500
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:04,579
你就不能把票给准备好吗?
Will you kindly have your tickets ready, please?

501
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,633
我叫夏洛克・福尔摩斯
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

502
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,825
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

503
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:14,703
我看过你的破案故事
Well, I've read about your cases, sir.

504
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:15,956
根据验票情况
Are we the last passengers

505
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,627
我们是最后上车的乘客了吧?
from whom you have collected tickets?

506
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:20,445
没错 先生 我一直在火车上工作 从另一头开始
Indeed, sir. I always work at the engine, start there,

507
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:21,907
一路验票到这
and work my way back to the garden.

508
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:22,950
那你就可以帮我了
Then you can help me.

509
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:26,083
有三个乘客 两男一女
There are three passengers, two men and a woman,

510
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:27,230
一起坐车
traveling together.

511
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:28,901
他们也许表现得不像同伴
They may not appear to be companions,

512
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,886
但一定呆在同一间车厢
but they will be in a compartment alone.

513
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:33,703
年纪大点的带着副厚厚的眼镜
The elder man wears thick-lensed glasses,

514
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:35,478
年轻的那个长的很英俊
and the younger one is quite handsome.

515
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,626
他们带了很多行李
They will have a great deal of luggage

516
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,670
上面有前往欧洲的标记
marked for the Continent.

517
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,131
你有见过他们吗?
Have you seen such a party?

518
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:42,054
有见过 我可以帮你 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, indeed, I can help you, Mr. Holmes.

519
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,517
我就知道
I never doubted it.

520
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,290
火车上有两组人
There are two parties

521
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,065
符合你的描述 福尔摩斯先生
who fit that description, Mr. Holmes.

522
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,110
两组?
Two?

523
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:49,989
请出示你的车票
Ticket, please.

524
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,461
在B4号房间
In Compartment B4...

525
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,026
B4      还有D8
B4.        ...and D8.

526
00:41:58,028 --> 00:41:59,489
谢谢你 乘务员
Thank you, Inspector.

527
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:03,038
你怎样知道哪两个是凶手?
How do you know which two are the murderers?

528
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:07,318
再简单不过了 不 别吵醒他
It couldn't be simpler. No, don't wake him.

529
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,032
我们两个去就行了
There's danger enough for the two of us.

530
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:35,191
有一个是来自代佛德的左撇子出版商
A left-handed printer from Detford.

531
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:38,739
他的哥哥喝多了
His older brother drinks too much

532
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,932
而且还有肝病
and is pained by his liver.

533
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:43,229
不是我们要找的
Can't harm mine then.

534
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:44,795
是啊
Whatever.

535
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,442
那这个女孩呢
And the girl?

536
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:56,694
她不认识这两个男的
She knows neither of them,

537
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:58,155
她是个布拉福德的机械师
she's a machinist from Bradford

538
00:42:58,157 --> 00:42:58,991
是去度假的
who's going on a Holiday

539
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,453
顺便寻找爱情
to find romance.

540
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:02,957
这些都说明
Which means, undoubtedly,

541
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:05,568
凶手不在B4
the murderers aren't in Compartment B4.

542
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,594
谢谢你 克莱蒂特小姐
Thank you, Miss Cretites.

543
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:50,248
坐着不要动 拉蒂默先生 进来吧 华生
Do sit still, Mr. Latimer. Do come in, Watson.

544
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:07,785
你究竟是谁?
Who the hell are you?

545
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:10,498
还有一个人不在这里
The third member of the party is absent,

546
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,483
但我肯定他会回来的
but I'm sure he will return.

547
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:46,096
克莱蒂特小姐 我能问你个问题吗?
Miss Cretites, may I ask

548
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,914
是这个男人绑架你还是你自愿跟他走的
if you are this man's prisoner or companion?

549
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,273
什么都不要说
Don't say anything.

550
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:53,299
他们没有权利问你任何问题
They have no right to ask you anything at all.

551
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:56,327
如果他们是警察的话 早就自报家门了
If they were the police, they would have said so.

552
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,414
为什么是警察呢 拉蒂默先生?
Why the police, Mr. Latimer?

553
00:44:58,415 --> 00:45:00,189
难道你知道他们会来?
Were you expecting to meet them?

554
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:03,634
听着 我不知道你到底是谁
Look, I don't know who you are,

555
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:06,453
我也不知道你是怎么知道我的名字的
nor do I know how you know my name,

556
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,644
但我正和我的未婚妻
but I'm traveling with my fiancee

557
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:10,629
前往欧洲 准备在那结婚
to the Continent to get married.

558
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,507
所以 麻烦你们离开好吗?
So, would you please leave us alone?

559
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:15,117
要不然 我就要叫警卫了
Otherwise, I shall be obliged to call a guard.

560
00:45:15,222 --> 00:45:16,056
那你就叫吧
Please do.

561
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:18,562
我肯定华生乐意代为效劳
I'm sure Dr. Watson would do it for you.

562
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:25,139
啊 想必你是知道我是谁了
Ah, I see you know who I am?

563
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,643
那么 我能否
Then may I be permitted to ask

564
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:31,403
再问你未婚妻一次呢?
your fiancee the question again?

565
00:45:32,238 --> 00:45:34,115
他说得没错
It's true what he said.

566
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:35,996
我们是要去结婚的
We are going to be married?

567
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,457
去哪?
Where?

568
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,337
雅典
In Athens.

569
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:40,902
恐怕去不了了
I fear not.

570
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:42,571
谁敢阻挡我们?
And who is going to stop us?

571
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,137
如果警察不阻止 我也会
If not the police, then I will.

572
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:47,374
克莱蒂特小姐 你真的是
Miss Cretites, do you seriously want me to believe

573
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,671
自愿离开英格兰的吗?
that you are leaving England willingly?

574
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:51,550
是的
Yes.

575
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:54,264
为了嫁给这个谋杀了你哥哥的男人?
To marry the man who has just murdered your brother?

576
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:55,411
那不是真的
That's not true.

577
00:45:55,413 --> 00:45:58,753
不 谋杀?
No! Murdered?

578
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:00,632
这不是真的 对吗?
It isn't true, is it?

579
00:46:00,737 --> 00:46:03,032
他身体康复后会尽快来希腊和我们会合
He's going to meet us in Greece as soon as he's well.

580
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,597
你是这样对我说的
That's what you said to me.

581
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,685
他会的 索菲亚 他会的
And he will Sophia, he will.

582
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,400
你哥哥死了 克莱蒂特小姐
Your brother is dead, Miss Cretites.

583
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:10,862
别听他胡说
Don't listen to him.

584
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:14,516
我在贝克纳姆的房子里发现了他的尸体
I found his body myself in the house in Beckinum.

585
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,109
他被杀死了
He had been murdered.

586
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:20,570
被折磨致死的
tortured to death.

587
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:23,075
不 这不是真的
No, it can't be.

588
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,955
哈罗德 告诉我 到底怎么回事?
Harold, tell me what's happened!

589
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:27,565
至于你 拉蒂默先生
As for you, Mr. Latimer,

590
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:29,756
梅拉斯先生还活着
Mr. Merlas is alive

591
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:33,202
作为证人他将亲眼看着你被绞死
as a witness to see you hanged.

592
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,333
救我 索菲亚 救我!
Help me, Sophia, help me!

593
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:03,579
救我! 救我!
Help me! Help me!

594
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:42,308
...那很不错 非常好
...went very well, very well indeed.

595
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:45,545
我有朋友死了
I have friends dead.

596
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:49,511
我想不用我多说了
Yes, but I need not elaborate,

597
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:52,121
在我看来 你是个阅历丰富的人 对吗?
as I see you are a man of the world, sir?

598
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:55,462
相反
On the contrary...

599
00:47:55,463 --> 00:47:57,968
我从未离开过英格兰
I've never left England in my life.

600
00:47:58,594 --> 00:47:59,428
真的吗?
Haven't you?

601
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,472
没有
No.

602
00:48:01,308 --> 00:48:04,439
那么先生 如果你一定要选一个国家
Then sir, if you must choose one country,

603
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:06,318
那就选希腊
it must be Greece...

604
00:48:06,424 --> 00:48:11,643
众神之岛 还有橄榄枝和阴谋
the land of Gods, olives and intrigue.

605
00:48:13,105 --> 00:48:15,819
那是我的目的地 希腊
It is my destination, Greece.

606
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:19,054
那你会说希腊语吗 先生?
Do you speak Greek, sir?

607
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:23,335
不会 但我们能找个好翻译啊
No, but one can always find a good interpreter.

608
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,614
谢谢
Thank you.

609
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,642

615
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,477
有时候我会忘了自己有多重
Sometimes, I forget my size.

616
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,619
再见了
Goodbye again.

617
00:49:13,547 --> 00:49:15,530
保罗的事是真的吗?
Is it true about Paul?

618
00:49:16,783 --> 00:49:18,348
是的 我很抱歉
I'm afraid so.

619
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,133
我恨哈罗德・拉蒂默
I hated Harold Latimer.

620
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:29,936
我恨他 同时我也爱他
I hated him, and I loved him.

621
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,589
我愿意做他要我做的任何事
I would have done anything he said.

622
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:36,826
我愿意和他去任何地方
I would have gone anywhere with him.

623
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:40,479
即使他杀了你哥哥?
Even though he murdered your brother?

624
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:46,221
是的
Yes, even then.

625
00:49:51,023 --> 00:49:52,484
凯纳先生
Mr. Cana,

626
00:49:53,216 --> 00:49:54,990
我们正等着你呢
we were expecting you.

627
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:05,429
这是你的左轮手枪吧 先生?
I believe this is your revolver, sir?

628
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:36,536
我亲爱的哥哥...
Well, brother of mine...

629
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:39,042
我们似乎走上了犯罪的道路了
we seem to be heading down the path of crime.

630
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:40,712
我唯一想走的
The only path I intend to take

631
00:50:40,714 --> 00:50:43,635
是去往第欧根尼俱乐部大门的路
is the door to the Diogenes Club,

632
00:50:43,636 --> 00:50:45,932
你们可别跟来
which I will close behind me.

633
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,596
她会怎样?
What will become of her?

634
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,998
问几个问题就没事了
After questioning, nothing.

635
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,397
她虽冷血 无情
There's not a crime to her cold heart,

636
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,114
但还构不上犯罪
and not a single shred of compassion.

637
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
