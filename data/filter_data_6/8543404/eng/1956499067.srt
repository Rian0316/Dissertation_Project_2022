00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:11,735
And how much involvement

177
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:12,997
do you think you'd like?

178
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,608
It's hard to say.
I travel a lot.

179
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,697
But I come through New York
twice a year, so...

180
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,655
you know, maybe twice a year.

181
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,050
Okay. Uh, and what's
the traveling about? Work?

182
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,486
No, I'm homeless.

183
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,270
Okay. Okay.

184
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:28,012
- Okay, cool.
- Awesome.

185
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,014
Oh, stop pretending that
doesn't throw you a little bit.

186
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,451
I mean, maybe...
maybe a little bit.

187
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,931
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes. Is-is it...

188
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,934
Wait, so...
so, who's the father, Karla?

189
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,370
A guy I met on the street.

190
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,676
Yeah, um, he's a good man.

191
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,373
Our paths cross
every once in a while,

192
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,201
but, you know,
ultimately not a match.

193
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,291
He wants to settle down
somewhere. Not me.

194
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,816
- What do you think that's about?
- I don't know. I mean,

195
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,121
I don't have
any mental problems.

196
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,167
I'm just, um...
I just don't like being

197
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,082
in one place for too long.

198
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,301
Oh. Can I have a muffin?

199
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,868
Thanks.

200
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,044
Yeah, and, you know,
I-I follow the sun.

201
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,916
Oh, like a...
like a James Taylor song.

202
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,570
And houses make me feel
claustrophobic.

203
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,441
I think they're a trap we build
for ourselves, like...

204
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,269
like cars and smartphones.

205
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,837
Things we think make us smarter
but actually make us more dumb.

206
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,708
I think traveling,
you see a new city

207
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:14,668
every week, you totally get
to reconnect with the country

208
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,670
and the people
that made it great.

209
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:19,150
Instead of just watching it
through a TV.

210
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,717
Thank you.

211
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,068
Can I borrow your spoon?

212
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah.

213
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,639
Hey. Hey. Let me...
let me help you with that.

214
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:31,075
Oh. Thanks.

215
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,208
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. Whoa.
- You okay?

216
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,862
[chuckles]
Yep. What's in here?

217
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,124
It's just my world.

218
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,778
[objects clinking]

219
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,214
Hello, darling. Hello, baby.

220
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,824
- I got you a little treat.
- [chuckles]: Oh.

221
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,652
- Your dog?
- This is. This is Homer.

222
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,088
He goes everywhere I go.

223
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,612
Yeah, is that good?

224
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,439
- Hi...
- Want to say hi? -Hi.

225
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,485
Homer, say hi. Say hi.

226
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
- Hi.
- [chuckles]: Hi.

227
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,707
- So, are we doing this?
- Wait-wait.

228
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,665
Don't you want to know if we,
like, own our apartment?

229
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,363
Or-or-or, uh, how much
we take home a year?

230
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,844
- What colleges we went to?
- Are we on a contract?

231
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,933
- That's a popular one.
- No. No, I don't care

232
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,196
about any of that stuff. I just
want to see that you're in love.

233
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,546
I think you are.

234
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,286
- Give me that.
- Uh...

235
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,810
Well, it's not always
happy families with us,

236
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,289
I-it frequently
descends into, uh,

237
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,248
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

238
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,207
Sure. Okay, so I'm gonna go back
to Trina, and say that I think

239
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,296
I found a match, and then,
if we all agree to this,

240
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,081
I'm gonna continue my travels
for, like,

241
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,865
the first two trimesters,
and then come back to the city.

242
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,519
Um, yeah, here's my number.

243
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,697
Oh. Okay.
Thank you so much.

244
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,308
It was a real experience
meeting you.

245
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,093
This is a really good thing.

246
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,661
You guys are good people,
and my baby boy

247
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,185
or girl would be privileged
to be looked after

248
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,014
by a couple like you.

249
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,755
Yeah. Bye.
Thanks for lunch.

250
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:44,366
Come!

251
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,628
Bye.

252
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,460
ANDY: So is she good
crazy or bad crazy?

253
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,810
TOBIN: I don't know.
I'm not sure she knows what she's doing.

254
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,247
But you do know that we advocate
for everything

255
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,553
- she's talking about?
- Yeah.

256
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,424
Uh, capitalism gone crazy, fear,

257
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,165
- traps of our own making...
- Right, I like that about her,

258
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,776
but she's taking it
a little far, right?

259
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,735
What? [scoffs]
By actually living it?

260
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,520
- [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, kind of. Yeah.
- Okay...

261
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,000
All right, come on, Kipper,
take a shit already.

262
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,133
Don't put her under pressure,
all right?

263
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,787
- It makes her nervous.
- Okay, whatever...

264
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,963
I'm just saying, we don't know
anything about this girl

265
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,573
or-or what she's going through.

266
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,531
How do we know that
she won't just... come on...

267
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,795
she won't just change her mind
when she sees the baby?

268
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,579
It just feels really intrusive.

269
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,018
Two creepy gays messing with
some young kid's pregnancy.

270
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,499
- Just... Let's just leave it.
- [laughs]

271
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,370
Leave it alone. We're not
supposed to be parents.

272
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,807
We're not parents
and that's all right.

273
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,243
This is a gift, okay?

274
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,637
It's not some poor woman
that's been coerced

275
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,639
by circumstance into having
our child,

276
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,337
or bringing a new child
into this fucking hellhole.

277
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,992
This is happening either way.
Okay?

278
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,689
And we get to be there
to catch it.

279
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,649
No, it just feels like a hell
of a lot of time

280
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:53,653
to spend on something
that may not even happen.

281
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,743
And it's a hell of a lot of
disappointment, for us,

282
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,092
if she changes her mind.

283
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,137
And that's perfect.

284
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:04,141
We get to live something
that we actually believe.

285
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,013
Yeah.

286
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:09,494
- Hey, baby, my baby, my baby.
- [chuckles]

287
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:14,238
- [gasps] Yes, good girl!
- [gasps] Miracle! Good girl!

288
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,371
- Here you are.
- Why is it always me

289
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,416
- that cleans up?
- 'Cause. It's your dog.

290
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,680
- It's our f... it's ourdog.
- Okay, it's our dog,

291
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,290
- but it's your shit.
- It's our shit.

292
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,075
- It's not our shit. Aw...
- Our shit. Good girl.

293
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,555
- Okay. Okay.
- Thank you, honey.

294
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,078
- Can you open the gate, please?
- I can open the gate.

295
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,427
- Thank you so much.
- Why do you have an attitude?

296
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,690
- I really appreciate that...
- You don't need to

297
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,126
- have an attitude.
- I don't have an attitude.

298
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,170
- I'm just asking very simply.
- I feel like you got...

299
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,694
Considering I've got shit
in my hand,

300
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,478
- I would not be talking to me...
- It's your dog.

301
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,175
- In an abrasive manner.
- You can have shit in your hand.

302
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,568
- Thank you.
- Okay, honey. You know what?

303
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,701
It's fine, I want to watch
Fargo. Is that okay?

304
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,224
- You can watch whatever you want.
- Okay. Thank you.

305
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,793
Oh, come on, are you... are you...
are you, like, four years old?

306
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,492
[buzzer trilling]

307
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,455
- Hey! Welcome!
- Hi!

308
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,109
Oh, both of you!

309
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,197
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

310
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,852
- Hey.
- Three of you. Jesus Christ.

311
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,332
- Look at you.
- Come in.

312
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,986
You beat the rain. You know,
a big summer storm is due.

313
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:06,987
- I got that. I got... Oh!
- Thanks.

314
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,728
- Oh, oh!
- You okay?

315
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,120
Uh, yeah, sorry,
I just grabbed it...

316
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,992
- Yeah, thank you.
- TOBIN: You okay?

317
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,341
Homer! Bad dog!

318
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,778
[growling, barking]

319
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,041
Your dog seems a little
threatened by Homer.

320
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,826
He can get very territorial.

321
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,698
Wow. A territorial dog
with no territory.

322
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,308
He makes everywhere
his territory.

323
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,789
Homer! Hit the deck.

324
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,403
So, thanks for this, guys.
I love your apartment.

325
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,015
- I'm-I'm really excited to stay.
- Oh, you're staying?

326
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:38,583
- In-in-in New York?
- Of course she is.

327
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,976
She's staying with us.
[chuckles]

328
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,067
Oh. Oh. Um, oh. Cool. Great.

329
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,547
Is that okay?
Have you guys discussed that?

330
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,983
- We're discussing it right now.
- No.

331
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,680
- It's a live discussion.
- It's okay.

332
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,639
It's great. And you're only
a couple of weeks out, right?

333
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:53,120
- You're gonna pop any day, huh?
- I'm eight weeks out.

334
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,296
- Eight weeks. Eight weeks.
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,038
- Great.
- ANDY: We are happy to have you.

336
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,648
It just makes us feel involved.

337
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:03,957
Yeah. Andy has been preparing
for parenthood like crazy.

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,393
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- [clears throat]

339
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,265
So I've, um, I've turned Tobin's
study into a baby room,

340
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,441
and I've painted it half blue,

00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:49,537
How's Andy?

671
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,018
We're giving him liquids,
you know. He's stable.

672
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,368
[chuckles]
Funny.

673
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,370
- I thought you'd be the fainter.
- [laughs]

674
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,939
- Yeah, so did I.
- But you weren't.

675
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:03,594
You stayed there
and held my hand

676
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:07,294
and helped clean up the blood
and cut the cord.

677
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:11,124
It was so amazing,
seeing her head emerge, and...

678
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:15,563
And I like that I was
the first guy to see her.

679
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,740
I-I can't wait to hold her.
What was it like?

680
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,960
It was beautiful.

681
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,831
Can you take that hat
off your head?

682
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,966
- You look ridiculous. [laughs]
- [chuckles]: I'm sorry.

683
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,186
But yeah, it was beautiful.

684
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,536
So have you thought about
reconsidering the whole thing,

685
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,973
since seeing her?

686
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,236
Why, are you getting cold feet?

687
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,934
No. No, the opposite.

688
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,372
I want it now. I love her now.

689
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:46,463
Just like that, so I can't
imagine how you must be feeling.

690
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,815
I'm just saying,
if-if you've changed your mind,

691
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,600
that is... i-is,
I totally get it.

692
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:56,038
We're just happy to,
to get you here, you know?

693
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,478
Yeah. Well, um...
[clears throat]

694
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:04,264
That's nice of you to offer.

695
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,008
Yeah, I mean...

696
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:14,013
Mine isa world of one.
You were right about that.

697
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,058
I do have issues.

698
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:19,322
I will smoke skunk and sleep
with guys I don't know.

699
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,760
And I just don't know
how to say no.

700
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:25,285
I never have. If something comes
my way, I just let it happen.

701
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:29,071
And I love the road,
I feel safe there, but...

702
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,900
it's no place for a kid.

703
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:37,079
And maybe being a mother
will change me, but...

704
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:43,346
I can't take that risk with her
if it doesn't.

705
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,392
I've been irresponsible
my whole life.

706
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,221
This is the first responsible
thing that I've done.

707
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:54,575
You know, I can't, I can't stand
being around people

708
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:58,622
for more than a few days, but...

709
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,669
I forgot about that
for the last few weeks...

710
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:07,196
'cause you guys are the most
amazing people in the world.

711
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,242
Yeah.

712
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:11,679
You guys are gonna be
the best parents ever.

713
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,165
- Well... we'll try.
- [chuckles softly]

714
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,384
[sniffles]

715
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,517
Thank you so much.

716
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,867
[crying]

717
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,130
- [laughs]
- [laughs]: Stop.

718
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,916
My God...

719
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,887
[baby fusses softly]

720
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,856
[chair clatters softly]

721
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,779
Hey.

722
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,092
Uh, I want to tell you a story
about your mom.

723
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:20,835
And I'll tell you now,
when you can't talk back,

724
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,448
and you're not all...
teenage and entitled,

725
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,538
uh, and in case
you don't get to see her

726
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,280
as much as you want in life.

727
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:36,938
Which would be a shame,
because, I am telling you now,

728
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:41,812
she is fucking... awesome.

729
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:45,381
She carried you like a trooper,

730
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:50,996
and she gave birth to you
without one moment of fear.

731
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:58,612
I know, um, you're gonna ask me
about why-why she's not around.

732
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,660
A long time ago,
before there were cities,

733
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:07,577
human beings used
to constantly move.

734
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:10,450
They were hunter-gatherers,
and their lives were tough,

735
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:14,671
and-and relentless,
but they were also kind of free.

736
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,587
Well, your mom is,

737
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:20,851
is kind of like,
like a hunter-gatherer,

738
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:25,030
but a little bit
born in the wrong time.

739
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,771
So, she can't take you with her,

740
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:31,819
because this society
wouldn't support that.

741
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:34,343
So you get to hang with us
for a, for a while.

742
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:39,131
Now, we're not hunter-gatherers,
by any means.

743
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,002
We're capitalists.

744
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:45,224
We wouldn't survive a second
in the wild because...

745
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:49,532
there's no restaurants
or Whole Foods,

746
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:54,929
or therapists or hospitals
for when you get sick

747
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,541
or, um, books for you to read
or movies for you to watch.

748
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,196
Nothing. And we like
those things, right?

749
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,853
So you stand to have a-a pretty
good time with us, right?

750
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,855
JUNE:
Mybook.

751
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,684
- Huh?
- My book, Daddy, stop it.

752
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:14,731
- Story time is for her, not you.
- Sorry.

753
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:16,472
But it's so good, right, June?

754
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,084
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What was I saying?

755
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,737
About cattle pips.

756
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:24,350
[chuckles]: About... about...
about capitalists.

757
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,960
- Yes. About...
- About capitalists.

758
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,745
- [chuckles]: Capitalists, yeah.
- That's nice.

759
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,747
- I get ice cream?
- Yeah, you do.

760
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,401
And other people make
the ice cream for us,

761
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,099
which is great, right?

762
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,665
- Mommy likes ice cream, too.
- She does?

763
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,233
Yeah, last time,
we got two ice creams.

764
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,192
She gave you...?
Mommy gave you two ice creams?

765
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,541
- Yeah.
- Last time? Two?

766
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,151
- Mm-hmm.
- For such a young child?

767
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:44,674
- [chuckles softly] Okay.
- Okay.

768
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,981
But ice cream's nice, right?

769
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,852
Well, maybe not, maybe not two,

770
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,681
but ice cream is okay,
just not two.

771
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,118
Lot of sugar.

772
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,728
- Okay, we're gonna go to sleep?
- Yeah.

773
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,164
All right, go to sleep.

774
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,253
Eyes closed.

775
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:01,691
[whispers]:
Begin sleeping.

776
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,607
Okay, come on, close your eyes.

777
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,044
[whispers]:
