1
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:51,081
- What is it today, sir?
- The Ministry.

2
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:54,683
All morning on Health
Service administration.

3
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,202
A chap just now on the radio

4
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:01,485
said the trouble with health,
education and transport

5
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:04,844
is that people in Government
go to private hospitals

6
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,124
and send their kids to private schools!

7
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,847
Comedy programme, was it?

8
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,999
And go to work in chauffeur-driven cars!

9
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:18,360
Think there's something in it, sir?

10
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:21,758
If you and Sir Humphrey went
to work on a number 27...

11
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:23,246
Quite impracticable!

12
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:27,923
We work long enough hours as it is,
without having to wait at bus stops.

13
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,762
- You'd need more efficient buses.
- Certainly would.

14
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,964
Yes, that's what he was saying.

15
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:39,966
Same with the Health Service.
You a member of BUPA, sir?

16
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:43,563
- Anything on the radio, Roy?
- "Yesterday in Parliament".

17
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,285
Don't bother...

18
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:48,837
<i>Mr Lanford, opposition
member for Birmingham,</i>

19
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:52,124
<i>asked the Administrative
Affairs Minister, James Hacker,</i>

20
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:55,802
<i>about reducing administrators
in the Health Service.</i>

21
00:01:56,447 --> 00:02:00,963
<i>We have already
achieved a reduction of 11.3%</i>

22
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,357
<i>in administrative staff</i>

23
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:06,803
<i>and are actively pursuing
further economies.</i>

24
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:10,846
<i>Would you explain
how his assurance to the House</i>

25
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:15,922
<i>squares with this minute
from his own department?</i>

26
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,716
<i>Then Mr Lanford
dramatically produced a paper.</i>

27
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:23,766
<i>I quote, "If
admin staff were reclassified</i>

28
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,918
<i>"from administrative to technical..."</i>

29
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,237
<i>"...and the comparison changed
from the financial to calendar year,</i>

30
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:37,686
<i>"then the figures will
show a fall of 11.3%. "</i>

31
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,442
<i>Would the Minister care to
comment on this shabby deception?</i>

32
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:45,286
Bit of a googly, sir.

33
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:49,603
<i>I... er... I... erm...</i>

34
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:54,079
<i>I have no knowledge of the
document you're brandishing.</i>

35
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>I shall give the
file reference to the Minister</i>

36
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:04,325
<i>in exchange for an assurance
of a full independent enquiry.</i>

37
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:08,963
<i>I will give that assurance.</i>

38
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:13,086
<i>The House read the
Scottish Fisheries' Bill...</i>

39
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:16,683
That's a bit rough, innit?
"A full independent enquiry"!

40
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:22,085
- You were dropped in it there.
- I think I got away with it.

41
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,479
Lucky they didn't ask you
about that new hospital, sir.

42
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:31,562
They finished it 15 months ago,
and it's still got no patients.

43
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,366
The DHSS can't afford to staff it.

44
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,440
It's got staff, 500 administrators.

45
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:40,802
- Just no patients.
- Who told you?

46
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:44,357
My mate Charlie, a driver
for the Health Secretary.

47
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,118
- I'm appalled!
- So am I.

48
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,164
The incompetence of it!

49
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:54,841
I can't think what came over you.

50
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,520
I beg your pardon!

51
00:03:56,687 --> 00:04:01,363
- A full independent enquiry.
- Humphrey, that's not what I meant.

52
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:04,644
- But you mentioned incompetence.
- Yours, Humphrey, yours!

53
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,045
- Mine?!
- You dropped me into it?

54
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:13,042
We can't foresee a small omission
from the brief, but a full enquiry?!

55
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:17,166
I don't want an enquiry, but if
you're drowning and thrown a rope...

56
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:20,080
That wasn't a rope, it was a noose!

57
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:22,442
You should've stood up for the department!

58
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,599
I prepared thoroughly for
yesterday's Question Time,

59
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:31,717
but nowhere was the suggestion you'd
juggled the figures so I'd mislead the House!

60
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:36,802
You wanted the figures reduced?
So we reduced the figures!

61
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:41,438
- Yes, but not the administrators.
- Of course not.

62
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:46,476
- That's not what I meant. -
Minister, one isn't a mind-reader!

63
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:50,003
- You said reduce them, so we did.
- And another thing:

64
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,635
How did this get out? Another leak?

65
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,804
This isn't a department, it's a colander!

66
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:01,324
How can we govern responsibly,
if backbenchers get all the facts?

67
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:06,322
- The enquiry gives us some
time. - So does a time-bomb!

68
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,126
- Is there a disposal squad?
- Disposal squad?

69
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:13,121
Couldn't we get the independent
enquiry to exonerate us?

70
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:18,480
- Do you mean rig it?
- No, no, no, no!

71
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,239
Well... yes.

72
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,246
Minister!

73
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,561
It depends on who the chairman is.

74
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:29,037
- He absolutely has to be sound.
- Sound?

75
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:34,600
He will know what is required.
He will perceive the implications.

76
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,476
He will have a sympathetic
insight into the problems.

77
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:41,525
In short, he will be "sound".

78
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,439
You mean... bent?

79
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,598
No, of course not!

80
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,918
He will be a man of broad understanding...

81
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,760
How about... a retired politician?

82
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,600
...and unimpeachable integrity.

83
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,962
Yes, I see what you mean.

84
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:59,243
- A businessman?
- Oh, really!

85
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,365
- An academic?
- No, no, no.

86
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:07,601
- Who've you got in mind?
- Perhaps a retired civil servant.

87
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,646
- Good thinking, Humphrey.
- Sir Maurice Williams.

88
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,957
Might not he be too independent?

89
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:18,040
- Well, he's hoping for a peerage.
- Not through this?

90
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:22,041
No, but the right finding
will earn him Brownie points!

91
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,961
- Brownie points?!
- They all add up towards the badge!

92
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:30,484
- Well, Sir Maurice it is.
- Thank you, Minister.

93
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,161
Thank you... Brown Owl.

94
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,646
Oh!

95
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,157
Good morning, Bernard.

96
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:43,397
- Two points... the Cuban refugees.
- Not that again?

97
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:46,923
It's about our refusal
to do any more for them.

98
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,875
It's not my fault, it's the
Treasury. You can't beat the Treasury!

99
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,844
I shall say nothing.

100
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:58,525
One more public humiliation and I'll
become a political refugee myself!

101
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:03,078
- And the other point?
- The alleged empty hospital.

102
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:07,206
As I warned you, the driver's
network is not wholly reliable.

103
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:10,279
- Roy's wrong.
- Thank heavens for that!

104
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:14,235
- How did you find out?
- The private secretaries' network.

105
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:15,726
And?

106
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:20,597
In fact, there are only 342
administrative staff at the hospital.

107
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:25,158
The other 170 are porters, cleaners,
laundry workers, cooks, etc.

108
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,885
And medical staff?

109
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,117
Oh, none of them.

110
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:32,321
- None?
- No!

111
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,285
We are talking about St Edward's Hospital?

112
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,200
Yes. It's brand-new
and fully-staffed.

113
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,086
Unfortunately, there were cutbacks,

114
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,205
so there was no money
for medical services.

115
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:48,076
A hospital with over 500
non-medical staff and no patients?

116
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:50,283
- There's one patient.
- One?

117
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:54,645
The deputy administrator fell
over scaffolding and broke his leg.

118
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,365
Good God!

119
00:07:56,527 --> 00:08:00,645
Thank heavens I wasn't asked
about this! Why hasn't it got out?

120
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:04,004
It's been contrived to
look like a building site,

121
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,318
and so far no one's
realised it's operational!

122
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,763
You know, scaffolding,
skips, the normal thing?

123
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,916
Normal?! I'd better look at
it before the opposition does.

124
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,363
Yes, it's surprising the
press haven't found out.

125
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:21,360
Fortunately, most journalists
are so incompetent,

126
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,121
they wouldn't know today is Wednesday.

127
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,245
It's actually Thursday, Minister.

128
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,922
Let's sit down there.

129
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,920
Why is your Minister
interested in this hospital?

130
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:40,716
He's greatly concerned
that it has no patients.

131
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,640
- It takes all sorts.
- Yes.

132
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,923
- Evening.
- Good evening.

133
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:51,876
How can there be patients
when it has no nursing staff?

134
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:56,516
- Thank you.
- Splendid.

135
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,962
- Sir Humphrey?
- Thank you.

136
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:05,445
We've found at the DHSS that it
takes time to get things going.

137
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:11,323
First of all, you have to sort out
the smooth running of the hospital.

138
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:15,275
Having patients around
would be no help at all.

139
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,281
They'd just be in the way.

140
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:23,885
- Tell him this is the run-in
period. - Yes, yes, the run-in period.

141
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,804
How long is the run-in
period going to last?

142
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,845
My Minister's agreed to
an independent enquiry.

143
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:35,205
- You know what I think about that.
- Yes, I know, but...

144
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:40,961
...we are going to get some
patients into St Edward's...

145
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,439
...eventually?

146
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,039
Aren't we?

147
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,198
It's possible.

148
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,765
Certainly our present intention.

149
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,838
In a year or two.

150
00:09:56,767 --> 00:10:00,919
Probably... when the financial
situation has eased up a bit.

151
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,520
Not till then?

152
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,965
How can I open 40 new wards
when I'm closing everywhere else?

153
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:12,121
- Treasury wouldn't wear it.
- My Minister may want to shut the place.

154
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,482
Impossible! What about the unions?

155
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,445
- Are the unions active there yet?
- Good point.

156
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:25,999
Remember that firebrand
agitator at Southwark Hospital?

157
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,565
Billy Fraser, odious man. Could be useful.

158
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,366
Time he was moved on.

159
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:41,398
The Health Service is an advanced
case of galloping bureaucracy!

160
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,479
Oh, certainly not galloping!

161
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,957
A gentle canter at the most.

162
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:53,245
- Instances flood into this office.
- From whom, Minister?

163
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:56,683
MPs, constituents,
doctors, nurses, the public.

164
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,678
Trouble makers!

165
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,645
- The public?!
- They're the worst.

166
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,640
Listen to this.

167
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
"Stethoscope requisition:
Due to current situation,

168
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:11,120
"it is not possible to issue the
extra stethoscopes applied for.

169
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:17,476
"We can, however, supply longer
tubes for your existing stethoscopes."

170
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:21,956
- Well?
- Doesn't that strike you as odd?

171
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,085
- If they have long tubes...
- No, no.

172
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,717
No, not longer stethoscopes,
MORE stethoscopes.

173
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,560
If they had really long tubes,

174
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:36,642
the doctor could stand in one
place and listen to all the chests.

175
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,523
What about nurses' uniforms?

176
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,838
"Apparently the latest
consignment of nurses' coats

177
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:50,359
"is made of a see-through
material; nurses issued with these

178
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:55,078
"are requested to report to the
Director of Uniform Surveillance

179
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:59,798
"who will assess the
extent of the problem."

180
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:04,358
- Nice work if you can get it.
- Humphrey, I'm serious!

181
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:10,640
"Please note that the soft toilet
rolls are for patients not staff.

182
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:15,597
"It would appear that staff have
been using the soft toilet rolls

183
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,440
"for one reason or another."

184
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:24,239
"St Stephen's Mortuary will
be closed over Christmas.

185
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:27,604
"During the holiday, medical
staff are to cooperate

186
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,759
"in keeping pressure off this department."

187
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,596
A very civil and reasonable request.

188
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:40,399
You think the rest of the year
doctors work hard to keep it busy?

189
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,765
These are a few isolated examples.

190
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:49,206
The Health Service is as efficient
as the Government allows it.

191
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,279
Nonsense! The figures
speak for themselves.

192
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:57,475
In ten years, the number of
administrators has risen by 40,000.

193
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:01,083
The number of hospital
beds has fallen by 60,000.

194
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:07,243
The annual cost of the Health
Service has gone up by £1.5 billion!

195
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:11,400
If only British industry
could match this growth record.

196
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:15,446
You think spending more
money on fewer patients

197
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,041
so we can employ more administrators

198
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,041
is a good way of spending
the taxpayer's money?

199
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,526
Certainly.

200
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:27,362
This money is solely to
make sick people better.

201
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,405
No, no, no, Minister.

202
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,127
It is to make everybody better.

203
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:37,644
Better for showing the extent
of their care and compassion.

204
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:43,086
You see, when money is allocated
to the Health or Social Services,

205
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,637
Parliament and the
country feel... cleansed.

206
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,242
Purified. Absolved. It is a sacrifice.

207
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:53,284
Dreadful claptrap!

208
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:59,525
After the sacrifice, nobody questions
what happened to the offering.

209
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:05,637
- The public does care if it's misspent.
- They care it's not seen to be misspent.

210
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:11,006
That's not true. Look at the uproar
over mental hospital scandals.

211
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,044
My point exactly.

212
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:16,722
Those abuses had been
going on happily for years.

213
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:20,880
Nobody was concerned what was
being done with their money.

214
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:25,438
- What outraged them was being told!
- A cynical smokescreen!

215
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:30,920
Do we not agree there's no point in
a hospital run solely for the staff?

216
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:36,081
- That's not how I would express it.
- It's how I would.

217
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,238
Indeed.

218
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:42,717
- How would you express it?
- At the end of the day,

219
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:46,004
one of a hospital's prime
functions is patient care.

220
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,486
One?

221
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:51,560
Until we have the money for
nursing and medical staff,

222
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:55,766
it's a function we can't
pursue. In 18 months or so...

223
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,124
- 18 months?
- ...we can open some wards.

224
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,642
No, it's got to be now.

225
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:06,277
I suppose we could form an
inter-departmental committee

226
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,564
to examine the feasibility
of monitoring a proposal

227
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,400
for admitting patients earlier.

228
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,884
- How long would that take to report?
- Not long.

229
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:19,483
How long? About 18 months...!

230
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:23,802
I suggest we get rid
of all the staff there

231
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:28,483
and use the money to open
closed wards in other hospitals.

232
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:34,040
When we can afford it, we open
St Edward's with medical staff.

233
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:37,995
Do that and you'll delay the
opening for patients for years.

234
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,523
You talk as if the
staff have nothing to do!

235
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,042
- What do they do?
- Really, Minister!

236
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:47,279
There's a large number of
extremely busy departments.

237
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,122
Firstly, the Contingency Department
for fires, strikes, air raids,

238
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:54,597
nuclear war, epidemics,
food or water poisoning.

239
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:58,806
In such a crisis, the hospital
is a key centre for survival.

240
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,640
Then, the Data and Research Department,

241
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:06,278
conducting a full-scale demographic
survey of the catchment area.

242
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:09,917
We have to anticipate the future
requirements for maternity,

243
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:14,126
geriatrics, paediatrics
and the male/female balance.

244
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,359
Thirdly, there's Finance
- projected accounts,

245
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,280
balance sheets and cash-flow budgets.

246
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:25,567
Then, the Purchasing Department
for purchasing medical equipment,

247
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:29,959
examining estimates, looking
at price lists and catalogues...

248
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,004
Purchasing what?

249
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,725
Everything, Minister.

250
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:37,846
Everything from brain scanners
to Brasso! May I continue?

251
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,326
Be briefer.

252
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,325
Would that I could, Minister,
but you need to understand.

253
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,365
Fifth, the Technical
Department for evaluations.

254
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:51,884
Sixth, the Building Department
dealing with Phase 3 plans,

255
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:57,041
costing and so forth for the final
phase to be completed by 1994.

256
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:00,040
Then, there's Maintenance,
Cleaning and Catering,

257
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:04,246
Personnel in charge of leave,
National Health Insurance, salaries,

258
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:09,561
as well as staff welfare officers
to look after the 500 employees.

259
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,605
- And finally, Administration.
- Administrators!

260
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,156
More administrators administrating
other administrators!

261
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,887
This is important work, Minister.

262
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,722
The typing pool, stationery,
office furniture and equipment.

263
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:26,802
- Liaison between departments.
- Are you being serious or not?

264
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:31,245
- What do you mean?
- There are NO patients!

265
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:34,479
That is what a hospital's for. Patients!

266
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:37,559
Ill people! Healing the sick!

267
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:43,404
But all these vital tasks must
be done with or without patients.

268
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,998
Why?

269
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,805
- Why?
- Why?

270
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,202
I don't understand.

271
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,086
How else can I express it? Why?

272
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:58,920
Would you sack the army
because there's no war?

273
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:02,921
Completely different! A
hospital must produce results.

274
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:08,719
We don't measure our success
by results but by activity.

275
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:13,244
Those 500 people are seriously overworked!

276
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:19,283
The full establishment should be 650.

277
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,881
May I show you the paperwork?

278
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,278
No, Humphrey. Enough is enough. Sack them!

279
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,799
Out of the question, Minister.

280
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,482
We need administrators or
the hospital will never open.

281
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:36,117
- Sack the ancillary staff.
- The unions won't wear it.

282
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:41,156
Sack half and use the money
to get doctors and nurses,

283
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,682
and open some wards!

284
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:47,681
No, Humphrey, that's my
last word. My last word!

285
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,917
You may go!

286
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:55,559
Very well, Minister. I shall
have a word with the unions.

287
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:00,082
- But I don't hold out much hope.
- Go!

288
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,763
That seems to be everything.
Thank you for coming.

289
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,966
Thank you very much.

290
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,083
Very good meeting.

291
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:21,478
- Got time for a drink?
- A quick one.

292
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,207
The usual? Make yourself at home.

293
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,766
Thank you.

294
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:35,236
What are we going to do about St Edward's?

295
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,477
St Edward's Hospital?

296
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:41,322
Not much of a case. Can't fight you on it.

297
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:44,197
What do you mean?

298
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:49,600
We realise you can't keep ancillary
staff on in an empty hospital.

299
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,965
Isn't that a bit defeatist?

300
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,923
What?

301
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:59,682
- Surely, you can stick up for them?
- You want us to...?

302
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,964
It's not just your workers, you know?

303
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:08,565
The 342 civil servants must
have some workers to administer.

304
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:13,562
- Civil servants are never laid off.
- We live in disturbing times.

305
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:19,202
You mean, if we take industrial
action, you'll support us?

306
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,677
My dear Brian, I am
the Permanent Secretary.

307
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,805
My task is to turn the
wheels of government.

308
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:29,357
I couldn't possibly
countenance any such action.

309
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:36,357
But... if there were effective
opposition from the ancillary workers,

310
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,246
the civil servants would have to stay.

311
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:40,965
And the Minister?

312
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:45,518
The Minister doesn't know
his ACAS from his NALGO.

313
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,280
I haven't got much of a case.

314
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:57,599
Hospital empty for 15 months,
wards not open for another year.

315
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:01,965
Pull yourself together. Think of
your members' wives and children.

316
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,164
Their... cats... budgies!

317
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,761
They're resigned to it by now.

318
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:12,042
Is Billy Fraser resigned to it?

319
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:15,195
Yes... but he's over at Southwark.

320
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,965
Do you want to bet?

321
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:20,806
You mean...?

322
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:27,326
Well, that's a different matter,
with some real shop-floor militancy.

323
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,763
You see? Unity. Solidarity.

324
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:34,485
- Thanks for the drink.
- Thank you, Brother.

325
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:39,038
Please give my kind regards
to our fraternal comrades.

326
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:46,403
<i># We shall not We shall not be moved #</i>

327
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:13,396
Minister, this is Mrs Rogers,
the chief administrator.

328
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:17,719
- Nice to meet you.
- Billy Fraser, committee chairman.

329
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:22,563
- How nice to meet you.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

330
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,845
This is 'F' ward.

331
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:53,685
And this is 'J' theatre.

332
00:22:56,327 --> 00:23:02,880
- How much did all this cost? - With
radiotherapy... two and a quarter million.

333
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:08,758
- It's appalling it's not used!
- No, a very good thing in some ways.

334
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:12,522
Prolongs its life,
cuts down running costs.

335
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:14,803
But there are no patients!

336
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,640
But essential work has to go on.

337
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:20,367
Aren't patients essential work?

338
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:24,202
Running an organisation
of 500 people is a big job.

339
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:27,882
But if they weren't here,
they wouldn't be here!

340
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:30,117
This is wrong. It won't do.

341
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,359
Either get some patients or I'll close it.

342
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:38,476
- Well, in the course of time...
- Not in the course of time. Now!

343
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:44,040
Get rid of 300 staff, get some
doctors and get some patients!

344
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:48,439
Without those 300 people this
hospital wouldn't function!

345
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,643
And it's functioning now?

346
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:55,005
Minister, it's one of the
best-run hospitals in the country.

347
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,965
It's up for a Florence Nightingale Award.

348
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:02,757
- What, pray, is that?
- "The Most Hygienic Hospital".

349
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,763
I've said my last word. 300 staff must go.

350
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:12,684
- 300 jobs lost?!
- Surgery with a skeleton staff?!

351
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:17,796
Don't do any surgery. Do varicose
veins, piles... Do something!

352
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:21,721
- You mean 300 jobs lost?!
- Yes, I do.

353
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:25,596
A hospital is a place
for healing of the sick!

354
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:30,045
It's employment for my members,
and you want to sack them.

355
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,801
Is that your compassionate society?

356
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,959
Compassionate to patients
rather than your members!

357
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,721
We'll come out on strike.

358
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,762
Very well, do that.

359
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:46,478
Who can it harm? Do, please!
Strike, the sooner the better!

360
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:51,960
Take the administrators with you.
Then we shan't have to pay you.

361
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:05,879
- How about a drink before home?
- Yes. Thank you, Minister.

362
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:10,325
- That went well at the hospital.
- Yes, Minister.

363
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:13,843
- I wasn't standing any argument.
- No, Minister.

364
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:18,364
Threatening to strike! Played
right into my hands. Cheers!

365
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:21,325
Aren't we missing the news?

366
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:28,523
<i>Our diplomatic correspondent
says the US is pressuring the UK</i>

367
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:31,076
<i>to take Cuban refugees.</i>

368
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:33,522
<i>The Government has made no comment.</i>

369
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,564
Got no money.

370
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:42,360
<i>All workers in London hospitals are
to go on strike at Friday midnight.</i>

371
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,647
Right... What?!

372
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,401
<i>A row has blown up at St Edwards</i>

373
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:52,924
<i>over the proposed laying-off
of 170 ancillary workers.</i>

374
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:55,555
<i>We spoke to activist Billy Fraser.</i>

375
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:58,719
<i>We're striking against unemployment.</i>

376
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:02,243
<i>We can bring London's hospitals

377
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:07,563
<i>There'll be no blood transfusions,
no cancer treatment, nothingl</i>

378
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,639
<i>Till we have the compassionate society.</i>

379
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:15,881
<i>- How can you do this to patients?
- It's Mr Hacker that's doing it.</i>

380
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:20,359
<i>But you're inflicting terrible
sanctions on the innocent public.</i>

381
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:25,726
<i>I'd like to take this opportunity
to assure the general public,</i>

382
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:30,278
<i>every stone will be left unturned
in a search for a settlement.</i>

383
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:36,765
Have you seen the news? You
said you'd talk to the unions!

384
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:41,205
- What are we going to do?
- We have a more serious problem.

385
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,598
Sir Maurice's independent
enquiry about the department.

386
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,883
It's unfavourable to us.

387
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,117
You said he was sound!

388
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:53,326
I know, but he's also working as chairman

389
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,126
of the Refugee Resettlement Committee.

390
00:26:56,287 --> 00:27:00,599
There are more Brownie points
for refugees than enquiries!

391
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,485
Precisely, Minister.

392
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:05,605
We've no money to re-house the refugees.

393
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:08,687
- Minister?
- I don't want to talk!

394
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,997
It's Number 10...

395
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,400
Hello, Ji...

396
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,159
Yes. Quite.

397
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:19,646
I see.

398
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,037
Not at all. Thank you.

399
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,996
They've seen Fraser on the news.

400
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,000
They want a peace formula soon!

401
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:34,800
Sir Maurice says he'll be satisfied
only if the UK will house 1,000 refugees.

402
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:39,483
But we haven't the money.
Or for 1,000 hospital beds...

403
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,242
- How many refugees?
- 1,000.

404
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:47,479
1,000 refugees? 1,000 beds!

405
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:53,085
Minister, that hospital is for
sick British not healthy foreigners!

406
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:56,637
- There's a huge waiting list.
- Didn't you just say

407
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,686
Sir Maurice's enquiry was
likely to come down against us?

408
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,919
- That's a...
- That what you want?

409
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,801
I see your point, Minister.

410
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:12,483
Bernard, reinstate all
the workers at St Edward's.

411
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,957
Tell Sir Maurice we can
offer a new hospital,

412
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,721
with accommodation for 1,000 refugees.

413
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:22,926
Tell the press it was my decision
and that everybody's happy.

414
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:27,126
- Do want to give a quote, Minister?
- Why not? Say...

415
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:31,838
"It was a tough decision,
but a necessary one.

416
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:37,966
"If Britain is to retain the name of..."

417
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:41,802
- "The compassionate society"?
- Thank you.

418
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,720
"...the compassionate society." Got that?

419
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:47,321
Yes, Minister.
