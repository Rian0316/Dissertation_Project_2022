Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,938
听说过啊
‭Yeah.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,473
就是卖点周边 找几个没名儿的四线明星去撑撑场子
It's a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,560
其实根本没什么人会去 你问这个干什么?
and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?

5
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:13,562
他们邀请我去签名
I got asked to sign autographs there.

6
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,981
这么棒!
That's awesome!

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,533
是 "杀人恶猿" 那部电影吗?
Is this for Serial Ape-ist?

8
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,152
可能是猴子电影
Well, it could be for the monkey movie.

9
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,820
也可能是我那个痔疮药的广告
It could be my hemorrhoid commercial.

10
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,121
毕竟我也没别的作品了
The list does not go on.

11
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:25,373
- 动漫节是什么时候?  - 管它呢
- When is it?  - It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:25,985
我才不去
I'm not doing it.

13
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,376
为什么不去啊?
What? Why not?

14
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:28,877
你自己说的 去的人都是没名儿的四线明星
You just said yourself, it's sad.

15
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,212
是啊 不过还没到可悲的地步
Yeah, but it's not pathetic.

16
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,080
我觉得做人 只要不可悲就行了
That's where I draw the line.

17
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,716
来嘛! 会很好玩的
Come on! We'll have fun.

18
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:35,884
我也不知道
I don't know.

到时候会有一群书呆子围着你转
You'll have nerds fawning all over you.

20
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,672
要是这都吸引不了你 那我们的婚姻岂不是个笑话
If you don't love that, this marriage is in trouble.

21
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,924
大概 见见粉丝也没坏处吧
I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans

22
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:44,426
还能挣点外快
and make a little extra money.

23
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,894
是啊
Yeah.

好吧
All right, fine.

47
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:44,293
就算
Let's say that

我们要请人来家里玩
we were to entertain people.

49
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,379
你想怎么玩?
What type of gathering did you have in mind?

00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,664
聚餐吗? 那么 是吃午饭?
Huh? A meal? Lunch?

51
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,582
早午饭? 还是晚饭?

或者一起喝下午茶? 是正式的那种吗? 嗯?

是有鸡尾酒的聚会?
Is it a cocktail party?

微波炉食品聚会餐?
A Tupperware party?

00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,808
对了... 还是说你想开一个惊喜派对?
Ooh, yeah... is it a surprise party?

57
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,010
不过最好可别是
Oh, I hope it's not

58
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,678
传说中的 "西海岸派对" 因为歌里说
a West Coast party, 'cause according to

59
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,315
西海岸的派对根本停不下来
the man on the radio, a West Coast party don't stop.

60
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,234
我的锅 我不应该提这事 对不起
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

61
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,852
别这么说啦 你负责提建议
Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up,

62
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,488
我负责否决 这就是团队合作嘛
I knock them down. That's called teamwork.

63
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:23,365
它在踢我
That's a kick.

64
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,034
真的在踢我
That's an actual kick.

65
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,708
你干什么呢?
What are you doing?

66
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,843
我感觉宝宝在踢我
I felt a kick.

67
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:37,880
你肚子里有个孩子
There's a baby in there.

68
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:41,183
是嘛 原来我放肚子里了啊
Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.

69
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:44,270
我是说 我知道你怀孕了
Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant.

70
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:45,521
但是...
I just...

71
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:48,390
我从来没意识到 怀孕就是
never connected the idea of pregnancy

72
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:51,977
你肚子里有个真的孩子了
and you actually having a baby.

73
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,781
你真的是麻省理工毕业的?
Which MIT did you go to?

74
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:02,488
天啊 我们还没准备好迎接这个孩子啊!
Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house!

75
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,740
没有婴儿床 没有尿布
We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers.

76
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,241
也没做婴儿防护措施
We're not baby-proofed.

77
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:10,079
路上随便一个人都能到我们家来掀马桶盖!
Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!

78
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,498
Howie 我们有的是时间慢慢做准备呢
Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.

79
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,916
是嘛?
Do we?

80
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:15,084
你看看你
Look at you.

81
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,003
Willy Wonka马上就要把你推进榨汁间了
Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.

82
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,003
{\an8} "查理的巧克力工厂"电影中有专门榨果汁的房间

83
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:22,391
现在我也想踢你了
The next person kicking you will be me.

84
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:23,342
快睡吧
Good night.

85
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,817
我们这附近有好学校么...?
Are we even in a good school...?

86
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,018
嗷!
Ow!

87
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:37,606
我警告过你了 不怪我
I warned you, and I did it.

88
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,112
这都是什么?
What's all this?

89
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:45,698
这些都是给你的签名会准备的材料...
Oh, everything we need for your autograph session...

90
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,333
你的海报 还有马克笔
head shots, markers. 

91
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,034
Lenard 你准备的这么齐全是挺好的
Okay. Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this,

92
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:52,171
但是只要有一个人要我的签名 那就是奇迹了
but it'll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.

93
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,339
你开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding?

94
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,624
我曾经花了20刀买Theo Sassler的签名
I once paid $20 for Theo Sassler's signature.

95
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,875
- 那是谁?  - 我也不知道
- Who's that?  - Oh, I don't even know.

96
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:59,678
只是觉得他的名字挺好听的 Theo Sassler!
I just liked his name. Theo Sassler!

97
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,514
来来来 给你看这个
Oh, and look at this.

98
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:04,717
我还准备了找零神器
I even got a change maker.

99
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,773
小美女 想换多少零钱啊?
How much change you want, little lady?

100
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:15,394
讲真 我现在想换的可不只是零钱
Oh, there's so much I want to change.

101
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:19,114
你要是想换1刀的硬币 尽管来找我
Yeah, well, if it's a dollar, you're in luck.

102
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,821
这是什么情况?
What's going on here?

103
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:28,540
你说你想邀请别人来家里做客
You expressed an interest in having people over,

104
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,043
我觉得我反对的太快了
and I feel I dismissed it too quickly.

105
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,411
所以 我亲自动手
So, I took matters

106
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,164
准备了早午餐 还邀请了几个人过来
into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.

107
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,999
你太好了
Well, that's so nice.

108
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,500
都有谁要来啊?
Who's coming?

109
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,637
Stuart 地质实验室的Bert
Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab,

110
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,972
还有楼下的Petrescu太太
and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

111
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,674
你是说住在二楼的那个罗马尼亚女士吗?
You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?

112
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:46,675
是的
Yes.

113
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,010
有个有意思的事:
Oh, fun story:

114
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,345
她是跟十个兄弟姐妹一起长大的
she grew up with ten siblings.

115
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:53,098
也有可能是跟企鹅 她的英语简直穷凶极恶
Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.

116
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:56,151
这组合还挺怪的
That's an odd mix of people.

117
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,020
这是我们第一次作为主人招待别人
Well, for our first time hosting,

118
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,656
我觉得实施一次试验还挺明智的
I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run.

119
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:01,940
你知道的 就好像那次
You know, like how I practiced

120
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,492
我去万圣节鬼屋之前
for that Halloween haunted house

121
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,862
用公交车站的卫生间来做练习一样
by going into the bathroom at the bus station.

122
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,248
但你后来也没去那个鬼屋啊
You never went into that haunted house.

123
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,500
你也没看见车站里跳出来吓我一跳的东西
You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.

124
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:14,420
好吧 谢谢你 Sheldon
Well, thank you, Sheldon.

125
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:16,455
这是个有趣的惊喜
This is a fun surprise.

126
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,424
而真正的惊喜是
Oh. Well, the real surprise is

127
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:21,009
你对于我擅长惊喜表示惊讶
how surprised you are that I'm great at surprises.

128
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,961
可是那完全不是惊喜啊
Well, that's not a surprise at all.

129
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,180
我是说 如果我知道你擅长惊喜的话
I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises,

130
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:26,381
那我就会对这个惊喜有所预料
I would have expected the surprise,

131
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:27,766
从而不为它而感到惊喜了
and therefore not have been surprised.

132
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,051
但正是因为我得到了惊喜 所以我不知道你擅长惊喜
But as it is, I didn't know,

133
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:32,187
所以我对此表示的惊讶就不应该让你感到惊讶
and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.

134
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,140
别让我变得这么欲火难耐 客人都要来了
Don't get me all randy. Guests are on the way.

135
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,946
嗨
Hi.

136
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,481
嘿 你们刚刚去哪儿啦?
Hey, where you been?

137
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:44,817
哦 我们刚刚去为宝宝买了点东西
Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.

138
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,702
等你看到我们买到的婴儿床就知道了
Wait till you see the crib we found.

139
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,821
你们没经过我就自己买了个婴儿床?
You bought a crib without me?

140
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:50,489
- 你会喜欢的  - 真的
- You're gonna love it.  - Yeah.

141
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,990
它是市场上评价最高的一款
It's the highest rated one on the market.

142
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,325
我都不会管它叫婴儿床
I wouldn't even call it a crib.

143
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:56,745
我会叫它宝宝专用孤独堡垒
I'd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.

144
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,248
听上去很贵啊
Sounds expensive.

145
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,916
好吧 我可能是
Okay, well, I may have gone

146
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,086
有点花过头了 但是安全是无价的嘛
a bit overboard, but you can't put a price on safety.

147
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,506
不过假如真想标价 它后面的零比你想象的要多
Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.

148
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,092
但是这是能买到的最安全的婴儿床了
But it's the safest crib you can buy.

149
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,094
而且如果你不喜欢的话 我们还可以把它退回去
And if you don't like it, we can return it.

150
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,012
- 好吧  - 用我们新买的小面包车退
- Fine.  - In our new minivan.

151
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:16,181
哎呀 午饭是什么啊?
Hey, what's for lunch?

152
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,900
你买了辆小面包车?!
You bought a minivan?!

153
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,935
是为了宝宝嘛 而且我也没买
It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.

154
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,353
车行把它借给了我
The dealer loaned it to me

155
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,489
说我有24个小时试驾
for a 24-hour test drive.

156
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,574
不过车后备箱被婴儿床磨得挺厉害的
Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib,

157
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,276
所以你们可能要买辆小面包车了
so you might have bought a minivan.

158
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,580
我可不想开那个 那也太妈妈款了
I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.

159
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:33,248
可是车行的人说
The guy at the dealership said

160
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
这种车已经不再是只为妈妈专用的了
they're not just for moms anymore.

161
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:36,285
可是讲道理
Then again,

162
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,787
他也确实以为你是我老公
he did think you were my husband.

163
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:42,958
他们在做超声波的时候都这么想
They thought it at the ultrasound.

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,843
车行这么想有问题吗?
Why not at the car dealership?

165
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:53,302
我以前从没在桌子的这半边待过啊
Never been on this side of the table before.

166
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:55,521
我觉得自己大权在握
I feel powerful.

167
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,972
真的吗?
Really?

168
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:01,026
我觉得我像是在为了队里的新制服卖糖果
I feel like I'm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.

169
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:04,062
好吧 那一张黑白的签名海报是4.75美金
Okay, so it's $4.75 for a signed black-and-white

170
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,314
然后彩色的是9.95美金
and $9.95 for a color.

171
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:07,482
对 为什么不直接用五块和十块啊?
Right. Why not five and ten bucks?

172
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:10,319
可是我带了我的找零神奇啊 让我嘚瑟嘚瑟嘛
Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.

173
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,405
哎呀 那个人看过来了
Hey, that guy's looking over here.

174
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,990
你觉得他会是你的第一个顾客吗?
Oh. You think he's your first autograph?

175
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,159
我不知道 高冷一点 他过来了 他过来了
I don't know. Be cool. He's coming. He's coming.

176
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,661
- 嗨!  - 嗨
- Hi!  - Hi.

177
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:20,913
我大爱你的电影
I love your movie.

178
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,247
谢谢
Well, thanks.

179
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,832
那绝对得是我平生看过的
It has got to be one of the worst things

180
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,500
最烂的东西之一
I've ever seen in my life.

181
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:28,420
你的爱简直让我困惑
Your love confuses me.

182
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:31,638
你想要张签名照吗?
Would you like an autograph?

183
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,508
好呀
Sure.

184
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,346
好嘞 你想让我把它写给谁呢?
Okay. Who do I make it out to?

185
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,344
给Daniel
Daniel.

186
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:35,644
- 行  - 我必须得问问
- Okay.  - I have to ask.

187
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,396
你当时是故意往差了演
Were you trying to be that bad,

188
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,348
还是你就真的是个烂演员呢?
or are you just a terrible actress?

189
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,818
这话也没能解开我的困惑
That did not clear things up.

190
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,856
一共4.75
That'll be $4.75.

191
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,524
不用找了
Keep the change.

192
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:51,693
可是我...
But I... Oh.

193
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,002
刚刚那完全算不上好啊
Nothing about that was good.

194
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,870
没错
Mm-mm.

195
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,374
这没什么可怕的 Sheldon
There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.

196
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,929
软木塞的平均速度可是有25英里每小时呢
The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour.

197
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,929
{\an8}25英里/时≈40公里/时

198
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,848
如果这个速度在学校周围都算是太快了的话
If that is too fast around a school,

199
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,017
那它在厨房里也肯定太快了
it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.

200
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,721
可是已经过去15分钟了
Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.

201
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,607
好吧 我行的
Okay. I can do this.

202
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,058
给我点时间...
Just give me a moment...

203
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,063
含羞草鸡尾酒来了
Mimosas coming up.

204
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,198
我曾经把一罐橙汁放在冰箱里放了太久
I once left orange juice in my fridge so long,

205
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,151
导致喝起来也像含羞草鸡尾酒
so it tasted like a mimosa.

206
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,237
那得放了多久了啊?
How old was it?

207
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,738
这很难说啊
It's hard to say.

208
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,157
我喝了它以后就不记得了
I don't remember much after I drank it.

209
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,878
你要来一杯吗 Petrescu太太?
Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?

210
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,715
是的 喝酒是为了乐趣和好朋友 这是Applebee说的
Yes. Drink is fun and good friends-- Applebee's.

211
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,715
{\an8}Applebee是美国一家连锁餐厅

212
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,970
她的英语是从电视上学的
She's learning English from TV.

213
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:55,090
电视很好 你继续吧
TV, good. Now back to you.

214
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,510
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

215
00:08:58,512 --> 00:08:59,561
嗨 Stuart
Hi, Stuart.

216
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:00,762
这个是给你的
These are for you.

217
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,898
哦 它们真漂亮 谢谢你
Oh, they're pretty. Thank you.

218
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,267
Stuart 这是加州理工学院地理实验室的Bert
Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab,

219
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,736
这个是住在楼下的Petrescu女士
and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

220
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:08,437
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,771
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hey.

222
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,106
所以说 我错过了什么?
So, what did I miss?

223
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:13,442
呃 我们看Sheldon开瓶子
Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle

224
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,444
开了十五分钟
for 15 minutes.

225
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,916
十五分钟可以给你的汽车保险打八五折
15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.

226
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:27,005
还有谁要来吗?
Anybody else coming to this thing? Uh...

227
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,749
- 你叫什么名字?  - Jeff
- What's your name?  - Jeff.

228
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:38,669
好
Okay.

229
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,837
我最喜欢的部分是你洗澡那一幕
My favorite part is your shower scene.

230
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,707
今天已经听过好多遍了
Been hearing that a lot today.

231
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,675
我还把它做成了我手机的屏保
I even have a screen grab on my phone.

232
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,595
没错 咪咪在那呢
Yep, there they are.

233
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:51,047
嗯 换下一个吧
Okay, let's keep it moving.

234
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,717
给你
Here you go.

235
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,218
我应该打他一拳
Should've punched that guy.

236
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,137
那去吧 他就在那呢
Well, go ahead. He's right over there.

237
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,106
为什么要说出来? 就不能让我展现一下雄风?
Why do you do that? Can't you let me have my moment?

238
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,193
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hi.

239
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,444
我喜欢你的电影
I like your movies.

240
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,130
谢谢你!
Thank you!

241
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:06,397
我两部都看了
I saw both of them.

242
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,064
我猜我们还是在讨论电影
I assume we're still talking about the movies,

243
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,734
但这一天下来 谁知道呢
but after today, who knows.

244
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,153
我可以和你拍一张合照吗?
You think I could get a picture of us?

245
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:13,954
哦 当然
Oh, sure.

246
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,038
还有 呃 你能不能
And, uh, could you be

247
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,072
亲我一下?
giving me a kiss?

248
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,123
不 她不能亲...
No. She cannot kiss...

249
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,658
你们这些人都什么毛病?!
What is wrong with you people?!

250
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,627
- Leonard...  - 不 不 不 这一点都不好
- Leonard...  - No, no, no. It's not okay.

251
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,208
你是谁?
Who are you?

252
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,468
我是他丈夫
I'm her husband.

253
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,383
你才不是呢
No, you're not.

254
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:28,585
我就是
I am.

255
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,420
对 他真的是
Yeah, he really is.

256
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,507
我才不信
No.

257
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:40,347
它有后置摄像头 还有DVD播放器
It's got a rearview camera, there's a DVD player,

258
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,232
看看这个
oh, and check this out.

259
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,070
感觉我们就像是住在未来一样
It's like we're living in the future!

260
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,439
嘿 给她演示后备箱! 给她演示后备箱!
Hey, show her the trunk! Show her the trunk!

261
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,860
想象一下 你一只手抱着孩子
Imagine this: you've got the baby in one hand,

262
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,746
另一只手拎着菜 你在想
groceries in the other, and you're thinking,

263
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:59,499
"我怎么才能把后备箱打开呢?"
"How am I gonna open this trunk?"

264
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:02,118
我可能会想 "我的丈夫呢
I'm probably thinking, "Where's my husband,

265
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,504
他为什么不来帮我?"
and why isn't he helping me?"

266
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:07,791
如果你只用脚踢一下就能开后备箱的话
You don't need my help when you can open the trunk

267
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,676
你都用不着我帮忙
with a simple kick of the foot.

268
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,385
不 你弄错了 要温柔地踢
No, it's a gentle kick; you're doing it wrong.

269
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,103
来 把东西都给我
Here. Give me those.

270
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,529
是不是要绕一个圈?
Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,368
那人以为你们是一对儿真是太奇怪了
It's weird that guy thought you were a couple.

272
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,320
- 太棒了!  - 是啊!
- Yes!  - Yes!

273
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,405
看到了吗?
See?

274
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,374
多简单 再看看这么大的储物空间
Easy. And look at all this cargo space.

275
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,409
这样吧 把婴儿床拿出来
You know, we'll get the crib out

276
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,327
你就可以试驾了
and you can take it for a test-drive.

277
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,164
我告诉你 这个商务车会是...
I'm telling you, this van is gonna be...

278
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,501
你后背受伤了吗?
Oh, is it your back?

279
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,253
嗯... 是的
Uh... yeah.

280
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,474
没事 我们上车吧 看看GPS
Anyway, let's just get in and see if the GPS

281
00:11:57,476 --> 00:12:00,009
能不能把我们带到最近的急救室去
can take us to the nearest emergency room.

282
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,014
所以直到Amy的公寓修好前
So until Amy's apartment is fixed,

283
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,734
我们都要一起住在这
she and I are living here together.

284
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,319
我之前也和我女朋友住在一起
I lived with my old girlfriend.

285
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:11,354
她也是个地质学家
She was a geologist, too.

286
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,739
你俩合不来吗?
Things didn't work out?

287
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:16,025
我有一天下班回家发现她把所有东西都拿走了
I came home from work one day and she had taken everything.

288
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,527
我警告你们
I'm warning you,

289
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,029
把收藏的好石头藏好
hide your good rocks.

290
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,117
我妹夫也拿走全部东西了
My sister's husband took all her things, too.

291
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,502
故事十一点整开始
Story at 11:00.

292
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,790
真的吗? 没人来了?
Really, no one else is coming?

293
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,343
就是这些了
Oh, this is it.

294
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,261
你们是试验品
You are the practice round.

295
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,046
试验品? 试验什么?
Practice round? For-for what?

296
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,349
不是 他意思是
Uh, no. He-he just means that

297
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,217
你们是我们第一个想到的人
you were the first people we thought of.

298
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,268
是的 
You know, exactly.

299
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,553
我们之前从来没有招待过早午餐
We've never thrown a brunch before,

300
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,688
我们想试一试 并解决其中缺陷
and I wanted to work out all the kinks.

301
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,025
所以 我就是只小白鼠
So, I'm like a lab rat

302
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:51,194
然后你们真正的朋友们才会过来?
before your real friends come over?

303
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,066
发现了吗 你的话没错
You see, your words sound reasonable,

304
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,952
但你的表情看起来很生气
but your face looks angry.

305
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,123
帮我一下 这个我不擅长
Help me out here. This is not where I shine.

306
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,290
听着 Stuart
Stuart,

307
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,543
你知道你是我们最喜欢的人之一
you know you're one of our favorite people.

308
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,911
发现了吗 你看起来很真诚
Okay, now, see, you look sincere,

309
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,213
但你说出来的东西全是错的
but your words are completely false.

310
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,715
我很高兴我们做了这次实验
I'm glad we did this test run.

311
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,467
这顿早午餐太棒了!
These brunches are wild!

312
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,839
但是你怎么让她答应和你约会的?
But how did you get her to go out with you?

313
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,591
她搬到了我对面住
Well, she moved in across the hall.

314
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,476
然后他就开始步步为营
And he started to slowly wear me down.

315
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:25,228
没错
Mm-hmm.

316
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,847
就像滴水穿石一样
Like a river carves a canyon.

317
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,651
但是这小水滴总给我看他的口袋妖怪卡片
Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokemon cards.

318
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:34,154
可以走了吗?
Ready to go?

319
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,355
等等 这人在跟我说
Hang on. This guy's telling me

320
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,607
他是怎么把杀人恶猿里面那女的弄到手的
how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.

321
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,192
就这人?
This guy?

322
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,112
带着零钱机的这人?
But he's wearing a change maker.

323
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,332
我觉得特别性感
I think it's hot.

324
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,618
没错
That's right.

325
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,670
我是她的零钱干爹
I'm her change daddy.

326
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,461
我在想什么啊?
What was I thinking?

327
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,964
Wolowitzes家族从不具备提升重物的能力
Wolowitzes are not a lifting people!

328
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,765
我们都是花钱雇人的!
We tip the lifting people!

329
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,686
我们真的有必要去急诊室
Do we really have to sit for hours

330
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:07,887
一呆几个小时吗?
in the emergency room?

331
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,606
他们只会给你冰块和止痛药的
They're just gonna give you ice and Advil

332
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:11,224
就像上次一样
like last time.

333
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,476
如果我坐轮椅了 你会很痛苦的
You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair.

334
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,480
另外 轮椅这玩意儿 在这辆保姆车里
Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back

335
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,983
还真是合适得不行
of this award-winning minivan.

336
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,453
知道了 我们去急诊室 别再给我推销这辆车了
Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.

337
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,705
你说得对 它可以自卖自夸
You're right. It sells itself.

338
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,492
你必须承认 这一路上还挺顺的
You have to admit, it's a pretty smooth ride.

339
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,461
我比较希望能安静一点
I was hoping it'd be quieter.

340
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,830
如果你生孩子的时候有现在一半的疼
If childbirth is half this bad,

341
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,666
你就完蛋了!
you are so screwed!

342
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,469
我们到了吗?! 快了
Are we there yet?! Soon.

343
00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:41,254
为什么要这么久啊?!
Why is it taking so long?!

344
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,056
Howard 看DVD的屏幕
H... Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen.

345
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:46,175
我给你放了蝙蝠侠动画系列 你的最爱!
I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favorite!

346
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,561
我已经疼到看不了动画...
I'm in too much pain to watch cartoo...

347
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:51,064
喔! 这集不错
Oh! This is a good one.

348
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,982
我照顾他的时间
I've been babysitting him

349
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,684
可是比你长得多了
way longer than you have.

350
00:14:56,238 --> 00:15:00,023
好吧 不就一辆破车嘛 买就买
Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.

351
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,360
这是我吃过的味道最好的薄饼了
This is the best blintz I've ever had.

352
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,912
谢谢你
Oh. Thank you.

353
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,498
这已经把之前那尴尬的转折
It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn

354
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,533
弥补得差不多了
things took earlier.

355
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,037
我... 我想我还是先走了
You know what, I... I think I'm just gonna go.

356
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,922
别 Stuart 别走啊
No, Stuart, don't.

357
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,625
不... 我把你和Sheldon当作我的家人
No, I... I consider you and Sheldon like my family,

358
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,127
但我都拿不准你们是不是把我当朋友
and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend.

359
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,379
你知道这是什么感觉吗?
You have any idea how that feels?

360
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,882
我们很抱歉
We're so sorry.

361
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,051
每个人都是最后才会想起我
I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.

362
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,686
不是这样的
Well, no, that's not true.

363
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,188
有的时候大家最后才想起Koothrappali
I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali.

364
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,358
但说出来又不好
But we're not supposed to say that 'cause

365
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,393
因为他不受大众喜爱
he's a minority.

366
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,444
再见
Bye.

367
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,563
Stuart 等等
Stuart, wait.

368
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,784
我知道被人忽视和遗忘的滋味
I do know what it feels like to be left out.

369
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,402
我也知道
I know how it feels, too.

370
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,405
行了 这是我和他之间的事 你一边儿凉快去
All right, this is about me and him; you're not part of it.

371
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,577
Stuart 或许我们是有点不重视你了
Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted,

372
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,379
这样做是不对的
and that is not acceptable.

373
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,332
但请相信你确实是我们圈子里
Please know that you truly are a valuable member

374
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,633
珍贵的一员
of our social group.

375
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,418
谢谢
Thank you.

376
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,388
好了 我提议大家举杯
You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast.

377
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,009
敬Stuart
To Stuart.

378
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,428
一个好人
A fine man,

379
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,149
一个好朋友 一个很棒的客人
a good friend and a wonderful guest.

380
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:18,101
说的是 干杯
Hear, hear. Cheers.

381
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,821
干杯 于录音棚观众之前拍摄
Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.

382
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,945
这就是一个患有哮喘的矮子科学家
And that is how a short asthmatic scientist

383
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,581
攻陷了一个冰山美人的故事
landed a stone cold fox.

384
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,583
哇哦
Oh. Whoa.

385
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,620
我简直难以想象你可以向同一个人
I didn't know you can propose to the same person

386
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,672
求那么多次婚
so many times.

387
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:42,258
第三次我是用空中写字求的婚
The third time, I did it in skywriting,

388
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,876
但她头都没抬一下
but she never looked up.

389
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,429
还有一次 是我跟他求的婚
You know, once, I proposed to him.

390
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:48,381
是啊 我拒绝了
Yeah. I said no.

391
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,716
为什么?
Why?

392
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,934
我就是想让她多费点事儿
I just wanted to make her work for it.

393
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,638
没事 我们秋后算账
Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.

394
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,641
等等 她和你在一起是因为你有钱吗?
Hang on. Is she just with you because you're rich?

395
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,560
她赚的比我多了去了!
She makes more money than I do!

396
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,945
什么? 你也太强了吧!
What?! Who are you?!

397
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,911
你知道我还喜欢你什么吗?
Do you know what else I love about you?

398
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:14,962
什么?
Hmm?

399
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:19,083
你... 的书法 简直无懈可击!
Y... Your handwriting is impeccable!

400
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,334
谢谢你能注意到这个!
Thank you for noticing!

401
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,003
我说真的 我说真的
No, I mean it. I mean it.

402
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:25,423
你就仿佛拥有标签机的灵魂
It's like you have the soul of a label maker.

403
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,927
你知道我喜欢你什么吗?
You know what I love about you?

404
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,810
什么?
Hmm?

405
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,345
你出门一定会随身携带回形针!
You never leave the house without a paper clip!

406
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,098
你永远不知道什么时候就会出现两张纸
You never know when two pieces of paper

407
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,902
需要临时在左上角固定起来
might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.

408
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:44,358
我还喜欢你从来不说脏话
I also love how you never use swear words.

409
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,776
事实证明嘛
You know, it turns out,

410
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:49,914
不说脏话 你也一样可以伤人于无形
you can hurt people just as well without 'em.

411
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,869
有没有人来帮我收拾收拾这些东西啊
Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.

412
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,871
淡定
Oh, calm down.

413
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:59,006
我已经 "收拾" 了五杯这个了
I already put away five of these!

414
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,542
看见了吗?
You see?

415
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,712
开口没脏话 文明你我他
No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
