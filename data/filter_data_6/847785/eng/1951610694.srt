So you're just gonna
lie to people?

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,749
Oh, I'm not talking about
a lie--just a polite fiction

53
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,349

where you've been.

tell them that

55

00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,678
So why do I have to go
to this history fair anyway?

57
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,624
I mean, it's just
some dumb school contest.

We all know
Danielle's not gonna win.

59
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:30,927
She never wins anything.
- (sighs) is it weird
eating off plates?

60
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,439
'Cause if you were more
comfortable, you could just

61
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,823
Eat straight out of the garbage.
- This is a family event,

62
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,699
And we're all gonna
enjoy it together.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,176
Now, Danielle, stop sniping
and start thinking of an alibi

64
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,070
For your brother.
- I know. We could say he joined a cult,

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,879
And we had to kidnap and deprogram him.
- Well, that would certainly

66
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,856
Spare the family
some embarrassment.

67
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,852
Why not throw in
a killing spree, too?

68
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:53,080
Well, here's a thought--
We say he was at drama camp.

69
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,781
It reflects Andrew's interest
in the performing arts,

70
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,562
while giving us
a private joke to savor

71
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,137
about the drama
of his estrangement.

72
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:04,675
<i>Uh, yeah,
he is always like that.</i>

73
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:08,974
Uh, guys, why can't
we just tell the truth?

74
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,699
Uh, I got out of line,
you kicked me out,

75
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,542
I lived on the street,
and I came back home.

76
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:19,139
We'll need a name
for this drama camp.

77
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,158
We got ties here, people!

78
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,200

79
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:29,215
Ooh, do you like
those barbells?

80
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,194
Make me an offer.
- I'm feeling generous.

81
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,187
Here's the customer
I've been waiting for.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,032

I'll give you $5 for this.

83
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,386

- You're having a garage sale

84

and sporting equipment.

85
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:44,835
I need cash,

86
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,641
and you don't expect me
to sell <i>my</i> stuff, do you?

87
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:49,394
Those are
my good cuff links!

88
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,184
Those are my CDs!

89
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,851
Oh, my God,
This is my baby blanket.

90
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,124
My mamÃ¡ knitted this!

91
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,437
And it pains me to sell it.

92
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,266
It's just that
my lawyer told me

93
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,895
What you're offering
for spousal support,

94
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,598
And I can't get by on that.

95
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:03,797
Hey, I am doing
the best that I can.

96
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,140
I've got a few deals
in the pipeline,

97
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,852
But I'm not making
near as much as I used to.
- So I should be punished?

00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,420

103
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,383
Oh, honey, the gloves
aren't just off...

104
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,589
They're 70% off!

105
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,457
Get your cashmere gloves!

106
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,553
Hey, Parker,
where's your uniform?

107
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:35,168
You got your game
in an hour.

108
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:38,402
No, I don't. I quit.
What?

109
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:39,440
I hate baseball.

110
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,718
Daddy said I don't have
to play it anymore.

111
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:44,314
Well, Daddy should have
checked with mommy,

112
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,035
So she could have a chance
to tell him why he's wrong.

113
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:51,185
Hey, you're playing.
- But, Mom, I suck!

114
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:52,663
Everybody says so.

115
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:56,935
That's why they made up
a fake position for me.
- It is not fake.

116
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,417
There is not a team I know
that could get along

117
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,527
Without their backup
far right fielder.

118
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,207
Okay, come on,
Let's go practice.

119
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,038
All right,
let's try it again.

120
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:11,052
Nice and easy.
Watch the ball hit the bat.

121
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,207
You ready? You can do it.
Here we go.

122
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:15,820
Okay, Parker,

123
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,983
I keep telling you,
You gotta keep your eyes open.

124
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:19,802
How are you gonna hit the ball
when you're doing this?

125
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,269
You threw it too fast.
Throw slower.

126
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,781
If I threw any slower,
we would be bowling.

127
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:25,785
Hey.

128
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,279
Hey, whatcha guys doing?

129
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,256
I'll tell you what
we're not doing--quitting.

130
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,716
Oh, hey, buddy,
did you change your mind?

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,782
<i>No.</i>

132
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,757
Lynette, I told him that
he didn't have to play anymore.

133
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:38,357
He's got five more games
in the season.

134
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:42,832
He made a commitment.
he's gonna see it through.
- But, Lynette, he doesn't like it,

135
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:46,261
And if you haven't noticed,
he kind of sucks.
- Yeah, well, that's not the point.

136
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:48,099
What kind of message are
we sending if we let him quit

137
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,344
whenever the going gets rough?
- Honey, it is kids' baseball.

138
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:52,593
It's a way to kill three hours
before they eat pizza.

139
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:56,495
Why you being
such a hard-ass?
- Well, it's called parenting,
Tom. Watch and learn.

140
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,260
Okay, P-dog,

141
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,725
This is a curveball.

142
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:11,970
Again, opening the eyes--
can't stress it enough.

143
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,924
Are you sure it's okay
if we stay another day?

144
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:21,792
Well, let's see. What excuse did we use
when we had this conversation yesterday?

145
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,175
That we work hard,
And we deserve to relax.

146
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,727
No, I believe that was
last Thursday's rationale.

147
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,006
Uh, fresh air
is good for us?
- Ah, Tuesday.

148
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:29,864
Okay, here's one--

149
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,600
Julie needs to spend more time
bonding with her father.

150
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,694
Brilliant!
(laughs)

151
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,295
If we keep this up,

152
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,433
We could stay here
till Christmas. (laughs)

153
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:42,444
You know, some--sometimes
when you smile like that,

154
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,162
That--that--that really
makes me think that--that...

155
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:47,253
What?
What were you gonna say?

156
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:49,457
Well, it makes me think
that I could love you.

157
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,623
I... Don't mean "love"

158
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,823
In the swooning schoolboy
sense--

159
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,852
You know,
fireworks exploding,

160
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,289
Bells ringing.

161
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,374
(chuckles)
To me, it's--it's about this--

162
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:04,229
A mundane task that--
that's suddenly a joy

163
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,832
because of who
you're doing it with.

164
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,570
That's love to me--

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
someone to fluff
while you fold,

166
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,539
someone to whisper to
at a boring party,

167
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,243
someone to--to--

168
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,623
Shh. Do you mind?

169
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,170
You're kind of drowning out
the bells.

170
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,699
So I am.

171
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,830
I think
I can feed myself now.

172
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,474
Mm, you said that yesterday,

173
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,342
And I wound up with
a cleavage full of pudding.

174
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:36,008
You heard the therapist.

175
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,446
It's gonna be weeks
before you're up and running.

176
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,473
I just wanna get home,
unpack.

177
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,557
You just let home
come to you, okay?

178
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,022
The whole street's
dying to see you.

179
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:53,481
(southern accent) Bree is
even bakin' ya a peach pie.

180
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,885
She's the redhead, right?

181
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,538
(normal voice) right.

182
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:00,757
Husband's a doctor...

183
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,046
Rex.

184
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:06,832
Rex is dead.

185
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:09,690
Really?

186
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,394
When did that happen?

187
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:13,184
About
a year and a half ago.

188
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:14,471
What?

189
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:16,772
Yeah.
You were at his funeral.

190
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,073
What are you talking about?
That's not possible.

191
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,063
I just met him
right before my accident.

192
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,302
Mike...

193
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,422
What year is it?

194
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,162
2004. Why?

195
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,146
It's called
retrograde memory loss.

196
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:40,103
It's caused by the swelling
and frontal lobe damage.

197
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,950
You say
he's lost two whole years?

198
00:09:43,523 --> 00:09:45,704
Yeah. Is that unusual?

199
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:49,079
Ah, patients more typically
lose several weeks.

200
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,006
The damage may be more severe
than we thought.

201
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,226
Well, do you think
he'll get his memory back?

202
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,739
He might,
At least partially.

203
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,088
You could be of
some assistance with that.

204
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:01,392
How?

205
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,263
Bring him
some personal belongings,

206
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,546
Photos, letters.

207
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,570
He's gonna need some help
to remember what he can't.

208
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,988
Oh, I'm sure
I could fill in a few blanks.

209
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,169
Hey, did I tell you
that, uh,

210
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,471
Burnham fox is looking
for a new creative director?

211
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:30,672
PR? What makes you think
I wanna work for a PR firm?

212
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:35,049
Easy hours, big paycheck,
access to great parties...

213
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:36,571
Yeah, what was I thinking?

214
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:39,255
Honey, we agreed that
I would chase my dreams,

215
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,416
And that ain't it.

216
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,501
Look, I was just
making conversation.

217
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:44,342
Batter up!

218
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,254
- (boy) Is he up?
- (boy) Oh, come on!

219
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,676
(Lynette) Come on, Parker!
Keep your eye on the ball!

220
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:56,783
Strike one!

221
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,187
Hey, people,
he's just a kid, okay?

222
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:01,804
Come on.

223
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,062
Strike two!

224
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,409
Hey, hey,
That is not helpful.

225
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,454
It only takes one, Parker!
Only takes one!
- (boy) come on, Parker!

226
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,048
It's not your son's fault.

227
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,113
He's just up against
the best pitcher in the league.

228
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,999
Yeah, guy's a machine.
Who is that kid?

229
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,133
Nicky Abbott.
He's a neighbor of mine.

230
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:21,812
The kid's got an arm
like a 13 year old.

231
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:26,152
(umpire)
Strike three! You're out!

232
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:30,369
I'm gonna
go buy him an ice cream.

233
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,552
It's okay, P-dog.

234
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,413
You're gonna get 'em
the next inning!

235
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:48,523
So tell me,

236
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,234
what else do you know
about this Nicky kid?

237
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:55,586
You're short 50 cents.

238
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,899
Please, that's all I got.

239
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,263
Hey, give the kid
what he wants.

240
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:03,888
Thanks.

241
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:05,604
Hey, aren't you, uh,
Parker Scavo's mom?

242
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:06,486
That's right.

243
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,205
Come. Walk with me.

244
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,254
So...

245
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,492
Money's a little tight,
huh?

246
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:15,509
A little.

247
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,546
Yeah, I heard
your old man's out of work.

248
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:18,764
That's gotta be tough.

249
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,113
Yeah, they, uh,
cut my allowance.

250
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:23,480
No! A kid's gotta have
an allowance.

251
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,942
How else you gonna buy
the things you want, right?

252
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:27,990
Like that cotton candy.

253
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,849
That's a little piece
of heaven, huh?

254
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,482
(chuckles)

255
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:36,816
Hey, I got an idea. Maybe we
could help each other out.

256
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,633
My son's having a little trouble
hitting the ball.

257
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,043
Yeah, I saw that.

258
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,749
Yeah.

259
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:44,669
Ever seen one of these?

260
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,754
Carlos,
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,002
I mean, besides lowering
my property value.

262
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,399
I had a little news,

263
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,386
And I wanted to see your face
when I delivered it.
- Oh.

264
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,235
I'm tired of fighting,

265
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,574
so I called my lawyer
and told him

266
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:16,075
to give in to your demands
for spousal support.

267
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:16,961
Really?

268
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,039
Wow. Well, thank you.

269
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,043
Okay, you've seen my face.
Now you can beat it.

270
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,948
Wait. There's more.

271
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,937
Since I'm gonna be giving you
all that money,

272
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:33,030
I have to cut back
on some stuff,

273
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:34,964
like the rent
on my apartment.

274
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,600
But the good news is,
according to my lawyer,

275
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:40,072
I'm completely
within my rights to do this...

276
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,587
Honey, I'm home.

277
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:53,065
Wait! You can't stay here!

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,682
Now there's the face
that I was looking for.

279
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,725
(umpire) Batter up!

280
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:11,533
Strike one!

281
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:14,140
Wow, that was
kind of slow.

282
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,797
His arm
must be getting tired.

283
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,382
Yeah, well,
After all those fastballs...

284
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,016
Come on, Parker!

285
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,629
You can do it!

286
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:28,231
Strike two!

287
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,716
(gasps) Oh, my God! Yes!

288
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:25,949
Mr. Faladi.

289
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:27,927
Yes?
- I cannot thank you enough

290
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,683
for getting Danielle
interested in history.

291
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,774
She has never worked so hard
on a project before.

292
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,933
(chuckles)
Well, don't tell anyone,

293
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,754
but she is
my favorite student.

294
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:41,181
Oh, and it's so good to see
that Andrew's back.

295
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,283
Where's he been
all this time?

296
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:44,681
Drama camp--

297
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,079
a very prestigious
drama camp.

298
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,289
Do I know you?

299
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,219
Yeah, uh, you gave me a ride
in your black sedan once.

300
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,827
You know, the one
with the reclining seats?

301
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,289
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

302
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,673
Wasn't that Dr. Keck?
- You know him?

303
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,022
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh...

304
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:25,908
(chuckles)
Met at drama camp.

305
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:27,181
Oh, good lord.

306
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:28,482
You mean...
- Yeah.

307
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,825
I, uh--
"performed" for him once.

308
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:36,658
Are you all right?
- I'll be all right. I'm fine.

309
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,186
Howard Keck?

310
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:39,631
You sure?

311
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,749
I mean, he's a very respected
member of the community.

312
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,037
Yeah, well, they all were.

313
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:57,464
What were you and Andrew
talking about today at the fair?

314
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,802
Uh, nothing.

315
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,709
I was gonna make some cocoa.
Would you like some?

316
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,679
Orson, I saw
the two of you whispering

317
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:08,238
right after Dr. Keck ran off.
What happened?

318
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:18,406
Look, Andrew asked me
not to say anything,

319
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,375
But I don't want there to be
any secrets between us,

320
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:23,026
So please don't
let him know I told you.

321
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,496
Well, of course not.
What is it?

322
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:28,040
How to put this? Uh...

323
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,760
When Andrew
was on the street,

324
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,751
he, uh, he didn't just
beg for money.

325
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,530
At times, he...

326
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,364
Well, he did things
to earn it.

327
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,273
Oh, good.

328
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,543
I mean, I'd hate to think
he had no work ethic at all.

329
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,432
Uh, what I mean is...

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,966
men hired him, uh, to...

331
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,367
uh, do things--
things he wasn't very proud of.

332
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,931
Yard work?

333
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:56,588
Afraid not.

334
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:59,289
Orson, you're scaring me.

335
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:00,687
Did he do something awful?

336
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,508
No! No. Not awful.

337
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,550
I mean,
people do it all the time.

338
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,200
I do it with you.
I just don't pay you for it.

339
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,293
I think someone
could use a cocoa.

340
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,747
Look,
We mustn't judge Andrew.

341
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,249
He was desperate.
I'll never forgive myself.

342
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,930
It's all my fault
for pushing him away.
- Bree, don't do that toourself.

343
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,690
The important thing now is
that he's home and he's safe.

344
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,451
How does this Dr. Keck
fit into all of this?

345
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:35,081
I mean, is he treating Andrew
for some awful disease?

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,945
Actually, I think
he was one of Andrew's...

347
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,240
Clients.

348
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:40,837
Howard Keck?!

349
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,010
Oh, that's ridiculous.
He's got a wife and a daughter.

350
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:47,519
He plays on Tom Scavo's bowling team.
- Well, that's clearly not
the only team he plays for.

351
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:51,220
This is a nightmare,
an absolute nightmare.

352
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:55,663
Please don't cut into that pie.
I made it for Mike.

353
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,759
Mike? Delfino?

354
00:18:58,829 --> 00:18:59,999
Yes. I left you
two messages.

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,199
Didn't you check
your voice mail?

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,820
He woke up
from his coma. (sighs)

357
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,011
Who is it ? It is Sharla Banning?

358
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:13,180
I'm not telling who it is.
I'm just asking the question.

359
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,727
If you know a husband
has been unfaithful,

360
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:18,267
do you tell the wife?
- Absolutely.

361
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:21,216
If he's cheating, he could bring home a disease.
- Okay, that's what I was thinking.

362
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,945
I mean, that's how
Bunny Connors got chlamydia.
- (gasps) She told me

363
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,033
she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.
- No, that's how she got crabs.

364
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:30,682
Poor bunny.
It's always something.

365
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:33,037
If it's not the clap,
It's a botched face-lift.
(laughs)

366
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,828
Be that as it may,

367
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:38,118
Do we all agree that I should tell this man's wife?
- I wouldn't.

368
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,008
Women always say they wanna know 
if their husband's cheating,

369
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:43,017
and they always resent
the person who tells them.

370
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,725
So if Tom was cheating, you wouldn't tell me?
- No!

371
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,296
But I would hire someone
to beat the crap out of him.

372
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,908
Aw, you're sweet.
(chuckles)

373
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:53,744
Bree, I'm sorry.

374
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:57,995
I think you gotta follow your heart on this one,
even if it isn't the easiest thing to do.

375
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:00,597
Gaby...

376
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,809
Are you and Carlos
getting back together?

377
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:05,735
Why?

378
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,997
Uh... Would you excuse me?

379
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,544
What are you doing? I told you
I was having friends over!

380
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,173
I'm thirsty!
And this is my kitchen, too.

381
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,518
Hey, ladies!

382
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:27,853
Oh, for God sakes, put some pants on!
- Well, I wanted to,

383
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:30,965
But somebody threw my laundry
out of the dryer

384
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,691
While it was still wet.
- Don't act like you didn't deserve that.

385
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:34,421
What are you talking about?

386
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,340
You peed in my shampoo.
Admit it!

387
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:37,858
What?!
Yeah, the cap was loose,

388
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:40,073
And I know how your sick mind works.
- Oh, really?

389
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,389
Well, in that case,
You should know that

390
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,661
If I was gonna
do something like that,

391
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:44,270
I wouldn't do it
to your shampoo.

392
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,802
I would do it to your mouthwash,
soup and decaffeinated coffee.

393
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,298
Ladies.

394
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:01,730
To answer your question--

395
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,432
No, we are not
getting back together.

396
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,584
I love this music.

397
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:20,492
What's it about?

398
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,100
Making love, regret,

399
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,543
cigarettes.

400
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,056
Cigarettes?

401
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:26,973
That's what I assume.

402
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:28,542
It's French.
They write what they know.

403
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:31,456
(chuckles) I'd love
to go to France someday.

404
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,172
Would you like
to go next month?

405
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,325
(laughs) are you serious?

406
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,880
Yeah, I'm going on business.
Come with me.

407
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,196
Oh, Ian,
I just took a week off.

408
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,315
I couldn't possibly justify
taking another.

409
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,769
Oh, you'll manage.

410
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:49,292
We've already proven ourselves
masters of the flimsy rationalization.

411
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,987
Well... Okay.

412
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:55,274
You gotta promise me
we'll actually leave the hotel room.

413
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:59,114
It's Paris, dear. You can
pretty much make love anywhere.

414
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,019
Mmm.

415
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:03,412
(groans)
I thought you said you didn't
get reception up here.

416
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:05,612
We, the occasional signal
gets through.

417
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:07,110
Please don't answer.

418
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:09,384
Oh, it's Julie.
I have to.

419
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,269
Hello? What's up?

420
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:12,888
Hey.

421
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:14,834
(loudly) Uh, I can't--

422
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,992
No, can you say that again?

423
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:19,752
The signal's really bad.

424
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:22,714
What?

425
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,500
Oh, my God.

426
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,976
Is something wrong?
Mike woke up.

427
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:28,802
Um, Julie, when--when did he...

428
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:30,818
Julie? Julie!

429
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:32,545
(cell phone beeps)
Oh, damn it!

430
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:33,952
Oh, my God.

431
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:36,818
Oh! Oh, my God!

432
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:37,641
Um...

433
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,338
Uh, I-I... I have to go.

434
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,213
Um, I gotta
get out of here.

435
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:43,089
Yes, of course.

436
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,349
Uh, I-I think that
you're sitting on my bra.

437
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:56,299
What'd the coach say?

438
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,405
What do you think he said?
Parker's off the team.

439
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,489
That's not fair!
It's not his fault!

440
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,743
It doesn't matter,

441
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,837
Because his mother bribed
an 8-year-old pitcher,

442
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,488
Who also, by the way,
Was kicked off of his team.

443
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,072
Not Nicky, too!

444
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:11,468
What were you thinking?

445
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:13,855
I was trying to repair

446
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:16,184
my son's shattered self-esteem.

447
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,439
With a $50?

448
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,488
Yeah.

449
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,917
Honey, everything
would've been fine

450
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,426
If you had
just let Parker quit.

451
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,979
Well, excuse me for not wanting
my son to be a quitter.

452
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,583
Yeah, 'cause I guess
having two in the family
would be a bit much.

453
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:34,209
Whoa.
Where'd that come from?

454
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:36,089
You say that
you support my decision

455
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,587
to leave advertising
and follow my dream,

456
00:23:37,637 --> 00:23:41,379
but it is obvious to me
that you resent it.
- That is not true!

457
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,556
Why do you keep dropping
all these hints about the job

458
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:47,530
at Burnham Fox then, huh?
- I just figured, since you're taking your time

459
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,417
figuring out
what your dream even is,

460
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,421
you might wanna make
a few bucks in the meantime.

461
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:54,096
I have a dream, too.
It includes keeping this house.

462
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:54,874
Oh, like I don't--

463
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,201
Are you fighting?
- No!

464
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,224
No.

465
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,946
It was excitement,
because we have just decided

466
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:08,434
you don't have
to play baseball anymore.

467
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:10,961
Ha! Isn't that great?
But I can't stop now.

468
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:13,469
Huh?
- Not when I'm finally
getting good.

469
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,146
You were right, Mom. I just
needed a little more practice.

470
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:18,004
So come on, come on!
Let's go practice!

471
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:18,800
See you outside.

472
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,484
So what's on the next page
of your parenting handbook?

473
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:32,031
Ian, can you please hurry?

474
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,386
I am hurrying!
- We should've been
on the road ten minutes ago.

475
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:36,181
It's not like
checking out of a hotel.

476
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,355
There's doors to secure.

477
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:40,191
I have to turn the gas valve off.
- Can't you do that stuff later?

478
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,283
When? After the place
is overrun by raccoons?

479
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,058
Of course, the joke would be
on them when it blows up.

480
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,032
Mike is awake! He's lying there
and he's wondering where I am.

481
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:48,497
Yes, I get it.
You're in a hurry.

482
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,926
Just please
give me a minute.

483
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,141
I bet you'd move faster
If Jane were awake.

484
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:03,688
Ah, here's the picture
that you took of me

485
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,683
In my bikini
at that pool party.

486
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,971
You could've warned me
I was showing a little nip.

487
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,999
Oh, Susan Mayer.

488
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,494
Remember her?

489
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:13,659
Yeah.

490
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:15,691
She's pretty.

491
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,990
Yeah, she is, sorta,
In this picture.

492
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,229
Is there a date
on this thing?

493
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,112
The nurses said that
she visited me a lot.

494
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:24,691
We were close, huh?

495
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:26,837
You have just
come out of a coma.

496
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:30,481
Can we not talk about Susan
till you start to regain your strength?

497
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:31,842
Why?

498
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:34,426
Oh, God.

499
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,410
I hate to be the one
telling you this...

500
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,701
Well,
If you don't want to--

501
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,525
That tramp
treated you like dirt.

502
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:44,053
She strung you along.
She slept with other guys.

503
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:46,005
You broke up
with her twice.

504
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:49,212
Well, why did she keep visiting
me when I was out of it?

505
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:52,051
Well,
She's a bit of a stalker.

506
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,993
I was worried that
she was gonna come in here
and disconnect one of the tubes or something.

507
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:57,670
But don't worry.

508
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,241
She's glommed on
to some new guy,

509
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,452
And she's up in the mountains
at his place with him right now.

510
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:04,980
Wow.

511
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,187
She told the nurses
that she really loved me.

512
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:14,077
That's the one thing
about Susan
that you must never forget--

513
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,641
She is a liar.

514
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:29,747
You waiting to see
Mike Delfino?

515
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,544
Uh, yes.
I'm a... I'm a neighbor.

516
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:36,203
But, uh, he already has a visitor,
so I'll come back later.

517
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,271
Well, don't be surprised
if he doesn't recognize you.

518
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:41,038
He's suffered
significant memory loss.

519
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,344
Really?

520
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:46,816
Oh, that's too bad.

521
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:49,848
You sure you don't want
to go in?

522
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:51,982
Ms. Britt's here all the time.
She won't mind.

523
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,516
No. I've waited this long.
I can wait a bit longer.

524
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:14,038
Gaby!

525
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:25,474
Hey, Carlos. What's up?
My key won't work.

526
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,408
That's probably because
I had the locks changed.

527
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:33,622
Gaby!
- Can't be too safe.

528
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,541
You never know when someone
might move in on you
when you're not looking.

529
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:48,981
Hello, 9-1-1?

530
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:51,420
There's an intruder
breaking into my home.

531
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,977
Can you tell them
to come armed?

532
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,444
(whispers)
I think he's Mexican.

533
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:01,185
I'm telling you,
I'm her husband.

534
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,378
I bought her this house.
My name is on the deed

535
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,844
Ma'am, if you're married,
It's a matter of public record.

536
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:06,959
I can find out very quickly.

537
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,759
All right, but we're going
through a very messy divorce,

538
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,103
And he moved back in on me.

539
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:18,399
And everyone knows
the wife keeps the house,

540
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,193
And the husband gets
the crappy apartment.

541
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:21,409
It's the American way.

542
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,038
Call my lawyer. This is all
totally legal, and s knows it.

543
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,308
She's just trying
to get back at me.

544
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:29,828
I hear that.

545
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,022
You wouldn't believe the stuff
my wife pulled when we split.

546
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:37,479
Whoa!

547
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:39,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't take sides!

548
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:41,546
Police officers
aren't allowed to take sides.

549
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,196
<i>I pay your salary.</i>

550
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,565
Ted, did you see that?
This lady just assaulted me.

551
00:28:47,631 --> 00:28:50,326
Oh. (scoffs)
It was a swat.

552
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,393
Ted, does this hurt?

553
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,865
Get your hands off me!

554
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,507
Police brutality!

555
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:11,716
This is all my fault.

556
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,153
Why punish Parker?

557
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,881
Sorry, Mr.. Scavo.
Rules are rules.

558
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:18,985
I can't put him back on the team.
- Just one more game.

559
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,062
He'll suck,
the other kids will taunt him,

560
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,764
and he'll wanna quit again.
- See, everybody wins.

561
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,168
I wish I could help, but...

562
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,162
Please? You can't
bend the rules just once?

563
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:32,049
Did you know the team could use
some new batting helmets?

564
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,651
Are you asking for a bribe?

565
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,911
You pretending
you're above that?

566
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,501
I'll get my checkbook.

567
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:44,422
Hello, Vera.

568
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:49,201
I made you some of those, uh,
Shortbread biscuits that you like so much.
How sweet!

569
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:52,632
Can you stay for some tea?
It's been so long.

570
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:54,138
We have some
catching up to do.

571
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,350
Yes. Yes, we do.

572
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,297
I know how painful
this must be for you.

573
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,297
It isn't easy
for me either,

574
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:10,849
Considering
Andrew's role in it.

575
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,110
And why have you
told me this?

576
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:16,179
Because I thought
you'd want to know.

577
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:18,837
Why?

578
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:21,347
So you could do something.

579
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:27,659
Do you think I'm an idiot?

580
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:32,090
That I know nothing about
the man I've lived with for 27 years?

581
00:30:35,326 --> 00:30:38,300
I've always assumed
Howard had some... outlet,

582
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:40,300
A friend
tucked away somewhere.

583
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:41,164
I didn't know.

584
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,592
I didn't care to know.

585
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,047
But thank you
for painting so vivid,

586
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:51,205
So indelible a picture
of my husband's activities.

587
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,474
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,786
I just felt that
if it were me, I--

589
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,846
You'd want to know.
Yes, absolutely.

590
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:58,803
Then I owe you an apology,

591
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:02,859
Because I've been
sitting on a little secret
about your family.

592
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,627
Oh?

593
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:06,212
Actually, it's not much
of a secret.

594
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:07,786
My daughter tells me

595
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:10,536
it's common knowledge
among the cheerleaders.
- What is?

596
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:14,632
The fact that Danielle is sleeping
with her history teacher.

597
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:19,931
But where are my manners?

598
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,013
I should have brought
some biscuits with that.

599
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,782
Well, aren't we just
the parents of the year?

600
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:35,012
Sitting in the stands,
Waiting for our son to fail

601
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,260
So we can weasel out
of a bribery scandal.

602
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,336
<i>Two</i> bribery scandals.
Gotta count the batting helmets.

603
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:44,858
Strike one!

604
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:48,497
You know, for what it's worth,
I don't think you're a quitter.

605
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:49,404
Good.

606
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,252
And you don't resent me?

607
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:52,985
No.

608
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:54,574
(umpire) Ball one!

609
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,370
Okay, well, maybe a little.

610
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,254
Why?
You get to chase your dream

611
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,554
while I get to spend the rest
of my life in advertising.

612
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,062
Strike two!

613
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:04,908
Maybe I'd like
to write a book

614
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,160
Or, you know,
start my own magazine.

615
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,318
And then I think,
"No, I can't.

616
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:11,585
I have a family to support,"
And I am okay with that...

617
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,406
(umpire) Ball two!
- ... most of the time.

618
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:15,643
You know what?

619
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:18,337
I'm gonna look
into that job at Burnham Fox.

620
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:19,749
Don't you dare!

621
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,544
You are gonna
chase your dream,

622
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:24,631
And I am gonna support you
99% of the time.

623
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:27,929
It's all I could
really ask for.

624
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:38,769
How the hell
did he do that?!

625
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,653
(boy)
Yeah! Come on, come on!

626
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:43,659
Crap, they're cheering
for him.

627
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,793
Oh, he's never gonna
quit now!

628
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,276
What are we gonna
say to him?

629
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,845
(boy) Go, go, go, go!

630
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,489
Ow! Ow!

631
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,130
I don't know, buddy.

632
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,818
Looks like
a pretty bad sprain.

633
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,542
Probably gonna be out
the rest of the season.

634
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,028
Damn.

635
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,161
Hey, but you know what?
That was one heck of a hit.

636
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,874
Sure was.

637
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,794
I posted your bail.
We can go.

638
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:50,239
<i>(sighs) Gaby--
don't talk to me.</i>

639
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,821
Oh, lighten up.

640
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:53,914
You were in there
for maybe an hour.

641
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,025
The whole thing is funny,
And you know it.

642
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:00,292
Come on, Gaby!

643
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,130
We've been going at each other
for months now.

644
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,081
Can we just stop?

645
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,663
You know
as well as I do

646
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:06,832
we're gonna
end up back together.

647
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:08,862
<i>Wow, you are crazy.</i>

648
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:11,291
No, what's crazy is throwing
away the past three years.

649
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,454
I mean,
Why can't we just say

650
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:15,095
What we really feel
for a change?

651
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:22,538
Fine, I'll get the ball rolling.
I still love you.

652
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,117
That's too bad,
because I don't love you.

653
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:25,299
(laughs) yeah, right.

654
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:27,508
I don't...

655
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,891
And I haven't
for a very long time.

656
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:35,181
That's a lie. You're just
saying that to hurt me.

657
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:36,736
No, if I wanted  hurt you,

658
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,229
I would tell you
about last weekend...

659
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,938
When I slept
with John Rowland.

660
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:52,319
(Gabrielle)
Carlos, what are you doing?

661
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:54,078
Carlos!

662
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:57,965
What are you doing?! Carlos!

663
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:00,908
You can't leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere!

664
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,697
Ah

665
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,087
Carlos!

666
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,655
(Bree) Danielle! Danielle,
he is your history teacher,

667
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,066
and he is 35 years old!

668
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:36,338
Robert says age is just a number.
- Don't you dare leave this house!

669
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:38,618
You can't break us up!
I love him, and he loves me!

670
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:51,380
Come on, Mom.

671
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:56,650
I am so tired of feeling like
the worst mother who ever lived.

672
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:58,603
You're not.

673
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:00,414
There's Grandma.

674
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:07,608
I just--I've tried so hard
to set a good example.
I've done the best I could

675
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:11,310
to teach you kids
right from wrong.

676
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Why isn't it taking?

677
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:15,068
It took.

678
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,735
I mean, we know the difference
between right and wrong.

679
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:18,931
We just chose "wrong."

680
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:21,410
Why?

681
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:24,842
Sometimes when you push a kid
really hard to go one way,

682
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:27,592
the other way starts to look
more entertaining.

683
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:29,890
You're awful.

684
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,384
Yeah, I know.

685
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:32,961
I blame shoddy parenting.

686
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:41,501
You know, we never discussed

687
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:44,313
What it was like for you
while you were... away.

688
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:45,672
I just want you to know,

689
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:48,298
if you ever wanna
talk about it,

690
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,215
there's nothing
you can't tell me.

691
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,886
Um... thanks.

692
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:00,345
Not right now. Okay?

693
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,723
I'll pick up my bags later.

694
00:37:12,846 --> 00:37:14,433
It's not my fault
you weren't there.

695
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:18,957
What?
- It's not. I know what you're feeling, but--

696
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:20,643
How could you possibly know
what I was feeling?

697
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,027
For six months,
I have prayed every day

698
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:25,261
For that man to wake up,
And you made me give up on him.

699
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,080
I did not make you.
- Okay, not on purpose,
but you did.

700
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,157
You were sweet
and charming and English,

701
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,108
And that's why
when my prayers were answered,

702
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:34,479
I was a hundred miles away,
naked in someone else's arms.

703
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,237
<i>This</i> should never
have happened.

704
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,341
You can say
what you want about this,

705
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,753
say that you feel guilty,
say that it was bad timing,

706
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:43,494
but--but don't you say that
this should never have happened!

707
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:48,163
Because you're the--

708
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,160
you're the best thing
that's happened to me in years.

709
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:56,298
Ian, I'm--I'm sorry.

710
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,768
I know how you feel.

711
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,535
It's Mike.

712
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,538
It's my Mike.

713
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,759
Well, then--
Then you should go.

714
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:19,488
Thank you.

715
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:36,192
Oh, my God.

716
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,031
You <i>are</i> awake.

717
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:40,781
Hi, Susan.

718
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,598
Oh, God!

719
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:45,729
It's so wonderful
to hear your voice again.

720
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,139
They say
you've been here a lot.

721
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:51,680
Yes! Yes, I have.
Almost every day.

722
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,305
I can't tell you
how much I'm kicking myself

723
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,832
for not being here
when you woke up.

724
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:57,718
Where were you?

725
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,254
I was in the country.

726
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,271
But I'm back now.
(chuckles)

727
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,036
Okay.

728
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:12,698
Is something wrong?

729
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:14,932
You... You don't
seem happy to see me.

730
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:21,380
To be honest,
I don't remember you.

731
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:24,381
What?

732
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:28,076
I remember moving to Fairview
and meeting people,

733
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:30,258
But after that, nothing.

734
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,240
The doctors say
it's the head trauma.

735
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:36,443
Oh.

736
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,188
But you're gonna be all right.
(chuckles)

737
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:41,696
And I'm gonna
help you remember.

738
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,823
And if you don't mind,
I'm kind of tired now.

739
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,365
Oh. Okay. (laughs)

740
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,282
Right, you--
you, um, you sleep.

741
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,473
I'll come back tomorrow.

742
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,853
I'd rather you didn't.

743
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,099
Well, I've got therapy.

744
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:09,823
Maybe next week.

745
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:17,637
Okay.

746
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:00,528
<i>We all have our reasons
for rewriting history.</i>

747
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:06,146
<i>Sometimes we need
to provide ourselves alibis...</i>

748
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:07,905
Drama camp was awesome.

749
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,365
Uh, we're talking
zero supervision.

750
00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:14,929
<i>Sometimes we wanna hurt someone
who has hurt us...</i>

751
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:17,845
So you can tell Carlos that
he can have the photo albums.

752
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,851
She says that they hold
no sentimental value for her.

753
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,221
<i>and then there are times</i>

754
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:27,538
<i>we just wanna spare
ourselves embarrassment...</i>

755
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:29,192
I don't know how
these rumors get started.

756
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:31,401
No, Parker only quit the team
'cause he hurt his ankle.

757
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,075
<i>Of course,</i>

758
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,028
<i>there are some who feel
that to rewrite history</i>

759
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:41,208
<i>is just
another way to lie...</i>

760
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,045
And poor Howard
has to work late again tonight.

761
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,157
Of course,
He does it all for the family.

762
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:53,096
<i>but what is history anyway...</i>

763
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:56,629
You say I dated Susan
for a long time.

764
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,725
Do you think
I was in love with her?

765
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,515
<i>but a set of lies
agreed upon?</i>

766
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:07,646
I don't. I really...

767
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,096
Really don't.

768
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,643
