37 minutes,

30
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,260
從家里出發  到坐上地鐵
we got from the apartment to the subway,

31
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,210
最后到達學校  又刷新記錄了
to the pastery school in record time.

32
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,760
雖然我來不及穿胸罩
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra,

33
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,730
而且丁字褲好像也前后穿反了
and my thong might be on backwards.

34
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,130
丁字褲怎么會穿反呢
There is no wrong way to wear a thong,

35
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,820
只要不舒服就對了
as long as it's uncomfortable.

36
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,360
而且你穿胸罩也只是擺設而已
And with you, the bra is just for decoration.

37
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,200
而我是必須得穿
I have to wear one because you get a ticket

38
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
"孩子"不放安全座椅上  是要吃罰單的
for not put the kids in a car seat.

39
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,570
教室見  我得先跟我老婆道別
See you in class guys, I gotta say good bye to my wife.

40
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,570
你真以為我要跟你吻別嗎
You think I was gonna kiss you?

41
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,470
對啊
Yes.

42
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,850
我是你老婆  你是我那位
I'm the wife, you are the husband

43
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,310
某天被我發現你有異裝癖
who I caught wearing my cloth one day,

44
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,190
但我卻沒戳穿的老公
but I don't say anything about it.

45
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,630
早安啊  二位
Morning, guys.

46
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,910
早安  碧碧
Oh, hi, Bebe.

47
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,640
見到我很驚訝吧
Surprised to see me, right?

48
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,730
大家總以為我會在夜半時分自殺
Everyone always thinks I'm not gonna make it through the night,

49
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,400
但我還活著  連我自己都驚訝  
but here I am, even surprised myself.

50
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,450
跟一個隨時會崩潰的人
What's it like working in an office

51
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,340
在同一間辦公室工作是什么感覺呢
with someone who's about to snap like a breadstick?

52
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,760
絕對沒想象中這么有趣
Not as much fun as you'd think.

53
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,750
但碧碧人很好  而且在這工作
But Bebe's sweet, and working here

54
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,220
主要是為了替你掙學費
is putting you through pastry school.

55
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,360
-好啦  再見  -再見
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

56
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,480
-我要離婚  -早去申請了
- I want a divorce. - I already filed.

57
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,500
老婆  我要五塊錢
Hey, wife, I need $5

58
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
賠昨天弄壞的工具
to pay for a spatula I broke yesterday.

59
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,630
我昨天突然戈登﹒拉姆齊上身了
I was having a Gordon Ramsay moment.

60
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,670
{\an8}戈登﹒拉姆齊  英國知名廚師與電視名人
脾氣火爆  時常罵人

61
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,540
有機會我不介意跟他睡哦
I'd have sex with him, by the way.

62
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,330
為啥  他肯定也是會吼你
Why? He'd just be yelling at you

63
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,470
然后說你"做"錯了
and telling you you're doing it wrong.

64
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,250
做愛不都這樣嗎
Yeah, sex.

65
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,950
拿吧  錢在我包里
Take it. It's in my purse.

66
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,070
碧碧  你有偷偷不吃的藥嗎
Yo, Bebe, you got any extra pills you're not taking?

67
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,290
沒有  我全都有吃
No, I'm taking them all.

68
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,480
老天爺  別啊
Oh, my God, no.

69
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,870
干嘛  我也就想要個一顆  兩顆
What? I just wanted one. Or two.

70
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,860
就想減減壓
Just to take the edge off.

71
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,870
三點我有一場生奶油考試
I have a whipped cream final at 3:00.

72
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,110
是報紙里的訃告
No. In the obituaries.

73
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,770
我認識這個人
I know this person.

74
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,800
"安東尼婭﹒佛羅倫蒂諾  享年八十
"Antonia Florentino, 80,

75
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
在睡夢中安詳過世"
Died peacefully in her sleep."

76
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,560
明顯是自殺嘛  對吧
That's a suicide, right?

77
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,160
她是我的保姆
She was my nanny.

78
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,460
你現在還有保姆啊
You still have a nanny?

79
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,270
真幸福
Lucky.

80
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,420
我小時候大多數時間都是她帶大的
She took care of me most of my childhood.

81
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,960
我好愛她
I loved her so much.

82
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,380
節哀
So sorry.

83
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,260
我對我的老鄰居卡拉
That's kind of how I felt

84
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,100
也有這種感覺
about my old neighbor, Carla.

85
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,500
雖然她沒有養育我
I mean, she didn't take care of me,

86
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,740
但在我小的時候  她都允許我
but when I was a kid, she used to let me

87
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,540
喝她家花園水管的水
drink out of her hose.

88
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,080
我最后一次見安東尼婭  是她載我
The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me

89
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,030
和邋遢鬼妮莉﹒費塔朵一起去參加青少年選擇獎
and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards.

90
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,030
{\an8}妮莉﹒費塔朵加拿大女歌手  曾贏得過青少年選擇獎

91
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,170
現在可以在辦公室里哭了嗎
Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?

92
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,450
我一般只在車里哭
'cause I only do it in my car.

93
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,750
麥克斯  你知道我意識到什么嗎
Max, you know what I just realized?

94
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,140
這是我保姆死后  我第一次走進這家餐廳
This is the first time I've been here since my nanny died.

95
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,740
這話你已經在墨西哥快餐店說過了
You just said that at Chipotle.

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,580
然后十分鐘后  你又說了一遍
And then you said it again ten minutes later,

97
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,990
也是在那家快餐店
also at chipotle.

98
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,570
有點同情心好嗎
Show some sensitivity.

99
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,770
我當時哭是因為我保姆死了
I was crying because my nanny died.

100
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,730
也因為我們悼念的早午餐是在一家快餐店
And also because our grief brunch was at Chipotle.

101
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,360
卡洛琳  你的保姆過世啦
Caroline, your nanny passed?

102
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,530
我深表同情  寶貝  太遺憾了
My sympathies, sweetheart. That's a shame.

103
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,000
但沒有什么比黑人葬禮更棒的了
But there is nothing better than a black funeral.

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,410
我1984年時參加了我爺爺的葬禮  至今宿醉未醒
I'm still hung over from my grandpa's in '84.

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,740
厄爾  我的保姆是白人
Earl, my nanny was white.

106
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,920
你的保姆居然是白人
Your nanny was white?

107
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,520
小姑娘  你的確是富二代啊
Child, you were rich.

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,730
你看見阿憨了嗎
Have you seen Han?

109
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,070
葬禮明天在費城舉行
The funeral's in Philadelphia tomorrow,

110
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,350
我得跟他請一天假
and I need the day off.

111
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,810
我之前好像看見他了
Well, I think I saw him earlier.

112
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,250
但話說回來  那也有可能是一只貓
But then again, it might have been a cat.

113
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,330
我們倆都需要請一天假
Hey, we both need the day off.

114
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,310
我要陪你去  無論是出于精神支持
I'm going with you for moral support/

115
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,480
還是為了吃第一個費城牛肉三明治
my first cheesesteak/

116
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,960
或我想使勁甩獨立鐘里面的那個大球
I want to ride the liberty bell like a wrecking ball.

117
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,160
我剛在《科技新時代》看到一篇超級瘋狂的文章
I just read the craziest article in this Popular Science

118
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,600
是關于"白矮"星  黑"洞"和天王星[你屁眼]
about White Dwarfs, black holes, and Uranus.

119
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,770
不對  讓我重新說一遍
Oh, no. Let me start over.

120
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,300
阿憨  我們明天要請假  我保姆過世了
Han, we need tomorrow off. My nanny died.

121
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,730
她就像是我的母親
She was like a mother to me.

122
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,970
但她不是你的母親
But she was not your mother.

123
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,470
餐廳有明確的規定
And diner rules clearly state

124
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,060
必須是自己家人的葬禮才能請假
you can only take off for the death of a family member.

125
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,860
餐廳還規定不許在上班時候喝酒呢
Well, the rules also say no drinking on the job,

126
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,310
但現在
but...

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
好吧  你可以去
Okay, yes, you can go.

128
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,140
因為在我們國家
Because in my culture,

129
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,950
對長輩是十分尊敬的
it's important to honor the elderly.

130
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,720
我跟一位97的老人同睡上下鋪
I shared a bunk bed with a 97-year-old

131
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,980
一直睡到我22歲呢
till I was 22.

132
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,780
敢問你是在"上面"還是"下面"
Were you on the top or bottom?

133
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,750
我向來是在下面啊
Oh, I was always the bottom.

134
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,260
不對  讓我重新說一遍
Oh, no. Let me start over.

135
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,940
卡洛琳
Hey, Caroline.

136
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,010
我收到你保姆過世的短信了
I got your nanny death text.

137
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,360
所以我出于尊重  穿上了一身黑
So I'm wearing black out of respect.

138
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,510
而且  剛好我的月事也來了
And also, I got my period.

139
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
謝謝  蘇菲  太有愛了
Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely.

140
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,730
是嗎  哪部分
It is? Which part?

141
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,520
在波蘭  我保姆死的時候
You know, back in Poland when my nanny died,

142
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,030
我心都碎了  難過得都吃不下她了
I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her.

143
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,940
你居然吃你死掉的保姆
You ate your dead nanny?

144
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,470
山羊終究是動物
Well, a goat's a goat.

145
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,200
稱呼改變不了本質
It doesn't matter what you name it.

146
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,710
它仍是美味的羊肉
It's still good goat meat.

147
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
好了  我去我卡座里坐著了
All right, I'll be in my booth.

148
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,430
一份金槍魚三明治和三顆痛經藥  謝謝
I'm going to order a tuna melt and three Midol, please.

149
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,670
等等  我們要怎么去費城啊
Wait, how are we gonna get there?

150
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,240
碧碧說她有車  我們可以問問她
Oh, Bebe said she had a car, we can just ask her.

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,550
我不想跟她坐同一輛車
I don't want to get in a car with her.

152
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,120
我連跟她說話都不想
I don't even want to get in a conversation with her.

153
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,830
我可以載你們去
I can drive you.

154
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,120
但我們得先去我巴克斯縣的姐姐家
We just have to stop at my sister's in Bucks County,

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,530
拿一個沒有任何標記的包裹
pick up an unmarked package,

156
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,460
然后再送到康乃迪克州
and swing by Connecticut to drop it off.

157
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,860
奧列格  這個包裹里有違法的東西嗎
Oleg, is there anything illegal about this delivery?

158
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,680
沒有  只是几雙鞋
No, it's just some shoes...

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,900
里面塞滿可卡因而已
stuffed with cocaine.

160
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,860
對了  鞋子是用印度大麻做的哦
Also the shoes are made of hashish.

161
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
我還是打給碧碧好了
I'll call Bebe.

162
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,760
好吧  但我要坐后座
Okay, but I'm sitting in the back

163
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,930
因為我不想沾染到她的瘋氣
'cause I don't want the crazy to get on me.

164
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,170
碧碧  你送我們去葬禮
Bebe, I can't thank you enough

165
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,220
真是太感謝你了
for driving us to the funeral.

166
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,150
現在車速才20邁  其實你可以開快點的
We're only going 20. You can go faster if you want.

167
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,670
是啊  剛有一棵樹超過了我們
Yeah, we just got passed by a tree.

168
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,720
你那只愛放屁和神經緊張的可卡犬
And I'm especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,590
也跟著來  真讓我尤為振奮
with gas and hot spots got to join us.

170
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,210
夠了  你現在都開到100邁了
Okay, now you're going 100.

171
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,140
其實你可以開慢點的
We can go slower if you want.

172
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,660
抱歉  我的專長是做事極端
Sorry. Extremes-- that's my thing.

173
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,090
有一次我搬家到東京住了一天
One time I moved to Tokyo for a day.

174
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,560
-麥克斯  又來了  -我知道
- Max, it just hit me again. - I know.

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,080
貌似她給那只狗吃了西蘭花
It's like she feeds him broccoli.

176
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,000
不是啦
No.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
是我又想到安東尼婭真的去世了
That Antonia is really dead.

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,800
好消息是  根據點評網
Well, the good news is, according to Yelp,

179
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
她葬禮距離最出名的那家
she's dead about two blocks

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,560
費城牛肉奶酪三明治只有兩個街區
From the famous philly cheesesteak place.

181
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
麥克斯  放尊重點行嗎
Max, show some respect.

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,170
我又不認識她
Well, I didn't know her.

183
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,760
老實說  我只當她是幫我和牛肉三明治
In fact, I only know her as the lady who brought me

184
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,080
牽紅線的媒人
and cheesesteaks together.

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,290
即使我們從未見過面  但對于安東尼婭的家人來說
Even though we've never met, it'll mean so much

186
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,370
我的出席對他們來說意義重大
to Antonia's family that I came out of respect.

187
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,800
對我的心理醫生來說也意義重大
It'll mean so much to my therapist

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,970
因為我離開我的安全區
that I left my safe zone

189
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,270
還只帶了一條狗
and only brought one of the dogs.

190
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,790
麥克斯  你覺得除了我的悼詞之外
Max, do you think in addition to my eulogy,

191
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,130
我還應該念几段我兒時的日記嗎
I should read something from my childhood journal?

192
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,850
不應該  但我覺得你還是會執意念
I don't, but I think you're gonna do it anyway.

193
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,580
"1997年  聖誕節早上
"Christmas morning, 1997.

194
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,730
安東尼婭用一杯熱可可和一根我最愛的
Antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa

195
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,290
薄荷棒棒糖叫醒我
and my favorite peppermint stick,

196
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,310
然后我們開始拆禮物"
and then we opened presents."

197
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,300
1997年  聖誕節早上
Christmas morning, 1997.

198
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,580
我沖我媽臉上潑了一杯冰水
I threw cold water on my mother's face.

199
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,200
直到元旦那天  她人還是沒反應
New year's day-- still no movement.

200
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,530
這是我手上唯一一張我們的合影
This is the only picture I still have of us.

201
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,560
那是我們一起過的第一個萬聖節
It was our first Halloween together.

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,830
我當時四歲
I was four.

203
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,410
瞧她給我做的那身可愛的小雞裝束
Look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me.

204
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,950
唧唧  唧唧
Peep, peep.

205
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,200
真可愛
Aw, so cute.

206
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,150
看車
Car.

207
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,780
我從來沒穿過萬聖節服裝
I never had a Halloween costume.

208
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,770
我通常是把頭發亂糟糟地扎起來
I used to put my hair in a messy bun

209
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,000
然后跌跌撞撞地挨家挨戶敲門
and stumble from door-to-door

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,260
告訴大家我就是我媽
telling people I was my mother.

211
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,210
今年萬聖節  我打扮成我的醫生邁克
This Halloween, I went as my doctor, Michael.

212
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,740
我把我的狗狗打扮成
And I dressed up my buddy here

213
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,800
他的愛人  約瑟夫
As his lover, Joseph.

214
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
我們后來情不自禁
We lost.

215
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,780
安東尼婭一直陪在我身邊
Antonia was always there for me--

216
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,170
萬聖節  聖誕節  復活節  每一個節日
Halloween, Christmas, Easter-- every holiday.

217
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,710
每一天
Really, every day.

218
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,760
她就像我媽媽一樣
She was really like a mother to me.

219
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,330
那你真正的媽媽呢
Where was your real mother?

220
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,640
這只是什么品種的狗啊
Hey, what kind of dog is that?

221
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,370
除了"苦瓜臉品種"外
I mean, besides "Sad"?

222
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,670
她媽媽跟人偷情  然后被掃地出門
Her mother had an affair, got pushed out.

223
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,030
那是她的痛處  所以別隨便碰
That's her hot spot, so don't lick it.

224
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,710
沒關系  麥克斯  我不需要任何保護
It's okay, Max, I don't need any protection.

225
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,060
你不需要任何保護[措施]
You don't need protection?

226
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,180
你是誰  跟我約過會的男人嗎
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

227
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,730
碧碧  沒錯  我媽媽是背叛了我爸爸
Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful to my father,

228
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,730
所以她被趕走了
so she was sent away.

229
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,290
但我有安東尼婭  她照顧我
But I had Antonia and she took care of me.

230
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,810
她就是我的家人
She was my family.

231
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,060
那一定很難熬  人人都需要媽媽
That must have been hard. Everybody needs a mother.

232
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,690
我沒有我媽  一定會瘋掉的
I'd be crazy without my mother.

233
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,400
我看病都是她載我去的
She drives me to all my appointments.

234
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,910
但你不是會開車嗎
But you drive.

235
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,640
是啊
Yeah...

236
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,940
但醫生不讓我開
But I'm not supposed to.

237
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,520
我讓碧碧在車里等著沒事吧
It's okay I asked Bebe to wait in the car, right?

238
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,950
她不會憋死的  有扇車窗留了一條縫
I mean, she'll be okay. We cracked a window.

239
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,000
是啊  她有個碗和一個寵物用咀嚼玩具
Yeah, and she's got a bowl and a chew-toy.

240
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,740
來吧  過來簽到
Come on, let's sign in.

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,930
麥克斯  當我見到她家人時  我要振作
Max, I have to keep it together when I meet the family.

242
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,990
我不能太動情
I can't be all emotional.

243
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,370
瞧  我的手在抖  太可怕了
Look, my hand's shaking. This is terrible.

244
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,370
干嘛  剛才的簽名丑死了
What? It was a terrible signature.

245
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,800
而且那頁也只有五個其他人的名字而已
And there were only five other names on the page.

246
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,110
處理掉它
Get rid of it.

247
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,500
"處理掉它"
"Get rid of it"?

248
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,770
你是誰  跟我約過會的男人嗎
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

249
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,500
"卡洛琳﹒錢寧"
"Caroline Channing."

250
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,140
給  麥克斯
Here, Max.

251
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,730
瞧
Oh, look.

252
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,500
這里的花和一切都好美
The flowers and everything are so beautiful.

253
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,060
好了
There you go.

254
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,570
你居然簽"費成﹒三明智"
You signed "Phil E. Cheesesteak"?

255
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,470
你告訴我不要再提這件事了
You told me not to mention it anymore,

256
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,600
所以那只是個提醒而已
so it's just a reminder.

257
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,900
麥克斯  到時候一定會有很多人
Okay, Max, there are gonna be a lot of people

258
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,140
想要得到我的關注  所以拜托要耐心
who will want my attention, so please be patient

259
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,450
站在我身邊  偶爾給我支持的依靠
and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean.

260
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,020
如果有人開始哭得太夸張
And if someone starts to get too weepy,

261
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,970
立刻把他們從我身上拉開
push them out of the way

262
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,260
因為這條裙子可不能沾上眼淚
because I can't get tears on this dress.

263
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,670
我明天九點前還得退給百貨公司
It has to be back to Barneys by 9:00 A.M.

264
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,380
你來了
You're here.

265
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,170
開始了  麥克斯
Here we go, Max.

266
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,990
我剛是跟他說話
I was talking to him.

267
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,040
當然當然  今天對我們來說都很傷心
Of course you were. It's a very sad day for us all.

268
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,600
真是太傷了
That was rough.

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,790
麥克斯  看
Max, look.

270
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,400
這就是安東尼婭
This is Antonia.

271
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,960
她看起來人很好
She looks really nice.

272
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,540
的確
She was.

273
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,550
原來她還在軍隊待過
I didn't know she was in the military.

274
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,650
{\an8}美軍規定床單要掖進床墊下  四個角要折成45度

275
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,650
難怪床單四個邊角弄得那么利落
But it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners.

276
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,780
等等  你居然不知道你的保姆是海軍嗎
Wait, you didn't know your nanny was a marine?

277
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,490
真是太糟糕了  如果是我就會炫耀
That's too bad, 'cause I'd be all,

278
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,570
"喂  其他有錢的小屁孩
"Yo, other little rich kid!

279
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,070
老娘的保姆能輕易折斷你們脖子哦"
My nanny can snap your neck."

280
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,210
瞧  那倆是她的姐妹  塞西莉亞和安吉拉
Oh, look. There are her sisters, Cecelia and Angela,

281
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,780
這几個是她的侄子和侄女
and there are her nieces and nephews.

282
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,950
這些照片居然沒一張有我
And there is not me anywhere.

283
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
我的照片肯定跟其他重要人物
You know, my picture must be in the coffin

284
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,960
一起放在棺材里
With the other V.I.P.S.

285
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,090
如果你是個重要人物  能叫人上酒嗎
If you're a V.I.P., can we get some bottle service?

286
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,130
下午好  女士們
Good afternoon, ladies.

287
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,810
我是安東尼  安東尼婭的侄子
I'm Anthony, Antonia's nephew.

288
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,190
真是令人難過的一天
It's sad day, huh?

289
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,210
沒錯
Yes, it is.

290
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,970
我覺得我現在也沒這么難過了
Think I just got a little less sad.

291
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,060
安東尼
Oh! Anthony!

292
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,780
住手  我們可是一家人
Stop. We're family.

293
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,520
我是卡洛琳﹒錢寧
I'm Caroline Channing.

294
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,100
我只知道你是卡洛琳辣妹
You're Caroline "Hot," is all I know.

295
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,750
你們倆是要用信封裝錢
You ladies need cash envelopes

296
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,330
還是要不要都行
or you guys cool?

297
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,970
我最缺的就是裝錢的信封了
I always need a cash envelope.

298
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,800
抱歉  信封要拿來裝什么啊
I'm sorry, envelopes for what?

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,020
根據意大利葬禮的習俗  哀悼者瞻仰死者遺容后
Well, at Italian wakes, the mourners give the family

300
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,290
會捐一點錢給死者家屬
a donation after they view the deceased.

301
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,180
所以是要"按次收費"瞻仰嗎
So it's pay-per-view?

302
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,080
這句吐槽太犀利了
That was a good one.

303
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,740
晚點要一起喝一杯嗎
Hey, you want to go get a pop later?

304
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,410
我們完事就走了  但好吧  安東尼
We're leaving right after, but yes, Anthony.

305
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,380
謝謝  麻煩給我們個信封
Thank you. We'll take an envelope.

306
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,090
遺體就在前面
The body's right through there.

307
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,850
一直往前走
Go right ahead.

308
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,270
安東尼  住手
Anthony, stop.

309
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,500
我真的好緊張啊
I'm really nervous.

310
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,340
我以前從來沒見過尸體
I've never seen a dead body before.

311
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,530
我見多了
I've seen a bunch.

312
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,460
有几具還是拜我所賜
A couple of them were my fault.

313
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,550
我沒有現金
I don't have any cash.

314
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,200
-你有帶錢嗎  -我看看我的錢包
- Do you have any money? - Let me check my wallet.

315
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,910
這是名牌密封塑膠袋  可不是什么山寨貨哦
This is a real Ziploc, not one of those knock-offs.

316
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
一定要把信封封好
Make sure you seal the envelope,

317
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,710
好讓別人覺得里面都是25美分的硬幣
so people think it's all quarters.

318
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,890
麥克斯  下一個到我們了
Max, we're next.

319
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,310
我好害怕  牽住我的手
I'm afraid. Hold my hand.

320
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,680
牽手  你以為我們是什么
Hold hands? What are we?

321
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,140
基督徒約會網站上第五次約會的男女嗎
On a ChristianMingle fifth date?

322
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,140
{\an8}該網站是最大的信仰性在線約會網站之一

323
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,630
拜托了  麥克斯  我好緊張啊
Please, Max. I'm nervous.

324
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,840
-天啊  -謝謝
- Oh, God. - Thank you.

325
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
好了  松手
Okay. Now give it back.

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
干嘛  這已經是我維持最長的一段感情了
What? That was just my longest relationship.

327
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,600
再說了  我得把這些零錢放進信封里
Plus, I need it to put this change in the envelope.

328
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,360
她看起來一臉平靜
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

329
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
安東尼婭  我是卡洛琳
Hi, Antonia. It's me, Caroline.

330
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,070
我應該親她嗎  她家人在旁邊看著呢
Should I kiss her? The family is right there watching.

331
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,040
前面那個女士就親了
The lady before us kissed her.

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,130
親吧  反正看樣子她也不會推開你
Go for it. Doesn't look like she'd fight you.

333
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,740
好的  數到三
Okay, on the count of three.

334
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,060
一  二
One, two--

335
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,510
不行  麥克斯  牽著我的手
No! Max, hold my hand again while I--

336
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,810
我們該怎么辦
What do we do?

337
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,840
住手  別撿了  反正我們也要給她家人的
Wait, leave it! We were giving it to them anyway.

338
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,340
不是全部都給啊  那可是我們買三明治的錢
Not all of it. That's our cheesesteak money.

339
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,190
別撿了  快過來
Leave it. Come on.

340
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,510
剛才的事真是非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry about that.

341
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,120
我實在是太緊張了  你懂的
My nerves got the best of me. You understand.

342
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,060
我是塞西莉亞  安東尼婭的
I'm Cecelia, Antonia's--

343
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,410
妹妹  我知道
Sister. I know.

344
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,130
你們倆長得很像
I see the resemblance.

345
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,310
我是卡洛琳
I'm Caroline.

346
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,670
誰啊  卡洛琳
Caroline who?

347
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,870
卡洛琳﹒錢寧啊
Oh. Caroline Channing.

348
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,280
誰是卡洛琳﹒錢寧
Caroline Channing who?

349
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,500
你現在心情不好想不起  可以理解
You're having a hard time processing. Understandable.

350
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,690
今天對我們所有人來說都非常難過
It's been a very emotional day for us all.

351
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,420
這個女孩是誰
Who is this girl?

352
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,650
你  我倒覺得我在哪里見過你
You, I feel like I've seen somewhere.

353
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,810
你是里基在羅徹斯特的女友嗎
Are you Ricky's girl From Rochester?

354
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,580
有可能  是的話對我有什么好處
I could be. What's in it for me?

355
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,490
安東尼婭在我小時候照顧過我
Antonia used to take care of me when I was little.

356
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,900
安東尼婭是你的臨時保姆啊
Oh, Antonia was your baby-sitter.

357
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,080
你能來真好
Very nice of you to come.

358
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,670
她不是我的"臨時保姆"
Well, she was hardly my "baby-sitter."

359
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,360
她十年來的每一天都在照顧我
She took care of me every day for ten years.

360
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,720
我是卡洛琳  卡洛琳﹒錢寧啊
Caroline. Caroline Channing.

361
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,920
很抱歉  但我真不認識你  親愛的
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, sweetheart,

362
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,760
雖然你一直在向我施壓  逼我假裝認識你
Though it seems to be what you're hammering me about.

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,780
容我失陪一下
If you'll excuse me,

364
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,580
我要去抽根煙
I need a cigarette.

365
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,880
抽完了我還得去撿
And then I got to remove

366
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,450
掉在我姐姐身上的鋼圜
some of those pennies off of my sister.

367
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,260
那是口棺材  不是什么許愿井
It's a coffin, not a wishing well.

368
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,690
這個葬禮變得好令人感到沉重[沮喪]
This funeral turned out to be very depressing.

369
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,550
沒錯
Well, yeah.

370
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,320
有個死人躺在這里  不死氣沉沉都難
Dead body in the room, generally a buzz-kill.

371
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,140
除非這是愛爾蘭式守靈
Unless it's an Irish wake--

372
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,720
這樣你就可以隔著棺材玩啤酒乒乓啦
then you're playing beer pong off the coffin.

373
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,720
{\an8}愛爾蘭人愛喝酒  啤酒乒乓是一種喝酒游戲

374
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,010
我的意思是  這家人
No, I mean, how is it possible

375
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,730
怎么可能沒一個人認識我呢
that the family doesn't even know me?

376
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,860
難道安東尼婭從來沒提起過我嗎
Did Antonia never even mention me?

377
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,380
你應該往好的方面想
Let's focus on the positive.

378
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,640
安東尼真的很喜歡你的小屁屁
Anthony really liked your ass.

379
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,000
我知道我和安東尼婭擁有過什么
I know what Antonia and I had.

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
這就是我們擁有的回憶
This is what we had.

381
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,760
唧唧  唧唧
Peep, peep.

382
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,290
那是我們的美好回憶
That's what we had.

383
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,270
那已經很多啦
Well, that's a lot.

384
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,280
但我猜這家人不會承認我們的回憶
But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that,

385
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,390
這真是太遺憾了
and it's a shame too,

386
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,260
因為我准備了很棒的悼詞
because I had a great eulogy.

387
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,020
是嗎
You do?

388
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,000
是的  沒錯
Yes. I do.

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,540
你想讓我跟你分享嗎
Would you like me to share it with you?

390
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,140
當然想啊
I most certainly would.

391
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,610
你不是真的要拿你的爛悼詞
You are not seriously eulogy-bombing

392
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,660
去精神轟炸那位老太太吧
that old lady, are you?

393
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,730
是她先問起我的悼詞的
She asked me about my great eulogy.

394
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,630
她都一百歲了
She's a hundred.

395
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,090
很可能聽成你說你有一位很棒的泌尿科醫生
She probably thought you said you had a great urologist.

396
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,060
你有筆嗎
Do you have a pen?

397
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,740
我要記下她醫生的名字
I'm getting the name of her doctor.

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,590
不  夫人  我說的不是"泌尿科醫生"
No, ma'am, I didn't say, "urologist."

399
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,530
我說的是"悼詞"  很棒的悼詞[音似]
I said, "eulogy." A great eulogy.

400
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,990
你憑啥上去念悼詞啊
Why would you give the eulogy?

401
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,310
因為我是卡洛琳﹒錢寧
Because I'm Caroline Channing.

402
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,910
誰呀
Who?

403
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,190
卡洛琳﹒錢寧
Caroline Channing.

404
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,290
卡洛琳﹒錢寧
Caroline Channing.

405
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,500
安東尼婭是我的保姆
Antonia was my nanny.

406
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,760
我家過去超級有錢
My family was rich,

407
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,380
但后來我父親騙走了全世界的錢
but then my father robbed everyone,

408
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,800
于是我們淪為害群之馬
and we became the scourge of society,

409
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,530
同一周  梅爾﹒吉布森仇視猶太人的言論
overshadowed a little bit by Mel Gibson

410
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,090
蓋過了我家丑聞風頭一點點
hating the Jews that same week.

411
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,360
你們絕對應該記得
Surely, you remember?

412
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,370
小寶貝  我連怎么來這里的都不記得了
Honey, I don't even remember how I got here.

413
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,530
真是難以置信
I can't believe this.

414
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,010
我整個童年之所以"快樂"都是因為
I constructed my entire "Happy" Childhood

415
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,590
我堅信  就算我媽離開了我
On the fact that even though my mom left

416
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,130
就算她不愛我
and apparently didn't love me,

417
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,790
但還有安東尼婭愛我
Antonia did.

418
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,520
而我來了這里  我意識到
And now I get here and I realize

419
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,800
沒人愛過我  她只是為了掙錢
no one loved me, I was just a paycheck.

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,290
我只是她照顧的眾多小孩中的一個
One of the many kids she baby-sat.

421
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,060
我甚至不知道我來這里的意義是什么
I don't even know why I bothered to come.

422
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,060
我去一趟洗手間  然后我們就走
I'm going to the restroom and then we can just leave.

423
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,780
打擾一下  你好
Excuse me. Hi.

424
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,870
我是麥克斯  里基的女友
Max, Ricky's girl.

425
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,440
我知道現在你很難過
I know this is a hard time for you,

426
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,520
但對我朋友來說  她也很難過
but it's a hard time for my friend as well.

427
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,150
即使你從來沒有聽說過她
And even though you never heard of her,

428
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,590
但我懇請你能否過去
I was wondering if you could just go over there,

429
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,630
對她說你想起來了
and say you just remembered her,

430
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,840
安東尼婭經常在你們面前提起她
and that Antonia talked about her all the time?

431
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,220
我明白這是要你說謊推翻你之前的話
I know it's a 180 on your original story and a lie,

432
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,480
我也樂意給你辛苦費
and I'd offer to pay you for your trouble,

433
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,950
但我的養老金全在裝著你姐姐的盒子里了
but my 401k is laying in that box on top of your sister.

434
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,180
我是看在你男人里基的面子  才沒趕你倆走
Look, I only permitted you two to stay

435
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,230
要不是去年喬舅舅從樓頂摔下來時  
'cause your Ricky was so nice to uncle Joe

436
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,170
全靠他出手相救
when he fell off the roof last year.

437
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,860
但現在  你們還是離開這吧
But now, you gotta go.

438
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,040
好吧  隨便你好了
Okay. Be that way.

439
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,470
但下次喬舅舅要去做透析時  里奇不會去接他的
But don't expect Ricky to pick up Uncle Joe for dialysis.

440
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,450
麥克斯  你這是干什么
Max, what are you doing?

441
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,040
是那家人讓我貼上去的
The family asked me to put it up.

442
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,810
他們想起你來了
They just remembered you.

443
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,000
天啊
Oh, my God.

我有這么可悲嗎  需要你粘照片
I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture

445
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,900
來哄我嗎
to make me feel better?

446
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,730
在某種程度上  是的
In a way, yes.

447
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,030
這照片本來就應該貼在這里
It belongs up there.

448
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,470
誰不想會認識這個孩子啊
Who wouldn't want to know that kid?

449
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,930
很高興見到你  安東尼婭
Nice to meet you, Antonia.

450
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,810
千萬不要做鬼來找我們

Max, please take that down.

453
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,350
太丟臉了
It's so embarrassing.

454
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,710
這里沒人認識我
Nobody here knows anything about me.

455
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,190
他們也不認識我啊  小雞仔
They didn't know me either, chicken.

456
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,210
你叫誰小雞仔呢
Hey, who you callin' chicken?

457
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,290
我  那是安東尼婭給我起的昵稱
Me. That was Antonia's nickname for me.

458
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,520
你知道我是誰嗎
You know who I am?

459
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,800
我當然知道
Of course I do.

460
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
安東尼婭的小雞仔  她的小唧唧
Antonia's little chick, her peep.

她也喜歡給你做那套裝束
And she loved making you that costume.

463
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,960
整個廚房餐桌上全鋪滿了亮片
Took the whole kitchen table up with all those sequins,

464
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,350
她知道你就該是最耀眼的那一個
But she knew you deserved to sparkle.

465
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,850
她非常愛你  我根本沒辦法抱怨
She loved you so much, I couldn't begin to complain.

466
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,380
不好意思  請問您是哪位

我是梅格﹒歐哈拉  我是她的室友

兼愛人

469
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,410
我們在一起30年了
We were together 30 years.

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,280
軍隊拉拉情
The military!

471
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,410
沒錯  明眼人一看就知道了
I know, right? I mean, come on.

472
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,070
當時在坦克那  我的手可是摟著她啊
That's me with my arm around her on that tank.

473
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,380
而那一家子蠢蛋卻還是看不出來
And the family still had no clue.

474
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,410
老一代蕾絲邊  超級酷啊

你大概是這世界上唯一一個
You're probably the only person in the world

478
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,270
對她的愛像我一樣純粹的人了

00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,170
節哀順變
I'm sorry for your loss.

484
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,510

費城牛肉奶酪三明治  人人有份啦

486
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,460
我終于活過來了
And you really haven't lived

487
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,280
之前在雪弗蘭里跟九個牛肉三明治
until you've driven two hours in a Chevy

488
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,190
和一只愛放屁的動物待了兩個小時  都要死了
with nine cheesesteaks and a gassy animal.

489
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,620
這有啥  我不就在車上吃完了
What? I ate mine in the car.

490
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,590
厄爾  你錯過了一場精彩的葬禮

491
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,470
你真應該去的
You should have come.

492
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,820
那有不少八九十歲的老辣奶
There were some hot octogenarians,

493
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,970
而且我接收到其中一位超強的"求歡"信號
and I got a definite "jungle fever" vibe from one of them.

494
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,120
像我這種年紀的人  可不想在葬禮上出現
Girl, at my age, you don't go anywhere near funerals.

495
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,610
只要你一不小心打個瞌睡  就得花上六小時
You accidentally doze off, you spend six hours

496
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,910
把你自己從地里挖出來
digging yourself out of the ground.

497
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,230
你還好吧  小雞仔
Hey, how you holding up, chicken?

498
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,600
我沒事  多謝關心
I'm okay. Thanks.

499
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,920
麥克斯  我死的時候
And Max, when I die,

500
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,700
我不在乎我的葬禮都有誰出席
I don't care who else is at my funeral,

501
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,070
只要你來了就行
as long as you're there.

502
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,230
我當然會去
Of course I'll be there.

503
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,110
凶手向來為了甩掉警察而出席葬禮
The murderer always shows up to throw off the cops.

504
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,270
對了  棺材別花太多錢
Also, save the money on a casket

505
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,960
給我一套迪奧壽服  化煙熏妝  扔洞里就行了
and just toss me in a hole wearing Dior and a smoky eye.

506
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,510
如果到時我很胖  那就火葬了吧
Unless I'm fat-- then burn me.

507
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,120
我不想要葬禮
Well, I don't want a funeral.

508
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,410
等我死的時候  把我尸體塞進大炮里
When I die, just shove my corpse into a cannon

509
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,470
直接沖著大西洋城特朗普賭場來一發  送我過去
and blow me directly into the Trump casino.
