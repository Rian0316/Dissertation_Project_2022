1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,683
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:04,119
Mike's plan to
propose to Susan...

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:05,899
These things don't
belong to Jane.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,999
"Mike Delfino."

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,870
Was a surprise to Ian.

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,268
Monique was murdered...

7
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,346
There's been an accident.

8
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,600
-And Orson...
-Don't forget your wrench.

9
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:16,300
Passed the blame.

10
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,650
A connection was made...

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,900
A heart was broken...

12
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:26,519
And Bree buried
her husband Rex.

13
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,328
My name is
Rex Van De Kamp.

14
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,050
I always hated cemeteries
when I was alive.

15
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,401
Now that I'm dead,
I like 'em even less.

16
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:47,752
Here's where
I used to live.

17
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:49,832
A whole lot nicer,
don't you think?

18
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,702
The place hasn't changed
much since I left,

19
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,853
as tasteful
and tidy as ever.

20
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:57,803
Everything perfect...

21
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,701
at least on
the surface.

22
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,630
My family was
the same way.

23
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:04,300
Look at us.

24
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:07,403
You'd never guess how ticked off
we all were the day this was taken,

25
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:10,312
but that was the thing
about us Van De Kamps.

26
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,402
To really fit in,

27
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,401
you had to have a smile
that gave away nothing.

28
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,360
Like my son Andrew.

29
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,623
To look at him, you'd never know
he spent six months on the streets

30
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,991
supporting himself with
panhandling and light prostitution.

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,300
Or my daughter Danielle.

32
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,182
Does she look like
the kind of girl

33
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:32,493
who'd seduce her
middle-aged History teacher?

34
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:35,701
I mean, they're my kids,
and I love 'em,

35
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:38,200
but I'm pretty darn
relieved to be dead.

36
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,500
Here's the clown
Bree replaced me with,

37
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:44,203
Orson.

38
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,340
I don't mind saying,

39
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,500
he's creeped me out
right from the get-go.

40
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,301
To me, he always has
the shifty look of a guy

41
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,351
who knows where
the bodies are buried...

42
00:01:58,608 --> 00:01:59,810
and he should know.

43
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,543
He buried them.

44
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,803
But Bree thinks
he's sir Galahad.

45
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:06,972
The kids like him.

46
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,471
And all my friends...

47
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,231
now his friends.

48
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,661
So it pleases me to know that
at least one of my old neighbors

49
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,270
sees right
through the guy.

50
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,003
Mike, you just
missed Bree.

51
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,603
She's off to
see her folks,

52
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,701
and then we're finally
taking our honeymoon.

53
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,901
Yeah, not a bad time for
you to leave town, is it?

54
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,200
Well, I don't follow you.

55
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,700
I just keep thinking about
that night at Monique's place.

56
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,901
How you made sure
I left with my wrench.

57
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,901
The one with
her blood on it.

58
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,901
Well, it was
your wrench.

59
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,951
Why are you
rehashing this?

60
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,571
My ex-wife confessed
in her suicide note.

61
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,860
The case is closed.

62
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:50,722
Maybe it shouldn't be.

63
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,801
What do you think
the police would say

64
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:55,950
if they knew you were
there that night?

65
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:57,703
What do you
think they'd say

66
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,370
if they knew you
threw me off a roof?

67
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:03,703
Oh, Mike.

68
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,903
We could make so much
trouble for each other,

69
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,681
or we can forget what
we think we know

70
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,503
and be good neighbors.

71
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,601
Your call.

72
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:21,301
No, Orson Hodge
isn't exactly the guy

73
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,843
I'd have picked
to head my family,

74
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,102
but I'll give
him one thing...

75
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,332
He's got the smile
down cold.

78
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,633
Take a drive down
any street in suburbia.

79
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,212
You know what
you're gonna see?

80
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,501
Desperate women.

81
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,221
That's right.

82
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,452
One unhappy housewife
after another,

83
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,860
each completely
miserable...

84
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,602
in her own
unique way.

85
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,303
But I don't want
to talk about them.

86
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,701
No, I want to talk
about their men

87
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,692
and what
happens to a guy

88
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:43,103
when that special lady
in his life starts to lose it.

89
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:46,140
Like my friend Carlos.

90
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,350
He used to
have it all.

91
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,801
Hot wife, tons of dough,

92
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:52,401
then bam!

93
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,661
She gets a divorce, and
he gets stuck with the bill.

94
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,583
But does he sit
around and complain

95
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,142
like your average
hausfrau?

96
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,502
No, sir.

97
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,221
He finds creative ways

98
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,200
to get what you
can out of life.

99
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,513
Hey, bro!
Where you off to?

100
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:13,592
Oh, the hospital called.

101
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,712
They found the stuff I had on
me the night of the accident.

102
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,421
Coma, murder rap.
You've had a tough year, buddy.

103
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,803
You know what you need?
Some pampering.

104
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,063
Tomorrow you're checking
in to a nice hotel.

105
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,813
Room service,
jacuzzi, my treat.

106
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,023
You trying to get me
out of the house?

107
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,271
Mike, why would I...
Okay, there's this girl.

108
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:32,262
I knew it.

109
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:34,361
Dude, she's a dancer,

110
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,372
and if her online profile's
any indication,

111
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,872
she's a complete freak. We're
talking serious Daddy issues.

112
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,810
Look, I'll stay in my room.
You'll never hear me.

113
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,552
Yeah, but
you'll hear me.

114
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:47,072
I'm kind of exuberant by nature,
and when I haven't had it in a while,

115
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:48,931
I kind of do this shrieking
thing that, I mean, is kinda...

116
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,703
Okay. All right, I'll go.
Just stop talking.

117
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,360
Thanks, pal. I wouldn't want it
to put a weird spin on our friendship.

118
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,333
Too late.

119
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,841
This is my friend Tom.

120
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,570
Have you heard what
he's been up to lately?

121
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,192
This silly bastard opened up
his own pizza place.

122
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,722
He thought that
if he was his own boss,

123
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,991
he could sleep in
as late as he wanted,

124
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,372
but the problem with that
logic is that married guys...

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,002
Hey. It's after 9:00.

126
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,500
Come on, Thomasina,
it's time to get up.

127
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,302
Are never
their own boss.

128
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:25,041
Are you as
tired as I am?

129
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,640
More, but I'm tougher,
and I complain less.

130
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,700
Not when you give birth,
and you do that a lot.

131
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:32,882
Yeah?

132
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,740
Before I forget, you got
a call from Chez Nous

133
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:40,162
confirming your reservation
for our anniversary.

134
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,732
You heard that?
I wanted that to be a surprise.

135
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,160
Well, we've been going there
for the last seven years.

136
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,732
It's not exactly a surprise.

137
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,681
Anyway, I hope
you don't mind,

138
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:51,601
but I canceled.

139
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,611
You canceled? Why?

140
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:59,341
Honestly, I just don't feel up
to going out this year.

141
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,913
But it's our anniversary.
It's our ninth anniversary.

142
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:03,190
Come on.
The "big nine."

143
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:06,800
That's a year longer than my
Mom said we would be married.

144
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,650
Come on.
We gotta party down.

145
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:11,899
I'm exhausted.

146
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,128
Honestly, all I wanna do is pawn
the kids off on somebody else,

147
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,511
take a long bath
and be in bed by 8:00.

148
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:22,403
Okay.

149
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,482
Oh, thank you.

150
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,083
Thank you.
Thank you.

151
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,003
Hold it.

152
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:31,903
What about my sex?

153
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,201
I always get sex
on our anniversary.

154
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,731
We can still have sex.
Just try not to wake me.

155
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:43,970
This is Ian.

156
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,660
Don't really
know the guy,

157
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,803
but Susan Mayer
seems to like him.

158
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,733
The other night, he surprised
her with a proposal.

159
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:55,300
She said yes, but he's
still a little skittish

160
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,382
about the competition.

161
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,002
But Ian knows
that if love is war...

162
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:03,623
Hey. Where were you off
to so early this morning?

163
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,802
Sometimes you gotta bring
out the big artillery.

164
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,280
I should have had it
when I proposed.

165
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:12,883
It's not very good
form, I know.

166
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,402
Ian, oh,
you can't be serious.

167
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,501
Oh, that's just...
too much.

168
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:20,370
It's huge.

169
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,871
Well, we could go smaller.

170
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,653
Oh, no. No one's saying smaller.
No, that's crazy talk.

171
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:30,203
Rock me.

172
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,502
Oh, my!
Oh, it's so beautiful!

173
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:40,902
Oh, okay.
Okay, nobody move.

174
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:46,281
I got it.

175
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:47,853
I knew I should have
measured your finger.

176
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,900
No, it's okay.
I can get it resized.

177
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:52,192
You should go to the
jeweler's right now,

178
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,920
and when you get back, we can go and
look at some places for the reception.

179
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:55,941
Reception?

180
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:58,432
Yes, I was hoping we could pull
this together for next month.

181
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,360
What's the rush?
Am I pregnant?

182
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,193
Of course not.

183
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,902
I just, well, I just can't
wait to be married to you.

184
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:05,901
Are you sure?

185
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,751
'Cause you seem
a little anxious.

186
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,853
What would I have
to be anxious about?

187
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:17,580
Again,
sorry for the mix-up.

188
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,042
If you could just
sign right here...

189
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,933
I don't remember this.

190
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,391
You sure that's mine?

191
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,221
It was on you the night
you were admitted.

192
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,520
I got hit by a car.

193
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,010
I don't remember anything
about that night.

194
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,721
Well, it looks like you were
gonna propose to someone.

195
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,333
"Susan, be mine
forever. Mike."

196
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:39,581
Does that ring a bell?

197
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:45,941
Sure does.

198
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,422
Hey, Carlos.

199
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:52,390
Hi.

200
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:53,872
I have a little visitor

201
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,702
that I thought you might
get a kick out of seeing.

202
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,522
Remember my little boy?

203
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:01,401
Hey, Travers. How you
doing? Put her there.

204
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:03,171
I'm Carlos Solis.

205
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,502
I think you came by my house
one time trick-or-treating.

206
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:08,503
I remember.
You gave me a protein bar.

207
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:09,832
Right.

208
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,100
Sorry. My wife
forgot to buy candy.

209
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,321
Hey, is that football I hear?

210
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,613
Go on.
Check it out.

211
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,193
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

212
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,661
Neither did I.

213
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:30,702
His father just dumped him
here for four weeks

214
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:33,891
so he could jet off with his
doctors without borders buddies

215
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,103
and fix cleft
palates in Kenya.

216
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,803
Selfish son of a bitch.

217
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,440
Come on. I mean,
you barely even see him.

218
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,360
It'll be fun.
A chance to bond.

219
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:44,112
Yeah, that's true,
but, um...

220
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:47,013
I have this major
party tonight,

221
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:51,111
and I was wondering if maybe you could
just keep an eye on him for a few hours.

222
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,040
Sorry. I can't tonight.

223
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:55,112
Come on! You love kids.

224
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,692
I mean, didn't you rent
that chinese chick

225
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,163
so that you could have
one of your own?

226
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,672
I have a date, too,

227
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,203
with a chick so hot I had to turn off
the smoke alarms in my house.

228
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:04,292
Fine.

229
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:07,022
Travers, come on.
Let's go.

230
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:12,070
This isn't
a child-friendly house.

231
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:16,601
Bye, Travers.

232
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:29,901
Wow, she's a looker.

233
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,903
I'll say.

234
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,110
Hey, what time's
that fund-raiser?

235
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,122
You got an hour.

236
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:37,902
Well, then...

237
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:39,713
Let's have
a little fun.

238
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,730
Look what you did!

239
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,680
Don't yell at me.
I'm just a passenger.

240
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:58,190
Well, your driver's an idiot!

241
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,701
Hey, it's not
Clyde's fault.

242
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:02,562
I mean, what man wouldn't be
distracted by such beauty?

243
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,610
Now you're
hitting on me?

244
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,843
I was talking
about the car.

245
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:10,563
Well, good.
I'm glad you like it,

246
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,003
'cause you're gonna
pay to fix this.

247
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,301
Of course.
$5,000 cover it?

248
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:16,143
Five?

249
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,303
Well, sure, I guess.

250
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,400
I'd rather not file
an insurance claim.

251
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,910
My opponent could find out
and try to make me look bad.

252
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:24,882
Opponent?

253
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,501
Oh, well, I guess you
don't read the papers.

254
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,802
I'm running for mayor.
My name's Victor Lang,

255
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:30,790
and I hope I can
count on your vote.

256
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,591
I think I'd rather vote
for the other guy.

257
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,443
You know, the one
who didn't wreck my car?

258
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,772
you're off
your game.

259
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,053
You didn't even get
a phone number.

260
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,100
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be seeing her again.

261
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:50,033
How can you
be so sure?

262
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:51,993
I didn't sign
the check.

263
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,663
What the hell
are you doing?

264
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,660
We neeto talk.

265
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,890
No, we don't. Get out.

266
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,493
Please. You won't
return my calls.

267
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:10,403
Well, I've been busy.

268
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,370
Plus, my Mom caught you
naked on top of my friend.

269
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,902
Just read this, and if you
still don't want to talk to me,

270
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:19,562
then I'll never
bother you again.

271
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:22,101
Fine, I'll read it,

272
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,783
but only if you get out
of the car right now.

273
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,910
Now? But the hot
wax is starting.

274
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,081
I know.
Ticktock.

275
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,590
You're still in there?

276
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,480
How long does it take
to pluck that unibrow?

277
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,672
Leave me alone!

278
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,391
Danielle, I have to be
at work in ten minutes.

279
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,472
Now can I please just come
in and brush my teeth?

280
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,650
I'm having a really
bad day, all right?

281
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,001
Just go away!

282
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:56,693
I'm gonna have
a really bad day, too.

283
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,091
I tend not to get tipped
when my breath stinks.

284
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,690
I'm pregnant.

285
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,903
Mike, what are
you doing here?

286
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,953
Oh, hey, I'm just
selling some old jewelry.

287
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:23,250
I spoke to my manager.

288
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,711
There's gonna be a charge
to remove the inscription,

289
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,913
but we can refund you
for the engagement ring.

290
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:30,302
That'll be fine.

291
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,990
Was that the ring
that you bought for...

292
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:35,820
Yeah.

293
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:38,630
Can I help you?

294
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,441
Yeah, I have
to get this sized.

295
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,603
It's a little loose.

296
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:44,782
Do you know
your size?

297
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:45,532
No.

298
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,352
Congratulations,
by the way.

299
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:51,511
Ian... seems great.

300
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:53,402
Thanks.

301
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,541
I can't find my sizer.

302
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,610
Here.

303
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,180
-Try this one.
-Oh, no...

304
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,100
How's that fit?

305
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,821
It's perfect.

306
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:13,050
Great.

307
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,440
Can I have it back now?

308
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:23,692
Sorry.

309
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:36,760
Hey, you've got a cousin in
the limo business, don't you?

310
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:40,373
Actually, I've got a cousin In the "limo
as a front for prostitution" business.

311
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,433
He's in jail.
Why do you ask?

312
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:45,753
Oh, I'm just planning a big
thing for my anniversary.

313
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,131
Aren't you just gonna go to Chez
Boring, like you do every year?

314
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:48,822
No.

315
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,490
Lynette's so over that, she was
ready to bag the whole night,

316
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,041
so got me thinking.

317
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,892
Nine years.
Time to shake things up.

318
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:01,542
Now I'm planning the greatest
anniversary of all time.

319
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:04,831
Check this out.

320
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:08,063
Lynette's gonna open the
door to find a limo driver

321
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,823
with a dozen
roses and a card.

322
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,980
The card is gonna tell
her to go with the guy,

323
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,002
not ask any questions.

324
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:16,831
He'll drive her
out to the country.

325
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,072
He'll drop her off,

326
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,452
Then drive away.

327
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,130
Just as she is starting
to freak out,

328
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:25,930
I show up in a
horse-drawn carriage,

329
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,300
which takes us up
to Whitman's bluff,

330
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:30,603
where we eat
a catered dinner,

331
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,632
listen to
a professional violinist.

332
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,432
Afterwards,
when we come home,

333
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm sure Lynette will think
of a way to thank me.

334
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:43,383
You're one romantic
son of a bitch.

335
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,762
I have my moments.

336
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:50,272
Of course I'm not questioning
mayor Johnson's family values.

337
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,630
I'm sure they're what prompted him
to put his sisters, brother-in-law

338
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,362
and six of his cousins
on the city payroll.

339
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:02,002
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to cut this interview short.

340
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:04,720
I have some very important
business to attend to.

341
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:06,941
Ms. Solis,

342
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,933
What a nice surprise.

343
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,883
Are you here to make
a contribution to my campaign?

344
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:13,163
Not exactly.

345
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,660
Oh, no.
Did I forget to s...

346
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,291
I'm so sorry.

347
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:20,721
Let me make
it up to you.

348
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,062
I'll take you to dinner.
My treat.

349
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,301
It would be your treat.
I'm a hot date.

350
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:25,651
What's in it for me?

351
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,903
Well, I have, uh,
"an ingratiating wit,

352
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:30,872
trustworthy smile,"

353
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,741
According to the
"Plainview Herald."

354
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,740
Yeah. Check, please.

355
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:40,613
My family also owns
Lang Enterprises.

356
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,603
Dad's worth a...

357
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,181
few hundred mil.

358
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,442
Well, a girl's gotta eat.

359
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,242
Great. I'll take
you to Cucina.

360
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:56,943
There's no place
harder to get into.

361
00:17:58,306 --> 00:17:59,571
That's what you think.

362
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,700
Mike, this is completely
unnecessary.

363
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,753
My paying for your
lawyer was a favor.

364
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,740
It wasn't a loan.

365
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,302
I appreciate it, but I just
don't like to owe anybody.

366
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,372
Well, I just don't want you
to have any trouble

367
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:14,603
getting back
on your feet.

368
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,000
No, it's fine. I had a windfall.

369
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,853
The hospital
gave me back

370
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,960
an engagement ring
I didn't even know I had.

371
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:22,602
Oh, really?
So you sold it?

372
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:25,342
You should have kept it
till the right girl comes along.

373
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,232
Well, I...

374
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,241
couldn't give this ring
to just anyone.

375
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh, right, the, um,
the inscription.

376
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,041
How'd you know
it was inscribed?

377
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,603
Well, isn't that the custom?
I just assumed it was.

378
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,520
Well, listen, I've got
to get some fresh rags.

379
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,553
Thanks for the check.
I'll see you around.

380
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,882
Oh, you can
count on it.

381
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,040
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

382
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,461
I peed on five
different sticks.

383
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:05,303
Would you put that burrito away?
It's making me nauseous.

384
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,691
Join the club.

385
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,892
Look, I know your parents are
religious, but I know this clinic.

386
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,200
Absotely not!

387
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:12,750
So what other choice
do we have?

388
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,003
Well, gee, you could,
like, uh, marry me?

389
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,431
Marry you?!
I can't stand you.

390
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,020
Nice way to talk to the
mother of your child!

391
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,162
Oh, God.

392
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,413
Bathroom.

393
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:28,910
Hey.

394
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:30,182
Julie.

395
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,230
Hi. Uh, hey.

396
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,103
Your door was open.
Can I come in?

397
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:37,301
What are you
doing here?

398
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:38,542
I read your letter.

399
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,552
I had no idea
it would be so sweet.

400
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,042
I could really tell
it came from your heart.

401
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:49,623
I'm embarrassed
to admit, I...

402
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,553
cried.

403
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,622
My aunt Edie sort of
tied one on last night.

404
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,351
Anyway, I guess
what I'm saying is...

405
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:04,650
Okay.

406
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,152
"Okay"?

407
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,213
We can try again.

408
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,131
Julie, that's great!

409
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:11,910
And I want to
talk about this,

410
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:13,933
but I just kinda need
to take care of my aunt.

411
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:15,452
Can I call you
tomorrow?

412
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:16,482
Sure.

413
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,012
We're gonna have
to take things slow,

414
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,702
'cause it'll be a while
before I can trust you again.

415
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,103
I understand.

416
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,760
Thank you, Bruno.
The veal was excellent.

417
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,990
-Feel like dessert?
-No, thank you. I'm stuffed.

418
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:40,550
Then let me
propose a toast.

419
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,523
To a delightful evening,

420
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,773
and to the happy accident
that brought us together.

421
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:48,200
Victor, you are
so full of crap.

422
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:49,651
What?

423
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,272
There was no accident.

424
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,562
I know you told your
chauffeur to ram my car.

425
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:55,021
Why would I do that?

426
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,491
For the same reason you
"forgot" to sign the check.

427
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,492
You've been working me
since the second we met,

428
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,382
and I've been on to you
every step of the way.

429
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:06,643
What? What's so funny?

430
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,901
I just called you
a manipulative jerk.

431
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,812
I think
I underestimated you.

432
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,343
I also think this relationship
just got a lot more interesting.

433
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,541
There is no relationship.
This is our last date.

434
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,043
You didn't have any fun?

435
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,080
It was okay.

436
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:25,801
You know, you told a few good
jokes. you're sorta charming.

437
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:28,862
You're not bad-looking.
I just think I can do better.

438
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,153
Have you not noticed?
I'm a catch.

439
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,212
I have noticed,
and I'm throwing you back.

440
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,381
Gaby, let me tell
you something.

441
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,301
For my whole life,

442
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,831
whenever I've truly
wanted something,

443
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:43,500
I've always gotten it.

444
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,632
And tonight, right around the time
you were calling me a manipulative jerk,

445
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:51,660
I decided
I truly want you.

446
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,162
So brace yourself.

447
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,642
The chase is on.

448
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,351
You can chase me
all you want,

449
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:00,672
But trust me,

450
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,002
I'm way too
fast for you.

451
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:09,621
Bruno...

452
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,350
I'm gonna
marry that girl.

453
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:19,671
Can I just say
something?

454
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,503
You are way hotter
than your online profile.

455
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,250
So many guys say that.

456
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,752
What's wrong?

457
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:36,841
Oh, my friend's
kid is out there.

458
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,173
Hey, I got an idea.

459
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,950
Let's go upstairs.

460
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:56,493
I should warn you...

461
00:22:57,155 --> 00:23:00,701
My therapist says
I'm sexually compulsive.

462
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,482
This could take hours.

463
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,960
Whatever your issues are,
we will work them out together.

464
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,860
It's almost 11:00. What is
he doing out therby himself?

465
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,902
I'm sure his folks
know he's out there.

466
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,730
Now relax.

467
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:36,303
I'm so sorry. I will be
right back. I promise.

468
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:41,701
Hey, Travers, what are
you doing out here?

469
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:42,482
Where's your Mom?

470
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,293
She had to go
visit a sick friend.

471
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,251
Come on.

472
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,221
No way. I didn't come over here
to babysit some little brat.

473
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,392
-He can hear you.
-I don't care.

474
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:02,980
Look, his mother's bound
to be home soon, all right?

475
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,741
Then we can pick up
where we left off.

476
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:06,930
Forget it.

477
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,550
I'm officially
no longer in the mood.

478
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,802
Sorry I ruined
your date.

479
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,240
That's okay.

480
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,600
She was
a very bad lady

481
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,453
who wanted to do very,
very bad things to me.

482
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,332
Night, Raoul.

483
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,902
TON FILS EST CHEZ MOI. CARLOS.

484
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:55,791
-Where the hell have you been?
-Oh, I, uh...

485
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,402
ducked out...
just for an hour.

486
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,361
That's funny,

487
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,662
'cause I found Travers wandering
the streets three hours ago.

488
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:04,402
Look, he was
fine when I left.

489
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:06,671
I just didn't know
he'd go outside.

490
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,302
Yeah, you never know what
an 8 year old's gonna do.

491
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,712
That's why
you supervise him.

492
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,760
Hey, you don't get to judge me.
You don't have a kid.

493
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,022
Well, if I did,

494
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,181
I'd treat him a hell of
a lot better than you do.

495
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,472
Thank God he lives with
his father. I mean, come on.

496
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:20,983
What kind of
mother are you?

497
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,490
If you are done
lecturing me,

498
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:29,903
I would like
my son now.

499
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,411
He's asleep.

500
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:33,582
Come and get him
in the morning...

501
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:35,782
When you're sober.

502
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,461
Hey, buddy!

503
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:48,580
Your Mom's here for ya.

504
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,301
I know you think
I'm a terrible person.

505
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:55,263
I never said that.

506
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:59,102
Terrible mother, terrible person.
It's the same thing.

507
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,981
Because no matter
what else she does,

508
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,323
if a woman isn't a good mother,
she's a failure, right?

509
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:13,761
Look, um...

510
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:19,060
When I had Travers,
I knew I was in over my head,

511
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,570
and when Charles
and I split, I...

512
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:24,713
I gave him custody.

513
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:30,020
Because I wanted my son
to have the best life possible.

514
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,833
And that doesn't make me
a good mother, but...

515
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,172
I like to think it makes
me a realistic one.

516
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:44,730
Hey, Mom.

517
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:46,590
Hey, champ.

518
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:48,541
I missed you.

519
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,800
I missed you, too.

520
00:26:51,606 --> 00:26:52,580
Guess what?

521
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:55,711
I've got so many fun things
for you to do today.

522
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:57,061
Cool.

523
00:26:57,505 --> 00:26:58,562
Thanks for
the ice cream.

524
00:26:58,606 --> 00:26:59,591
My pleasure.

525
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,440
I'll see you, little man.

526
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:02,700
Hey.

527
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:06,832
Travers said he's
staying at least a month.

528
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:08,421
Yeah.

529
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,881
So if you ever need
a babysitter, just yell.

530
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:16,671
I appreciate that.

531
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,282
Hey! Wait for me!

532
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:25,502
No, I don't want
a viola player.

533
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,161
I asked for a violinist. I don't
even know what a viola is.

534
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,623
Oh, it's just
a big violin?

535
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:33,163
Okay. Yeah, sure.

536
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:34,733
Okay, I'll see you at 8:00.

537
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:37,180
What was that?

538
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:41,223
It's just a little
surprise, okay?

539
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,833
-Let it go.
-"Let it go", that's cute.

540
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:45,920
Start talkin'.

541
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:49,083
I planned a little something
for our anniversary.

542
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,032
That is all
I'm gonna say.

543
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,103
Okay. Okay. Okay.

544
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,973
If we're doing this,
I need to buy you something.

545
00:27:58,245 --> 00:27:59,962
What do you want? You don't
have to buy me anything.

546
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,551
Well, you didn't have
to plan anything,

547
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,670
but you did, even though
we had an agreement.

548
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,883
You like ties?
You're getting a tie.

549
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,602
What are you getting?

550
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:10,253
I have been dragging my ass
all day, and the only thought

551
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,583
that's kept me going
is the hot bath,

552
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:16,202
and now I have do my hair
and shave my legs.

553
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,601
So what do you
want to do, Lynette?

554
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,140
Just tell me what you want.

555
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:20,890
I told you what I want.

556
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:25,272
Hot bath, bed early,
but you choose not to listen.

557
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,783
Well, okay, I guess I can
just cancel the whole thing.

558
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,443
You can have your
dream evening alone,

559
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:32,532
and I'll get up a poker
game or something.

560
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:33,771
Thank you.

561
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,361
Hey. You know what? I've been
dragging my ass all day, too,

562
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,670
and you know what
got me through it?

563
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,180
The idea of doing
something special with you.

564
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,551
Happy anniversary.

565
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:55,340
All right. I'm off
to join your mother.

566
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:58,231
The hotel number's on the fridge
in case there's a problem.

567
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,991
Bree said her cell phone
isn't getting good reception.

568
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:04,313
Actually, we kinda
already have a problem.

569
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,963
Well, I'm already
late for my flight.

570
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:07,992
Can this wait a few
weeks till we're back?

571
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,102
Yeah, this could
wait a few weeks.

572
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:10,740
Oh, good.

573
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,990
I mean, heck, this particular
problem could wait...

574
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:14,622
nine months.

575
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,040
Good Lord.

576
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:23,332
How was your bath?

577
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:24,563
Oh, I couldn't relax.

578
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,293
I just kept replaying the fight
I had with Tom in my head.

579
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,661
Well, at least your husband
tries to be romantic.

580
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,700
Every anniversary, Gilbert
bought me an appliance.

581
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,892
The last one, he gave
me a vacuum cleaner.

582
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:38,052
He died two weeks lar.

583
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:39,780
I didn't cry.

584
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,303
Who could that be?

585
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:46,333
Here.

586
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:50,820
All right. Here's
what we're thinking.

587
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:54,910
Clearly, the idea of the two of
you getting married is ridiculous.

588
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:57,931
So what do you
want me to do?

589
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,262
Glad you asked.

590
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:02,062
Bree and I have decided

591
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,573
that Danielle will join
us on our heymoon.

592
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:08,631
When we return, we'll tell our friends
she's decided to study abroad.

593
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,581
Once the baby is born and
adopted by a suitable family,

594
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:12,901
she'll come home.

595
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,131
What about me?

596
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:18,433
You leave.

597
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:19,763
Leave?

598
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:22,013
Get out of Fairview
and don't tell a soul why,

599
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,261
-Not even your aunt.
-I can't do that.

600
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:25,033
Why not?

601
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:26,491
Because I've got
responsibilities here.

602
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:27,611
People are counting on me.

603
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:29,033
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that

604
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,693
before you impregnated
my stepdaughter.

605
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,120
I said I'm not leaving!

606
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,500
Easy there, turbo.

607
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:36,863
We'll be right back.

608
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,343
So who exactly
is counting on you?

609
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:47,750
Julie Mayer, maybe?

610
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:49,420
She gave me
another chance.

611
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:51,413
I can't leave if I've still
got a shot with her.

612
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,243
And what's gonna happen when Julie
finds out you knocked up my sister?

613
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,200
Didn't your stepdad just say no
one's gonna find out about that?

614
00:30:58,878 --> 00:30:59,481
Okay.

615
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:01,601
Try this.

616
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,720
Julie's a nice girl,

617
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,302
and you, well...

618
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,501
you're a dog.

619
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:13,860
No knock.

620
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,563
I'm a dog lover myself,

621
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:19,460
but Julie deserves better.

622
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:22,302
You know you'll just
end up cheating on her.

623
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,052
No, I won't
hurt her again.

624
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:27,012
Sure you will.

625
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,430
Not right away.

626
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,731
Maybe you'll hold
out for six months,

627
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,731
but then it'll hurt
her even more.

628
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:37,853
Am I wrong?

629
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:42,560
You just have
to ask yourself

630
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,032
if you can be the kind of
guy she needs you to be.

631
00:31:46,636 --> 00:31:47,482
If you can't...

632
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,120
walk away.

633
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:59,460
Beer is on the
house, guys.

634
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:02,860
Drink fast, get stupid,
lose money.

635
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,000
Mike!

636
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,121
Hey. How's it going, buddy?

637
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,760
Hey, you know,
uh, Orson, right?

638
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:09,820
Oh, yeah.

639
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:11,141
Hey, neighbor.

640
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,371
Hey, so let's get started, huh?
5-card stud? Two dollars ante?

641
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:16,970
Good evening, gentlemen.

642
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:17,980
Ian!

643
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,980
Hey... Ian.

644
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:22,753
Nice to see you, Mike.

645
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,070
What is fish and
chips doing here?

646
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,391
Susan asked me
to include him.

647
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:32,943
Said he always wanted
to learn how to play poker.

648
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:35,662
So we're going to give him
some very expensive lessons.

649
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,581
Be careful. He already
knows how to bluff.

650
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,133
Hey.

651
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:48,840
Hey. How's it going?

652
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:50,613
Good. Good, uh...

653
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,340
Just wanted to tell you, I have
to leave town for a while.

654
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,661
Really?
Is something wrong?

655
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:59,111
No, no, no.
It's just family stuff.

656
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,282
I don't know exactly
when I'll be back.

657
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:06,891
It could be a while,
though.

658
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:13,450
Okay.

659
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:15,553
I just want you
to know that...

660
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:18,943
It means a lot that you were willing
to give me a second chance.

661
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:23,462
You're, like, the only person
that's ever done that.

662
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,211
Austin...
What's going on?

663
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,441
Nothing, uh,
it's just...

664
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,083
I have to go.

665
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,082
Good-bye, Julie.

666
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:41,380
Austin!

667
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:05,433
I'll raise you.

668
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:10,603
Out.

669
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,851
Ah, another courageous
move for "foldilocks."

670
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:16,013
All right. I'll call you.

671
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:18,753
Flush, king high.

672
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:23,252
Full house,
7s and knaves.

673
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:26,453
Jacks.
We call them jacks.

674
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,230
Boy, this is your
lucky room.

675
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:31,443
Yes, I heard about your
engagement the other night.

676
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,520
Congratulations.

677
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:35,232
Yeah, about that, Ian,

678
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:39,510
Was that proposal spontaneous,
or did you have it all planned?

679
00:34:39,738 --> 00:34:41,122
It was entirely planned.

680
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,541
I thought it would be
the ideal occasion.

681
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,951
Well, if it was planned,
why didn't you have a ring?

682
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:49,851
Well, I thought Susan might
like to choose the ring herself.

683
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:51,521
Ante up, boys.

684
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:54,372
So why'd she pick a ring
that was too big for her?

685
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:58,000
How did you
know that?

686
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:01,201
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
we came here to play cards.

687
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,521
Why are we talking
about jewelry?

688
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:06,260
Sorry, Tom, but I just found out
I bought a ring for Susan myself.

689
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:10,050
It was in my pocket that night
some son of a bitch ran me over.

690
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,700
Hey, Tom's right.
We should focus on the game.

691
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,841
After our talk,
I called the hospital.

692
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:19,731
They said my ring got in
with your wife's stuff.

693
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:21,931
So you saw it
before I did...

694
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,882
The same day you
proposed to Susan.

695
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:28,161
And your point is?

696
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,192
That that's why you were
in such a big hurry.

697
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:34,611
You wanted to seal the deal before
I found out about the ring and told her.

698
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:38,032
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

699
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:39,542
Maybe you should be.

700
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:41,610
What do you think
Susan would say

701
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:44,761
if she found out why your
proposal was so spontaneous?

702
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,593
Guys, can we just play?

703
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:49,222
I'm trying.

704
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:51,722
Fine.

705
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:54,052
Deal.

706
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:03,880
Hello?

707
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:04,741
Mr. Scavo,

708
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,451
It's Lamar from
the limo service.

709
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:10,461
I got a flat, so I might be late
picking up you and your wife.

710
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,643
What are you talking about?
I canceled you.

711
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:13,731
No, you didn't.

712
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,761
Yes, I did. I left
you a message.

713
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,161
I must have
missed it.

714
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:19,931
Anyway, I dropped your wife off,
right where you told me.

715
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:21,843
Oh, God. When?

716
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,083
About two hours ago.

717
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,960
Guys, lock up
when you're done.

718
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:37,483
I'll open.

719
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:40,603
I'm out.

720
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:42,052
And I'll raise you.

721
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:48,561
You want a beer?

722
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,841
Hell, Tom's gone.
Let's go open up the good stuff.

723
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:56,433
Well...

724
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:58,540
Looks like
it's just you and me,

725
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,641
if you're still in.

726
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:04,051
With this hand?
You bet I am.

727
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,170
I'll re-raise.

728
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:16,923
And raise again.

729
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,612
Your stack's
looking kinda small.

730
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:33,042
Will you take a check?

731
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:35,973
You know I can't
match that.

732
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:38,801
How about this, then?

733
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:42,590
You win, you keep the money, and
you tell Susan whatever you want.

734
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:46,661
I win, you keep your
mouth shut about the ring,

735
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,691
and you leave me
and Susan alone.

736
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,983
Deal.

737
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:18,782
How was the game?

738
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:21,301
I won.

739
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:36,182
Lynette, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry!

740
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,281
You see, there was supposed to
be a horse-drawn carriage and...

741
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:43,913
Good. You got the flowers.

742
00:38:57,956 --> 00:38:58,541
Coffee?

743
00:38:58,865 --> 00:38:59,771
Yes, please.

744
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,662
Yeah, she likes
coffee, too. Thanks.

745
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,941
I'm really, really,
really sorry...

746
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:12,062
Please stop apologizing.

747
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,100
I appreciate what you
were trying to do.

748
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,770
It was a lovely though that
just went hideously, hideously,

749
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:18,403
hideously wrong.

750
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:23,233
Wait till the kids find out
that you saw a real coyote.

751
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,282
Hideously.

752
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,430
Well, I learned
my lesson.

753
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,792
Never again.
No more surprises.

754
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:35,062
From now on, I'll do
exactly what you say.

755
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:42,823
Don't... you... dare.

756
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:44,730
What?

757
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,680
I had a lot of time
to think tonight,

758
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:49,881
and I realized
you were right.

759
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,081
We have to keep
the romance going,

760
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:55,472
no matter how
tired we are.

761
00:39:56,905 --> 00:40:01,032
The only thing worse thaor just
going through the motions Is not...

762
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,951
bothering to go
through the motions.

763
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,130
So you want me to
surprise you next year?

764
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:10,690
Knock yourself out.

765
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:14,372
Just wait, 'cause I will think
of something even better.

766
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:16,211
Well, after this year,

767
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,752
I would be happy
with any date

768
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,980
that included
food and shelter.

769
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:34,913
Nine years.

770
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,093
Nine years...

771
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:44,653
And I have loved
every minute of it.

772
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,191
Me, too.

773
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:59,871
Take a drive down any
street in suburbia.

774
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:01,781
You know what
you're gonna see?

775
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,673
A bunch of guys wearing
the same expression.

776
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:09,763
It's a look that says,

777
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,662
"Oh, crap.

778
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,692
My dreams are never
gonna come true."

779
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:21,173
"I'll never have a life
free from scandal."

780
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:25,783
"I'll never have
a son of my own."

781
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,841
"I'll never hold her
in my arms again."

782
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:37,482
"I'll never get to
tell her how I feel."

783
00:41:41,945 --> 00:41:45,690
Yeah, the suburbs are filled with
a lot of men who have given up hope.

784
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,503
Of course, every once in a
while you do come across

785
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:53,911
some lucky S.O.B. whose
dreams have all come true.

786
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:57,723
You know how
you spot them?

787
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:01,961
They're the ones who
can't stop smiling.

788
00:42:04,548 --> 00:42:06,821
Don't you just
hate those guys?
