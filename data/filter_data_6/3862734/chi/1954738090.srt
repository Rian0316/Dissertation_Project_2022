1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:04,398
Leonard 你妈妈的飞机什么时候到?
Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,966
不知道... 大概是明天早上
I don't know... some time tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,868
你不查查确切吗?
Don't you want to know for sure?

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,371
没必要 只要她进入加州上空
No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace,

5
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:12,439
我就会感觉到原力受到干扰
I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,110
你们的妈妈都飞过来看你们领奖
It's so nice both of your moms are coming in

7
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:17,611
真是太棒了
to see you guys get an award.

8
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:21,015
最早是我赢了双胞胎姐姐 
Well, my mother's been there for every honor I've won

9
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,549
获得了"学会上厕所"桂冠
since I beat out my twin sister

10
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:24,485
之后每次领奖 妈妈肯定会到场
for the "did it on the potty" trophy.

11
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,454
看上去怎么样?
How does this look?

12
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:29,923
很漂亮 她肯定会喜欢的
Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.

13
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,191
嗯 送妈妈的就是玫瑰
Sure, his mom gets roses.

14
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:32,393
我想要的时候
When I want them,

15
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,329
那就是"一束盛放的植物生殖器"
they're a "bouquet of severed plant genitals."

16
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:37,765
别说得像是情人节
You act like I didn't get you

17
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,100
我没送过你那根蘑菇木桩
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.

18
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,468
他说得对
He's right.

19
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,139
玫瑰会枯死 但湿哒哒的烂木桩可以培养蘑菇
Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms

20
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:47,641
长达两到三年之久
for two or three magical years.

21
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,643
要知道 你妈妈对我俩在一起
You know, your mom's never been

22
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:50,911
一向不是太高兴
too thrilled with our relationship.

23
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:52,713
也许我该给她准备份礼物 缓解一下关系
Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.

24
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,415
如果你立刻跑出去弄个博士学位
If you could run out and get a PhD,

25
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,984
可能她就会喜欢你了
that might make her like you.

26
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:00,287
真的吗? 她好像也不喜欢你呀
Really? It didn't work for you.

27
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,789
你觉得两位妈妈会相处融洽吗?
Do you think the moms will get along?

28
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,490
我不知道 她们挺不一样的
Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.

29
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,359
也许她们会成为好朋友
Maybe they'll be best friends.

30
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:08,395
一个绝顶聪明 一个天真呆萌
One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple.

31
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,165
是不是听着很耳熟?
Sound familiar?

00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,726
谢谢你 妈妈
Oh, thank you, Mother.

45
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,761
我试着看了下你的论文 但发现
I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard

46
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:48,996
很难理解
for me to understand.

47
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,998
事实上非常简单易懂
Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,634
它阐述了一个新的宇宙模型
It describes a new model of the universe

49
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,969
概念上来说 可以看成是
that conceptualizes it as the surface

50
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,671
n维的超流体的表面
of an n-dimensional superfluid.

51
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:58,639
真有趣
Interesting.

52
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,040
这东西你相信
You can believe that,

53
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:04,311
但上帝让动物一对对上方舟 那就是胡扯
but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.

54
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:09,817
他们拿什么喂狮子 妈妈?
What did they feed the lions, Mother?

55
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,855
当然是淹死的罪人的浮尸
The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.

56
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:21,595
听着 Leonard的妈妈是位著名的精神病医生
Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist

57
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,197
以及女科学家
and woman of science.

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,899
她在场的时候 你能不能不要
Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself

59
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,367
圣经来圣经去的?
while she's here?

60
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,002
你觉得我丢你脸了吗?
Are you ashamed of me?

61
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:32,406
当然不是 我爱你
Of course not. I love you.

62
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:36,710
我只是觉得你的信仰和言行会让我难堪
I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.

63
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,216
我也爱你
Well, I love you, too.

64
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:45,519
我的可爱小狮子狗
My little bowl of lion chow.

65
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,091
你和Penny定了婚礼时间吗?
So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?

66
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,527
没有 我们想慢慢来
No, we're kind of taking it slow.

67
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,362
好吧
I see.

68
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,766
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

69
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,836
你和这个女人分分合合七年了
You've been on and off with this woman for seven years

70
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:04,371
订婚都已经一年了
and engaged for one year.

71
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:07,040
我肯定会猜想是不是出问题了
One has to wonder if there's a problem.

72
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,377
你们的性关系和谐吗?
Are you having satisfactory intercourse?

73
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,547
是的 妈妈
Yes, Mother.

74
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,119
看出来了 也就和谐而已
Only satisfactory. I see.

75
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,923
我改答案了
I change my answer.

76
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,558
性生活... 很棒 很火辣
It... it's amazing. It's hot.

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,295
我们如胶似漆 根本分不开
We can barely keep our hands off each other.

78
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,564
在你妈妈面前强调自己高超的性爱技术
Seems odd to try and impress your mother

79
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,934
真是太奇怪了
with your sexual prowess.

80
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:38,305
不过 你的恋母情结总是无法得以解决
But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.

81
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:40,307
听着 就是你刚刚那样
See, this right here, what you're doing,

82
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,943
你能别在Sheldon的妈妈耳边说这些话吗?
Can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?

83
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:46,480
为什么? 你也喜欢她么?
Why? Are you attracted to her, too?

84
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:47,881
当然没有
Of course not.

85
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:50,751
她只不过是一个信奉上帝的很贴心的一个人
She's... she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady,

86
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,186
你得尊重她的宗教信仰
and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.

87
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,488
Leonard 我是成年人了
Leonard, I'm an adult.

88
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,823
我知道如何在不同生活背景的人
I know how to conduct myself around people

89
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,659
面前表现自己
from different walks of life.

90
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,693
谢谢你
Thank you.

91
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:00,594
她是从哪里来的来着?
Where is she from again?

92
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,263
- 德州东部  - 天哪 
- East Texas.  - Ugh.

93
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,368
嗨 看看谁来了
Hey, look who's here.

94
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,406
啊 是Hofstadter博士啊 真高兴再次看到你
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.

95
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:13,540
我也是
Likewise.

96
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,009
我读过你的论文了 非常不错
I read your paper, it was very impressive.

97
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,110
是吗 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

98
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:19,112
我们刚才路上堵了两个小时车
We just spent two hours in traffic.

99
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:22,282
你有想过跟我说你喜欢我们的论文吗?
Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?

100
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:24,651
当然 但是母亲的职责就是
Of course I did, but it's a mother's job

101
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,321
确保她的孩子的自尊心不会依赖于
to make sure her child's self-esteem is not dependent

102
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:28,622
任何人的认可
on anyone's approval.

103
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,160
你真好 居然认为我还有自尊心
That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.

104
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:36,964
Hofstadter博士 这是我的母亲 Mary
Dr. Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.

105
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,298
很高兴见到你
So nice to meet you.

106
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,500
我也是 你的旅途怎么样?

107
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:41,935

00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:43,870
非常好 几乎像是

109
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,707
{\an8}上帝

110
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,707
飞机被"某个人"照看着
not saying who was watching over the plane.

111
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,078
你是开玩笑吧?
You're kidding, right?

112
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,549
你还真是婉转啊 妈 婉转
Subtle, mom, real subtle.

113
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,422
Sutart啊
Stuart.

早啊
Morning.

115
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,627
我们之前谈过了
We talked about this.

116
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,962
我不介意你继续住在这里
I don't mind you still living here

117
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,397
但是我们有家规啊
but we got to have some rules.

118
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,666
第一条就是必须穿裤子
And rule number one is pants.

119
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:17,471
早啊
Hey.

120

你一定很为你的儿子骄傲吧
You must be very proud of your son.

00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,044
那当然
Oh, yes.

122

他最近在最高法院上辩护了一个案子
He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.

123
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,852
真的吗?
He did?

124
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,622
哦 你是说这个儿子吗?
Oh, you mean this son?

125
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:39,126
当然 他这么棒
Uh, sure, he's terrific.

126
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,529
Beverly 你想不想看我推导出来的
Uh, Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out

127
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,097
证明我们的猜想的数学公式呢?
to support our hypothesis?

128
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,465
嗯 你是说我的猜想吗
Uh, you mean, my hypothesis.

129
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,167
它完全是由我自己提出来的
I hypothesized it all by myself.

130
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,469
别激动 孩子
Calm down, dear.

131
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,771
Mary 我很好奇
Mary, I'm curious.

132
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,938
你是什么时候注意到
When did you first realize

133
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,374
你的儿子有一个如此聪明的大脑呢?
that your son had such a remarkable mind?

134
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,309
哦 问的好
Ooh, good question.

135
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:59,312
每个人都喜欢听天才少年Sheldon Cooper的故事 
Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

136
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,883
我想 是从他13岁时
Well, I would have to say when he was 13

137
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:05,852
尝试在工具棚里建造核反应堆的那一刻开始的
and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.

138
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,854
哦 这个特别不错
Ooh, this is a good one.

139
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,391
你首先要了解 Shelly这孩子
Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is

140
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,692
自打他小时候
ever since he was a little boy

141
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:16,530
他一直关心别人的福祉
he was always concerned with the well-being of others.

142
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,101
他觉得交电费
And he didn't think that it was fair

143
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:23,070
是一件很不公平的事
for people to pay for electricity.

144
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,206
所以他想要给整个小镇的人提供免费的电力
So he was gonna power the entire town for free.

145
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,541
{\an8}放射性元素 可以被用做核反应堆燃料棒

146
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,541
给她讲那个铀的故事!
Tell her about the uranium!

147
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:28,975
给她讲那个关于铀的故事!
Tell her about the uranium.

148
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:30,644
哦 好吧
Oh, well.

这个故事很好玩
Oh, this is adorable.

150
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:35,282
{\an8}黄饼: 核反应燃料重铀酸胺或重铀酸钠的俗称

151
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:35,282
当他想从Chad(音同乍得 非洲国家)那里弄到黄饼时
When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad

152
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,684
我以为他是在谈论他从他的朋友那里
I thought he was talking about Twinkies

153
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,419
拿的Twinkies面包
from one of his friends.

154
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,419
{\an8}美国著名夹心面包 其公司现已破产

155
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:41,655
但其实我不是
But I wasn't.

156
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,491
因为我根本没朋友
'Cause I didn't have any friends.

157
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,393
不
No.

158
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,463
最后我才发现这个淘气包是在试着
It turns out that this little scallywag was trying

159
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,199
用我的Visa卡从一个
to use my Visa card to buy uranium

160
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:56,369
乍得的军阀那里买铀!
from an African warlord in the country of Chad!

161
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,507
听起来Sheldon很调皮啊
Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.

162
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,142
当然难啊
Oh, he was a handful.

163
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,045
我那时确实很调皮
I was a handful.

164
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,280
你现在还不是一样
You still are.

165
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:13,620
呃 妈 给Mary讲讲
Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story

166
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:16,323
{\an8}用来产生静电的装置

167
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:16,323
我用吸尘器做了个Van de Graaff起电机
about how I made a Van de Graaff generator

168
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,891
的那个故事
out of our vacuum cleaner.

169
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,092
好吧
All right.

170
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:21,928
他把吸尘器给弄坏了
He broke the vacuum cleaner.

171
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:30,804
有一阵子就是 吸血鬼吸血鬼吸血鬼
I mean, for a while, everything was vampires.

172
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,439
现在全是僵尸了
Now it's all zombies.

173
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,075
不知道下一次会流行什么样的怪物
I wonder what the next monster fad will be.

174
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,611
倒是很久没看到什么优质的隐形人了
We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.

175
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:40,580
看来 你们从来没见过我想搭讪女人的囧样
Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.

176
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,717
大哥们
Guys.

177
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,219
你们坐在这儿玩游戏的时候
In the time you've been sitting here playing video games,

178
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,288
我把车给洗了 顺手买了清洁用品
I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies

179
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,623
还去了银行
and went to the bank.

180
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,392
我把裤子穿上了
I put on pants.

181
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:54,594
马屁精
Kiss-ass.

182
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,599
好吧 不知道从什么时候开始我变成
Okay, I don't know when I became the mother

183
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:00,800
三个懒娃的老妈了
to three lazy teenagers,

184
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,035
但是就到今天为止了
but it stops today.

185
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,538
我命令你们几个去打扫厨房 要彻底清理
You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.

186
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,274
嘿 我又不住这儿
Hey, I don't even live here.

187
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,243
那你说 我洗衣机里有没有你衣服?
Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?

188
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:12,746
确实有
I do.

189
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,115
有些是羊毛的
And some of it's wool,

190
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,150
所以如果可能的话请把它们平铺晾干
so dry flat if possible.

191
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,821
哦 这是我拿到
Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving

192
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,590
本科学位时候的照片
my bachelor of science degree.

193
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:26,026
你看起来不是很开心的样子
You don't look very happy.

194
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:28,562
嗯 我刚开始青春期
Well, I had just begun puberty.

195
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,432
正是我这辈子里最容易发毛
It was figuratively and literally

196
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:35,001
也最容易长毛的时候
one of the hairiest moments of my life.

197
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:38,271
Shelly不喜欢改变
Shelly does not like change.

198
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:39,539
哦 是的
Oh, true.

199
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,608
但是 再怎么千辛万苦的打它
But all the clenching in the world will not keep

200
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,843
睾丸还是会奋力挤出腹部
testicles in your abdomen.

201
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,781
嘿 不好意思 工作上有点事情耽误了
Hey, sorry, got caught up at work.

202
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:48,715
嗨 Beverly!
Hi, Beverly!

203
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:49,983
你好
Hello.

204
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,952
哦 好吧
Oh, okay.

205
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,187
不好意思 我忘了
Sorry, I forgot.

206
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,689
你还记得我妈吧
You remember my mother.

207
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:56,623
哦 是的 嗨 Mary!
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

208
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,658
再见到你很高兴 亲爱的
Good to see you again, dear.

209
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,627
啊 对 这才对嘛
Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.

210
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,598
妈 我和Penny订婚之后你就没见过她了
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.

211
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,666
哦 是啊 给你看我的戒指
Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.

212
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:07,968
哦 挺可爱的
Oh, lovely.

213
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,836
一定很贵吧
Must have been very expensive.

214
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:10,971
哦 不 一点都不贵
Oh, no, not at all.

215
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,139
不 我们在网上找到一个
No, we, uh, found a place online

216
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,042
可以把金刚石钻头稍作修改的地方
that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.

217
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,513
不是 他说的不是真的
We did not. That's not true.

218
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:23,850
我能跟你单独谈一会儿么?
Can I speak to you alone for a second?

219
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,318
哦 可以
Oh, sure.

220
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,354
戒指是蒂凡尼的
It came from Tiffany's.

221
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:28,688
你是说盒子 是吗?
You mean the box, right?

222
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,023
快走!
Keep walking!

223
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:36,896
他在戒指上花了多少钱我真的不在意
Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring.

224
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,965
我觉得
I think.

225
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,468
戒指的事我说错了吗?
Did I misspeak about the ring?

226
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,436
是啊 这个我们待会儿说
Yes, and we'll get back to that.

227
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,272
但是 呃 在你妈都在这里的情况下
But, uh, even with your mother here,

228
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:49,109
你还是故意把我妈的注意力全都吸引过去了
you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom.

229
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,677
你就像那种
You're like one of those elephant seal pups

230
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,413
从两个妈妈那里偷吸母乳的小海象!
that steals the milk from two mothers!

231
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:55,715
你是指海洋生物学家
Do you mean what marine biologists

232
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,485
所说的那种"超级断奶"现象吗?
refer to as "super weaning"?

233
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:01,388
是 你是一个超级断奶娃!
Yes, you are a super weaner!

234
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,393
嗯 现在我不得不纠正你一下
Well, now I have to correct you.

235
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,329
作为多少懂一点海象知识的人
A-As a bit of an elephant seal buff,

236
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,864
我认为更精准的比方
the more accurate comparison

237
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,899
应该是两只母海象
would be when two mother seals

238
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,201
都积极地试图哺育同一只小海象
actively seek to nourish the same pup.

239
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:17,470
所以 我认为你想用的术语
So I believe the term you're looking for

240
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:21,274
应该是双母吸奶娃
is a double mother suckler.

241
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,476
是 你说对了
Yeah, you're right.

242
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:25,211
我要说的就是这个
That is the term I'm looking for.

243
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:28,682
你就是个卑鄙的双母吸奶娃!
You are a dirty double mother suckler!

244
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:33,520
终于把这个术语搞清了
Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out.

245
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,755
你哪来的胆子!
How dare you!

246
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,692
我们不着急
We're not in a rush.

247
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,560
到时候挑个好日子
We'll set a date when the time is right.

248
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:41,895
亲爱的 这不重要
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

249
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:43,563
男女结合之时
The moment a man lays with a woman,

250
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,732
上帝眼里 你们已是夫妻了
they are married in the eyes of the Lord.

251
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:47,200
我去
Uch.

252
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,598
"我去"?
"Uch"?

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,333
圣经在你看来就是一句"我去"?
The bible is "uch" to you?

254
00:10:58,335 --> 00:10:59,434
不好意思
No, I'm sorry.

255
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,769
我失礼了
That was inappropriate.

256
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:03,271
作为精神学专家
As a psychiatrist, I know how important

257
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,774
我深知迷信对人的重要性
people's superstitions can be to them.

258
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,245
你想说说迷信?
You want to talk about superstitions?

259
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,180
Sheldon给过我你写的书...
Sheldon sent me the books you wrote...

260
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,582
都是什么超我什么本能冲动的鬼话
all that nonsense about superegos and ids.

261
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:18,186
这是什么鬼人说的?
What bull dropped that on the barn floor?

262
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,089
他叫西格蒙德·弗洛伊德
His name is Sigmund Freud.

263
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,290
哇 看啊!
Hey, look at that!

264
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,694
你俩都相信大胡子犹太人
You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.

265
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,696
你一边待着
Stay out of this.

266
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,631
好的
Mm-hmm.

267
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,700
起码我相信的大胡子宣扬的是
At least the bearded man that I believe in

268
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,835
爱和慈悲
preaches love and compassion.

269
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:35,236
你那个说的都是
All yours talks about is

270
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,705
我们为什么把大便憋回去
why you hold in your poop

271
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:39,908
而且想爬回妈妈的肚子里
and want to crawl back inside your mama.

272
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,912
有意思
It's fascinating.

273
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,414
你这样的人怎么能生出
How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon

274
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,517
Sheldon这么聪明的孩子?
come from someone like you?

275
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,152
我知道为什么
I know the answer.

276
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:52,420
你可能不会喜欢的
You're not gonna like it.

277
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,856
说说看
Try me.

278
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,192
当时我怀着Shelly 去教堂的路上
When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church,

279
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,693
我向上帝祈祷
and I was praying to the Lord

280
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:02,697
赐我一个比他那傻爹聪明的孩子吧
to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.

281
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,935
接着就看见旁边一辆斯巴鲁里
And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

282
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:10,405
有个耶稣摇头娃娃在向我点头
in the Subaru next to me nodding yes.

283
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,014
这几个意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

284
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:23,218
我想说 真不敢相信我在跟你说这个
It means... I can't believe we're having this conversation.

285
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,452
那多做几次
Well, do it some more.

286
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,689
说不定能拍出点灵感
Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.

287
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:30,025
我们还是还是别自残了
Why don't we all stops hitting ourselves

288
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:31,693
说点和谐的话题 比如
and talk about something safe, you know,

289
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:36,064
鞋子啊或者可爱的中国小娃娃
like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.

290
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,632
你妈更喜欢我不喜欢你
It is not my fault that your mother likes me

291
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,501
- 那也不能赖我啊!  - 别给自己脸上贴金了!
- better than she likes you!  - Oh, don't flatter yourself!

292
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:42,737
她喜欢谁都比喜欢我多!
She likes everybody better than she likes me!

293
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,678
这果冻放多久了?
How old is this Jell-O?

294
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,949
其实这是胡萝卜 所以很久了
Well, it's carrots, so gonna say very.

295
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,286
抱歉 你们要做这些
Sorry we have to do this.

296
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:00,055
Bernadette说的也没错
Bernadette's not wrong.

297
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,856
她确实忙里忙外的
She does work hard around here.

298
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,091
也许她不再把你当孩子一样照顾
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

299
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,926
也是件好事
if she stops babying you so much.

300
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:06,995
她没把我当孩子
She doesn't baby me.

301
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,431
我上次看见她用平板车拉你回家
I saw her pull you home in a wagon.

302
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,800
澄清一下
For your information,

303
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:15,703
我是追一辆冰激凌车的时候扭了脚
I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.

304
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,273
承认吧哥们 Bernadette确实像你妈妈一样对你 
Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way

305
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,876
这样的夫妻关系可不健康
your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.

306
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,413
你说得对
You're right.

307
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:26,748
是时候了
It's time for me

308
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,985
我要在婚姻里表现得成熟一点
to act like an adult in this marriage.

309
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:35,323
担起一个丈夫的责任 把垃圾扔出去
Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash.

310
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,332
Bernie 我闯祸了!
Bernie, I made a mess!

311
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,438
真抱歉我让你妈生气了
I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.

312
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,107
没事 她会原谅你的
Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you.

313
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:55,410
不原谅是要下地狱的
She has to or she goes to hell.

314
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,714
我发现我的育儿策略
I can't help but notice

315
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:02,383
和你妈妈对你无条件的爱比起来
how her unconditional love for you

316
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:06,020
完全不一样啊
is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.

317
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:08,990
这种把感情作为奖励
Well, you doled out affection

318
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:11,793
施舍给孩子的方法...
as a reward for achievement...

319
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:14,095
被证实是养育孩子的良方
a proven way to raise a child.

320
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,731
也是训练小白鼠的良方
Or train a rat.

321
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,600
可是你看你现在多优秀啊
But look how well you turned out.

322
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:22,971
我好想假装谦虚一下 不过谁信啊?
I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me?

323
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,772
而且 您还应该想想
Still, you need to consider

324
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,509
Leonard的兄弟姐妹们都很成功啊
how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.

325
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,210
也是啊
I suppose.

326
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:33,348
可是我的兄弟姐妹是一群蠢货
While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.

327
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,351
如果 你成长在一个以奖励机制为基础的环境中
Do you suppose you would've flourished more

328
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,952
你会不会有更好的发展呢?
in a reward-based environment?

329
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:40,255
或许会吧
Perhaps.

330
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:43,158
可是不管我什么时候想吃切成段的热狗和意面 我妈都会给我做
But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs

331
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,161
所以 我也不在乎了
whenever I wanted, so who cares?

332
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:51,900
我做自己的时候 我妈从来不会对我表达出爱和关注
Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection

333
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:54,068
我必须得努力赢的她的爱
for just being myself; I always had to earn it.

334
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,036
哦 Leonard
Oh, Leonard,

335
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,472
她肯定也是很爱你的
I'm sure she loves you very much.

336
00:14:57,474 --> 00:15:01,109
只不过是用她的冷冰冰的背弃上帝的方法
In her own cold godless way.

337
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:04,979
是啊 而且你也不用通过努力得到我的爱
Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.

338
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,147
谢了
Thank you.

339
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,582
不过大概你给我买这个
Of course, you already knew that

340
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:11,319
公主方形切割钻头的时候就知道了
when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.

341
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,421
真的不是这么回事
That's not what it is.

342
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:15,490
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

343
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:20,261
等你妈妈回来 我会向她道歉
When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need

344
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:22,363
我不该那样对她说话的
to apologize for the way I spoke to her.

345
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,332
不用吧 是她挑起来的
Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.

346
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,202
这不重要 一名合格的基督徒总是体谅他人
Doesn't matter; a good Christian would've turned the other cheek.

347
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:28,303
不过
On the other hand,

348
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:31,306
一个合格的德州人早一枪崩了她 所以...
a good Texan would've shot her, so...

349
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,644
我只能折中一下了
I just kind of split the difference.

350
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,714
嘿 谁想吃意面和热狗?
Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?

351
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,082
- 我要吃!  - 我也要!
- Oh, me!  - Yeah, me, too!

352
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:43,084
马上就好啦
Coming up.

353
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:46,421
我觉得我根本不配吃这么好吃的
I don't really feel I deserve it.

354
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,925
刚才可真是一团乱
That was a big sticky mess,

355
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,627
但是... 我搞定了
but... I think I got it.

356
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:53,761
- 看起来不错  - 是啊
- Looks good.  - Yeah.

357
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,430
看啊
Look at that.

358
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,465
你自己清理干净了
You cleaned it up all by yourself.

359
00:15:57,467 --> 00:16:00,602
是啊 我自己收拾好了
Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.

360
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:02,637
说实话 我真不知道你为什么一直在抱怨...
Honestly, I don't know why you complain so...

361
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,907
好吧 我可能漏了这块地方
Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

362
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:14,415
你先出去
Just leave.

363
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,920
我很高兴我们能
I'm so glad that you and I were able

364
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,955
- 放下分歧握手言和  - 我也是
- to bury the hatchet.  - Me, too.

365
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,157
我尊重你有自己信仰的权利
And I respect your right to your beliefs.

366
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,693
我也会为你祈祷的
And I will pray for you.

367
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,831
好了老妈 趁现在没人吵架
Okay, Mom, let's get you back to your hotel

368
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,466
我赶紧送你回酒店吧
before anyone says anything else.

369
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,667
稍等一下
One moment.

370
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,536
我有话想跟你说
There's something I need to say to you.

371
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,072
真的? 完了完了
Oh, really? That's too bad.

372
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:41,843
Leonard 你一直要通过努力来得到我的爱和关注
Leonard, I always made you earn my affection,

373
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,177
不过今天我意识到
but today I realize

374
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,147
教育孩子的方法不止这一种
that there's more than one way to raise a child.

375
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,284
是我告诉她的!
I taught her that!

376
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:50,818
所以 我想
Therefore, I would like

377
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,622
开始以一种新的方法...
to initiate a new protocol wherein I...

378
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,925
无条件地爱你
shower you with unconditional love.

379
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,361
哇哦
Wow.

380
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,796
从什么时候开始?
When does that start?

381
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:04,966
还是这么粘人
So needy.

382
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:11,706
过来让妈妈抱抱
Come to Mommy.

383
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,976
没事的 快过去吧
It's okay, go ahead.

384
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:25,453
我的儿啊
Oh, my son.

385
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,457
我的妈啊
Oh, my mother.

386
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:31,793
我的上帝啊
Oh, my God.

387
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,237
# 生活如此艰难 #
# It's a hard-knock life #

388
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,742
# 我们的生活如此艰难 #
# It's the hard-knock life for us #

389
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:10,445
# 我们的生活如此艰难 #
# It's the hard-knock life for us #

390
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:13,148
# 无人真心相待 一直被欺骗 #
# 'Stead of treated, we get tricked #

391
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,718
# 无人亲吻我 还总被人踹 #
# 'Stead of kisses, we get kicked #

392
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,354
# 生活如此艰难 #
# It's the hard-knock life #
386 

393
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:22,391
# 满心痛苦 无人倾诉 #
# Got no folks to speak of so #

394
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,627
# 我们挥起锄头 面对生活的艰苦 #
# It's the hard-knock row we hoe #

395
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:28,437
# 没有羊毛毯 只有旧棉被  #
#  Cotton blankets, 'stead of wool #

396
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:31,472
# 从来吃不饱 顿顿饿得慌 #
# Empty bellies, 'stead of full #

397
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,340
# 生活如此艰难 #
# It's a hard-knock life. #
