1
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,732
Numero uno.

2
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:20,966
-You're on.
-Send him over to me in two minutes.

3
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:29,083
Although the joker could turn out
to be the ace in the pack.

4
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,849
Get in there, my son!

5
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,371
Can't win them all, Joe.

6
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:44,001
Problem?

7
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,045
That's my husband.

8
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,451
Thank you, chaps.

9
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,968
So?

10
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,810
The casino score's on hold.

11
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:49,770
We've got ourselves a new mark.

12
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,605
-Who?
-Jake Henry.

13
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,761
My husband.

14
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,242
He walked out on me five years ago...

15
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:58,205
with pretty much everything I owned.

16
00:01:58,293 --> 00:01:59,282
Everything?

17
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:03,889
Apart from a few thoughtful touches,
he took all the things that mattered to me.

18
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:05,884
-Even my home.
-Bastard.

19
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:09,330
He left me a Phil Collins CD
that wasn't even mine.

20
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:12,924
-Twisted bastard.
-The point is, it's payback time.

21
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,447
So what do we know?

22
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,649
-Ash?
-Well, I haven't had that much time.

23
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,850
But I have found out he's only in town
from Amsterdam for a few days...

24
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,447
to play poker. Texas hold 'em.

25
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,888
And he's got another game
at the casino tonight.

26
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:26,691
He playing for real or pulling a con?

27
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:30,402
-Probably the latter, knowing Jake.
-Well, it looked like it was for real.

28
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,245
And word is he's one of the best.

29
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,482
Is he, now?

30
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,689
-Where's he staying?
-The Aylesham.

31
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:38,692
So either he's worth a few quid
or he's planning not to pay.

32
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:39,808
What's our in?

33
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,407
We'll have to move fast,
so it'll have to be the poker.

34
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,132
Going on previous performances,
Danny can play our hopeless drunk...

35
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,283
-without too much difficulty.
-Yeah? Thank you.

36
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:50,285
I'll have you know it does take
a lot of hard work and dedication...

37
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:51,522
to be that convincing.

38
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:54,491
So we'll convince Jake to join us
in a holdem competition.

39
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:57,883
-Anything else we should know?
-lf someone's got something Jake wants...

40
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,850
he'll do whatever he can
to take it off them.

41
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,493
So we'll rekindle his desire for something.

42
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,689
In this case, Stacie.

43
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,083
You watch he don't get carried away.

44
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,050
Okay, same routine as last night.

45
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,567
Albert, you'll rope.
Stacie and I will wait for the signal.

46
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:16,202
Danny, as you were. Ash, dig around,
see what else you can find out.

47
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:18,761
Yeah, that's right.
You lot do the glamorous stuff...

48
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:21,686
and leave me to do the serious graft,
why don't you?

49
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,172
Let's get started.

50
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,371
Stace, can I have a word?

51
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,966
-Yeah.
-Look...

52
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,248
I understand if you don't want to do this...

53
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,369
but you know him better
than anybody else.

54
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,125
I just need a bit more going.

55
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,371
Twenty-nine! Big 29! Big 14!

56
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,162
Big nine! Come on, baby!

57
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,642
I saw you winning earlier.
You're quite a player.

58
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:58,722
Thanks.

59
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,771
Ben Morgan. Sometime poker player,
sometime blackjack player...

60
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:04,731
-sometime a winner.
-Jake Henry. All the time winner.

61
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,651
That I can believe, yes.

62
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,251
Benny the Ball, all right, son?

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,370
Hang on, just get our little drinky-poos.
Cheers, babe.

64
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,172
-I didn't catch your name, mate.
-I didn't give it out.

65
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,006
I've not seen you round here before,
have I?

66
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:23,642
Unlikely. I only arrived here yesterday.

67
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:28,528
This is Jake Henry. And he's an excellent
poker player and a very busy man.

68
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,613
-Having a good night, are you, Jake?
-I was.

69
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,685
Like I said, Mr. Henry is a very busy man.

70
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,765
All right, whatever.
Anyway, catch you later, Jack.

71
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,651
I'll see you later, Benny.
Tomorrow night, don't forget.

72
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,724
I know what you're like, Mr. Forgetful.

73
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,929
Nightmare. Don't tell him anything.

74
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,208
All right, sweetheart?

75
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,488
I wouldn't have thought you and he
moved in the same circles.

76
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,370
Oh, we don't. I know his father...

77
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:54,128
or rather, made his acquaintance
at a golf charity function.

78
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:58,851
He's a terrible bore, but a billionaire,
and therefore useful to know.

79
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,484
His son thinks he's one of the hotshots
on the poker circuit.

80
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:05,451
He's always trying to mingle
with the best players.

81
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:09,005
If the joker's dumb enough
to think he can beat the best players...

82
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,924
he deserves to lose every penny he's got.

83
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:14,369
Although the joker could turn out
to be the ace in the pack.

84
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,007
Richie Blake.

85
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,685
Richard to his father...

86
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,491
-Dick to anyone else.
-Hit me.

87
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:22,724
His dad has been funding
his son's gambling for years.

88
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,531
He's finally had enough.

89
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,331
He confided in me last week...

90
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:31,282
the next time he helps
his wastrel of a son will be the last.

91
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:36,650
Now, when Richie's bluffing, he's got a tell
that no one else seems to have spotted.

92
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:39,361
He does a little variation each time.

93
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,403
People think it's because he's drunk.

94
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,363
Are you wondering
why I'm telling you all this?

95
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,045
The thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

96
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,728
Well, I'm getting up a little competition
tomorrow evening, winner take all.

97
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:55,886
£25,000 sit-down money. I'll be the dealer.

98
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:58,449
Chip Lacey mentioned something about it.

99
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,728
Yeah, he's in, and Snake Eyes, too.

100
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:05,125
But, you see, I had to get them in,
otherwise Richie wouldn't be interested.

101
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,885
I could have done with more time...

102
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,090
but his father told me
it'll be the last drop he gives to Richie.

103
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:13,768
So I had to find a good player, and fast.

104
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,083
Stick your casino up your ass.

105
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,651
So, what are you saying?

106
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,525
I want to get you in the game.

107
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,081
I'll put in half of
the £25,000 sit-down money.

108
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,324
You put in the other half,
then give me 10% of your winnings...

109
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,450
and you get to keep everything else.

110
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,884
-What if I lose?
-Well, you won't.

111
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,850
A: because you're an exceptional player...

112
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,164
and B: because you've got a sure-fire tell...

113
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,172
courtesy of me.

114
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,292
Why not bring Snake Eyes or Lacey
in on this with you?

115
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:48,806
They're good...

116
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,851
but from what I saw this evening,
you're even better.

117
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,452
Nice plan, but no, thanks.

118
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,283
In case you change your mind.

119
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:04,522
Right?

120
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,527
I doubt it. I'm flying home to Holland
tomorrow. Thank you anyway, Ben.

121
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,847
Pleasure.

122
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,402
Stacie.

123
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,442
Jake.

124
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,811
What are you doing here?

125
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,369
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

126
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,807
-Are you alone, or are you with--
-No.

127
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,692
She's with me.

128
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,570
Well, well. Mickey Stone.

129
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:06,612
I heard you were dead.

130
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,331
Wishful thinking.

131
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:12,524
So what's the story, Mickey-boy?
You pulling casinos now?

132
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,763
No, I was here to play poker.

133
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,012
-I hope your game's improved.
-It has.

134
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,048
So how are things
in the small-con world, Jake?

135
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,725
Still taking £50 scores?

136
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,327
I wouldn't know. Some of us managed
to get out a long time ago.

137
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,052
And some of us got out with something
that didn't belong to them.

138
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,886
Leave it, Mickey. He's really not worth it.

139
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,328
Are you serious, after what he did to you?

140
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,644
I think I came out of it pretty well,
considering.

141
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,808
Albert, he's on the hook.

142
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,128
Good.

143
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,203
-He's gone for it.
-Nice one.

144
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,970
Come on, come on.

145
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,930
That is all double Dutch to me.

146
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,482
Come on, come.... We're in.

147
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,049
-Forgotten your key?
-Hello, Stacie.

148
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,731
Goodbye, Jake.

149
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,124
I've come to apologize.

150
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:58,206
-You're five years too late.
-Please.

151
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,286
I thought I'd keep you company...

152
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,012
seeing as though it looks like
Mickey's neglecting you.

153
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,766
-He'll be back soon.
-It won't take long.

154
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,452
Lovely view.

155
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,684
You've done well for yourself.

156
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,564
How long you had this place?

157
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,285
The show apartment, please.

158
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,372
Couple of years.

159
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,850
Nice to see at least my money went
on a decent suit.

160
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,641
Although I don't recall
the marriage vows saying:

161
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,564
''Love, honor...

162
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,206
''and do a runner
with your wife's savings.''

163
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,762
Okay. I deserved that.

164
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,607
And that.

165
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:01,929
So what's he been up to
in Amsterdam all this time?

166
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,244
Well, put it this way, he hasn't exactly
been tiptoeing through the tulips.

167
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,449
He made a mint
on the poker circuit out there...

168
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,410
and it looks like he's given up grifting.

169
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:11,370
Couldn't take the pace.

170
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:14,325
This is why I had to leave.

171
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:17,692
I owed Davey Canning
a lot of money in a poker game.

172
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,001
A lot of money.

173
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,685
This was a little taste of what was
to come if I didn't get him his money.

174
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,570
-Acid?
-I was lucky.

175
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,729
It was meant for my face.

176
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,242
I couldn't get all the cash together...

177
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:34,809
not even after selling the house.

178
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,292
I was desperate.

179
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,443
A phone call would have been nice.

180
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,451
-A postcard, even.
-I couldn't call you.

181
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,572
I couldn't get you involved in the mess.
Would have been dangerous for you.

182
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,171
I couldn't believe it,
seeing you in the casino tonight.

183
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:49,606
Must be fate, eh?

184
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,685
Or seriously bad karma.

185
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,891
You don't think
Stacie would fall for him again?

186
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,964
He once had quite a hold on her.

187
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,046
Once bitten....

188
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,725
Just because I couldn't call you...

189
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,407
didn't mean
that I stopped thinking about you.

190
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,292
Where's yours?

191
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,450
Bottom of the Thames.

192
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,288
Nice.

193
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,883
That where you wish I was right now?

194
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,608
I didn't know you could mind-read.

195
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,724
I don't blame you for hating me.

196
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,690
Aren't you going to get that?

197
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,406
It can wait.

198
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,329
-Twice bitten?
-No.

199
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:12,732
Not Stacie. I'm sure she's playing it fine.

200
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,808
I'm asking for a second chance.

201
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,765
Good to see
your jokes are as warped as ever.

202
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,524
I still love you, Stace.

203
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,526
Really warped.

204
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:29,892
I'm not joking.

205
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,243
We're good together, you know we are.

206
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,804
That was a long time ago.

207
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,565
Doesn't have to be.

208
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,643
I know Mickey's not right for you.

209
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:50,922
How?

210
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,252
Because....

211
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:13,290
You wouldn't have
kissed me like that if he was.

212
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,442
I think it was time you were going, Jake.

213
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,932
Any idea how much
Jake took Stacie for, Mick?

214
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,846
£25,000.

215
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,452
-So, do we have him?
-Looks like it.

216
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,527
You okay?

217
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,928
Or are you sick of being asked that
since Jake showed his face?

218
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:48,284
''Yes'' to both those questions.

219
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:53,723
I'm not sure if I'd have the bottle
to do what you're doing.

220
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:57,968
-How do you mean?
-Well, trying to take out a mark...

221
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,442
when the mark just happens to be your ex.

222
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,722
Things can get, you know, a bit messy.

223
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,965
Old feelings come to the surface,
all that, you know.

224
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:12,125
Except I don't have any feelings for Jake.

225
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,815
Good of you to fit me
into your busy schedule.

226
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,967
-Five minutes.
-Certainly, sir.

227
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:39,455
I haven't got long, Jake.
What do you want?

228
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,207
Done well for yourself, Mick.

229
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,209
Can't take all the credit.

230
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,856
Wouldn't have got where I am today
without Stacie.

231
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,894
Mind you, you haven't quite got
all the trappings, have you?

232
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:52,570
You and Stace still not hitched yet.

233
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:56,091
What's the story with that?
You got cold feet?

234
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:59,691
You haven't exactly made it easy for us
to find you, to get the divorce papers.

235
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,653
Perhaps Stacie doesn't want a divorce.

236
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:04,694
I must admit, she didn't sound so keen
on the idea of marrying you.

237
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,255
And how the hell would you know?

238
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,373
She didn't tell you
I was in your apartment last night?

239
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,614
I think you've outstayed your welcome.

240
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,254
You haven't heard my proposition yet.

241
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,689
Not sure I'm interested.

242
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,528
I think you might be.

243
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,889
-I'm gonna give you a second chance.
-Second chance at what?

244
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,490
There's a big poker game tonight.
Winner takes all.

245
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,214
A few other players involved.

246
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:31,414
I thought you might like another chance
at trying to beat me after all these years.

247
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:33,646
What makes you think I care?

248
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:38,173
Guy called Ben Morgan set it up.
He's gonna be the dealer.

249
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,292
£25,000 gets you a place at the table.

250
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:43,015
Why would I play in a game
with a dealer of your choice?

251
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,246
You think I'm gonna try and cheat you?

252
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:49,409
-Once a grifter, always a grifter.
-No, Mickey. I don't need to cheat you.

253
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,895
I use this.

254
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,087
You think you're smarter
than the next man...

255
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,610
that you can outplay him,
that you can outwit him...

256
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,493
but the truth of the matter is...

257
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,248
you're still a two-bit loser...

258
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:02,373
pulling cons on stupid marks
to get what you want.

259
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,288
-I'm out of that game.
-I didn't have to con Stacie.

260
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:08,731
True.

261
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,047
Then again, I wasn't around,
so there wasn't any competition.

262
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:15,731
And the competition's back now?
You flatter yourself, Jake.

263
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,930
You just can't handle
me being around Stacie.

264
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:24,012
No problem. You give me a call
when you get your bottle back.

265
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:29,890
If that's what it takes to get rid of you,
then yes, you count me in.

266
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,129
Ben Morgan.

267
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,085
Jake!

268
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,326
No, no! It's not too late, no.

269
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:50,371
Okay. Let's meet.

270
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,091
We're on.

271
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:56,330
Okay, holdem it is.
Are we all clear on the rules?

272
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,766
I hope you're paying attention.

273
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,535
Thank you.

274
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:11,606
At the start of the game,
every player gets two cards, face down.

275
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,095
Then comes the flop.

276
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,364
Burn one, place three up.

277
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,854
At each stage,
you place a bet to stay in the game.

278
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:37,535
Next, the turn card, or fourth street.

279
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:41,815
Then the river.

280
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,808
Now, the idea is:

281
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:50,247
between the cards you've got in your hand
and the cards on the table...

282
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,645
you make the best five-card poker hand.

283
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,049
Tricky thing is:

284
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:58,845
you've no idea of knowing
what two cards every other player has.

285
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:00,967
So you bet that you've got the best hand...

286
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:04,890
and once you bet, the other player
has to put in the same amount...

287
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,887
raise, or fold.

288
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:10,488
Of course,
if you think you've got the best hand....

289
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:15,530
All in.

290
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,524
Easy, tiger.

291
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,290
I've gone all in
because I believe he's bluffing.

292
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:24,051
He's got a nothing hand,
whereas I have pocket queens...

293
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:27,811
and with the queen in the flop,
that makes three of a kind.

294
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,653
He thinks I'm bluffing...

295
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,648
but listen, I can read this kid like a book.

296
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:37,731
Good thing is, I got pocket 10s.
Which is not bad at all.

297
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,367
I'm sure I've got him beat.

298
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:41,969
Now, if he loses....

299
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:47,009
Now, if he loses this, he's out,
'cause he's put all his chips in.

300
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:49,974
He ain't just lost the hand,
he's lost the whole goddamn game.

301
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,091
So I win.

302
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,371
You going to play the hand or not?

303
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:56,254
Touchy sod, isn't he? Right, I'll call.

304
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:04,092
-He's bluffing.
-He's bluffing.

305
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,569
Three queens...

306
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:14,735
beats a pair of 10s.

307
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,772
Here's the deal.
I'm gonna come in on this con with you.

308
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:30,815
Con? But isn't that rather ungentlemanly?

309
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:33,729
I'd like to think of it as an opportunity.

310
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,056
I've decided to use this ''opportunity''...

311
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:41,014
to bring someone else
into the competition tonight.

312
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,329
Mickey Stone.

313
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:45,528
And who is Mickey Stone?

314
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,925
Someone who's got something
that I want.

315
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,975
The more players in the game,
the more money in the pot.

316
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:53,809
-All the better for you and me.
-Exactly.

317
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,887
Which is why I'm only interested
if we make the pot bigger.

318
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,495
-How much?
-£50,000 sit-down.

319
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:03,370
£50,000?

320
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:07,967
I'll have to see if the other players
can come up with that in time.

321
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,371
Well?

322
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,373
-Yours and my stake, that's £100,000.
-Plus Ben Morgan's stake, £25,000.

323
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:20,696
We've already put
all our reserve capital into this.

324
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,927
-Not quite. There's my pension fund.
-No, Albie, don't even think about it.

325
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:28,089
This one was for you, remember? I mean,
you're worth every penny, my dear.

326
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:31,248
And there's the money I set aside
for June's hospital bills.

327
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:32,564
You can't do that, Ash.

328
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,295
I can if I think I'll get it back,
which I know we will.

329
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:36,729
Think of the returns, Stace.

330
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,091
Yeah, but if we lose,
we lose everything we've got.

331
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,814
We won't lose.

332
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,655
So, if Albert can convince
Snake Eyes and Chip Lacey...

333
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:46,808
to come up with an extra £25,000 each
for a place at the table....

334
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,615
-Already done.
-Then we need to find....

335
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:53,411
With what we've got so far,
we're still short by £20,000.

336
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,614
Three hours to find it.

337
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:02,808
I'm coming in to collect my boss' dog.
His wife brought her in this morning.

338
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:05,855
Yeah, that's her.

339
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:08,005
Mitzi.

340
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,246
I'll be around to collect her shortly.

341
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,965
Okay, yeah. I'll see you soon.
Thank you ever so much. Bye.

342
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:20,529
-This is going to be tight.
-I thought you liked a challenge.

343
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,084
Yeah, I do. I like Cameron Diaz as well.

344
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:26,532
Don't mean I stand a chance
of copping off with her, does it?

345
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:30,167
-Mind you, I don't know.
-Come on, beautiful.

346
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,370
Here you go.

347
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:50,970
All right, thanks a lot.

348
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,250
They're all divine.

349
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,804
Please take as long as you need to decide.

350
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,052
Perhaps you'd like to have a look at these.

351
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,208
Unfortunately, time is of the essence.
We do have a plane to catch.

352
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:57,968
I just can't make up my mind, darling.

353
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,171
Pumpkin, you have 30 seconds.

354
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:01,406
We have to go to Harrods
and get the playpen and the crib.

355
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:03,134
I'll have this one.

356
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:05,855
Or this one?

357
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:09,133
Okay, that's it. Come on. We have to go.

358
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:11,808
-Come on, I'm sorry.
-Sweetie?

359
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,887
You've been most helpful,
thank you very much.

360
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:16,729
-Look, I'll be two minutes.
-No, I said 30 seconds.

361
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:20,809
-You can't hurry a decision like that.
-Yeah, well, maybe we'll come back.

362
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,015
I promise, darling.

363
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:43,086
-I'll decide this time.
-Okay.

364
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,051
Come on,
you said you'd made up your mind.

365
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,445
Perhaps madam would like to try one on?

366
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,174
I knew you should have been
taking it easy.

367
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:58,291
No. I'm fine.

368
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:02,164
-Mitzi. Be careful with her.
-All right, Mitzi, all right, baby.

369
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:04,451
-Sorry.
-Stay.

370
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:08,405
-How you feeling?
-I'm fine, I just need some air.

371
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,929
Okay, then you can wait in the car.

372
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,405
-Here we go. Come on.
-But my....

373
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,131
It's been a heavy day.

374
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,615
-Mitzi!
-I'll take care of the dog.

375
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:19,052
Would you mind just escorting her
to the car? Thank you.

376
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:21,446
I am so sorry to have wasted your time.

377
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,731
Maybe we'll try to come back
when we're next in London.

378
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,408
If it helps...

379
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:28,613
I believe your wife was about to opt
for this one.

380
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,249
You think?

381
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:36,254
Could be a very expensive mistake
if you're wrong.

382
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,725
Tell you what, why don't I go and ask her?

383
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:41,171
Shouldn't take a second. Yeah?

384
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,495
Of course, sir.

385
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,168
I'll be a second.

386
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:16,054
-Told you we'd do it.
-Okay, game on.

387
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,335
Stage one:

388
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:22,045
we need to take the other two players
out of the competition first.

389
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,455
They won't want to leave the table.

390
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,130
If they leave before the game is over,
they forfeit their chips...

391
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:27,365
so they'll need a push.

392
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,526
Danny, you're taking care of Snake Eyes?

393
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,084
Yeah, me and Eddie
got a little something sorted.

394
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,929
Let's just say his mind will be
on more pressing matters.

395
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:36,654
Okay. Ash, Chip Lacey?

396
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,853
Yeah, everything's in place.
He's in for a small surprise.

397
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:43,770
Good. Then we move on to stage two:
the false tell.

398
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,369
What is the tell?

399
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,969
-Oh, God!
-Please tell me he's not serious.

400
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,648
Nothing to do with me.

401
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:53,455
I thought it was bordering on genius,
myself.

402
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,811
Well, think of something else, genius.

403
00:28:56,176 --> 00:29:00,328
All right, it'll be something, I don't know,
a little bit, you know, twitchy.

404
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:02,852
Okay, I suppose that's a bit more like it.

405
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:06,975
We let Jake win on a few of Danny's tells,
so he'll know he can trust me.

406
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,045
Good.

407
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:10,696
Once Danny's let Jake beat him,
he'll be out of the game...

408
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:12,255
and it'll just be Jake and me.

409
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,896
At which point, we'll play our joker.
Stacie?

410
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:19,975
I think that I should pay Jake
one more visit before the game.

411
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:23,408
Is that really necessary?

412
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:25,530
I think so.

413
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,965
Well, you've already reeled him in.

414
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:31,924
We're gambling everything we've got
on this. I need to be sure.

415
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:35,729
Excuse me.

416
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,333
Ja. Hello.

417
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:05,845
Yes!

418
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,728
I can't believe I'm doing this
for £3 an hour.

419
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:18,292
All you got to remember, yeah,
is you ain't seen me or any of us before.

420
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,485
-Got it?
-Got it.

421
00:30:19,576 --> 00:30:22,170
So tonight this is just a regular bar.

422
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:23,411
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

423
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,532
You ain't seen me, right?

424
00:30:25,696 --> 00:30:27,254
-Right.
-Good lad.

425
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:34,206
Ed, did I leave my pen here
the other night?

426
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,207
It's a gold one. Very expensive.

427
00:30:36,296 --> 00:30:38,446
I shouldn't think so.
I've never seen you in here before.

428
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,811
-No, really, I think I left it.
-Nope. Never seen you.

429
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,285
No, Ed, stop pissing about now, yeah?

430
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,525
Sorry, lad.

431
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:49,613
Does Mickey know you're here?

432
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,045
No.

433
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,532
Has he told you about the poker game?

434
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:55,605
Yeah.

435
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:58,527
I'm gonna beat him, you know.

436
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,685
-Why so sure?
-I bother him.

437
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:04,325
Why do you think
he's taking the game on?

438
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,932
I get to him, always have done.

439
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,685
Mickey's always gonna be second best...

440
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:14,092
especially where you're concerned.

441
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:16,767
Why are you doing this, Jake?

442
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:20,375
I want you back.

443
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,485
That's not gonna happen.

444
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,488
I know every inch of you, Stace.

445
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:30,374
I know the way you smell.
I know the way you think.

446
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:34,449
And I know the way you put your hands
through your hair when you're lying.

447
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,805
There's no way Mickey's gonna beat me.

448
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,171
I know every con, every move.

449
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:43,926
Whatever he comes up with,
I'm gonna beat him, and you know that.

450
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:45,370
Don't you?

451
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:49,613
Well, then call it off.

452
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,171
Why?

453
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,527
Because I don't want him hurt.

454
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:00,330
Too late.

455
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:03,046
Please, Jake. I mean it.

456
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:07,053
-Call it off.
-That's why you've come here, isn't it?

457
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,808
To save lover-boy.

458
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:15,055
-He was there for me when you left.
-I bet he couldn't believe his luck.

459
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:24,688
What you said,
when you said you still love me.

460
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:30,650
-Did you mean it?
-Yeah.

461
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:34,575
On my life.

462
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:45,495
-Does that make a difference?
-No.

463
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,488
Not even a maybe?

464
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:52,894
Not even a maybe.

465
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:20,045
-Here's my £25,000.
-£25,000 from me.

466
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:25,046
-Do you wanna buy in, lads?
-Game on.

467
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,610
There you go.

468
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,850
-Nearly had to stand down.
-How come?

469
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:39,496
My wife's going crazy,
me coming out playing cards...

470
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:41,567
two weeks before the baby's due.

471
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,370
I'm on call, 24/7.

472
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:53,689
That's Mickey.

473
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:57,493
Relax, Ben, you make it obvious.

474
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm sorry.

475
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:02,612
-Evening, sir. What can I get you?
-Just an orange juice for me, please, and--

476
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:06,132
I've ordered you a Kir Royale, Stace,
just for old times' sake.

477
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,653
Ben, this is Mickey Stone
and the lovely Stacie.

478
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,926
-Stacie.
-Stacie and I go back a long way.

479
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:19,691
-Really?
-Yeah. Still, that was a long time ago.

480
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,132
A lot's changed since then,
including Stacie.

481
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:26,052
I used to love you in that color.

482
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:30,484
You stacked?

483
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,688
This is Chip Lacey.

484
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:35,805
Hi, Chip.

485
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:38,410
And the guy in the specs there:
Snake Eyes.

486
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:39,645
Snake Eyes.

487
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,608
-Did you pack your bags yourself, sir?
-Absolutely.

488
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,126
It doesn't look like
your friend is going to turn up.

489
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:06,615
Why don't we just start without him?

490
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:09,972
Don't worry, he'll be here.
He's just a little tardy.

491
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,287
Why don't I keep the change?

492
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,095
I could have swum here
bloody quicker than that!

493
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:18,568
Bit late. Sorry, lads.

494
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,408
Interesting euphemism for ''drunk.''

495
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,452
-Decent of you to turn up.
-Oh, I've managed.

496
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:25,528
You know what they say, lads.
No show without Punch, is there?

497
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:27,925
Anyway, it took me bleeding ages
to find this place.

498
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,325
Hello, love.
I didn't realize there was ladies present.

499
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,644
You all right, sweetheart?

500
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,328
Cor, that's cute, isn't it?

501
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:36,249
So, what kind of a poxy old joint is this,
then?

502
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,611
I'm the owner of this poxy joint.

503
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:43,571
Right. Listen up, squire, I want
a large Scotch, nice and big, bit of ice.

504
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:46,045
Stick it on a tab, get one yourself.

505
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:48,214
All right, Jim?

506
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:49,925
It's Jake.

507
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,847
Yeah, whatever. Tell you what, lads.

508
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,689
Hope you got your lucky boots on,
'cause I'm feeling lucky tonight.

509
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,607
Are you feeling lucky tonight? Yes, I am !

510
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,814
All right, name of the game is
Texas hold 'em. Winner takes all.

511
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,974
Leave the table or you lose your stake,
you're out of the game.

512
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,854
Only after each player is out
will I call a break.

513
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,650
-Clear?
-Crystal clear.

514
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,374
Ready, gentlemen?

515
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:16,695
Raise you.

516
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,053
-Fold.
-All right.

517
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:22,131
Call.

518
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:26,053
Calling, are we?
Start as you mean to go on.

519
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:36,095
I'll raise £1,000.

520
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,015
You know what they say.

521
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,691
You gotta make action to get action.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

522
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:43,125
Fold.

523
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,647
All right, Ray Charles is out.

524
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:47,771
Fold.

525
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:51,291
Call.

526
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,531
A pair.

527
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,052
Three of a kind wins the game.

528
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,364
Mr. Lucky.

529
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:31,125
Flush.

530
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:34,372
Now would be a good time for coffee.

531
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:37,175
Yeah, and I'll have another large Scotch.

532
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:55,934
Come on, Benny,
deal me something lucky, son.

533
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:01,447
Think I'll have another one.

534
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,255
Thanks, cowboy.

535
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:19,965
Shit.

536
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:23,573
Take your glasses off,
you might be able to see better.

537
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:25,645
£600.

538
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,295
Snake Eyes to bet.

539
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,651
-Call.
-All right.

540
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,087
It's a pair. Wow, good deal.

541
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,209
To my left.

542
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:02,210
£1,000.

543
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,329
To the Mick.

544
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:06,571
Call.

545
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:11,649
Oh, well, that's something.

546
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:12,964
Raise £14,000.

547
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:15,809
£14,000?
That's a lot of money, ain't it, Snakey?

548
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:20,489
-You all right, mate? You look a bit--
-I'm fine.

549
00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:23,925
Call.

550
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:26,247
Yeah, I'll have a bit of that.

551
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,813
Thanks, mate, keep the change.

552
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,009
Black jack.

553
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:51,490
All in.

554
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:54,374
We have lift-off.

555
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,611
Call.

556
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:02,170
Ace high.

557
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:04,768
You must be joking.

558
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,009
-You went all in on that?
-Flush takes it.

559
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,213
Sorry, Snake, you're out of the game.

560
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:11,775
Don't I know it.

561
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,450
Well, he seemed in a hurry to leave us.

562
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,811
Two-minute break before the next hand.

563
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,014
Come on, come on.

564
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:23,535
Yeah, Ed, it's me.

565
00:40:23,616 --> 00:40:25,607
What are they up to? Is it time?

566
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:28,215
Okay, I'm on it.

567
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,569
-Leave it alone.
-Sorry, I gotta take it.

568
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,165
Hello?

569
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,011
Who is this?

570
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:41,850
She's not far off now, Mr. Lacey.
I think you'd better get over here.

571
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:46,049
-She's asking for you, yes.
-Yeah, all right.

572
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:49,132
Shit, shit.

573
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:50,331
Fold.

574
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,171
Fold.

575
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,734
All in. £20,000.

576
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,287
You're out of the game.

577
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:05,650
Break.

578
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:10,414
Glass of water, please.

579
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,406
Do you think Mickey suspects anything?

580
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:24,730
-Such as?
-Between us.

581
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:27,928
There is no ''us.''

582
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,255
Isn't there?

583
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:35,647
Do you know what I wish, Jake?

584
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:36,885
What?

585
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:40,645
That you'd never shown up at all.

586
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:43,934
I'd almost managed to forget about you,
and yet here you are...

587
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,007
messing up my life again.

588
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,612
How exactly am I messing it up?

589
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,166
Because you've got me so confused.

590
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,329
About what?

591
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:05,130
Mickey.

592
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,327
They're trying to con you.

593
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:19,446
That's why I came
to your hotel room earlier.

594
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,652
To try to get you to stop playing.

595
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:27,291
They all know each other,
apart from the two who are already out.

596
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:32,134
Richie's gonna give you a false tell,
then they'll wait till you've gone all in.

597
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,093
Richie will have a better hand than you...

598
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,770
but you're supposed to think
it's a poor hand.

599
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:40,891
The ''sure-fire tell''
isn't so sure-fire after all.

600
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:48,485
So, once Richie's out,
I'll stand behind Mickey...

601
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:51,608
and indicate to you
what cards he's got in his hand.

602
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,085
Why exactly are you telling me this?

603
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,454
Because I believed you
when you said you loved me.

604
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,091
I do.

605
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:10,645
Don't tell me.
You're catching up on old times?

606
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:12,249
Something like that.

607
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:15,569
Jake, give it up.

608
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,011
Sorry?

609
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:21,084
Trying to take what doesn't belong to you.
You're wasting your time.

610
00:43:42,216 --> 00:43:43,444
£30,000.

611
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:55,612
-I think you're bluffing.
-Call me, then.

612
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:57,175
I'll call you.

613
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:01,085
Give it to me, boy. Oh, yeah.

614
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:10,175
I'll go all in.

615
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:13,651
Call.

616
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:22,046
-Suck on them.
-Three sixes.

617
00:44:27,656 --> 00:44:29,135
Straight flush.

618
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:31,089
It's a fix.

619
00:44:31,496 --> 00:44:33,134
You're out, Richie.

620
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:36,405
I've never seen
anybody get a straight flush.

621
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:38,726
Get him a champagne, please. On me.

622
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:42,132
Benny, you're a bottom-card dealer
and a bum.

623
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,050
I'm not playing any of you amateurs.

624
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:48,487
Just you and me, Mickey.
You feeling lucky?

625
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:51,653
Jake, I don't rely on luck.

626
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:54,727
Two-minute break, gentlemen.

627
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,128
Time, gentlemen.

628
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:11,135
Just like old times.

629
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:13,767
You're really feeling that confident, Jake?

630
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,290
Only when I'm playing someone
who thinks he's better than me.

631
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:19,015
I think you're the one
who's about to go down.

632
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:21,686
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

633
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:24,370
Well, you know what? So am I.

634
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:27,575
Stace, that thing we talked about.

635
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:31,364
Forget it. I don't need any help.

636
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:34,525
I feel like playing this thing for real.

637
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:42,051
What?

638
00:45:42,136 --> 00:45:44,525
Go and take a seat at the end of the bar.

639
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:52,045
Go on.

640
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:59,049
If there's any suggestion of impropriety,
I'll call the game off.

641
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,727
No, you will not.

642
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,015
Deal the cards.

643
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:18,889
Come on, deal!

644
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,330
£10,000.

645
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:37,810
Call.

646
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:50,890
£15,000.

647
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:56,971
Call.

648
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:16,564
£40,000.

649
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,251
Call.

650
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:34,170
Red lady.

651
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:41,656
Painted yourself in a bit of a corner there,
haven't you, Mickey?

652
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:43,169
You think so?

653
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:45,009
I know so.

654
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:48,734
I'll tell you what.

655
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:53,812
Why don't you go all in and I'll call?

656
00:47:58,936 --> 00:48:00,369
Yeah, all in.

657
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:06,891
Call.

658
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,650
Straight.

659
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:17,492
Nine, ten, jack, queen...

660
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:19,811
king.

661
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:33,088
It's a straight.

662
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:36,933
A ten, a jack, a queen...

663
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:39,250
a king...

664
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:42,535
and an ace.

665
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,294
Bad luck, Mickey.

666
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:50,645
Ben?

667
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:02,334
-Thank you, Ben.
-Anytime.

668
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:08,369
Michael, if you're ever in Holland,
do call me.

669
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:10,606
I'll teach you how to play properly.

670
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:13,130
You coming?

671
00:49:20,936 --> 00:49:22,164
Stacie?

672
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:24,808
What's going on?

673
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:28,975
I just think that this is for the best.

674
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,446
Please try to understand.

675
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:34,687
It's my second chance.

676
00:49:36,816 --> 00:49:40,365
I don't know what to say. I still love him.

677
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:43,452
And let's face it, Mickey...

678
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:47,488
you never really wanted me, did you?

679
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:52,365
And Jake does.

680
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:56,495
This is a wind-up, right?
I mean, it has to be.

681
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,134
-Let's go.
-Stacie?

682
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:00,776
I'm sorry, Danny, Albie.

683
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:03,968
I will make sure
you get your money back, I swear.

684
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:06,366
Eddie, can I have my coat, please?

685
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:21,736
I can't believe it.

686
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:24,250
Is that it?
Stacie's gone, and so is the money?

687
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:26,292
Mickey, this can't be happening.

688
00:50:27,296 --> 00:50:29,287
Heathrow, mate, as quick as you can.

689
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,892
Shouldn't we pick up
some of my stuff first?

690
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:37,126
And let Mickey catch up to us?

691
00:50:48,616 --> 00:50:49,890
No, Jake!

692
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:56,326
I swear I didn't know.
I didn't know they were going to do that.

693
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,771
Change of plan.

694
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:07,728
I think that belongs to me.

695
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:10,654
Nice try, Mickey.

696
00:51:11,496 --> 00:51:12,770
Mickey...

697
00:51:14,056 --> 00:51:15,614
give it to him.

698
00:51:21,856 --> 00:51:23,812
I can't believe you're doing this.

699
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:27,172
Stacie, whatever he's promised you,
don't fall for it.

700
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:36,134
Stacie, I'm asking you, I am begging you...

701
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:38,373
please do not do this.

702
00:51:38,816 --> 00:51:41,376
What the hell are we going to do
without you?

703
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:44,129
I'm sorry.

704
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:50,256
Not the only thing I won off you again,
is it?

705
00:52:03,776 --> 00:52:05,209
You ''won'' me?

706
00:52:07,616 --> 00:52:10,528
Makes it sound like
I'm a prize in some raffle.

707
00:52:10,856 --> 00:52:12,972
Yeah, but you'd be the first prize.

708
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:18,572
-Thanks.
-It's a joke. Does it matter?

709
00:52:19,976 --> 00:52:22,171
The main thing is
that we're back together again.

710
00:52:22,256 --> 00:52:24,053
It matters to me.

711
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:26,374
Is that how you see me, Jake?

712
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:29,653
As a trophy you can show off
to your friends when it suits you?

713
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:30,725
Come on, Stace.

714
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:32,807
That's what this has all been about,
hasn't it?

715
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,693
-What?
-Money, winning...

716
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,687
getting one over on Mickey.

717
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:38,846
You're both as bad as each other.

718
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,894
It wasn't about wanting me back at all,
was it?

719
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:43,495
Of course it was.

720
00:52:43,616 --> 00:52:46,335
I mean, really wanting me.

721
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:49,414
Of course it was.

722
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:54,930
Prove it.

723
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:59,409
-How?
-lf I mean so much to you...

724
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:01,567
get rid of the money.

725
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:06,055
Go on. If you love me,
throw it out into the river.

726
00:53:06,536 --> 00:53:07,730
What?

727
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:14,687
I didn't think you would.

728
00:53:21,856 --> 00:53:23,175
All right.

729
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:09,495
Satisfied?

730
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,686
There was a moment there...

731
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:18,214
when I thought that you were genuine.

732
00:54:20,136 --> 00:54:21,967
And if you had been...

733
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:26,328
who knows what might have happened
between us?

734
00:54:27,856 --> 00:54:30,654
I was stupid enough
to think that you'd changed...

735
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:33,808
but you will never, ever change.

736
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:40,574
That was the case full of fake money,
wasn't it?

737
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:49,535
Goodbye, Jake.

738
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:06,050
-At least let me give you what I owe you.
-I don't give a damn about the money.

739
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,694
I never did.

740
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:10,568
Just get out.

741
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:46,374
My coat, please, Eddie.

742
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:07,172
Danny, does her taking one of these
mean anything to you?

743
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:08,935
Hang on a second.

744
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:13,134
I know what she's doing.

745
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,129
No, Jake!

746
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:26,446
I swear I didn't know.
I didn't know they were going to do that.

747
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:28,884
Change of plan.

748
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,005
Good to have you back, my dear.

749
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:51,249
You always could think
on your feet, Stace.

750
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:53,606
Stacie knew what she was doing.

751
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:56,695
-I never doubted her.
-Glad to hear it.

752
00:56:57,816 --> 00:56:59,727
Shouldn't we wait for the kid?

753
00:57:00,056 --> 00:57:02,206
Yeah, better had. He'll only sulk.

754
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:07,334
Yeah, he might be a little while.
He's gone fishing.

755
00:57:09,056 --> 00:57:12,605
-On his way up.
-Here we go.

756
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:17,212
So, what exactly have you been up to?

757
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:20,971
Let's just say I've been dotting the ''I's''
and crossing the ''T's,'' that's all.

758
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:22,330
Ash?

759
00:57:24,056 --> 00:57:26,331
I understand if you don't want to do this...

760
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,532
but you know him better
than anybody else.

761
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:29,810
Go on.

762
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:33,566
First, what were these
thoughtful touches that Jake left you?

763
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:36,250
Well, after selling the house...

764
00:57:36,736 --> 00:57:39,250
and cleaning out the bank account...

765
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:46,252
all he left me was a cactus...

766
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:49,807
a Phil Collins CD...

767
00:57:53,456 --> 00:57:56,050
and a moldy piece of cheese.

768
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,812
You did all that for me?

769
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:06,614
Yeah, well, it's not like
he didn't deserve it, is it?

770
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:10,334
-To absent friends?
-Why not?

771
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:12,289
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

772
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,924
Very funny. Who nicked me clothes?

773
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:27,333
Poor Danny!

774
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:30,845
Did you have to walk
past the receptionist like that?

775
00:58:30,936 --> 00:58:32,289
Yes, I did.

776
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:34,926
I did get her phone number, though.

777
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:38,890
-Well done, all.
-Well done, boys.

778
00:58:44,176 --> 00:58:45,370
Open it up.

779
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:48,049
Hello!

780
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:26,004
English
