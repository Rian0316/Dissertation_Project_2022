I'm gonna give you some homework
to help you move forwards.

515
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,880
[chuckles] Okay.

516
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Aimee!

517
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,280
Hey! I'm going to the gym.
Do you want to come to mine later?

518
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,040
Oh! I can't tonight.
I'm hanging with Maeve.

519
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
Yeah, I'm sorry to steal her, Steve.

520
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,080
Okay. Maybe tomorrow?

521
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Mm, yeah. Ooh, oh, tomorrow!

522
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,840
What was that about? I'm seeing
Elsie's new foster family tonight.

523
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,200
I know, I know, but he keeps trying
to kiss and cuddle me.

524
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,000
He doesn't mean to put pressure on me,

525
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,680
but sometimes he gets this hungry look
in his eyes, and I just wanna scream,

526
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,880
[shouts]
"No, Steve, I don't wanna have sex!"

527
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
[laughter]

528
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,040
I used to really like sex,

529
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
and I still wank a lot when I'm on my own,
but I don't know.

530
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,120
I just feel safer when I'm by myself.

531
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
How long has this been going on for?

532
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
Since the bus.

533
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,280
You might need to talk
to someone professional, Aimes.

534
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,160
Do you think I can find someone
like Otis's mum? She seemed nice.

535
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Yeah.

536
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,760
[Maeve] Hi, Otis.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

537
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
[clears throat]
Ruby picked this out for me.

538
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,840
I didn't ask, but cool.

539
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,640
We're still casual,
but I wanted to try something new.

540
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,080
Casual doesn't seem like you.

541
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Anyway, Aimee is still struggling
after last term, and I'm…

542
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,160
I'm worried about her.
She needs to talk to someone.

543
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,120
I wondered maybe
if she could talk to your mum?

544
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
- Sorry if it's weird to ask.
- No!

545
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
No, Maeve, of course.

546
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,760
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll… I'll chat to her.

547
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Thanks.

548
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,120
What did you mean,
"Casual doesn't seem like me"?

549
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,360
I don't know,
just the whole no-feelings thing.

550
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,000
You used to care a lot.

551
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Things are easier when you don't care.

552
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Nobody gets hurt.

553
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
Yeah.

554
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,120
Anyway, thanks, Otis. Gotta go.

555
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,720
[car horn blares]

556
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,440
We're going to hang at yours.

557
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
[whimsical music playing]

558
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,400
[brakes squeal]

559
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,320
[gasps]

560
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,880
[camera shutter clicks]

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,880
[chuckles]

562
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
[phone chimes]

563
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,600
[Eric] So I have bought crisps,

564
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,440
and some ham,

565
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,840
and some more crisps. I panicked.

566
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,520
- Are we here to have dinner?
- I don't know!

567
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,960
It's what they do in films.
It's supposed to be romantic, isn't it?

568
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,160
[chuckles]

569
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,880
I think I'm a bit scared.

570
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,280
You don't want to anymore?

571
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,280
No. No, no, no. I do. I really do.

572
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,800
It's just, I… I'm worried
that I don't know what I'm doing.

573
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
Well, I don't know either.

574
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,520
[exhales] Don't worry.
I douched before school.

575
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
Uh…

576
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,240
What's wrong?

577
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,680
I, uh, I don't...
This… this isn't what I want. I…

578
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,000
You…

579
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,800
Don't wanna have sex with me.

580
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,320
- Otis was right.
- Otis? What do you mean?

581
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
He said that you would change your mind.

582
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,200
That you weren't comfortable
with yourself.

583
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,120
That this would be too gay for you.

584
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,840
Look, I understand that you're not ready
to tell your mum, but…

585
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,760
If you're not all in,
then I can't be with you.

586
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
[emotional music playing]

587
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Well?

588
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
Say something!

589
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,120
It's just... I don't... It's...

590
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,520
- This isn't what I want.
- [whispers] Fuck's sake.

591
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,520
Excuse me, please. Get off. Get off it!

592
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,240
Ridiculous young man!

593
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
[Eric] Ridiculous.

594
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,560
[Peter] I think
he's pretending to go to work,

595
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,400
which is just so humiliating.

596
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,120
[woman] <i>I know you feel bad for him,</i>

597
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,680
<i>but he's been with us for weeks now.</i>

598
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>It's time for him to go.</i>

599
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,200
[sighs] Okay, I'll tell him. Promise.

600
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
<i>When, Peter?</i>

601
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,280
- Tonight.
- Peter, I'm back!

602
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,800
Gotta go, he's here.

603
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,320
Hey, Michaela! How's work, champ?

604
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Uh… [splutters]

605
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
Great, yes.

606
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,080
- Very good.
- Great.

607
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,680
Lots to do already. Very happy.

608
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
- Look...
- I've got some good news.

609
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,200
I've found a flat to move into, so…

610
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,040
Oh.

611
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Thank fuck for that! [chuckles]

612
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,840
I was gonna ask you to move out.
I didn't want to because it's so awkward.

613
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,520
But, uh, that's fucking brilliant news!
When are you leaving?

614
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,080
[woman] <i>Peter, what's he saying?</i>

615
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,240
[Maeve] Christ.

616
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
- Maeve.
- Anna.

617
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Lovely to meet you. You're so pretty!

618
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,800
Come in. We're playing tea parties
with Elsie's dollies.

619
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,960
Wanna give us a hand?

620
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,280
[emotional music playing]

621
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,960
[mumbling to dolls]

622
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,680
[Elsie] Shall we have some cake?

623
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,240
Would you like a cup of tea?

624
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,040
What about some…

625
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,280
Hi, Elsie.

626
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,040
- Maeve!
- [chuckles] Hello!

627
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Ooh! I missed you!

628
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,680
- [Elsie] I missed you.
- [Maeve chuckles]

629
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,080
[muffled dance music playing]

630
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
- [Otis pants] Yes.
- [Ruby] No.

631
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,520
- [Otis pants] Yes.
- [Ruby] No.

632
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,840
- Oh yes! Yes!
- No. [pants]

633
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,560
[both moaning]

634
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,800
- Yes.
- No.

635
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,240
- [grunts] Yes.
- No.

636
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,840
- Yes!
- No! [pants]

637
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,160
[both panting]

638
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
- Now!
- [grunts] Yes!

639
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
[groans]

640
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,200
- Fuck!
- [pants]

641
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,960
- Ah!
- [sighs]

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,680

00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,080

[panting]

645
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,880
[Ruby] So tomorrow is purple day.
We all have to wear something purple.

646
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,600
- I don't have anything purple.
- I left something out for you.

647
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,360
You what?

648
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
Don't you wanna hang out for a bit?

649
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,720
Uh, my mum's working,
so I'm making dinner for my dad.

650
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,840
He finds it hard to cook now.
It's fine though!

651
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,240
Want me to come and help?

652
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Did you wanna have sex again?

653
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,400
No, just thought
you might want some help with your dad.

654
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,120
I'm fine.

655
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

656
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
[sighs]

657
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
[whimsical music playing]

658
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
[exhales]

659
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
[sighs]

660
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,520
[Jean] You leaving, Ruby?

661
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Hi.

662
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
That's Jakob, my, uh…

663
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,160
- The…
- We're gonna be co-parents.

664
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,880
You're a good-looking couple,
for old people.

665
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
We're not exactly a couple!

666
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,120
Who is this rude person?

667
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,560
Otis's lover, apparently.

668
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,720
Right, "I See You" is an exercise
where you stare into each other's eyes

669
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,640
and articulate the emotions that come up.

670
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
Oh, this is dumb.

671
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,680
Come on. Let's be serious.

672
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,480
[Jakob sighs] Okay. Okay.

673
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
Right, knees touching.

674
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,360
[both breathe deeply]

675
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,160
- You blinked.
- Stop it.

676
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,680
- [laughing]
- Come on. Come on.

677
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,080
- Knees to knees. Come on. You can do it.
- Yeah.

678
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,920
[Jean] Focus, focus, focus. All right.

679
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,520
- [Jean exhales sharply]
- Okay.

680
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
[inhales]

681
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,040
[exhales]

682
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
[emotional music playing]

683
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,800
[breathing deeply]

684
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
So what emotions are coming up for you?

685
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,400
That this is a stupid exercise,
and I really wanna kiss you.

686
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,280
[moaning]

687
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,120
[door closes]

688
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,880
[knocking at door]

689
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,960
Hello.

690
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,880
We need to talk, New Kid.

691
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
[whimsical music playing]

692
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
Would you like some tea?

693
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,800
No, I don't want any tea.

694
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,000
I want you to stop talking shit
to my boyfriend.

695
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,760
Did you and Eric have a fight?

696
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,640
Yes.

697
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,720
No.

698
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
Sort of.

699
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,040
You told him I'm not properly gay,
and now he's angry

700
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,080
because he thinks
I don't wanna have sex with him.

701
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,800
I never said you're not "properly gay."

702
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,200
I said I want Eric to be careful
because you've hurt him in the past,

703
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
and I'm worried.

704
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,200
You should be talking to him
about this, not me.

705
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,760
Tried talking. Doesn't come out right.

706
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,600
What do you mean?

707
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,560
I don't know how to say what I'm thinking.

708
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,360
All the words are there in my head.

709
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,840
I just don't know how to say
the thing that I want to say.

710
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,080
The more I think about it,
the worse it gets.

711
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,880
People are just looking at me,
waiting for me to say something, so…

712
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
So I don't say anything at all.

713
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,680
People think I'm scary or stupid.

714
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
Why do you find it so hard?

715
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,840
I didn't grow up in a naked family.

716
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,880
What's a naked family?

717
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,000
You know, those families
where everyone walks around naked,

718
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,680
talking about how they feel.

719
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,800
Like you and your mum.
Bet you're naked all the time.

720
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,240
We are not.

721
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,720
Do you think your family...

722
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm not here
to do your weird therapy thing.

723
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,000
I just want you to stop talking about me
to Eric. It's none of your business.

724
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,600
I will stay out of it.

725
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,880
[sighs]

726
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,600
Sometimes, it helps
to write down what you want to say first.

727
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,680
I'm not good at writing.

728
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Or you can ask the other person
to close their eyes

729
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,880
whilst you talk to them.

730
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
Sounds stupid.

731
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,080
What I'm saying is,

732
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,960
it might help you think more clearly
about what you want to say

733
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,920
if you don't feel observed.

734
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
It's just a suggestion.

735
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm going now.

736
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,000
You should wear your normal clothes again.

737
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,160
That top makes your neck look very long.

738
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
[Jean exhales deeply]

739
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,600
- [both panting]
- Oh, that was a bad idea.

740
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
Yeah.

741
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,800
[exhales]

742
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
Probably was.

743
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
[both panting]

744
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Well, Dr. Cutton is right.

745
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,200
We do care about each other,
and that can be confusing.

746
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,840
But we're adults, and…

747
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,080
We won't let that happen again.

748
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,960
I think we more than care for each other.

749
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,720
What are you saying?

750
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,400
I think we should be a family.

751
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,600
[both panting]

752
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,320
But she also said
that we barely know each other.

753
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
I don't care what the therapist said.

754
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,840
I think we should be a family, Jean.

755
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
[whimsical music playing]

756
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
[music fades]

757
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,960
Are you still at school, Maeve?

758
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,920
Mm-hmm.

759
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm in my final year.

760
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,080
Well done, you. That's a big achievement.

761
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,360
Why? Because Mum's a junkie?

762
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,200
No, it's a big achievement for anyone.

763
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
[Maeve] Mm-hmm.

764
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,360
And I understand
you don't have a lot of support at home.

765
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,520
Are you in some kind of positivity cult?

766
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,920
No.

767
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,240
It helps
when the social workers come round.

768
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Uh-huh.

769
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,440
You've got a lot of books.

770
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,520
[Anna] Yes, I teach literature part-time.

771
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,840
You can never be lonely
with the company of a good book.

772
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,840
You can borrow that if you like.

773
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
No, thanks.

774
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,840
[breathes deeply]

775
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
When's my mum gonna be able
to come and see Elsie?

776
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,080
She should be here now.
Does she run late often?

777
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,240
Sorry. My mum's coming here?

778
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,280
Yeah, this is a family visit.

779
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,640
- [doorbell rings]
- I assumed you two would've spoken.

780
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,640
- [Anna] Hello, Erin.
- Fuck.

781
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,520
[Erin] Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

782
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,200
- Can I come in or what?
- [door closes]

783
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
Where's my baby girl?

784
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,720
- Mummy!
- [Erin laughs]

785
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,080
[Erin] Oh, darling! [laughs]

786
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Hi, Mum.

787
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,760
What's she doing here? She's the reason
Elsie's in this happy-clappy shithole.

788
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
- Not with me, her flesh and blood.
- That's rude, Mum.

789
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,520
Rude? I'll tell you what's rude.
Calling the police on your own mother.

790
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,640
That's rude.

791
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,320
Okay. I think
I'm gonna come back another day.

792
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,280
Yeah, you do that.
Nobody wants you here. Bye-bye. Bye.

793
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,200
- I love you so much! [kisses]
- [door opens, closes]

794
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
[typing]

795
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,760
Mm.

796
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,440
[computer chimes]

797
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,520
[ethereal music playing]

798
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,640
Hm.

799
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
[knocking at door]

800
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,000
[door opens]

801
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
- Hi.
- [Joe snoring]

802
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,520
[door closes]

803
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,200
Ah, don't worry about him.
He's out like a light.

804
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,840
- [TV plays indistinctly]
- [Joe continues snoring]

805
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
[Maeve sighs]

806
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,440
How was Elsie's new place?

807
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm not sure about the foster lady.
She's a bit of a know-it-all, but…

808
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,720
It was nice.

809
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,120
Until my mum turned up
and told me to get out,

810
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,440
which was less nice.

811
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Shit.

812
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,560
Yeah, it was pretty shit.

813
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,040
Do you want a hug?
Mine are notoriously terrible, but still.

814
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah, all right.

815
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,320
- I'm sure your mum will...
- No. [shushes]

816
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Let's not talk about it. It is what it is.

817
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,160
[Joe snores, groans]

818
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,480
He's disgusting.

819
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,640
- Yeah.
- [Joe snorts]

820
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,880
- [chuckles]
- I'm related to that.

821
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,080
[inhales deeply]

822
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,720
[TV continues indistinctly]

823
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,400
Wait.

824
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,520
- Sorry.
- I…

825
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,760
I've gotta tell you something.

826
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,760
Okay.

827
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,560
The night that your mum
and Elsie went with the police,

828
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,880
that Otis guy came,

829
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,200
and I didn't tell you.

830
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,400
Okay.

831
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,520
He said that he wanted to talk to you

832
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,160
and that he left a message on your phone,

833
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
but you'd… you'd gone to the shops.

834
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,000
And…

835
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,000
I listened to the message.

836
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,200
And I deleted it.

837
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,840
Okay.

838
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,080
What did the message say?

839
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,240
Um…

840
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,880
Something about him
still having feelings for you

841
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,960
and that he felt like
he'd messed things up.

842
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
He said,

843
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,480
"Call me back

844
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,280
if it wasn't too late."

845
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,560
Can you say something, please?

846
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,520
Elsie left weeks ago.

847
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,480
I… I didn't know how to tell you.

848
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,960
It's not an excuse, but…

849
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,400
I was angry

850
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,840
at all the shit that you dealt with.

851
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,800
I don't think Otis understands it at all.

852
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,920
The way that he treated you at that party.

853
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,560
He said that you were a selfish person,

854
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,840
and you are
the least selfish person I know.

855
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
So you went into my private property.

856
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm a dick, I know, but…

857
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,920
[sighs]

858
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,200
…I was doing it
because I was trying to protect you.

859
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,000
You're right.

860
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,560
Otis doesn't understand me.

861
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,720
But neither do you.

862
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,480
Because if you did,
you'd know that I don't trust anyone.

863
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,280

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,240
As head boy,
I'd like to put my case forward

1041
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,040
for saving the Wall of Cock.
It's a piece of school history

1042
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,720
and a form of artistic expression that,
in my opinion, shouldn't be censored.

1043
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,720
What do you think, Vivienne?

1044
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,400
I think the wall should be painted.

1045
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,840
It's vulgar, immature, and doesn't
represent the school in the right way.

1046
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,240
- Yeah, but...
- I agree.

1047

Would you like Jackson's job?

1048
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,920
- Sure, absolutely, yes.
- Wait, what?

1049
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,120
Fantastic. You start today.

1050
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,880
This will give you lots more time
to focus on your artistic pursuits.
