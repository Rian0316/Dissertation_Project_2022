嘿 想听黄芥末酱的趣味知识吗?
Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?

其实 我们不去看电影
Actually, we're not going to the movies.

14
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,956
我们是来绑架你的
We are here to kidnap you.

15
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,291

What are you talking about?

你当初私奔了 所以我们没机会
Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance

17
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:34,527
为你办个告别单身派对

21
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,868
我觉得这不算是绑架
Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.

22
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,036
眼罩呢?
Where's the blindfold?

23
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,271
胶带呢?
Where's the duct tape?

要求我付赎金 而我努力拖延
where you call me and demand ransom

不让你们挂电话 但你们就在

00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,344
我追踪到位置前几秒挂断了
but you hang up seconds before I can trace it

28
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,714
接着我说"我上年纪了 受不了这种刺激"的部分呢?
and then I say, "I'm getting too old for this crud"?

29
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,952
我们什么时候走?
When do we leave?

30
00:00:58,954 --> 00:00:59,886

你们打算怎么逼我呢?
Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?

Sheldon 你马上就会发现

我打赌 他用这辆车接过很多可爱的毕业生
I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.

69
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,049
对 还和他们讨论物理问题!
Yeah, and talked about physics with them!

70
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,453
你能给个提示 我们这是要去哪儿吗?
So, are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed?

71

拜托 Leonard都去告别单身派对了
Come on, Leonard's doing bachelor stuff.

93
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,443
你确定不要我们带你去脱衣酒吧吗?
You sure we can't take you to a strip club?

94
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,145
不用 如果我要看跳舞裸男
Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man,

只需要在Leonard洗澡的时候冲下厕所

我烤了男人生殖器形状的曲奇饼

你真的用不着...

他说他们准备穿过国界了

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,657
希望他们不会在墨西哥玩得太疯

112
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,559
哦 是啊 看好你的女儿

113
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,894

你怎么知道?
How can you be sure?

124
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:44,322
当费曼开这辆车时录像带很流行呢
VHS was king when Feynman drove this van.

125
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,291
说不定在秘密夹层里还有好多
For all we know, there are hidden compartments

126
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:49,127
简方达锻炼的视频呢
lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.

127

如果真有秘密夹层的话
If there was a hidden compartment,

128
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,166
你不觉得你早就被塞进去了吗?
don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?

129
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,804
我们都打了黄热病疫苗了吧?
Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?

130
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:02,307
去墨西哥又没必要打黄热病疫苗

So, Penny, how's married life?

135
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,517
太棒了
Oh, it's good.

136
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,152
我只是希望Leonard能鼓起勇气
I just wish Leonard would work up the courage

137
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:16,721
告诉Sheldon他要搬来住了
to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.

138
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,857
你们还没有住在一起?
You guys still aren't living together?

139
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,826
在一起啊 我是说 他在这睡觉
We are. I mean, he sleeps here.

140
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,260
但Sheldon迟早会因为
But it's only a matter of time

141
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,595
做了噩梦
before Sheldon has a bad dream

142
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,830
然后爬上Leonard的床
and tries to climb into bed

143
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,499
发现里面塞的全是枕头
with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.

144
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,135
说起Sheldon
Speaking of Sheldon,

145
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,369
你的单身生活怎么样?
how's single life treating you?

146
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,171
还好吧 我猜
Fine, I guess.

147
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,739
我一直在关注自己
I've been focusing on me.

148
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,708
我打算把我的衣柜换了
I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.

149
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,810
- 不错啊!  - 太好了!
- Yes!  - Good for you!

150
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,480
但之后我决定不去因为某个男人而
But then I decided I don't want to go changing who I am

151
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:43,782
改变自己
just because of some man.

152
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,651
- 好  - 不错
- Yes.  - Good for you.

153
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,087
其实在分手后改变自己
You know, it is normal

154
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,789
是很正常的事啊
to want to change your look after a breakup.

155
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,625
其实 我打算稍微改变一下
Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.

156
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,960
- 你的毛衣?  - 你的眼镜?
- Your sweater?  - Your glasses?

157
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,528
- 你的发型?  - 你的鞋!
- Your hair?  - Your shoes!

158
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,630
是打耳洞
Piercing my ears.

159
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,298
- 哦  - 哦
- Oh. -  Oh.

160
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,766
你之前真的没打过吗?
You really never had that done?

161
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,235
我妈妈和我说只有
My mom said pierced ears

162
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,204
妓女 海盗和精灵才打耳洞
were for whores, pirates and genies.

163
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,875
但你现在是个成年人了啊
Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.

164
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,544
我知道 但Sheldon
I know, but Sheldon had this clause

165
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:13,879
在恋爱协议里面有一条就是
in the Relationship Agreement

166
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,247
禁止对脸动任何手脚
forbidding cosmetic surgery

167
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,616
除非是整成克林贡人
unless it's to look like a Klingon.

168
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:20,719
我们把你带到商场去打耳洞吧
We'll take you to the mall to get it done.

169
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,287
为什么? 我在这就能打
Why? I can do it right here.

170
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,321
真的吗?
Really?

171
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,856
- 你有耳洞枪吗?  - 没有
- You have a piercing gun?  - No.

172
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,291
你只需要一根针还有冰块
All you need is a needle and an ice cube.

173
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:27,626
我之前打过差不多 十几次吧
I've done it, like, a dozen times.

174
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,194
我不知道啊
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,929
别怕 我会很温柔的
Oh, come on. I'll be gentle.

176
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,098
让我夺走你耳朵的第一次吧
Let me take your ear virginity.

177
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,469
这派对太奇葩了
This party's weird.

178
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,439
嘿 注意速度
Hey, watch your speed.

179
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,974
我听说墨西哥警察专查游客
I hear the Mexican police target tourists.

180
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,943
啊 没问题
Oh, not a problem.

181
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,111
如果发生什么事
If anything goes down,

182
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,879
就把Koothrappali拽到驾驶员座位上
we just put Koothrappali in the driver's seat

183
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,882
然后给他头上戴一顶阔边帽(墨西哥服饰)
and slap a sombrero on his head.

184
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,686
哥们 你一句话能得罪多少种族啊?
Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?

185
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:55,820
我不知道
I don't know.

186
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:58,056
你和我看过奥运会吗?
Have you watched the Olympics with me?

187
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:01,359
Sheldon 你能相信我们正坐在
Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van

188
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,361
二十世纪最伟大的科学家的
that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds

189
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,096
旅行车里吗?
of the 20th century?

190
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,498
就像蝙蝠侠战车一样
It's like the Batmobile.

191
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,867
如果蝙蝠侠是真的
If Batman was real

192
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,335
并是个物理学家
and a physicist

193
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:13,071
而且他车非常丑
and his car wasn't cool.

194
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:14,940
真是令人惊奇
It is extraordinary.

195
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,943
说不定我们能蹭到一点他的天赋
Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us.

196
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,345
坐着这车到他海滨别墅的路上
Maybe between this and his beach house,

197
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,447
我们会有重大的启发
we will be inspired to greatness.

198
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,583
我一般都不信那些鬼神之说
I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans.

199
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,018
但是 我得承认
However, even I must admit

200
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,620
感受着理查德·费曼陷下去的屁股印儿
feeling Richard Feynman's

201
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,223
托住我自己的屁股...
butt dent cupping my own bottom...

202
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:35,060
的确是让创造的精华奔涌飞溅呢
that does get the creative juices flowing.

203
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,096
嘿 这车还是要还的
Hey, I have to return this van.

204
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,532
创造的精华还是留在你的内裤里吧
Keep your creative juices in your pants.

205
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,301
怎么回事?
What was that?

206
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,936
应该是坏了个轮胎
I think it's a tire.

207
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,439
要是有土匪朝我们开枪怎么办?
What if it's banditos shooting at us?

208
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,807
要是我们被绑架了怎么办?
What if we get kidnapped?

209
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,476
要是我们被困在工厂里 余生只能
What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi?atas

210
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,745
靠做辛普森玩偶讨生活怎么办?!
for the rest of our lives?!

211
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,914
只是轮胎坏了
It's the tire.

212
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,916
喂 Leonard?
Leonard?

213
00:07:57,918 --> 00:07:58,950
怎么了?
What?

214
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,519
我上年纪了 受不了这种刺激
I am getting too old for this crud.

215
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,092
Amy 我看到你脸书上的感情状态
Amy, I noticed your status still says

216
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,527
还是写着"恋爱中"
"in a relationship" on Facebook.

217
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,962
你说得对
You're right.

218
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:13,164
我应该让我所有的脸书的好友知道这事
I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know.

219
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,935
Penny 我现在是单身狗了
Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.

220
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,638
你有没有把你的改成 "已婚"?
Did you change yours to "married" yet?

221
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,073
不 还没有
Uh, no, not yet.

222
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,109
有一些人我还没告诉
There's still a few people I haven't told personally.

223
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,176
什么人?
Who?

224
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:26,678
只不过是我父母
Oh, just my parents

225
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,179
和我全家人
and my entire family.

226
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,948
什么?
What?

227
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,016
为什么?
Why?

228
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:32,450
我不想伤害我的爸爸
Well, I don't want to hurt my dad.

229
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,651
他总是想在婚礼上
You know, he always wanted

230
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,320
和女儿一起跳舞
to dance with his daughter at her wedding.

231
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:36,855
他没在你姐姐的婚礼上跳舞吗?
What about your sister's wedding?

232
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,824
本来开始跳了 然后她的羊水破了
They started to, then her water broke.

233
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,894
假如被他发现我们私奔去结婚
You know, if he finds out we eloped,

234
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,062
会伤透他的心的
it's gonna break his heart.

235
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,897
你觉得这事能瞒他多久?
How long do you think you can keep it from him?

236
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,733
对啊 你不觉得拖得越久越糟糕吗?
Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?

237
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,268
不一定啊
Well, not necessarily.

238
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,103
我爸爸年纪也不小了
You know, Dad's not getting any younger,

239
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,705
如果拖得够久
so if I wait long enough,

240
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,473
到时候我就告诉他 是他牵着我走过了红毯
I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle

241
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,008
画面非常感人
and it was magical.

242
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,315
你怎么学会换轮胎的?
When did you learn how to change a tire?

243
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,684
每位有自尊的绅士都应该知道怎么换
Every self-respecting gentleman should know how

244
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,987
这样在路边碰到有困难的姑娘
in case he comes across a damsel in distress

245
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:10,488
他就能去帮忙了
by the side of the road.

246
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:12,991
要是给我看到一只蝎子
If I see one scorpion,

247
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,359
我就爬上你们的肩膀
I am getting on someone's shoulders

248
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,394
我也不下来了
and never coming down.

249
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,630
你的姑娘在那呢
And there's your damsel.

250
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:22,333
哇 这一个卡的好紧
Wow, this one's really stuck.

251
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:23,968
你旋的方向是对的吗?
Are you turning it the right way?

252
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,537
不
No.

253
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,805
我把其他四个都换下来了
I took the other four off

254
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,339
到这一个 我就想
and when I got to this one, I thought,

255
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,208
"老这么旋太没意思了 不如换个口味吧"
"You know, I'm in a rut. Let's shake things up."

256
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,077
让我试试
Here, let me try.

257
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,319
你说得对 换个方向确实旋不下来
You're right, it doesn't turn the other way.

258
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,761
就这样啦
There you go.

259
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:54,727
耳洞打好了!
You're all done!

260
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:56,162
感觉挺不错的
That wasn't so bad.

261
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,065
好漂亮
Nice.

262
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,067
天啊 要是我妈妈看到我
Boy, if my mom could see me now,

263
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,670
她要把我锁进罪孽柜里面壁思过了
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

264
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,173
你在开玩笑吧?
That's a joke, right?

265
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,875
说实话 她才是玩笑
Actually, the joke was on her.

266
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,977
我还能从柜子缝里看电视呢
I could still see the TV through the slats.

267
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,546
我终于明白
I'm starting to see

268
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,615
为什么你和你妈妈的关系不亲密了
why you and your mom aren't very close.

269
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,517
但是她要是结婚了
Bet she'd still tell her

270
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,618
她还是会告诉妈妈的
if she got married.

271
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,587
你抓着这事不放手了吗?
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

272
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,522
他们不知道这事让人很伤心
Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know.

273
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,157
我是说 他们都爱Leonard
I mean, they love Leonard.

274
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,425
好吧 你们要我打电话吗?
Fine, you want me to call?

275
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:26,559
我打电话
I'll call.

276
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,696
为什么我会这么紧张?
Why am I so nervous?

277
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,964
这可以理解
It's understandable.

278
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,700
Amy告诉妈妈她和Sheldon分手的时候也很害怕
Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.

279
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,868
是吗? 后来怎么样了?
Yeah? How did it go?

280
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,135
她有没有逼你爬进
Did she make you crawl

281
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,670
分手抽屉面壁思过?
into the breaking-up drawer?

282
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,907
呃 实际上 说实话...
Uh, well, actually, to be honest...

283
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,467
我还没告诉她
I-I haven't told her yet.

284
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,235
你刚才让我那么不好过
You've been giving me a hard time

285
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,203
而这事你还没告诉你妈妈?
and you haven't even told your mom about Sheldon?

286
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,372
我失血太多有点头晕
I'm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss.

287
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,006
听不清你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

288
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,810
好吧 我在往家里打电话
Fine. I'm calling home,

289
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:55,312
但是等我打完了 你就给你妈妈打电话
but when I'm done, you're calling your mother.

290
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,447
对你来说容易
Easy for you to say.

291
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,749
你又不用拿这个姿势看新闻联播
You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.

292
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:03,520
嗨 爸爸
Hey, Daddy.

293
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:04,788
嗨 伙计
Hey, slugger.

294
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,189
我闺女怎么样了啊?
How's my girl?

295
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,824
呃 挺好的 妈妈在吗?
Uh, good. Is Mom around?

296
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,926
呃 她带你弟弟去庆祝了
Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate.

297
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,796
他刚刚拿到了他的第十个戒酒一月纪念
He just got his tenth one-month sober chip.

298
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:17,767
她会给他做成一条项链的
Yeah, she's gonna make him a little necklace.

299
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,236
好吧 我一会儿再和她说
Okay, I'll talk to her later.

300
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,071
呃 爸爸 我有事要跟你讲
Uh, Dad, there's something I need to tell you.

301
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,207
我和Leonard结婚了
Leonard and I got married.

302
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,375
你结婚了?
You did?

303
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,710
什么时候?
When?

304
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,378
在上星期 对不起 我应该提前告诉你的
Last week. I'm sorry, I should've told you.

305
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,746
当时就是一时冲动
It was a spur of the moment thing.

306
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:30,981
我感觉糟糕透了
I feel terrible.

307
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,349
请千万别太失望
Please don't be too disappointed.

308
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,551
那你高兴吗?
Are you happy?

309
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,552
非常高兴
Very.

310
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,853
Leonard简直太棒了
Leonard is so great.

311
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,688
好吧 那我也为你感到高兴
Well, then I'm happy for you.

312
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,890
呃 谢谢你 爸爸
Aw, thank you, Daddy.

313
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:41,958
你对我真好
That means so much.

314
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,260
呃 如果你一定要告诉某人
Well, I understand it's hard

315
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:44,494
一些可能让他不高兴的事情
to tell someone something

316
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,429
那种感觉很难受
if you think it's gonna upset 'em.

317
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,664
这就是
It is.

318
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,065
你是这世界上最好的爸爸
You're the best dad ever.

319
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,569
是的 呃 先等等
Yeah. Uh, hold that thought.

320
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,904
我也有些新闻没告诉你
I've been sitting on a little news myself.

321
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,539
呃 什么啊?
Well, what is it?

322
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,709
你知道我那个给拖拉机用的碎土器吗?
You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?

323
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,777
不知道啊
No.

324
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,811
呃 你真应该看看
Oh, you should see it.

325
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,481
那机器简直棒极了
It is a beautiful piece of machinery.

326
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:07,217
不过 呃...
Anyway, uh...

327
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,186
我倒车时不小心碾到了你的宠物猪
I backed over your pet pig with it.

328
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,689
"月舞"吗?
Moondance?

329
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,925
是的 呃 它以后没法再跳舞了
Yeah, he's, uh, not dancing anymore.

330
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,894
你杀了我的猪?
You killed my pig?

331
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,130
我没有杀他
I did not kill him.

332
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,465
是在兽医那死的
The vet took care of that.

333
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,200
什么时候?
When?

334
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,270
呃... 大概是十 十二个月以前吧
Oh... ten, 12 months ago.

335
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,973
你竟然瞒了我一整年?!
You didn't tell me for a year?!

336
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,442
呃 有其女必有其父吗 对吧?
Well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

337
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,644
我爱你 伙计
Love ya, slugger.

338
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,313
我得挂了!
Gotta go!

339
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,950
呃 Amy 该你了
Okay, Amy, your turn.

340
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,662
你这是干嘛?
What are you doing?

341
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,631
这个叫做拉玛泽呼吸
It's called Lamaze breathing.

342
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,267
可以帮你用力
It helps you push.

343
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,369
好吧
Great.

344
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:00,770
那你用子宫推好了
He's pushing with his uterus.

345
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,909
应该有个更容易的办法把它弄下来的
There's got to be a smarter way of removing it.

346
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,677
是的 这不过就是个物理学问题罢了
Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.

347
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,945
对
Right.

348
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,714
阿基米德曾经说了
Archimedes once said,

349
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:11,981
"给我一根足够长的的杠杆
"Give me a 'leever' long enough

350
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:13,483
和一个支点
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

351
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,818
我就能撬动地球"
and I shall move the world."

352
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,519
当然
Of course.

353
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,221
我们只需要找点原材料
All we need is to find stuff

354
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,724
把这个杠杆做出来就行了
to make a "leever" big enough to fix this.

355
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:21,958
一点不错
Exactly.

356
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,126
我敢打赌这附近有东西
I'll bet there's something around here

357
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:24,728
能当这个"撬棍"
that could be a "lehver."

358
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,163
让我找找 "撬棍"在哪呢...
Let's see, a "lehver," a "lehver"...

359
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,565
大家等一下!
Everybody hold on!

360
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,300
我们按顺序一个个解决问题
Let's take this problem one step at a time.

361
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,968
首先 我们得决定
First, we need to decide

362
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,270
我们是叫它杠杆还是撬棍
whether we're calling it leever or lehver.

363
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,174
等我们决定叫它杠杆之后
And the sooner we decide it's leever,

364
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:41,044
就可以卷起袖子... 而不是衣袖...
the sooner we can roll up our sleeves... not slehves...

365
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,712
然后再干活
and get to work.

366
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,614
我们就"永久的"在这呆着吧
We're gonna be here "foreever."

367
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,719
真是多谢了 姐妹们
Thanks a lot, guys.

368
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,787
我们做什么了?
What did we do?

369
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,055
在我打电话之前
Before I made that call,

370
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:53,356
我的小猪还是活蹦乱跳的
my pig was alive and happy

371
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,691
在泥地里打滚
and rolling around in the mud.

372
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,060
现在它被非法埋在后院里
Now he's illegally buried in our backyard

373
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,362
和我的曾祖母一起
next to my great-grandmother.

374
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:01,598
真的吗?
Really?

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,501
他们没有把它吃了?
They didn't eat him?

376
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,369
没有
No.

377
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:09,038
它是我们家庭里的一员好嘛
He was a beloved member of the family.

378
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,108
早餐肉家庭是吗?
The breakfast meat family?

379
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,311
这一点儿都不好笑
It's not funny.

380
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,780
该你了 打电话给你妈妈
You're up. Call your mother.

381
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,281
呃 还是等一会吧
Oh, maybe later.

382
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:21,017
我现在为你的小猪之死感到很伤心
Your pig dying made me sad.

383
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,019
还有点饿
And a little hungry.

384
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:24,521
快点 拿电话
Phone, now.

385
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,222
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

386
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,857
我打还不行
Fine.

387
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,995
喂 妈
Hi, Mom.

388
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,329
你得先拨号吧
Try dialing.

389
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,866
被你发现了 是吧?
You saw that, huh?

390
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,139
喂 妈 你最近怎么样?
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

391
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,608
哦 那就好
Oh, good.

392
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,243
工作怎么样?
How's work?

393
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,211
那真不错
That's nice.

394
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,612
我挺好的
I'm fine.

395
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,748
那个 我就是想问一下
Hey, listen, I've been meaning to ask,

396
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,151
Doe阿姨和Florence阿姨为什么关系不太好?
how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?

397
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,519
真是够了... 把电话给我
Okay, just... give me that.

398
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,021
Amy和Sheldon分手了
Amy broke up with Sheldon,

399
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,088
她还打了耳洞
she got her ears pierced

400
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,658
还让我们吃鸡鸡饼!
and she made us eat penis cookies!

401
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:05,962
稍等
Hang on.

402
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,997
她想找你谈谈
She wants to talk to you.

403
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,137
我觉得杠杆好像没什么作用
I don't think the lever's working.

404
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,705
为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

405
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,413
我们一定可以找到别的办法的
There's gotta be something else we could try.

406
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,348
这要是在星际迷航的世界里
If this was Star Trek,

407
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,517
我们就可以用相位枪打爆它了
we could use a phaser to blast it off.

408
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,385
不行 光束太粗了
No, it's too broad of a beam.

409
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,987
需要更精确的东西
You'd need something more precise,

410
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,989
比如超人的热成像仪
like Superman's heat vision.

411
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,324
哦哦 还有绿灯侠的戒指
Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring

412
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,426
可以变出一只绿巨手拧开螺丝
could make a big green hand that unscrews it.

413
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:37,961
要是你需要绿巨手的话
If you need a green hand,

414
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,229
为什么不直接用绿巨人?
why not just use the Hulk?

415
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,797
拜托 绿巨人的脾气那么暴躁
Oh, please, the Hulk would never get

416
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,999
绝对过不了国境线
across the border with that temper.

417
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,601
各位 你们听我说
Guys, excuse me,

418
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,569
找复仇者联盟里的人来帮忙
not that calling one of the Avengers

419
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,805
当然没什么问题
isn't a perfectly reasonable choice,

420
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:49,939
可我们是科学家
but we're scientists.

421
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,608
你们难道不觉得我们应该运用真正的科学
Don't you think we can figure this out

422
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,976
来解决这个问题吗?
using actual science?

423
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,011
没错 我们可以运用科学知识的
Yes, we could use science.

424
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,279
可这是你的告别单身趴啊
But it's your bachelor party.

425
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,680
别那么认真
Lighten up.

426
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,930
科学原理: 冲击 (指由爆炸带来的冲击)

427
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,930
# 我们将 #
# We will #

428
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,066
# 我们将冲击你 # 
# We will percussive shock you #

429
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,702
# 我们将 #
# We will #

430
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,105
# 我们将冲击你 #
# We will percussive shock you #

431
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,108
# 你就是个男孩 #
# Buddy you're a boy #

432
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,576
# 在街上 #
# Make a big noise #

433
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,810
# 大吵大闹 #
# Playin' in the street #

434
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,579
# 以后你总会长大成人 #
# Gonna be a big man someday #

435
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:32,382
# 脸上糊着泥巴 你真丢人 #
# You got mud on your face, you big disgrace #

436
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,318
# 还踢着易拉罐到处乱跑 #
# Kickin' your can all over the place. #

437
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,724
我过目不忘
I have an eidetic memory.

438
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,192
有的时候真不是什么好事
Sometimes it's a curse.

439
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:46,392
科学原理: 热力膨胀

440
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,233
我一直不知道
I had no idea

441
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,935
玉米片是这么好的燃料
tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.

442
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,838
因为它基本上就是溶在脂肪里的碳水化合物
They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat.

443
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,807
但愿那个螺帽能变松点
Let's hope the lug nut expands.

444
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,043
要是我们烧玉米片的味道引来动物怎么办?
What if that burning food attracts animals?

445
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,178
我们有足够多的食物喂动物
We have plenty of food for the animals.

446
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,546
- 是吗?  - 是啊
- We do?  - Yep.

447
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:06,249
毕竟有个一米八的穿着闪电侠T恤的汉子呢
A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.

448
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,685
你这样就不好了吧
That's not very nice.

449
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,553
这是个告别单身趴 别那么认真嘛
It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.

450
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:14,853
科学原理: 加速腐蚀

451
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:18,595
什么东西这么难闻?
What is that awful smell?

452
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:19,829
点燃的墨西哥辣酱
It's burning salsa.

453
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,564
我希望里面的酸和盐
I'm hoping the acidity and salinity

454
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,633
再加上电 能够腐蚀掉螺帽
combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.

455
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,169
这办法太有创造性了
What an innovative solution.

456
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,606
我以前小看你在麻省理工的学历了
Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit.

457
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:32,075
其实 我是在"流言终结者"里看到的
Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.

458
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,275

好了 这些铁锈
All right, this rust,

460
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,852
加上从车上刮下来的铝
combined with the aluminum recovered from the van,

461
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,454
可以充当铝热剂
is now thermite.

开始的时候先少放点
Well, let's start small.

466
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,561
不够的话再加就好
We can always add more.

467
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:54,497
螺帽 算你有本事 给我们出了这么大的难题
You put up a good fight, lug nut,

468
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,201
不过 你终于遇到对手(火柴)了
but you've met your match.

469
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:16,819
嘿 看啊!
Hey, look!

470

我们搞定那个螺帽了
The lug nut's off.

471
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:38,172
你们...
What...

472
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,307
你们怎么回来了?
What are you doing back?

473
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:43,844
我们的车胎爆了
We got a flat

474
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,145
又没法把轮胎卸下来
and couldn't get the tire off.

475
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,980
真同情你们
Oh, I'm sorry.

没事的
Thank you.

477
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,783
要是我告诉你 我帮Amy打了耳洞
If it makes you feel any better,

478
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,085
结果她妈妈罚她待在我衣柜里的话
I pierced Amy's ears

479
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,854
你会不会感觉好点
and her mom made her sit in my closet.

480
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,693
我们把费曼的车烧了

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,033
好吧 你赢了
You win.
