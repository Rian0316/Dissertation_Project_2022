1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,402
Okay, are you from
Star Wars universe?

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,636
Yes

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,005
You were in the original trilogy?

4
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,105
Yes

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:11,143
Is there a picture of you in my wallet
using a metal bikini?

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,046
God, I hope not.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,016
And no, I'm Princess Leia.

8
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,132
Okay, okay, my turn ...

9
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,728
Are you in the six
Star Wars films?

10
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,456
- Yes
- Interesting.

11
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,825
Are you a Droid?

12
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:24,912
Yes

13
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,449
¿Sheldon look like a shiny?

14
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:30,768
Yes

15
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,889
- C-3PO.
- You got it.

16
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:36,160
That is ridiculous.

17
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,360
Do not I look like C-3PO.

18
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,500
Do not misunderstand me. I Alagoas,
just do not see the resemblance.

19
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,651
Leslie Winkle.

20
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,684
Talk to "Friends with rights."

21
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,339
For a call
sex, press one now.

22
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,713
Exactly what ¿
means that expression,

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,424
"Friends with rights?

24
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,347
Do you provide a health service?

25
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,112
No.
Watch ...

26
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,885
Imagine that you hold
a friendship with someone

27
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:13,580
with whom you have sex, but you are
free dating anyone.

28
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,788
Sorry. I can not imagine anything like that.

29
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:19,655
Okay, back to the game.

30
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,352
I think it's my turn.

31
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,738
They can start with
questions when they are ready.

32
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:25,138
Are you Spock?

33
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:31,665
I do not like this game.

34
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,776
So, where were we?

35
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:36,385
Is not going to have sex?

36
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,876
No, it was something else.

37
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:40,537
Why everything has to be
about sex with you? Come on.

38
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,216
Who plays?

39
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,239
We were with you.

40
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,992
Great, just start.

41
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,183
Okay, let's see.

42
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,472
Are you a TV series?

43
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,369
I made it!

44
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,083
I bet that someone from Babylon 5

45
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,893
never guess.

46
00:01:57,363 --> 00:02:00,749
# All our universe was
in a hot and dense state ...

47
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:04,652
# Then for about 14 billion
years, the expansion began ... Wait!

48
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:05,908
# The earth began to cool,

49
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,868
# Autotrophs began to drool the
Neanderthals developed tools,

50
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,765
# Build the wall ...
we built the pyramids,

51
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,605
# Math, science, history
unravel the mystery

52
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:15,588
# That started it all with
a Big Bang!

Why are you leaving?

57

I do not know, just said,

58
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,032
"Howard, Mom is a free spirit."

60
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,776
I do not understand.

61
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,168
If you were in a relationship
not emotional, then

62
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,309
Why do you have what appears
be an emotional response?

63
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,702
Sheldon, obviously
I felt something for her.

64
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:47,740
Of course I felt something for her.

65
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:50,573
I saw her naked, for the love of God.

66
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,803
Okay, you just need
sacártela of mind.

67
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,589
Want to go to the comic shop?

68
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:56,839
Maybe go see a movie?

69
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,284
I do not want to go anywhere.

70
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,515
You know,

71
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,955
I understand that there are
a city in Nevada

72
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,749
specifically designated
to help people like Howard

73
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,525
to forget their problems.

74
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,372
Can replace them with
new problems such as alcoholism,

75
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:15,437
addiction to gambling, and
sexually transmitted diseases.

76
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:23,164
Am I, or that was how
Sheldon said, "Vegas, baby!"?

77
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,443
Never ido.
And you?

78
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,499
Me? No.

79
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,200
Just remember "Vegas, baby!"
by Vince Vaughn in Swingers.

80
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:36,105
Could be fun. My order
week is free, now that ...

81
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,425
Okay, let's do it.
Let's go to Las Vegas.

82
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,656
- Now? Now do the same?
- Why not?

83
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:46,237
People do things now
same all the time.

84
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,612
Why can not we be
people "now" as well?

85
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:51,109
Go home, pack a suitcase,
and let people "now."

86
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,296
That is, should I stop at the pharmacy

87
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:56,217
to fill a prescription, but
after that, we will now.

88
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,679
What do you say, Howard?

89
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,305
I mean ...

90
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,076
"Vegas, baby!"

91
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:03,828
What would you say to your mother?

92
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,635
"Sea World, baby!"

93
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,918
Hey, Sheldon, are you going to come?

94
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,079
Would prefer a fly
scavenger put eggs

95
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,729
and hatched larvae in my ear canal.

96
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,233
Great, you bring a jacket.

97
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,841
Thank you.

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,209
Hello, neighbor.

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,921
Hello, Sheldon.

100
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,569
And how are you doing this pleasant evening?

101
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:36,417
- Great.
- Well, I'm happy.

102
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,000
Really?
Are you drunk?

103
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,455
I'm just in a good mood.

104
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,503
While my compatriots
are in Las Vegas,

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,792
I enjoy
a wonderful night

106
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:48,168
in my Fortress of Solitude staff.

107
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,720
That's the great thing of
Ice Superman, right?

108
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,448
You know, I am such a good mood,

109
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,500
this day in fact
find your poor knowledge

110
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,352
language and enchanting folk.

111
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,384
What smells so good?

112
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:06,232
Such is the intoxicating
Kadhai paneer flavor,

113
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,040
a perfect representation culinary

114
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,817
of freedom which is tonight.

115
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,073
Indian cuisine is not just,
which Koothrappali hate

116
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,008
contains a generous portion of nuts,

117
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,264
thus reduced to a Wolowitz
wheezing ampoule of 44 Kilograms.

118
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:24,776
And finally, its main
ingredient is paneer, a cheese

119
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,936
that would cause Leonard
any habitable room

120
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,592
in a matter of minutes.

121
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,009
Well, enjoy your big night.

122
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,233
Penny.

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,552
I realize that you
are also single tonight

124
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:43,240
then, if, at some point
you find yourself with nothing to do,

125
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,520
please do not bother me.

126
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:47,895
Have fun, Sheldon.

127
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,032
Oh, I will.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,609
No!

129
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,687
What happens, Superman?

130
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,855
Are you staying out of
your big ice thing?

131
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:18,729
Look at that.

132
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,811
Rinse, lotion, body soap,

133
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:24,730
shampoo and conditioner
together in one bottle.

134
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,155
I love Las Vegas.

135
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,626
Howard, Could I have some
after shave lotion?

136
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,451
Black briefcase, upper compartment.

137
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,169
That is a lot of cologne.

138
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:43,505
The first row are <i> musk, the
second is forest aromas, </ i>

139
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:44,904
<i> skins and botanical. </ i>

140
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:48,047
The third is a variety of pheromones.
Use it with care.

141
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,032
That is the spirit, Howard.

142
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,481
Yes, we can.

143
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,495
Go on, come on.

144
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,616
You adelántense only
I have to finish a post.

145
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,160
That is not an email is
Leslie Facebook page.

146
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,492
Okay, okay. I
reviewing their Facebook page.

147
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:16,036
Watch your status update.
He says he left me.

148
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,620
People should know that I left her.

149
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,525
But she left you.

150
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:24,725
Madura, Raj. There is no place
for truth on the internet.

151
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,824
Just go, after the catch.

152
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,529
Okay.

153
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:34,457
We should have a plan in case
that one of us get lucky.

154
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,359
Okay, if I have luck, take

155
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,669
majestic my personality
the outskirts of Gotham, y. ..

156
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:47,140
if you're lucky, sleep on the moon.

157
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,484
It seems a good plan.

158
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,652
Wait, I think the key
emergency is somewhere around here.

159
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,097
We have a bowl.

160
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:59,760
Our keys are in a bowl.

161
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,992
You should get a bowl.

162
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,979
So how was that
brilliant mind of Sheldon Cooper

163
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,144
forgot your key in the first place?

164
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,816
I left it in the bowl.

165
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,561
I just remember where
emergency is the key.

166
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,664
- Where?
- In your apartment.

167
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:18,465
- What do you do in my apartment?
- Well, I was a few weeks ago

168
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,623
when you were not
at home and forgot it.

169
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,200
I entered ...
Why ...

170
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:24,119
What?

171
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,828
It is not so important. Was
making coffee and I ran out of milk.

172
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,596
You're the thief of milk!

173
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:35,134
Leonard said he was crazy, but
knew that the board was light.

174
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,861
Okay, Sheldon.
Just calm down.

175
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,153
Call administrator
building and will open your door.

176
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,044
Just eat your dinner here while waiting.

177
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:45,433
Why, my dinner?
In your department?

178
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:46,493
Yes, why not?

179
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,619
<i> Sure, why not </ i>

180
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,144
And after you get off the sun,
We can get in my truck

181
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,952
and we can go to swim
naked in the stream.

182
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,963
Because today is the day of
fail to make sense.

183
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,039
Thank you.

184
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,248
I tell you, Leonard,
with video slot machines,

185
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:07,360
brought us free drinks
by a waitress big breasts

186
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,032
and all the shrimp
can eat for $ 3.95.

187
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,575
Disneyland can go to hell.

188
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,816
This really is the place
happiest of the earth.

189
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:24,394
My friends, look!

190
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,457
That's the laundry a month!

191
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,008
Hello.

192
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,116
Hello.

193
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,204
What is your name?

194
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:43,003
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

195
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,685
Hi, Rajesh Ra --

196
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,836
Hi, Rajesh.

197
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:49,487
I'm Michaela.

198
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,889
Hello, Michael.

199
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:53,424
So, are you interested
a small party?

200
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,309
Why? Yes, I love the holidays.

201
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,756
Fiesta is my middle name.

202
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:02,237
Or it would if it were not Ramayan.

203
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,508
Raj, can, can
talk to you a moment?

204
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,692
Not now, Leonard.

205
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,800
Michaela invites me to a party.

206
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:10,232
You better call the moon

207
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:12,433
and you make sure that
have a bed for you.

208
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,024
Yes, I really need to talk to.

209
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,120
Sorry, back away.
Do not go anywhere.

210
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,108
Do not move, only
stay there as the beautiful

211
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,694
American natural flower you are.

212
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:27,788
What's the matter, buddy?

213
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,588
She wants all my jammy.

214
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,285
Okay, hate to have
to tell this to yourself

215
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:34,635
and to what is around you "Jammy"

216
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,620
but I'm pretty sure
she is a prostitute.

217
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,200
What?

218
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,832
No. ..

219
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,008
Let me put it like this:

220
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:46,051
Throughout your life,
How many beautiful women

221
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,436
have walked straight to you in a bar

222
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:49,801
and you have asked if
want to go to celebrate?

223
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,730
Maybe I can save her.

224
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,912
Maybe, but I bet it will cost you

225
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,503
as $ 500 for an hour of trying.

226
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:06,376
It was lovely to meet you.

227
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,489
The best of luck in your future.

228
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,799
Whatever.

229
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,991
And strange.

230
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:21,880
Howard is going crazy.

231
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,543
Watch his last message on Twitter.

232
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,673
"I'm at the bottom of a black hole

233
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,376
"noting the abyss.

234
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:30,872
My life has no meaning. My
future has no hope. "

235
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,917
Why do not we
to see the Blue Man Group?

236
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,051
Do you think that would help?

237
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:39,812
USA Today called, "Fun
lush for the whole family. "

238
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,219
I do not know. Howard is not really

239
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,260
class subject
of family fun.

240
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,305
What a pity that no
was here for that bitch.

241
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:50,721
She is exactly the kind a bitch.

242
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:55,695
You know, I bet that if the
hired, we encourage them.

243
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:58,361
We will not get
Wolowitz to a whore.

244
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,583
"I'm just hot,

245
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:09,152
may open this bottle of $ 20
dollars nuts and end all. "

246
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,336
I guess that would not harm
get an estimate.

247
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:23,720
And how was your day?

248
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,760
Trying to talk?

249
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,897
Honey, is not really necessary.

250
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,280
No, the agreement is accepted.

251
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:38,144
How was your day?

252
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,648
Well, they changed my shift

253
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,041
in the restaurant, so my
hours is a little different ...

254
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:46,234
Sorry, that does not interest me
at all, just eat.

255
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:57,106
Hi again.

256
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,354
Hello.

257
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,377
Yeah, hey, listen ...
if you're not busy,

258
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,089
we were thinking
that you could ...

259
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,052
we wondered ...

260
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,997
whether you are a prostitute.

261
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,303
- Are they cops?
- No.

262
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,087
I am a prostitute.

263
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,784
Okay, great.

264
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:26,933
The thing is, we have a friend

265
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,189
and is somewhat sad that I left him.

266
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:31,508
And we think that maybe
you could cheer him up.

267
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,449
With sex.

268
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:36,921
I think he knows what I mean.

269
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,705
How could it when
you walk around the bush?

270
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,992
She is the tough streets

271
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:42,280
where everything is fast and true.

272
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,815
Do not worry, I can
take good care of his friend.

273
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:48,632
Okay, great.

274
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:52,759
Listen, Is there any way
we can do this

275
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:56,160
he knows that without
you're a, you know ...

276
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,951
Prostitute.

277
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:00,753
They want the experience of a girlfriend.

278
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,686
Yes, Yes, exactly.

279
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,280
The experience of a girlfriend.

280
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,170
In fact, if it is not much to ask,

281
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,776
Could be
experience of Jewish bride?

282
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,057
Okay, that is the question 20.

283
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,720
Must guess.

284
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:18,454
I do not know, Sheldon.

285
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,412
Are you a Star Wars?

286
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,913
How can a person
be a movie?

287
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,643
Okay, I give up.
Can we just do something else?

288
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,348
Well.

289
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:32,027
It was Spock.

290
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:39,592
You are friends with Leonard and rights?

291
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,584
What?

292
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,869
You are friends with Leonard and rights?

293
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,493
Whence came this?

294
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:46,612
He said they were?

295
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:47,740
No, Leonard said nothing.

296
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,095
But who knows that happens around here

297
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,624
when he pretends that your mail
was mistakenly delivered?

298
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,199
Mail only, no benefits.

299
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,079
I see.

300
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,708
Why you ask?

301
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,980
I am curious about the whole
social construct.

302
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:04,037
At the hearing, the idea

303
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,192
satisfy the sexual appetites of their own

304
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,125
assuming that it affects such

305
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:11,093
without any emotional entanglement,

306
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,917
That seems remarkably practical.

307
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,637
But what I observed,

308
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:17,838
Howard Wolowitz is crying
as a little girl.

309
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:22,540
Well, some people simply do not
can handle such relationships.

310
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,342
You can?

311
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:28,828
Excuse me?

312
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:30,364
Are you able to have sex with men

313
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,724
are to develop an emotional attachment?

314
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:37,941
Sheldon, I really do not want
talk to you about this.

315
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,358
Is conversation makes you uncomfortable?

316
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,885
Of course it makes me uncomfortable, do not you see?

317
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,133
I really have no idea.

318
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:45,683
I'm not particularly good

319
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,142
reading expressions
facials, body language ...

320
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,516
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

321
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,812
Thanks, that's very helpful.

322
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, where are
these fantastic shrimp?

323
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,229
Contemplated.

324
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,724
Seriously, do you think this is
the size of a baby's arm?

325
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,825
A small baby.

326
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,535
I am going back to the room.

327
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,864
Heck, would you kill
put a little skirt?

328
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,774
Hello, Howard Wolowitz.

329
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,911
Esther Rosenblatt.

330
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,977
I do not think the manager comes
tonight, then shot.

331
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,025
¿It suggests that sleep on the couch?

332
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,968
Well, it was not the first
suggestion that occurred to me,

333
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,104
but what I have to choose.

334
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:54,320
I can not sleep in your
sofa, sleep in a bed.

335
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,409
And given its size

336
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,512
I have no intention of
experience the children's book

337
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,473
of E.M. Snickering, The
tall man in Cornwall. "

338
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:03,471
What?

339
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,960
"It was a tall man in Cornwall

340
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,968
"whose height exceeded his bed.

341
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,205
"My body is, but just above it,

342
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,828
no room for me
English large head. "

343
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,629
Okay, I'll give you my
bed with a condition:

344
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,865
that promise to seal your mouth
for the following eight hours.

345
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,216
Can I say one last thing?

346
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,105
Only if you do not rhyme.

347
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:34,872
Agreed.

348
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,168
Good night.

349
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:46,129
What excites me?
Let me see.

350
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,183
Read a good book in front of the campfire

351
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:50,736
Long walks on the beach ...

352
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,537
and getting rare in the Sabbath

353
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,040
a burger with bacon.

354
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,807
Really? Also yo!

355
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,759
Oy gevalt, you are burning.

356
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,865
Yes

357
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,207
Excuse me a moment.

358
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,083
Hey, how are you going?

359
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,667
The devil, fix this, right?

360
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,544
Yes

361
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,272
It's a bitch, is not it?

362
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,197
A prostitute, yes.

363
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,871
You gave him the money?

364
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,456
Yes

365
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,185
<i> Thanks! </ i>

366
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,435
Penny <i> ¿</ i>

367
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:43,748
What?

368
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,164
<i> I can not sleep. </ i>

369
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,344
Perhaps because
your mouth is still open.

370
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,448
Strange home.

371
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,888
Your house is about 6 meters from here.

372
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:01,016
6 meters, 6 light years, never mind.

373
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,315
It's in a galaxy far, far away.

374
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,067
Damn.

375
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:12,922
What do you do?

376
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,443
Sing, "Soft kitten."

377
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:20,930
That's just when you're sick.

378
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,474
Long for the home is
a type of disease.

379
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,521
Come on, is it really necessary?

380
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:34,091
I guess we can
stay awake and talking.

381
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:39,791
# Soft kitty,
loving kitty

382
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:42,376
# Small ball of hair,

383
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,696
# Kitty Happy ...

384
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,072
# Kitty sleepy.

385
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:50,848
- # Gatito sleepy ...
- No.

386
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,695
Begins again.

387
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:02,769
# Soft kitty,
loving kitty

388
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,258
# Small ball of hair,

389
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,208
# Kitty Happy ...
Sleepy kitten.

390
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,742
- Penny?
- Yes?

391
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,677
Thanks for letting me stay here.

392
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,310
Nothing, honey.

393
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,201
Okay, I got sleepy.
Out.

394
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:39,622
Well.

395
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,102
Finally at home.

396
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,604
What were you doing at the home of Penny?

397
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,788
Well, dinner,

398
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:47,301
play some games
and then spent the night.

399
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,356
Be happy to know that I now have

400
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:53,812
a much better understanding
"Friends with rights."
