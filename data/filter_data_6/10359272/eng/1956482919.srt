00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,245
- (truck horn blares)
- Fuck!

4
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,248
I-I know that it looks bad.

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:18,125
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,460
You are cut off.

7
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,794
I-I-I don't think
it's the best time

8
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:22,087
for me right now.

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,630
You don't really
have a choice here.

10
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,966
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

11
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,969
- You know, I think I got a lot of fucking choices.
- Come on, Jade.

12
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,513
I think maybe
the best way to help him

13
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,640
- is to stay here.
- Fuck you both.

14
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:35,142
(door opens)

15
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:36,643
KARL:
<i>Uh, I have an appointment.</i>

16
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,145
SIMONE:
<i>And would this appointment</i>

17
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:39,563
involve your new boyfriend
Hector?

18
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:41,482
He may tag along, yes.

19
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:44,443
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

20
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:45,861
Care to join me?

21
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:48,071
- You should go.
- You'll be okay?

22
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,364
I'll be delightful.

23
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,408
(laughs)

24
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:55,829
You've got get over
this obsession

25
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:56,955
with another woman's husband.

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,290
I'm pregnant.

27
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,502
How do you think he'll react?

28
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,837
- He will be thrilled.
- Come clean.

29
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:05,964
Tell him you know about
the affair and the baby.

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,549
What if...

31
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,343
he doesn't choose me?

32
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:12,638
Aren't you done
with all the lies?

33
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,390
- We definitely need to have a talk.
- You're starting to scare me.

34
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:16,725
I'm scared, too.

35
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,310
<i>Once I tell you,</i>

36
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,020
everything is going
to be different.

37
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,605
Are you sick?

38
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:23,732
I'm sick.

39
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:24,858
Baby, what's wrong?

40
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,318
I have cancer.

41
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,737
(sobbing):
Oh, my... oh, my God.

I'm not sure when.

62
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:50,485
I just know
one day I won't be here.

63
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,446
I'm afraid to meet God.

64
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,281
I'll have to account
for my sins.

65
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:56,491
I have sinned a lot.

66
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,952
I had an affair
with a married man.

67
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,954
I slept with another guy's wife.

68
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,582
I had sex with a married couple

69
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,585
and pretty much everyone else
I ever met.

70
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:08,962
Now I'm pregnant and unmarried.

71
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,673
My mom has no idea
I've fallen in love.

72
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:14,426
Taylor doesn't know
I gave Eli drugs.

73
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:16,511
I'm not going to tell Rob.

74
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,805
I'm gonna propose to Simone.

75
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,099
I'll probably deny everything.

76
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:25,020
When I do meet God,
I'll just beg his forgiveness.

77
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:28,106
I'll thank him for sending me
the perfect woman.

78
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,109
I'll say I did what I had to

79
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:33,153
to survive.

80
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,238
(laughs)

81
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,830
Sheila.

82
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,832
SHEILA:
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,336
I've been on pins and needles.
Did you talk to Rob last night?

84
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,337
I did.

85
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,965
So? I'm dying here.

86
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:54,967
How did he react
when you told him

87
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,843
you knew that he was
cheating on you?

88
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,804
Well,

89
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:03,016
the conversation went
in a surprising direction.

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,352
(speaking indistinctly)

91
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:08,188
You said what?
You said what?

92
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:09,815
What? How could
you say that?

93
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,400
How could you say
that, Beth Ann?

94
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,986
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

95
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,154
I can't even believe
you just said that!

96
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,407
Get back here
so I can give it to you!

97
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,203
It's your mother's fault.

98
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,373
Clearly, she forgot to teach
you some of the basics.

99
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:31,044
Things like, when you grow up,
don't pretend to have cancer.

100
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,339
Women lie to
their husbands every day.

101
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,091
Some lie about
how much they spend.

102
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,176
My lie's that I'm dying.

103
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,053
Just because
you act classy

104
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:42,055
doesn't mean you're
not fucking crazy.

105
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,932
There is a method
to my madness.

106
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,560
Rob will never leave me
while I'm sick.

107
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,603
But what if April decides

108
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,106
to tell him that
she's having his kid?

109
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,067
That is where her good friend
Sheila comes in.

110
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,069
I'm going to convince her
to leave town.

111
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,447
Start a new life,
sever the tie for good.

112
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,240
And then, once she's out
of the picture

113
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:01,742
and I have Rob
all to myself,

114
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,704
my cancer will be
miraculously cured.

115
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:08,123
I used to find
that little grin charming.

116
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,208
Now it just scares
the shit out of me.

117
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,752
NURSE:
Ladies.

118
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:13,879
The doctor will see you now.

119
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,923
SHEILA:
Enzo.

120
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,759
Aunt Sheila.

121
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,802
Look at you in the white coat.

122
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,555
This is my neighbor,
Beth Ann Stanton.

123
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,183
Beth Ann, my nephew, Enzo.
The doctor.

124
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,185
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Stanton.

125
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,270
Likewise.

126
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,900
So, Sheila says
you studied oncology.

127
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,568
For a little while,

128
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,904
- and then I switched to hematology.
- Oh, still,

129
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:41,615
I bet you remember lots
of useful tidbits.

130
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:44,117
I suppose so.
How can I help you?

131
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,786
Well, I was wondering

132
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:49,081
if there was a cancer
you could recommend.

133
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,792
- Recommend?
- Something rare.

134
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,460
That no one's ever heard of.

135
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:54,628
It should be serious.

136
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,588
Oh, but occasionally curable.

137
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,257
I'm sorry...

138
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,551
- And symptoms. She's gonna need symptoms.
- (gasps)

139
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:03,804
Oh, some symptoms
would be lovely.

140
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,598
Just wait a...

141
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,475
What exactly
are we talking about here?

142
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:09,935
SHEILA:
Enzo.

143
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:14,523
I say this to you as your aunt
and a Sicilian:

144
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,150
The less you know, the better.

145
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,778
Okay.

146
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,488
Um, rare cancers.

147
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:26,535
What about...

148
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:30,330
Epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma.

149
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,165
Say that again.

150
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,834
I'd rather not.

151
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,169
That's the cancer you have?

152
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,171
It affects soft tissue.

153
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:39,673
I'd give you the details,

154
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,675
but they're disgusting
and we're having fondue.

155
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:43,468
(sighs)

156
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:47,139
God, I wish you'd let me go
to the doctor's with you.

157
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,974
You always get
so emotional.

158
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:52,185
No. I prefer to go
with Sheila.

159
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,146
Now, I'm going to set the table.

160
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,190
Wait. Wait.
At least tell me your prognosis.

161
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,526
I will, but I don't want
to ruin our meal.

162
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,528
Beth Ann!
Please, just tell me!

163
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,573
Fine.

164
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,993
But I need you to be strong.

165
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:11,037
Can you do that for me, Robert?
Can you be my brave boy?

166
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,206
Yeah.

167
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,208
Well,

168
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,420
it seems I only have
six months to live.

169
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,714
Six months!

170
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,757
But that doesn't mean
I can't recover.

171
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,219
- Miracles happen every day.
- (crying)

172
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:29,890
But the doctor feels
we should prepare for the worst.

173
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,100
It sounds like
he's giving up already.

174
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,768
We should get a second opinion.

175
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:38,273
No. I mean, what is
another doctor going to say?

176
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,108
I don't have cancer?

177
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:44,571
No, this is the situation,
and we all must accept it.

178
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:45,947
Okay?

179
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,574
Okay.

180
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:51,411
Now, obviously, if I'm going
to fight this thing,

181
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:54,664
I need you by my side.

182
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,958
Constantly.

183
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,590
You're my wife.

185
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,926
I meant it when I said,

186
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,844
"Till death do us part."

187
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,556
Oh, my darling.

188
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:16,144
I'm going to hold you to that.

189
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:18,897
This is hard.

190
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,107
I've never packed
for a three-month trip before.

191
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,901
Oh, packing for three months
is easy.

192
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:25,779
I do it every time
I go away for the weekend.

193
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,406
These look sturdy.
Should I try them on?

194
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,908
Knock yourself out.

195
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:35,997
Hey, I know we agreed that you'd
fly to Paris a week after me,

196
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,874
but wouldn't three days
be enough?

197
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,793
Or even two?

198
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,962
You can't wait one week?

199
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:44,798
We need as much time
for sex as possible.

200
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,758
Remember, you said you'd
make love to me in

201
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,260
every city in Europe.
What am I supposed

202
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:50,095
to do on my own
for a whole week?

203
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,471
Beat it.

204
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,973
That's cold.

205
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,183
Oh, not you.

206
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,185
What do you think?
Do you like them?

207
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,020
Oh, what are all
the pockets for?

208
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,188
Carrying stuff.

209
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,190
They'll be great
for hiking over the Alps.

210
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,109
- Hiking over the Alps?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:07,112
Good Lord, are we taking a
vacation or fleeing the Nazis?

212
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:16,162
I'm starting to think that we're
imagining very different trips.

213
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,957
Well, I want our vacation
to be elegant, romantic.

214
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,959
(gasps) Nights at
la Comédie-Française,

215
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,335
dinner at Maxim's.

216
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,170
Yeah, well, I can't
afford those things.

217
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,006
Oh, well,
if that's the problem...

218
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,799
No, I know you can
afford those things,

219
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:30,677
but I-I don't want to
feel like your gigolo.

220
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,138
- I have an idea.
- What?

221
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:36,224
Return my brooch
and get your money back.

222
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:39,519
What you spent on it can buy
a whole lot of escargot.

223
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:42,355
I bought you this to show you
what you mean to me.

224
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,357
Well, find another way
to show me.

225
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:45,692
Like what?

226
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:46,860
You're an artist.

227
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,820
Use your imagination.

228
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,912
Okay.

229
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,457
I'll see what I can
come up with.

230
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,423
Taylor.

231
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:09,716
What are you doing here?

232
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,635
Can we talk for a sec?

233
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:22,604
My mom got sick when I was ten.

234
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:26,858
From that point on, it was
just us, so I had to step up.

235
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,903
But it was good, because
I learned to take charge.

236
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,905
I found out I could
figure out the solution

237
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,782
to any problem
that came my way.

238
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:36,242
Until last night.

239
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:41,915
I sat in that hotel room
until dawn

240
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:45,877
trying to figure out
how to fix this thing with Eli.

241
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:49,923
And I just can't.

242
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,133
I'm so sorry.

243
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,594
You know, when Eli
O.D.'d last time,

244
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,429
I knew exactly what to do.

245
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:00,016
I got him into rehab,
I paid off his debts.

246
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:04,604
But I think that a part of him
always resented me

247
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,273
for managing the situation
in a way that he couldn't.

248
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:10,443
And now he's just
so angry at me.

249
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:14,447
And I don't think
he'll let me help him.

250
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,534
And I'm so scared of what
will happen if I can't.

251
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,786
Eli is not going to die.

252
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,580
He will
if he doesn't stop using.

253
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,961
But the good news is
he still listens to you.

254
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,255
So I am begging you. Please.

255
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:31,756
You are my last hope.

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,133
Of course, yes. Totally.

257
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,427
I'm totally with you.
I promise.

258
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,805
Thank God. You have no idea
how much that means to me.

259
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,851
(sighs) Okay.

260
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:46,646
We have to move fast, before the
money comes in for Eli's script.

261
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:49,107
You're worried he's gonna
spend it all on drugs?

262
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,942
Not just drugs.

263
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:53,278
When Eli's using,
he gets stupid generous.

264
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,322
- Stupid generous?
- Oh, yeah.

265
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:58,158
The last time,
he bought gifts for everyone.

266
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,452
Rolex watches, designer shoes.

267
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:03,455
When he's high, he just wants
everyone to be as happy

268
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,623
as he is.

269
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,333
So, I've been thinking of ways

270
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:11,045
that we can handle this
covertly.

271
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,133
And I have one idea, but it...
it's kind of crazy.

272
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:17,343
I like crazy.

273
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,554
The next time
Eli's in the shower,

274
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:23,808
I need you to go into his phone
and find all of his passwords.

275
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,144
What?

276
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,021
The code to his phone
is 0-4-2-9.

277
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,023
Just here, look,
I wrote it down for you.

278
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,025
If we can get access

279
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,027
to his his business accounts
and his credit cards,

280
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,528
we can cut off
his cash flow.

281
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,696
Oh.

282
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,156
And I'm gonna call his dad.

283
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,033
How will that help?

284
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,701
Eli is terrified of his dad.

285
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,746
Jake will force him to admit
who got him using again.

286
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,875
(laughs softly)
Why does that matter?

287
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,668
He was clean
for two years,

288
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:51,878
and then suddenly he's not?

289
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,546
No, I need to know
what happened.

290
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:55,924
Of course.

291
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,176
And I want to help,
but is this really

292
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,887
- the best plan?
- What do you mean?

293
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,472
Look, you remember how you felt
when you thought

294
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:04,057
that Eli and I were
ganging up on you.

295
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,892
How is he gonna feel
if it... if it seems

296
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,393
like we're ganging up on him?

297
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:08,895
So what do you propose we do?

298
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:11,648
Give me a few days
and I'll reason with him.

299
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,608
You really think
you can talk him into this?

300
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,361
Trust me.
I'll get through to him,

301
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,404
he'll come home,

302
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,615
and we'll all be a family again.

303
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,037
Look who's here!

304
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,123
- Karl, it's the Sitwells!
- You're back from Scotland, I see.

305
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,417
And we're meeting Rex
and Julie for dinner.

306
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,794
They should be
here any second.

307
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,629
Oh, I love her.
She thinks I'm pretty.

308
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,714
We all think you're pretty.

309
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,758
But she says it out loud.

310
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:39,551
(Hank and Denise chuckling)

311
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,302
Tell you what...
when they get here,

312
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,887
why don't you bring them over
to our table?

313
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:43,888
We'll dine together.

314
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:46,182
Wonderful. Then you can
tell us about your plans

315
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,101
for Amy's
lavish wedding.

316
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:50,436
We're so excited.
We can't wait.

317
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,105
- Mm.
- I can't wait, either.

318
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:53,314
(laughs)

319
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:54,691
For it to be over.

320
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,568
Yes, I was thinking
the same thing.

321
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:58,069
Oof, are we terrible people?

322
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:59,946
No. Weddings
are exhausting.

323
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,782
Besides, we need to conserve
our energy for our male lovers.

324
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:04,784
At least yours isn't younger
than the groom.

325
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,578
Yeah, I think the, uh,
stepfather of the bride

326
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:07,620
should have at least

327
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:09,247
an age-appropriate boyfriend.

328
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,082
- (chuckles)
- Call me old fashioned, but I just do.

329
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:14,127
Oh, Karl.
What's that on your face?

330
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,420
What?

331
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,463
Oh, my God, are you
wearing makeup?

332
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:18,840
Less than you.

333
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,758
You really are
spreading your wings.

334
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,802
I think I'm leaving
the country in the nick of time.

335
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:26,639
- I'm off to the ladies' room
- I'll order you a gimlet.

336
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,725
♪ ♪

337
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,819
Simone?

338
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:40,987
Hi.

339
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,823
(toilet flushes,
stall door opens)

340
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,284
Uh, you are Dr. Bennett's
wife, right?

341
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,495
Maureen. I also work
in his practice as a nurse.

342
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,331
Well, isn't that nice?

343
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,167
I don't know
quite how to say this.

344
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,629
But... do you know
your husband's a homosexual?

345
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,634
Yes, I know.

346
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,719
And you said it just fine.

347
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,804
I realize it's none
of my business.

348
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,473
I'm just trying to
be a good person.

349
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:12,352
And like all good people, you
just couldn't wait to tell me.

350
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,230
I'm going now.
Feel free to adjust your halo.

351
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,483
Has Karl told you
he's sick?

352
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:21,027
What?

353
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,612
I can see he hasn't.

354
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:27,075
Karl isn't sick.

355
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,702
He saw my husband
three days ago.

356
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:30,828
He has that new disease

357
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,205
that all the gay men
are spreading.

358
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:34,040
That's a lie.

359
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:36,042
He's the third man
my husband's seen who's had it.

360
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,045
The first two
are dead.

361
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,839
I'm so sorry.
I just thought you should know.

362
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:50,890
(laughter)

363
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,225
KARL:
I know, I know, I know,

364
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,060
I know, I know
it sounds unbelievable

365
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,896
and faintly ridiculous,
but bear with me on this...

366
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:00,483
Oh, hello, darling.
It's perfect timing.

367
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,735
I was just telling everyone
the story of our trip to Venice,

368
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,905
when you accidentally knocked
that gondolier into the water.

369
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:08,241
HANK: Now,
did that really happen?

370
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,326
Or is Karl just
embellishing?

371
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:16,040
No, that-that's not the kind
of thing Karl would lie about.

372
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:18,751
So, there he was,
dripping wet,

373
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:21,963
hacking up great lungfuls
of the Grand Canal,

374
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,131
and I realized
it's very difficult

375
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,549
to maintain
one's dignity...

376
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:25,925
(voice fading)

377
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,010
♪ ♪

378
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,003
(door opens)

379
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,880
Hey.

380
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,883
- Hey. Where have you been all morning?
- Ah... out.

381
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,009
Doing stuff.
Doing great stuff, in fact.

382
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,677
Come with me outside.
I've got something to show you.

383
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:45,055
- Come on.
- You never came to bed last night.

384
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,598
Did you get
any sleep at all?

385
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,225
No. No, it turns out
one of the side effects

386
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,353
of near-constant cocaine use
is a wee bit of insomnia.

387
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:52,646
Come on.

388
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,359
- Oh! Wow!
- Right?

389
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:58,527
You like it?

390
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,780
- It... uh... you bought this?
- I did.

391
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,741
Well, uh, technically
American Express bought it.

392
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:05,825
But that bill's gonna get paid

393
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,744
the second my first script
payment comes through.

394
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:08,703
You like it?

395
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:11,456
Look, I know you've been
working really hard,

396
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,542
and I get that you'd want
to treat yourself...

397
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,834
Me? No. Whoa.
(chuckles)

398
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,920
No, I didn't...
This isn't for me.

399
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,423
Y-You bought me a car?

400
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,217
I did.

401
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,136
- Shut. Up.
- I won't.

402
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,264
This is me saying thank you.

403
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,266
- For what?
- My God, for everything.

404
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,102
For all the help
you gave me with the script.

405
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,104
For standing by me when Taylor
lost her mind...

406
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:37,941
Oh, God... Taylor's
not gonna like this.

407
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,235
Well, you know what?
Taylor doesn't get a vote, okay?

408
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,614
It looks expensive.
Are you sure?

409
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,575
Well, I made you
a promise, right?

410
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:48,785
I said when this money
came through,

411
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,997
I would take care of you.

412
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,500
People have made me
a lot of promises in my life.

413
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,755
Nobody's ever kept one before.

414
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,008
Well, this is me keeping mine.

415
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,635
And this is
just the beginning.

416
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,806
So... do you like it?

417
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,477
It's perfect.

418
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,328
Just keep
going straight.

419
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,330
So I've been doing
some research,

420
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,956
finding jobs a
pregnant woman can do.

421
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,207
I already have a job.

422
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,918
You shouldn't be on your feet
all day when you're expecting,

423
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:41,212
but don't worry.
There are plenty of ways

424
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,298
a girl in your condition
can make a living.

425
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,674
Are there?

426
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,676
Sure. You could be

427
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,303
a pin setter in
a bowling alley.

428
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:50,347
All you'd have to do
is punch buttons.

429
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,351
- I found an opening at an alley in Anaheim.
- Now take a left.

430
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,356
BETH ANN: Or... there's a place
hiring switchboard operators.

431
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,066
For that, you'd have
to move to Barstow.

432
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,692
It sounds like you're
trying to get rid of me.

433
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,861
Don't be silly.

434
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,907
I just thought it might
be easier for you

435
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,242
to make a fresh start
in a new city.

436
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:13,870
- Well, I'm not moving.
- Okay.

437
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,955
Just know I'm here for you.

438
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,041
For anything you need.

439
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:21,169
Thank you.

440
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:24,673
Oh... uh, pull over,
this is it.

441
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,812
This must be
a mistake.

442
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:40,689
A doctor wouldn't have
his office in here.

443
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,607
No, this is it.

444
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,360
Are you sure you have
the address right?

445
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,946
Sheila, I lied. I'm not
here to see a doctor.

446
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,911
(shudders)

447
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,706
I don't understand.

448
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,250
I'm sorry. I just
can't have this baby.

449
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,419
What are you
talking about?

450
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,380
Please do not make me
say this out loud.

451
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,758
What you're going
to do, it's illegal.

452
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,969
(exhales)
I know.

453
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,238
God, how did you even
hear about this place?

454
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,073
A girl at the
diner referred me.

455
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:33,950
You...

456
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,118
Excuse me.

457
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,911
You can't do this,
it's not right.

458
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:40,040
Sheila, please do not make this
harder than it already is.

459
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,676
I'm Sally Jones.
We spoke on the phone.

460
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,429
Who's she?

461
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:55,472
My friend.

462
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,183
She'll drive me home afterwards.

463
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,477
- You got the money?
- I do.

464
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,228
Come on in.

465
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,566
Sheila. Please.

466
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,070
I really need a friend
right now, more than ever.

467
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,455
- Here you go, son.
- Thank you, sir.

468
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:21,831
I'll have your car here
in just a second.

469
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,168
- Terrific night.
- Lovely seeing you all.

470
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,128
Let's do it again
very soon.

471
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:29,297
Good night, Simone.
See you at the wedding.

472
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:36,304
All right, we're alone.
You can tell me now.

473
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:37,847
Tell you what?

474
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,183
How I've upset you.
And don't say you're fine.

475
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,852
You've barely said two words
to me the entire evening.

476
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,854
Wait till
we're in the car.

477
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:48,191
Can I at least have
a headline?

478
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,236
I ran into your doctor's wife
in the ladies' room.

479
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,238
Don't think I've ever met her.

480
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:56,241
She also works as a nurse.

481
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:57,700
(quietly):
In his office.

482
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,624
What did she say?

483
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,502
You're sick.

484
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:13,466
Well, two things:
first of all...

485
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,968
I'm not sick.

486
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,054
Secondly, what a gossipy bitch.

487
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,057
- Are you saying she lied?
- I'm not... symptomatic.

488
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,518
- I feel fine.
- So what's the makeup hiding?

489
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:24,686
A spot.

490
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:26,563
- Don't you mean a lesion?
- Oh, come on,

491
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:27,897
it's miniscule.

492
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,733
Do you have any idea
how scared I am?

493
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,861
- You don't have it.
- What?

494
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:35,363
Look, the fact is, it can only
be transmitted through blood

495
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,240
or bodily fluids,
and we rarely had sex,

496
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:38,783
and never without a condom.

497
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,577
Is that what you think?

498
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,372
- That I'm scared for myself?
- Darling, darling, darling,

499
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:47,959
I, I, I...
I should have told you,

500
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,712
my love, I just...

501
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:53,256
I did... I just didn't want
to spoil your trip.

502
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,425
Oh, God, the trip.

503
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,343
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I-I-I promise

504
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,930
I... I-I will call once
a week while you're away,

505
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,266
with, with full
medical updates.

506
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,268
You think I'm still going?

507
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,562
That I'd leave you
at a time like this?

508
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,939
And what would staying achieve?

509
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,774
Other than letting me know

510
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,776
that you think I won't make it
past Labor Day?

511
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,074
You need care, Karl.

512
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:24,913
Specialists. And at least
one doctor whose wife

513
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:28,082
is not the goddamn town crier!

514
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,460
I know how much
Tommy means to you.

515
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,129
I'm staying with you,
and that is the end

516
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,715
of this discussion.

517
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,554
(quietly):
Thank you.

518
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:54,609
- Do you want some whiskey?
- Whiskey?

519
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,487
It's good to get a little
drunk before you start.

520
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,947
Helps with the pain.

521
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,824
- No, thank you.
- Suit yourself.

522
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,451
Just give me a couple
of minutes.

523
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:07,038
I got to get some plastic
over the table.

524
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:09,332
She's doing this
in the kitchen?

525
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,460
Apparently.

526
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:14,504
But it's an
invasive procedure.

527
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:18,383
It requires a clean environment.
Sterilized instruments.

528
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:20,134
Well, this is all
I can afford.

529
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm out of options, Sheila.

530
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,723
Please understand.

531
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,644
(sighs)

532
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,691
There's something
you don't know.

533
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,275
There's something
I need to tell you.

534
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,404
What's that?

535
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,701
I had a child once,

536
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,828
but she died.

537
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:52,291
I left the gate
to the backyard open.

538
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,252
She wandered out
into the street

539
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:57,797
and she was hit
by a car.

540
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,678
It's been years, but I think
about her every day.

541
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:07,724
Sometimes,
late at night,

542
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:11,185
I wonder what kind
of young woman

543
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,730
she'd have
turned into.

544
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:18,568
How could you tell me
something like that right now?

545
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,362
Are you... are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

546
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:23,448
- No, you don't understand.
- No, I think you don't understand, Sheila.

547
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:26,576
- I have to do this.
- Honey, I'm trying to say...

548
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,581
I think my daughter would have
grown up to be a lot like you.

549
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,584
That is one of the reasons
I love you.

550
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,754
But right now
I'm afraid for you

551
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,131
because women die
in places like this.

552
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:41,424
I can't
let that happen.

553
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,760
Sheila, I'm single
and I'm broke.

554
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,803
I can't raise a baby.

555
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:49,265
We'll figure it out.
We just need time to think.

556
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,476
- Let me help you.
- How?

557
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,896
Well, I'll...

558
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:58,441
I'll get some... I'll get
my hands on some money.

559
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,444
We can go somewhere else,
somewhere safe, but please,

560
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,571
let's get out of here.

561
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,367
Okay. Okay.

562
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,628
(phone ringing)

563
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,630
Hello?

564
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,508
Yeah, this is she.

565
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:26,761
No, I haven't lost my Amex. Why?

566
00:26:26,844 --> 00:26:28,638
Suspicious activity?

567
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,599
Um, how much was spent?

568
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,985
TAYLOR:
Nice car.

569
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:43,986
Taylor.

570
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,489
- Were you in the house?
- I came to talk to Eli

571
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,158
so he could explain to me
why my credit card is maxed out,

572
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:52,328
and then I saw you pull up
in this brand-new car.

573
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,996
Well, I-I don't know
when he'll be home.

574
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,498
He has a meeting
at Paramount and...

575
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,334
He bought it for you, didn't he?

576
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,212
I told him
it was too much.

577
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,880
- When?
- The moment he gave it to me.

578
00:27:02,964 --> 00:27:06,217
No. I'm asking
when did he give it to you?

579
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,346
Before I saw you in the park
this morning or after?

580
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,516
After.

581
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,685
So why didn't you insist
he take it back?

582
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,646
I was so surprised,
I didn't know what to say.

583
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:21,524
Surprised? Jade, I had just
told you that when Eli is high,

584
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,569
- he's stupid with money.
- Well, I don't think it's stupid.

585
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,864
I spend every day
cooking and cleaning,

586
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:32,076
running errands
and looking after you both.

587
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,703
I think it's nice
that someone actually

588
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,329
wanted to say
thank you.

589
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:38,541
You want a thank you?
Okay, fine, Jade.

590
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,917
Thank you.

591
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,502
Now give me
the keys.

592
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:44,380
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm gonna return the car, obviously.

593
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,756
No.

594
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,884
- What do you mean no?
- You can't return the car.

595
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,261
It's not yours.
Eli bought it for me.

596
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:51,679
Yeah, but he's coked
out of his mind.

597
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:53,389
To accept a gift from a man
in that condition

598
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,557
is not a good look.

599
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,144
My God. Why are you
acting like this?

600
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,062
I haven't done
anything wrong.

601
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,607
You are taking advantage
of this situation.

602
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,442
You're using Eli.
Just give me the keys.

603
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,611
Stop it.
If anyone is a user,

604
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:09,864
Taylor, it's you. You have been
using me for months.

605
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:13,034
I saved you.
I brought you into my home.

606
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:15,036
You did that for yourself,
not for me.

607
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,080
Your marriage was falling apart
and you needed a distraction.

608
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,374
Eli wasn't writing
or making money,

609
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,584
and you were
so angry

610
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,169
you could barely
even look at him.

611
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:25,588
By the way, I'm the one
who got him writing again.

612
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,007
I did that for you.

613
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,759
You're welcome.

614
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,014
I keep wondering why
Eli started using again.

615
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:40,603
Are you the reason?

616
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,943
(sighs) Oh, my God.
We shouldn't be doing this.

617
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,946
Fighting and throwing blame
at each other.

618
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,614
We're supposed
to be a family.

619
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,616
Stop it. Stop it, Jade!

620
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,284
Eli and I
are a family.

621
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:58,913
You are a houseguest.

622
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:02,166
That's all.

623
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:08,089
You know what, Jade?
Go upstairs,

624
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:12,677
get your stuff.
I want you out of my house now!

625
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,890
That's not gonna happen.

626
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:20,434
You can leave again
if you want,

627
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:23,646
but I'm not going anywhere,

628
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,107
and I'm keeping the car.

629
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,443
I'm not gonna let you
take it away from me.

630
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,409
Tommy, come in.

631
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:05,078
Hi. I have great news.

632
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,914
I returned your brooch
and I got your replacement gift.

633
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,749
Well, it's not
a traditional gift

634
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,544
so much as a tribute to you.

635
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:15,005
I sure hope you like it
because, uh,

636
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:16,923
I can't really return it.
(chuckles)

637
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:21,011
Hey. You look sad. What's wrong?

638
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:23,388
We need to talk.

639
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:28,685
Hey. Hey, great news.

640
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:30,896
Paramount wants to talk to me
about adapting a novel.

641
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,772
I got a meeting on Friday.
I'm telling you,

642
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,900
this comeback shit
is really starting to get real.

643
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:38,153
I'm really,
really happy for you.

644
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,071
What's wrong?

645
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,157
Taylor stopped by.

646
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,368
(sighs) I'm guessing that
didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:46,953
(crying):
Oh, Eli.

648
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,705
I hate this.

649
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:52,083
I hate that she's putting me
in this position.

650
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,377
What position?
What are you talking about?

651
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,796
She wants me to get
the passwords to your accounts,

652
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,840
so she can take away
all your money.

653
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,767
Cancel the trip?

654
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,393
I can't leave
when Karl is sick.

655
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,062
Yeah, but-but he's not
even in the hospital.

656
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,022
Not yet, but this disease
is unpredictable.

657
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:14,981
I need to be here.

658
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:17,234
No, that's not fair.
This was supposed to be

659
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:18,777
the best summer of my life.

660
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,029
And this could be
the last summer of Karl's life,

661
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,031
so please stop sulking.

662
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,827
- What are you doing?
- I need a drink.

663
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:29,079
You're barely 18.

664
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:31,248
Yeah, well, dating
you has aged me.

665
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:33,250
Give me that.

666
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,335
(sighs)

667
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,799
One week, that's all I ask.

668
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,510
Nothing can happen
in-in a-a week.

669
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:47,973
What would be the point?
I wouldn't enjoy myself.

670
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:49,808
In Paris? With me?

671
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:53,645
My husband is dying.

672
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,855
Can you not understand
what that means?

673
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:59,776
So what's gonna happen to us?

674
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:04,030
I don't think
there can be an "us."

675
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,494
Look...

676
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:12,831
I know that I can act
like a kid sometimes,

677
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:15,667
but if you give me another
chance, I can be more mature.

678
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,460
No.

679
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:21,047
You stay young.

680
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:24,342
I'm the one
who needs to grow up.

681
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,177
(phone ringing)

682
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:27,387
That might be
Karl's doctor.

683
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,847
I, I'm gonna take it
in the other room.

684
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,141
- Simone...
- No.

685
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,544
Tommy.

686
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,432
(engine starts)

687
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:17,228
(tires screech)

688
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,233
All right, great,

689
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,903
and you can transfer
those funds today, right?

690
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,739
(sighs) All right, thank you.
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

691
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,741
Bye.

692
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,369
All right. All right,
so my business manager's on it.

693
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:35,288
He's gonna reset the passwords
to all my accounts.

694
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:38,291
And I spoke to Lamar. I forbid
him to speak to Taylor,

695
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,960
so she can't use him to try
to get to my script payments.

696
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:43,088
(sighs)
That's a relief.

697
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,090
Do you think
it'll be enough?

698
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,258
What do you mean?

699
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,761
Taylor was here, in the house,
while we were out.

700
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,596
Maybe we should think
about changing the locks.

701
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,475
Whoa. Uh, I mean,
she's my wife and she loves me.

702
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:57,477
In her way she's just
trying to protect me.

703
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,354
She's trying
to control you.

704
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:03,274
There's a difference.

705
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,068
I don't know.

706
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:07,987
I mean, maybe I should
just call her.

707
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,155
No!

708
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,865
I mean,
I know you want

709
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,784
to believe that
she's gonna come around,

710
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:15,995
but you have to know, deep down,
there's no way she's ever

711
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,581
gonna get on board
with the idea of you using.

712
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,960
And she's threatening
to call your dad.

713
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,837
My dad?
Are you fucking kidding me?

714
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,089
Why?

715
00:34:26,172 --> 00:34:28,758
She knows that I don't speak
to him. Goddamn it.

716
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,135
She can't just fucking do that.

717
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:33,721
She's trying to make
you feel small.

718
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,765
I hate that she's
treating you this way.

719
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:38,017
The last thing I want is
to see you lose everything

720
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:40,979
you've been working
so hard to get.

721
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,148
Who are you calling?

722
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:44,774
Our handyman. You're right.

723
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,901
We're gonna change
those fucking locks.

724
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,907
Rob's got an awful lot
of old sports equipment.

725
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,826
BETH ANN:
And he never uses any of it.

726
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,163
So I'm taking it
to the pawnshop

727
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,331
and giving the cash to April.

728
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,042
Well, that'll be
a nice chunk of change.

729
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,336
It will be easier for her
to make a rational decision

730
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,590
about the baby if she's
not so worried about money.

731
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,718
I still can't believe
you talked her out of it.

732
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:14,637
That horrible place?
I couldn't let her stay.

733
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,306
Here, put this
in the big pile, please.

734
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:20,768
I got to admit
I'm a bit surprised.

735
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,353
Surprised?

736
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,230
She's pregnant
with your husband's kid.

737
00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:25,690
Most wives in that situation

738
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:27,942
wouldn't care how rusty
the knives were.

739
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,195
Couldn't let anything happen
to April or her baby.

740
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:33,198
Honey, y-you know that she could
still decide to get rid of it.

741
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,200
I know. That's why
I have to work hard

742
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,076
over the next few days
to change her mind.

743
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,038
Well, talk to her
about adoption.

744
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,081
You know, there's-there's plenty
of nice people out there

745
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:43,458
who can't have kids.

746
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:47,045
I'll mention that.

747
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,047
There's also
another possibility.

748
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,548
What's that?

749
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,842
Rob and I could raise the baby.

750
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:56,387
What?

751
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,223
I've got it all figured out.

752
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,558
I'll support April
until the baby arrives,

753
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:02,185
then I'll offer to raise it.

754
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:05,188
As far as Rob's concerned,
I could arrange some scenario,

755
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:08,107
finding it in a bassinet
in a park, abandoned.

756
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,109
No one would ever have
to know the truth.

757
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:12,779
Rob would have his child,
April could have her career,

758
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:14,906
everyone would be happy.

759
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,410
What's wrong?

760
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:22,914
At first I thought it was funny,

761
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,750
you becoming friends
with your husband's slut.

762
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,460
- Sheila, that word.
- And then, when you kept getting

763
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:30,838
closer to her, I thought
you were a little nutty.

764
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:34,634
But no. You're sick.

765
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:36,094
I'm not sick.

766
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,930
Your kid is dead.

767
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:42,225
And you're trying to replace her
with April's baby.

768
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:43,268
That is not what I'm doing.

769
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,144
That is what you're doing
from where I'm standing.

770
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,938
You're not allowed to judge me.

771
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,940
Not until
you pick out

772
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,777
Benny's casket
and dress him in his Sunday best

773
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,779
and put him in the ground.

774
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:57,949
Until you do that, I don't
want to hear another word

775
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:00,910
from you.

776
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,547
(door closes)

777
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,428
SIMONE (over phone):
Hello?

778
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,763
Simone, thank God you answered.

779
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,974
Naomi. What's going on?

780
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:24,434
I ran out without my purse,

781
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:26,477
and I don't have
my insurance card or my ID,

782
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:27,645
and the housekeeper
isn't answering,

783
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,105
and I don't have
anyone else to call.

784
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:30,982
Slow down. What's going on?
Where are you?

785
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,442
I'm at the hospital.

786
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:34,777
I need my purse.
Can you please bring it?

787
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,654
Well, of course.
What's happened?

788
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,573
Tommy's been in a car accident.

789
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,659
I-I'll be right there.

790
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:53,988
Yes. Can I help you?

791
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,907
I'm here to speak
to Rob Stanton.

792
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,867
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

793
00:37:57,951 --> 00:37:59,953
But I'm not leaving
until I speak to him.

794
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,496
I beg your pardon?

795
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,998
Tell him it's April.

796
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,292
Oh.

797
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:07,836
So you know who I am.

798
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,879
I do.

799
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:12,799
I'm sorry, but he won't see you.

800
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:14,717
I really think
that you should go.

801
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,643
Miss!

802
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:25,311
Please stop.

803
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:27,981
I'm sorry, Mr. Stanton.

804
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,482
I told her you were busy.

805
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:32,694
It's all right.
What do you want?

806
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,821
One lousy minute
of your time.

807
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:36,865
You owe me that,
don't you think?

808
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,910
Claire, go ahead
and shut the door.

809
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:51,921
I'm sorry I didn't return
your phone calls.

810
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:55,133
I thought a clean break
was just better for...

811
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:56,092
I'm pregnant.

812
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,013
Don't worry.
I don't need anything from you.

813
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,681
I'm not keeping it.

814
00:39:01,764 --> 00:39:03,725
The way you
treated me,

815
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,727
I wasn't even
going to tell you.

816
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,021
But I'm not a bad person.

817
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:10,356
You have a right to know.

818
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,236
Anyway, that's all
I came here to say, so...

819
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,405
goodbye.

820
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,365
Have a nice life.

821
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:21,367
Wait.

822
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,878
Simone, thank you so much.

823
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:34,047
- Where's Tommy?
- They're doing some scans of his head.

824
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,882
He has a possible concussion.

825
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,717
They need to be sure
there's no swelling.

826
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,177
But he'll be all right?

827
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,762
He's pretty banged up.

828
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,389
He has a bad cut on his leg,
but he'll recover.

829
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:45,767
- Oh, thank God.
- He was driving while drunk.

830
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,894
I couldn't believe it
when the nurse told me.

831
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:50,271
Tommy would never...

832
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,775
God. What's happened to my boy?

833
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,402
I feel so awful.

834
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,071
You're so sweet to be here.

835
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:01,115
Even now, when you're going
through your own hell.

836
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,200
What do you mean?

837
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:04,786
I know about Karl,

838
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,621
how he's sick
with that gay disease.

839
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,748
(scoffs) I don't know
what you've heard, but...

840
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:10,959
Ida Coy told me.

841
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,961
She was in one of the stalls

842
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,129
when you were talking
to Dr. Bennett's wife.

843
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,882
Oh, God. Well, please
don't tell anyone else.

844
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:19,467
Karl would be so upset.

845
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,094
I don't care about Karl.

846
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:23,805
You're the one
I'm concerned for.

847
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,640
Are you okay?

848
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,142
Well, I don't have it,
if that's what you're asking.

849
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,978
Well, I hope not.

850
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,856
No one seems to know how
those people are spreading it.

851
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,775
NURSE: We brought
your son to a room

852
00:40:35,858 --> 00:40:37,735
- if you want to see him.
- Yes, please, let's go.

853
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,487
Oh, but we can only allow
family back there.

854
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,447
Oh, Simone is
practically family.

855
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:43,116
Sorry, it's policy.

856
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,117
It's fine.
Just-just

857
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,618
- call me later.
- I will.

858
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:47,996
And I will be there for you
when you need me.

859
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,510
TAYLOR: <i>Truth is,
I fell in love with Jade</i>

860
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,722
<i>without really knowing
who she was.</i>

861
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,686
<i>And what's worse is
I brought her into my home.</i>

862
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,568
<i>Now she's sleeping in my bed
and I'm living in a hotel.</i>

863
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:20,653
<i>I need her out of my house.</i>

864
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,948
<i>But she's enabling
my drug addict husband</i>

865
00:41:24,032 --> 00:41:26,659
<i>and I don't think
he'll just let her go.</i>

866
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:29,871
Not to mention the fact that you
and I both know how intensely

867
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,206
she can react
when she feels threatened.

868
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,836
If I'm gonna get her out of
the house, I need to be smart.

869
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,671
I need leverage.

870
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:41,841
And I thought you might be just
the person to help me with that.

871
00:41:41,925 --> 00:41:43,676
Why would I help you?

872
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,347
I'm thinking, you scratch
my back, I scratch yours.

873
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,724
All you got to do is
tell me where it itches.

874
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,352
They set my bail at $10,000.

875
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:55,521
They seem to think
I'm dangerous.

876
00:41:55,605 --> 00:42:00,318
Well, as luck would have it,
I brought my checkbook.

877
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:06,866
Well, in that case,
how can I help?

878
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:09,077
Tell me everything
you know about Jade.

879
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,872
Well, for starters,
that's not her real name.

880
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:15,917
(exhales):
Oh, shit.

881
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,337
Hold on, darling.
You ain't heard nothing yet.

882
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,094
Oh. Oh, my poor baby.

883
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,014
How is his leg?

884
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:33,017
Well, he needed
some stitches,

885
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:36,437
but he will be good
as new in no time.

886
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,152
What in the world?

887
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,407
NURSE:
Who's Simone?

888
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,033
That his girlfriend?

889
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:52,954
Bit young
for a tattoo.

890
00:42:55,498 --> 00:42:57,500
One day he's gonna
regret that.

891
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:03,047
So will she.

892
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,929
Hey there.

893
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:11,305
How you feeling?

894
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,932
Better,
now that you're here.

895
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:15,435
Aw. Need help with anything?

896
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:18,312
Oh, I'm just peeling potatoes.
I think I can handle it.

897
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,356
I'm gonna change clothes.

898
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,277
When I'm done, I'll come down
and set the table for you.

899
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,446
You're sweet.

900
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,286
(knocking on door)

901
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,454
Leo.

902
00:43:34,537 --> 00:43:35,747
What are you doing here?

903
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,373
Where's Rob?

904
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:39,500
He just went upstairs.
Is something wrong?

905
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,960
Yeah, you need
to come to our house.

906
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:43,129
You got a phone call
from you-know-who.

907
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:45,256
She said
it's important.

908
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,175
Oh.

909
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,844
And Sheila wanted me to tell you

910
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,096
this is the last time
she's doing this for you.

911
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,931
She's still angry with me?

912
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,350
Yeah, something like that.

913
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,484
Do you think I'm
a horrible person?

914
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,695
Nah, I think
you're a nice lady

915
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,240
who's gotten herself
in a real fucking mess.

916
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,085
We're here.

917
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:29,133
Is she serious?

918
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:31,219
Oh, yeah.

919
00:44:34,931 --> 00:44:36,307
Hello?

920
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,059
Sheila. What took you so long?

921
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,144
Long story.
I-Is everything okay?

922
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:43,022
Better than okay.
Everything is wonderful.

923
00:44:43,105 --> 00:44:44,565
- Tell me.
- Well,

924
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:48,069
I went to Rob's office to let
him know that I'm pregnant.

925
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,695
You did what?

926
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:51,864
I figured the S.O.B.
had a right to know.

927
00:44:51,948 --> 00:44:53,866
Anyway, I stormed into
his office and I blurted it out,

928
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,786
and do you know
what that big galoot did?

929
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,037
No.

930
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,539
(laughs):
He got down on one knee

931
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:02,041
and asked me
if I would marry him.

932
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:05,378
But no, but he's still married.

933
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:07,213
That's what I said.

934
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:09,006
But he told me
that his marriage is ending.

935
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,050
He said he just needs
six months.

936
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,554
Six months.

937
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:15,930
And then

938
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,598
he'll be totally free.

939
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,227
Oh.

940
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,354
Anyway, I just wanted
to call to tell you first.

941
00:45:23,437 --> 00:45:25,231
Now I have to call
and tell my mother.

942
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:26,482
(laughs):
Oh, Sheila.

943
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:29,235
I am so happy.

944
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:31,320
(phone clicks)

945
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:43,749
Uh, I would ask if
everything's okay, but, uh,

946
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,919
I don't think I'm allowed
to talk to you anymore.

947
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:49,046
