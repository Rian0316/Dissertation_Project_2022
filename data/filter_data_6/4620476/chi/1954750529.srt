1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:04,614
我去问问你们的沙拉好了没
I'll go check on your salads.

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,833
Oleg 沙拉怎么还没好?
Oleg, what's the hold up with the salads?

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:11,403
我以前从没做过
I never made one before.

4
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:14,528
我最爱的两个人 大Doug和Sancho
My two favorite guys, Big Doug and Sancho,

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,996
他们点的是沙拉?
are ordering salads?

6
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:17,864
他们平时点的BLT呢?
What happened to their usual BLTs?

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:20,567
汉堡 千层面 玉米饼?
Burgers, lasagna, and tacos?

8
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:22,469
他们说想要减肥
They said they want to lose weight.

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,703
不管点什么
And no matter what you order,

10
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:27,140
比起在家吃 在这里更容易吐出来
it's easier to throw up here than at home.

11
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,576
我不懂 为什么大家都想要减肥
I don't get why nobody wants to be fat anymore.

12
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:33,045
奥普拉胖的时候 节目一直是最棒的
The fat seasons of Oprah were always the best.

13
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,916
说得对
You're right.

14
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:40,285
奥普拉不胖的时候也只有一年吧
Every other year of Oprah was the best years.

15
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:45,725
我听说你们两位害羞小可爱要节食?
What is this I hear about you blushing beauties on a diet?

16
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:46,926
哦 我们不是害羞得脸红
Oh, we're not blushing.

17
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:51,831
只是坐下运动过后的脸红
We're just still flushed from sitting down.

18
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:53,299
我们想保持身材
And we're trying to get in shape.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,401
对 身材最好不要像
Yeah, preferably a shape that doesn't resemble

20
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,404
一个季节性的葫芦
a seasonal gourd.

21
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,273
而且 我女朋友想让我瘦下来
Plus my girlfriend wants me to slim down

22
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:03,575
这样我们出行时 就能坐在飞机的同一侧
so we can sit on the same side of the plane when we travel.

23
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:08,915
大Doug
Well, Big Doug,

24
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,285
你告诉那个幸运的女士 我更愿意
you tell that lucky lady that I would rather date a man

25
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:14,253
和胸部大过我的男人约会
with boobs bigger than mine

26
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:17,589
而不愿跟一个自带沙拉酱去餐厅的人约会
than a man who brings his own salad dressing to a restaurant.

27
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,563
给我个派
Pie me.

28
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,431
樱桃 南瓜 还是椰奶馅儿?
Cherry, pumpkin, or coconut cream?

29
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:29,435
全要
Yes.

30
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:30,670

36
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,561
我刚刚聊天的那个人坐在...
I just talked to this guy at...

37
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:56,964
应该是三号桌 我还是记不住桌号
I think it's table three, I still don't know the numbers.

38
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,799
不管怎样 他问了句"有什么新推荐?"
Anyway, he asked, "What's new?"

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,501
我告诉他 我们明天将在机场
And I told him we were opening a dessert bar

40
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,069
开一间甜品店
at the airport tomorrow.

41
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,138
后来我意识到 他问的是
Then I realized he was asking what kind of pot

42
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,575
这周我卖哪种大麻
I was selling this week.

43
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:10,544
你为什么要跟别人聊我们和机场的事?
Why are you telling people about us and the airport?

44
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:14,580
这就像是告诉别人你觉得自己得了人乳突瘤病毒
It's like when you told everyone you thought you had HPV.

45
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:19,719
那算是政府委托的
That was a state-mandated kind of thing.

46
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,056
哦 看这是谁啊...
Oh, look who it is...

47
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,324

the airport people.

48
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,093
你们俩一起度过欢乐时光?
You guys putting together a little happy hour?

49
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,761
和西南部的肌肉男一起?
With the jocks at Southwest?

50
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:31,765
还是和处女终点站的"小圈子"一起?
Or the "in crowd" at the Virgin Terminal?

51
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:36,704
你知道谁会是最后的处子吗?
You know who's going to be a terminal virgin?

52
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,605
你们可以随意做尽各种死亡威胁
You can make all the death threats you want,

53
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:40,407
但你们知道什么会让我活下来吗?
but you know what will keep me alive?

54
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,509
就是你们在机场工作的事实
The fact that you two work at the airport.

55
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,717

Sophie 只剩一周就到婚礼了
Sophie, it's only one week till the wedding,

60
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:08,168
所以这是你投向我怀抱的最后机会
so this is your last chance to take a run at me.

61
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,836
你不会失望的
Now you won't be disappointed.

62
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:12,973
我在前五分钟

哦 但他本来要给你当伴郎的啊
Oh, but he was gonna be your best man.

92
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,929
我都给他留好火腿了
I got a ham engraved for him.

他不一定是最好的 甚至不好都行

你说的是降低 不是低到地下两层
You said lower, not sub-basement.

100
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:07,553

I haven't seen that much change on a lady since Chaz Bono.

116

It's pretty quiet over there these days.

开业日 我太激动了
Opening day, I'm so excited

125
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:10,815
从我醒来开始 我的乳头就一直不安分
my nipples have been shooting daggers since I woke up.

126
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,650
说真的 自从我父母把我送去军校以来
Seriously, I haven't been this excited

127
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:18,022
我还没这么激动过
since my parents sent me to military school.

128
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,959
天啊 你出柜以后 一切不该很有趣吗?

我只是开心 我到前台来了

Finally, I won't be stuffed in the back.

132
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,904

好吧 我来做个演讲吧
Fine, I'll make a speech.

142
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,664
那些说我的口袋太小 永远别想有
To all the school janitors who told me I'd never have

143
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:03,200
自己的巨型钥匙圈的
my own giant set of keys,

144
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:06,070

All right. Here they come.

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,201
或许
Yep.

153
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,436
再等等
Any minute.

154
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:40,571
或许我们点太背了 
Just our luck.

155
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:44,842
赶上今天机场没什么人
The one day the airport isn't crowded.

156
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,910
好吧 我想我可以去男厕
Well, I guess I have time to go check my make-up

157
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,346
补个妆了
in the men's room.

158
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,484
是Han
It's Han.

159
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:56,520
他想让我们今晚去参加Oleg的告别单身派对
He wants us to come to Oleg's bachelor party tonight.

160
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:57,921
之前也接到过这种电话
I've gotten a call like this before,

161
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,690
不过通常都是那种贴了流苏胸片
but usually it's through a service that involves

162
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:05,028
还能两边不同方向甩的舞女打来的
making some tassels spin in opposite directions.

163
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,363
我才不去呢
No way.

164
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:09,266
你知道的 我打算今晚回家痛哭一场
You know I was planning on going home and crying tonight.

165
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,801
这可是Han策划的派对
Han is planning a party.

166
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:13,870
肯定能让你哭出来的
You will cry there for sure.

167
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,073
这倒没错 我现在在哪都能哭出来
That's true. I really can cry anywhere now.

168
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,776
我想这点我还是能做到的
I guess I've got that at least.

169
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:23,747
我简直不敢相信我会在机场工作 Max
I can't believe I work at the airport, Max.

170
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:27,049
嘿 要是我把钥匙圈给你 你会不会好受点?
Hey, would you feel better if you held my giant keys?

171
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:34,457
你好?
Hello?

172
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,493
你好
Hello.

173
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:38,795
欢迎光临 你是我们的第一位顾客
Welcome, you're our first customer.

174
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:41,031
那有什么奖励吗?
Do I get a prize?

175
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,698
奖品就是你吗?
Is it you?

176
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:48,570
我上道了 我爱上这份工作了
I'm on board now. I love this job.

177
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,313
大家晚上好
Welcome, everyone.

178
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,782
我是今晚的主持人Han Lee
I'm your M.C., Han Lee,

179
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,917
请允许我以几个风趣幽默的色情笑话
gonna get the crazy party started here

180
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,854
拉开疯狂派对的帷幕
with some dirty, racy jokes.

181
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,323
这是我到过的最死气沉沉的地方
This is the deadest place I've ever been to,

182
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:12,727
比天堂都死气沉沉
and I once woke up in Heaven.

183
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,929
好 那我们开始吧
Okay, here we go.

184
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,067
魔方和阴茎的共同点是什么?
What do a Rubik's Cube and a penis have in common?

185
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,369
越玩越硬(难)
The more you play with it, the harder it gets.

186
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:29,444
魔方是上世纪八十年代一种非常流行的玩具
A Rubik's Cube was a popular '80s toy.

187
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,980
弱爆了! 下一个
You suck! Next act.

188
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:39,187
海象和特百惠(塑料产品品牌)有什么共同点?
What do a walrus and a Tupperware have in common?

189
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,455
等一下
Hold on a minute.

190
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:44,959
是和密封条有关的...
Something about a seal being tight...

191
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:47,829
噢!
Oh!

192
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,565
那个飞行员Josh给我发短信了
I just got a text from Josh, the pilot.

193
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,266
他说 "嘿 你在干嘛?"
He says, "What's up, you?"

194
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,435
是不是很可爱?
Isn't that cute?

195
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:59,106
忘了你的名字很可爱?
Cute that he forgot your name?

196
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:02,710
你是不是真的很久没恋爱过了?
It's really been a long time for you, hasn't it?

197
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:08,215
我上周脱了内裤 结果一匹狼嚎叫了起来
I took off my underwear last week and a coyote howled.

198
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,250
太棘手了
Tough crowd.

199
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:12,720
我是说你 Max
I'm talking about you, Max.

200
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,288
拜托 Han 放轻松
Oh come on, Han. Loosen up.

201
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,356
来 喝一杯
Have a drink.

202
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:21,028
马提尼 苹果马提尼 随便什么提尼(同"小"的英文发音相同)
A martini, an appletini, anything teeny.

203
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,696
别了 还是来一杯伏特加吧
Nah, just do a vodka shot.

204
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:25,499
要是没有参照物 伏特加的小酒杯在你手上就和正常酒杯一个大小
If nothing else, the glass will look normal-sized in your hand

205
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,634
我照样能笑
and I'll have a laugh.

206
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,405
伤不了我
Can't hurt.

207
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,408
不过这酒确实挺烈的
But it did.

208
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,143
谢谢你能来帮我主持派对 Han 
Thanks for the party, Han.

209
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:39,313
不过派对什么时候开始啊?
What time is it starting?

210
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,814
我从来没当过伴郎
I've never been a best man.

211
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,517
压力山大啊
It's a lot of pressure.

212
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,285
没错 做一个男人对你来说就挺不容易的
Yeah, being a man would be hard for you.

213
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:48,255
你还是个小男生呢
You've never been one before.

214
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:51,657
更别说当伴郎了
Let alone the best one.

215
00:10:55,295 --> 00:11:01,101
这里面都是什么 毛玻璃片吗?
What's in that, ground glass?

216
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:04,137
呃 这个派对还不如共产党呢
Ugh, this party is worse than the communist party.

217
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:08,842
共产党可是杀了我一半的家人
And they killed half my family.

218
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,411
Oleg 别担心 我来让大家嗨起来
Oleg, don't worry, I'll get this party started.

219
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:14,014
我打电话把和我一起上学的妹子叫来
I'm making a call to some girls I went to school with.

220
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:17,084
我们学校号称是第七街的荡妇学院
The Slut Academy on Seventh.

221
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,754
简称NYU(同纽约大学的简称)
Commonly known as NYU.

222
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,656
我更担心我的堂哥
I'm more concerned about my cousin.

223
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,725
我让他帮我带一些重要的东西
He has something I need.

224
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,495
肥皂? 除臭剂? 还是药效最强的牛皮癣喷雾?
Soap? Deodorant? The toughest actin' Tinactin?

225
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:31,064
噢 他来了!
Oh, there he is!

226
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,899
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

227
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,368
木嘛 木嘛
Mwah, mwah.

228
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:38,638
好吧 看来不是除臭剂
Well, he didn't bring the deodorant.

229
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,007
Yuri 你赶来了
Yuri, you made it.

230
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,276
你是脱衣舞女吗?
Are you the stripper?

231
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:46,613
可能几年后就是了
Probably in a few years.

232
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:47,914
你把文件带来了吗?
Did you bring the papers?

233
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,849
我结婚要用的文件?
The papers I need to get married?

234
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,118
还有我喜欢的乌克兰糖果?
And those little Ukrainian candies I love?

235
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,253
坏消息
Bad news.

236
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,588
那个伪造文件的家伙被驱逐出境了
The guy who made the fake papers got deported.

237
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,956
他们没收了文件
They took the papers.

238
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:59,259
糖果也被我吃了
I ate the candy.

239
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,193
我错过了什么?
What'd I miss?

240
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:03,463
除了我成名的机会
Besides my chance to become something?

241
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,665
你是脱衣舞女吗?
Are you the stripper?

242
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,134
不是
Nyet.

243
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:12,972
褒贬全都涵盖在一个词里了
A compliment and an insult in just one word.

244
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,507
噢 不
Oh, no.

245
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:17,410
噢 不 不 不
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

246
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,279
我说了"不" 吗?
Did I mention "no"?

247
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,647
你这不是知道"不"的含义吗 
How can you say the word "no"

248
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:25,351
为什么女人说"不"的时候 你却听不懂?
but not understand it when women say it?

249
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,853
简直是晴天霹雳
This is a disaster.

250
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:30,256
重点是我还没机会浑水摸鱼
And not the kind where I can loot.

251
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:33,492
我需要这些假文件来给假绿卡续期
I needed those fake papers to renew my fake green card.

252
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,428
我的绿卡下个月就要到期了
Mine expires next month.

253
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,797
什么时候你开始在意保质期了?
Since when do you care about expiration dates?

254
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,767
你煮的那些蛋 老得都能孵出来小鸡跟你打架了
You cook with eggs so old they fight back.

255
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,003
Sophie一定不会相信 我不是为了绿卡
Sophie will never believe that I'm not marrying her

256
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:45,638
才跟她结婚的
just for a green card.

257
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,106
她很难信任别人
She has major trust issues

258
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:50,242
因为有一天 她父亲说出去买煎饺...
since one day, her father went out for pierogies and...

259
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:54,279
可是却空手而归
came back without pierogies.

260
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:06,747
我还挺喜欢这种展现了
I'm really enjoying the dance stylings

261
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:10,451
女性下身魅力的舞蹈服装
of Camel and Toe up there.

262
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,087
除了Oleg 大家都很嗨嘛
Everyone is having fun except Oleg.

263
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:15,156
我还没看见他在这些妹子面前 
I haven't seen him so much as put the "V" fingers

264
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:18,926
举手在嘴边比V的手势
in front of his mouth at any of these ladies.

265
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,228
哦!
Ooh!

266
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:24,964
我不介意跟这个妞来点出汗的运动
Wouldn't mind some over the sweater action with her.

267
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,269
她的还是你的?
Hers or yours?

268
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,609
Max 我刚做了件我从没做过的事
Max, I just did something I've never done.

269
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,513
讲了个关于别人的故事?
Told a story about someone else?

270
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,216
不 我给那飞行员发了一张裸胸照
No, I sent the pilot a boob pic.

271
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:46,854
姑娘 你可真下流
Girl, you nasty.

272
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,957
我知道 我好下流!
I know. I am nasty!

273
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,761
我裸着胸看着镜头 就点了发送
I just looked into the camera with my boobs out and hit send.

274
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,429
啊哈 太棒了
Ah-ha, that's awesome.

275
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,965
回到刚才那句
Uh, circling back now,

276
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,401
你说你看着镜头来着?
did you say you looked into the camera?

277
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,803
你没把脸照进去 对吧?
You didn't put your face in it, did you?

278
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,238
姑娘!
Girl!

279
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,207
你可真傻
You stupid.

280
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,343
不这样他怎么知道是我?
How else would he know it was me?

281
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,578
永远不要把脸照进去
You never put your face in it.

282
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,082
我平常都怎么教的你?
Didn't I raise you better than this?

283
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:20,087
算了 至少你没笑
Well, at least you weren't smiling in it.

284
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,955
好吧 什么样的笑?
All right, what kind of smile?

285
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:23,357
轻浮的假笑是可以的
A flirty smirk could work.

286
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:26,193
那种轻佻诱惑的笑更棒
A come-hither grin would be great.

287
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:29,462
更像是...
More like...

288
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,038
所以你刚刚... 这样
So you were in this... pose

289
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,875
还露着奶子?
with your yabbos out?

290
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:47,214
也就是说 你刚拍了个裸体酸奶广告
So you basically did a nude yogurt ad.

291
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:50,616
没错 不过是那种你想上的酸奶 对吧?
Yeah, but like yogurt you want to have sex with, right?

292
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,422
天啊
Oh, my God.

293
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:57,290
Sophie马上就到了
Sophie will be here any minute.

294
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,359
我打电话时 她在洗头发
When I called, she was washing her hair.

295
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,396
正要把它黏回头上 出门过来
She was going to put it back on her head and come.

296
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:05,231
跟她讲实话就好
Just be honest with her.

297
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:07,066
有时候真相是丑陋的
Sometimes the truth is ugly.

298
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:10,203
她肯定明白 她都看过你裸体了
But she knows that. She's seen you naked.

299
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:13,672
他还没回短信 肯定不能比这个再丑陋了
Well, still no text back so apparently not as ugly as this.

300
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:17,377
那是什么意思?
What's that about?

301
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:22,048
你改做推销房地产的生意了?
Are you selling real estate now?

302
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,689
哇哦
Oh, wow.

303
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,558
这个派对不能更下流俗气了
I mean, this party couldn't get any sleazier

304
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,295
除非你请来罗宾・西克(创作型歌手)
unless you invited Robin Thicke.

305
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,297
这就是一个放荡卖淫城
I'm looking up at skanky whore city,

306
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:41,467
但我信任你 Oleg
but I trust you, Oleg.

307
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,735
真的?
You do?

308
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,570
真的 为什么不呢?
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

309
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,039
尽管我过去遇到过
Aside from my complicated past

310
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,043
无数个对我撒谎的男人
full of men that have lied to me.

311
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:54,080
但你我之间没有任何秘密 对吧 Oleg?
But you and I don't have secrets from each other, right, Oleg?

312
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,481
是这样的 听着...
Yeah, well, you see...

313
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:59,352
现在该伴郎致辞了
It is time for the traditional best man speech.

314
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:03,221
听好了 婊子们
So listen up, bitches.

315
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:12,498
该死
Ow, damn it.

316
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:15,868
我在流血
I am bleeding.

317
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,604
重复 我在流血
Repeat, I am bleeding.

318
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,939
简直不敢相信
I can't believe this.

319
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,807
现在有一摇手机它就能打嗝的软件
There's an app that burps when you shake your phone,

320
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:25,878
但没有软件能撤回裸胸照?
but no app that unsends a boob pic?

321
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,448
Sophie 还有Oleg
Sophie. Oleg.

322
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:32,718
关于这两个孩子我能讲点什么呢?
What's there to say about these two kids?

323
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:35,220
Oleg是个烂厨子
Oleg is a bad cook.

324
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,856
Sophie挺吵闹的
Sophie, quite loud.

325
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:41,593
但不知为何 他俩在一起时 有奇妙的魅力
But somehow, when they get together, magic.

326
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,797
弱爆了 下一个!
You suck, next act!

327
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:48,767
在机场工作的小姐如是说
Says the lady that works at the airport.

328
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:52,037
Oleg 我非常高兴Sophie要嫁给你了
And, Oleg, I'm so glad Sophie is marrying you

329
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,706
这样你就能留在美国了
so now you can stay in the country.

330
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,375
哦 不...
Oh, no. Uh...

331
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,978
弱爆了 下一个?
You suck. Next act?

332
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,748
我懂你 姑娘
Yeah, I hear ya girl.

333
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:06,151
最后一句话都没有笑点
I mean that last joke didn't even have a punch line.

334
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:10,856
还有点小悲伤
Yeah, I mean, it was sort of sad.

335
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,290
那不是开玩笑
It was no joke.

336
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,658
是严肃的
This is serious.

337
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,626
这问题真的很严肃
It's really serious.

338
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,294
那张裸胸照已经在云端了
That boob pic is up in the Cloud now.

339
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:20,264
我的胸在云端了 伙计们
My boob is in the Cloud, y'all.

340
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:26,371
Sophie 我不知道该怎样告诉你
Sophie, I didn't know how to tell you.

341
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:30,842
你跟我结婚是为了绿卡?
You wanted to marry me for a green card?

342
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:34,346
我以为你是因为我的好身材
See, I thought you were marrying me for my bod.

343
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:39,718
或是因为我在收纳连锁店的人脉 或是...
Or for my connections at The Container Store, or...

344
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:45,090
我可是教了你识字的!
I mean, I taught you how to read!

345
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,091
Sophie 听我解释
Sophie, I can explain.

346
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,927
不 不 婚礼取消了
No, no, no. The wedding's off.

347
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,361
不
Oh, no.

348
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,131
那群被我涂成新娘白的鸽子
What the hell am I going to do with all those pigeons

349
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:56,601
该怎么办呢?
that I had painted wedding white?

350
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:57,902
Sophie 等等
Sophie, wait.

351
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:13,651
哦 看看这是谁
Aww, well, look who it is.

352
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:17,655
要被驱逐出境的小亲亲
My dearly deported.

353
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:21,759
我刚刚一路上都在想这句话
I worked on that the whole way over.

354
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,462
Sophie 我不会被驱逐的
Sophie, I'm not gonna be deported.

355
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:27,031
我要娶个人 来留在美国
I'm gonna marry someone so I can stay in this country

356
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,833
然后赢回你的心
and win you back.

357
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:32,502
我不在乎我的新娘是谁
I don't care who my new bride is.

358
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,142
先说好了 不可能是我
Just upfront, it can't be me.

359
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:41,978
因为所有人都知道我已经嫁给我的事业了
'Cause everybody knows I'm married to my work.

360
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,751
也不能是我
And it can't be me.

361
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,320
就是不能
It just can't.

362
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:52,123
她们不一定是最好的 甚至不好都行
They don't even have to be the best or even good.

363
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:55,959
我已经没要求了
Standards are out the window.

364
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,964
看啊 加州葡萄干来了
Look, it's a California Raisin.

365
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:07,538
墨镜和布洛芬
Ooh. Sunglasses and Advil.

366
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,774
昨晚真是太疯狂了
Last night was mad real.

367
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,976
嘿 Han
Han,

368
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:15,746
为了我能留在美国 你愿意跟我结婚吗?
will you marry me so I can stay in the country?

369
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,414
我得考虑考虑
I'll need to think about it.

370
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:20,517
我愿意
Yes.

371
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:24,655
很明显 他唯一不同意的就只有医保
Apparently the only thing he won't say yes to is health care.

372
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:27,991
Oleg 我不相信你
Oleg, I don't believe you.

373
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,227
这只是另一个小伎俩 来诱惑我
This is just another trick to get me to do

374
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,196
做你想让我做的事情
what you want me to do.

375
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:37,868
就像那次你总把冰淇淋"掉"到大腿上一样
Like when you kept "dropping" your ice cream into your lap.

376
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,236
不是伎俩
No trick.

377
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:43,140
有时 爱会让你做疯狂又恶心的事
Sometimes love makes you do crazy, disgusting things.

378
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,107
像这样
Like this.

379
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:47,443
过来 Han
Come here, Han.

380
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,920
我现在也爱上这份工作了!
And now I love this job, too!

381
00:19:56,921 --> 00:20:01,792
谢天谢地他选了Han
Thank God he picked Han.

382
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,928
Sophie 听着 Oleg一定很爱你
Wow, Sophie. Oleg must really love you.

383
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,130
那对他来说一定很难
That had to be hard for him.

384
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:10,466
也能看得出来 Han也有点硬了(难)
And from what I can see, a little hard for Han, too.

385
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:19,175
咱俩的婚礼上 记得喷两次口气清新剂
At our wedding, maybe two pumps of breath spray.

386
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,480
Han 你不能跟Oleg结婚
Han, you're not marrying Oleg.

387
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:28,651
因为他要娶的是我
'Cause Oleg's marrying me.

388
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,421
我相信你了
I believe you now.

389
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:33,356
因为你亲了Han
'Cause you kissed Han,

390
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,426
而你从不喜欢亚洲女生
and Asian girls aren't even your thing.

391
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,103
天啊 Max 是我的裸胸照
Oh my God, Max, it's my boob pic.

392
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:51,140
有人用它做了个迷因
Someone made it into a meme.

393
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:54,410
大咪咪迷因?
A mammo meme?

394
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:57,914
你到四十岁前是不会需要这个的
You're not supposed to need those 'til you're 40.

395
00:20:57,915 --> 00:21:01,317
我的裸胸照片会缠着我一辈子的!
My boob pic is gonna be hanging over me for the rest of my life.

396
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:02,485
算了吧
Oh, come on,

397
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:05,720
你的胸连根铅笔都缠不住
your boob couldn't hang over a pencil.
