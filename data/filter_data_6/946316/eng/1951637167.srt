1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:04,088
<i>Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.</i>

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:06,619
<i>Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing</i>

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:09,668
<i>can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.</i>

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:12,287
<i>Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.</i>

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,803
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,896
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,975
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,774
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,135
<i>Why was this flight
so important?</i>

10
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.</i>

11
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,888
<i>I had just sold my first
building design and become</i>

12
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,683
<i>the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.</i>

13
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,914
<i>Suddenly I was
being headhunted.</i>

14
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,490
<i>One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.</i>

15
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:42,701
<i>They were flying me in
for a final interview
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.</i>

16
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.</i>

17
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:47,832
<i>It was my destiny.
There was just one problem.</i>

18
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,860
Hi, wait, two more.

19
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,802
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

20
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,061
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

21
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:57,000
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

22
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,162
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

23
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,033
Except for that guy.

24
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,492
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

25
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:07,621
I'm sorry, sir.

26
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,530
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

27
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:13,163
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

28
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:17,441
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night
dreaming about being a...

29
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,511
I mean, uh...

30
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,722
This is a cool job.

31
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,220
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

32
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:27,012
I'll see what I can do.
But it doesn't look good.

33
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:28,620
Thanks.

34
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,763
Your uniforms are pretty.

35
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:38,678
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER
сезон 2, епизод 15
Късметлийката Пени

36
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:41,990
превод: TabE
http//subs.sab.bz

37
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,281
Okay.

38
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:51,753
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

39
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:54,123
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

40
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:56,323
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

41
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,560
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

42
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,181
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

43
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:03,131
not, you know,
one minute after.

44
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:05,112
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

45
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:07,140
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

46
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,703
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

47
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:11,731
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

48
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:15,022
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

49
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:17,912
Hello?

50
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,743
Oh, that is great news.

51
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,842
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

52
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:26,952
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

53
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,943
Where was it?

54
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,953
That thing better
have call waiting.

55
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:33,332
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

56
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:36,841
It's down to three people
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

57
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:40,232
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

58
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:43,111
I'm so stupid.

59
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,223
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

60
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,923
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

61
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,800
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

62
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:54,070
<i>She had a point.
It was kind of Barney's fault.</i>

63
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:56,362
<i>Let's back up a few months.</i>

64
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,471
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

65
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,670
Oh, man, it kills.
You  want some aspirin, baby?

66
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,293
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

67
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,161
Wow, your first broken bone.

68
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,062
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

69
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:12,773
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

70
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,251
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

71
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,511
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

72
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,612
I can summon
incredible strength.

73
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:22,190
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

74
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,473
There was a really heavy door.
He opened it.

75
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,652
On one pull.

76
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,172
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

77
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,580
Yeah. It sucks,

78
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:36,960
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

79
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,972
Training for a marathon.

80
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,392
What?

81
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:44,232
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

82
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:46,021
You're kidding, right?

83
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,792
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

84
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,942
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

85
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,710
and just run the New
York City Marathon?
Absolutely.

86
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:57,771
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

87
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:00,231
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

88
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,381
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

89
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,322
Here's how you run a marathon.

90
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,590
Step one, you start running.

91
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,090
There is no step two.

92
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,773
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

93
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:13,771
Take my number and
run in my place.

94
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:17,170
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

95
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,523
50 bucks?

96
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:22,963
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

97
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,593
Make it $10,000.

98
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,952
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

99
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,912
Fine, then no bet.
Okay, $50.

100
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,680
<i>The next morning,
as the marathon began,</i>

101
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,881
<i>we were focused on
Marshall's computer.</i>

102
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:40,452
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

103
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:43,462
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

104
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:47,680
Ooh, he's starting!
This ought to be good.

105
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,900
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

106
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,313
This tracking thing is amazing.

107
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,172
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

108
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:10,443
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

109
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,770
He's gotta be cheating, okay.
He knew we'd check.

110
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:15,390
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

111
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,851
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

112
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,460
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

113
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,900
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

114
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,153
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

115
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,702
there is no way that
that's really him.

116
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,900
It's really him.

117
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,800
Hey! That's mine.

118
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:44,010
Yeah, you'd better run!

119
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:50,142
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

120
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,442
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

121
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

122
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:57,272
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

123
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:59,840
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

124
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,743
I  won.

125
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,630
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

126
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:08,000
So where's my 50 bucks?

127
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,990
All right.

128
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:13,192
I got to admit,
you earned this.

129
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:17,990
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

130
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,943
Anyway, I'm heading home.
Might go hit the gym.

131
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,570
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get
to use the subway
for free today.

132
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,943
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

133
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:33,691
Heard so much about it.
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

134
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:36,552
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

135
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:39,043
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

136
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:41,142
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

137
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,983
No.

138
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,172
<i>So Barney did it.
He actually finished
the marathon.</i>

139
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:52,622
<i>But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.</i>

140
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:54,331
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

141
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,762
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

142
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,500
What, what are
you talking about?

143
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,413
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

144
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:03,609
преди два часа

145
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,600
Finisher.

146
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,031
Yeah, you know what I mean.

147
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,130
86th street.

148
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,883
My legs don't work.

149
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,910
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

150
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,001
I've seen where
it turns around.

151
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,791
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

152
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,101
Barney's legs won't work.

153
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:53,890
He's riding the subway
from end to end
because he physically
can't get off the train.

154
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,083
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

155
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,341
Listen to me, Ted.

156
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:00,341
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

157
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,663
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

158
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,580
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

159
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,702
All right. I'll be right there.

160
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:09,662
Stay where you are.

161
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,493
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

162
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,642
I'm sorry. I can't.

163
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,592
Douche.

164
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,098
25 минути по-късно

165
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,233
- Barney?!
- Ted!

166
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:06,490
No...!

167
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:10,380
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

168
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:12,130
you  never would have
jumped that turnstile,

169
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:15,883
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,
and we would have
made this flight.

170
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:19,042
You're right.
Everything can be
traced back to him.

171
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,982
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

172
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,011
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

173
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:28,720
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

174
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,592
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

175
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,403
Ma, can I call you back?

176
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,493
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

177
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,591
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

178
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,762
Looks like your
flight left already.

179
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,390
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

180
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,120
Well, he never even
called you back?

181
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,522
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

182
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,220
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

183
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,240
at a Radisson in Orlando.

184
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:58,620
<i>It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me</i>

185
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,500
<i>to Chicago on time
for my job interview,</i>

186
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:03,503
<i>but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.</i>

187
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,431
What was the name of
the airline again?

188
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,291
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

189
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,753
Was the "R" backwards?
God, I hope not.

190
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,181
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

191
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,522
More  like dumb carts.

192
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,933
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

193
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,361
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

194
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,670
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

195
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,991
What, you think
this is my fault?

196
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:31,330
<i>For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.</i>

197
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,371
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

198
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:36,970
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

199
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,671
I cannot allow this.

200
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,472
What?

201
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:50,183
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

202
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,793
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

203
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:05,751
two to four hours
before a big run.

204
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,031
Try  a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

205
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:11,102
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

206
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,850
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

207
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:17,683
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

208
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:19,610
Liquids are digested faster.

209
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,691
That way, no energy is wasted,

210
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,291
and it's all about the run.

211
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:58,433
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

212
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,773
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

213
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:06,043
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

214
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:09,533
You are a robot sent
from the future

215
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,553
to win the marathon!

216
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,603
You are... Marshall.

217
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:19,393
You are... Marshall.

218
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:23,603
You are Marshall! Yeah!

219
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:32,851
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

220
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:36,481
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

221
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:40,402
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

222
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:02,171
Oh, gosh!

223
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,181
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

224
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:24,151
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

225
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,890
You're the best.

226
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:29,140
You look good.

227
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,340
Nobody does it better than you.

228
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,392
Marshall? Oh, my God!

229
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,620
So, yes, it was your fault.

230
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,902
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

231
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,590
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

232
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,660
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

233
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,723
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

234
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,601
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

235
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,690
That really wasn't my fault.

236
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,951
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

237
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,862
Hey, think about it.

238
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:01,421
Hey, what's going on here?
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

239
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:02,751
Yeah, but for what?

240
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,592
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

241
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,551
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

242
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:12,721
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

243
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,791
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

244
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,930
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

245
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,090
We have to camp out.

246
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,973
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

247
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:25,390
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

248
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,392
but I never knew where it was.

249
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,000
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

250
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:33,472
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

251
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,660
- What thing?
- A penis.

252
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,770
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

253
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:42,261
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

254
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,741
Vera Wang!

255
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:47,822
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

256
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,683
You said wang.

257
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:55,991
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

258
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,801
Only fewer mullets.

259
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:02,593
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

260
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,533
Ooh, this is comfy.

261
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:10,001
We might actually
be able to sleep.

262
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,101
That's kind of annoying.

263
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:17,371
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

264
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:23,748
5 часа по-късно

265
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,012
I don't think I can take this.

266
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:37,471
Every time it turns off,
I think,
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

267
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:39,702
but then it does.

268
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:43,421
Why does it, Robin?
Why does it keep turning on?

269
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,471
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

270
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,251
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

271
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,220
Why don't we sing along?

272
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:07,347
3 часа по-късно

273
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,550
If we get through this,

274
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,031
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

275
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:20,341
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

276
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,641
Morning, ladies.

277
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,602
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

278
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:41,243
<i>The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,</i>

279
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:43,071
<i>so while I was at work,</i>

280
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,551
<i>she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,</i>

281
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,472
<i>and that's when...</i>

282
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,951
Nobody does it better than you.

283
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:52,013
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

284
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:56,173
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

285
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,881
we would have made
the first flight.

286
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:00,570
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

287
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:04,681
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

288
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:06,751
Oh, my God!

289
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:09,183
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

290
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,822
Yes, yes, I am.

291
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,922
I can't believe
you recognized me.

292
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,630
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

293
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:17,763
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

294
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,643
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

295
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:22,882
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

296
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:24,960
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

297
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,290
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

298
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:30,370
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

299
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:33,371
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

300
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:36,400
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

301
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,401
two seats on that next flight.

302
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:42,961
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

303
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:45,203
Let me see what I can find out.

304
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:47,933
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

305
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,973
I think it might hurt.

306
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:54,893
This is such a nightmare.

307
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:59,032
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

308
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,030
for a wedding dress?

309
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:04,152
No.
Wait. It goes back further.

310
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,102
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

311
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,731
1939?!

312
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,792
This penny's from 1939!

313
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:27,580
A 67-year-old penny.

314
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,511
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

315
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,840
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

316
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,451
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

317
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:38,690
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

318
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,841
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

319
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:45,083
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner
with the money I get
for this little guy.

320
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,352
<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>

321
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,971
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

322
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:54,040
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

323
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:57,591
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

324
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,112
1984.

325
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,920
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

326
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,882
How dare you.

327
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:06,792
Hey, what's going on?

328
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,383
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

329
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,883
Yeah, but for what?

330
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:11,912
It was me.

331
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,012
I started this.

332
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,742
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

333
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,520
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

334
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,980
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

335
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,941
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

336
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:26,161
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

337
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,422
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

338
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:30,582
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

339
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:32,603
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

340
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:35,122
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

341
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,300
And we would have
made our flight.

342
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,881
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

343
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,032
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

344
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,060
I wish I did.

345
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,163
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

346
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,663
losing a sweet penny like that.

347
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,251
Oh,  please tell me you
have some good news.

348
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,063
Uh, I'm afraid not.

349
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:57,430
There are no extra
seats on the plane.
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,502
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

351
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:03,811
I can't believe this.
That's it, it's over.

352
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,632
Ted, come on.

353
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:09,023
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

354
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,970
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

355
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:15,652
<i>But that's not what happened.
They didn't reschedule.</i>

356
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,532
<i>They hired someone else.</i>

357
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,081
<i>And as it turned out,
three months later,</i>

358
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:23,372
<i>that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.</i>

359
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:25,761
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

360
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:28,241
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

361
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:29,772
But I was wrong.

362
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:32,151
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

363
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,410
Because if I hadn't,

364
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,570
I never would have
met your mother.

365
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:05,591
