00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,730
-關燈  拜托  -放輕松
- The lights, please. - Just relax.

174
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,740
請你保持冷靜  查爾斯
Please stay calm, Charles.

175
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,930
查爾斯  你得配合我們
Charles, you need to cooperate with us.

176
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,260
這非常簡單的
This is gonna be very easy.

177
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,340
我們只需要抽一點點血
We're just gonna draw a little bit of blood,

178
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,720
縫合你的傷口  做個簡單的斷層掃描
suture up your wound, and do a very simple CAT scan.

179
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,390
-不  不能做掃描  -冷靜  冷靜
- No! No CAT scan! - Okay, c-calm, calm.

180
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,610
-不能做掃描  -特莉莎
- No CAT scan! - Tricia,

181
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,300
請將他固定
can we please get some restraints?

182
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,990
-你不明白  -男醫生麻煩進來
- You don't understand! - Gentlemen, please come in here.

183
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,890
求求你  把燈關掉
Please, turn off the lights.

184
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,790
要把他固定住
You have to hold him down, restrain him.

185
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,000
-請把燈關掉  -查爾斯
- Please turn off the lights! - Charles...

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,710
-這邊  -你得冷靜
- Right here. - ...we need you to calm down.

187
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,200
-你這是在謀殺我  -冷靜  查爾斯
- You're killing me! - Calm down, Charles.

188
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,710
-檢查了就沒事了  -你沒事的
- Just gonna get them and figure it out for you. - You're fine.

189
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,310
有我們在呢
We got you.

190
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,820
頭別抬起來
Just keep your head down.

191
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,530
他情況如何
How's he doing?

192
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,520
我也想告訴你
I'd love to be able to tell you,

193
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,350
但是不做檢查沒辦法確定
but we can't know for sure until we do those tests.

194
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,450
你知道我要說什么
You know what I'm gonna say.

195
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,360
你們為什么不能用傳統方法
Why can't you just go old-school -- you know,

196
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,540
檢查眼球  用聽診器之類的
look at his pupils, use a stethoscope -- that kinda thing?

197
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,740
他不想待在這里
He doesn't want to be here.

198
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,300
他想要什么和他需要什么
What he wants and what he needs

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,280
完全是兩碼事  吉米
are two very different things, Jimmy.

200
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,860
我們不知道他失去意識
We don't know if he lost consciousness

201
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,460
是心臟問題還是輕微中風引起的
because of a heart-related issue or if it was a mild stroke.

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
我們不知道他脊椎是否受傷
We don't know if his spine has been injured,

203
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,630
腦部是否腫脹
if his brain is swelling.

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,050
至少很有可能腦震蕩
He likely has a concussion, at least.

205
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,750
查克還是拒絕做檢查
Chuck is once again refusing these tests

206
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,210
因為會讓他受到"電磁轟炸"
because they involve being bombarded by electricity --

207
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,540
這是他的原話
his words.

208
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,060
跟他上次進醫院一模一樣
Nothing has changed since the last time he was in here.

209
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,620
我已經解釋得很清楚了
Look, I don't know ‭how to explain this any clearer.

210
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,020
我不會讓他住院的
I'm not committing him.

211
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,080
那申請臨時緊急監護人如何
What about a Temporary Emergency Guardianship?

212
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,170
他符合條件
I mean, he fits the parameters.

213
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,160
你跟我說他急需醫療
You're telling me he's in need of medical care so urgent

214
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,110
沒辦法等到法庭完成審核程序
that we can't wait around on court procedure.

215
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,180
沒錯
Most certainly.

216
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,340
而且查克無法理解后果
Yeah. And Chuck is not able to understand the consequences.

217
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,360
他是可以理解  但是他...
I mean, he can ‭understand them, but he --

218
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,330
沒錯
Absolutely.

219
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,710
法官也會這么理解的
A judge will see it that way, too.

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
之后我帶他回家就可以了
And then I take him home, and it's over.

221
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,710
等待檢驗結果和適當治療  可以
Pending results and proper treatment, yes.

222
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,680
我認識個法官  現在就可以聯系他
I know a judge we can call right now.

223
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,600
讓我來告訴他吧
Let me be the one to tell him.

224
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,610
老兄  你還好嗎
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

225
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
查克
Chuck.

226
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,220
你簡直是隨時待命
Well, if it isn't Johnny-on-the-spot.

227
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,230
什么意思
What? What does that mean?

228
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,640
歐內斯托在外面嗎
Is Ernesto out there?

229
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,110
對  你需要什么嗎
Yeah. Can I get you something?

230
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,310
歐內斯托
Ernesto!

231
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,410
麻煩你進來
Come in here, please!

232
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,700
放松
Look, just take it easy.

233
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,120
歐內斯托
Ernesto!

234
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,950
把你東西放那兒
Just put your stuff in there.

235
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,480
我把他叫來了
I got him.

236
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,090
你感覺怎么樣  麥吉爾先生
How are you feelin', Mr. McGill?

237
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,290
歐內斯托  我在那家復件店里
Ernesto, ‭how long was I unconscious

238
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,460
昏迷了多久
in that print shop?

239
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,830
我不確定
I'm not sure.

240
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,810
三十秒  一分鐘
30 seconds, a minute?

241
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,140
-還是兩分鐘  -大概有一分鐘吧
- 2 minutes? - ‭I'd say maybe about a minute.

242
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,210
你時而清醒時而迷糊
You were kinda in and out.

243
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,820
救護車來之前
And how long was I lying on the floor

244
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,640
我在地上躺了多久
before the ambulance arrived?

245
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,530
大概有十分鐘吧  我沒看表
About 10 minutes, I think, but I didn't look at the clock.

246
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,100
而那時你已經到了
And yet, you were there.

247
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,880
查克  我們能不能...
Chuck, can we, uh...

248
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,100
只有一種方法
There's only one way

249
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,940
能讓你那么快到達那里
you could have gotten there so quickly --

250
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,990
你根本沒走
you never left.

251
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,010
你太激動了
I think you're getting all wound up.

252
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,610
你得深呼吸...
Can you just take a few deep br--

253
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,040
你賄賂了他...
You bribed him --

254
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,850
-那個柜員  -什么
- that kid behind the counter. - What?

255
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,520
趁著歐內斯托離開而我還沒到
Between the time Ernesto left and I arrived,

256
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,340
你給了那個笨蛋錢
you paid that half-wit to swear

257
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,740
-讓他說他從沒見過你  -麥吉爾先生
- he'd never laid eyes on you. - Mr. McGill.

258
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,320
然后你就在附近一直看著
And then you stuck around to watch.

259
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,200
-為什么  想看我受苦嗎  -麥吉爾先生
- Why? Just wanted to see me suffer? - Mr. McGill.

260
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,070
想看我出洋相嗎
Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?

261
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,110
我給他打了電話
I called him.

262
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,610
什么
What?

263
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,800
我在接你之前  給吉米打了電話
I called Jimmy earlier, before I picked you up.

264
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,850
他出現是因為我給他打了電話
He showed up when he did because I called him.

265
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,800
我很擔心你  所以...
I was worried about you, and I just --

266
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,830
我給他打了電話  對不起
I called him. I'm sorry.

267
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,660
出去  你們兩個都出去
Get out...both of you.

268
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,890
查克  有件事我必須得做
Chuck, there's something that I have to do,

269
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,660
真的很抱歉
and I'm really sorry --

270
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,030
真的非常抱歉
really, truly sorry,

271
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,570
但我必須做  為了你好
but I gotta do it, and it's for you.

272
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,660
你想讓我住院
You're trying to have me committed.

273
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,300
不  只是臨時...
No, it's a Temporary --

274
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,570
臨時緊急監護人
Temporary ‭Emergency Guardianship --

275
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,100
說法不同而已
to-may-to, to-mah-to.

276
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,460
你終于把我關起來了
Well, you've finally got me where you want me.

277
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,660
你看起來累壞了
Hey, you look beat.

278
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,550
回家休息吧
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

279
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,620
我還撐得住
I'm fine to hang out, you know?

280
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,840
有什么需要盡管說
Whatever you need.

281
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,050
沒事  不用了
Nah. We're good here.

282
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,360
歐尼
Hey, Ernie.

283
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,850
你為什么說你給我打了電話
Uh, how come you said that about callin' me?

284
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,740
我也不知道
I don't know, man.

285
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,240
我本不想多嘴
Look, I didn't want to say anything,

286
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
但是你哥哥...
but your brother --

287
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,710
最近他說起你時的樣子...
the way he's been ‭talkin' about you lately --

288
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,740
就好像...他真的要收拾你  吉米
it's like...he's really out to get you, Jimmy.

289
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,550
我說不清
And...I don't know.

290
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,170
你是我的朋友
You're my friend.

291
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,310
謝謝
Thanks.

292
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,990
我明天給你電話
I'll call you tomorrow.

293
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,000
真懷念收發室
I miss the mailroom.

294
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,200
你們知道希波克拉底誓言嗎
Are you familiar with the Hippocratic oath?

295
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,590
你們應該知道
You should be.

296
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,810
歷史上最古老的具有約束力的文件之一
One of the oldest binding documents in history.

297
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,200
首先  不要傷害病人
Primum non nocere -- first, do no harm.

298
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,380
你們這樣對待我是不對的
This is not the way to treat my condition.

299
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,720
就好像  我對青霉素過敏
It's as though I had a -- an allergy to penicillin,

300
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,110
而你們卻非要用它來治療我的感染
and yet, you persist on treating my infection with it.

301
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,130
感謝你做類比  查爾斯
I appreciate the analogy, Charles,

302
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,450
但我覺得這個類比并不恰當
but I don't think it quite fits.

303
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,880
我們會在你不知不覺間
Look, we'll have you in and out of Radiology

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,670
就做完放射檢查的  好嗎
before you know it, all right?

305
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,880
然后我們會摘掉頸托
Then we can see about getting that neck collar off

306
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,350
讓你活動活動
and get you moving around.

307
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,530
好了  查爾斯  掃描就要開始了
Okay, Charles, the scan is starting now.

308
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,700
你躺著的臺子會移動
The table that you're on is going to move.

309
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,180
你會聽到一聲比較大的聲響
You're gonna hear a sound that might seem loud to you,

310
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,970
但是不用擔心
but it's nothing to worry about.

311
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,740
還沒消息呢
Still no word?

312
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,580
天啊
Jesus.

313
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,190
到底要花多久啊
How long is this gonna take?

314
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,180
她說整個檢查也就十分鐘而已
She said that whole test would be like 10 minutes.

315
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,120
也許他們得重做
Maybe they had to start over.

316
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,120
重做二十次嗎
What -- 20 times?

317
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,150
他應該回家
He should be home.

318
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,500
吉米  你這么做是對的
Jimmy, you're doin' the right thing.

319
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,620
你能把工作拿出來做嗎
Would you get your work out, please?

320
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,550
因為不知道還要在這等多久
Becouse God knows how much longer we're gonna be here.

321
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,550
如果你能做點別的我會感覺好點
I'd feel better ‭if you were doing something,

322
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,840
做點跟醫院無關的事
you know, unhospital-y.

323
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,850
跟醫院無關的
Unhospital-y.

324
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,220
好的
I'm on it.

325
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,290
我去問一下情況
You know what? I'm gonna go ask for an update.

326
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,540
好主意
Okay. Good idea.

327
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,460
你們是最偉大的一代
You are the greatest generation.

328
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,960
-吉米  -你們沒有挑起二戰
- Jimmy. ‭- You didn't start World War II,

329
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,200
但卻終結了它
but you sure as heck finished it.

330
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,470
如果這還不夠
And if that weren't enough,

331
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,700
你們還把九十多米高的火箭送上了月球
you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.

332
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,710
現在  你們到了遲暮之年
Now, in your golden years,

333
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,110
你們需要有人照顧
you need someone looking out for you,

334
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,850
需要一個可以信任的人
someone you can trust,

335
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,340
一個言必信  行必果的人
a man who says what he does and does what he says.

336
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,510
當你需要一個可靠的人
When you need someone to count on...

337
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,870
-我選吉米  -我選吉米
- Gimme Jimmy! - Gimme Jimmy!

338
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,380
我選吉米
Gimme Jimmy!

339
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,460
因為現在勇氣已經很少見了
Because moxie is in such short supply these days.

340
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,720
吉米·麥吉爾  你可以信賴的律師
Jimmy McGill -- A lawyer you can trust.

341
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,280
太棒了  吉米
It's really good, Jimmy.

342
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,040
你拍了一條很棒的廣告
You made a really good commercial.

343
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,780
謝了
Thanks.

344
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
吉米
Jimmy.

345
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,810
總算出來了  他怎么樣了
Oh, finally. So, how is he?

346
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,240
好消息是生理上無大礙
Well, the good news is that, physically, he's okay.

347
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,590
放射科醫生說查爾斯的
The radiologist said everything looks normal

348
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,250
頭和脊椎都很正常
with Charles' head and spine,

349
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,030
所以我們把他的頸圈卸了
so we took his neck collar off.

350
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,890
他頭部的傷會很快愈合
His head wound will heal just fine.

351
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,250
給他打了破傷風
We gave him a tetanus shot

352
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,420
因為他的接種記錄不是最新的
because his immunization records were not current.

353
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,230
你肯定不意外
I'm sure ‭that's no surprise to you.

354
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,390
那他心臟呢
And -- And -- And his heart?

355
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,260
很強健
Strong.

356
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,060
心電圖正常
The EKG was normal.

357
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,620
至于失去知覺  最可能的原因是
As far as losing consciousness, my best guess is

358
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,890
查爾斯的暈厥和壓力有關
Charles had what's called a stress-related syncope.

359
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,930
一般是恐慌癥發作
It's basically a panic attack,

360
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,950
但沒有中風和心臟問題
but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event.

361
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,100
但還是有...
However, there was...

362
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,230
并發癥
a complication.

363
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,050
查克  兄弟是我
Chuck? Hey, buddy, it's me.

364
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,780
醫生說一切正常  我們出院吧
They said everything looks good, so let's get you outta here.

365
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,970
你說呢
Whaddya say?

366
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,110
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

367
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,560
藥效應該已經過去了  對吧
Whatever you gave him should've worn off already, right?

368
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,760
我們觀察他幾個小時了
We watched him for several hours.

369
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,200
甚至都用了逆轉劑
We even gave him ‭what's called a reversal agent.

370
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,420
沒錯  鎮靜劑藥效過了
So, yes, the sedative wore off.

371
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,310
-是因為其他原因  -什么原因
- This is something else. ‭- What?

372
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,740
我們認為這是自誘導緊張癥
We think it's a state of self-induced catatonia.

373
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,730
"我們"  永遠是"我們認為"
"We" -- always with the "We."

374
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,770
我覺得就是你認為
I think it's you.

375
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,770
你是這屋子里唯一的醫生
You're the only doctor in the room.

376
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,400
我認為是你用機器燒壞了他的腦子
I think you fried his brain with that machine.

377
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,250
吉米
Jimmy.

378
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,390
-抱歉  真是扯淡  -吉米
- I'm sorry. This is bullshit. - Jimmy.

379
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,030
下一步會怎么樣
What next?

380
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,590
我第一次治療查爾斯時  他也是類似的狀態
When I first treated Charles, he was in a similar state.

381
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,790
你同意嗎
Wouldn't you agree?

382
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,360
我相信他清醒過來
I have to believe ‭that it's just a matter of time

383
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,740
只是時間問題
before he comes out of it.

384
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,880
時間問題
Matter of time.

385
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,250
好  那我就在這等著
Fine, then. I'll wait right here.

386
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,750
偏左  一點五角分
Shot left. 1.5 minutes.

387
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,750
這把槍能連射多少發
How many rounds've gone through the tube?

388
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,480
你說魯格762狙擊槍嗎
For a 762?

389
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,320
就算射掉3500發也沒啥影響
You can put 3,500 through it and never know.

390
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,650
關鍵是能射多快
It's about how tight she shoots.

391
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,710
這把槍速度飛快
And this one's tight as they come.

392
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,200
順射擊方向有風
I'd say there's a breeze picking up downrange.

393
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,560
槍管會變冷嗎
Your barrel gonna be cold?

394
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,520
希望如此吧
Let's suppose so.

395
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,680
那你開槍最好多留心
Well, then, you'd better have paid attention to that shot.

396
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,500
是啊
I'd better have.

397
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,400
向右調整  一點五角分
Adjusting right, 1.5 minutes.

398
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,410
開槍吧
Send it.

399
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,240
中了
Hit.

400
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,740
正中紅心
Center hit.

401
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,810
我建議你不要換子彈
I suggest you don't change up your ammo.

402
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,620
繼續用168格令船尾中空彈
Stick with the 168 grain boat-tail hollow point --

403
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,630
如果沒有障礙物  選它沒錯
if it's an open shot, that is.

404
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,830
如果你要射穿很厚的窗戶
Now, if you got to shoot through a heavy window,

405
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,460
我建議你換到180格令
I'll up you to a 180.

406
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,140
但你就得重新計算射擊參數了
But as you know, you'll have to recalculate the shot.

407
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,500
168就夠了
168'll do it.

408
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,810
多少盒
How many boxes?

409
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,800
就一盒
Just the one.

410
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,620
不用了  免費
No, it's on the house.

411
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,800
還有一件事
Uh, one last thing.

412
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,950
無意冒犯
No offense.

413
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,310
沒事
None taken.

414
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,460
吉米  可以給我點水嗎
Jimmy, can I get some water?

415
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,660
查克  你醒了
Chuck. Hey, buddy, you're back with us.

416
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
你怎么...
How you...

417
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,970
可以給我點水嗎
Can I get some water, please?

418
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,330
好好  我去拿
Yeah, yeah, water.

419
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,950
該死  抱歉
Oh, shit. Sorry. ‭

420
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,270
還要嗎
Want some more?

421
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,330
我記得最后一件事
Last thing I remember

422
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,190
就是他們把我送進那臺機器里
was that machine they put me in.

423
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,150
我昏迷多久了
How long was I out for?

424
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,320
有二十個小時了
Was...20 hours.

425
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,280
下一個任務就是把你帶出這鬼地方
And next order of business -- get you the hell outta here.

426
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,450
去哪
Where to next --

427
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,370
拉斯克魯塞斯的精神病院嗎
some insane asylum in Las Cruces?

428
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,200
一個你可以真正把我藏起來的地方嗎
Some place you can really tuck me away, but good?

429
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,890
回家  查克  你要回家
Home, Chuck. You're goin' home.

430
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,570
你心臟很好
Well, your heart's okay,

431
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,120
頭上的傷也沒事
and so is that crack on your head,

432
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,300
我想知道的就這些
so that's all I wanted to know.

433
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,640
臨時緊急監護人呢
What about the T.E.G.?

434
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,250
"T"不正是臨時的意思嗎
The "T" stands for "Temporary," Right?

435
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,550
你想上床嗎
You wanna go to bed?

436
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,770
不不  這更涼快
No, no. ‭It's -- It's cooler down here.

437
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,350
你還需要什么
What can I get you?

438
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,030
我給你泡點茶  好茶葉
I'll make you some tea -- uh, the good stuff,

439
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,980
不是醫院里那種發黃的水
not that brown water they have at the hospital.

440
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,940
不用了
I'm fine.

441
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,140
我去給你泡茶
I'll make you some tea.

442
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,320
吉米  別去
Jimmy. No.

443
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,020
你就...
Just --

444
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,390
你已經完成任務了
You've done your duty.

445
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,590
你可以走了
You can go now.

446
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,490
我有點咄咄逼人了
That came out a bit harsh.

447
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,500
我在醫院時已經被百般折磨了
Look, I've been zapped and poked and prodded,

448
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,200
現在  我只想自己待會
and now I just I wanna be left alone.

449
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,890
如果你身體又出什么問題
If things start going south for you again,

450
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,250
我怎么能知道呢
how am I even gonna know?

451
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,530
我沒事的  我保證
I'm fine. I promise.

452
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,040
看見沒
See?

453
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,590
已經感覺好多了
Feeling better already.

454
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,100
我連鑰匙都沒有
I mean, ‭I don't even have a key, so...

455
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,190
我能叫歐尼回來嗎
Can I get Ernie back here?

456
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,460
至少讓我為你做這件事  行嗎
Would you let me ‭do that for you, at least?

457
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,220
你需要有人來照看你
You need someone lookin' in on ya.

458
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,410
你得吃飯  不是嗎
You gotta eat, right?

459
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,120
好吧
All right.

460
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,500
早日康復  查克
Feel better, Chuck.

461
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,240
{\an8}別這么做

462
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,290
好的  我這就去辦
All right, I will get right on that.

463
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,580
下周應該就能幫你辦好
I should have it for you by early next week.

464
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,620
祝你今日愉快  柯林斯先生
You have yourself ‭a wonderful day, Mr. Collins.

465
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,090
對了
Oh! There you go.

466
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,640
把墨鏡拿出來
Yeah, get the sunglasses out.

467
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,870
外面很亮
It's very bright.

468
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,970
得保護好眼睛
Gotta protect the ol' peepers.

469
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,270
你得...
You gotta...

470
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,260
好  帥呆了
Yep, looking sharp.

471
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,230
就這樣
Bingo.

472
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,020
回頭見
Uh, bye-bye, now.

473
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,370
好了
Okay.

474
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,000
大家好  抱歉讓你們久等
Folks, I'm sorry about the wait,

475
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,380
我為每位委托人花這么長時間
but the attention I give each client means

476
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,120
意味著有時候大家需要等等
sometimes, things get a little...backed up.

477
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,320
不過我向你們保證
Uh but I promise

478
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,880
會按順序為你們服務
to get to each and every one of you in turn.

479
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,070
德謝佐女士  親愛的  你是下一位
Mrs. DeShazo, my dear, I believe you're next.

480
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,250
先問一句  有誰想喝咖啡嗎
But first, may I get anybody some coffee?

481
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,060
我能和你談談嗎
Can I talk to you?

482
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,900
稍等一下
Uh, excuse me one second.

483
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,700
我們昨天就得找個前臺了
We have got to get a receptionist -- like, yesterday.

484
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,170
吉米  霍華德剛才來電話了
Jimmy, Howard just called.

485
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,140
他說他一早上都在聯系你
He says he's been trying to reach you all morning.

486
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,000
那又怎樣  叫他別煩你了  給我留言
So? Tell him to stop bothering you and leave me a message.

487
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,640
是查克的事
It's about Chuck.

488
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,270
他只說很重要
It's impmptant -- that's all he'll say.

489
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,730
好吧
Okay.

490
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,000
很遺憾  我的同事告訴我
Unfortunately, uh, my associate tells me

491
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,480
我有簡短但緊急的法律事務要處理
I'm needed for some brief but pressing legal business.

492
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,110
我很快打個電話就好
I just need to make one quick phone call.

493
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,060
誰想要咖啡來著
Uh, in the meantime, who was it who wanted coffee?

494
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,560
好的  這位年輕的女士會給你們倒咖啡
Yeah, okay, uh, this young lady will get you coffee...

495
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,090
還有面包圈  如果還有的話
and, also, doughnuts if there are any left.

496
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,660
我要咖啡  不加奶
I want coffee, but I do not want cream.

497
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,210
朱莉  是我  給霍華德回電話
Hey, Julie, it's me, returning Howard's call.

498
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,460
對
Yeah.

499
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,750
怎么了
Hey, what's up?

500
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,340
吉米  我就問一個問題
Jimmy, ‭I have just one question --

501
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,140
這是你策劃的嗎
are you behind this?

502
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,980
策劃什么
Am I behind what?

503
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,210
吉米  我現在正忙著呢
Jimmy, I'm kind of in the middle of somethin' right now.

504
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,670
-過會再來吧  -不  不  不
- Come back later. - No, no, no.

505
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,060
拜托  把門打開
Come on. Open the door.

506
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,700
我知道你為什么來  我們可以一會再說
I know why you're here. We can discuss it later.

507
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,770
我正忙著呢  再見
Right now I'm busy, goodbye.

508
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,550
滿意了吧
You happy now?

509
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,270
這樣不行  我連這里的鑰匙都沒有
It's not right -- me not havin' a key to this place.

510
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,430
查克
Chuck?

511
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,430
查克  這怎么回事
So, Chuck...uh, what's up?

512
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,960
你弄了個...
You got a little, uh --

513
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,600
你弄了個工程啊
You got a little, uh, uh, project goin' on?

514
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,210
你想跟我說說這是怎么回事嗎
Uh, something you maybe wanna tell me about?

515
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,780
查克  跟我說說行嗎
Whaddya say, Chuck? Y-- Uh, clue me in?

516
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,720
這些墻是石膏和板條的
These walls are plaster and lath --

517
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,460
對無線電波完全沒防護作用
completely invisible to the radio spectrum.

518
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,720
一點也沒有
No protection at all --

519
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,790
我還不如直接站到一片牧草地里呢
I might as well be standing in the middle of a pasture.

520
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,940
真不知道當初自己怎么想的
I don't know what I was thinking.

521
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,510
一開始就該這樣
Shoulda done this from the start.

522
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,420
你是說這么做  用...
What, you shoulda done this, with the, uh --

523
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,120
我覺得這些墻還挺結實的
See, I think these walls are pretty solid. I think --

524
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,290
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}一種金屬材質外殼  能阻止電磁波進入

525
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,290
我需要的是一個法拉第籠
See, what I really need is a proper Faraday cage.

526
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,670
那才是我需要的
That's what I need.

527
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,620
我們該坐下來  休息一會  伙計
I think we need to sit down, take a break, buddy.

528
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,550
求你了
Please?

529
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,840
別跟我來這一套  吉米
Do not patronize me, Jimmy.

530
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,790
我沒瘋  好嗎
I'm not crazy, all right?

531
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,070
我從沒說你瘋了
‭I-I never said you were crazy.

532
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,740
你可能只是累壞了
That -- You're probably exhausted,

533
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,450
情有可原
a-and justifiably.

534
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,760
聽著
Hey, come on. Hey.

535
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,850
就五分鐘  然后你接著忙你的
Five minutes, and then right back at it.

536
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,170
我沒事
I'm fine.

537
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,280
來吧  查克
Come on, Chuck.

538
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,200
休息一會
Just a break.

539
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,830
-小心點  -我知道
- Careful. - ‭I know.

540
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,680
霍華德說你辭職了
Howard tells me you quit HHM.

541
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,030
我沒有辭職
I didn't quit.

542
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,300
我退休了
I retired.

543
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,510
聽起來可不像這么回事
That's not what it sounded like.

544
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,130
不管怎樣  這太突然了  你不覺得嗎
Regardless, it's kinda outta the blue, don't you think?

545
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,810
他很擔心你
He's worried about you.

546
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,820
他該松了一口氣才對
He should be relieved.

547
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,820
松了一口氣  怎么會
Relieved? Why would he be relieved?

548
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,990
你可是他的頂梁柱
You're his Number One Guy.

549
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,550
沒了你  律所肯定每況愈下
Without you, that whole place goes down the drain.

550
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,650
所以  你退休了
So, you -- you retired --

551
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,640
不僅從哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所退休
not just from HHM,

552
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,530
也退出律師界了嗎
but the law?

553
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,530
這可不好  查克
That's not good, Chuck.

554
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,570
律師界  需要你
The -- The law... needs you.

555
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,040
別說了
Just stop it.

556
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,790
你也需要它
And you need it.

557
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,090
到底是為什么  查克
What brought this on exactly, Chuck?

558
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,830
你不做律師還能做什么
'Cause I don't know what you are if you're not a lawyer.

559
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,490
你還沒讓我被取消律師資格
How are you gonna retire before you get me disbarred,

560
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,670
還沒把我趕出城  怎么能退休
before you run me outta town on a rail, huh?

561
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,620
以后可就我一個麥吉爾在律師界混了
I'll be the only McGill carrying the family name.

562
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,970
你怎么忍得了
You can't have that.

563
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,520
是因為  你沒能挽回梅薩維德銀行嗎
Is this... ‭'cause you lost Mesa Verde?

564
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,200
那又怎樣  誰會在意
So what? Who cares?

565
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,070
而且  如果你真的覺得
And, hey, if you truly do think

566
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,470
這事是我在背后捅你刀子
that I rat-fucked you on that thing --

567
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,930
當然我并沒有  不過隨便了
which I did not, but whatever --

568
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,220
你知道嗎
well, you know what?

569
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,220
你應該生氣  應該報復
You get mad! Take action!

570
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,190
別躲在你這法拉第什么
Don't just hide out in your -- your Faraday whatever --

571
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,750
破籠子里
your cage thing here.

572
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,510
不  你該永遠不退休才對
No! You -- No retirement for you!

573
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,830
等你九十九歲了
When you're 99,

574
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,100
還要對著機器人法官做結辯陳詞  然后倒地身亡
you can drop dead giving closing arguments to JudgeBot 3000 --

575
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,130
對了  那東西也是用電的
which will run on electricity, by the way.

576
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,020
這才是你的未來好嗎
That's your future, okay?

577
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,530
-所以  -我
- So... ‭ - I...

578
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,020
我做不了這個工作了
‭I can't do the job anymore.

579
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,880
什么意思  你怎么就干不了了
What do you mean? ‭'Course you can do the job.

580
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,990
我犯了一個錯誤
I made a mistake.

581
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,160
什么錯誤
What mistake?

582
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,050
一個很小的錯誤  把銀行地址搞錯了
A simple, ‭nothing little bank address --

583
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,920
1261號寫成了1216號
1216 instead of 1261.

584
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,210
我搞砸了
I screwed it up!

585
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,770
我讓委托人蒙受損失
I hurt the client.

586
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,240
徹徹底底搞砸了
Blew it completely and utterly.

587
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,540
而且我還把這怪到你頭上
And then I blamed -- And then I blamed you.

588
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,670
都怪這該死的電流
It's this goddamned electricity!

589
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,110
一點一點消磨我  把我的機能消磨殆盡
It's wearing me down! It's wearing down my faculties!

590
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,570
我的頭腦  我的思維  它曾經
My brain...my mind -- it used to be --

591
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,660
它曾經那么敏捷
You know, it used to work!

592
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,300
可現在完全不管用了
And now it doesn't anymore.

593
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,520
有人因為我而受傷害
People got hurt because of me.

594
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,950
是時候結束了
Time to end it.

595
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,450
如果我告訴你你并沒有犯錯呢
What if I told you ‭you didn't make a mistake?

596
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,680
天哪  吉米  別來安慰我了
For Christ's sakes, Jimmy, stop humoring me.

597
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,190
別說得好像一切都不是我的錯
Stop trying to talk everything right.

598
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,640
我背叛了你
I rat-fucked you.

599
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,270
是我干的
It was me.

600
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,870
尼克松都得為我自豪
I would made Nixon proud.

601
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,530
我把1261改成了1216
I changed 1261 to 1216.

602
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,270
是我干的
It was me.

603
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,710
事情的經過就像你說的一樣
It all went down exactly like you said --

604
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,410
分毫不差
I mean, exactly.

605
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,320
我篡改了文件
I doctored the copies.

606
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,960
買通打印店的小伙子讓他為我撒謊
I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me.

607
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,110
每一個細節都如你所料  你太神了
It is insane how you got every detail exactly right.

608
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,580
這下你能放心了吧
So you can relax, okay?

609
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,310
你的腦子好用著呢  馬力十足
'Cause that brain of yours is chugging along at 1,000% efficiency.

610
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,310
你說的是真的嗎
Are you telling the truth,

611
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,320
還是你只是為了讓我好受點
or are you just trying to make me feel better?

612
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,130
當然是為了讓你好受點
I am sayin' it to make ya feel better.

613
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,560
不然我怎么可能說出來
I sure as shit wouldn't be telling ya otherwise.

614
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,740
但是  沒錯  這就是真的
But, yes... it's the truth.

615
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,920
你這么大費周章就為了羞辱我嗎
You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?

616
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,570
我是為了金
I did it for Kim!

617
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,180
她廢寢忘食地拿下梅薩維德銀行
What -- She worked her butt off to get Mesa Verde

618
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,300
而你和霍華德就喝喝威士忌坐享其成
while you and Howard sat around sipping Scotch and chortling.

619
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,080
什么哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill --

{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}狄更斯小說中的守財奴

620
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,480
應該叫斯克魯奇馬利律所才對
more like Scrooge and Marley!

622
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,310
梅薩維德銀行是金的
Kim deserves Mesa Verde --

623
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,840
不是你  也不是哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的
not you, not HHM.

624
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,440
她爭取來的  她需要它
She earned it, and she needs it!

625
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,070
我這么做是為了幫她
I did it to help her,

626
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,680
但我真不知道這會給你帶來那么大的傷害
but I-I honestly didn't think it would hurt you so bad.

627
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,460
我以為你只會說  "靠  我犯了個錯誤"
I thought you'd just say, "Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

628
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,890
然后繼續過你的日子  這才是正常人會干的
and go on with your life, like a normal person!

629
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,180
可你偏不
But, oh, no!

630
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,620
是我打錯了如意算盤
Wishful thinking!

631
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,300
所以  我能不能告訴霍華德
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

632
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,280
你不辭職也不退休了
you're not quitting or retiring or whatever?

633
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,360
還有  能不能把這些破玩意從墻上弄下來
And can we take all this shit down off the walls?

634
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,690
我這就打電話給霍華德
I'm gonna go call Howard.

635
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,650
吉米
Jimmy.

636
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,580
你剛剛承認犯了一項重罪你知道吧
You do realize ‭you just confessed to a felony?

637
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,760
算是吧
I guess.

638
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,280
可你覺得好多了  是吧
But you feel better, right?

639
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,180
再說了  就我們倆  空口無憑
Besides, ‭it's your word against mine.
