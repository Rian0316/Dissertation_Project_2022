1
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,890

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,200
Whatcha doin' there?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,100
Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,940
The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,300
Yes.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,970
And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,940
that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,010
Yes.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,850
What I'm doing here

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,190
is trying to determine when I'm going to die.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,690
A lot of people are working on that research.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,430
So what is all this?

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,330
My family history factoring in longevity

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,730
propensity for disease, et cetera.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,800
Interesting.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
What's "KBB"?

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,370
"Killed by badger."

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,110
How's that?

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,180
It was Thanksgiving.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,810
Uncle Carl said, "I think there's a badger living in our chimney. "

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,720
"Hand me that flashlight."

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,950
Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,350
I don't think you need

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,360
to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,830
Not true.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,530
The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically.

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,530
Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,200
against a brawny member of the weasel family.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,010
You can always get a badger and find out.

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,650
But seriously

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,280
even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,750
at best I have 60 years left.

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,350
That long, huh?

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,020
60 only takes me to here.

37
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,190
I need to get to here.

38
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,060
What's there?

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,830
The earliest estimate of the singularity

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,060
when man will be able to transfer his consciousness

41
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,770
into machines and achieve immortality.

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,200
So, you're upset about missing out

43
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,910
on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,940
By this much.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,210
Tough break.  You want eggs?

46
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,980
You don't get it, Leonard.

47
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,580
I'm going to miss so much.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,120
the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus.

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
What's a dogapus?

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,930
The hybrid dog and octopus.

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,900
Man's underwater best friend.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,470
Is somebody working on that?

53
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,730
I was going to.

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,410
I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.

55
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,470
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.

56
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,810
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls.

57
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,480
No one can hate that.

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,290
What do we owe you?

59
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,760
It came to $28.17.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,890
Let's say six bucks apiece.

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,660
Here you go.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,890
Thank you.

63
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,030
What?

64
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,330
Never mind. I got it.

65
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,870
Oh, you wanted me to pay.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,100
- It's no big deal. - No, no, no, no. You're right.

67
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,540
We're not going out anymore; I should pay for myself.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,510
What?

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,810
He said, "If he had woman parts

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,420
"he'd eat for free the rest of his life"

71
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,590
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself.

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm a little low on cash.

73
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,330
- How much you got?  - Nothing.

74
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,860
How can you walk around with no money?

75
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm cute. I get by.

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,260
It's okay, you can owe me.

77
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,500
- Thank you.  - Sheldon, six bucks.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,270
No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.

79
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,370
But it's Thursday.

80
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,010
Thursday's pizza night.

81
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,110
Not for me.

82
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,180
Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,550
Tonight's selection: Brussels sprouts.

84
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,680
Really?

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,380
You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,490
- It's a small price to pay. - For what?

87
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,020
- No, no, don't ask. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,360
In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,960
with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,230
Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?

91
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,200
Correct.

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?

93
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,900
Essentially, yes.

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,170
Okay, here's my question.

95
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,600
Didn't you already do that?

96
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,580
Flattering, but sadly, no.

97
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,050
I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen

98
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,480
designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system.

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,750
AKA jogging.

100
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,320
Wait. Honey, have you ever run before?

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,620
Certainly.

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,830
I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens...

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,460
and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher

104
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,730
determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.

105
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,840
You're right. Penny jogs.

106
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,410
Maybe you guys can run together.

107
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,770
That's an excellent idea.

108
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,510
Yeah, if we chat

109
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,750
it will create the illusion of time going faster.

110
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,750
No, it won't.

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,990
Um, how does he know I jog?

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,260
Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.

113
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,130
Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

114
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,790
I know!

115
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,500
And he says he's not gonna stop.

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,140
Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.

117
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,250
What the hell?

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,590
What's the matter?

119
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,630
I have pain radiating from my navel

120
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,460
to my lower right abdomen.

121
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm nauseated and feverish.

122
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,430
I believe I may have cholera.

123
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,770
There's no cholera in Pasadena.

124
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,870
Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

125
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,240
Well, if it's not cholera

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,140
then based on a quick Internet search

127
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,010
the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood

128
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,880
are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,790
or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.

130
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,590
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

131
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,190
It's part of an unlikely scenario

132
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,830
that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart

133
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,060
with a less-than- vigilant proprietor.

134
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh, Lord, my belly!

135
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,370
Ever had your appendix out?

136
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,600
I haven't.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,070
I've been meaning to, but who has the time?

138
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,640
Let's get you to the hospital.

139
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,840
So this is how it ends...

140
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,980
with cruel irony.

141
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,280
Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,820
I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ.

143
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,290
Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?

144
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,390
No.

145
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,260
I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on.

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,430
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

147
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,140
Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!

148
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,210
On the other hand

149
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,940
it might have been the Brussels sprouts.

150
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,480
Good night.

151
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,780
Good night.

152
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,380
Appendicitis.

153
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,090
What a nervous Nelly.

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,460
Penny! Penny! Penny!

155
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,360
Coming, coming.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,300
Hey, nice knees.

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,370
Thank you.

158
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,400
They're my mother's.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,940
Oh. And the Flash shirt is what?

160
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Because, what, you're gonna run really fast?

161
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,670
No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday

162
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,140
but it's nice when things work out.

163
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,240
- Where's your heart rate monitor?  - I don't have one.

164
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,010
- What about your pedometer?  - Don't have one.

165
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,550
Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?

166
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,480
- Uh, no.  - What do you do

167
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,920
You just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?

168
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,530
No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.

169
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,260
Why are you doing that?

170
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,900
It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,170
All right.

172
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,370
Let's start with a toe touch.

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,410
Okay, you do it.

174
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,380
I am doing it.

175
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,080
Oh. Wow. Good job.

176
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,020
Can you do this?

177
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,790
We'll never know.

178
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,090
Okay, let's just warm up on the run.

179
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,730
- Okay.  - Okay, let's go.

180
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,760
I've been reading up on biomechanics.

181
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
I think you'll be surprised at my...

182
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,140
Oh, my God, are you okay?

183
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,270
I think so.

184
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,610
- Oh, let me help you up.  - Thank you.

185
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,380
Oh, Sheldon!

186
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
If it makes you feel any better

187
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,880
Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

188
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,520
Here's my chicken curry.

189
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,920
Howard, your shrimp biryani.

190
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,020
- Thank you, sir.  - Palak paneer, that's Penny.

191
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,760
- Thanks.  - And for Rajesh Koothrappali

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,930
from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate

193
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,330
one large order of chicken McNuggets.

194
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
- Hey, what's my share?  - Uh... 12 bucks.

195
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,240
- Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?  - Sure.

196
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,970
What am I up to now?

197
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,310
Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza

198
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,340
the Thai food, the tank of gas

199
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,010
the frozen yogurt

200
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,320
and your rent, uh...

201
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,180
a little over $1,400.

202
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,420
What now?

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,390
He's just expressing his admiration that

204
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,190
you don't even have to put out to get free stuff.

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,100
It's not free-- I'm gonna pay him back.

206
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,270
Shut up!

207
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,670
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

208
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,240
Coming!

209
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,830
Greetings, friends.

210
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,900
Greetings, whatever the hell you are.

211
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,300
I am a mobile virtual presence device.

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,900
Recent events

213
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,340
have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile

214
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,840
to endure the vicissitudes of the world.

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,310
Until such time as I am able

216
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,740
to transfer my consciousness

217
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,580
I shall remain in a secure location

218
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,920
and interact with the world in this manner.

219
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
Really? That's your question--

220
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,650
when did he put a ramp in?

221
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,930
You're in my spot.

222
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,820
This may seem a little odd at first

223
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,460
but over time, you'll grow accustomed

224
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,760
to dealing with me in this configuration.

225
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,660
Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.

226
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,860
Thank you.

227
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,070
That's what I was going for.

228
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,770
Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work

229
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,740
you'll need to allow some extra time

230
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,540
to get me down the stairs.

231
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,210
For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.

232
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,250
This is ridiculous.

233
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm coming to talk to you.

234
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,720
You don't know where I am.

235
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,760
My physical body is safely ensconced

236
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,460
in a secure, undisclosed location.

237
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,060
You're in your bedroom.

238
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
No, I'm not.

239
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,000
I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.

240
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,330
No, you can't.

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,670
Wait.

242
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,040
Come back.

243
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,310
Halt.

244
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,710
Authorized personnel only!

245
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,180
So, either one of you weirdos

246
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,180
want to buy my underwear? Only 1,400 bucks.

247
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,690
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

248
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,260
I'm behind you.

249
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,460
Please look at me when you're talking to me.

250
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,960
I am looking at you.

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,260
No, you're not.

252
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,730
Pay no attention to that man in the bed.

253
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,770
You cannot exist as a virtual presence.

254
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,640
Not here and certainly not at work.

255
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,510
Oh, good God.

256
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,110
At my age, do you know

257
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,940
how I'm statistically most likely to die?

258
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,210
At the hands of your roommate?

259
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,780
An accident.

260
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,250
That's how I'm going to make it look.

261
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,890
Until I can transfer my intellect

262
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,190
to a more durable container

263
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,960
my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.

264
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,030
Fine, but don't expect my help.

265
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,590
You have to help-- it's in the roommate agreement.

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,100
No, it's not.

267
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,430
Section 74.C.

268
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,940
The various obligations and duties of the parties

269
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,570
in the event one of them becomes a robot.

270
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll be damned.

271
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,420
This is delightful.

272
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Uh-huh.

273
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,690
It's much easier to enjoy

274
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,700
the picturesque route we travel to work

275
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,930
when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death.

276
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,200
Refresh my memory.

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?

278
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,770
Because I called shotgun. Remember?

279
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,440
Right.

280
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,780
You seem tense.

281
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,480
Perhaps this will relax you.

282
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,630
I don't want to listen to music, Sheldon.

283
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,230
Very well.

284
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,140
I don't understand why you're not enjoying this.

285
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,670
Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities

286
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,210
we're like Knight Rider.

287
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,210

288
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,010
Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,950
You mock the sphincter

290
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,720
but the sphincter is a class of muscle

291
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,190
without which human beings couldn't survive.

292
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,530
There are over 50 different sphincters

293
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,200
in the human body.

294
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,560
How many can you name?

295
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,470
I was wrong-- this is exactly like Knight Rider.

296
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.

297
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,070
No.

298
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,670
This is a photograph of the 1911

299
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta.

300
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,580
Using Photoshop, I've introduced a few anachronisms.

301
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,950
See if you can spot all 24.

302
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,450
I'll give you the first one.

303
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,760
Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch.

304
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,130
And go.

305
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,560

306
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
That's it. Bye-bye.

307
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,130
Bazinga.

308
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,540
I have an override switch.

309
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
I almost died!

310
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,640
And I'm safe and sound in bed.

311
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,810
Who's crazy now?

312
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,510
I'm still going to go with you.

313
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,520
Hello, Professor Hoskins.

314
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,260
Nice to see you, Mindy.

315
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,060
And konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamura.

316
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,700
Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory.

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Leonard, my door.

318
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,970
What about it?

319
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,810
Be a lamb and open it for me.

320
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,750
Why? What's the problem?

321
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,560
You think you have me stymied, don't you?

322
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,030
No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.

323
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,600
Oh, look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.

324
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,600

325
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,100
That's my joke. I told it last night.

326
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,370
You can't just use it.

327
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,770
Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.

328
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,340
Oh, sure.

329
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,150
He's a lamb.

330
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,950
You're not.

331
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,550
I'm a lamb.

332
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,660
Isn't this nice?

333
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,930
The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie

334
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,060
without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.

335
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,170
I say we just take him to Tatooine

336
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,130
and sell him to some Jawas.

337
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,800
That's two, dude.

338
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,540
Write your own jokes.

339
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,670
Oh, great.

340
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,340
Hi, I'm Penny, I'll be your waitress.

341
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,980
Why are you introducing yourself?

342
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,150
I'd rather people not know

343
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,680
I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.

344
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,850
Can you tell me the specials this evening?

345
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,350
Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.

346
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,320
Obviously.

347
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't even have water yet.

348
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,130
Because you're not here.

349
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,560
That's discrimination against the otherwise located.

350
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm going to have to go over your head.

351
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,300
Manager... manager.

352
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,040
Oh, Lord, look who it is.

353
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,210
Is that Steve Wozniak?

354
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,110
I think it is.

355
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,850
The Great and Powerful Woz.

356
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Penny, Steve Wozniak was

357
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,890
one of the cofounders of Apple Computer.

358
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,320
- He and Steve Jobs started it...  - Yeah

359
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,460
I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.

360
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,460

361
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,530
I must speak to him.

362
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,930
Of course you must.

363
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,630
You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street.

364
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,200
You guys should try it sometime.

365
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,170
Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?

366
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,340
Oh, hey.

367
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,240
Nice virtual presence device.

368
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Thank you.

369
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,810
I just want to say I'm a big fan.

370
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,710
You're my 15th favorite technological visionary.

371
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,380
Only 15th?

372
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,990
It's still six spots above Steve Jobs.

373
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,190
I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.

374
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,560
Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.

375
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,500
One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.

376
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,040
Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,340
it was a pretty nifty little achievement.

378
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,610
Thanks, we were shooting for "nifty."

379
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,480
You know, if you had it here

380
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,080
I'd autograph it for you.

381
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,310
Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes

382
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,020
depending on how the buses are running.

383
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,290
Nerds.

384
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,690
I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

385
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,040
Penny... Penny... Penny.

386
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,930
What up, Shel-Bot?

387
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,800
I can't get out of bed.

388
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,170
I hurt my ankle.

389
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,770
What do you want me to do?

390
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,100
Sing me "Soft Kitty."

391
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,810
Really, you want me to sing "Soft Kitty"

392
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,440
to a computer monitor?

393
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,280
Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?

394
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,550
Soft kitty, warm kitty

395
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,450
Little ball of fur...

396
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,050
Closer to the microphone.

397
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,360
Happy kitty, sleepy...

398
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,630
No.

399
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,900
You have to start over.

400
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,230
Soft kitty, warm kitty

401
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,370
Little ball of fur

402
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,170
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

403
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,140
Purr, purr, purr.
