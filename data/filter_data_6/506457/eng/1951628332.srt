1
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,865
Come here, lad.

2
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,589
What are you doing on my property?

3
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,840
I've come to claim back

4
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,675
what's rightfully mine, sir.

5
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,343
That thieving young rascal

6
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,053
made off with some horseshoes

7
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,930
and a bag of nails from my smithy.

8
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,399
Where is your proof?

9
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,819
The proof is, I'll find them there.

10
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,196
Now, I don't want to be forced

11
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,450
to call the police.

12
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,578
These people are guests of mine,

13
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:04,416
but you are trespassing, Mr. Thorn.

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,045
I'm not afraid of you, Doctor.

15
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,464
Get off my land!

16
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,496
Please, come back soon.

17
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,206
My dear, there is nothing

18
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,250
whatever to worry about.

19
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,504
We should be married in a few weeks.

20
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,216
I'm just on my way back to London.

21
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,261
Goodbye, sir, and thank you

22
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,930
for a most pleasant weekend.

23
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,515
I mean to improve my game of chess

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,142
before my next visit.

25
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,478
Oh, yes, I see.

26
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,856
You weren't an unworthy opponent.

27
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,861
Thank you, sir.

28
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,155
I'm just seeing Percy down to
the gates, Father.

29
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,365
Heh.

30
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,504
Drive on and wait for me
by the gate, will you.

31
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,154
The fellow was trespassing,

32
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,533
he had a dunking, and that is all.

33
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,203
Father, I cannot believe that
Thorn would deliberate -

34
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,122
Dammit, woman,

35
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,877
are you part of the conspiracy
against me, too?

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:23,305
No, Father, I live here.

37
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,226
Not for much longer, eh,

38
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:32,064
once you marry that fellow Armitage.

39
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,639
Yes, what is it?

40
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:10,561
Father, what has happened
to my room?

41
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,938
The builders found a fault
in the structure,

42
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,314
better sleep in your sister's room

43
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,317
till they've finished working on it.

44
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,739
Julia's room, I can't sleep in there.

45
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,617
Why not, Pray?

46
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,786
I can't.

47
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,246
What is the matter,

48
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,998
it's a perfectly good room.

49
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,457
I've instructed the housekeeper
to prepare it for you.

50
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,086
Now run along, your baggage,
and goodnight.

51
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:55,541
Hello there young beauty,
good night, good night.

52
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,229
I'm very sorry, Watson,

53
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,567
but it seems to be
the common lot this morning.

54
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,277
What?

55
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,821
Mrs. Hudson has been roused,

56
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,033
she retorted on me, and I on you.

57
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,161
But it's only a quarter past seven,

58
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,455
what is it, a fire?

59
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,791
No, No, a client.

60
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,713
This will take a moment to draw, sir.

61
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,799
But only a moment,
Mrs. Hudson is a mistress

62
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,427
of the art of fire lighting.

63
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,554
Ah, this is my intimate friend

64
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,473
and associate, Dr. Watson,

65
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,435
before whom you may speak
as freely as before myself.

66
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,270
How do you do?

67
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,730
Mrs. Hudson, do you think you could

68
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,149
bring this young lady
a hot cup of coffee,

69
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,195
for I observed you are shivering.

70
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,657
It is not cold which makes me shiver.

71
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,244
What, then?

72
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,497
It is fear, Mr. Holmes.

73
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,999
It is terror.

74
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,501
You must not fear,

75
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,002
we shall set matters right,

76
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,048
have no doubt.

77
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,844
You have come by train, I see,
this morning.

78
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,470
You know me, then?

79
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,181
No, but I observed the second half
of a return ticket

80
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,518
in the palm of your left glove.

81
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,062
You started early, but you had a drive

82
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,314
in a dog-cart, along heavy roads,

83
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,067
before you reached the station.

84
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,027
There is no mystery, my dear lady,

85
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,737
the left arm of your jacket

86
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,281
is spattered with mud

87
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,116
in no less than seven places,

88
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,034
the marks are fresh.

89
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,578
There is no vehicle

90
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,663
save a dog-cart which throws up mud

91
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,415
in that particular way,

92
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,417
and then only when you sit on

93
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,044
the left-hand side of the driver.

94
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,213
You are perfectly correct.

95
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,549
Sir, I can stand the strain no longer;

96
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,761
I shall go mad if it continues.

97
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,264
I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh,

98
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,143
whom you helped
in the hour of her sore need.

99
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,271
Farintosh.

100
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,031
My dear Helen,

101
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,616
it is difficult for me to advise you

102
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,534
since you present so few facts,

103
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,994
but I know you to be a sensible girl,

104
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,495
not prone to hysterics.

105
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,790
I was one of your poor,
dear mother's oldest friends.

106
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,377
I can only suggest that
if your fears persist,

107
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:31,757
you should contact
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

108
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,094
221B Baker Street.

109
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,599
Farintosh, oh, yes,
I do remember the case.

110
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,226
It concerned an opal tiara.

111
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,479
I think it was before your time, Watson.

112
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,565
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

113
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,276
Sir, do you not think
you could help me, too?

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,487
At present it is out of my power
to reward you,

115
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,364
but in a few weeks I should be married

116
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,366
with control of my own income.

117
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,493
I shall be happy to
devote the same care

118
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,746
to your case as to that of your friend.

119
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,456
As to reward my profession

120
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,583
is its own reward;

121
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,252
but you are at liberty to defray

122
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,088
whatever expenses I may be
put to at the time

123
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,673
which suits you best.

124
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,843
And now I beg you,
lay everything before us

125
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,430
which may help us form
an opinion upon this matter.

126
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,142
My name is Helen Stoner.

127
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,853
I live with my stepfather,

128
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,646
Dr. Grimesby Roylott,

129
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,982
who is the last survivor of
one of the oldest

130
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,567
Saxon families in England.

131
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,151
The Roylotts of Stoke Moran,

132
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,237
the name is familiar to me.

133
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,322
He is a doctor by profession,

134
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,157
a skilled one.

135
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,493
For some years he had a
large and flourishing practice

136
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,745
in India, in Calcutta.

137
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,831
Ah.

138
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,668
Dr. Watson has also practiced
medicine in India.

139
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:54,590
Yes, attached to the Fifth
Northumberland Fusiliers.

140
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,925
Pray continue, Miss Stoner.

141
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,721
In Calcutta, he married my mother.

142
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:05,517
She was the young widow of Major
mother's remarriage,

143
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,857
and my sister, Julia,
was five years older.

144
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,360
Our mother had a considerable
sum of money -

145
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,279
not less than a thousand a year -

146
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,740
and this she bequeathed to
Dr. Roylott entirely

147
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,575
while we resided with him.

148
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,162
Forgive me,
your mother has passed on?

149
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,331
Shortly after our return to England,

150
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,042
she was killed

151
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,546
in a railway accident near Crewe.

152
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,507
My stepfather then
abandoned his attempts

153
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,884
to establish himself in
practice in London

154
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,053
and took us to live
in his ancestral house

155
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,304
at Stoke Moran.

156
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,680
But the money your mother left you

157
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,390
was enough for all your wants,

158
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,101
so that was no obstacle
to your happiness?

159
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:52,189
A terrible change came over
my stepfather,

160
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,024
instead of making friends and
exchanging visits

161
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,776
with our neighbors,

162
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,110
who at first were overjoyed

163
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,905
to see a Roylott back
in the family seat,

164
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,698
he shut himself up in the house

165
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,700
and indulged in ferocious quarrels.

166
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,078
At times it was and still is
hard to keep him out

167
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,121
of the police courts.

168
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,873
He's become the terror of the village.

169
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,458
Does he permit any visitors?

170
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:16,588
No, except my fiancé and
some wandering gypsies.

171
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,090
Gypsies?

172
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,092
Vagabonds, whom he has given leave

173
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,719
to encamp on his land.

174
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:27,015
Sometimes he goes away with them
for days at a time.

175
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,434
You can imagine from what I'm saying

176
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,479
that my poor sister Julia and I

177
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,983
had no great pleasure in our lives.

178
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,860
No servant would stay long

179
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:42,447
so we did all the work of the house.

180
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:46,451
She was but 30 when I lost her,

181
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,745
but already her hair
had begun to whiten,

182
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,998
even as mine has.

183
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,083
Your sister is dead?

184
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,919
Just two years ago.

185
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,255
It is of that I wish to talk to you.

186
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,222
Living the life we did,

187
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,807
we were little likely to see anyone

188
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,144
of our own age and position,

189
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,731
but we were occasionally
allowed short visits.

190
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,399
Two years ago,

191
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,693
Julia met a half-pay major of marines,

192
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,778
to whom she became engaged.

193
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:27,034
Your stepfather approved of the match?

194
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,411
He raised no objection at all.

195
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,832
A fortnight before the wedding,

196
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,751
a terrible event occurred

197
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,504
which deprived me of
my only companion.

198
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:45,093
Pray- be precise as to details.

199
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,971
It is easy,

200
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:53,310
every event of that night is
seared into my memory.

201
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,147
It was late, about 11:00,

202
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,775
Julia had come into my room.

203
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:13,372
He's smoking those awful cigars again.

204
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,375
Perhaps you should have this room
until the wedding.

205
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:32,516
Oh, Helen, oh, I feel so happy.

206
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,103
And yet wretched that I'm
leaving you here alone.

207
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,438
My turn will come.

208
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,108
I shall miss you.

209
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,611
No, you won't, I'll come and stay.

210
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,073
Besides, your major has
promised to find me

211
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,284
a brother officer of equal rank,

212
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:56,373
and infinitely better looking.

213
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:03,755
My darling, what is the matter?

214
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,467
Helen, have you ever
heard anyone whistle

215
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,513
in the dead of night?

216
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:16,268
I suppose you couldn't possibly
whistle yourself, in your sleep?

217
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:20,105
Certainly not, why?

218
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,941
The last few nights,

219
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,694
always about 3:00 in the morning,

220
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,947
I've been woken by a low, clear whistle.

221
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,657
I can't tell where it's coming from.

222
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,160
I thought you might have heard it.

223
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:38,123
I sleep more heavily than you.

224
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:44,463
It was probably those wretched gypsies.

225
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:49,510
Well, never mind.

226
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,612
Was it your custom always

227
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,697
to lock yourself in at night?

228
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,909
Always, my stepfather has a passion

229
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,203
for Indian animals.

230
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,121
A leopard and baboon

231
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,458
wander freely over the grounds.

232
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,544
Julia and I had no feelings of security

233
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,046
unless our doors and windows
were locked.

234
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,970
I couldn't sleep,

235
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:38,058
I had a vague feeling of misfortune.

236
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,942
Julia!

237
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,886
Please help me.

238
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:29,318
Oh, my God, Helen, It was the band...

239
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:35,073
the speckled band.

240
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,408
I'll get father.

241
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,494
No!

242
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,457
Go into your room child,

243
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,251
I'll deal with this.

244
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,240
I am sorry, gentlemen.

245
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:20,202
My sister and I were very close.

246
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,331
Yes indeed.

247
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,042
What a mournful experience.

248
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,258
And you've no idea what
might have caused -

249
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,970
This whistle and metallic sound,

250
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,056
you can swear to it?

251
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,600
It is my strong impression,

252
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,562
I may possibly have been deceived.

253
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,230
Was your sister dressed?

254
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,649
No, she was in her night dress.

255
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,110
Uh, on the floor there was a candle

256
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,320
and the charred stump of a match.

257
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,198
Which means, something must
have woken her up,

258
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:03,787
and she struck a light to see
what the matter was.

259
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,998
What conclusions did
the coroner come to?

260
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,749
He investigated the case
with great care,

261
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,587
but he was unable to find any
satisfactory cause of death.

262
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,338
And your evidence would have shown

263
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,175
that the door was fastened
on the inner side,

264
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,178
the windows blocked by shutters,
secured every night.

265
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,846
It is certain, therefore,

266
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,640
that your sister was alone

267
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,602
when she met her end?

268
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,187
Yes.

269
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,771
Besides, there were no marks

270
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,150
of violence upon her.

271
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,695
What about poison?

272
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:43,243
The doctors examined her for it,
without success.

273
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:50,542
What do you think this unfortunate
lady died of, then?

274
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,544
It's my belief that she died

275
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,507
of pure fear and nervous shock,

276
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,637
though what it was which frightened her
I cannot imagine.

277
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,182
What do you gather from the allusion to
a band, a speckled band?

278
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,060
Delirium.

279
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:13,690
Or some band of people.

280
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,736
The gypsies at the plantation
have spotted

281
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,951
handkerchiefs they wear
around their necks.

282
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:29,581
These are very deep waters.

283
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,001
What happened after
your sister's death?

284
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,921
My life was lonelier than ever

285
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,506
until a month ago,

286
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,424
when a dear friend of mine,

287
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,176
whom I have known for many years,

288
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,846
did me the honor to ask for
my hand in marriage.

289
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,973
His name is Mr. Percy Armitage.

290
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,977
And you are to be married
within a few weeks.

291
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,562
So what prompted you to come here

292
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,106
when your life seems set so fair?

293
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,150
Yesterday, some repairs were started

294
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,236
and my bedroom wall was pierced,

295
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,071
so that last night I was forced

296
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,782
to move into the chamber
in which Julia died,

297
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,200
to sleep in the very bed

298
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,743
in which she slept.

299
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,121
Imagine my terror when
I was woken by the same

300
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,875
low whistle which had been the
herald of her own death.

301
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,293
You lit a lamp?

302
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,628
Yes, but nothing was to be seen.

303
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,213
I was too shaken to sleep.

304
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,882
I dressed and slipped out of the house.

305
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,466
I got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,

306
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,302
and came to London with one objective,

307
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,930
asking your advice.

308
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:31,518
You did wisely.

309
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:35,522
But have you told me all?

310
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,274
Yes.

311
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,862
You have not, Miss Stoner.

312
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:46,658
You are shielding your stepfather.

313
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,536
He is a hard man, but he's still

314
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:53,999
the only father I have known.

315
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,960
I'd say it was time for some breakfast.

316
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,463
There are a thousand details
I desire to know

317
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,715
before I decide on a course of action.

318
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,010
If we were to come to
Stoke Moran today,

319
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,553
could we see over these rooms

320
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,014
without the knowledge
of your stepfather?

321
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,432
As it happens, he spoke of coming

322
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,142
to town today on some business.

323
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,227
And the workmen?

324
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,186
I have seen none.

325
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,938
We have a woman who comes
to clean from the village,

326
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,356
but only in the morning.

327
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,774
There should be nothing to disturb you.

328
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:19,233
Excellent.

329
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,193
Watson, you are not averse
to this trip?

330
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,320
By no means.

331
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,281
Then we will be with you
in the early afternoon.

332
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,200
I shall be there for your arrival.

333
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,705
You'll stay for some breakfast, surely?

334
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,666
Thank you, no.

335
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,590
My heart is lightened already.

336
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:59,982
Ah, Mrs. Hudson, thank you.

337
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:05,028
When you combine the ideas of
whistles at night,

338
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,030
the presence of a band of gypsies

339
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,366
on intimate terms with the doctor,

340
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:14,371
the dying allusion to
a speckled band, well,

341
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,456
there's good ground to believe
that the mystery

342
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,042
may be cleared along those lines.

343
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:28,594
Which one of you is Holmes?

344
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,054
My name, sir;

345
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,849
but you have the advantage of me.

346
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,559
I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott,

347
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:40,147
of Stoke Moran.

348
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:45,235
Indeed, Doctor, please take a seat.

349
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,779
I shall do nothing of the kind.

350
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,531
I know that my stepdaughter

351
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,617
has been here this morning.

352
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,244
What has she been saying to you?

353
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:58,540
It is a little cold for
the time of the year.

354
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,501
What has she been saying to you?

355
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,420
But I have heard that
the crops promise well.

356
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,466
Ah, you put me off, do you?

357
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,676
You scoundrel, sir.

358
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,304
I've heard of you before.

359
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,223
You are Holmes, the meddler,

360
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,474
Holmes the busybody,

361
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:19,478
Holmes, the Scotland Yard
Jack-in-office.

362
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,940
Your conversation really is
most entertaining,

363
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,108
if you would close the door,

364
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:29,488
on your way out,
as there is a decided draft.

365
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,699
I will go when I have said my say.

366
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:35,869
Don't you dare to interfere
in my affairs.

367
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,706
I know that Miss Stoner has been here.

368
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,267
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of.

369
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:10,863
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,
just another client.

370
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:16,201
What a very amiable person.

371
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,829
I may not be quite so bulky, but -

372
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,712
fancy his having the insolence

373
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,507
to confound me with
the official detective force.

374
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:34,803
Ah, this incident gives zest
to our investigation.

375
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,471
I only hope our friend won't suffer

376
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,473
from her imprudence in
allowing that brute

377
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,142
to trace her here.

378
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,436
One thought keeps nagging
at me, Watson,

379
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,189
Roylott's professional life in India,

380
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,607
if it was so successful,

381
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,442
why would he exchange it for a life

382
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,611
of aristocratic penury?

383
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,405
My friend Cooms would know.

384
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,408
Cooms was in Calcutta
around that time.

385
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,868
Find your friend Cooms

386
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,580
and see what you can get from him.

387
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,874
I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons,

388
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,751
where I hope to get some data

389
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,628
which may help us in this matter.

390
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:13,592
Let us meet again at 1:00 under
the clock at Waterloo Station.

391
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,178
That is, if you've finished your
breakfast by then.

392
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,681
Oh, and your revolver,

393
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,808
I would be obliged if you would
slip it into your pocket.

394
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,602
An Eley #2 is an excellent argument

395
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,105
against gentlemen who can
twist steel pokers into knots.

396
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,316
That, and your toothbrush,

397
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,902
are I think all we need.

398
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,407
I've seen the will of
the deceased wife.

399
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,284
Her annual income
at the time of her death

400
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,120
was a little short of 1100 pounds,

401
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,122
but, due to the fall in
agricultural prices,

402
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,750
there's now no more than 750 pounds.

403
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,126
Each girl in case of marriage,

404
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,795
could claim 250 pounds.

405
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,297
So, if both girls had married,
ah, beauty,

406
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:56,635
Grimesby Roylott would have had
a mere pittance.

407
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,472
And even one marriage would ruin him.

408
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,810
The strongest possible motive.

409
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:08,647
Oh, did you manage to find Cooms?

410
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,524
Yes, I did.

411
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,442
He proved rather hard to locate,

412
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,819
but I finally managed

413
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,196
to get him through Swanson at Bards.

414
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,824
He did know Roylott in Calcutta,

415
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:22,369
confirmed what the girl had said,

416
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,955
and added one intriguing fact.

417
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,791
Now, it seems that
a series of robberies

418
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,751
had been perpetrated in his house,

419
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,212
and suspicion fell on
his native butler.

420
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,840
Roylott promptly seized the man,

421
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,383
and in a fit of anger

422
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,428
beat the poor fellow to death,

423
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,097
narrowly escaped a capital sentence,

424
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,433
but suffered a long term
of imprisonment,

425
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,518
and returned to this country

426
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:52,441
a morose and disappointed man.

427
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:58,113
Ah, Watson, it's a wicked world.

428
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:03,202
And when a clever man
turns his brain to crime,

429
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,622
it's the worst of all.

430
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,724
On holiday, are you, gentlemen?

431
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,060
No, we're architects,

432
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,187
taking a look at some of
the local houses.

433
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,065
Ah, that's why you're wanting
Stoke Moran.

434
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,068
I didn't think it was
for social reasons.

435
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:40,364
You'll be, doing business with
Dr. Roylott then?

436
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,075
Yes, I believe that was the name.

437
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,868
If you don't mind a word of warning,

438
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,412
you want to take care with him, sir.

439
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,997
There are some round these parts

440
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,166
say he's not right in the head.

441
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,417
Really?

442
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,504
Only yesterday, Mr. Thorn,
the blacksmith,

443
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:59,049
had a most nasty experience
with the Doctor

444
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,009
because of those thieving gypsies

445
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,428
who are camped in the grounds.

446
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:06,139
Oh, yes, we've heard about the gypsies

447
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,307
and the leopard.

448
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,268
The story goes,

449
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,770
the Doctor threw Mr. Thorn
in the stream

450
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,939
in a fit of uncontrollable temper.

451
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,816
And that Thorn, he's not a small man.

452
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,778
Good Lord, is he bringing a
charge of assault?

453
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,114
He was going to, but Miss Stoner,

454
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,533
the Doctor's young stepdaughter,

455
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:28,620
paid him some of her own money
to keep it quiet.

456
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,247
Well, that's what I heard.

457
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,083
Well, I never.

458
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,835
Did you hear that, Holmes,

459
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,962
the more I see and hear of
that young lady,

460
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,631
the more my admiration increases,

461
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,843
young woman of commendable spirit.

462
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,929
You can pull up here, driver.

463
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,473
Who do you mean?

464
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,809
Well, Miss Stoner, of course,

465
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,603
most admirable.

466
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,646
Ah, Miss Stoner.

467
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,005
Everything worked splendidly.

468
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,381
Dr. Roylott has gone to London

469
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,300
and he won't be back
before the evening.

470
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,927
But we have already had the pleasure

471
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,887
of Dr. Roylott's acquaintance.

472
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,388
Goodness, he followed me?

473
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,891
Yes, he turned up just after you left,

474
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,977
but Holmes sent him off with
a flea in his ear.

475
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,521
He's so cunning, I never know

476
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:37,523
when I'm safe from him.

477
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,650
Well then, he must guard himself,

478
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,693
or he may find someone more cunning

479
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,529
than himself upon his track, shall we.

480
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:46,698
Holmes, don't you think we ought to get

481
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,909
Miss Stoner away from here tonight?

482
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,118
And arouse suspicion?

483
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,537
But if he's violent ...

484
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,539
We shall be here.

485
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,309
So this is Dr. Roylott's room,

486
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,353
this formerly your sister's,

487
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:17,813
and this your room?

488
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,857
Yes, I am now sleeping in this one.

489
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,360
Ah, pending the alterations.

490
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,071
Miss Stoner, may I ask something,

491
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,656
that's unusual, isn't it,

492
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:30,325
bedrooms on the ground floor?

493
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,743
The bedrooms were moved downstairs

494
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,370
when so much of the house
fell into decay.

495
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,665
Oh, yes, of course, how sad.

496
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,588
There seems little need for repairs

497
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,381
to this end of the house.

498
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,133
There are none, I believe it

499
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:49,720
was an excuse to move me from my room.

500
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:54,474
Ah, that is suggestive.

501
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,518
Miss Stoner, would you be so kind

502
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,270
as to go into the room

503
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,022
in which you are now sleeping

504
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:03,066
and bolt the shutters.

505
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:18,040
What are you doing, Watson?

506
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:21,543
Well, I'm using your methods, Holmes,

507
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:25,214
seeing whether the ground
has been disturbed.

508
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,467
And what have you come up with?

509
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,345
Your footprints, I believe,

510
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,431
and mine and Miss Stoner's,

511
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,391
and this.

512
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:07,548
No one could pass these
if they were bolted.

513
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:13,011
Well, let's see if the inside throws
any light on the matter.

514
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,474
Where does that bell
communicate with?

515
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,393
It goes to the housekeeper's room.

516
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,770
It looks newer than the other things.

517
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,356
Yes, it was only put there
a couple of years ago.

518
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,025
Ah, your sister asked for it?

519
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,484
I never heard of her using it.

520
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,071
We used to get what we wanted
for ourselves.

521
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,948
Indeed, you will excuse me

522
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,160
while I satisfy myself as to this floor.

523
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,433
It doesn't ring.

524
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,144
That's very strange.

525
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:02,412
A ventilator into another room.

526
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:06,291
You mean, when it might have

527
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,419
communicated with the outside air?

528
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,171
That is also quite modern.

529
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,423
Indeed.

530
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,968
Miss Stoner, with your permission,

531
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,803
we will now carry our research

532
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:20,681
to Dr. Roylott's chamber.

533
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,163
What's in here?

534
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:45,914
My stepfather's business papers.

535
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,666
Ah, you've seen inside it, then?

536
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,209
Only once, some years ago.

537
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:52,963
I remember it was full of papers.

538
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,841
Is there a cat in there?

539
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,511
No, what a strange idea.

540
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:04,474
Well, look at this!

541
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,810
No, we don't keep a cat.

542
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:11,732
Ah, well, a leopard is a large cat,
after all.

543
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,525
Yes, but a saucer of milk
wouldn't go far

544
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:19,239
in satisfying a leopard.

545
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,784
The leopard is kept on a leash, is it?

546
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:27,247
This sort of leash, Watson?

547
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,541
What do you make of it?

548
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,668
Well, it's a common enough dog leash,

549
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:35,839
but I don't know why it should be tied.

550
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:40,135
We have no dog.

551
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:46,600
Thank you, Miss Stoner,
I have seen enough.

552
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:10,332
I was going to ask if
he'd like some tea.

553
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:14,586
Miss Stoner, it is very essential

554
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:18,215
that you absolutely follow
my advice in every respect.

555
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,551
Your life may depend on it.

556
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,886
I assure you that I'm in your hands.

557
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,763
In the first place,

558
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,516
on the way here we passed
a small cottage.

559
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,934
The shill house.

560
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,602
Will the windows of your sister's room

561
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,229
be visible from there?

562
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,313
Yes.

563
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:34,523
You are sure?

564
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,024
Yes.

565
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,610
Then we shall make it our base.

566
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,279
Some refreshment?

567
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:44,783
We shall have dine shalt we, Holmes?

568
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,369
Is there a village inn?

569
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,537
The Crown.

570
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,746
Oh, good.

571
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,791
Thank you all the same.

572
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,169
Now, Miss Stoner,

573
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,462
when your stepfather returns,

574
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,756
you must confine yourself in your room

575
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,092
on pretense of a headache.

576
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,552
Then when you hear your stepfather

577
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,179
retire for the night,

578
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,763
you must go to the windows,

579
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,224
undo the hasp, open the shutters,

580
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,977
and leave your lamp on the window sill

581
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,687
as a signal to us.

582
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,023
Then withdraw with
anything you may want

583
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,983
for the night to your old room.

584
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,776
I have no doubt that,
in spite of the repairs,

585
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,570
you could manage there for one night.

586
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:24,281
Oh, yes, of course.

587
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,533
And now, we must leave.

588
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:29,703
If Dr. Roylott should return
and find us here,

589
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:33,332
our journey would be in vain.

590
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,791
I believe, Mr. Holmes,

591
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,004
that you've already made up your mind.

592
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,547
For pity sake,

593
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:43,133
tell me the cause of my sister's death.

594
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,885
Be brave.

595
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,470
If you do as I have told you,

596
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,013
rest assured we shall soon drive away

597
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:52,643
the dangers that threaten you.

598
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,501
Yes, it is a clear view.

599
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:40,232
Are you expecting this
to take all night, Holmes?

600
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:47,990
It's possible, anything's possible.

601
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:52,369
When a doctor goes wrong,

602
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:55,747
he is the first of criminals.

603
00:40:55,873 --> 00:41:00,460
He has nerve, he has knowledge,

604
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:04,047
Palmer and Pritchard were among
the heads of their profession,

605
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:09,136
this man strikes even deeper.

606
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:14,725
I really have some scruples
taking you tonight.

607
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,853
There is a distinct element of danger.

608
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:22,983
If I can be of assistance?

609
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:27,196
That's very kind of you.

610
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,748
You evidently saw more in those rooms

611
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:41,126
than was visible to me, Holmes.

612
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:48,258
No, I probably deduced a little more.

613
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,802
Do you remember Miss Stoner said

614
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,513
that her sister could smell

615
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:56,350
Dr. Roylott's cigar?

616
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:57,851
Well?

617
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,854
The ventilator, a ventilator made,

618
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:06,193
a cord hung, and a woman
who lies in the bed, dies.

619
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,946
I can't see any connection.

620
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:16,370
Did you notice anything peculiar
about the bed?

621
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:20,165
It was clamped to the floor.

622
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,002
It could not be moved,
had to remain in the same

623
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:30,008
relative position to
the ventilator and the rope,

624
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:33,887
or so we may call it,
since it was clearly

625
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:40,811
never made for a bell pull.

626
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:45,732
I begin to see dimly
what you're driving at.

627
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:48,610
We're only just in time to prevent some

628
00:42:48,694 --> 00:43:00,330
subtle and horrible crime.

629
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:12,009
Whoah, boy.

630
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,727
Goodnight.

631
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,990
Did you have a good day?

632
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:25,332
Not without interest.

633
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:29,127
Where did you get to this morning?

634
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:33,549
I decided to go to town, too.

635
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:39,805
I had some shopping to do
for the wedding.

636
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:42,933
You knew I was going up,

637
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:46,979
we might have traveled together.

638
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,815
I left early.

639
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:53,986
Yes, I know you did.

640
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:56,572
So that I should be back by lunchtime,

641
00:44:56,697 --> 00:45:01,326
I had some things to do here
this afternoon.

642
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:07,958
My trip was a whim.

643
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:17,050
You always were a good little liar.

644
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:23,390
If you'll excuse me,
I have a terrible headache.

645
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:30,939
Holmes, the meddler, Holmes,
the busybody,

646
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:38,030
Holmes, the Scotland Yard
Jack-in-office.

647
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,485
The signal.

648
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,353
My God, what's that?

649
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,814
It's the baboon.

650
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:57,943
This is a nice household.

651
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:27,598
We must sit without light.

652
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,371
Do not fall asleep;

653
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:55,959
your very life may depend upon it.

654
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:54,745
You see it, Watson, you see it?

655
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:10,802
What can it mean?

656
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:13,805
It means it is over,

657
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,808
and perhaps, for the best.

658
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:20,646
Come Watson, bring your pistol.

659
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:41,291
It's the band, the speckled band,

660
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,669
it is a swamp adder,

661
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:47,005
the deadliest snake in India.

662
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:50,467
He has died within seconds
of being bitten.

663
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,347
Violence does, in truth,

664
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,933
recoil upon the violent,

665
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,936
and the schemer falls into the pit

666
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,481
which he digs for another.

667
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,943
The idea of a snake occurred to me

668
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:51,737
when I coupled it with the knowledge

669
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,447
that the Doctor was furnished

670
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:55,407
with a supply of creatures from India.

671
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:57,951
A form of poison, rapid and lethal.

672
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,411
Which couldn't possibly be discovered

673
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:01,914
by any chemical test.

674
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:04,041
It might, or might not bite

675
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,959
the occupant of the bed.

676
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:08,045
She might escape every night
for a week,

677
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,713
but sooner or later,

678
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,341
she must fall a victim.

679
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:16,720
Oh, my poor Julia.

680
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,515
The Doctor had trained the snake,

681
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,183
probably with the milk,

682
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,602
to return at the sound of a whistle,

683
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:24,895
the very whistle

684
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:28,065
which you and your late sister heard.

685
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,483
My inspection of the chair

686
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,276
in Dr. Roylott's room had shown that he

687
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,195
had been in the habit of
standing upon it

688
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,656
to reach the ventilator.

689
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,533
Last night when I attacked the snake

690
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:39,660
and drove it back
through the ventilator,

691
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:41,620
I roused its snakish temper,

692
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,330
causing it to turn upon

693
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,874
the next person that it saw.

694
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:49,211
Dr. Grimesby Roylott.

695
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,129
So you, Holmes,

696
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:52,798
were indirectly responsible

697
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:55,801
for his death.

698
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:58,136
I cannot say that it is likely

699
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:02,266
to weigh very heavily on my conscience.
