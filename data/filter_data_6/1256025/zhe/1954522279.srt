00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,280
* Like I did that day *
* 如那天般的感受 *

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,750
* Take me to the place I love *
* 带我去我爱的地方 *

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,840
* Take me all the way *
* 带我一路走 *

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,490
* I don't ever want to feel *
* 我再也不想有 *

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,680
* Like I did that day *
* 如那天般的感受 *

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,910
* Take me to the place I lo...*
* 带我去我爱的地...*

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,460
Fellas, please.
伙计们 消停点儿吧

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,090
Penny, come on. We were
just finding our sound.
算了吧 Penny 我们刚开始唱呢

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,610
You found it. It's the sound of a
cat being run over by a lawn mower.
你自己听听吧 不知道的还以为
哪只猫被卷进割草机里了呢

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm really very busy.
我真的很忙

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,510
Is there any way that we can put this
off until I have more time to prepare?
我们能否推迟一下?
我好有点时间来准备

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,190
Of course. But, uh, you
understand my trepidation.
当然了 可... 你知道我有些啥顾虑

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.
- 他又在干嘛?
- 毫无头绪

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,620
Can't we just postpone
it till the spring?
就不能推迟到开春吗?

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,030
Maybe next summer?
或者明年夏天?

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,100
This should be fairly easy to deduce.
这个应该很好推断的

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,290
He's holding the phone to his left ear.
他把电话搁在左耳旁边

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,880
Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the
analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain,
左耳还是左脑控制的
所以他是在理性分析而不是感情用事

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,380
suggesting that he has no personal
relationship with the caller.
表明他和来电者没有私人关系

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,570
No, I didn't realize
it had been so long.
不 我没想到已经这么久了

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,210
Sure, I guess there's no other
choice but to just go ahead and do it.
好吧 那就只好这么办了

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,290
He's referring to an
activity he has done before.
他谈到了一件以前做过的事

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,780
It's unpleasant and
needs to be repeated.
那件事不怎么令人愉快
但又不得不再来一遍

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,310
This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
表明这件事应该是某种侵入性
医疗检查 比如说 结肠镜检查

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,080
Aren't there any other options?
就没有其他选择了么?

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,320
There's not a lot of room.
It's gonna be uncomfortable.
没多大地方 肯定很不舒服的

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,910
Yes, yes.
没错 没错

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,410
I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.
我敢肯定是结肠镜检查

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,010
Okay, bye.
好吧 再见

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,700
My mother's coming to visit.
我妈要来看我

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,200
How about that, you were right.
听听 你说得没错啊

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,230
It's out of order.
电梯坏了

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,270
Yes, I can read the sign. I'm
just pondering the implications.
嗯 我识字的 我只是在沉思
其背后的深意

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,080
I think it implies that
the elevator doesn't work.
我觉得这意味着电梯不工作了

39
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,090
Again, I can read the sign.
再说一遍 我识字的

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,470
But the sign and the tape are
coated with a layer of dust,
不过标签和胶带上都有厚厚一层灰了

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,740
which indicates that the elevator has been
nonfunctional for a significant amount of time.
这表示电梯已经坏了
有相当长的一段时间了

42
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,240
Which suggests either a
remarkable passivity among the,
也就暗示着这栋大楼里的

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,220
I assume, 24 to 36
residents of this building,
大约24到36位居民十分不主动

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,530
based on the number of mailboxes and
given typical urban population density
噢 居民数我是从邮箱的数目以及
普通城镇人口密度推断出来的

45
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,290
or a shared delusion of functionality.
或者说这些人都有功能性错觉

46
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,050
You must be Leonard's mother.
你一定是Leonard他母亲

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,830
Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.

Uh, why don't you come with me.
I'll walk you to the apartment.
你跟我一起走吧 我带你去他们房间

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,060
Oh, all right. Would you like to
exchange pleasantries on the way?
噢 好啊 路上咱先寒暄寒暄吧?

54

- All right, you start.
- 嗯 好啊

Okay. You know, I've
always been curious.

What was Leonard like
when he was little?

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,370
Oh, I think you mean young.
He's always been little.
噢 我想你是指他年轻的时候
他一直都是个小不点儿

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,960
Right, okay. What was he
like when he was young?
没错 他年轻的时候是什么样的?

59
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,100
You'll have to be more specific.
你得再说具体点儿

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,900
Um, okay, like, five or six.
呃... 好吧 比如说 五六岁的时候

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,620
Five.
五岁

62
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,800
Oh, well, at that age, he was well enmeshed in what Freud
would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development.
那时他正深陷于弗洛伊德所谓的
心理性发展之生殖器崇拜阶段

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,990
An outmoded theory, of course, but the
boy did spend most of his waking hours
当然是个过时的理论了
不过那孩子确实在大部分醒着的时候

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,620
with a tight grasp on his penis.
牢牢地抓住自己的小弟弟不放

65
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,930
Yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.
是啊 Leonard说起过 你是个精神病学家

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Well, that is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.
那只是其中一个学位罢了
我主要涉及的领域是神经系统学

67
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,630
Well, I'm an actress.
我是个演员

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,250
Why?

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,390
What do you mean why?
什么叫为什么?

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,350
Well, there are studies
that suggest that many
有研究表明

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,360
who go into the performing arts suffer
from an external locus of identity.
许多演艺界的人士都有外控性格

72
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
我不知道你在说什么

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,280
Well, it means you value
yourself only as others value you,
是说当别人重视你时 你才会重视自己

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,340
which is often the result of
unmet childhood emotional needs.
通常是童年未满足的情感需求导致的

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,360
Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
噢 我的童年可了不得了

76
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,890

I know my dad wanted a boy.
我知道老爸想要个儿子

sports, but I hated getting dirty!
我... 我努力让自己变成体育健将
可我真的讨厌把自己弄脏!

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,450
And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.
然后 我想你进入了青春期

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
He called me Slugger until
I got my first training bra.
在我得到第一件运动内衣之前
他都管我叫"重击手"来着

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,340
And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.
之后他就不和我玩传接球了

82
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,010
I wasn't Slugger anymore.
我再也不是"重击手"了

83

Your mother's here!
你妈妈来了!

如果你想和那个姑娘上床

*******developed sex drive.
我的看法是他无法集中精力
是因为过度发达的性冲动造成的

Oh, I don't know where
he would've gotten that.
他怎么会有那玩意儿

99

Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,

his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.

That seems a fairly
efficient arrangement.

Yes, we think so. We've
both done papers on it.
是啊 我们也这么想

view and his from an anthropological.

fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.

更年期征兆

Yeah, I-I thought you

I envy you your childhood.

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,420
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories
I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
不想这么说 但我童年时期唯一
温暖的记忆都是来自我Floyd叔叔

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,980
You're clearly misremembering.
你很显然记错了

128
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,070
Your mother is brilliant,
analytical, insightful.
你妈妈太有才了 既有分析能力
又富有洞察力

129
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,190
And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible
because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
而且我打赌她不会因为
你不吃芽甘蓝 就用圣经来打你

130
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,720
Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.
Sheldon 你太不会欣赏你妈妈了

131
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,610
She's warm, she's loving,
她很温暖 她很慈爱

132
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,450
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to
measure your brain waves while potty training.
不会在你学用婴儿便盆时
就把电极粘到你头上来测脑电波

133
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,730
You were lucky.When I was
a kid, if I wanted an EEG,
够有福了 我小的时候
要是想做脑电图

134
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,730
I had to attach my own electrodes.
我还得自己接电极

135
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,160
So, Dr.Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about
his incredibly successful brother and sister.
Hofstadter博士 Lenoard很少谈起
他格外成功的兄弟姐妹

136
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,570
Please, don't go there, Howard.
求你 别说起这个 Howard

137
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,900
I understand that, unlike Leonard, they're
at the top of their respective fields.
我知道 不像Lenoard
他们在各自的领域里是尖子

138
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,830
Boy, you suck.
