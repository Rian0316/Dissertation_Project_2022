1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,800
You!
Another beer.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,599
This one taste like monkey sweat.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,379
Please!

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,459
What?!
You lecture me in manners?

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,479
You, dressed like prostitute!

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
Eh! It's six o'clock in the morning.
I want my breakfast.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,680
Can we just get on
with the game, please?

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,240
Come on, then, little boy,
make your bloody move.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,080
Yeah, all right.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,560
I'll call you five grand.

11
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:47,720
Let's see what you got.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,399
Hang on a minute.
I've been looking at you all night.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,919
I'm flattered.
You're not really my type, love.

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,959
Trying to work out why I knew
your face, and it's just come to me.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,079
Oh, yeah?

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,279
I think you're Kennedy.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,160
The card counter.
I think you're Sean Kennedy.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,600
Security!

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,879
ALARM

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,160
Argh!

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
Kensington.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,080
Stop!

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,840
When will you be free?
I need to cash these chips.

24
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:00,879
I can't exactly go
back in the casino.

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,840
Well, well, well,
what have we here!

26
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:04,679
I'll call you back.

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,839
Five bloody grand you took off me.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,639
I want my money, you cheating
pig, or I call the police!

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,719
Look, ok, ok, ok.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,879
Look, mate, that's
only fair, all right?

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,239
Five grand, yeah?

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,120
There you go.
Sorry about that.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
You want to cash the chips?

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
I'll do it.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,740
I'll give you cash
for them, right now.

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,219
- How much?
- How much you got in there?

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,239
About 40K's worth.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,719
I'll give you ten.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,879
LAUGHS
You're having a laugh, mate!

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,199
- 15.
- No chance...

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,279
20, final offer.
20 grand cash, right now.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,079
You make a bit, I make a bit.
What's not to like?

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,920
What's not to like?

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,760
I'd like to cash these, please.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,719
- Is this a joke?
- What?

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,239
I'm not cashing these.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,639
What do you mean you're
not cashing them? Why?

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,439
Well why d'you think?
They're fake.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Obviously they're fake.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,679
I think you're Kennedy.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,479
The card counter.
I think you're Sean Kennedy.

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
Security!

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
Kensington.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
20 grand cash, right now.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,760
You make a bit, I make a bit.
What's not to like?

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,879
What's not to like?

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
Argh!

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,039
Listen, cheers, Caz. You played
an absolute blinder as usual.

59
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,418
Thanks, babe.
Really sweet of you, that.

60
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,919
Sure we can't give
you a lift anywhere?

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,519
No thanks, Ash.
Not feeling too clever, to be honest.

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,760
I could do with a bit of a walk
and some fresh...

63
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,880
Whoa... Ooh!

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
Ambulance.

You're going to be fine, love.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,799
Tough as old boots, you are.
Less of the "old".

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,719
Yeah, well, you know what I mean.
I don't want to die, Ash.

69
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No-one's doing any dying.

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,359
Besides, there's a queue.
And Albert's first.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Charming!

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,559
You're going to be fine, yeah?

73
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll come back
with a bunch of grapes.

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,639
Are you next of kin?

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,839
Well, as good as.
There's no-one else.

76
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,800
Your friend's had a
very serious heart

77
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,759
attack and she'll be
in for quite a while.

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,359
Now, she's going to need
some stuff from home.

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
Is there any way you'll
be able to sort that out?

80
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
consider it done.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,400
Heart attack?

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,079
All right, thanks for
letting me know, Sandra.

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,839
Yeah, I know it couldn't
have been an easy call.

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,200
Right, thanks again.
Bye-bye.

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,920
Poor old girl.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,519
I'll have a whiskey,
Eddie, large one.

87
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,559
I know how you feel, mate.
I might join you there.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,479
Very upsetting news.

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,679
- You already heard?
- Yeah, Ash phoned me.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,359
Well, I suppose it wasn't
a surprise to anyone.

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,039
She just went down
like a sack of potatoes.

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,479
It's awful.

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,000
In the end, they had no
option but to put her down.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,319
They shot Carol?

95
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,639
No! El Matador,
at 10.30 at Chepstow.

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,519
I'm talking about Carol.

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh! Carol is recovering
in the hospital.

98
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,079
And unless the NHS is in
more trouble than I thought,

99
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,519
I don't believe they're
planning on murdering her.

100
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,519
Right. Good, cos...

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,399
yeah, she's er... she's a...
she's a lovely lady, Carol.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,999
Remember the
Downing Street switch?

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,319
- What, that was Carol?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,039
- And the London Eye float.
- Yeah?

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,839
The bearer bond scam of 2000.
All hers.

106
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,160
She even...she even
took Mad Frankie Fraser

107
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:49,479
for ten quid when she
was five years old.

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
(No!)

109
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,399
Yeah, in her day...

110
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,359
Carol was one of the best.

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,759
So there's no fella
on the scene, then?

112
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,919
Not if this is anything to go by.

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,159
Whoa! Now that is what
I call comfort food.

114
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,460
No wonder she's not well.

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
What the hell...

116
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
"Eat Yourself Slender"?
Now, this I've got to see.

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,839
'Hey, I'm Dr Dean Deville,

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,679

Carol had been on the
diet for six months.

stone when she started,

13 when admitted to
hospital this morning.

151
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,799
And if you read these,
you can see why.

152
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,919
It is a recipe for heart disease, high
blood pressure, raised cholesterol.

153
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,959
It'd be funny if it
wasn't so dangerous.

154
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,759
Meanwhile, Dr Dean Deville and
his wife and business partner Dana

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,479
have gained quite a few pounds
over the last few years.

156
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
Yeah, over ten million of them,
according to Companies House.

157
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,479
Please tell me we think they
can afford to shed a few.

158
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,919
They sold Carol a diet plan
that nearly killed her.

159
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,679
I think we should take them
for everything we can.

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,199
Yeah, definitely.
Oh, yes.

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,999
OK. Good.
So, who are they?

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,239
Albert... history. Where did they come
from and why did they leave America?

163
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,520
Emma, check out their
business interests and

164
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,799
anything else they may
be involved in. Mm-hm.

165
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,919
Sean, check out the science.
Their labs and qualifications.

166
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,079
I'll do hobbies and
personal interests.

167
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Ash, the legal implications.

168
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,159
How the hell do they manage
to keep selling a product

169
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,199
that is clearly so dangerous.
Right? Let's do this.

170
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,359
'I'm Dr Dean Deville...
Dr Dean Deville...

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
Dean and Dana Deville.
Oh, these guys are pros.

173
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
They've been doing what
they've been doing

174
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,599
in one form or another
over the years.

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,559
They always manage to stay
just one step ahead of the law.

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,679
'With Pro-Butrimol-F and active
vita-beta-retinal 5 action,

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,719
'this is probably the best vitamin
in the world ever, ever.'

178
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,479
In 2005, they moved
onto the internet

179
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,039
and became the king and
queen of the infomercial.

180
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,359
'Just £9.99 is all
it'll cost to end

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,760
the pain of arthritis
forever, forever.

182
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
'And say goodbye to swine
flu misery with Pig-U-Go.'

183
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,319
There's no evidence to suggest
any products they sell

184
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,159
have had scientific testing.

185
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,119
And as far as qualifications
are concerned, well,

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,159
they're from a mail
order place in Tupelo.

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,559
Dr Pepper is more
qualified than these two.

188
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,039
They circumvent any legal issues
arising from this by selling them

189
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,279
as health supplements and like Albert
said, always just getting away with it.

190
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,039
Last year, they made
profits of over £2 million

191
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,039
getting away with it. Most of this,
it's invested in art purchases

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,199
which they store in safety deposits,

193
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,999
to sell for profit at a later date.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,799
It looks like they have
an interest in art,

195
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,359
but it's done purely
for financial gain.

196
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,639
So I think it's pretty clear
that the accumulation of money

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,019
is their main hobby, but
what's their weakness?

198
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,639
- Arrogance. They think
they're untouchable. - Yes.

199
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,639
But the UK's much more strictly
regulated than the States...

200
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,140
it must be getting harder for
them to stay one step ahead

201
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:34,271
of the authorities.
So, I mean if you were them,

202
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,199
wouldn't you be looking
for a way out now?

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,479
A way to find the big one,
the ultimate, that one last

204
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,759
legitimate product that
would allow you to retire?

205
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,599
- So that's what we offer them?
- Yes. And we use their arrogance,

206
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,359
this feeling they can do anything,
to blind them to what we're doing.

207
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,359
So what's the actual con?

208
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
We are going to sell them

209
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,899
a genuine wonder product that
will make them billions.

210
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,599
Which is?

211
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,439
MOCK AMERICAN ACCENT: Which is the
best diet drug in the world ever!

212
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,359
All right, so what's the convincer?

213
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,679
Yes, these people are scammers
themselves. And pretty good ones.

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,119
They'll spot an ordinary
convincer a mile off.

215
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,679
So in order to outsmart them,
we'll have to be very clever.

216
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,639
Who's heard of the Montagne scam?

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,679
The guy that stole
the Venus de Milo.

218
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,159
Yeah, and more importantly,
sold it again.

219
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,679
So, our convincer, we are going
to sell the Devilles this.

220
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,839
The Lucien egg, one of a
pair of Faberge eggs,

221
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,839
and this one is currently residing
at the Tenguiz Gallery.

222
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
- Who owns the other one?
- The Devilles do.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,759
The eggs together are worth much
more than the sum of their parts,

224
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,239
so unsurprisingly, the Devilles
have made repeated attempts

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,239
to buy the Lucien egg, but Josh
Tenguiz simply isn't interested.

226
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,599
They also tried to sell him their
egg at a grossly inflated amount

227
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,319
- but still, no deal.
- So?

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,380
A few years ago, the
Devilles were interviewed

229
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,439
by police in connection
to the purchase

230
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,879
and profitable sale
of some stolen artwork.

231
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,999
They claimed they did it in good
faith and there were no charges.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,319
I think the jury's still out
on that one but I think it's safe

233
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,999
to say these people would stop
at nothing to snaffle up a bargain.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,399
So Emma, Sean, I want you to check
out security at the Tenguiz Gallery.

235
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,199
Ash, we'll go and see an old friend
of mine. Albert, Dali Macmanus.

236
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,479
Wherever he is, whoever he is these
days, I need you to find him.

237
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,399
And one last thing...
We can't rush this.

238
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,879
To draw these people in
successfully, we need time,

239
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,879
so be patient and remember that
revenge is a dish best served cold.

240
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,640
Freddy the Face,
long time no see.

241
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,359
Hello?
No, I can't talk right now.

242
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,599
No, I'm going into the gallery.
No, I should be quick.

243
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
OK, hold on...

244
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,600
Cheers, darling.

245
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,880
- Well, I'm done, you ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

246
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,799
Oh, my goodness. Excuse me, somebody!
This is something bad here!

247
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,639
There's something bad
here in this bag.

248
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,960
Evacuate the gallery as
quickly as possible!

249
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
Come on!

250
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,480
ALARM RINGS

251
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,839
If we're thinking of trying to
steal this egg, we're in trouble.

252
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,739
Why?

253
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,199
Because everyone of the
exhibits in this gallery

254
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,999
is coated with an invisible chemical.

255
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,079
A chemical which reacts to an infra
red light if taken through any

256
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,519
of the 56 internal doors
and sets off the alarms.

257
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,119
- Basically, we're buggered.
- We're buggered.

258
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,399
Excellent.

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,560
DOOR BUZZER GOES

260
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,119
That'll be the pizza.
Could you get that please, Sean?

261
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Yeah, don't worry about it,
I'll get it.

262
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,720
Just push the door mate.

263
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,399
Oh, my gawd, I'm gonna have
a bleedin' 'eart attack!

264
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,119
What's the matter, lift broken?

265
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,519
Nah, it's not the lifts mate,
no, I'm just a fat git.

266
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,640
Glutton dressed as glam.
What d'you think?

267
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,159
Oh, my God!

268
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,359
So over the whole time
we set up the convincer,

269
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,679
me and Mickey will be in weekly
contact with the Devilles.

270
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,640
But each time we meet,
Freddy the Face will

271
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,599
have fitted me with
a smaller fat suit.

272
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,519
So by the time the convincer's over,
I'll appear to have lost six stone

273
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,840
in as many weeks and they
will want to know how.

274
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,479
- What?
- It's scary how well you carry it off.

275
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,320
Yeah. Sure you don't want
a bit of salad now?

276
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,119
PHONE RINGS

277
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,559
- Hey, Em. - The Devilles are
attending an art launch at three.

278
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,400
- Oh, that's fine. We'll see you there.
- Bye.

279
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,799
Do you think we can make
some money out of this one?

280
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,000
You never know.

281
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,000
- Another glass?
- It's free. Of course.

282
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,199
- Five seconds.
- Got it.

283
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,319
It's Balloon Cat,
Mr Branson, yes,

284
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,159
and Jeff Koons is hotter
than ever right now.

285
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,519
I think it's a steal at half a
million, if you'll pardon the pun.

286
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,000
A painting like that would be
worth ten times that at auction.

287
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah, I can talk to you later.
OK, bye.

288
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,359
- Excuse me, did we meet?
- I don't think so.

289
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,439
Dana Deville, Doctor.

290
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,799
Danny Mullen, dealer.

291
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,340
Oh, you're a dealer?
You got a card? My husband and I

292
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,879
are always on the lookout
for exciting new pieces.

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,480
I think I may have one.
Here, there we go.

294
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,439
"If you don't ask, you don't get".

295
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,679
- And what does that mean?
- Exactly what it says.

296
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,159
On the face of it, some pieces
may seem tricky to source.

297
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,079
But I say, I definitely can't
help you if you don't ask.

298
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,439
But if you do ask, you get?

299
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,879
I haven't failed yet.

300
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,519
What, ever?

301
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,439
Nope.

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,879
What if I asked you for something
that wasn't even for sale?

303
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,400
As I said, I haven't failed yet.

304
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,840
- Did she bite?
- I don't know.

305
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,099
The Koons that was stolen from
Madrid last month?

306
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,559
- The what?
- The Koons, from L'Escuela.

307
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,200
It was an early one,
worth maybe a million.

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Well, I think that might just
have been the man who stole it.

309
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,039
Then there was Jessica,
my uncle's missus,

310
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,079
she was fit as a fiddle.

311
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,559
Bang, massive heart attack -
dead before she hit the ground.

312
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,080
Oh.

313
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,159
You know, erm, it's really nice
of you to come and see me, Eddie.

314
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,120
I hope you don't think
I'm being rude

315
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,159
but do you think there's any way
we can talk about something

316
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,999
other than premature death
from coronary heart disease?

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,239
Oh. Oh, 'course.
Sorry.

318
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,040
Stupid of me.
I'm sorry, Carol.

319
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,639
How about deaths from cancer?

320
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
Same, really.
Yeah.

321
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,479
Go on then,
what's your favourite?

322
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,559
Hey, now you're talking.

323
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,159
You know when I was a little girl,
it was the pink donuts, deffo,

324
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,000
but you know when you get a bit older,
it's the blue ones you like...

325
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,119
Well, this man's clearly
a player in the art world.

326
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,999
Clearly.

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,119
OK, hand me his card.

328
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,519
We're going to have to meet.

329
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,039
And I said, "Belushi,
you keep taking that crap,

330
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,799
"it ain't gonna do you no good."

331
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,559
The very next day, he was dead,

332
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,399
and I took that as a sign.

333
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,380
What sort of a sign?

334
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,680
Primarily that he was
sicker than I thought.

335
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,339
And also that I had a gift and it
was my duty to share that gift

336
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,119
and bring wellbeing and healing
and happiness to others.

337
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,920
And that's when
you joined the CIA?

338
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,919
Five years black ops and the
extraordinary thing is that...

339
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,559
Oh, enough of you, my sweet!

340
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,679
I think our guest is
a very busy man so

341
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,359
let's cut to the chase, shall we?

342
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,359
All right.
Fine by me.

343
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,320
Mr Mullen, have you heard of a
Faberge egg called the Laurentian?

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,279
Hmm... 19th century,
it's not really my speciality.

345
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,439
Well, we own it, it's one of a pair.

346
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,079
The other's called the Lucien Egg
and it's in the Tenguiz Gallery.

347
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,799
Now they were conceived as a
pair, they were made as a pair.

348
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,719
And I'd imagine worth a
whole lot more as a pair.

349
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,759
Great minds, Mr Mullen,
great minds.

350
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,959
Except that we've approached the
owner on a number of occasions

351
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,440
to buy the egg and he refuses.

352
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:14,759
Drivels on about its aesthetic beauty,

353
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,199
how it makes him feel
alive just to hold it

354
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
and we've run out of patience now.

355
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,199
And so, as requested, we've got
four words for you, Mullens.

356
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,639
Four simple words that
require one simple answer.

357
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,879
Can. You. Acquire. The...

358
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,519
Sorry, five words.

359
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,039
Can you get us the egg?

360
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,719
Well, if we already know that
Tenguiz won't sell it to you,

361
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,479
there really is only one
way of obtaining it.

362
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,920
Indeed.

363
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,879
OK.

364
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,199
As I say, this isn't really my area,

365
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,399
so I'm guessing that
each egg on its own is worth

366
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,039
maybe a quarter of a million?

367
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,639
As a pair, maybe three quarters?

368
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,839
The Tenguiz is a very secure
gallery. It would take organising,

369
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,680
which is expensive. I have a team
of trusted experts I always use.

370
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,399
I'd want 50K, cash on delivery.

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,239
Do you know who we are, Mr Mullen?

372
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,319
Of course, I always do my research.

373
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,279
Then you'll know we're
successful business people,

374
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,159
who did not get where they are
by being taken for fools.

375
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,599
And believe me, I have
serious respect for that.

376
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,799
But I'd need to know you trust
me or this won't work at all.

377
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,399
Now, excuse me,
I'm late for my next meeting.

378
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,479
We're not saying we don't trust you.

379
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,319
OK, how's this?
I'll involve you in the planning.

380
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,879
But this will take
some time to organise.

381
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,999
So, we'll have regular briefings,
updates, at yours, at mine,

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,559
wherever you want.

383
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,199
If you don't like something and you
have a better idea, we'll change it.

384
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,960
What do you think?

385
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,800
Weekly briefings.
You'll thank us for our input.

386
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,719
Then I think we have a deal.

387
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,920
I think we do.

388
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,960
You won't regret it.
I'll be in touch.

389
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,639
What time do you call this?

390
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm sorry but I got held up.

391
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,360
Stop with the excuses.

392
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,039
Three quarters of a mil?
More like two.

393
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,399
Nearly £2 million profit!

394
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,880
The best art theft deal
in the world. Ever!

395
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,360
'There are four types of fat.

396
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:53,279
'Good fat, bad fat,
thin fat and fat fat.'

397
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,359
When setting up the convincer, Ash
and I will be in weekly contact

398
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,639
with the Devilles,
but when we meet them,

399
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,799
Freddy The Face will have
fitted Ash with a smaller fat suit.

400
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,940
So by the time the
convincer is over, he'll

401
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,079
appear to have lost six
stone in as many weeks.

402
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,359
'I'm Doctor Dean Deville,
I'm Doctor Dean Deville,

403
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,319
'and I'm here to tell you
about the EYS plan.'

404
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,039
The stakes are high.

405
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,720
Breaking into The Tenguiz Gallery
to get the egg is a tall order.

406
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,640
OK, that's how you get in.

407
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,079
'You, too, can be part of the
Eat Yourself Slender Plan.'

408
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,439
So, the chemical the
objects are sprayed with

409
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,799
is called Aceto-Styteline.

410
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,359
It reacts with the infra-red on
the doors and sets the alarms off.

411
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,279
But if you subject Styteline to a
15-nanosecond blast of black light...

412
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,000
It temporarily changes
its refractive index.

413
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
SHE GASPS

414
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,399
'The Eat Yourself Slender Plan lets
you eat the good, thin fat you like,

415
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,280
'whilst at the same time
reducing your bad fat fat.'

416
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,639
See you soon.

417
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
THEY LAUGH

418
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,600
I got to change my lens prescription.

419
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,079
Through the ducts
is the best way to get in.

420
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,320
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

421
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,119
Er, sorry, here are the, er...

422
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,559
Ah, good. Good. Now,
this is what we were missing.

423
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,239
'The Eat Yourself Slender Plan!

424
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
'Because the rest of
your life starts today.'

425
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,839
- You sure you're ready for
the break-in? - Yeah. 100%.

426
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,639
See you at the penthouse
tomorrow, eight o'clock, sharp.

427
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,960
We'll supply the popcorn.

428
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,959
My team should be arriving
at the gallery now.

429
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,159
They know this has to
go like clockwork.

430
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,079
- There you go.
- Thank you.

431
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,399
- Champagne?
- Thanks.

432
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
Please, have a seat.

433
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,519
Sailing bloody close to the wind,
bringing them in here.

434
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,800
The nearer we draw them to us, the more
they'll trust us. According to Mickey.

435
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,519
Ah, this is Claude. He takes
care of all our security concerns.

436
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,880
Ah, the old "in and out" guy, huh?

437
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,040
OK, we're in.

438
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,280
There they are.

439
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,120
Right.

440
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,600
OK. Let's do it.

441
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,279
OK, I'm here.

442
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,359
OK, cameras 19 and 24
will freeze when I press enter.

443
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,799
But the system's on an automatic
reboot every three minutes,

444
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,080
which I can't override.

445
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:45,040
'So, you have exactly 180 seconds
from when I say, OK?'

446
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
And, go!

447
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
Here comes the black light now.

448
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,119
Come on, come on.

449
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,259
How much longer does he have?

450
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,720
45 seconds.
Come on, fella, come on.

451
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,679
Now the moment of truth.

452
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,720
The black light should
block the security alarm.

453
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,559
Wow. Ha!
It actually worked.

454
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
What did I say?

455
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,800
Come on, Sean.

456
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,799
Eight, seven...

457
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,720
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

458
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,360
Uh! Ha!

459
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Nice one!

460
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,999
So, give us 24 hours, let the dust
settle, and we'll meet up tomorrow.

461
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,119
- You know, Mullen, Bill Clinton
once said to me... - Shut up, Dean.

462
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,519
- No, Bill never said that.
- Goodnight, Mr Mullen.

463
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,960
Goodnight!

464
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,240
Softly, softly.

465
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,639
I bet you haven't seen
one this big before.

466
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,079
I don't think I have. And what
a funny colour, innit, it's just...

467
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,599
Can I have a quick word
please, sir?

468
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,840
Yeah, sure, yeah.

469
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,559
You like Carol, don't you?

470
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,639
Yeah, well, I do a bit,
yeah. Y'know.

471
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,999
She'll be ready to leave in a few
days. And she'll need someone.

472
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,879
To help her change her lifestyle,

473
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,679
to help her lose weight
and get fit again.

474
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,359
And I was just wondering that,
if you did it together

475
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,120
you might find that you wouldn't need
all the cakes and the sweets and...

476
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,039
As you can see, it's got
a time and a date on it.

477
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,799
So I'm hoping that'll reveal
who paid for five coffees,

478
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,200
four flapjacks and a croissant
here, Thursday last.

479
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,160
Beautiful, isn't it?

480
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,399
I think you and I could do a lot
more business together, Mr Mullen.

481
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,759
I very much hope so.

482
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,239
We will most definitely be in touch.

483
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,799
Oh, and remember...

484
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,799
TOGETHER: "If you don't ask..."

485
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
THEY LAUGH

486
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,319
What do you feed
your staff on, Mr Mullen?

487
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,279
I'm sorry?

488
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,719
Buddy, you're either on a hell of
a diet or you have terminal cancer.

489
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,799
Oh. You're right.
He has lost some weight.

490
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,958
Six stone, actually.

491
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,840
- What did you say?
- In as many weeks.

492
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:06,279
Six stone in six weeks?
How?

493
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,759
- Oh, no, that's private.
- Oh. Don't be like that.

494
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,759
You wouldn't want to make
little Dana cross, would you?

495
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Weight loss is our business.

496
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,199
It's a new diet drink.

497
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,239
A diet drink?

498
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,239
Yeah.
Just one spoonful, and bingo.

499
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,719
What diet drink? Where did
you get it, this diet drink?

500
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,399
How come I haven't heard
about this new diet drink?

501
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,479
Tell me, or you'll be losing
a couple more ounces right here.

502
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,599
Cos it's not for sale.

503
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,519
Er, cos it's still being tested.

504
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,040
Cos I sort of... nicked it.

505
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,479
My missus works as a lab
assistant for Spitz-Kleinman.

506
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,639
They're a pharmaceutical company.

507
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,840
We know who they are.

508
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:53,319
Yeah, and occasionally she'd bring
some of her work home with her.

509
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,439
Anyway, she was talking about
this new weight-loss product

510
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,079
they'd been testing on rats,
called, er, Reducio.

511
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,279
It had been a bit of a
disappointment, she said,

512
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,439
so... she bought a few bottles of it
home to do some more work on and...

513
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,719
It's OK, Phillips, we
won't tell anyone. Go on.

514
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,639
Well, I just borrowed a bottle.

515
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,079
I've always struggled with me weight

516
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,679
and, well, I wanted to see
if this was the one, you know,

517
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,319
the one diet product
that actually worked.

518
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,479
And boy, did it?

519
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,359
Yeah, just one spoonful a day.

520
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,879
You know, you can still
eat anything you want.

521
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,040
And the fat...

522
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,319
It all comes out in your pores.

523
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,799
You sweat it out!

524
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,319
Yeah, you sweat all the fat out!

525
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,359
That is genius.

526
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,240
And what did your wife say when
she saw how much you'd lost?

527
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,639
Well my wife didn't say anything.

528
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,919
She didn't say anything?
You were a freak!

529
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,159
When you stood on the scales,
it just said, "To be continued".

530
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,159
She must have said something!

531
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,280
No. No, no, cos she didn't know.

532
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,560
You see, just before
I took the bottle,

533
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:09,800
she told me she was leaving me
for a body-builder from Purley.

534
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,319
She left that night.

535
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,159
DANA GASPS

536
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,479
Oh! Oh! Phillips! Excellent news!

537
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,079
What!?

538
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,919
That you have lost so much
weight is excellent news!

539
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,800
But let me just confirm one thing...

540
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:30,679
that your wife has absolutely no idea
the product worked so well for you?

541
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,039
No. No, none at all.
No.

542
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,799
Do you know when Spitz-Kleinman were
planning on starting human trials?

543
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,599
Well, er, it could be a
matter of months, she said.

544
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,519
Or even a year.

545
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,759
Do you, I mean to say, that is...

546
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,959
Do you think we could have
an incy-wincy little look

547
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,080
at this bottle?
Maurice?

548
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,239
Oh, I mean, I'd love to.

549
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,799
Dana.

550
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,200
HE INHALES DEEPLY

551
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,240
But I finished the last of it
two days ago, I'm afraid.

552
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,559
OK, no problem.

553
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,599
Well, why don't we
pop into the kitchen

554
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,559
and get you some lard
or refined sugars

555
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,239
or whatever it is you
generally like to eat,

556
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,120
while we have a nice little
chat with Mr Mullen?

557
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,599
Do you have any idea how much
a product like that could be worth?

558
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,519
One that actually does
what we say it does?

559
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,799
We could make billions!
Literally billions!

560
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,760
We sell it as a health
supplement, "aiding

561
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:48,719
weight loss", to
bypass the regs.

562
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,439
And beat Spitz to the market!

563
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,719
No more looking over our shoulders,
no more fighting off lawsuits.

564
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,639
Instead, we'd be feted,
we'd be honoured!

565
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,439
The Nobel Prize for services to fat!

566
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,639
Arise, Sir Dean and Dana!

567
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,679
Of Deville!

568
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,719
THEY GASP

569
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,639
Excuse me.

570
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,800
Sorry to interrupt, but aren't
you forgetting something?

571
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,239
He used it all, remember?

572
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,999
You don't actually have the drug.

573
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,639
What do have is a man who
successfully broke into

574
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,559
one of the most secure
galleries in London.

575
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,159
How much harder can it be
to break in to a laboratory?

576
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,919
- And steal the formula?
- Why not?

577
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,239
HE LAUGHS

578
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,279
Oh, no.

579
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,239
Equal share, the three of us.

580
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,439
This is big pharma, you're talking
about. Those guys are scary.

581
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,159
We pay you a flat fee, then.

582
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,399
You just help us steal it, don't
get involved in any of the rest.

583
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,799
Sorry.

584
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,999
- Same as for the egg.
- Not interested.

585
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,559
- 100, then. - Nope.
- OK, double.

586
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,039
200,000 sterling. COD.

587
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,520
Then you're out.

588
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,719
A quarter of a million,

589
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,560
and I'll do it.

590
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Quarter of a million it is.

591
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,679
But this time, he'll
come along for the ride.

592
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,959
What?!

593
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,439
You want Dean to take
part in the break-in?

594
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,559
Just as an observer.
I want to be absolutely certain

595
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,319
that we're handing over a quarter
of a brick for the real deal.

596
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,240
- Er, sweetheart, can...
- Be quiet, Dean. OK!

597
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,359
It's your money.

598
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,200
But as an observer,
nothing more.

599
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,479
That's a kayaking course.

600
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,319
That one's rock climbing
up one of them walls.

601
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,319
Oh, and that's a
ballroom dancing course.

602
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,919
"The Merengue, the Salsa,
the American Smooth."

603
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,759
Blimey, just reading about
them's making me hungry.

604
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,279
But that's the thing, isn't it?

605
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,839
Nothing wrong with having a blow-out,
if you're burning off the calories.

606
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

607
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,799
What? Why would you not even try it?
Just one of 'em, surely.

608
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,159
- And why wouldn't you?
- I dunno. It's just...

609
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,320
What?

610
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,119
Oh, it's, going on
your own, isn't it?

611
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,278
It's the same for me.

612
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:08,720
If I had someone to go
with, I'd do it in a shot.

613
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:11,720
- Would you, really?
- Like a shot.

614
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,659
So don't you know
anyone, then, that we

615
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,259
can ring and ask, you
know, to take you?

616
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,479
Yeah, I do know this one fella.

617
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,159
He's a bit of a numpty, but
I just think he's painfully shy.

618
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,240
But I really like him

619
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:26,679
and I'd love to spend some more time
with him when I get out of here.

620
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,079
Oh. OK, yeah.

621
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,320
Pass us a phone,
I'll give him a bell.

622
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,560
Yeah, all right, there you go.

623
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,639
It's ringing.

624
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,440
Mine's ringing now.

625
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,319
Hello?

626
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,639
- Hi, is this Eddie?
- Yeah, speaking.

627
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,119
Hi, Eddie, it's Carol.
I'd like to know, when I get out,

628
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,200
will you go ballroom dancing with me?

629
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,840
Hello?
Anybody here?

630
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,720
Service!

631
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,519
Cor, disgraceful behaviour, innit?

632
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,920
Just can't get the staff these days.

633
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,519
So.

634
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,879
All we have to do,
is get in to one of their labs,

635
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,360
plant the formula inside it,
and get out of the lab,

636
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:27,199
so that we can get back in again
to take out what we've just put in.

637
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,879
- Simple!
- Ash, can you handle the data?

638
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,679
I've just lost six stone,

639
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,759
I am strong, I am empowered,
I am beautiful.

640
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,120
- Is that a yes?
- Go on, then.

641
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,359
Sean, we'll need
some promotional stuff.

642
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,440
Albert, fake IDs?

643
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:40,639
No problem.

644
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,159
Emma, we need you inside.

645
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,919
Now, they're looking for domestics.
Give them a call.

646
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,599
And I need to work out a way
to get us undisturbed access

647
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,240
to a lab for an hour or so.

648
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,839
The key, in jobs like this one,
is to contrive a way

649
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,759
to walk in through the front
door, find the right lab,

650
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,199
take the formula,
and walk out again, calmly,

651
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,999
without attracting attention.

652
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,119
Here you are.

653
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,839
And right now, I have a team
of experts working very hard

654
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,040
to make that plan work.

655
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:11,519
Dean.
You and I will be officers from

656
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,639
the National lnstitute for
Health and Clinical Excellence,

657
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,559
come to do a spot-check
on their clinical facilities.

658
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,999
Once we're inside reception, we will
tell security we need to inspect

659
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,919
two labs, that we will need
for no longer than 15 minutes.

660
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,599
We'll also tell them we
need those labs cleared.

661
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,519
Dean, you and I will have IDs and
numbers to call for verification,

662
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,039
though any call they make
will be diverted to one of my team.

663
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,319
You've done this before.

664
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,559
HE SMIRKS

665
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,119
All we need to do now is find out which
lab Reducio is being developed in.

666
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,799
My IT experts are hacking
their mainframe to find out...

667
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,999
so that we know which lab
we want to "randomly" check.

668
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,120
Once we have that information,
we're good to go.

669
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,240
- Healthy lifestyle, healthy fridge.
- Oh, Eddie.

670
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,559
Thank you so much.

671
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,280
You're such a lovely man.

672
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,600
Better than a kick in the teeth...

673
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,439
Sean Kennedy?

674
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,559
Yeah?

675
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,919
DS Rivet, Hoxton nick.

676
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,400
I think we need to have
a little chat.

677
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,800
Oh, no.

678
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,519
What the hell's happened?

679
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,079
They're questioning Sean
about the Tenguiz break-in.

680
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,079
Seems he dropped something
that IDs him.

681
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,440
- Oh, my God. Is he going to blab?
- No, of course not.

682
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:20,079
What's the problem, then?

683
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,439
Kid'll be out in ten,

684
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,119
still got time to make
something of himself.

685
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,319
The problem is that the police
are watching us like hawks...

686
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,159
so we're not going to go ahead
with the Spitz job.

687
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,879
Any of us.
It's suicide.

688
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,240
He's right, I'm sorry, it's over.

689
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,079
Wait!

690
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,559
They're not watching us.

691
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,239
They don't even know about us.

692
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,440
And?

693
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,840
Oh, no.

694
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,919
You mean we do it?!

695
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,239
The two of us?
The break-in?

696
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,019
Why not?
We could wear earpieces.

697
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,439
Mullen could talk us through it.
What do you say, Mullen?

698
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,799
- I say you're insane.
- Really? How hard can it be?

699
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,679
Honey, it could...
Shut up! Come on, why not?

700
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,079
We didn't learn this
business overnight.

701
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,119
- It takes years of experience.
- You underestimate me.

702
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,799
You have no idea of some of the
things I've done to make money.

703
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,199
We've never been beaten,
never failed.

704
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,879
Well, you have now.
It's a crazy idea.

705
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,519
Fine. Walk away from
250,000 sterling then.

706
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,919
When we're so close.

707
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,559
So close!

708
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,479
Come on, Mullen!
We can make this work.

709
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,960
Remember how good that
money felt in your hands.

710
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,279
OK.

711
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,720
OK, but we have to move fast, while
they're preoccupied with Sean.

712
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,800
HE CLICKS HIS TEETH

713
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,239
OK, I confess, I can't take it
any longer, I did it.

714
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,039
But of course you did it.

715
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,319
We all know you did it.

716
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,679
Yeah, I did it.

717
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,159
I went to the Tenguiz gallery

718
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,040
and I dropped a bit of litter
on the floor.

719
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,399
I wonder if you'll find it
so funny standing in the dock,

720
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,360
facing down a ten stretch.

721
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,640
Testing, testing.

722
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,439
Cor-blimey guv'nor, it's a real
pea-souper, make no mistake.

723
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,839
Remind me why we thought
this was a good idea.

724
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,039
Dean, they do have
American employees.

725
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,799
Cuppa Rosy-Lee, don't mind
if I do! Ta very much!

726
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,559
I bet Sean's more relaxed
than me right now.

727
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,080
Maybe this time, this time,
we may have gone too far.

728
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,640
Don't say a freakin' word

729
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:52,279
or I swear I'll never do the
thing with the mango again.

730
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,279
Mango?

731
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,279
Jessica Amwell, Paul Banstead, National
lnstitute for Clinical Excellence.

732
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,679
We're doing a lab spot-check in light
of the Strep-C outbreak in Munich

733
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,639
and we've selected two of your labs
at random, numbers three and 14.

734
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,199
'To inspect, we'll need uninterrupted
access for approximately 15 minutes.

735
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,040
'You will wish to confirm our IDs.'

736
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:14,199
You can talk to our authentication
department on this number.

737
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,680
Thank you so much.

738
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,880
MOBILE RINGS

739
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,839
Good morning,

740
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,740
National lnstitute for Health
and Clinical Excellence

741
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:31,640
Authentication department.
How can I help you?

742
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,120
'Emma? They're clearing everyone out
of the lab. Put the files in place.'

743
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,239
We had a scientist up in Scotland last
year who caught a new flesh-eating bug.

744
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,700
By the time they got to
him, all that was left

745
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,160
was one thumb and an earlobe.
True story!

746
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,560
Not too obvious, Em.

747
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,160
We're good from here, thank you.

748
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,040
Mullen, we're in.

749
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,200
'OK, now what have you got?

750
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,359
' Three computers, I'm on the first.
Opening it up.

751
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,999
'OK, I can't see anything,

752
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,799
'I can't see anything.'

753
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,599
What am I looking for?
Facts?

754
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,199
Come on, come on, come on.

755
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,120
Are we 100% sure
this is the right lab?

756
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,999
Let me try another computer.

757
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,200
OK, second computer.

758
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,959
- Security?
- Go ahead.

759
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,799
- There's a problem at reception.
- On my way.

760
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,080
Come on, come on!

761
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,239
Hang on.

762
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,199
I got something here, too.

763
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,359
Reducio Optimum 7?

764
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,319
'That's it, that's it.'

765
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,120
It's here, too.

766
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,599
These guys have got
no idea on branding.

767
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,239
It should be Fat-U-Sweat.

768
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,399
'Perspira-Go'.

769
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,919
'Or Fatooze.'

770
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,919
Guys, can we just download
the file and get the hell out?

771
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,240
Now?

772
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,399
Right, what have you got?

773
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,679
Look, this doesn't match.

774
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,240
Security breach.

775
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,080
We've got it!

776
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,999
So near, so very, very near.

777
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,759
This is a very strange sensation.

778
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,719
I'm rooting for the mark.

779
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,319
It's all gone weird.

780
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,280
The Americans
are on the third floor!

781
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,280
(Try the back exit.)

782
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,720
'Boys, the third floor.'

783
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,359
THEY WHOOP AND HOLLER WITH DELIGHT

784
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,400
Come on!

785
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,400
THEY CACKLE GLEEFULLY

786
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,239
'Woo! Woo!

787
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,280
'Go, go, go!'

788
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,679
Your money?

789
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,879
My money.

790
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,239
You... moron!

791
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,560
You didn't seriously think

792
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:26,039
we were going to give you a quarter
of a million G's, did you?

793
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,599
Why not, we had a deal?

794
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,479
I'll tell you why not.

795
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,119
Because we did all the hard work.
That's why not.

796
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,920
- I think you're being unfair.
- Really?

797
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:37,279
I did a lot of preparation
behind the scenes.

798
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,160
I did some work you didn't even see.

799
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:41,919
I don't give a rat's ass what
you did behind the scenes.

800
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,360
We have the formula...
it's being made up

801
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,799
right now... and we don't
need you any more!

802
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,399
Boo-hoo-hoo!

803
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,880
Seriously, what sort of
idiots do you think we are?

804
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,360
The sort who thought I was
attaching a microphone

805
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:55,839
to that brooch when
actually it was a camera.

806
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,079
A camera that filmed you and your
husband breaking in to Spitz-Kleinman.

807
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,560
Cup of Rosy-Lee, don't mind
if I do, ta very much!

808
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,279
The footage of which
I've put on a DVD

809
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,199
and have given to my assistant

810
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,039
who is at this moment
outside Scotland Yard

811
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,199
waiting for my phone call.

812
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,160
Those sorts of idiots.

813
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,439
250 grand, cash, please.

814
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,679
I almost feel bad.

815
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,800
Yeah, cos they think
that's the worst thing

816
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:28,919
that's going to happen to them today.

817
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,639
You know,
it almost seems unfair.

818
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,119
Almost!

819
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,559
THEY LAUGH

820
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,520
Are you sure this is
the right formula?

821
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,039
I stole it myself, so I think
I know what I'm doing.

822
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,759
Now shut up and give me the bottle!

823
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,280
- I want to sweat some fat.
- Yeah, me, too! Huh!

824
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,440
You're definitely sweating.

825
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,400
Oh, my...

826
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,799
Yeah, that's what I thought.

827
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,159
Cos that formula's just an emetic.

828
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,520
HE STIFLES VOMITING

829
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,160
A very powerful one, granted.

830
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,399
HE RETCHES VIOLENTLY

831
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,480
But an emetic just the same.

832
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,759
SHE PANTS

833
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,959
We just gave him 250 grand
for something that makes you sick?!

834
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,919
Well, at least we still
have the egg, honey.

835
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,479
HOARSELY: 50 grand for an egg
that's now worth 20 times that.

836
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,719
He may think he had us,
he may think he was smart,

837
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,639
but we're still way up
on the deal!

838
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,319
Who's the idiot now, Mullen?
Who's laughing now!

839
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,680
HE RETCHES

840
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,920
Excuse me?

841
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,480
Is that meant to be in there?

842
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,919
It's believed the egg might have
been accidentally moved by a cleaner

843
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,240
or even a practical joker,

844
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,300
but however it happened,
Lord Tenguiz declared

845
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:17,359
he was delighted to
have his egg back.

846
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,000
As you can see, the egg is now...

847
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:22,399
Mmm. I'm no legal expert, but I'd
imagine it's quite difficult

848
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,079
to charge someone for stealing
something that hasn't been stolen.

849
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,040
Wouldn't you say?

850
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,879
'The egg is now back in its rightful
place, and what a piece of art it is.

851
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,080
'It was created... '

852
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:42,039
But, but, no!

853
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:47,119
He stole it! He said,
if you used the black light...

854
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,239
If you subject Styteline to a
15-nanosecond blast of black light,

855
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,679
it temporarily changes
the refractive index.

856
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,320
And if you believe that load of old
cobblers, you'll believe anything.

857
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,559
We saw him leave the room with it.

858
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,760
We saw him leave the room with it!

859
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,760
No!

860
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,479
We do the cons!
We're the ones who do the conning!

861
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,520
This really has to be
your best work. The best.

862
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,199
We're the ones who do
the goddamn conning!

863
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,399
So they had to do
the robbery themselves,

864
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,439
or they could have
gone to the police.

865
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,799
Or come after us.
But now, they can't do either.

866
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,959
Yeah, but how would you know
for sure they would offer to do it?

867
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,439
Well, their arrogance,
their greed, their need?

868
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,400
All we had to do was convince them
none of us could do the job.

869
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,719
So you dropped the receipt
deliberately. Unbelievable!

870
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,520
How you lot pull it off,
I've no idea.

871
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:43,879
Oh! Says the man who pulled off the
greatest con of the 21st century.

872
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,439
It's quite remarkable, Eddie.

873
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,199
You managed to convince Carol
you're an attractive man!

874
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,799
Oi! We think he's a bit
of all right, don't we Carol?

875
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,399
I won't hear a word
against him. Mwah!

876
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,119
OTHERS: Oooh!

877
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,319
All right, how about a toast,
how about a toast?

878
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,799
To Eddie, to Carol, to all of us...
and our good health.

879
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,240
ALL: Our good health!

880
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,999
Hang on.

881
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,799
Crudites, anyone?
Low-fat dip?

882
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,799
He's a friend of
chairman Mao, isn't he?

883
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,919
Ooh!

884
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,519
Hey, Chinese... now you're talking.
Who's got a menu?

885
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,679
Cheers, all.

886
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,879
Cheers!

887
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,680
GLASSES CLINK
