1
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:06,060
Max, guess what Han's
doing at the counter?

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,897
Well, I know it's not towering over it.

3
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:12,900
He's creating signature
drinks for the diner.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:17,338
I suggested any household
poison over shaved ice.

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,706
Han, this is a stupid idea.

6
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:20,774
It was Earl's.

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,477
Then it's genius.

8
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:28,582
Yep, I've been drinking
all afternoon for free.

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,084
Now, I've used only top shelf liquor.

10
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:35,255
Question: Who got it down for you?

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:38,325
First up: "The Max". It's just whiskey.

12
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:42,362
On the rocks, like Max's job.

13
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:46,665
Whatever mine is, I want my rim salted.

14
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:51,805
Of course you do.

15
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,574
Earl's is an Old Fashioned
with everything.

16
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,543
Pour me another me.

17
00:00:56,544 --> 00:01:00,747
I hate to say it, but I go down easy.

18
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:04,651
"The Caroline" is Lemon Schnapps
in a slightly frosty glass.

19
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:06,920
Because of my cool,
Grace Kelly kind of demeanor?

20
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,822
No, because they had a
sale on Lemon Schnapps

21
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,858
at Beverage Barn

22
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,928
Oh, they don't card there?

23
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,830
Okay, so what's "The Han"?

24
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,899
A No Sex on the Beach?

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,535
Mine is a classic martini, shaken.

26
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,196
Oh, like the first woman
who saw you naked.

27
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:30,510
Correction.

28
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:33,713
Will see you naked.

Max, guess what happened
when you were running

34
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:55,014
to the bathroom real
quick, for two hours.

35
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,065
You worked the cupcake
window while I went

36
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,552
to see The Statue of Liberty.

37
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,521
Her head was being renovated.

38
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,824
Everybody in this town
is getting work done.

39
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,859
I sold our last cupcake tee!

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,461
We've sold out more than Robert De Niro

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,731
in the last 20 years of his career.

42
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:16,035
Well, analyze this, Focker.

43
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,237
I noticed we were running low last week,

44
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,873
so I ordered more.

45
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,975
How did I not notice those sooner?

46
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,064
Oh, probably because the
last time I looked in there,

47
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:29,315
there was a rat having
sex with a cockroach.

48
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,751
You know, they're still dating.

49
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,453
Really? I thought it
was a one time thing.

50
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:39,225
Well, I guess once you go
rat, you never go back.

51
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,727
Thanks for ordering these,
I've just been so busy

52
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,095
with Sophie's wedding shower.

53
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,397
Yeah, why are you working so hard?

54
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,798
It's not a big deal.

55
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,033
I threw my mother a shower once.

56
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,736
No wait, I threw her in a shower once.

57
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,339
Max, you really need to start
making more of a fuss.

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,007
It's for Sophie, it means a lot to her,

59
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,376
and she has a gun.

60
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,145
Well, showers are stupid girl things

61
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,116
that this guy wants no part of.

62
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,486
Hey, girls!

63
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,423
Look. I'm advertising
your cupcake business.

64
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,194
You're advertising something,
but it's not our cupcakes.

65
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,496
I gave out free T-shirts to our building.

66
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,698
I left one by everyone's door.

67
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,900
Two at Sophie's, 16 at the Sanchez's.

68
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,404
So about six of the kids
will have to share.

69
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,440
Interesting. Now our shirts
are available at both Rodney,

70
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,375
the high-end Manhattan boutique,

71
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,144
and an apartment building
that always smells

72
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,247
a little like gasoline.

73
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,750
Well, please stop talking
about things that aren't me.

74
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:43,522
Now girls, did you get the cake

75
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,724
for my wedding shower tomorrow?

76
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,060
Oh, was I supposed to make a cake?

77
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,095
I've literally done
nothing for this shower.

78
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,532
I haven't even taken a bath.

79
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,368
Oh, no, I'm not getting
my cake from here.

80
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,670
No, this is my bridal shower.

81
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,673
Yeah, I want to get something
classic from Baskin Robbins

82
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,443
that's also a Dunkin' Donuts.

83
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,846
They mix those two now?

84
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,449
It's a stoner's dream come true.

85
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,151
I tried to make our apartment look nice.

86
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,387
I even moved a chair to cover a stain,

87
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,822
but what was under the
chair was so much worse.

88
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:21,559
I guess what I'm saying is,
please don't shoot us.

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,629
Well, I don't expect
it to look that good.

90
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,166
I mean, you can't put
a silk hat on a pig.

91
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,768
And I know, 'cause I tried once.

I realized I don't like
a strawberry center.

96
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,966
And I am not going to
beat myself up about it.

97
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,368
When I told you to get
crepe paper streamers

98
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,372
and decorate for the shower, I
meant with pink, not black.

99
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,174
It's a wedding shower for Sophie,

100
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:14,145
not a baby shower for Rosemary's Baby.

101
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,214
What? I told you, I don't do girl things.

102
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:21,619
Like hang pink or sit when I pee.

103
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,458
Which, coincidentally, I
refer to as "hanging pink."

104
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,693
My God, what is that smell?

105
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,795
Something's really gone bad here.

106
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,398
Besides our lives.

107
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,966
It's the Polish food.

108
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,503
I think one of those sausages
is made of old flip-flops.

109

[knock at door]

110
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,673
Someone's here already?

111
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,141
Are Polish people always early?

112
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:49,880
Is that a stereotype I don't know about?

113
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:54,418
Oh my God!

114
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,554
A wedding shower for me?

115
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:02,659
I mean, if I had known,
I would have dressed!

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,428
Sophie, you did know.

117
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,898
I know. I came down early
to practice some entrances.

118
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,970
Now get ready for entrance number two.

119
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:17,741
Are you ever ready for
entrance number two?

I can't believe it.

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,692
Oh, it's the day of my wedding shower.

126
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:41,097
Could anything be more wonderful?

127
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,299
I was moved, I was surprised.

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
I liked it better than the book.

129
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,469
Now, come on in here and
identify some of this

130
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,806
Polish food so I can know
what I'm not eating tonight.

131
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,308
Oh, no. I'm not eating at my shower.

132
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,344
I'm pretending I have an eating disorder

133
00:06:54,345 --> 00:07:00,016
so everyone will think
that I have it all.

134
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,550
I think you're going to be happy.

135
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,086
I have lots of fun shower games,

starting with "Who Knows
The Most About Sophie?"

137
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,758
Oh, I'll win that one.

138
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,826
Yeah.

139
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,628
And Sophie's got to tinkle.

140
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,531
See? I'm a shoo-in.

141
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:18,301

144

Yeah, I love the mystery of
not knowing when you're done.

146

148
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,958
Oh, that's got to be for me.

149
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,793
I didn't do it.

150
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,629
And just so you know, the
statute of limitations is up

151
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,265
on that Newark thing.

152
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,967
I'm not here to arrest you, miss.

153
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,401
Great, it's me.

154
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:55,271
Max, I told you pirating
movies was a real crime.

155
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:59,875
Now I'm going to jail for
<i>Fifty Shades Of Grey.</i>

156
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,912
Someone should.

157
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,713
I hear you, not the Christian Grey

158
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:09,385
I'd pictured.

159
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:11,153
I'm Agent Drake with the FBI.

160
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,389
Nothing to get upset about, but
there's a man in your building

161
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,557
who's been holding three women hostage

162
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,425
in his apartment for months.

163
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:19,361
Yeah, that sounds about right.

164
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:21,063
Now, one of the captives escaped today

165
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,731
and alerted authorities.

166
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:23,933
Oh, that must have
been the lady I passed

167
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,202
screaming in the hall.

168
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,071
What? There is a fine line
between "hostage"

169
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:32,708
and "off your meds" in this building.

170
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,842
So, a SWAT team is going in

171
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,177
for the other two still upstairs.

172
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,969
But we need to evacuate the building first.

173
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,780
So let's go.

174
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,916
All right, can I just put
a few things away first.

175
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,185
You know, because I want
the place to look nice

176
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,088
if there's going to be police in here.

177
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,756
Look, miss, whatever drugs
you're hiding in here,

178
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:48,857
I couldn't care less.

179
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,759
We need to get out now.

180
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,729
You know, you're just my type of guy.

181
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,965
You don't mind my drug use
and you're already here.

182
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:05,941
Oh, yeah!

183
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:11,513
You girls ordered a cop
stripper for my bridal shower?

184
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:15,150
Oh, here comes the bride all right!

185
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,086
Come on. Yeah.

186
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:22,079
Yeah, see? Look, he likes me.

187
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,003
I cannot believe I live in this building

188
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,739
with a man who would
do something so awful.

189
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,109
Also, cannot believe
I live in this building.

190
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,744
You know who I think it is?

191
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,714
Smells Like Cats But Has No Cats.

192
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,284
Really? He doesn't seem like a go-getter.

193
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:49,188
I think it's Three Nipples No Nose.

194
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,292
Three Nipples No Nose? He's a delight.

195
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,528
Sophie, isn't this upsetting?

196
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,296
It sure is.

197
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,333
I couldn't get that stripper
cop to take his pants off.

198
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,237
Hey, look, there's some
of my shower guests.

199
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,072
Oh, look.

200
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,607
And see? That one's my friend Natalya.

201
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,142
The one I told you about.

202
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,544
Yeah, there's all that extra skin.

203
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,381
Ew. You were not exaggerating.

204
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,483
She was born with all that skin.

205
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,418
She had a chip clip on her back

206
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,922
all through high school.

207
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,792
Yeah, I know that guy
upstairs is a real bummer,

208
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,294
but you know what would help?

209
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,097
If I could open my presents.

210
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,799
Yeah.

211
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,701
(Sophie) Oh, no!

212
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,603
The fuzz isn't letting them through!

213
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,204
Oh, come on.

214
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,407
No fair, they just let a guy
in here a few minutes ago.

215
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,643
Just 'cause your friends
aren't bomb-sniffing dogs,

216
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,846
they can't get in? Boo!

217
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:52,150
Hey, look, ladies, pass your
presents up to the cops.

218
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,887
Cops, pass my presents to me.

219
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,656
Wait, Sophie, before you open them,

220
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,658
I really want to write
down who got you what.

221
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,428
And save that pretty ribbon,
I'm gonna make you a bow hat!

222
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,596
Look at you.

223
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,132
Making lemonade out of a maniac

224
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,668
holding three innocent women hostage.

225
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,469
(Sophie) Oh, a gift card.

226
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,739
Oh, send it back.

227
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,308
Sophie, we would've taken that.

228
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,709
I don't know what is was for,

229
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,678
I just know that we would've taken it.

230
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,279
No, I'm sending it back.

231
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,015
I want a gift, not another errand.

232
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,153
Oh, yeah, not in love
with the paper, but...

233
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,790
well, I'll wait till I open it to judge.

234
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,424
(Maria) Hi. Excuse me.

235
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,692
Excuse me?

236
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,395
I'm Maria Alonso-Gonzalez.

237
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,830
Could you ladies talk to Channel 2

238
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,865
about tonight's disturbing discovery?

239
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,233
- No.
- Yes.

240
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,369
Just go with me and my business savvy.

241
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,805
Yes, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
we can answer a few questions.

242
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,541
Were there any signs at all
that something of this nature

243
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,510
was going on in your building?

244
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,245
We just hope they bring this sick freak

245
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,148
in our building to justice so
that we can return to work

246
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,051
at Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

247
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,786
(Maria) Get on the door. Here he comes.

248
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,521
Who is it? Who is this sick freak?

249
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,162
It's not me.

250
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,598
Is it?

251
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,835
I'm not sure, what are the charges?

252
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,104
Different sick freak.

253
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,741
Hey, Rula, Uma, Greta, look.

254
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,076
(Sophie) This is him.

255
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,679
This is the groom-to-be.

256
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,581
Forget about the guy upstairs,

257
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:35,486
this is the real maniac in the bedroom.

258
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,254
[gasping]

259
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,856
That's him?

260
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,392
Beer Belly Gym Shorts?

261
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,127
- Never would've guessed.
- Oh, no.

262
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,629
(Caroline) He's wearing one of our shirts.

263
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,797
Why?

264
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:50,233
Why? Why is he wearing a medium?

265
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,541
Oh...

266
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,242
I mean, nobody's gonna see that.

267
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,351
(Maria) Police have just
apprehended the suspect

268
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,454
and the question on everyone's mind is,

269
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,789
"What does Max's Homemade Cupcakes

270
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,060
have to do with this?"

271
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,762
We have no comment.

272
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:22,199
Or future, or deodorant.

273
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,735
So leave us alone!

274
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,403
How did they find out
we work in this dump,

275
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,838
next door to the other dump?

276
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,272
As I'm saying it, I realize our career

277
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,875
is made up of two dumps.

278
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,644
Sounds like our career has
been drinking too much coffee.

279
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:37,848
The story is all over the paper.

280
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,751
They're calling those ladies
"The Cupcake Captives,"

281
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,753
calling that guy "The Cupcake Captor,"

282
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,790
and calling the whole thing
"The Cupcake Catastrophe."

283
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,825
But you needn't worry
about it reflecting badly

284
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,428
on your cupcake business.

285
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,865
Oh, no. It's even in the fashion section.

286
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,367
There's a picture of our
shirts and it says,

287
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:01,805
"What not to wear, ever."

288
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,140
Okay. Everybody calm down.

289
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,409
I'm mostly talking to myself.

290
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,611
The media is just going to do its thing.

291
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,780
I've been slandered in
the headlines before.

292
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:14,517
I was called "Ponzi
Princess," "Bankrupt Barbie."

293
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:17,787
Looking back, those were the best of times.

294
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:20,356
Oh, hello. I was just
about to take a tray

295
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,193
of Max and Carolines out
to my reporter friends.

296
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:26,162
Sorry, you can give those
Max and Carolines

297
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:29,532
to this Max and Caroline.

298
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,868
Hi, everybody.

299
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,870
Oh, I'm depressed.

300
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:38,341
See, you can tell 'cause I'm
only wearing half my hair.

301
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:41,444
Girls, I found this box
outside your door.

302
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:44,280
And I was hoping it was a shower present.

303
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:49,685
Since those selfish hostage
girls ruined my special day.

304
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:53,623
Oh, man. I didn't even get
a freakin' ribbon hat.

305
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,893
Do you want the tube top
I made out of the police tape?

306
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,228
I'm calling it a tape top.

307
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:01,330
Patent pending.

308
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,565
Come on, you guys.

309
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,833
This isn't about us.

310
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,668
We need to put this all in perspective.

311
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,137
We're all safe, and healthy, and...

312
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,306
Oh, my God, just when
I can't take anymore,

313
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,641
here comes anymore.

314
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,544
"We are returning the remainder
of your t-shirt stock.

315
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:18,180
"Our Rodney brand cannot be
associated with a product

316
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:21,484
"at the center of an ongoing
criminal investigation.

317
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,019
Consider our contract null and void."

318
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,522
This is so shocking.

319
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:30,025
Max, you can read?

320
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:35,764
So you just didn't want to
tell people the specials.

321
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,099
I can't believe this.

322
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,767
We waited so long for something to happen

323
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,402
to our cupcake t-shirts.

324
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,770
Why that guy?

325
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,320
And on the one day
he chooses to not wear

326
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,641
his "Pull my finger" shirt.

327
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,544
(Maria) This is Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
reporting to you live...

328
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:50,092
Max, what are you doing? They'll see us.

329
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,547
- from Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
- No they won't,

330
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,783
Because all the cameras
are on Han right now.

331
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,552
Can you talk a little
bit about the women

332
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,421
behind Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

333
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:01,857
Well, let's just say Max and Caroline

334
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,359
are allergic to work,
much in the same way

335
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,294
Dilbert is allergic to Mondays.

336
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:09,431
[laughs]

337
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,767
Moving on, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,

338
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,635
would you care to come into
The Williamsburg Diner,

339
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:16,171
6355 Bedford Avenue,

340
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:17,939
open 8:00 A.M. till 2:00 A.M.,

341
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,610
for our signature drink:
The Cupcake Captive Cosmo?

342
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:26,113
And for you gents,
The Captive Cape Cod?

343
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,751
Hey, get these cupcakes
out of the garbage.

344
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,787
I need to make room for Han's body.

345
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:36,424
I'm keeping the head as a
warning to others who cross us.

346
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:38,126
We need to take back our t-shirts' image

347
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,028
by setting up an
interview with the news.

348
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,063
And by "we," I mean you.

349
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:46,234
Look, if I learned one thing
from my time on<i> Cops,</i>

350
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:49,304
it's that I can hop a fence
in three seconds flat.

351
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,439
If I learned two things,
it's that the camera

352
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,541
makes me look guilty.

353
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:57,045
Especially when it's a security
camera at Banana Republic.

354
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,379
I can't do it.

355
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,296
The world can't know
that Caroline Channing

356
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:02,550
is involved in another
high-profile crime.

357
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:05,286
And hasn't kept up her nail
maintenance, like, at all.

358
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,721
Fine.

359
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,957
Because if I learned
three things from<i> Cops,</i>

360
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,926
it's that it's best to surrender
early and not naked.

361
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,204
We really appreciate you
taking the time to talk to us.

362
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:24,772
If you really want to thank me,

363
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:27,808
how about I get some
pixels up over my grill?

364
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,679
I got some kids looking for me
and they don't need the help.

365
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,814
We don't have the
capability to do that.

366
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,349
This is live TV.

367
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,319
How about one of those
voice distorting machines?

368
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,822
You know, make my voice sound
like a fat Transformer.

369
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,725
Um, no.

370
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,160
No problem.

371
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,028
I'll take care of that myself.

372
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,565
Been in this sitch before.

373
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,801
All right, in 3, 2...

374
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,829
Good evening. In Williamsburg...

375
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,462
Max, I'm right here, if you need me.

376
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,096
- I got this.
- Now infamous in the shocking

377
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,564
"Cupcake Captives" story.

378
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,601
I'm here with the owner, Max Black.

379
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:09,506
[distorted] Hi, Maria.

380
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:12,509
Max, how upset were you to
see that Richard Griffin

381
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,212
was Max's Homemade
Cupcakes' biggest fan?

382
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,214
[distorted] I was really upset.

383
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,349
Okay, hi. Stepping in.

384
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,318
Max is clearly so upset by all this

385
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,387
that she's lost her mind.

386
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,889
The one time I really
needed her, anyway.

387
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,291
Hi, Maria.

388
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,693
How will your company's
reputation recover

389
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,428
from doing business with a man

390
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,731
who held three women in his
apartment against their will?

391
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,933
Look, people do terrible things.

392
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:40,103
And they do them wearing shirts.

393
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,605
That doesn't make the shirt evil.

394
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,874
Now, if a shirt commits
a crime, lock it up.

395
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,909
You'll get no argument from me.

396
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,114
[distorted] Should I jump back in?

397
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:53,216
Okay, yeah. That's all the time we have.

398
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,251
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,912
[distorted] Thank you.

400
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,661
Caroline, thank you for
trying to throw me a shower.

401
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:08,231
I mean, we were never
really friends or close.

402
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,633
And yeah, I run away when
I see you heading towards

403
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,502
the mailboxes the same time as me...

404
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,405
Please stop thanking me.

405
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,474
Hey. Want to come to our place?

406
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:19,676
Those pig feet haven't gone bad.

407
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,678
I guess. It's hard to tell.

408
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,950
Yeah. The best meat's
under the toe nails.

409
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,331
Is it?

410
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,325
(all) Surprise.

411
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:38,461
[shouting]

412
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:40,196
Oh, my God, what's all this?

413
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:41,531
Oh, no. I'm so surprised.

414
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,933
No, I really am this time.

415
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,302
- So am I.
- Me, too.

416
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,004
Until this sausage, I
thought the grossest thing

417
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,939
I'd ever eaten was kale.

418
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,774
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

419
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,744
Could anything be more wonderful?

420
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:57,146
[laughs]

421
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,949
Max, I can't believe you did all this.

422
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,757
I thought you came home
to do what you usually do

423
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:02,952
when you get depressed.

424
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,255
Get drunk and throw the finger
at people from the stoop.

425
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,658
No stoop. But I am drunk.

426
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,493
You think I could've done this sober?

427
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,329
I just figured, with everything
around us being so black lately,

428
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,398
I thought we needed a little pink.

429
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,599
You're right. We did.

430
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,234
'Cause our t-shirt business is over.

431
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:21,604
And we still have to pay off
that bank loan. Now what?

432
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:24,373
We'll figure something out. We always do.

433
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:26,275
Hey, girls, come quick.

434
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,844
We're gonna play "Guess
Sophie's Favorite Sex Position"

435
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,780
(all) Whoo!

436
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,784
It's on all fours, watching
<i>How To Get Away With Murder.</i>

437
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,853
See? I told you I was gonna win.

438
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,026
And it just got black again.

439
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:45,058
Yeah, real black.

440
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,933
This is wet. Max, did
you already eat this?

441
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,859
I told you I don't like
a strawberry centre.

442
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,226
I am not gonna beat myself up about it.

443
00:20:56,877 --> 00:21:04,493
