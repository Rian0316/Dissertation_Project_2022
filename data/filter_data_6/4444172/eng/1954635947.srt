00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:05,298
Welcome to the Williamsburg
Diner Awards Night!

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,141
And here's your host,
Neil Patrick Hairless!

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:12,677
This is the night
where everyone is recognized

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,747
for their, well... let's call it work.

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,315
Nice suit, Han.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,917
I loved you in<i> The Penguins of Madagascar.</i>

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,453
Here we go. The award for

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,323
Worst Excuse for Being
Late to Work goes to...

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:29,260
Earl, for: "I died."

10
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,728
It<i> was</i> true.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,832
I was dead for a full 60 seconds.

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,301
And the Foreign Film Award goes to...

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:41,272
Oleg, for always being
covered in a foreign film.

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,642
Yeah. I have so many bacteria to thank...

15
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:48,379
but a special shout-out to streptococcus!

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,315
And the winner for Best Lie
Told to Get a Bigger Tip

17
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,616
goes to...

18
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,251
Good luck, girl.

19
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:56,987
It's an honor to share
this category with you.

20
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,157
It's Max... for showing customers pictures

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,260
of her three small children
on a regular basis.

22
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,129
Wow. Oh!

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,765
This award is dedicated
to the lights of my life...

24
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,733
Maxine, Max Jr.,

25
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,436
and Maxi-Pad.

26
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,706
I know only one of you can see and hear me,

27
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,911
so please tell the others I... love... you.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,883
And the award for Best Waitress goes to...

29
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,784
It better not!

30
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,586
Caroline! No!

31
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:33,423
Well, I guess it's true...
women only win awards

32
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:36,426
when they take on roles
that are humiliating.

33
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:40,397
And the Best Animated Short
goes to Han Lee!

I'll be right back with your water
and a stomach pump.

39
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:10,774
Keep it. I know what I want.

40
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,276
Me too. But it just seems like

41
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:15,820
Taylor Swift is never going away.

42
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:21,660
You're funny. Yeah.
I'm not in the mood for funny.

43
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:25,697
I will take tomato soup, house salad,

44
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,501
extra croutons.
And you can charge me extra...

45
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:32,437
if you have no heart behind those gazongas.

46
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,306
It's cool. The guy at the counter

47
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:37,876
has no teeth, so you can have his.

48
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,012
Less funny... more salad. Right?

49
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:43,748
Maybe the blonde one should bring it.

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,617
Oh, you want her to bring it?

51
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,986
Maybe clear your calendar.

52
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:50,288
Uh, the lady in the booth
doesn't like my attitude

53
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,857
and wants you,
so I guess what I'm saying is

54
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,159
I still got it!

55
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:58,730
Wait, a customer asked for me
and didn't follow it with,

56
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,932
"I'd also like to see the manager"?

57
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,266
That's a first for me!

58
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:04,369
Yo, Blondie!

59
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,803
Croutons!

[ding ding]

61
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:09,974
Pick up. Tomato soup, house salad.

62
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:13,878
And I'm also running
a special on D batteries.

63
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,847
Buy both, and I'll thrown in
this bootleg copy

64
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,449
of<i> Horrible Bosses II.</i>

65
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:22,720
Here comes Horrible Bosses Too Small.

66
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:27,425
Need some new batteries
to keep walking and talking?

67
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:32,096
No, Max, I'm not powered
by double Ds like you.

68
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,671
Preach.

69
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:43,074
Don't buy batteries from that guy

70
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:46,577
unless you want your heart
to stop on the bus.

71
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,282
Oleg, this is supposed
to have extra croutons.

72
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:52,416
It's for my regular.

73
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:55,019
Yeah, you heard me. It happened.

74
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,354
Oh, no, "Extra Croutons" is here again?

75
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:59,456
Make sure you charge her extra.

76
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,192
I'm not made of stale bread!

77
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,428
No, you're made of Legos, right?

78
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,130
We are not charging her extra.

79
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,898
She looks like she can't afford it.

80
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,334
If she could, why would she be eating here?

81
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,969
Well, don't judge a book by its cover.

82
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:14,004
People look at me and...
Think you're bad in bed?

83
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,506
What's your point?

84
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:18,375
For your information, Max,
I'm not bad in bed.

85
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:22,479
In fact, I'm quite the stud
in my Sims community.

86
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,483
You wouldn't be a stud
in a retirement community.

87
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:28,619
[bell dings]

88
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:31,254
Hi! Here's your salad...

89
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,790
Uh... five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

90
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,692
Uh, continue.

91
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:37,494
And I wanted to introduce myself.

92
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:39,196
I'm Caroline, you're regular waitress.

93
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:40,564
Ah.

94
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:43,166
Oh! My turn. Sorry.

95
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,802
I live alone,
and my plants aren't this needy.

96
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm Nola.

97
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,806
And this is Max. Max, this is Nola.

98
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,475
'Sup, Lola?

99
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:52,742
It's Nola.

100
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,412
See, this is why I like the blonde one.

101
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,147
She listens.

102
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,583
May I please have a cheesecake?

103
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,084
Sure. And thank you, Nola.

104
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:03,286
I think it's important to listen to people.

105
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:05,889
Coming right back with that cherry pie.

106
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,827
I'll tell her if she ever stops listening.

107
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:14,464
I think Nola knows
I'm more than just a waitress.

108
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,499
She can see right through this uniform.

109
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:19,769
And so can I... in just the right light.

110
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,673
- Close the door!
- Oh, my God!

111
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:24,874
Sophie, you scared me!

112
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:26,409
You're scared?

113
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,846
I just saw the expiration
date on this milk!

114
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,281
Come on, close it, quick!

115
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,483
I'm in here hiding from Oleg.

116
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,184
If you wanna get away from Oleg,

117
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,987
just go anywhere they sell floss.

118
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,556
I think that Oleg is cheating on me.

119
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:41,924
Look. <i>Oh, God!</i>

120
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,460
Now she's gonna start whipping it out?

121
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:45,862
Look...

122
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:48,431
He has a second secret phone.

123
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,800
It's a boner phone.

124
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,069
You mean a burner phone.

125
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,704
Same thing.

126
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,139
Sophie, how do you know

127
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,607
he just doesn't use it
for long distance or...

128
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,309
Or for the woman
that I'm calling right now?

129
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,245
Oh, put her on speaker.

130
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,248
I've nothing else to do. I'm at work.

131
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,717

That... is a terrible Oleg.

136
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:28,470
He is not that articulate.

137
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,540
[woman speaking in Russian]

138
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,511
Hah! That old whore!

139
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:37,746
What did she say?

140
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,215
I have no idea!

141
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,984
I don't speak Russian, but...

142
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:45,020
I do speak "old whore."

143
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:47,723
Tell me, what is his problem?

144
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:51,293
He has a sweet, young filly like me at home

145
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,996
and he needs to go out and plow

146
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:57,432
some old Russian field?

147
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,038
Well... I'd ask what
you three are doing in here,

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,606
but it's never gonna top

149
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,376
what I'm imagining you're doing in here.

150
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,417
I can't believe
Nola didn't come in tonight.

151
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,253
This is exactly what happened
with my Starbucks barista guy.

152
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:25,623
One minute, he's suggestively
arranging the bananas at me,

153
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,092
and then next minute, he's face-down,

154
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,161
dead in a puddle of soy milk.

155
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,363
Max, what if something happened to her?

156
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,432
More croutons for us!

157
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,767
She said, "I'll see you tomorrow."

158
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,097
That doesn't mean anything.
It's just an expression

159
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:42,506
like, "Employees must wash hands."

160
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:47,144
Or... or, "The baby is yours."

161
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:49,346
Hey, everybody!

162
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,584
Oh, Sophie, it's just you.

163
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,586
You're poor!

164
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,121
And now we're even.

165
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,456
Look, I stole it again. Where's Oleg?

166
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,991
I'll tell you where he's not...

167
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,960
Culinary school.

168
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,160
He's on break.

169
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,264
Oh, she's gonna be sorry!

170
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,968
Oh... no one comes between
Sophie and her man.

171
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,171
You know... unless we pay them to.

172
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,808
Couple things...

173
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,245
A... does anyone ever work here?

174
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,348
Caroline, stop worrying.
Extra Croutons is fine.

175
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,684
She just called to order
some diner food to be delivered.

176
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:31,421
Oh! So she wants to die at home.

177
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,657
I said we don't do deliveries.

178
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,659
I told her you two can barely get the food

179
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,595
from the window to the tables!

180
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,168
Max, I had to stop by

181
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,170
and bring Nola her salad and croutons.

182
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,639
I mean, she's kind of
my biggest fan right now.

183
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,609
True...'cause you just lost me.

184
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,845
I know you think this is crazy,

185
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,380
but there's something about
the way Nola looks at me.

186
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,349
It's like she's seeing something in me.

187
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:01,885
The woman wears two pairs of glasses.

188
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:05,355
To her, you're just a chatty
yellow and orange blur.

189
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:08,692
I was told you didn't deliver.

190
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,895
By who, her old boyfriends?

191
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:14,731
Are you two gonna kill me or something?

192
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,399
Because if you are,

193
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,402
I would like to put on a different hat.

194
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,171
No, no, no. She got worried.

195
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,906
See, you're her first regular.

196
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,708
I'm just here for the story.

197
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,810
I figured there'd be something
freaky behind this door

198
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:30,580
like a 50-foot python
and what's left of the UPS guy.

199
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:32,816
And Earl guessed you were a man.

200
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,417
No man.

201
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,221
No, just me in here with
my vagina and my photographs.

202
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,023
Oh! You're a photographer?

203
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,558
I love photography!

204
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,293
And I love privacy.

205
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:44,861
And I love pot.

206
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,297
Oh, I thought we were going around.

207
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,565
Come on. You better come in too.

208
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,168
You're the Yin to her Yap.

209
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,703
Hey, careful where you step.

210
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:56,372
I can't find my third pair of glasses.

211
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,242
It's on top of your hat.
No, that's my fourth pair.

212
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,144
Hey!

213
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,912
This is Billy the bum!

214
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,581
He used to live in a box around
the corner from my apartment.

215
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,116
He even let me stay over once

216
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,851
when I had to get away
from this bad roommate.

217
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,554
Oh, the one before me? No, it was you.

218
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:14,457
You two are a riot together.

219
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,661
You remind me of me
and my old photographer friend

220
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:19,996
Annie Leibovitz.

221
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,464
Course, this was before...

222
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,032
Before she got famous?

223
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,434
No. Before she hit on me.

224
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:28,170
I told her I wasn't into girls.

225
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,640
But... I think she was
confused by the derby.

226
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,477
Yeah. I think we're all
a little confused by it.

227
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,580
Nola, I want to ask you
if you've ever had any success,

228
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:40,182
but I don't know how to
do that without insulting you.

229
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,952
That's correct. You don't.

230
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,657
Oh! You're having a gallery show in SoHo?

231
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,392
Good-bye.

232
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,228
Uh, it was nice of you two

233
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,596
to, uh, come over, check on me.

234
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,932
Uh... weird, but nice.

235
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,501
Perhaps we could come to the opening.

236
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:01,870
Oh. Oh, you don't need to do that.

237
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:03,439
I know we don't need to,

238
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,707
but maybe I want to support
you and your amazing work.

239
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,442
- And Max would enjoy. the free wine.
- Yes, I would.

240
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,544
[laughs] No.

241
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,379
Oh, I would.

242
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,615
No as in, "No, don't come."

243
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,217
Now, if you'll excuse me,

244
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,785
I wanna eat my croutons

245
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,021
without the vaudeville stylings

246
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,089
of Shecky and Nosy.

247
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:27,229
Here.

248
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,165
Oh, yeah, good. I was looking for this.

249
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,183
I can't believe you're doing all this

250
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,684
for a diner regular.

251
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,719
I haven't seen you
this desperate since Monday,

252
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:49,889
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

253
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,592
I know... on the weekends, I just give up.

254
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,894
Look that title!

255
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,663
"The Great Unwashed."

256
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,632
Are Oleg's balls here?

257
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,337
Max, it's the "art scene."

258
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,140
Class it up. At least say testicles.

259
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,775
Evening, ladies.

260
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,776
<i>Earl, what are you doing here?</i>

261
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:15,047
And, Han, your sweater's eating your head.

262
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,916
I'm here for the champagne

263
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:21,320
and because I couldn't find my way out.

264
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,991
I just walked into a picture of a door.

265
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:29,762
Some of these are going
for thousands of dollars!

266
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,831
That Nola bitch is rich, and I bet she has

267
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,801
a frigging summer house
made out of my free croutons!

268
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:40,239
Han, it's the art scene. Class it up.

269
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,476
At least say "freaking." Also, "testicles."

270
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,513
Well, I'm not wasting
this new turtleneck on you two.

271
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:49,148
I'm going to go mingle.

272
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,617
A high fashion model was giving me the eye.

273
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,986
Then she'd have to be high.

274
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:58,023
Uh, Han, I believe I'll stay here.

275
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,292
Nobody wins with a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle

276
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,327
as a wingman.

277
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,431
Oh, hey, everybody.

278
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,932
<i>Hey, Sophie. Hey, Oleg.</i>

279
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:10,068
So can I class it back down now?

280
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,504
Sorry we're late. I was just over there

281
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:16,208
admiring the photo of the happy
couple under the bridge.

282
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,644
Happy couple? Sophie, they're two junkies

283
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,812
sharing a needle.

284
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,581
Yeah, well,

285
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,218
at least the lady junkie
knows where his needle's been.

286
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,900
I don't even think she knows her name.

287
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,901
She knows more**

288
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:34,336
She knows everything.

289
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,172
You guys had been here for a while.

290
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,045
Where's the best place
to steal some food?

291
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:39,874
- Max!
- Sorry, sorry.

292
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,795
Classing it up.
Testicles some food.

293
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:47,554
Oh, Max, I can tell by your sassdemeanor*

294
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,814
you haven't seen your photo yet.

295
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,798
The photo.*

296
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,616
Yep, that's me, all right.

297
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,018
I recognize that "I don't care" pout

298
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,622
and the Thousand Island
dressing in my hair.

299
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:06,524
Max, just because you're hanging on a wall

300
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,427
among the poorest,
most lost souls in our city

301
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,363
doesn't mean your life is...

302
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,795
I'm hanging right behind me, aren't I?

303
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,566
Oh, my God!

304
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,569
It could be worst. You could be naked.

305
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,671
This is worse than being naked!

306
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:27,407
I'm wearing polyester!

307
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,376
It's bad ou I'm a waitress in Brooklyn.

308
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:31,644
Now I'm a waitress in Manhattan,

309
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:34,447
and these guys didn't even tip!

310
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:38,284
No, no, no, it's a photograph
so it's more symbolic.

311
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:41,179
It's called "Waitress"

312
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,866
And I'm holding a checkpad.

313
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,662
What those blue dots mean?

314
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,564
Is my picture in trouble?

315
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,734
That's how many time
your print has been purchased.

316
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:01,935
Over here, Max, away from that phatetic
blonde lady with a waitress uniform.

317
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:04,779
Could you relax?
No one even recognized you.

318
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,415
No one? What about that art critic

319
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,984
who said "my smile on the photo

320
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,920
"was a study of tragic, foolish optimism

321
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:15,257
in a hopeless, dead-end life"?

322
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,759
Oh,<i> him.</i>

323
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,680
Hopeless, dead-end life and the worse
no one buys me?

324
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,915
I'm not even a success.
It's a failure.

325
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:28,110
You're totally a sucess
as failure.

326
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,319
Then where are the blue dots , Max?

327
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,448
20 people bought you.

328
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,977

00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,988
All this time, when you looked at me,

355
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,923
I thought you saw something special,

356
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:01,659
but all you really saw was
someone reading the specials.

357
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,128
I have a question for you.

358
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,731
Okay, fine. I wear the derby

359
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:10,368
because I have a little bit of a bald spot.

360
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,071
Why didn't I sell?

361
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,006
The picture sucks.

362
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,707
One of my worst.

363
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,643
If you're still trying
to give me a compliment,

364
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:19,911
you're still failing.

365
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,079
Look, a good photograph

366
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,015
captures the truth.

367
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,784
And I guess no one really believes

368
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,220
<i>you</i> as a waitress.

369
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:34,592
That is the single nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

370
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:37,061
So it's not where you wanna be... I get it.

371
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:40,765
Look, it's taken me 50 years
to be where I am.

372
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:44,802
And you are still <i> so young.</i>

373
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,937
That is the second-nicest thing

374
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,806
anyone's ever said to me!

375
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:52,209
The road is long, and trust me,

376
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:55,479
it can be really hard.

377
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:57,348
So whatever you do,

378
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,751
you hold on to that
foolishly hopeful smile.

379
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:04,922
And... your funny friend.

380
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:07,057
- Yes?
- Yes.

381
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,894
Uh, everyone, tonight we are witness

382
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,530
to the amazing work

383
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,332
of Nola Anderz.

384
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,201
[applause]

385
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,503
Why don't we all just stand here quietly

386
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:24,508
for a moment and let Nola's pictures speak.

387
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,045
[cell phone ringing]

388
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,047
That's my phone. Where is it?

389
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,649
[ringing]

390
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:36,420
Baby, why is my phone in your bra?

391
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,188
Shh, please!

392
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,291
It's your secret phone!
I know all about it.

393
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,627
[ringing] You took it? Give it to me.

394
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:46,763
Who is she, Oleg?
Who is this skanky old whore?

395
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,899
Security! Security!

396
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,402
What... no, no, no!
Stop, stop... she has my phone.

397
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,137
It's his boner phone, everybody!

398
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,939
It's his boner phone!

399
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,977
And you had the testicles to think

400
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:03,813
I was gonna embarrass you.

401
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,286
Hey, Sophie.

402
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,720
Hey, girls.

403
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,389
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

404
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,924
It sounds a little
bit like... I don't know.

405
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,660
The sound of cheating.

406
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:19,763
You guys haven't made up yet?

407
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,197
Don't make up here.

408
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,400
No. I slept on the couch.

409
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,568
I missed her so much, I watched a romcom

410
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,072
while eating a whole box
of her edible underwear.

411
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,608
Still not talking to me, Sophie?

412
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,878
For the last time,
there's nobody else but you.

413
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,180
- I use that phone...
- Yes?

414
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:38,948
To... Go on.

415
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,584
- I use it to call...
- Cut to the chase!

416
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,653
My mother.

417
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,990
Is there no one he won't sleep with?

418
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,791
I didn't tell you because

419
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,693
I didn't want you to think
I was a mama's boy.

420
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:53,596
Except when we play "Mama and Boy."

421
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,264
Well...

422
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,066
I'll tell you what I told that girl

423
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,502
at the Yankee Candle store.

424
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,971
"I'm not buyin' it!"

425
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,106
It's true, Sophie.

426
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:07,443
I'm afraid I'm... losing my hair.

427
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,147
Oh... Oleg.

428
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,249
But don't you know...

429
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:17,253
I mean, you could be
balder than Jeremy Piven was

430
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:21,957
15 years ago, and I'd still love ya.

431
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:26,796
[phone ringing]

432
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:28,998
Where's my... [ringing]

433
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,034
Busted.

434
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:35,604
Caroline, I have something for you.

435
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,573
I'm not signing another one of those

436
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:40,576
giant birthday cards again.

437
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,182
It's my picture.

438
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:50,219
Great. Now I have two of you
that don't wait on tables.

439
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,654
"Thanks for the croutons. Nola."

440
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,823
Max, where are we gonna hang me?

441
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,625
Maybe you should hang yourself
in the bathroom

442
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:59,094
like I thought you would three years ago.

443
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:02,164
Yep. I lost $20 on that bet.

444
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,632
You know, Max,

445
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:06,101
maybe I have to stop running
away from this part of my life

446
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,637
and embrace it,
see it as part of my journey,

447
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,440
my... beautiful, exciting journey.

448
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,234
If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna hang you right here.

449
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:16,515
