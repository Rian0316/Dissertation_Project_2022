1
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:05,686
Jesus, you really don't remember
what happened last year?

2
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:09,423
Pay some fucking attention
this time.

3
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:11,391
<i>Your life's not simple, Fiona,</i>

4
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:14,428
<i>and you're nothing like anyone</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

5
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:17,397
<i>You make me want to enjoy</i>
<i>my life again.</i>

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,599
Who the hell is that?

7
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,734
My dad.

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,771
<i>In my whole career, I've never</i>
<i>seen such a spectacular display</i>

9
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,374
of alcoholism.
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:29,110
- How much are we short?
- $18.30.

11
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,746
<i>I'm take the PSATS</i>
<i>for some Polish kid.</i>

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,715
<i>Are you able to kick in,</i>
<i>like, ten more?</i>

13
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:35,616
I get paid Friday.
Okay, I'll figure out the rest.

14
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,984
<i>I can loan you the money.</i>

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:38,252
We don't need your charity.

16
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:42,590
"Fiona, thanks for a night
I'll never forget."

17
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,091
Who the fuck's Tony?

18
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,726
<i>I've waited a long time</i>

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,994
for last night to happen.

20
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:48,229
At least Tony's not coming here

21
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,296
getting all in
my family's business

22
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,465
what the fuck is wrong, Frank?!

23
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,300
Maybe that's what I want.

24
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:54,668
You know nothing about me.

25
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:56,470
Then teach me!

26
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:58,705
I'm gay.
I know.

27
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:00,975
That's for screwing my husband.

28
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,609
<i>I want another baby.</i>

29
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,077
What?
I get what I want,

30
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:05,713
and you can have what you want.

31
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,584
Put the candy back, now.

32
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:12,953
Fuck!
Shit!

33
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:14,354
I like you, Fiona.

34
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,756
You're a dirty girl, like me.

35
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,290
Jasmine, this is Veronica.

36
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,693
V lives next door.
Hiya, V.

37
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,161
<i>We're only taking in</i>
<i>a foster kid for a week</i>

38
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,530
to get the money to pay
for my stupid parking tickets.

39
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:24,831
<i>Want to go over to the park,</i>

40
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,833
throw the ol' pigskin around?

41
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:29,169
Would it be all right if
my son Jonah came? Huh?

42
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,972
I scored you a 2,200.

43
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,041
I'm an investigator for the
educational evaluation service.

44
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:37,443
This is the robotics lab.
It is the best in the country.

45
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:38,644
Come by anytime.

46
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:41,280
Science just turns me on.

47
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:42,948
What are you hiding?

48
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,352
I left them.

49
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,688
<i>Your house</i> <i>is
Frank's wet dream.</i>

50
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:51,857
<i>Never gonna get him out.</i>

51
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,693
Dad.
Son.

52
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,629
- <i>What are we?</i>
- <i>Friends.</i>

53
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:58,497
Just friends?
Friends who like to do this.

54
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,366
I knew that.

55
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,802
It says here you can
re-dedicate yourself as a virgin.

56
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,804
Oral sex, orgy,
big black strap-on dildo.

57
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,072
You whore!

58
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:07,574
<i>He humiliated me!</i>

59
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:09,342
Get out!

60
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,344
Don't ever come back!

61
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,579
You're out of the house.

62
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:14,013
I'm out of the house!

63
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:15,882
Whoa!

64
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,951
What do you think now, daddy?
Am I still a whore?

65
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,357
Frank? Frank?!

66
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,893
I think I was kind of
falling in love with her.

67
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,695
How long you been stealing cars?

68
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,329
Who says I steal them?

69
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,034
I have to leave town.
Come with me.

70
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,003
Costa Rica, it's beautiful.

71
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,271
<i>I think I might
be</i> <i>in love with him.</i>

72
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,540
<i>Scary, isn't it?</i>

73
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,843
<i>I love you.
</i> <i>I want to be with you.</i>

74
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:44,311
Come with me.

Won't be long now, Frank.

In a few days, she's gonna
make it to the store,

100
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,525
then the hair salon,
alibi room.

101
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,227

scumbag freeloading
Frank stories.

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,573
Who the hell is that?

107
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,142
Friend from group.

108
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,043
Group?

109
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:52,879
Sex addicts anonymous.

110
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,580
Gig's almost up, daddy Frank.

111
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,282
Time to make other plans.

112
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,923
One hundred!

113
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,005
Hey, cut it off, Ernie.

114
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,740
Thanks, lieutenant.

115
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:23,543
Hey, do you mind if we drop
Cami off early tomorrow?

116
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,045
Teresa's got inventory
at Costco.

117
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,513
No problem.

118
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,081
And tell Teresa thanks
for the case of dented soup.

119
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:32,351
Bye-bye, Cami. Mwah.

120
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,454
Pool's open!

121
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,303
Eddie goes to the corner
for a pack of Lucky's,

122
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,539
never heard from again.

123
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,775
Goddamn city couldn't wait
to stop paying him.

124
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,278
Wasn't two weeks before
the checks stopped coming.

125
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:59,648
And now what are we
supposed to live off of?

126
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:02,450
Sheila's single
disability check?

127
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:07,288
How does Mr. Osama-Obama
expect us to survive on that?

128
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,456
He gonna try and
tase me. I hit him.

129
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,924
If Sheila does go to work,

130
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,125
what's she going to make?

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,595
Minimum wage... at best.

132
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,464
Nobody's heard from Eddie?

133
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,966
He tases me...
Not a word.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,235
Man's got no sense
of responsibility.

135
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,005
Leaving a family of three
to fend for ourselves.

136
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,440
I got tased twice, man.

137
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:24,675
Bullshit.

138
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:28,613
What you say?

139
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,014
Uh...

140
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,483
I said bullshit!

141
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,451
I got tasered
for like a second,

142
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,852
I crapped myself.

143
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,320
There's no way
you got tasered twice,

144
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,521
fought off three cops

145
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,823
ran away.

146
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,491
You calling me a liar?

147
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:47,196
At the very least,
an exaggerator.

148
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,198
A grand says I did.

149
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,436
Kev, you still got
that taser back there?

150
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,039
I'll see your grand
and add nine more.

151
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:00,009
10,000 in American legal tender

152
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,947
says you can not
get tasered twice

153
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,715
and not soil
your tighty whities,

154
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,317
much less keep standing.

155
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,453
All right, shithead.

156
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,357
Move.

157
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:16,527
Do it.

158
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,166
Do it!

159
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,543
Again!

160
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,718
What?!

161
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:52,362
Where's my ten grand,
motherfucker?

162
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,380
Hey, gorgeous, more Diablos.

163
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,316
Oh, you think these boy scouts

164
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,583
can handle that kind
of heat, girls?

165
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,586
No.
No, not a chance.

166
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,788
Not a chance.

167
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:26,463
Six more Diablos, a JB back,
Ketel One up with a lime wedge,

168
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:27,797
Maker's Seven, and four Stellas.

169
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:30,467
Haven't given up
on that one yet?

170
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,235
Every summer needs a challenge.

171
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,071
Man's in love
with his own fabulous self.

172
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,673
Probably masturbates while he
licks his reflection

173
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:36,908
in the mirror.

174
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,943
Fiona!

175
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,647
Who's that, slutty's husband?

176
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:43,115
Uh, no. Hal's rounder.

177
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,084
Hi.
Hi.

178
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,353
Fi, this is my friend, David.

179
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:48,955
Jasmine's told me
a lot about you.

180
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:51,157
Only that you're

Breakfast!

366
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,848
I moved it.

367
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:57,384
Hey! Good morning.

368
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,920
I, uh, I can't find my watch.

369
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,321
I have looked everywhere.

370
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:02,922
It's on your wrist.

371
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,161
I had mom move
her rainy day fund

372
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,663
after what happened last time.

373
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:10,931
Karen, the omelets are ready!

374
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,565
I had nothing to do with that.

375
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,833
Hello?!

376
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,435
I hid her atm card, too,

377
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,271
so don't even try
taking that again.

378
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,850
Her nose has been running,

379
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:32,086
but I think it's just the glue

380
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,188
that Jeff's been using
on the new kitchen linoleum.

381
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:35,189
Bye, baby.

382
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,895
Oh, and please, no gluten.

383
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:40,896
Gluten?

384
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,564
Who knows.

385
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:43,932
Ooh. Hey,
there you go.

386
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,267
There's Cinderella.

387
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,768
Uh, you all set?

388
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:48,570
Yeah. Playtime, one hour.

389
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,306
Tv or <i>Bambi--</i>
Skip the dead mom part.

390
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,440

Cheetos and carrot sticks.

392
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,110
Story time, nothing scary.

393
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,578
Free play, lunch, nap,

394
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:59,914
pool, Dr. Oz, twinkies and milk,
parent pickup.

395
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:02,283
Oh, and don't wake you
unless there's blood

396
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,551
or exposed bone.

397
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,588
Lots of blood.

398
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,828
Who's ready for tv, guys?!

399
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,597

You see Kash last night?

408
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,025
No. He didn't come home again.

409
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,861
Had to open the shop by myself.

410
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,263
Homeless winos
ten deep at the door

411
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:53,766
trying to trade stolen recycling
for 40s and mad dog.

412
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,969
Uh, pack of Marlboros.

413
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:57,170
How old are you, eight?

414
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,605
Get the hell out of here.

415
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,006
You handle the store
by yourself?

416
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,808
I got to get upstairs.

417
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:04,879
The twins are going to be late
for swim team at the mosque.

418
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,480
And no free breakfast.

419
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:09,317
You come to work hungry,
you pay like everybody else.

420
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:16,324
Linda gone?

421
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:17,525
Mm-hmm.

422
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,726
Been waiting across the street

423
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,860
for an hour.

424
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,895
Mm. Late night?

425
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,363
What do you care?

426
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,032
Where the hell have you been?

427
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,567
Kash!

428
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,002
I waited up
until after midnight.

429
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:30,404
You know the doctor wants
me in bed by...

430
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,741
What are you looking at?

431
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,377
Go microwave me a burrito
and stock the cooler.

432
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:37,878
A pack of Marlboros?

433
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,154
What?!

434
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:48,756
Hey, you try
starting this thing

435
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,891
since last summer?

436
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:51,759
No.

437
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,828
Hey, how's the crop coming?
It's almost harvesttime.

438
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:55,563
But I'm a bit worried though.

439
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,332
It seems like there's
a lot more cops

440
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:58,566
in the park this summer.

441
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,201
Yeah, I'm working on it.

442
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,570
Oh.

443
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,740
I'll go chase the rats
out of the coolers.

444
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,709

Where's that,
that backpack thingy?

454

Borrowing him for what?

455
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,065
Going to take him
to the aquarium.

456
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,934
No, you're not,
it costs too much.

457
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:35,969
Okay, then, the zoo.

458
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,771
When are you bringing him back?

459
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,640
I'll bring him back
when I'm damn ready.

460
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,477
I'm his father,
we need time together.

461
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,879
Should we wake Fiona?

462
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,748
See any exposed bone?

463
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,250
Stan's yelling again,

464
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:52,918
so loud you can hear
him through the floor.

465
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:55,321
Oh, yesterday it was
Nixon and Jimmy Carter.

466
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,789
What's it today?

467
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:59,425
I turned the tv up after
"fucking colored people."

468
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,327
He keeps going
downhill like this,

469
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:03,595
you're going to have
to call Becky.

470
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:04,829
He has his good and bad days.

471
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:06,497
Bad days?

472
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,765
That's what you call trying
to take out the trash naked?

473
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,635
He forgot his pants--
it happens, all right?

474
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,771
I know you love
the old racist bastard,

475
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:15,005
but if it were my dad,

476
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,807
I'd want to know
he was going south.

477
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,442
It's probably time
for her to think

478
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:19,677
about putting him in a home.

479
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,012
I can't hear you.

480
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,282
No.

481
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:26,485
N-no, I don't want
to watch my language.

482
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,456
I've been speaking this language
for the last 50 goddamn years.

483
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,758
No, you listen to me,

484
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,794
you fucking daughter
of a chink whore.

485
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:37,430
Hello?
Goddamn cunt,

486
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:38,598
cunt, cunt.

487
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,332
She hung up on me.

488
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:43,102
The bitch didn't speak
one word of English.

489
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,336
She's probably in the basement

490
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,671
of some whorehouse in Calcutta.

491
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,674
A-and would you believe
this shit?

492
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,975
What shit?
My electric bill.

493
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,477
$8,700 bucks for electricity.

494
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:55,280
You know, I've been running
this bar for 40 years

495
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,683
and I never got a bill that
was even close to a grand.

496
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:01,153
All I want is for them
to send me one of their

497
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:04,789
taco-eating, wetback
meter readers to come here

498
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,824
and check out
the fucking thing!

499
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:10,027
Nah, that's it,
get me my shotgun.

500
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,163
I'm going to go down there
and blow the cunt's head off.

501
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:14,865
Can I see it-- The bill?
Yeah, here.

502
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:17,167
They must have
made some mistake.

503
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,703
The only mistake they made
was fucking with me.

504
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:21,872
All right, Stan, would
you please sit down?

505
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,306
Aah!
Stan, sit down before you blow

506
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:25,475
another ventricle.
Yeah, blow, blow.

507
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:26,709
I'm gonna take care
of this, all right?

508
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:28,844
Arizona's got
the right idea, boy--

509
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,212
Take 'em down to the border

510
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,916
and throw 'em
over the goddamn fence!

511
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,418
That's it.

512
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,835
Ian, cover the register.

513
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:30,710
We have a problem.

514
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:32,546
We may need to sell some pot.

515
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,780
Isn't that what we always do?

516
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:36,216
A lot of pot.

517
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:43,256
So Ethel's been helping us out.

518
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,592
You know how she told you

519
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,961
about that kick-ass worm
shit she's been using

520
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:48,962
on her tomatoes?
Yeah.

521
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:50,497
Well, it worked so good,

522
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:54,100
we decided to use it
on this year's crop.

523
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,335
You know how I usually grow

524
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,603
a couple plants

525
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:57,771
to get us through the summer?

526
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:02,944
Holy shit.

527
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:04,178
Exactly.

528
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,446
Wait, so what's the problem?

529
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,082
Forgot about the electric bill.

530
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:09,584
We need nine grand
or they're gonna shut

531
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,753
the power off to the building.

532
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,321
Isn't it wonderful?

533
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:14,589
Mr. Kevin is
going to help

534
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,592
all the old people
who are going blind.

535
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,336
God bless you.

536
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,473
Jesus loves you.

537
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,310
Fuck you, Frank.

538
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,151
- Jesus-- Oh, shit.
- Where's my money?

539
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:45,386
Okay, okay, okay, stop!

540
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,071
Back to work.

541
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:06,607
Your fly is down.

542
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:10,044
So how much do you think
you've got growing down here?

543
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,380
I don't know, a couple
hundred pounds or so.

544
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,649
I'm gonna start drying what I
can, but that won't fetch more

545
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:16,484
than a couple grand
or so by Friday.

546
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:17,886
Well, you know what?
Maybe we could, uh,

547
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,220
unload some of the plants?

548
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:20,488
Yeah, how much
would we have to sell?

549
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:21,723
Five maybe,

550
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:23,358
six?

551
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:26,761
Lip, who the hell around here
has two grand for a plant?

552
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,196
I might know a guy.

553
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,198
V's going to kill me.

554
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,433
She's going to fucking kill me.

555
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,701
I promised her
that I wouldn't sell

556
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:36,037
more than three or four
this year.

557
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,705
Normally I throw
a bunch of seeds around,

558
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,242
see which looks best,
thin out the rest,

559
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:44,212
but this year I couldn't.

560
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:47,282
They're all so beautiful,
I just...

561
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:49,719
I just couldn't do it.

562
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,724
Where's my fucking money?

563
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,026
That was great last night.

564
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,127
You were having fun,
I was having fun.

565
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,229
Where's my fucking money?

566
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,064
You were serious about that?

567
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,433
Get me the goddamn tin snips.

568
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,402
I-if, if I had won, I wouldn't
expect you to pay me.

569
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,038
Take off his shoes.

570
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:08,406
But...

571
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:11,243
It's a turn of phrase,
like, uh, uh,

572
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,878
"I bet it's going
to rain today."

573
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:14,112
Yeah, let me tell you
something,

574
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:15,414
if I don't get

575
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:17,549
my fucking money,
I'm cutting toes off

576
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,251
and cauterizing 'em
with a blowtorch.

577
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:20,485
You got my panhandling cash.

578
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,787
60 bucks, man?!

579
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,289
I was only out there
for 45 minutes!

580
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,428
We'll keep the kid.

581
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:31,096
Yeah, as collateral.

582
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,464
Come back with
my fucking money,

583
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:33,765
you get the kid.

584
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,433
I-I-I'll bring
you your money,

585
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:36,968
but you can't keep the kid.

586
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,303
You can't keep Liam.

587
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,272
I'll get you your money--
We can work this out.

588
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:43,008
Oh, we just did.
No, no, no, no, no, absolutely you can't...

589
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:48,180
Light it up, get him up.

590
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:53,319
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

591
00:27:53,353 --> 00:27:54,620
okay.

592
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:56,655
Keep Liam.

593
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,096
Get up out of here.

594
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,571
I'll be back, buddy,
I promise you.

595
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,612
Well... excuse me.
I gotta go.

596
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:22,048
Hey.

597
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:24,784
Gaga, Adele, Rikki,
J.Lo, Nicki Minaj.

598
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:26,019
Even threw in some old Maxwell.

599
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,487
My guaranteed

600
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,689
clitoris-moistening
aphrodisiac music mix.

601
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:31,157
I hope so.

602
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:33,326
All she ever wants to do
is discuss the lake poets.

603
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,794
And who the fuck is Bruno Mars?

604
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:37,196
May be time to give up on
the 22-year-old grad students,

605
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,497
start banging in
your own decade.

606
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,199
22-year-old
grad students

607
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,467
is the reason
I got into teaching.

608
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,801
I'm too old to start over now.

609
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:44,035
Hey, you got my SIM board?

610
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,303
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,638
Thank you.

612
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:47,872
Hey, any interest

613
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,907
in purchasing a
six-foot-tall pot plant?

614
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,575
Chicks love an old
dude with great weed.

615
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,843
Yeah, how much?

616
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:54,411
Uh, a couple grand.
Pricey.

617
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,046
It's primo stuff.

618
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,414
What the hell is that anyway?

619
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:59,249
It's a cop locator.

620
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:00,718
Rigging up a GPS system

621
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:02,986
that uses police frequencies
for coordinates.

622
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,421
Shows me where all the cops are

623
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,890
in a given area
at any given time.

624
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,758
Is that even legal?

625
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,761
What, trying to make sure
our community is receiving

626
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,229
its fair share of law
enforcement resources?

627
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,530
Why not?

628
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,700
Listen, I-I got
a lunch date, I got to go.

629
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,001
Oh, with who, David Petraeus?

630
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:17,402
No, I landed

631
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:19,371
a department of defense grant.

632
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,273
Micro-robotics surveillance
drone prototypes.

633
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:24,177
Yeah? Yeah, well, who knows
if it'll work, but it'll put

634
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:26,413
some government-issued pork
in my pocket.

635
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:29,183
Listen, why don't
you help us with it?

636
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,551
I could probably wrangle you

637
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,687
some ap engineering
or physics credits.

638
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:34,221
Ah, no, thanks.

639
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:35,423
You're gonna have to
figure out how to blow up

640
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:36,690
Afghan shepherds
all on your own.

641
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,459
All right.

642
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:46,298
What are you doing?

643
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,368
Making a little easy summer
moola the Gallagher way.

644
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,303
Where's Liam?
In the car.

645
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:52,705
You don't have a car.

646
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,040
A friend's car.

647
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,107
You crack a window?

648
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:56,575
Left the engine running

649
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:57,910
for the ac.

650
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:00,412
You left a toddler
in a running car

651
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:02,415
in this neighborhood?

652
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:06,053
That baby laxative?

653
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:07,888
This, my young progeny,

654
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:09,957
is Dr. Frank's
magic moneymaking

655
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,258
fun dust.
Oregano?

656
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:12,860
Fool's gold.

657
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,032
My I've-never-seen-it-fail
summer solstice atm.

658
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,845
<i>Hey, maybe we can talk</i>
<i>the electric company</i>

659
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,813
<i>into taking a down payment,</i>

660
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,147
<i>you know, payment plan</i>
<i>kind of deal.</i>

661
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:37,017
Oh, watch, customers.

662
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:40,453
- Hey, what's going on?
- Uh, can I get a watermelon bob-pop,

663
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:44,623
bubble gum snow cone,
and a chocolate crunch?

664
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,757
You still selling loosies?

665
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,626
Uh, yeah, Marlboro lights--
Buck apiece.

666
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:52,463
What can I get you, champ?
Lemon-lime shot,

667
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:53,997
chocolate chip cookie bar,
and a Molson's.

668
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,465
Molson's?

669
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,467
We sell American beer
here to children of age.

670
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,802
Come back for a bud
light when you're 16.

671
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,303
Two frozen snickers,

672
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:03,974
a bag of beer nuts,
and a couple of joints.

673
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,609
You 14? Got ID?

674
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:09,145
What's your birthday?

675
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,113
June 3, 1997.

676
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:14,050
Okay.

677
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,284
There you go.

678
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,953
Hey.

679
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,488
You taking little league book
like you did last year?

680
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:20,356
Absolutely, what do you want?
Marlins.

681
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,192
U10 or u12?

682
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:23,527
U10 for $15.

683
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,828
You're not worried
about that Ratkovich?

684
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,697
Kid threw 72 pitches yesterday.

685
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:28,065
Nah. He's Dominican.

686
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
Hey, Lip,
anything on this radar?

687
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:31,469
Ah...

688
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:32,904
Nope. Closest unit

689
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:35,539
is a foot patrol
over by the play structure.

690
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,574
Sorry I'm late. I
slept through my alarm.

691
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:40,376
Yeah, I came by last night,
waited around for a while.

692
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:43,379
Well, I didn't get
in till 4:00 A.M.

693
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:45,381
New guy?
Jody.

694
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,216
He's nice.

695
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,217
I don't know. We got to
talking about music yesterday,

696
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:51,586
and he showed me a bunch of
bands I've never heard of.

697
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,188
My favorite was
called Guns N' Roses.

698
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:54,723
Guns N' Roses?

699
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,357
How old is Jody?

700
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:58,159
Uh, 37, I think.

701
00:31:58,194 --> 00:32:00,762
You know, he laid out
a blanket in the park,

702
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:02,431
and we listened to his iPod,

703
00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:04,333
and fell asleep in
each others' arms.

704
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,535
Wow. Sex any good?

705
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,004
No sex. It's a part

706
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:09,739
of this whole
Sex Addicts Anonymous thing.

707
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:11,708
Right, but you're a teenager.
I mean, all teenagers

708
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:13,343
are sex addicts.

709
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,778
Yeah, but I've been having sex
since I was 11.

710
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,247
I don't know. Jody and
I don't want the physical

711
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,781
to complicate things for us.

712
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:23,885
Yeah, but we can still get,
uh, complicated, right?

713
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,021
Sure, I guess.

714
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,057

00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:20,299
This is Mexican cartel, 60 years
in the federal slammer pot.

898
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,268
Wait, wait. What are you
talking about? Destroy it?

899
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:25,071
Kevin, there's a couple of tons
of weed down here, and I'm black.

900
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,105
Well, what about
the electric bill?

901
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:27,339
We'll figure something out,

902
00:41:27,374 --> 00:41:29,008
dip into our savings, but this?

903
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,909
This shit's got to be
mulch by tomorrow.

904
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:34,045
To-fucking-morrow.

905
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,450
Frank?

906
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:40,486
Frank, where have you been?

907
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,920
I've been worried sick.

908
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:43,422
You didn't come home for dinner.

909
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:44,957
I have done everything
I can think of,

910
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,026
and I still didn't make
enough money today.

911
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,161
Oh.

912
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:52,499
Well, I, I have
$80 in my purse.

913
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:54,534
No, that's,

914
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:57,002
that's not-- Well, sure.

915
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:04,277
I think I might have really
screwed up this time.

916
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:11,517
It's been crazy
exciting to see these cubs

917
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:13,152
following their mom like this.

918
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:15,989
The marsh pride nursery has been

919
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:18,057
so cool to watch this week.

920
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:19,559
These cubs are
five weeks old now

921
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:21,428
and ready to rock off
to a new den.

922
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:26,667
Debbie?

923
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:27,901
No Liam.

924
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:29,837
Frank didn't bring him back?

925
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:37,978
Where the hell is he?

926
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:42,082
Frank!

927
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:43,717
Frank! Frank!

928
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:47,856
Where's Liam?

929
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:55,931
Hey.

930
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:58,067
Where is

931
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,036
Liam?

932
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,206
He's at his first sleepover.

933
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,541
He's two!

934
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,209
They sleep a lot at that age.

935
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,383
Which way?

936
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:26,996
This one?

937
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,670
Who the fuck are you?

938
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:38,073
We want Liam back.

939
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:38,974
Liam stays.

940
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:40,376
He's collateral.

941
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,945
Then you better start shooting.

942
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,119
Hey, good to see you.
Man, shut the fuck up.

943
00:43:55,124 --> 00:43:57,292
How much is that?

944
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:58,794
I don't know,
but we're good for it.

945
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:00,329
Gallaghers pay their debts.

946
00:44:00,363 --> 00:44:02,798
Now, where the hell
is our brother?

947
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:10,640
Okay, home sweet home.

948
00:44:10,675 --> 00:44:11,908
Good night, buddy,

949
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,143
love you.
Love you, bud.

950
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:16,479
I'm sorry, Fiona.

951
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,150
It's not your fault.

952
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:24,852
Get some sleep, okay?

953
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:37,865
I didn't mean for that to...

954
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,468
It was a joke, you know?

955
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:42,871
I was in the bar,
I made this stupid...

956
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:55,785
I tried to make
enough that I...

957
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,334
♪ ♪

958
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:36,892
Ian.
Oh, yeah.

959
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,999
Yo, Freddie, what you got today,
aluminum or plastic?

960
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,702
Ian, tell Kash to get
his ass up here. I need him.

961
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:49,171
Now, Ian.

962
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Don't worry about it.

963
00:45:59,082 --> 00:46:01,083
Hey, Kash,
Linda's looking for you.

964
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,721
Kash.

965
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,859
Can you do me

966
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,894
a favor, Ian?

967
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:13,296
Can you give me
a bit of a head start?

968
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,598
You're leaving?

969
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:17,733
Linda's got preeclampsia.

970
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,769
The ob wants her in bed
for the rest of her pregnancy.

971
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:22,905
I can't do it.

972
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:27,443
An hour, two, please.

973
00:46:28,478 --> 00:46:31,180
What do I tell your kids?

974
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:46,327
Been to bed yet?

975
00:46:46,362 --> 00:46:48,596
You're not going
to believe the night I had.

976
00:46:49,998 --> 00:46:51,098
Kids up yet?

977
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:54,368
Think I may need
some field hands.

978
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:58,739
We handed over all the cash that
we'd made so far this summer

979
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:00,641
and we still owe him,
like, six grand.

980
00:47:00,675 --> 00:47:02,843
That's the money that we count
on to get us through the winter.

981
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:04,612
Well, what was it,
some kind of bet?

982
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:06,813
Oh, ten grand,
you believe that?

983
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:08,749
Now we'll be lucky if we can bank
enough to get us to Christmas.

984
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,685
Yeah, hey, V, can we
at least save some for

985
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,787
the ice cream truck, you know,
keep it stocked all summer?

986
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,856
How much is that?
One bag should do it.

987
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,624
All right, but
less than an ounce

988
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:17,859
on the truck at one time.

989
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:19,661
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

990
00:47:19,695 --> 00:47:21,530
Sure, take a bag.

991
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,832
It's the least we can do to
thank you for your hard work.

992
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:25,167
No, no,

993
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:26,635
not you, Johnny appleseed.

994
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,982
Carl, stop pushing.

995
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:42,518
And don't bite.

996
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,554
Hold it...

997
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,356
Babe, you got it?

998
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:51,128
All right, that it?

999
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:53,297
So they don't fall.

1000
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:54,798
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

1001
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,033
Peace.
Thank you.

1002
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,301
Bye, Veronica.

1003
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,337
Bye, baby,
I'll see you later, okay?

1004
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,672
All right, so now what?

1005
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:03,173
To the dump, I guess.

1006
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,576
Seems like such a waste.
You got

1007
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,743
any better ideas?

1008
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:19,424
You looking for Karen?

1009
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,825
Yeah, I am.

1010
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,762
She went to the store.

1011
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:25,864
You Lip?
Mm-hmm.

1012
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:27,866
Jody.

1013
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:34,039
Nice shirt.

1014
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:50,388
Should about do it.

1015
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,728
Shit.

1016
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:06,272
Well, good afternoon,
sleepyhead.

1017
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,707
Where's breakfast?

1018
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:09,542
Oh, it's way too late
for breakfast.

1019
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,710
You even missed lunch.

1020
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:12,746
I'm not

1021
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,514
a short-order cook, sweetie.

1022
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,952
So... I'm off for my walk.

1023
00:49:19,986 --> 00:49:22,288
108 steps today is the goal.

1024
00:49:22,322 --> 00:49:25,791
I might even make it
to the mailbox.

1025
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:29,661
There's lucky charms
in the pantry

1026
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:31,630
and milk in the fridge.

1027
00:49:31,665 --> 00:49:33,665
Okay,

1028
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
bye.

1029
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:48,515
Great looking tomatoes.

1030
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:50,484
Heirlooms?
Yes, they are, cherokee purples.

1031
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:52,319
Hope I can talk you

1032
00:49:52,354 --> 00:49:54,755
- out of a couple when they're ripe.
- Of course.

1033
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,823
It's all in the compost.

1034
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:57,191
I can give you some worms

1035
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,258
to get you started.

1036
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:59,759
Really? That'd be great.

1037
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:01,461
I was thinking I should start a garden.
You should.

1038
00:50:01,495 --> 00:50:02,829
I'll go change, grab a shovel.

1039
00:50:02,863 --> 00:50:05,498
Hey, Tony.

1040
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:25,451

Be happy with anything
under six.

On your mark,

1043
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:37,063
get set.

1044
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:39,165
