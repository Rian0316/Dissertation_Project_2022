你再犯一次就三振出局
This is both strike one and strike two.

38

霍華德不能因為我做的事
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

39
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,560
就把你弄來復審文件
because of something I did.

40
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,810
我告訴過你后果就是這樣
I told you this would happen.

41
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,730

你就像個酒鬼拒絕承認自己有毛病

她覺得整個章節都是她的似的
She takes the whole section for granted.

我還在糾結要不要跟她說
I'm debating ‭whether to say something.

這很難說
Mm. Well, it's debatable.

舒伯特那部分還不錯
I mean, the Schubert is coming along nicely.

66
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,180
主要是士氣的問題
It's more about morale.

67

士氣會影響質量
Morale can affect quality.

那也關系到你的名聲  不是嗎
It's your reputation, too, you know?

222
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,750
我們周一先從柴可夫斯基開始
Well, we start the Tchaikovsky on monday,

我看看結束時她的狀態怎么樣
so I'll see what kind of mood she's in when we wrap.

聰明

What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement?

抱歉  我沒打算嚇你一跳
Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

你扔掉了一個易拉罐
You threw away a soda can.

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,060
你翻了我的垃圾
You're going through my trash?

242
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,830
沒有
No.

243
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,050
我只是午休時進去送文件
I was just dropping off papers at lunchtime,

244
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,930
無意中看到它在你的垃圾筒里
and I happened to notice it in your trash can.

245
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,700
我把它拿出來了  沒事了
I fished it out, so it's fine.

246
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,670
辦公室的垃圾筒是扔可回收紙張的
Office cans ‭are for recyclable paper --

247
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,810
廚房里有個單獨的大垃圾桶用來放塑料
there's a separate big can in the kitchen for plastic,

248
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,100
玻璃和鋁金屬
glass, and aluminum.

249
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,450
我們這里十分重視生態足跡
We take our ecological footprint pretty seriously here.

250
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,910
好吧  也就是說
okay, so, the big can

251
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,600
大垃圾桶是扔我的威士忌酒瓶的地方
is where I should throw my empty Scotch bottles.

252
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,330
我明白的
No, I-I get it.

253
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,710

254
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,960
好了  還有別的事嗎
Good. Was there anything else?

255
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,890
是的  還有一件小事
Yeah, one quick thing.

256
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,910
我這里有你早上給克利福德的簡報
I have the brief you gave Cliff this morning --

257
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,150
原告對被告動議的反對
the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion?

258
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,080
我做了幾個批注
I have a few notes.

259
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,440
應該挺清楚了
I think they're pretty clear,

260
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,020
但如果我們能一起看一遍可能更輕松點
but it's probably easier if we just go over them together.

261
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,380
天啊  那是克利福德的批注
Jesus. Th-those are Cliff's?

262
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,710
不  是我的批注
No, they're my notes.

263
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,840
如果你有時間的話  咱們現在就過一遍吧
I'd love go to over them now, if you have a minute.

264
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,170
其實沒看上去這么糟
It looks worse than it is.

265
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,650
只是...我們有特有的版式
It's -- it's just that we have a particular house style.

266
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,520
無意冒犯
Okay, no offense,

267
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,920
不過  你是剛來兩年的員工吧
But, uh, you're a second-year associate, right?

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,490
-是的  -我有四年了
- Yep. ‭- And I came in as a fourth-year.

269
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,400
沒錯
That's right.

270
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,660
那為什么一個兩年員工要給四年員工做批注
So, why is a second-year giving notes to a fourth-year?

271
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,250
就像我說的  我清楚版式要求
Well, like I said, I know the house style.

272
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,410
是克利福德派你來當我保姆的嗎
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?

273
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,260
不是
No.

274
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,990
這只是同事之間互相幫助
This is just one associate helping another.

275
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,380
比如這里  羅馬數字標題
Like here, ‭the Roman numeral headings --

276
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,930
全都要大寫
we use all caps for those.

277
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,410
你用的是縮進  這當然沒問題
And you indented them, which is perfectly fine,

278
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,200
不過克利福德更喜歡居中
but Cliff likes them centered.

279
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320
差點忘了
Oh, and before I forget,

280
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,870
所有文件中  在句號后面都要空兩格
we put two spaces after a period on all our documents.

281
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,470
這的確不是什么大事
I know it seems like a minor thing,

282
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,160
但這樣頁面會整潔得多
but really looks so much cleaner on the page.

283
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,370
你所做的引述有點多
You went a tad overboard with the quotations.

284
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,270
引用主導性法律意見是沒問題的
It's okay to present a quote from a controlling legal opinion,

285
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,610
但如果你引用過多
but when you use too many,

286
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,040
它會打亂你論述的節奏
it disrupts ‭the flow of your argument,

287
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,740
而且讓人感覺
and it gives the impression

288
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,570
你沒法獨立寫作論述
you don't know how to write an argument of your own.

289
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,220
你當然知道怎么寫
‭And I'm sure you do, so...

290
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,890
你有過度使用"顯然"  "無疑"之類詞的傾向
‭You have a tendency to overuse the words "Clearly" and "Obviously."

291
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,130
這又是個人見解的問題...
Again, it's a matter of personal opinion --

292
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,250
我真的很感激  艾琳
I really appreciate this, Erin,

293
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,690
但是  我正打算出去
But, uh, ‭I was just on my way out.

294
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,250
我們能不能明天一早再繼續討論
So, if we could continue this first thing tomorrow morning...

295
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,460
我覺得我們應該現在就看完
Well, I was thinking we should just get 'er done now.

296
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,750
分秒必爭啊
No time like the present.

297
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,220
當然
Sure.

298
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,970
讓我們卷起袖子  大干一場吧
Let's roll up our sleeves and apply a little elbow grease.

299
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,680

So, I'm gonna get my favorite pen,

301
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,910

Guys, I'm not your supervisor.

308
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,220
這不是我的專長
This is not my area of expertise, all right?

321
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,580
所以首先要做的
So, first order of business --

322
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,810
我們要找一個專門處理勞工法的律師
we get a great employment-law attorney.

323
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,450
讓他們知道我們是認真的
Show 'em we mean business.

324
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,550
說真的
‭Come on.

325
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,990
你看看你
Hey, look at you. ‭

326
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,940
你半夜還在這看似榮耀實則監獄的地方
Okay, you're here at midnight in this glorified cellblock

327
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,910
努力工作  是為了什么
busting your ass -- for what?

328
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,610
跟你的表現一點關系也沒有
It has nothing to do with your performance.

329
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,910
你受到了不公對待
You're being mistreated.

330
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,770
查克是通過懲罰你來牽制我
Chuck is punishing you to get to me.

331
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,000
這是敲詐  簡單明了
This is extortion, pure and simple.

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,540
不  是霍華德要維護形象
No, that's Howard, ‭who has an image to uphold.

333
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,510
凱特爾曼案慘敗后他也這么做的
He did the same thing after the Kettleman fiasco,

334
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,570
查克也沒有干預
and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

335
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,450
我告訴你  查克就是罪魁禍首
I'm telling you -- Chuck is behind this.

336
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,000
不  你才是罪魁禍首
No, you are behind this.

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,910
我告訴過你后果  現在我就在付出代價
I told you this would happen, and now I'm paying the price.

338
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,890
我要是早知道就好了
I shoulda known better.

339
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,110
現在我要保持低調  熬過去
So now I'm keeping my head down, and I'm getting through this.

340
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,410
而且我肯定不會起訴哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.

341
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,540
-金  -就算我勝訴了  誰還會雇傭我
- Kim - Even if I won, who would hire me?

342
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,950
那是自斷前程的行為
That would be career suicide.

343
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,130
好吧
All right.

344
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,160
那我退出戴維斯梅因律所
Then I quit Davis & Main.

345
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
那有什么用
What does that accomplish?

346
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,190
這是唯一可以讓你脫離困境的方法
It's the only way to get you outta dutch

347
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,740
因為這和查克有關
because this is about Chuck,

348
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,370
不管你信不信
whether you want to believe it or not.

349
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,200
我給他想要的  他就會寬恕你
I give him what he wants -- he lets up on you.

350
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,670
我的白馬王子
My knight in shining armor.

351
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,740
真是不小的犧牲啊
That is some sacrifice --

352
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,730
辭掉你一開始就在毀掉的工作
Quitng a job that you've been trying to tank since day one.

353
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,970
不是這樣的
That's not true.

354
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,650
我自己想辦法脫離困境
I dig myself out of this hole.

355
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,300
你做你的工作  吉米
You do your job, Jimmy.

356
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,340
向我證明你可以做到一周  不  一天
Prove you can go one week -- hell, one day --

357
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,100
不違反新墨西哥律師協會的規則
without breaking the rules of the New Mexico Bar Association

358
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,630
或者不惹你老板生氣
or pissing off your boss.

359
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,110
還有不要侮辱我的智商
And don't insult my intelligence

360
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,660
說這么做都是為了我
by saying you are doing any of this for me.

361
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,600
你救不了我
You don't save me.

362
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,700
我才能救自己
I save me.

363
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,460
請你走吧
Just please go.

364
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,630
{\an8}世上第二棒的律師

365
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,260
艾琳在嗎
Hey, is Erin in yet?

366
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,490
該死的煩人鬼
God damn pixie ninja.

367
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,850
實在對不起
I owe you a big apology.

368
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,060
我生了一個病...
I have a medical condition --

369
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,750
胃食管反流病
Gerd, ‭gastroesophageal reflux disease.

370
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,530
我知道  很繞口對不對
I know -- it's a mouthful, right?

371
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,410
它會影響下食道括約肌
It affects ‭the lower esophageal sphincter.

372
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,190
我昨天午餐時冒險吃了些洋蔥圈
I took a risk yesterday at lunch with some onion rings,

373
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,860
然后昨晚...
and last night --

374
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,160
我們還要不要工作
Are we doing this or not?

375
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,080

You bet.

我受寵若驚

在這里就是這么辦事的
That's how it works here --

-給我  -不能這樣
- Give me -- - That's not how it works.

466

提交文件  確定日期  就這樣

你懂不懂什么叫略施巧計啊
What don't you understand about finessing?

468

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,560
一個四年律師爭取到了二十五萬的活兒
Fourth-year associate snags a quarter of a million in billings?

618
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,120
她自己可能也在喝酒慶祝呢
She's probably having a couple of drinks herself.

619
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,370
我猜  她應該再次受到重用吧
She's out of the doghouse, I assume?

620
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,940
再說吧
We'll see.

621
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,640
跨州擴張  這案子很復雜
Interstate expansion -- it's a complex case.

622
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,470
我們可能要對付兩個  甚至三個監管委員會
That's two, maybe three regulatory commissions we'll be dealing with

623
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,730
律所可能得忙上幾個月  甚至幾年
Months of work for HHM, maybe years.

624
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,650
早上好  魯道夫
Good morning, Rudolpho.

625
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,870
早上好  麥吉爾先生
Good morning, Mr. McGill.

626
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,240
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

627
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,510
我不知道這兒有人
I didn't know anyone was here.

628
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,340
我來送些磯鷂渡的材料
Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff.

629
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,550
你來早了
You're in early.

630
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,740
其實是待晚了
More like late.

631
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,200
不管現在幾點  見到你真高興
Well, regardless of the hour, good to see you here.

632
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,910
我在做些新嘗試
Yeah, ‭I'm trying something new.

633
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,330
我來這一直工作到早九點
I'm coming in, working until 9:00.

634
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,690
律所開門之前辦公更容易
It's easier before the place opens,

635
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,770
燈還沒亮  電話也不會響個不停
without all the lights and the phones ringing.

636
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,160
想喝點咖啡嗎
How about some coffee?

637
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,760
不用了  謝謝
No, thank you.

638
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,800
那你能幫我泡點咖啡嗎
W-would you mind making me some?

639
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,340
對不起
I apologize.

640
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,610
我沒法自己做
It's just I-I can't do it myself,

641
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,450
我不能碰電器
what with the electricity.

642
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,400
-好  -不加糖
- Sure. ‭- No sugar.

643
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,270
稍微加點豆奶
Just a splash of soy milk.

644
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,490
應該有
I think we have it.

645
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,030
金
Kim?

646
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,070
泡兩杯
Um, make two cups.

647
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,670
他們應該說得對
Well, I guess it's true what they say --

648
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,080
早起的鳥兒有蟲吃  如果你喜歡蟲子的話
The early bird gets the worm, which is good if you like worms.

649
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,660
我能問個問題嗎
May I ask you a question?

650
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,800
當然
Of course.

651
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,230
我在這家律所有前途嗎
Do I have a future at this firm?

652
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,500
你我有很多共同點
We have a lot in common, you and I.

653
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,760
我弟弟讓你獨自承擔責任
My brother left you holding the bag.

654
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,540
要知道
If it makes you feel any better,

655
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,570
你不是第一個為他擔風險的人
you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.

656
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,700
我總是反復犯同樣的錯誤
I made the same mistake over and over again.

657
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,020
結果現在霍華德也犯了
And now Howard has...

658
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,350
他怨你
And he blames you.

659
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,960
真是一團亂
It's a damned mess.

660
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,250
吉米跟你說過我們的爸爸的事嗎
Jimmy ever tell you anything about our father?

661
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,640
沒怎么說過
Not much, no.

662
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,790
我爸爸  我們的爸爸  他是
My dad -- our dad -- he was --

663
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,270
典型的好人
well... the personification of good.

664
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,080
我都不知道他能不能看見任何罪惡
I'm not sure he could even see sin in any form,

665
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,230
他似乎就沒這個基因
like he was born without the gene.

666
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,800
他在西塞羅市經營一家街角小店
He ran a little corner store in Cicero --

667
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,330
賣賣煙草  散裝糖果
cigarettes behind the counter, penny candy --

668
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,870
沒什么特別的  但是能維持家用
nothing special, ‭but it kept food on the table.

669
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,440
鄰居們都很喜歡他
And the neighborhood loved dad.

670
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,050
他叫得出每個人的名字  了解他們的生活
He knew everybody's name, what was going on in their lives.

671
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,570
他讓這個小小的拐角變得更好
This little corner -- he made it better.

672
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,440
我是以他的名字命名的
I was named after him.

673
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,760
在那之前  他在很多人手下工作過
Before that, he'd worked for a lot of people over the years,

674
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,470
他的夢想就是自己當老板
and his dream was to be his own boss --

675
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,560
傾其所有開了這個小店
put everything he had into that place.

676
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
他讓吉米在店里干活兒的時候我在外面上大學
I was away at college when he put Jimmy to work there.

677
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,570
吉米從小就在店里  看著爸爸長大
Jimmy grew up in that store, watching our father.

678
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,440
但我爸不善經營
But dad was not the world's greatest businessman,

679
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,900
最終資金周轉不靈
and eventually, ‭he ran into money troubles.

680
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,080
那時候我在當法庭書記員
I, um, ‭had a clerkship at the time,

681
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,400
但我還是回家去幫他理清賬目
but I came home to help him get his books in order,

682
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,810
解決問題
set the ship straight.

683
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,710
我不是會計
Now, I'm no accountant,

684
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:13,690
可我發現少了一萬四千塊
but I discovered $14,000 was just gone.

685
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,960
就在這些年里無緣無故消失了
Vanished over the years.

686
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,340
結果是吉米陸陸續續偷的
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it in dribs and drabs --

687
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,790
直接從收銀臺拿的
just took it out of the till.

688
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,440
我爸聽不進去
My dad wouldn't hear it.

689
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,480
不可能  不是他的吉米干的
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

690
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,690
最后他只能賣了那小店
He ended up having to sell.

691
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,220
半年后  他去世了
Six months later, he was dead.

692
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,870
葬禮上  吉米哭得撕心裂肺
At the funeral, ‭no one cried harder than Jimmy.

693
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,130
我弟弟不是壞人
My brother is not a bad person.

694
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,680
他本性善良
He has a good heart.

695
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,490
只是
It's just...

696
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,170
他控制不住自己
...he can't help himself.

697
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,170
所以只能大家幫他收拾爛攤子
And everyone's left picking up the pieces.

698
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,140
還有咖啡嗎
Is there any coffee left?

699
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,830
不  我來吧
No, I got it.

700
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,500
我會跟霍華德談談
I'll talk to Howard,

701
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,130
幫你們調解調解
pour a little oil on troubled waters.

702
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,770
讓你在下面復審文件太大材小用了
You're being wasted down in doc review.

703
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,480
梅薩維德銀行的業務拉得好
Good job with Mesa Verde.

704
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,310
{\an8}請進  正在營業  今天沒活  回家睡覺

705
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,170
我能坐這嗎
Mind if I join you?

706
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,370
你好
Hi.

707
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,640
需要點什么嗎
What can I get you?

708
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,300
咖啡  清咖
Coffee -- black.

709
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,210
馬上就來
Coming right up.

710
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,160
他是把你揍得挺慘的
He really did a number on you.

711
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,460
抱歉  我認識你嗎
Sorry. I know you?

712
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,390
打你的那個年輕人
The young man who did that to you.

713
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,480
他是我侄子  一直都這么莽撞
He's my nephew -- ‭hothead, always has been.

714
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,560
以為自己是個拳擊手
Kid thinks he's a boxer.

715
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,800
他應該尊重你
He should have shown you respect.

716
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,450
我代表我們全家向你道歉
I apologize to you on behalf of my family.

717
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,090
接受道歉
Apology accepted.

718
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,100
你知道嗎
And you know what?

719
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,630
他是該進監獄  這對他再好不過
He should go to jail -- best thing for him.

720
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,190
讓他學會尊重長輩
Teach him respect for his elders.

721
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,360
但是  用不著待八年
But... not for eight years --

722
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,730
應該少好幾年
less, much less.

723
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,060
你懂我的意思嗎
You see what I'm getting at?

724
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,490
不怎么懂
Not really.

725
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,550
非法持有槍支  得判八年  可能十年
The gun charge -- that's 8 years he's going away, maybe 10.

726
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,570
重度攻擊  非法持槍  還搶了你的錢包
Aggravated assault, the gun, plus he got your wallet.

727
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,750
沒錯
That's right.

728
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,860
我希望你能告訴警方
I would like for you to tell the police

729
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,740
槍是你的
that the gun was yours.

730
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,670
是嗎
Would you?

731
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,730
他懷疑你撞了他的車
You're both ‭a little hot under the collar

732
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,380
你們倆都沒控制住情緒
about whether ‭you bumped his car or not.

733
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,490
你們扭打了起來  然后他搶了你的槍
But there was a scuffle, and, uh, he got your gun.

734
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,180
我的槍
My gun?

735
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,120
他從你的口袋里拿了你的槍
Your gun from your pocket -- he got it,

736
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,280
所以槍上有他的指紋
and that's how his prints got on it.

737
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,230
那我就要面臨非法持槍的指控了
And then I'd be subject to the gun charge.

738
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,010
你當過警察
You're an ex-cop.

739
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,240
他們不會為難你
They'll go easy on you.

740
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,040
原來你還知道別人怎么想
So you're a psychic.

741
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,070
我會擰著屠庫的耳朵讓他給你道歉
I'll even twist Tuco's ear, make him apologize.

742
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,210
他的罪名只有毆打他人  沒有其他的了
And he serves for battery -- nothing else.

743
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,670
這結果對大家都是最好的
I'm looking for the best possible outcome for everybody.

744
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,430
至于你的麻煩
And for your trouble...

745
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,420
給你五千塊
you take home $5,000.

746
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,890
好好考慮一下
Think about it.

24
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,910
