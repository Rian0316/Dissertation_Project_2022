1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,660
嘿 我看到有人发明了一种办法
Hey, I read that someone invented a way

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,080
可以将走路的能量转化成电磁能
to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
这样就一边走一边能给手机充电了
so you can charge your cell phone while walking.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,850
我们几年前就想到了这主意
We had that idea years ago.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,240
怎么就没有进一步研究呢?
How come we never did anything with it?

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,770
也许是因为我们把图落在了餐厅
Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant,

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,190
没一个愿意走回去取
and none of us wanted to walk back.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,830
我知道你不进一步研究的真正原因
I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,300
你是在2007年
You thought of it

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
9月22日想到的
September 22, 2007.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,750
两天后 Penny搬了进来
Two days later, Penny moved in,

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,840
你的血液都跑去生殖器了
and so much blood rushed to your genitals,

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,670
所以大脑就空了
your brain became a ghost town.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,480
不是这么回事
That's not what happened.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,310
我记得很清楚
I remember it distinctly

16
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,600
是因为我刚写完每年一次
because I had just composed my annual poem

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
纪念苏斯博士逝世周年的诗歌
commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
{\an8}苏斯博士: 著名儿童作品作家

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,730
没人想听
No one wants to hear it.

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,240
为什么会死?
Why, die.

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,770
为什么他会死?
Why did he die?

22
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,110
老了 说了
Old, told.

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,110
我听说他老了
I was told he was old.

24
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,440
Penny不是我没有深入研究的原因
Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,580
真的? 那认识她以后
Oh, really? Since meeting her,

26
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,750
你最大的成就是什么?
what have been your greatest accomplishments?

27
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,780
简单
Easy.

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,830
和Penny上床
Sleeping with Penny.

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,620
在Penny甩了他之后 把她争取了回来
Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.

30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,920
骗Penny订婚
Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,960
几个星期前 他差点做成一个引体向上
And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,260
我觉得有人该道歉
I think someone owes me an apology.

33
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,680
别自责
Well, don't feel bad.

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,800
我觉得在姑娘们进入我们生活后
I think we've all been distracted

35
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,520
我们都被分神了
since the girls entered our lives.

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,440
你承认Amy让你分神了?
You admit Amy's a distraction?

37
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,940
太分神了 听听这个
Oh, very much so. Listen to this.

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,060
两天前收到的
This is from two days ago.

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,700
"嗨 希望你今天愉快"
"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,980
有谁会一直这样短信调情?
Who has time for this constant sexting?

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,490
也许我们分散了注意力
Well, maybe we have lost our focus.

42
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,070
再聚到一起进行头脑风暴也不是件坏事
It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.

43
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,630
哦 我们可以来一次静思
Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.

44
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,080
我们独特的科学静思
Like our own science retreat.

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,330
我表哥在森林里有个小木屋
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.

46
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,710
我可不去森林里的小木屋
I'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,880
你没看过"林中小屋"吗?
Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,880
{\an8}林中小屋: 惊悚恐怖电影

49
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,220
那我们就去酒店
Then we'll go to a hotel.

50
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,420
酒店? 没看过"闪灵"吗?
A hotel? Did you see The Shining?

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,420
{\an8}闪灵: 惊悚恐怖电影

52
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,260
我们可以北上
We could go up

53
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,590
去大熊湖的湖畔小屋
to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.

54
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,180
你没看过"湖边小屋"?
Did you see The Lake House?

"湖边小屋"里又没发生什么坏事
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

57
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,820
对他们是没坏事 对我有
Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me.

58
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,020
什么穿越时空的信箱
Time traveling mailbox.

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,270
对我来说穿越的
The only time that traveled

60
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,940
就只是我浪费的那一个半小时
was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.

61
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,740
好吧 那我们就留在这里好了
Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.

62
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,410
你还没提议海边小屋呢
Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.

63
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,860
你想去海边小屋?
You would go to a beach house?

64
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,980
天啊 当然不想... 没看过"大白鲨"吗?
Well, good Lord, no... have you seen Jaws?

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,200
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

66
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,540
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *

77
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,260
我和兄弟们讨论
So, the guys and I are talking

78
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,700
想要在这个周末做个科学静思
about having kind of a science retreat this weekend.

79
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,980
只是想问问你可以吗
I just wanted to know if that's okay.

80
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,380
我们本来说好星期天一起吃早午餐的...
You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday...

81
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,720
周末想去拉斯维加斯吗?
Want to go to Vegas this weekend?

82
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,890
当然想去
Of course I do.

83
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,140
Bernadette呢?
Bernadette?

84
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,390
女生周末去维加斯 一起吗?
Girl's weekend. Vegas. You in?

85
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,020
当然啦! 一起去!
Hell, yeah! Yes!

86
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,140
- 我来查机票  - 我来查酒店
- I'll check flights.  - I'll check hotels.

87
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,390
我来查内裤 我可能兴奋到尿裤子了
I'll check my underpants. I'm so excited, I think I peed.

88
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,320
她们好像不反对
They seem okay with it.

89
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,330
嘿
Hey.

90
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,160
- 嘿  - 嘿 我还以为你来不了呢
- Hey.  - Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,630
- 为什么?  - 因为你现在
- Why not?  - Well, 'cause you have

92
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,130
有了固定女朋友 所以我们觉得
a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed

93
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,340
你得待在家里 陪她做点饭后运动
you'd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.

94
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,180
那我得告诉你 Emily今晚要干活
For your information, Emily is working tonight.

95
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,310
是啊 要结束"运动"也是蛮拼的呢
Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.

96
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,180
好了 集中注意力
Okay, let's focus.

97
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,070
姑娘们走了 我们有48个小时
The girls are gone, we have 48 hours.

98
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,440
没人能让我们分神 一起改变世界吧
There are no distractions. Let's change the world.

99
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,020
思考状态启动 我们开始
Thinking caps on. Here we go.

100
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,520
哦 太兴奋了 我们在创新
Ooh, this is exciting. We're innovating.

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,440
感觉就像在演"脸书"电影
I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

102
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,140
我没看过
Oh. I never saw that.

103
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,950
- 不是吧?  - 哦
- Yeah. Really?  - Oh.

104
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,030
很好看的 而且我发誓不是因为贾斯汀·汀布莱克
It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that

105
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,030
参演了才这么说的
because Justin Timberlake is in it.

106
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,140
我有蓝光盘
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

107
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,540
我们应该看看
We should watch it.

108
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,590
好 我做点爆米花
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

109
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,960
各位...
Guys...

110
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,460
过了30秒 我们就从
in 30 seconds, we went from

111
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,550
"一起改变世界吧"变成"一起看电影吧"了
"Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."

112
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,370
抱歉 你是不同意吗?
I'm sorry. Is that a "no"?

113
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,680
好吧 不
Okay. No.

114
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,940
Leonard说得对 我们得集中精力
Leonard's right. We're here to focus.

115
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,970
我们以前不是有点子清单吗?
Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?

116
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,720
我想... 我还留着
I... I think I still have it.

117
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,390
我还没听到明确答复
I did not get a clear answer.

118
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,360
就暂时先放一边了
I'm gonna set this down now.

119
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,110
找到了
Ah, here it is.

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,780
哇哦
Whoa.

121
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,620
我好多年都没看过了
I haven't looked at these in years.

122
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,230
"机器人女友"
"Robot girlfriend."

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,570
是我的主意
Mm, that was mine.

124
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,910
"机器人妓女"
"Robot prostitute."

125
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,460
还是我的
Also mine.

126
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,740
等等 我有点奇怪
Wait. I'm confused.

127
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,610
你为什么会想要机器人女友
Why would you need both a robot girlfriend

128
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,250
又要机器人妓女呢?
and a robot prostitute?

129
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,880
因为有些事情你没法
There's just some things you don't do

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,380
跟机器人女友做
with your robot girlfriend.

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,420
兄弟 你遇到Bernadette之后
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

132
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,010
机器人研究领域受到了重创啊
the field of robotics really took a hit.

133
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,340
好吧 我们就跳过
Okay, let's just skip

134
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,760
那些能"搞"的发明
all the inventions you can have sex with.

135
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,900
好吧... 有了:
All right, no... here we go:

136
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,740
"符合人体工程学的加热坐垫"
"Ergonomic heated seat cushion""

137
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,110
那个会震动 下一个
No, it vibrates. Keep going.

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,750
好吧 我们还是想些新点子吧
You know, let's just come up with something new.

139
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,080
要知道
You know,

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,280
相当一部分的伟大创新都是从科幻作品里
a number of significant innovations have been inspired

141
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,780
找到的灵感
by science fiction.

142
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,540
地球同步人造卫星是借鉴了Arthur C. Clarke的作品
The... the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke.

143
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,540
{\an8}Arthur C. Clarke: 英国科幻作家

144
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,620
摩托罗拉翻盖手机... 借鉴了"星际迷航"
The Motorola flip phone... that came from Star Trek.

145
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,960
我已经怀疑了很久
Yeah, and I've long suspected that the idea

146
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,040
一个非洲裔美国人当总统这主意
of an African-American President was stolen

147
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,630
是从"天地大冲撞"里偷来的
from the movie Deep Impact.

148
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,470
嘿
Hey,

149
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,940
他们在"回到未来II"里演的未来
the future they show in Back to the Future II

150
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,690
就是明年
is only a year away.

151
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,190
那电影里面有好多东西还没发明出来呢
A lot of the things in that movie haven't been invented yet.

152
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,390
如果我们能把其中一个
How cool would that be

153
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,030
在现实中制造出来有多棒呀?
if we could make one of those a reality?

154
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,010
如果我们能弄明白Marty悬浮滑板的
If we could figure out the scientific basis

155
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,310
科学理论依据
for Marty's hover board,

156
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,730
就能在全世界投入应用了
that would have universal application.

157
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,950
这东西... 只适用于绝对零度
Well, it's... it's possible at absolute zero,

158
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,120
但我们得想办法解决
but we would have to remove

159
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,820
温度的限制
the temperature restrictions.

160
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,070
我有个主意
Oh, I have an idea.

161
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,390
我觉得我也想到了
I think I have the same one.

162
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,320
我们得看一遍"回到未来II"!
We got to watch Back to the Future II!

163
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,380
我去做爆米花
I'll make the popcorn.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
我们先去哪里?
So, where should we go first?

165
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,720
哦
Ooh.

166
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,340
酒吧有翻唱乐队表演
There's a cover band in the lounge.

167
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,550
- 不去  - 但他们唱的是巴瑞·曼尼洛的歌
- Nah.  - But they play Barry Manilow.

168
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,170
- 不去  - 但他们叫"酷似曼尼洛"
- No.  - But they're called "Fairly Manilow""

169
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,680
好吧
Oh. Okay.

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,010
- 太好了!  - 不去!
- Great!  - No!

171
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,100
那你想干什么?
Well, what do you want to do?

172
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,480
我们在维加斯
Well, we're in Vegas.

173
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,850
我想去楼下 来一大杯玛格丽特鸡尾酒
I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas,

174
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,020
跳舞跳到吐在轮盘赌桌上
dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel

175
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,360
然后看它飞溅四方
and watch it go everywhere.

176
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,360
如果我们不想吐呢?
What if we don't want to vomit?

177
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,130
你会吐的 所以他们才卖一大杯
Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket.

178
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
- 糟糕  - 怎么了?
- Uh-oh.  - What?

179
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,620
我老板来短信
It's my boss.

180
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
他们把我的现场实习提前到了周一
They moved my field ride up to Monday.

181
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,840
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

182
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,920
就意味着我没有一个星期可以看材料了
It means instead of having a week to study,

183
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,170
只有两天
I only have two days.

184
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,370
太糟糕了
That sucks.

185
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,930
你能早上再看吗?
Can you start in the morning?

186
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,090
有很多东西要看
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

187
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,710
好吧 我今晚看一些
You know, let me do a little tonight,

188
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,350
晚点再和你们一起玩
and I'll catch up with you guys later.

189
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,550
- 你确定吗?  - 没关系的 你们去吧
- You sure?  - Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

190
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,550
现在Penny不去了...
So, um, now that Penny's not coming...

191
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,600
- 我们不去看"酷似曼尼洛"  - 好吧
- We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.  - Okay.

192
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,180
等等 暂停
Hold on. Pause.

193
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,220
有地方不对劲 听着...
Something doesn't make sense. Look...

194
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,550
2015年 Biff偷了运动年鉴
In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac

195
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
然后拿了时光机器
and takes the time machine

196
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,440
回到1955年 就为了把年鉴给年轻的自己
back to 1955, to give it to his younger self.

197
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,610
但一旦他这么做了 他就改变了未来
But as soon as he does that, he changes the future,

198
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,950
所以他回到的那个2015年
so the 2015 he returns to would be

199
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,040
就是个不一样的2015年 而不是Marty和博士在的2015年了
a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

200
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,820
这和"热浴盆时光机"完全一样
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again.

201
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,330
如果未来的Biff
If future Biff goes back to 2015

202
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,160
一把年鉴交给年轻Biff就回2015年的话
right after he gives young Biff the almanac,

203
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,300
他就能回到有Marty和博士的那个2015年
he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it.

204
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,590
因为1955年的Biff是到了
Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday

205
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,720
21岁生日的时候才赌了第一次
that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

206
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
等等 等等
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

207
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,590
用"赌了"不对吧?
Is "placed" right?

208
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,590
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

209
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,760
用"赌了"来形容
Is "placed" the right tense

210
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,980
本该在被未来某物影响的过去的未来
for something that would have happened in the future

211
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,980
发生的事情 时态对吗?
of a past that was affected by something from the future?

212
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,940
在未来的过去的未来赌了?
Had will have placed?

213
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,360
干得漂亮
That's my boy.

214
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,530
好吧 1955年的Biff是到了
Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday

215
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,530
21岁生日的时候才在未来的过去的未来赌了第一次
that Biff had will have placed his first bet

216
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,030
赚了百万
and made his millions.

217
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,200
那时候他才改变了时间线
That's when he altered the timeline.

218
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,700
没错 但他没有在过去的未来的过去赌!
Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it!

219
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,370
什么?!
What?!

220
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
和"热浴盆时光机"不同
Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,

221
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,460
这个简直太简单了
this couldn't be more simple.

222
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
当Biff在1955年拿到了年鉴
When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,

223
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,880
他创造的未来就不是
the alternate future he creates isn't the one

224
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,720
Marty和Brown博士会用时光机器
in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine

225
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,050
去的2015年
to travel to 2015.

226
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,050
因此
Therefore,

227
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,560
在新的时间线里
in the new timeline,

228
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,440
Marty和Doc从来没有带过来那个时间机器...
Marty and Doc never brought the time machine...

229
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
等... 等等
W-Wait.

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,030
“带来”?
Is "brought" right?

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,400
Marty和Doc从来没有过已经带来过?
Marty and Doc never had have had brought?

232
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,660
我不知道 你让我这么纠结
I don't know. You did it to me.

233
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,320
哦 那就这么用了
Oh, I'm going with it.

234
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,040
Marty和Doc从来没有过已经把
Marty and Doc never had have had brought

235
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,300
时间机器带到2015年
the time machine to 2015.

236
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,970
那就意味着2015年的BIff也
That means 2015 Biff could also

237
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,920
没有过已经带给1955年的Biff过年鉴
not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

238
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,560
所以 在1955年Biff得到年鉴的时间线
Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac

239
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,140
也同样是
is also the timeline

240
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,980
没有得到年鉴的1955年的Biff所在的时间线
in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac.

241
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,760
并且还不仅仅是“没有得到”
And not just "never gets."

242
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,600
从来没有过 没有不是过 从来没有没有过
Never have, never hasn't, never had have hasn't.

243
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,860
他说得对
He's right.

244
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,880
而且 Biff是哪门子名字?
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

245
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
听起来像开饼干罐头的声音
Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough.

246
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,830
哔夫
Biff.

247
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
喔 那东西配小香肠简直是人间美味
Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.

248
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,620
又来了...
Guys...

249
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,710
你们知道“鸡鸡”这个词
Do you know that the word "wiener"

250
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,040
来自于德语中的
comes from the German name

251
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,330
奥地利首都维也纳 “维也鸡鸡”?
of the Austrian capital Vienna, or "Wien"?

252
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,600
你知不知道奥地利的地图
Do you know if you look at Austria on a map

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
看起来就像是一个鸡鸡?
it actually looks like a wiener?

254
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,630
我们在干嘛啊
Guys, what are we doing?

255
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,850
我... 我们把妹子们都打发走了
W-We sent the girls away

256
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,020
这样我们就能专注一点
so we could focus.

257
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,050
好像没用
I don't think it worked.

258
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
说不定喝完这之后 你会有心情听听曼尼洛的歌
Maybe after this, you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.

259
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
我觉得喝完这个我就挂了
I think after this, I'll be dead.

260
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,750
看看我俩在外面浪
Look at us out,

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,590
Penny却在房间里学习
while Penny's in the room studying.

262
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,890
我很为她骄傲
I'm proud of her.

263
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,090
这是个不错的机会
This is a great opportunity.

264
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,890
看到她那么认真对待这件事 我很高兴
It's nice to see her take it seriously.

265
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,890
的确
It is.

266
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
不说Penny了		
But enough about Penny.

267
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,680
我们聊聊自己吧
Let's talk about us.

268
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,020
我们看起来很不错
We're looking good.

269
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,100
是啊
We are...

270
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,770
不能更棒了
Better than good.

271
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,190
看看你 火辣的不行了
I mean, look at you. Your body's bangin'!

272
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,080
Amy啊!
Amy!

273
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,360
别这样Amy Amy地叫
Don't "Amy" me.

274
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,410
我们总是讨论Penny有多性感
We're always talking about how hot Penny is.

275
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,750
来 来场科学家之间的对话
Come on... scientist to scientist,

276
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,200
强子对撞机(胸)有多大?
how big are those Hadron Colliders?

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,590
你让我好尴尬
You're embarrassing me.

278
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,710
噢 别害羞嘛
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

279
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,130
给你看看我脊椎里的草皮
I'll show you the divot in my spine.

280
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,630
- 什么?  - 不不不 没关系的 那是天生的
- What?  - No, no, it's okay. I was born with it.

281
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,760
如果你在这儿放一个AA电池
If you put a double-A battery in there,

282
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,520
我的腿会自动踢人
it makes my leg kick.

283
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,940
好吧
All right.

284
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,100
哦 这里就好多了 
Oh, this is already better. There are

285
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,470
这儿的干扰要少得多
far fewer distractions in here.

286
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
而且 这里是我们的思维
Plus, this is where our minds

287
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,940
习惯于专心工作的地方
are conditioned to focus on work.

288
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,610
我在考虑着配电板的问题
So, I've been thinking about the hover boards,

289
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,400
也许我们可以利用磁悬浮技术
and maybe there's a way we could use maglev technology.

290
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,070
或者我们可以想出来过度冷却那些材料的方法
Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials,

291
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,650
我们可以利用量子耦合
we could utilize quantum coupling.

292
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,820
不知道有没有人试过
Well, I wonder if anyone's tried that.

293
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,320
上网查查看
Go online and look it up.

294
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,870
喔 我不能反驳他
Oh, I can't argue with him.

295
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,320
屏幕上清楚的显示着
It's right there on the screen.

296
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,800
奥地利确实看起来像鸡鸡
Austria does look like a wiener.

297
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
那还不是最高能的
That's nothing, dude.

298
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,220
去查查佛罗里达州看起来有多"雄起"
Go check out how hung Florida is.

299
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,420
我确信佛罗里达先生走起路来一定搞笑
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.

300
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,760
我们可以回到工作上了吗?
Can we get back to work?

301
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,670
嗯... 他说得对
Yeah... he's right.

302
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,930
噢 我有个想法
Oh, here's a thought.

303
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,400
不如我们用操控制约的方法
What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques

304
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,270
来避免我们偏离话题吧?
to keep us from getting off topic?

305
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,180
比如行为矫正法?
Like behavior modification?

306
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,190
对对对 就是那样
Yeah, exactly.

307
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,520
你知道
Did you know

308
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,910
那些技术实际上是被用来训练鸽子
those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons

309
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,440
打乒乓球的吗?
to play ping-pong?

310
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,490
不可能吧
That cannot be true.

311
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,210
嘿 都到赛点了!
Hey, it was match point.

312
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,920
一些心理学家
Some psychologists

313
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,930
通过惩罚来制约实验对象
perform operant conditioning with punishment.

314
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,260
没准我们能想出个方式
Maybe we can come up with a punishment

315
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,210
来惩罚那些偏移话题的人
for straying off topic.

316
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,020
不让人看谁赢了鸽子乒乓赛就是一种惩罚
Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

317
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,140
每当我们分心的时候
We could snap a rubber band on our wrists

318
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
我们可以在手腕上贴个条
every time we get sidetracked.

319
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,530
唔 不错 在中世纪
Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times,

320
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,690
那些乱走题的是被惩罚带一个叫
idle chatter was punished with a device called

321
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,360
叫毒蛇钩的东西
the scold's bridle.

322
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,950
那是一个
It's an iron cage

323
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,030
刺穿舌头然后锁住整个头的铁笼子
that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.

324
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,070
要是我们有一个就好了
If only we had one.

325
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,370
喔 我来看看亚马逊有没有
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

326
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,050
客房服务!
Housekeeping!

327
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,700
我们收到了一个
We had a complaint

328
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,010
关于有人在派对上大便的投诉!
about somebody pooping on a party in there!

329
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,090
其实是我俩啦!
It was us the whole time!

330
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,230
为什么告诉她? 刚刚都骗到她了
Why'd you tell her? It was working.

331
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,680
真的吗?
Was it working?

332
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,100
是啊
Yeah.

333
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,900
哦 不好意思
Oh, I'm so sorry.

334
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,770
看起来你们玩得很爽啊
You guys look like you're having fun.

335
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,280
我们爽得飞起来了
We're having the best time.

336
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,700
猜猜谁掷骰子赢了100块
Guess who won $100 playing craps.

337
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,280
那是个一块钱
That's a dollar.

338
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,830
那么猜猜谁对酒吧招待慷慨解囊了
Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.

339
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,370
嘿，Penny... 嘿 走吧
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

340
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,620
我们找到了一个有澳大利亚脱衣舞郎的地方
We found a place that has Australian male strippers.

341
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,790
我们想看看
We want to see

342
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,960
他们是不是扭屁股也是反向的
if they twirl their junk in the other direction.

343
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
听上去很棒
That sounds so great.

344
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,940
但我还有些东西要学
But I have a little more studying to do.

345
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,610
学霸的世界我们不懂
Can you believe this nerd?

346
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,620
来吧 你想屌丝地坐在这儿
Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser,

347
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
还是想看我
or do you want to watch me climb

348
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,280
如同一个袋鼠宝宝一般
into an Australian man's G-string

349
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,320
钻进一个澳洲男人的丁字裤里?
like a baby kangaroo?

350
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,960
好吧好吧 姐妹们 我真的很想跟你们出去
All right, guys, look, I would love to go out,

351
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,460
但我必须把这些东西弄完 明白么?
but I've got to get this done, okay?

352
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,670
所以祝你们在酒吧里玩的开心 
So have fun at the club. And if you get

353
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,170
如果遇上麻烦了 找警察
in trouble, find a policeman.

354
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,000
不过如果他开始脱裤子了
And if he's taking off his pants,

355
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,340
他不是一个真正的警察
he is not a real policeman.

356
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,890
好吧 好吧 这东西显然对她很重要
Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her.

357
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,090
让我们帮她一把这样她就能早点解放了
Let's just, we'll help her study so she can get done quicker.

358
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,760
来来来 我来考考你
Here... here, I'm gonna quiz you.

359
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,430
我来考考你
I'm gonna quiz you.

360
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,770
你的笔记在我手上了!
I got your notes!

361
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,100
在我手上!
I got your notes!

362
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,990
我手上! 想拿到它们
I got your notes! If you want these,

363
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,910
就到脱衣舞酒吧来吧!
they're gonna be at the strip club!

364
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,490
你不去追她吗?
Aren't you gonna chase her?

365
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,660
追到衣帽间里?当然
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

366
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,870
那么我们达成共识
Okay, so we agree,

367
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,210
只要有人转移话题
whenever someone takes us off topic

368
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,460
他的手臂就得被拔个精光
they get their arm hair yanked off.

369
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,600
我可不能让那事发生
And I really can't let that happen

370
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,930
不然帮我做眼睫毛的女孩
or the girl who does my eyebrows will think

371
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,350
就会觉得我对她不忠
I've been cheating on her.

372
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,970
那么现在开始 量子耦合的好处是...
All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling...

373
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,390
等等 不 我有问题:
Wait, no, question:

374
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,520
谁来决定某人是否脱离话题了
who decides if someone's gone off topic?

375
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,060
那应该会很明显吧 不然我们就投票决定
I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote.

376
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,730
噢 而且...
Oh, and also...

377
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,310
嗷!
Ow!

378
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,530
我... 我们还没投票呢!
W-We didn't vote!

379
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,650
我们没必要投... 刚刚显然离题了
We didn't have to... that was clearly a tangent.

380
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,320
快点 回到正事上
Now come on. Back to work.

381
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,150
如果我们倾向于量子耦合...
If we're leaning towards quantum coupling...

382
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,370
啊! 干嘛?
Aah! Why?

383
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,040
你说了“量子耦合”
You said "quantum coupling."

384
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,240
那让我想到了"时空怪客" 
That made me think of the show Quantum Leap.

385
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,240
{\an8}(NBC于1989年与1993年间播映的科幻电视影集)

386
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,250
是你偏离了正题
That's a tangent and it's your fault.

387
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,830
太荒谬了 Sheldon 我投票那没有离题
That's ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.

388
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,380
谢谢 现在我欠你一次
Thank you. And now I owe you one.

389
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,420
嗷!
Ow!

390
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,250
都是你害的
That was your fault.

391
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,760
嘿!
Hey!

392
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,890
喔，粘掉了不少毛
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

393
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,340
嗷!
Ow!

394
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,760
于是我得听Jenny抱怨了
And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.

395
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,680
都停下来
Everyone stop.

396
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,020
这真是个蠢主意
This was a stupid idea.

397
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,240
负面奖励毫无作用
Negative reinforcement isn't working.

398
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,100
我觉得你想说的是正效惩罚
I think you mean positive punishment.

399
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,520
负面奖励是指把利好刺激给移除
Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus.

400
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,940
这是个常见错误
It's a common mistake.

401
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,240
负面奖励这种说法真的是不对的吗?
Negative reinforcement is really wrong?

402
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,950
哦 它一直被错误地使用
Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time.

403
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,780
连比尔·默里在拍摄"捉鬼敢死队"
Even Bill Murray makes that mistake

404
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,780
{\an8}(比尔·默里 美国著名演员 "周六夜现场秀"节目创办人)

405
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,700
第一个镜头时都犯了这个错
in the first scene of Ghostbusters.

406
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,420
不可能 比尔·默里不可能错
No way. Not Bill Murray.

快进到棉花糖人那段

不要嘛!
No!

Leonard说的对
Leonard's right.

414
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,140
我们不能快进
We can't just jump ahead.

415
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,770
我们应该把全片看一遍 
We have to watch the whole movie. Look.

416
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,940
我们一直在拖延
We keep procrastinating.

417
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,810
我们看了"回到未来II"
We saw Back to the Future II,

418

鸽子们玩乒乓球
pigeons playing ping-pong,

419

一堆形状像生殖器的国家
a bunch of countries that look like genitals

和一个生殖器像丹麦地图一样的人
and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark!

呃 不好意思点了那个视频
Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

不早了 我们浪费了好多时间
It's late. We've wasted hours.

我们今晚就不能
Can we please find it in ourselves

424
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,740
稍微做点什么吗?
to do any amount of work tonight?

425
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,130
但是我们还没看到他们捉到任何一个鬼
But we didn't see them bust one ghost.

426
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,500
所以你是说大周六晚上的我们应该站在
So y... you're saying we should stand here

我的实验室里
in my lab on a Saturday night

给看完?
on a crappy laptop?

No.

# - Who you gonna call?  - Ghostbusters! #

433
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,990
这倒真还不错嘛
It really does hold up.

434
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,230
看? 是不是比宾馆好玩多了?
See? Isn't this better than a hotel room?

435
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,270
是啊 摇摆起来!
Yep. Shake that thing!

436

Have you ever seen a body so fine?

Oh! Oh! Oh!

哇 外面好晴朗
Wow, it's bright out.

445
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,880
不是吗? 我是不是该把窗帘拉上
Isn't it bright? I should probably close these curtains.

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,380
想多了 拜拜!
Nah. Bye!
