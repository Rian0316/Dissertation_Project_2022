1
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:06,148
晚饭想不想换个花样
You feel like trying something new for dinner?

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:08,698
德墨菜  德州式墨西哥菜
美国的德克萨斯州和墨西哥接壤

3
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:08,428
要不试试印度菜或者德墨菜
Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?

4
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,758
你有没有好奇过  如果人类是从蜥蜴
You ever wonder how humans would be different

5
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:13,868
而不是哺乳动物进化而来  会有啥区别
if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?

6
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:18,138
好吧  你说吧
Okay, let's talk about that.

7
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,168
你也知道  蜥蜴这种冷血动物
As you know, lizards-- cold-blooded animals--

8
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:24,408
缺乏感知温度的能力
lack the ability to sense temperature.

9
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:27,368
但它们确实在低温环境下行动更迟缓
But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold.

10
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:29,978
所以呢  蜥蜴天气预报员会这么说话
So, lizard weathermen would say things like,

11
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:32,728
"带上件毛衣  外面好慢[冷]"
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

12
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,148
我爱死自己的犀利头脑了
I love my mind.

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,788
我们也是
We all do.

14
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:41,228
快说  晚饭吃啥
Now, how about dinner?

15
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:45,438
大多数蜥蜴吃动物性食物  主要是各种昆虫
体型较大的蜥蜴会以其他蜥蜴为食物

16
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:45,438
我猜我们会享受吃昆虫和小蜥蜴的盛宴
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards.

17
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,158
我们也可以扯掉对方的尾巴然后烤着吃
We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them;

18
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:49,788
反正还能再长回来
they'll just grow back.

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,708
史波克先生  《星际迷航》中的大副先生

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,708
我的真人大小的卡纸板史波克先生到了
My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here!

21
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,748
我知道他不喜欢常人情感的瞬间流露
I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion,

22
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,498
可是  好棒哦  好棒哦  好棒哦
but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie, oh, goodie.

23
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:09,968
史波克中校请求拆封
Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.

24
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:11,358
失陪一下
Excuse me.

25
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,168
允许拆封  中校
Permission granted, Commander.

26
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:17,928
这就是为什么越聪明的猴子
Which is why the more intelligent the monkey,

27
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:20,398
就越喜欢扔大便
the more feces they fling.

28
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,158
打断一下  艾米
Excuse me, Amy.

29
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:26,038
佩妮  你今天的晚饭有安排吗
Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?

30
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:27,238
怎么了  你们要去什么好地方吗
Why, you guys going somewhere?

31
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:28,568
不是  就咱俩单独吃
No, I mean just you and me.

32
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:31,818
像约会那样吗
You mean, like a date?

33
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:34,428
不是约会的那种约会
Not like a date, a date.

34
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,098
呃  好吧
Um... o-okay.

35
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:43,188
行啊
Sure.

36
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:47,608
天啊
Oh, no!

37
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,888
这不是我要的史波克
They sent the wrong Spock!

38
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:55,788
电视剧版《星际迷航》史波克的扮演者

39
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:55,788
生生不息  早日去死  扎克瑞・昆图
Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

生活大爆炸  第五季第十三集

49
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,723
太好了
This is so exciting.

50
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,473
要是莱纳德和佩妮复合了
If Leonard and Penny get back together,

51
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,703
我和霍华德就可以跟他们一起四人约会了
Howard and I can go on double dates with them.

52
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,993
你怎么从来不邀请谢尔顿和我参加四人约会呢
How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?

53
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,103
你衣服试得怎么样了  佩妮
How's it going in there, Penny?!

54
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,733
稍等片刻
Just a sec.

55
00:02:38,913 --> 00:02:40,353
是不是太隆重了
Too much?

56
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,213
-确实  -才没有
- Yes. - No.

57
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:48,083
好吧  再等一下
Okay, just hang on.

58
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,493
你受不了她那股天生的骚劲  对吧
You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?

59
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,443
你和莱纳德是什么时候分手的
When did you and Leonard break up?

60
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:57,733
差不多两年前吧
Uh, about two years ago.

61
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,853
你觉得他约你吃饭的原因是什么
Why do you think he asked you out again?

62
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:00,533
不知道
I don't know.

63
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,703
也许是他命不久矣
Maybe he's dying.

64
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,303
那该有多浪漫啊
That would be so romantic.

65
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:06,193
他命长着呢
He's not dying.

66
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:07,453
真可惜
Too bad.

67
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,503
如果是的话  她就可以把莱纳德推到在床
If he were, she could just throw him in bed

68
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:12,793
骑在他身上尽性  直到他心跳停止
and ride him right up until he flatlines.

69
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,733
这件怎么样
How about this?

70
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,473
-还行  -拜托
- Maybe. - Come on.

71
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:24,563
好吧  这件不行
Yeah, okay, no.

72
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,383
你觉得你今晚会和他上床吗
Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?

73
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,443
绝对不会
Absolutely not.

74
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:29,723
我们就是吃个饭
Look, we're just gonna have dinner

75
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,703
然后再看情况吧
and, you know, see how it goes.

76
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:34,373
如果他病入膏肓了  你会和他上床吗
If he were dying, would you sleep with him?

77
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,393
什么
What?!

78
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,973
假设他身患绝症
Assuming he were dying of something

79
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:39,093
而这种病不会通过性行为传播
that couldn't be sexually transmitted.

80
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,383
比如脑袋上的箭伤
You know, like a spear wound to the head.

81
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:45,023
够了  他的命长着呢
Okay, he is not dying.

82
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,103
你怎么知道  你是医生吗
How do you know? Are you a doctor?

83
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:49,873
不过你可以这么幻想嘛
You can make-believe, though.

84
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:52,923
有时候霍华德和我会假装他出现了心律失常
Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up

85
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,033
而我是一个性感的心脏病医生
and I'm a sexy cardiologist.

86
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:59,433
最好玩的部分是  我的护理服务可是不收费的哟
And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network.

87
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,513
算了  我不打算搞得好得多大件事
Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

88
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:05,913
就是吃个晚饭嘛
It's just dinner.

89
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,273
跟死人一起吃
With a dead man.

90
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,573
艾米  别说了
Amy, stop it.

91
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,363
天啊  我好紧张
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

92
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,243
放松啦
Relax.

93
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:16,163
你知道莱纳德一直都很喜欢你
You know Leonard's always been crazy about you.

94
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:17,343
不会有事的
It's gonna be great.

95
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:18,793
我知道  可是我们好不容易才到了
I know, but we've finally gotten to a place

96
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,623
见面聊天都不尴尬的地步
where we can hang out without it being weird.

97
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,683
万一出了什么岔子呢  然后怎么办
And what if something goes wrong? Then what?

98
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,213
我猜只有谢尔顿和我
Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me

99
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,553
去陪霍华德和伯纳黛特一起四人约会了
going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.

100
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,823
是啊  我们好期待
Sure, we'd love that.

101
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,683
快换衣服  我俩可就指望你俩今晚的表现了
Change your clothes; we got a lot riding on this.

102
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,953
我想修条路
I want to build a road,

103
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,453
wood亦指勃起的阴茎

104
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,453
但我需要硬木
but I need wood.

105
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,843
你俩谁有硬木吗
Do either of you fellows have wood?

106
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,973
我不知道你们在笑什么
I don't understand the laughter.

107
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,653
《卡坦岛》的目标
The object of Settlers of Catan

108
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,613
就是修建道路和房屋
is to build roads and settlements.

109
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,133
所以需要硬木
To do so requires wood.

110
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,533
sheep有时用来指代发生性关系的女人

111
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,533
我现在有绵羊  缺硬木
Now, I have sheep; I need wood.

112
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,823
谁能拿硬木换我的绵羊
Who has wood for my sheep?

113
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,323
我这身看着怎么样
Okay, how do I look?

114
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,993
我更想知道  你为什么要这么做
More to the point, why are you doing this?

115
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:20,833
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,373
你忘了佩妮当初怎么对你的吗
Did you forget what Penny did to you?

117
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,533
你花了两年的时间  还玷污了我妹妹
It took you two years and defiling my sister

118
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,543
才把你的愁云惨淡换成嬉皮笑脸
to turn that frown upside down.

119
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:30,713
我没有玷污你妹妹  我们只是交往过
I didn't defile your sister,we had a relationship.

120
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,983
Brown Sugar 多数形容漂亮性感的黑人女性

121
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,983
我以前听你叫她"靓妹黑妞"呢
I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

122
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,193
在我看来  这就是玷污
In my book, that's defilement.

123
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,203
想听听我的意见吗
You want to know my opinion?

124
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,423
天啊  想听得不得了
Oh, boy, do I!

125
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,323
是故意说反话吗
Sarcasm?

126
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,013
不是
No.

127
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,813
那好吧
All right, then.

128
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,333
你之所以对佩妮这种
The reason you're fixated on

129
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,643
秀外痴中的姑娘念念不忘
a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that

130
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,513
是因为她跟你的第一位爱慕对象截然相反
she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment:

131
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:58,763
也就是你害怕的天才母亲
your brilliant yet intimidating mother.

132
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,813
你怎么会有这种想法
Where on earth did you get that from?

133
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:03,393
她的书《越缺爱的小孩越贪心》里写的
It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

134
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,213
那也不代表就是真的
That doesn't make it true.

135
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:10,623
莱纳德  那本书可是非虚构类的
It's called nonfiction for a reason, Leonard.

136
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:12,993
回见
See you later.

137
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,383
如果有人把她那本书拍成电影
If they ever make a movie version of that book,

138
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,093
你们知道该由谁来扮演莱纳德的妈妈吗
you know who should play Leonard's mother?

139
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,663
桑德拉・布洛克  好莱坞著名女影星  演过不少爱情片

140
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,663
桑德拉・布洛克
Sandra Bullock.

141
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:22,013
为什么
Why?

142
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:25,253
因为她每部作品都诠释得很好
Because she's great in everything.

143
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:30,693
我们玩到哪儿了
Now, where were we?

144
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:33,303
对了  你们谁有硬木吗
Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood?

145
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,123
拜托
Oh, come on!

146
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,853
人家只是想要硬木而已
I just want wood.

147
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,053
有必要要搞得这么难[硬]啊
Why are you making it so hard?

148
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,583
有什么词可以形容
So, do they have a name for a first date

149
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,433
跟以前相好过的人第一次约会吗
with someone you used to go out with?

150
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,103
这个问题问得好
Oh, that's a good question.

151
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:56,023
"尴尬"怎么样
How about "awkward"?

152
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,193
-这词挺恰当的  -对吧
- Yeah, that sounds right. - Yeah?

153
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,543
要不我们假装这真的是第一次约会
Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date?

154
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,593
-看看结果怎么样  -好啊
- See how that goes. - Okay.

155
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,853
胖妮  跟我说说你吧
So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

156
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,263
我叫佩妮
It's Penny.

157
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,553
对不起  真尴尬
Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.

158
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:18,773
没事  我想想
Okay, uh, let's see.

159
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:22,053
我来自内布拉斯加  我还很小的时候
I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl,

160
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:25,043
就梦想着能搬到洛杉矶  成为一名电影明星
I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star.

161
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,983
不过上了四年的表演课
Anyway, after four years of acting lessons

162
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:29,183
当了四年服务员之后
and waiting tables,

163
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,043
我出演了一个痔疮广告
I've done a hemorrhoid commercial

164
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:34,023
和一个保龄球球道上面扮演过安妮・弗兰克
and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.

165
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,803
所以梦想真的能实现的
So, you know, dreams do come true.

166
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:39,813
该你了
Your turn.

167
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:41,223
我想想
Uh, let's see.

168
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,573
我是加州理工学院的实验物理学家
Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech,

169
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,743
大部分研究都跟高功率激光有关
most of my research is with high-powered lasers,

170
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,513
我最近刚拿到一大笔政府资助金
and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant

171
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,243
看看能不能用于研究
to see if they can be used to knock out

172
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:53,683
击落来袭的弹道导弹
incoming ballistic missiles.

173
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,073
哇  那能实现吗
Wow. Can they?

174
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:56,643
废话  当然不行
Oh, God, no.

175
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,073
不过看在这么多钱的份上
The money's pretty good.

176
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:06,253
我还用那设备来发射自己的蝙蝠信号[蝙蝠侠中的求救信号]
And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.

177
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,033
蝙蝠信号
Bat-signal?

178
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,753
怎么  你是所谓的宅男吗
What are you, some kind of nerd?

179
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:14,673
不是所谓的宅男  而是宅男之王
Not some kind of nerd, I'm the king of the nerds.

180
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,753
宅男之王是什么意思
What does that mean?

181
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:22,663
意思是谁要是惹恼我了
Uh, it means if anyone displeases me,

182
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:25,083
我就不帮他们装打印机
I don't help them set up their printer.

183
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,123
-你真幽默  -那就好
- You are so funny. - Good.

184
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,653
那我脱衣服的时候  你就想着这个优点好了
Remember that when I take my shirt off.

185
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,543
莱纳德  这样真好
Leonard, this is nice.

186
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,863
我很高兴我们能约会
I'm so glad we did this.

187
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,963
我也是
Me, too.

188
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:40,873
那你意下如何
So what do you think?

189
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,503
我们能复合吗
Are we gonna get back together?

190
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,173
不用这么快吧
Whoa. Not so fast.

191
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:47,023
对不起  我说错什么了吗
I'm sorry, what did I say?

192
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:50,773
莱纳德  你知道我对你的感觉永远不会变
Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.

193
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:51,713
-老天  -怎么了
- Oh, God. - What?

194
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,593
你说了"永远"
You said "always."

195
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:55,303
你对我的感觉永远不会变
You'll always have feelings for me.

196
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:55,923
有问题吗
So?

197
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,703
那听起来更像是在说
So, that sounds more like something you'd say

198
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,913
你不想和某人谈恋爱
if you <i>didn't</i> want a relationship with someone.

199
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:01,913
"我们不会有结果的"
"This isn't working out,"

200
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:03,913
"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
"but I'll always have feelings for you."

201
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:05,793
"对不起  我跟你的好朋友睡了"
"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,"

202
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,683
"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
"but I'll always have feelings for you."

203
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,643
"是这样的  丽莎"
"Here's the thing, Lisa,

204
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:12,793
"我现在喜欢男的了  但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you."

205
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,473
那你会怎么说
How would you say it?

206
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,163
我对你的感觉不会变
I have feelings for you.

207
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,613
-这不是一样嘛  -不一样
- It's the same thing. - No, it's not.

208
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:19,833
加上"永远"只会适得其反
"Always" made it worse.

209
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,283
-你想太多了  -我没有
- You're overthinking this. - No, I'm not.

210
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,003
你有  你永远都是这样
Yes, you are. You always overthink things.

211
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,953
你看吧  一加"永远"就变味了
Th-There you go. "Always" made it worse.

212
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,953
瞧  我们一谈起来  就开始吵架
See, this is where everything goes wrong: when we talk.

213
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:34,763
谈恋爱当然要用"谈"的啦
Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.

214
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,473
我以前还跟一个叫TJ的家伙在一起八个月
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months,

215
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:37,243
我们从来没谈过话
we never talked.

216
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,643
直到现在  我都不知道TJ代表啥
To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.

217
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:42,763
等等  你们要是不谈的话
Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what--

218
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,703
算了  这问题真二
Never mind, stupid question.

219
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,033
我现在有硬木了
And now that I have some wood,

220
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:56,333
我的殖民地要开始"崛起"了
I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.

221
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,273
他肯定是故意这么说的
He's got to be doing this on purpose.

222
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,933
才八点半呢
Ooh, 8:30.

223
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:08,233
你跟佩妮是出去打酱油的吗
You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?

224
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:12,013
某人都三十岁了  还跟妈妈同住一屋
You are 30 years old and you live with your mother.

225
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,123
看来约会不太顺利
I guess it didn't go well.

226
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,683
我们可不知道
We don't know that.

227
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,913
不能确定
Not to a certainty.

228
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,383
我们只知道莱纳德到家了
All we know is that Leonard is home.

229
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:27,513
现在呢
How about now?

230
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,263
证据还是不够
Again, not enough evidence.

231
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,643
我们只知道他被谋杀了
For all we know, he's being murdered.

232
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,903
现在  继续游戏
Now, back to our game.

233
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,973
你不是在"崛起"中吗
You were in the middle of an erection.

234
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,403
对哦  那"玩意儿"就在我手中
Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.

235
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,773
她现在是想怎样
What does she want from me now?

236
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,533
怎么了
What's up?

237
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:11,143
别想太多
Do not overthink this.

238
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,693
-我不懂  -一切尽在不言中
- I don't understand. - Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

239
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:24,223
好吧  但是之前不是...
Okay, but earlier it seemed like...

240
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:24,983
别说话
No talking.

241
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,063
做的时候也不说话吗  因为有时我会想提问耶
Even during? 'Cause sometimes I have questions.

242
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,103
挺不错
Well, that was fun.

243
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:44,263
是啊  除掉我脚抽筋的部分
Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.

244
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,883
但你还是挺住了
You hung in there, though.

245
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,143
牺牲小我  成全大我
There was a lot at stake.

246
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:52,243
你现在想做什么
So what do you want to do now?

247
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,633
我想去拿我的哮喘吸入器
Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler,

248
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,263
但这样就太毁气氛了
but it might ruin the moment.

249
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,893
我还是不明白
Just, just help me out here.

250
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:04,163
为什么糟糕的约会能以滚床单收场
How does a miserable date end in sex?

251
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,553
我也不知道  这太复杂了
I don't know, it's complicated.

252
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,933
我很聪明的
Well, I'm a pretty smart guy,

253
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,093
而且现在血液主要在往大脑流动了
and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply,

254
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:12,363
试试也无妨嘛
so give it a go.

255
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:15,103
好吧  只是...
Okay, it's just,

256
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,713
在餐厅里你说想
at the restaurant when you said

257
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,013
想跟我复合
you wanted us to be together again,

258
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:23,493
感觉太真实太突然了  我吓到了
it got very real very fast and I panicked.

259
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:24,963
为什么
Why?

260
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,953
你在怕什么
What are you afraid of?

261
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,893
要是我们真的和好了
Well, what if we do go out

262
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:31,313
但我又做了什么蠢事  又把你甩了怎么办
and I do something stupid and dump you again?

263
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,973
怎么就不是我甩你呢
What if I dump you?

264
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,953
得了  别闹
Come on, be serious.

265
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:44,343
那不然我们都不把这当成是谈恋爱
Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship?

266
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:46,643
就好比是一款新的软件
It could be more like a new version of software.

267
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,603
佩妮和莱纳德2.0升级版
Penny and Leonard 2.0.

268
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,593
我们可以先内测捉虫
We can test it internally, shake out the bugs,

269
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,903
等我们都觉得稳定了
and if we both feel it's solid,

270
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,063
到时再公之于众
then we'll roll it out to the public.

271
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,733
那我们先不告诉别人我们复合了
So we don't tell people we're back together?

272
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,493
是的
Exactly.

273
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,723
我们假装约会进展不顺利
We pretend like our date went badly.

274
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,563
这已经不用假装了
Well, we don't really have to pretend.

275
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,233
我们让他们以为我们决定只做朋友
And we let them think that we decided to just be friends

276
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,603
那样的话就没问题了
and that everything's cool.

277
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,133
好啊
Okay, great.

278
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:12,863
我刚想起来
Hey, I just remembered.

279
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,283
我还留着你的吸入器
I still got one of your inhalers.

280
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,453
不敢相信你还留着
I can't believe you kept this.

281
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,143
我本来想扔掉  但还是舍不得
Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.

282
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,683
你太贴心了
That is so sweet.

283
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,993
大概再过二十五到三十分钟  你就能知道
In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you

284
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,753
这对我的意义有多"重大"了
how much this means to me.

285
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:46,733
莱纳德
Leonard?

286
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,423
好啊
Yeah, hi, hi.

287
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,403
你好吗
How's it going?

288
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:53,493
没什么不好
Uh, can't complain.

289
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,893
不过还是谢谢
Thanks for asking.

290
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,893
你凌晨三点在外面做什么
Well, what were you doing out at 3:00 in the morning?

291
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:03,493
那你又在做什么
Well, uh, uh... what are you doing up?

292
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,233
我上厕所啊
I was using the bathroom.

293
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,363
我也是
Yeah, well, so was I.

294
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:11,573
真的吗
Really?

295
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,183
我怎么在里面没看到你
I didn't see you in there.

296
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,713
显然我看到你在用了
Obviously... when I saw that you were in ours,

297
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,593
所以我就出去用其它的了
I went and used another one.

298
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:26,743
上哪去用了
Where?

299
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:31,083
马路对面的加油站
The, the gas station across the street.

300
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,083
穿着睡衣去
In your pajamas?

301
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:34,983
是啊
Yes.

302
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,433
还没穿鞋去
Without shoes?

303
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:40,983
是啊
Yes.

304
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,743
大冬天三更半夜去
On a cold winter's night?

305
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,673
是啊
Yes.

306
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,743
不太可能啊
Seems unlikely.

307
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,003
你带你的哮喘吸入器了吗
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

308
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:59,583
是的  我当然带了
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.

309
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,783
那貌似就可信了
Well, then, I guess it's plausible.

310
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,693
-等等  先生  -干嘛
- D-- hang on a second, mister. - What?

311
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:14,553
你用过加油站的厕所后
After you used the facilities at the gas station,

312
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:17,093
-买东西了吗  -什么
- did you make a purchase? - What?

313
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,563
这是国际惯例  你用了零售店的厕所
It's customary, when using the restroom

314
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,043
就要随便买点东西
at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase.

315
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:24,943
你买了吗
Did you?

316
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:26,763
没有
No.

317
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,723
给你两块钱
Here's two dollars.

318
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:35,063
去买点牛肉干
Go buy some beef jerky.

319
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:44,303
我不想吃牛肉干
I don't want beef jerky.

320
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,473
这不是你想不想的问题
It's not about you.

321
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:52,143
这关系到可怜的巴基斯坦移民
It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan

322
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:53,783
在科罗拉多大道的
trying to make his way in America

323
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:55,313
雪佛龙公司上夜班
by working the graveyard shift

324
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,303
就为了在美国混口饭吃
at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

325
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,963
好吧
Fine.

326
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:06,873
还真是越缺爱的小孩越贪心啊
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.

327
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,003
莱纳德马上就来了
Leonard will be here in a moment.

328
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,453
他要重找一个停车位
He's looking for a different parking space.

329
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:14,403
为什么
Why?

330
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,953
我们旁边停着一辆车
We were next to a car

331
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:18,703
上面贴着一张贴纸  写着"聊聊我的孙子们"
with an "Ask me about my grandchildren." bumper sticker,

332
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,073
我担心如果走的时候遇到那辆车的车主
and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out,

333
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:23,173
我就有义务就跟他聊
I'd be obligated to do so.

334
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:28,353
他跟佩妮的约会居然失败了  我好失望
I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny.

335
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,883
我也是
Me, too.

336
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,123
为了不伤害到他们
Out of deference to them,

337
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,823
咱们就别炫耀自家的完美恋情了
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

338
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:37,103
你还真是体贴善良啊
You have a keen insight into the human heart,

339
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,613
艾米・费拉・福勒
Amy Farrah Fowler.

340
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,753
2000年美国总统选举中民主党的正副总统候选人

341
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,753
现在旁边那辆斯巴鲁上贴着一张写着"戈尔/利伯曼"的贴纸
We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.

342
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,503
我觉得他们不会想聊那个  所以我们安全了
Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.

343
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:50,823
你跟佩妮的约会搞砸了
I'm surprised to see you here

344
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,933
你居然还会来这吃饭
after it went so badly with Penny.

345
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,643
我们都是大人了
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.

346
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:56,203
买卖不成仁义在嘛
We can still be friends.

347
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,393
天啊  要是我跟霍华德分手了
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie

348
00:16:58,403 --> 00:16:59,803
估计就做不成朋友了
if we broke up.

349
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:00,653
为什么
Why not?

350
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,983
我是个报复心很重的人
I'm a very vengeful person.

351
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:05,963
真的吗
Really?

352
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,533
而且我还能弄到改造成生化武器的天花
With access to weaponized smallpox.

353
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,993
伙计们  我先给你们上点水
Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water.

354
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:14,613
你们要看菜单吗  还是已经想好要点什么了
You need menus or you know what you want?

355
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:15,553
莱纳德知道自己想要什么
Leonard knows what he wants,

356
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,693
不过看来从你这是捞不着了
but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

357
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:20,183
霍华德
Howard.

358
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:21,933
不  没事  伯纳黛特
No, that's okay, Bernadette.

359
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,233
有些人就是不适合在一起
Sometimes these things just don't work out.

360
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,673
没错  不过没关系
Yeah, it's all good.

361
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:28,563
我们  我们对彼此的感觉永远不会变
We-We'll always have feelings for each other.

362
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,033
还真是不错啊
Oh, that's nice.

363
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:35,833
看吧  她也知道"永远"的含义
See, she knew what "always" meant.

364
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:39,113
你就是得理不饶人是吧
Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?

365
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,283
我只是想证明我的观点而已
I'm just making a point.

366
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:43,523
你不知道该何时放手的观点吗
Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?

367
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:44,663
够了  够了
People, people,

368
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,563
拜托  在你俩开始说一些会后悔的话时
please, before you say something you both regret,

369
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:49,353
我想先点菜
I'd like to place my order.

370
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,303
好的  稍等  谢尔顿
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon.

371
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,693
你知道咱俩为什么不能做情侣吗
You know why we can't be together?

372
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,223
因为对的永远你  错的永远我
Because you always have to be right.

373
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:56,773
才不是呢
Oh, that is not true.

374
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,043
这点我认同莱纳德
I got to go with Leonard on this.

375
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,293
他是我认识的人中犯错最多的
He is wrong more than anyone I know.

376
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,213
我刚想起来现在是我的休息时间
You know what? I just realized I'm on a break.

377
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:04,883
我叫别人过来给你们点单
I'll get someone else.

378
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:09,003
莱纳德  你要保证等我们下一个女招待过来以后
Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over,

379
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,903
你绝不可以一会儿跟她玩复合
you will not start a complicated on-again,

380
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:12,373
一会儿跟她玩翻脸的恋情
off-again relationship with her,

381
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,273
因为我现在非常非常饿
because I am very, very hungry.

382
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,383
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

383
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:34,143
你想解释一下你在餐厅里的时候
Mind explaining to me why you were being

384
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,563
表现得像个混蛋一样吗
such a jerk at the restaurant?

385
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,633
我那是努力装作咱们没有复合
I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other.

386
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,903
-这不是咱俩的计划吗  -不是
- That was the plan, right?  - No,

387
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,313
计划是告诉他们  咱们决定只当朋友
the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends.

388
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:42,483
你整天那么讨人厌
That's a little hard to do

389
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:45,403
弄得我也很难演下去
when you're always being such a tool bag.

390
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,843
我用不着站在这听你数落
You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap.

391
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:50,433
你这是去哪呀
The hell do you think you're going?

392
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,553
咱俩现在不就是一吵完架就上床吗
Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?!

393
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,683
好吧  说得没错
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

394
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,303
我们这是干嘛啊
What are we doing?

395
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,603
什么意思
What do you mean?

396
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:11,803
我每次幻想到咱俩在一起的场面  结局总是很糟
Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.

397
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,803
那是因为你总是想得太多
That's because you overthink everything.

398
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,973
<i>莱纳德  你在听我说话吗</i>
<i>Leonard, are you listening to me?</i>

399
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:17,523
什么  我在听啊
What? Yeah.

400
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,453
这简直就是个灾难
This is a disaster.

401
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:20,723
我分明订的是
I distinctly ordered

402
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,643
伦纳德・尼莫伊版的史波克纸模
the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

403
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:25,123
扎克瑞・昆图站在我的床脚
Why would I feel safer

404
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,413
怎么能让我觉得安全呢
with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

405
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:32,753
不知道啊  可是他演《英雄》的时候挺威猛的啊
I don't know, he was pretty badass on <i>Heroes.</i>

406
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,003
也是  那我就给他一次机会吧
You're right, I'll give him a shot.

407
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,673
等一下
Hang on.

408
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,723
佩妮  你今天的晚饭有安排吗
Penny, do you have plans for dinner?

409
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,133
怎么了  你们要去什么好地方吗
Why, you guys going somewhere?

410
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,573
不是  就咱俩单独吃
No, I mean just you and me.

411
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,743
你有认真考虑过才问我的吗
Uh, have you thought this through?

412
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:54,293
对  而且我认为我们必须去
Yes, and I think we should go anyway.

413
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:57,923
不行  我还是做不到
No, can't do it.

414
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,603
抱歉  昆图  你还是滚回去吧
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.

415
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:08,368
如果你跟莱纳德复合了
If you and Leonard get back together,

416
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,988
就终于有人可以跟我和谢尔顿
Sheldon and I will finally have someone

417
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:11,508
出去四人约会了
to go on double dates with.

418
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,288
不能跟我和霍华德出去吗
What about me and Howard?

419
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,798
好吧  我们也可以跟你们四人约会
Fine, we can double with you, too.

420
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,238
太没安全感了
So insecure.

421
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,698
你们俩要去哪吃饭
Where are you guys going to eat?

422
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,508
佩妮
Penny?

423
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:30,888
佩妮  你愿意接受莱纳德作为你的合法丈夫吗
Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?

424
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:39,788
我现在说不愿意
Well, it's a little late for me

425
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,908
有点太迟了  对不对
to start saying no, isn't it?

426
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,148
佩妮
Penny.

427
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,658
抱歉  突然想起来我待会要去一下药店
Sorry, just remembered I've got to stop at the drugstore.
