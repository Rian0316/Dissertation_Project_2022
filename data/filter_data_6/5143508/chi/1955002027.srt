Sheldon Cooper之坠入疯狂...
Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness...

2
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:09,315
第二天
day two.

3
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,850
现在是凌晨2点25分
It's 2:25 a.m.,

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,787
我非常想去尿尿
and I feel the urge to urinate.

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,090
我通常的尿尿时间是早上7点10分
My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m.,

6
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,027
但看看我 现在大半夜醒着
but here I am, in the middle of the night,

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,195
努力保持清醒
struggling to keep my mind sharp

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:26,999
不尿湿睡衣
and my pajamas dry.

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,301
但我对现实的认知
It's only a matter of time

10
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:32,872
开始模糊也是迟早的事
before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.

11
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:36,842
我想我应该趁着还知道马桶是啥 赶紧去尿
I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.

12
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,860
两天前

13
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,160
你什么时候开始会哼歌了?
Since when do you hum songs?

14
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:55,294
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,595
- 你刚才在哼歌  - 你确定?
- You were just humming.  - Are you sure?

16
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,565
有时候我的大脑在运转的时候
Sometimes when my brain really gets moving,

17
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,134
是会发出声音的
it makes noise.

18
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,437
你的大脑想不想计算一下畴壁的
How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,705
表面张力?
of the domain walls?

20
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,437
{\an8}畴壁: 磁矩方向逐渐变化的过渡区域

21
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,007
我来看看
Let's see.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,311
嘿! 我真的哼歌了
Hey! I was humming.

23
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,514
赫奇帕奇学院加一分
One point for Hufflepuff.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,386
这是什么歌?
What song is that?

25
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,222
嗯... 你再哼一下
Well... hum it again.

26
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,926
是海绵宝宝的歌吗?
Is that the SpongeBob song?

27
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:31,097
# 住在大菠萝里 # 不是
# Who lives in a pineapple # Nope.

28
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,498
随便啦 我们可以继续算题吗?
Whatever. Can we just get back to this?

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,866
我觉得我应该知道这是什么歌
I feel like I know what song that is,

30
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,402
但就是想不起来了
but I can't put my finger on it.

31
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,572
# 我的国家属于你 # 不对
# My country, 'tis of thee # No.

32
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,241
只是耳虫现象 你会想起来的
It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.

33
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,241
{\an8}耳虫: 某段音乐在脑中不断重复的现象

34
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:45,044
好吧
Okay.

35
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,083
# R-E-S-P-E-C-T # 不对
# R-E-S-P-E-C-T # No.

36
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,585
我们今晚就得这么过了吗?
Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?

37
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:55,721

42
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,535

你好 我希望你能帮我个忙
Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me.

50
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:31,731
这是哪首歌?
What song is this?

51
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,132
你不知道?
You don't know?

52
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,600
你们还有什么脸自称是
Well, how dare you call yourselves

53
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:37,903
"摇滚名人堂"?
a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

54
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,706
天啊 你就是用那张嘴跟唱
My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits

55
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,009
猫王最著名的歌的?
of Elvis Presley with that mouth?

56
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,478
- 他们根本帮不上忙  - 不科学啊
- Well, they were no help at all.  - Which is crazy,

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,515
摇滚不是应该做客服的吗
since rock and roll is all about good customer service.

58
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,550
好了 你脑子里有首歌挥之不去
Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head.

59
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:52,818
大家都有这经历
It happens to everybody.

60
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,887
我可不是普通人 我过目不忘
Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory.

61
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,089
我应该是可以想起这是什么歌的
I should be able to remember what song this is,

62
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,024
但想不起来了
but I can't.

63
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,892
我出问题了
Something's wrong with me.

64
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:02,962
我跟你说过 只要我们耐心点 他自己总会发现的
I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.

65
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:05,698
哦... 我一直很担心会有这么一天
Oh... I was always afraid this day would come.

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,302
这也许就是我坠入疯狂的第一步
This might be the first step of my descent into madness,

67
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,938
从此以后就慢慢去挑战公共场合的裸露极限了
where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.

68
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:14,740
公共场合裸露?
Public nudity?

69
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,977
他也就顶多打个赤脚
Eh, that just means going barefoot.

70
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,887
- 喂?  - 你好 Dave
- Hello?  - Hi, Dave.

71
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,188
我是Amy
Uh, it's Amy.

72
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,791
- 哦 你好吗?  - 我很好 你呢?
- Oh. How are you?  - I'm fine. How are you?

73
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:34,827
我很好 鉴于我在上次约会时的表现
Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you,

74
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,363
我很惊讶你竟然给我打电话了
given how I acted on our last date.

75
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,397
好吧
Yeah, well,

76
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,832
要知道我们都犯了错误
we both made mistakes, you know.

77
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,802
我吃掉了最后一根面包棒 你滔滔不绝说我前男友的事
I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

78
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:47,006
好像他是伦纳德·尼莫伊 你才是我前男友一样
like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.

79
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:47,006
{\an8}伦纳德·尼莫伊: "星际旅行"著名演员 已过世

80
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,375
那你打电话来有什么事?
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

81
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,310
我在想
Well, I was wondering

82
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:54,046
你愿不愿意再跟我共进晚餐一次
if you'd like to get dinner again sometime.

83
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,681
当然可以
Yes, please.

84
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,551
- 太好了  - 让我先查查
- Great.  - Let me just check

85
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:00,353
我的日程表 他说
my schedule, he said,

86
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,189
还假装他的日程表上面有安排似的
trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.

87
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,491
星期六怎么样?
How 'bout Saturday?

88
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,859
呃...
Uh, hmm...

89
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,361
我来看看 星期五
Let me see. Uh, Friday,

90
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,029
和Jay Z(歌手)去农贸市场
farmers' market with Jay Z.

91
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,032
星期天 和艾尔顿·约翰(歌手)去买钢琴
Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John.

92
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,700
星期六有空
Saturday works.

93
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:20,339
哦 你知道联合国有一个
Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations,

94
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,042
处理外太空事务的外交部吗?
there's a Department for Outer Space Affairs?

95
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,643
真的吗? 为什么?
Really? Why?

96
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,379
他们是为人类接触外星文明
They exist in case we ever make contact

97
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,780
而建立的
with an alien civilization.

98
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:31,317
嗯 这种工作就是 超无聊 超乏味
Mm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring,

99
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,119
超无趣 突然"哦 天啊!
boring, then, "Oh, God!

100
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:36,389
我们的行动章程在哪?!现在咋办" 
Where's the memo with what we do now?!"

101
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,058
哦 这个不错啊
Oh, this is cool.

102
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,427
几星期前 我在Facebook上建了一个
So, a few weeks ago, I set up a fan page

103
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,163
- 我们乐队的粉丝主页并...  - 等等
- on Facebook for our band and...  - Wait a second.

104
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,600
你怎么没经我同意就建主页了?
How could you do that without consulting me?

105
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:48,634
这又没什么大不了
It's not a big deal.

106
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:49,902
建个主页也就差不多五分钟
It just took, like, five minutes to set up.

107
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,504
这不是重点
That's not the point.

108
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:54,340
当初创立月球上的脚印的时候
When we created Footprints on the Moon,

109
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:58,043
我们说好每个决定都一起做的
we agreed that every band decision would be mutual.

110
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,346
现在你自作主张
Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing.

111
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,783
我还是单干吧
You know, maybe I should go solo.

112
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,818
但是有人关注我们的主页了
But someone joined our page.

113
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,787
我们有正式的粉丝了
We have an actual fan.

114
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,688
好吧
All right.

115
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,024
乐队比咱俩要重要 我回归了
This thing's bigger than you and me. Band's back together.

116
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,594
听听他写了什么
So, listen to what he wrote.

117
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,397
嗯 "我看到你们在漫画店的表演了
Uh, "I saw you play at the comic book store.

118
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,732
你们可真酷"
You guys rock."

119
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,034
还有一个像这样高举双手
And then there's a animated smiley face

120
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:24,236
的动态表情...
raising the roof like this...

121
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,740
那天我们确实让很多人都高举双手了
We did raise the roof that night.

122
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,375
- 当然  - 这感觉这么好
- Yeah, we totally did.  - Why do rock stars

123
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,845
摇滚明星们为什么要去嗑药?
do drugs when this feels so great? 

124
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,784
# 我为什么想不起来这首歌? #
# Why can't I recall this song? #

125
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:44,023
# 这已经花费我太多时间了 #
# This is taking far too long. #

126
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,425
# 迫使我把头不停不停不停不停地 #
# The urge to bang my head against the wall #

127
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,595
# 撞上墙的念头十分强烈 #
# Again and again and again and again and again is strong. #

128
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:52,064
- 把耳机戴上吧  - # 不 #
- Put on some headphones.  - # No #

129
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,533
# 他们会让我耳垂出汗 #
# They make my earlobes sweat. #

130
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,869
嗯 亲爱的 要不你歇歇
Uh, sweetie, why don't you take a break

131
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:58,537
然后干些别的事?
and do something else for a while?

132
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,674
我正考虑开始一个项目
There was a project I've been thinking about starting.

133
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,908
哦 不错 是什么?
Okay, great. What is it?

134
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,077
我会给你看的
I'll show you.

135
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,683
亲爱的疯狂的未来Sheldon
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon,

136
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,018
你已经被耳虫逼疯了
you were driven mad by an earworm.

137
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,387
你曾经最信任的权威 你的大脑
Your mind, once your most trusted asset,

138
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,357
已经被鹦鹉和猴子所侵袭了
is now a sack of parrots and monkeys.

139
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,959
所以...
So...

140
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,794
我要告诉你所有你需要知道的事情
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know.

141
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:24,096
嗯 首先 音乐很危险
Uh, first, music is dangerous.

142
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,333
电影浑身是劲试图警告我们 但我们没有听
The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen.

143
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:30,803
哦 等等 # 大家都无拘无... #
Oh, wait. # Everybody cut footloo... #

144
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,304
不是
Nope.

145
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:36,642
我愿意付一千刀看你无拘无束跳舞的样子
I'll pay $1,000 to watch you cut footloose.

146
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,678
这是Penny
This is Penny.

147
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,282
她是你的朋友
She is your friend.

148
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,751
如果她给你吃的 你可以放心接受
If she offers you food, it's safe to take it.

149
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,554
反正你可能已经给了她钱了
You probably paid for it, anyway.

150
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,758
所以 你真的要再和Dave约会一次吗?
So, you're really going out with Dave again?

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,993
为什么不呢?
Why not?

152
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,327
他其实是个很好的人
He's actually a very nice guy.

153
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,196
但整个约会
But he spent an entire date

154
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,532
他都在谈他有多喜欢Sheldon
talking about how much he loves Sheldon.

155
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,667
反正Sheldon也这样
That's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before.

156
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,404
Dave只是他的一个狂热粉丝罢了
Dave's just a big fan of his work.

157
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,173
还有 他说他不会再提这事了
Besides, he said he wouldn't bring it up again.

158
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,409
好吧 那么他准备带你去哪里?
Okay. So where's he taking you?

159
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,479
哦 他要来这里 我来做饭
Oh, he's coming here. I'm actually making dinner.

160
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,548
哦 进展很快啊
Oh. That's a big step.

161
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,882
快吗?
It is?

162
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:19,318
当然 你把他邀请到家里
Yeah. You're inviting him into your home.

163
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,619
这是很亲密的举动
It's intimate.

164
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,556
这可是你的内内们住的地方
It's where your underpants live.

165
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,891
其实 这样挺好
You know what? Good.

166
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,428
我试着和Sheldon复合 但是他拒绝了
I tried to get back together with Sheldon. He shot me down.

167
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,829
Dave喜欢我
Dave likes me.

168
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,966
也许亲密才是我需要的
Maybe intimate is what I need.

169
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,267
你确定吗?
You sure?

170
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,003
你从来没有和男人认真交往过
You've never really been with a man.

171
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:42,241
你真的想从这个两米高的男人开始吗?
Do you really want to start with one that's six-foot-seven?

172
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,343
为何不行?
Why not?

173
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:47,646
就像你不会开巴士去考驾照啊
'Cause it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.

174
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,720
我们应该回复那个粉丝并感谢他
Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.

175
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,188
我们该写什么?
What should we write?

176
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,924
嗯... 嗯...
How 'bout, uh... Oh, how 'bout,

177
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,726
"我们可能是月球上的脚印
"We might be Footprints on the Moon,

178
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,297
但你的赞扬会让我们飞跃月球"
but your kind words sent us over the moon."

179
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,867
你真是一点新意都没有 像个老奶奶一样
Someday you're gonna make an amazing grandma.

180
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,502
那你想写什么?
What do you want to write?

181
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,539
写点坏坏的话 比如...
Something bad-ass, you know, like...

182
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,574
"谢谢你喜欢我们的范儿
"Thanks for digging our vibe.

183
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,343
"只要有你支持我们
"We'll keep rocking

184
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:20,679
我们就会一直摇滚下去"
if you keep rolling."

185
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:22,181
哥们 要是我也穿文胸的话
Dude, if I was wearing a bra,

186
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,984
现在一定脱下来扔到你头上
I'd throw it at your head right now.

187
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,753
我继续摇滚 不过你可别真这么干
I'll keep rocking. You don't do that.

188
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,991
我回复了
Okay. I posted it.

189
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,492
这个人是谁啊
So, who is this guy?

190
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:37,129
我看看 他叫Trent Monaco
Let's see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

191
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,298
- 名字不错  - 是啊
- Cool name.  - Yeah.

192
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,934
今年24岁 说自己是个打碟的
He's 24. He's a deejay.

193
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,136
他自己酿啤酒 
He brews his own beer. He's got

194
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:47,906
还有超赞的纹身 他还有个蛮漂亮的女朋友
awesome tattoos. Dude, he's got a hot girlfriend, too.

195
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:52,111
靠 我都不知道谁是谁的粉丝了
Damn. I don't know if he's our biggest fan or I'm his.

196
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,881
嘿 Trent刚刚给我们的回复点赞了
Hey, Trent just liked our comment.

197
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,050
他太酷了!
He is so cool!

198
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,385
别觉得不爽
No hard feelings,

199
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,987
不过我打算要把假想文胸扔给他了
but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.

200
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,569
哦 天啊 他真的是根本停不下来
Oh, my God, he won't stop.

201
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:21,240
为什么他总能变着花样儿的招人烦?
How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?

202
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:24,643
没人知道 所以他才无人能敌
Nobody knows. That's why he's number one.

203
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,047
你能去跟他谈谈吗?
Can you please go talk to him?

204
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,883
拜托 白天一整天都是我看着他 你也去一次行不行
Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.

205
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,952
一次? 是谁帮他清理头发里的口香糖的?
Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?

206
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:37,656
你想让我夸你吗? 那是你的口香糖啊 
What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.

207
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:40,659
好吧
Fine. 

208
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,794
我爱你
I love you.

209
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,162
谁稀罕?
Who cares?

210
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,900
你来我房间干什么? 我...
What are you doing in my room? I...

211
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:50,769
你住手! 那是我的!
Stop it! That's mine!

212
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,672
你怎么这么有劲?!
Why are you so strong?!

213
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,410
搞定
Problem solved.

214
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,190
对了 他还有个大号
Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.

215
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:24,564
未来的疯Sheldon...
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon...

216
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,566
这是中央空调控制
this is a thermostat.

217
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,803
它可以调节公寓里的温度
It controls the temperature of the apartment.

218
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,540
最适宜的温度是72华氏度
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

219
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,576
要是你觉得冷 就穿一件外套
If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket.

220
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:40,413
干脆穿束身衣吧 因为72度最合适了 而你是真的疯了
A straitjacket, because 72's the best and you're crazy.

221
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:43,449
这里...
Now... this...

222
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,318
是你的位置
is your spot.

223
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,554
你对这个位置有超强的保护欲
You're very protective of it.

224
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,522
要是别人想坐在这里
When anyone else tries to sit here,

225
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,457
你一定要无情地赶走他们
you berate them relentlessly.

226
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,161
听起来这样有点过分 但是不知道为什么 你这么干也挺可爱的
It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable.

227
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,799
人们也喜欢你那些小恶作剧
People are also delighted by your love of pranks.

228
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,436
比如 Leonard完全不知道
For example, Leonard has no idea

229
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,904
我对他的咖啡做了什么
what I did to his coffee.

230
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,175
我并没有"换上Folger's Crystals"
It wasn't "replace it with Folger's crystals,"

231
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:11,211
我只能说这么多了
I'll tell you that much.

232
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,847
嘿 你能过来工作吗?
Hey, can we please get back to work?

233
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:15,548
这是Leonard
This is Leonard.

234
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,383
他是你最好的朋友
He's your best friend in the world.

235
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,786
够了 停下吧 这太荒唐了
All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.

236
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,857
有时候他脾气不太好
Sometimes he gets cranky,

237
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:26,693
不过你可以完全信任他
but you can trust him with your life.

238
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,063
他为你做过的事情 数都数不清
And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.

239
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,266
谢了
Thank you.

240
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,501
哦! 他喝了咖啡!
Oh, no, he's drinking it.

241
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,940
你看 你看
Look at this.

242
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,776
Trent在修一个复古摩托车
Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.

243
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,512
太酷了
Hmm. That is so cool!

244
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,481
已经坏了的旧东西总是
Old broken things are so much better

245
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,584
比新的好用的东西更值钱
than new things that work.

246
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,052
谁是Trent?
Who's Trent?

247
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,287
哦 他是我们的粉丝
Oh, he's our fan.

248
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,389
- 什么粉丝?  - 呃...
- Fan of what?  - Uh...

249
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,893
你忘了吗? 我们有个乐队的
Did you forget? We're in a band.

250
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,629
就是只在漫画店演出过一次的那个乐队?
You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?

251
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:06,566
我们还去儿童医院演出过 不过后来被赶出来了
And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.

252
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,034
嘿
Hey,

253
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:11,070
Trent刚才在Fair Oak那家咖啡馆签到了
dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

254
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:14,040
真的? 你想不想去那里见见他?
Really? You want to go down there and meet him?

255
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,309
你们在跟踪他? 这太奇葩了吧
Are you stalking him? That's creepy.

256
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,677
这才不奇葩
It's not creepy.

257
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,013
我给"月亮上的脚印"建了一个粉丝主页 Trent加入了
I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.

258
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,048
后来 我就是看了看他的资料
After that, all I did was check out his profile,

259
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,549
翻了翻他以前发过的东西
go back in the archive of his feed

260
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:24,984
就找到了他推特的链接
until I found his Twitter handle.

261
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,253
然后就很容易在Instagram和Snapchat上找到他了啊
From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat

262
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:28,788
基本上可以追踪他的每一个行动
and pretty much track his every movement.

263
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,858
要是你觉得这样很奇葩 那你可就嫁错人了
So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.

264
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:34,694
可能我应该嫁给Trent
Maybe I should marry Trent.

265
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:37,897
是啊 她还觉得Trent能看上她呢
Yeah, like she could get Trent.

266
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,101
很美味
This is delicious.

267
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,336
谢谢
Thank you.

268
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,939
我很久没吃过家常便餐了
Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.

269
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:48,141
以前你已婚的时候 你妻子煮菜吗?
When you were married, did your wife cook?

270
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,809
一开始不煮
Not at first, no.

271
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,412
但当她出轨了法国主厨以后
But when she began cheating on me with a French chef,

272
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,714
她变成了厨房奇才
she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.

273
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,282
不幸中的万幸
So, a little silver lining.

274
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,650
我想是的
I suppose.

275
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,653
是啊 没有什么比一碗美味的洋葱汤
Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life

276
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,157
更能让人从破碎的生活中脱离出来
like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup.

277
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,793
你在这里 住了多久了?
How long have you, uh, lived here?

278
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,795
差不多五年了
About five years.

279
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,097
我在考虑搬到更好的地方去
I'm actually thinking of moving to a better place

280
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,466
现在我不再需要靠近...
now that I don't need to be so close to...

281
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,968
你知道的是谁
Well, you know.

282
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,869
我知道 那位杰出的物理学家
I do. The brilliant physicist

283
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:20,139
我知道他就住在这一片 不是我在意这些
that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.

284
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,775
是的 总之 他不会开车
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

285
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:25,278
所以我几乎必须 开车带他去任何地方
so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.

286
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,046
必须还是可以?
Had to or got to?

287
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,214
抱歉
Sorry.

288
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,717
我的错 是我惯出来的
My fault. I brought him up. Yeah.

289
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,051
我们换个话题
Well, let's change the subject.

290
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:34,020
不要再提那个人
No more mentions of you-know-who.

291
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,755
那个火车好酷
That's a cool train.

292
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:37,924
你从哪里得来的?
Where did you get that?

293
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,928
# 梆 梆 梆...梆 梆梆梆 #
# Bah, bah, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. #

294
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,673
这个歌
This song

295
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,874
停不下来了
is never going to stop.

296
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,409
你们有处理过
Have you ever dealt with something

297
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,012
这么持续烦人的东西吗?
so relentlessly irritating?

298
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,449
这是逗我呢 对吧?
That's a trick question, right?

299
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,984
我不应该感到意外的
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

对于每个有心理问题的牛顿

306
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,363
都有一个仅仅只是混蛋的爱迪生
there's an Edison who was just a jerk.

307
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,766
你完全可以是这种
That could totally be you.

308
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:23,636
恩培多克勒(哲学家)觉得自己是神然后跳进了火山

309

313
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,515
可能只是因为他口袋里放了面包
Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.

314
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,785
这个名单延伸到科学界之外
The list extends outside of science.

# 但是亲爱的 我会找到方法... #

324
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,480
我不需要让一只鸽子成为我的恋人了!
I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride!

我们错失了让他生活在屋顶上的机会
There goes our shot at him living on the roof.

326
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:18,458
他就在那里

327
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,461
我们应该去自我介绍吗?
So, should we introduce ourselves?

328
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,030
不! 让他发现我们
No! Let him spot us.

329
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,565
我想知道
I wonder

330
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,034
他现在是不是正在听我们的音乐
if he's listening to our music right now.

331
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,335
你可以想象吗?
Could you imagine?

332
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:31,270
那样我们的见面该有多酷啊
What a cool way for us to meet.

他在听着我们的歌 然后抬起头 我们就在这里...
He's playing our song and looks up, and there we are...

336
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:43,583
"你们是月球上的脚印...?"
"Aren't you the guys from Footprints on the Moo...?"

337
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,451
哦 他在干什么?!
Ooh, what is he doing?!

338
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,089
我看不下去了
I can't watch.

339
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,691
没 没关系
I... It's okay.

340
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,559
没关系 他弄好了
Oh, it's okay. He's done.

341
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,761
他为什么看着它?!
Why is he looking at it?!

342
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,199
不会 他不会吃掉它的 会吗?
Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?

343
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,834
加油 Trent 你不是这样的人
Come on, Trent, you're better than...

不是? 从来没听过!
Nope! Never heard of 'em!

347
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:19,385
# ...知道如果语言可以表达 #
# ...Know if words could say #

348
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,820
# 但是亲爱的 我会找到方法... #
# But darlin', I'll find a way... #

349
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,722
我想知道为什么这首歌
I wonder why it was this particular song

350
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,257
会一直停留在脑中
that was stuck in my head.

351
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,958
我不知道 挺洗脑的
I don't know. It's pretty catchy.

352
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,560
你真有喜欢海滩小子吗?
Do you even like the Beach Boys?

353
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,529
他们的名字里就有"海滩"俩字儿呢
They have "beach" right in the name.

354
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,898
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

355
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,233
既然你现在又能认真工作了，要不然
Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say

356
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,169
我们再来看看磁壁的表面张力问题吧?
we get back to surface tension of domain walls?

357
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,838
没问题 我已经想到了更有效的方法
Of course. I'm already seeing a more efficient way

358
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,174
来驯服紫外...

359
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:43,609
我知道为什么脑子里不停响这首歌了
I know why the song was in my head.

360
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,179
- 为什么?  - 歌是关于Amy的
- Why?  - It's about Amy.

361
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,548
好吧 我知道Amy像个老妈妈
Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady,

362
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,716
可她也不至于老到
but she's not old enough to have a song

363
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,818
有首60年代的歌是写她的
from the '60s written about her.

364
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,854
歌里写了她如何让我的人生更美好
It's about how she made my life better.

365
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,222
来看看歌词

00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,860
"彼时无爱 此刻深情

368
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:02,061
"造就了
"More soul than

369
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,062
一个无比丰富灵魂
"I ever had.

370
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,631
"我爱你 温柔了我的岁月"
I love the way you soften my life."

371
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,568
她的确温柔了你的岁月 不是吗?
Well, she did soften your life, didn't she?

372
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,936
就是呀!
Yes!

373
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,505
她就像我心灵的干燥巾!

00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,246
噢
Aw.

377
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,882
我是你心灵的干燥巾吗?
Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?

378
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,553
比那还好 你是我爱情的过滤网
Better. You're the lint trap of my love.

379
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,553
{\an8}过滤网:洗衣机下水管前面的过滤网

380
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,555
噢
Aw.

381
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,732

上面印的是亚弗加厥常数

计算物质原子量的时候蛮有用的
It's useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance,

385
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,475
不过问的人就会觉得无聊了

386
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,977
呃 我...
Oh, I...

389
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,416
以前没人喜欢这个领带夹
No one's ever liked the tie clip before,

390
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,253
然后我就失态了 我...
so I just lost all control. I...

391
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,855
没... 没事的 我们正约会呢

呃 和我一起没必要紧张

我只是国外来的人畜无害的大个子
I'm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.

395
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,636
你看 我只是在犯傻 我...
You know, I'm just being silly. I...

396
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,372
我不知道我期待的是什么
I don't know what I'm waiting for.

397
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:22,942

终于 我意识到这首歌是关于你的
Eventually, I realized the song was about you,

406
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:51,237

411
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,886

我愿意跟你探讨下物理
I'd, uh, love-love to discuss physics,

437
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,383
