1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,530
在我漫长的生命当中
ELlJAH: Over the course
of my long life...

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,404
我逐渐相信
我们的命运与血亲相连
...I have come to believe that we are bound
forever to those with whom we share blood.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,409
我们虽无法选择家人
And while we may not choose our family...

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,941
这份血缘却是我们最强大的力量
...that bond can be
our greatest strength...

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,714
抑或是最深切的遗憾
...or our deepest regret.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,011
从我有记忆以来
就一直陷于这不幸的循环中
This unfortunate truth has haunted me
for as long as I can recall.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,290
（三百年前 密西西比河）

8
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,816
你怎么看？
What do you make of that?

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,190
没有标志，没有旗帜
No banner, no flag.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,154
凭空出现
Floated in out of nowhere.

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,960
谜之船
A miracle ship.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,294
为什么会一直停在那里？
Why is it just sitting out there?

13
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,000
不如我们去看看吧
I suppose we ought to find out.

14
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,183
人都去哪了？
Where in hell is everyone?

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,217
一艘废弃的船
Deserted.

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,590
所以船上的东西见者有份
Which makes everything
in the hold legally forfeit.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,057
大家自己拿吧
Take what suits you.

18
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,764
这个你又怎么看？
What do you make that?

19
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,095
打开它
Open it up.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,845
什么鬼东西？
What the hell?

21
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,927
你好
REBEKAH: Hello.

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,570
长途旅行之后见到这么一张帅脸
Lovely to see
such a handsome face

23
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,072
真是开心
after a long journey.

24
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,505
我能吃他吗，哥哥？
Can I eat him, brother?

25
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,472
我建议你别这么做
ELlJAH: I'd rather you didn't.

26
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,473
不用害怕
There's no need to be afraid.

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,880
照我说的做
You'll do exactly as I say.

28
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,117
你不会记得这一切
You'll remember nothing.

29
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,822
我不会记得这一切
I will remember nothing.

30
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,554
我们航行了好久
We have had a very
long journey,

31
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,819
途中，我们很不幸地
wherein which,
unfortunately,

32
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:09,984
失去了全部船员
we lost all of our crew.

33
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,358
因此，我们请求你帮个忙
Therefore, I would ask you
to kindly transport

34
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,056
把我们的东西运到岸上去
our belongings
to the shore.

35
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,525
你们究竟是什么怪物？
What kind
of hell demons are you?

36
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,034
我们是吸血鬼，亲爱的
REBEKAH: We're vampires, darling.

37
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,133
吸血鬼真祖
The Original vampires.

38
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,441
蕾贝卡，以利亚
Rebekah, Elijah.

39
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,411
我们的兄弟柯尔跟芬恩
愿他们安息
Our brothers, Kol and Finn,
may they rest in peace.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,939
是要让我压轴出场吗？
KLAUS: Are we saving
the best for last?

41
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,111
我们同母异父的兄弟尼克劳斯
And our half-brother Niklaus.

42
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,881
别理他，他就是个野兽
Ignore him.
He's a beast.

43
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,860
从欧洲逃离，幸免于海难
We fled Europe and
survived the seas.

44
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,758
你愿意我一踏上新家园的岸边
Would you rather
I arrive hungry

45
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,523
就饥肠辘辘吗？
on the shores
of our new homeland?

46
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,696
尼克劳斯，你的行为总是这么
无与伦比
Niklaus, your manners are,
as always, without equal.

47
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,605
先生，劳烦你告诉我们
Sir, would you be so
good as to tell us

48
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,502
这里是哪里呢？
where it is that
we have landed?

49
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,240
法国殖民地路易斯安那州
The French colony
of Louisiana.

50
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,403
上岸之后的城市叫纽奥良
Off the shores of a town
they've named New Orleans.

51
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,509
非常感谢
Well, thank you so much.

52
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,446
我建议你为自己
Oh, I do recommend
that you find yourself

53
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,247
找个帮手拿行李
further assistance
for the luggage.

54
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,321
奉上我真诚的歉意
My sincere apologies.

55
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:33,104

57
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,487
什么风把你吹来快活之都？
主演：约瑟夫摩根
CAMl: So, what brings you
to the Big Easy?

58
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,455
我以前在这住过
I used to live here.

59
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,191
真的吗？什么时候？
Really? When?

60
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,120
感觉像是一百年之前了
Oh, feels like
a hundred years ago.

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,763
我刚一个人搬到这里
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
I just moved here myself.

62
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,787
你为什么回来？
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
What brought you back?

63
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,331
我的弟弟在这里
Well, my brother
is here somewhere.

64
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,025
恐怕他已经给自己惹了一点麻烦
主演：克莱儿荷特
I'm afraid he might have gotten himself
into a bit of a bind.

65
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,234
你这语气似乎司空见惯了
主演：菲比托金
You say that like it's
a common occurrence.

66
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,736
他这人很复杂
Well, he's complicated...

67
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,242
目中无人…
Defiant. 

68
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,404
粗野无礼、还有点喜怒无常
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Ill-mannered.
And a little temperamental.

69
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,408
我们不是同个父亲生的
See, we don't share
the same father.

70
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,676
当然了，我不在意这些
Of course,
that never bothered me,

71
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,979
但我弟弟却对此怨恨不已
but my brother
resents it deeply.

72
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,815
从来没找到归属感
Never felt
like he belonged.

73
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,625
总之，他总是容易惹上麻烦
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
All told, he has
a long history
of getting himself
into trouble.

74
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,124
我猜你总是帮他
And I'm guessing
you have a long history

75
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,319
解决麻烦
of getting him
out of it.

76
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,921
你弟弟惹上什么麻烦了？
What kind of bind
is your brother in?

77
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,589
他觉得这座城市里有人
主演：莉雅派普斯
He believes there are
people in this town

78
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,166
在密谋对付他
that are conspiring
against him.

79
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,168
自恋加妄想症
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
Wow.
Narcissistic and paranoid.

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,573
抱歉
我是个有心理学硕士学位的酒保
Sorry. Bartender with a grad degree
in psychology.

81
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,040
职业病
Total cliche.

82
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,135
听我说，卡蜜儿
Listen, Camille.

83
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,747
其实我来这里
是想找个人问一下
I'm looking for someone
who might shed some light

84
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,246
他正面临的困境
on his current
predicament.

85
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,180
她在这里工作，简安德弗罗
She works here.
Jane-Anne Deveraux.

86
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,842
知道她在哪里吗？
Any idea where
I might find her?

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,319
不知道，但我知道谁有可能知道
No, but I know
someone who might.

88
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,548
欢迎来到纽奥良
Welcome to New Orleans,

爵士乐、什锦饭、爱情，还有诗歌
Jazz and jambalaya,
romance and poetry,

92
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,698
更不用说夜幕之下的骚动了
not to mention things
that go bump in the night.

93
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,404
吸食人血的怪物

off human blood.

复仇心切的亡魂
Vengeful spirits

95
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,211
还有我最喜欢的女巫

请进，体验一下巫术吧
Go in,
browse for a hex.

98
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,412
你要一直跟踪我吗，以利亚？

following me, Elijah...

99
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,984
还是你想谈谈？
...or do you want to talk?

100
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,519
你知道我是谁

老是穿西装的吸血鬼真祖

你们家族在女巫界很出名

famous amongst the witches.

103
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,488
尤其是…

Especially with

104
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,296
你弟弟又回来了
your brother back in town.

105
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,900
尼克劳斯来这里是因为他得知
Well, Niklaus is here
because he learned

106
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,799
有个女巫在密谋对付他
that a witch was
conspiring against him,

107
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,905
一个叫做简安德弗罗的人
someone by the name
of Jane-Anne Deveraux.

108
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,198
如果他要找简安，那他晚了一步
Well, if he's looking for Jane-Anne,
he's a little late.

109
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,976
你是说她已经死了？
Are you telling me she's dead?

110
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,481
跟我来
Come on.

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,617
那就是简安？

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,850
在大庭广众下被杀让所有人看到

来这里的人都是女巫
Only people come 'round here
are the witches.

116
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,591
现在她妹妹来取她的尸体了

她的灵魂无法安息

除非得到妥善的安葬

in the cemetery.

119
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,705
拜托告诉我我弟弟跟这件事无关
Please tell me that my brother
had nothing to do with this.

120
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,501
无关，简安的死是因为施魔法被发现
No. Jane-Anne died because
she got caught doing magic.

121
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,807
什么叫施魔法被发现？
What do you mean,
she got caught doing magic?

122
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,007
你想知道谁杀了简安吗？
You want to know
who killed Jane-Anne?

123
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,311
你马上就会亲眼见到马赛尔的作为了
You're about to get your first glimpse
of Marcel in action.

124
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,544
吸血鬼马赛尔？
The vampire Marcel?

125
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,054
你们家族离开后发生了一些事
马赛尔也变了
Things have changed since your family
left town, and Marcel has changed.

126
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,397
我求求你快藏起来吧
I'm asking you,
stay hidden.

127
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,528
如果让马赛尔发现一名女巫
把真祖引回来
If Marcel finds out that a witch
lured the Originals back into town,

128
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,998
我的族人会遭到屠杀的
my people will be
slaughtered.

129
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,306
瞧瞧，我们发现了什么？
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

130
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,937
我得告诉你，苏菲，这个卫角
I got to tell you, Soph,
this street corner

131
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,909
今晚可不是你们族人的幸运之地
is not proving the luckiest spot
for your family tonight.

132
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,484
不到半小时之前
我们在这给你姊姊
Not half an hour ago,
we had to teach

133
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,914
好好上了一课
your sister
a little lesson.

134
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,843
我们在让她的灵魂安息，马赛尔
We're putting her
to rest, Marcel.

135
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,913
别来打扰我们
Leave us alone.

136
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,590
我可没允许你移动尸体
I never said you
could move the body.

137
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,757
事实上，我是特意把她留在这里的
Matter of fact,
I left her here for a reason.

138
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,629
以做逵
Send a message.

139
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,363
如果任何人想要叛变
If anybody is thinking
of joining some kind of rebellion,

140
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,265
我明确规定过女巫不准在法语区施魔法
my rules state that witches
can't practice magic in the Quarter,

141
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,872
但我仍听到风声说
and yet a little birdie
informed me

142
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,531
简安在偷偷地用魔法
that Jane-Anne
was cooking up

143
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,574
密谋些什么
something magically
delicious.

144
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,174
对了
Oh, yeah,

145
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,440
趁你们都在，我问一下
while I have you,
quick Q and A.

146
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,084
我的老朋友，混合种克劳斯
My old friend,
the hybrid, Klaus,

147
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,981
他突然冒了出来
he just happened to
show up out of the blue.

148
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,884
谁都不找，偏找简安
Asking for, of
all people, Jane-Anne.

149
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,617
有人知道为什么吗？
Any idea why?

150
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,589
我不知道
I don't know.

151
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,221
女巫从不插手吸血鬼的事
Witches don't get involved
in vampire business.

152
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,522
不配合我，你一定会后悔
That would be pretty stupid...

153
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,431
我向你保证
...that's for sure.

154
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,902
忠告你一句
Tell you what.

155
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,397
回你的餐厅去
Go back to the restaurant.

156
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,803
好好煮你那出名的秋葵汤
Cook up some
of that famous gumbo.

157
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,443
伺候好游客吧
Keep those tourists happy.

158
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,707
- 把尸体带走
- 什么？
-Take the body.
-What?!

159
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,379
不，不要，住手，马赛尔
No. Stop. Stop. Marcel!

160
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,312
我先暂时保管你姊姊的尸体
MARCEL: I'm gonna hold on
to your sister's body,

161
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,714
以防你想起来为什么克劳斯会来这里
in case maybe you remember
why Klaus is here.

162
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,445
马赛尔，求求你
SOPHlE: Marcel, please.

163
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,952
她的灵魂会无法安息的
Her body won't be at peace.

164
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,091
那可不关我的事
Not my problem.

165
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,426
你是想告诉我，过了这么多年
You mean to tell me,
after all these years,

166
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,826
- 马赛尔还活得好好的？
- 是的
-Marcel is alive and well?
-Quite.

167
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,694
我们兄弟好像卷进了一场战争
Our brother seems to have
wandered into a war zone,

168
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,300
但我还没能找到他
and I haven't been
able to find him.

169
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,664
马赛尔是克劳斯转变的
并在他的庇护下
Marcel, who Klaus sired
and brought up

170
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,601
茁壮成长
现在成了一群野蛮横行
beneath his own wing,
now rules a menagerie

171
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,900
吸血鬼的首领
of savage vampires
running wild,

172
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,975
在人类活动的地方肆无忌惮地杀戮
killing in public for
any human to come upon.

173
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,702
女巫们被控制了
Witches are held
in subjugation.

174
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,244
我怀疑尼克劳斯一点也不清楚
I doubt Niklaus
had any idea

175
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,813
自己卷入了什么样的麻烦
what he was
walking into.

176
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,040
抱歉，你刚才说什么？
Sorry.
What was that?

177
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,247
我一听到“我们兄弟”就恍神了
I stopped paying attention
at "our brother."

178
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,408
蕾贝卡
Rebekah.

179
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,817
我们那个令人憎恨
背信弃义的混蛋兄弟
Our hateful, traitorous bastard
of a brother,

180
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,251
他多次强调
who's negated
any sympathy

181
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,914
一旦我们离开他
I once had for him
by his repeated efforts

182
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,753
就得不到任何的幸福
to ensure neither you
nor I know happiness

183
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,725
我早就不关心他了
outside of his own
selfish universe.

184
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,453
永远在一起，蕾贝卡
Always and forever, Rebekah.

185
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,462
我们曾对彼此发誓的
That is what we once
swore to each other.

186
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,327
就当我反悔了吧
Consider this me
calling take-backs.

187
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,298
你这几百年也反悔不少次了
Oh, you've called take-backs dozens
of times over the centuries.

188
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,201
但当父亲找到我们
在这座城市追杀我们时
And yet when our father found us
and chased us from this very city…

189
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,899
我虽然很老了，以利亚，但我不糊涂
I may be old, Elijah,
but I'm hardly senile.

190
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,772
我很清楚我跟克劳斯密不可分
I know very well
I stuck with Klaus.

191
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,743
而不是三年之后，他用银匕首
And not three years later
he stuck a silver dagger

192
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,405
插进我胸口，让我一觉睡了90年
in my chest and sent me into
a magical slumber for 90 years.

193
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,573
你知道为什么吗？
Do you know why?

194
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,013
因为我有胆子离开他
Because I had
the audacity to try

195
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,245
过我自己的生活
and live my life
on my own without him.

196
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,390
够了，我觉得他有麻烦了
No. I believe our brother
is in trouble.

197
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,684
不管马赛尔和女巫之间发生了什么
So whatever is going on
between Marcel and the witches,

198
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,053
可怕得足以让她们冒险
it's dire enough that
they'd risk

199
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,660
把吸血鬼真祖引回来
bringing an Original
back to town.

200
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,126
是女巫把他引诱过来的
The witches
have lured him here.

201
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,321
我想知道为什么
I'd like to know why.

202
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,281
是你把我牵扯进这一切的，简
You got me into this, Jane.

203
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,657
给我力量去了结这一切
Give me the strength
to finish it.

204
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,942
门可以用的
The doors work,
you know.

205
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,811
你在施魔法吗？
You're doing magic?

206
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,672
我在对我死去的姊姊祈祷
I'm praying
to my dead sister.

207
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,682
来啊，表达你们的哀悼吧
Go ahead.
Pay your respects.

208
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,278
别给我添麻烦，苏菲
Ah! Don't make this
a thing, Sophie.

209
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,286
那个混合种在找简安
The Hybrid was looking
for Jane-Anne.

210
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,856
马赛尔想知道原因
Marcel wants to know why.

211
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,859
我想说你自己去问她吧，但现在不行了
I'd say ask her yourself,
but I guess you can't,

212
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,553
因为马赛尔杀了她
seeing as Marcel killed her.

213
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,477
我是以利亚
I'm Elijah.

214
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,621
听说过我吗？
Have you
heard of me?

215
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,823
是的
Yes.

216
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:36,984
告诉我你家人
So why don't you tell me

217
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,256
找我弟弟是为什么事
what business your family has
with my brother?

218
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,545
这里是圣地
This is sacred ground,

219
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,581
也就是说吸血鬼需要被邀请才能进入
which means vampires
have to be invited in.

220
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,087
但既然我已经孤注一掷了
进来吧
But since I'm desperate,
come on in.

221
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,386
我们可以在这自由地说话
We can talk freely here.

222
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,890
那你最好快说
Then I suggest
you start talking.

223
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,262
你姊姊想要尼克劳斯怎样？
What did your sister
want with Niklaus?

224
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,090
还不明显吗？
Isn't it obvious?

225
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,566
我们和吸血鬼之间有问题了
我们需要帮助
We have a vampire problem,
and we need help.

226
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,064
马赛尔有一支部队支援他
Marcel has an army
backing him.

227
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,071
女巫们一直想要反击
The witches have been
trying to fight back.

228
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,539
但我们运气不好
We haven't had
much luck

229
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,701
直到我姊姊简安过见了一个女孩
until my sister
Jane-Anne met a girl.

230
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,344
一个路过此地的狼人
Awerewolf passing
through the Quarter

231
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,107
她来自维吉尼亚的某个小镇
from a small town
in Virginia.

232
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,380
她和你弟弟有某种特殊的联系
She had a special
connection to your brother.

233
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,848
什么样的联系？
What kind
of connection?

234
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,150
很显然他们共度了一些时光
Apparently, they spent
some time together.

235
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,623
一切就顺理成章地发生了
One thing led
to another,

236
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,228
现在这个特殊的狼人女孩
and now this special
werewolf girl,

237
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,196
她怀孕了，她腹中孩子的父亲
she's pregnant,
and the father
of the child
she's carrying

238
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,834
就是你弟弟克劳斯
is your brother, Klaus.

239
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,667
不可能
It's impossible.

240
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,535
没什么不可能
Nothing is impossible,

241
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,898
尤其是发生在你弟弟身上的事
especially not when it comes
to your brother.

242
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,672
想一想
Think about it.

243
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,277
大家都叫他混合种，对吧？
They call him
the Hybrid, right?

244
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,180
带她出来
Bring her out.

245
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,630
你是谁？
Who the hell are you?

246
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,266
让我们单独说两句话
Give us a moment, please.

247
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,581
她们把你强行关在这里？
So, have they been holding you here
against your will?

248
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,585
她们把我引到河口，抓住了我
They lured me out to the bayou
and grabbed me.

249
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,880
然后施展了这些古怪的巫术
Then they did all these
weird, witchy tests.

250
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,717
我不明白这怎么可能
Not that I understand
how this could happen.

251
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,691
我是说吸血鬼没有生命
I mean,
vampires are dead.

252
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,591
他们不能生育
They can't have children.

253
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,323
也许如果你了解我弟弟的故事
Perhaps if you knew
my brother's story,

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,058
就能明白这是怎么回事了
it might explain
how this is possible.

255
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,427
请允许我…
Here.
If I may.

256
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,093
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

257
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,568
别紧张
Relax.

258
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,099
如果你对我敞开心扉
If you open
your mind to me...

259
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,072
我会告诉你
...I can show you.

260
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,448
最开始的时候，我们都是人类
In the beginning,
our family was human.

261
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,116
在一千年之前
A thousand years ago now.

262
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,348
快点，亨利，兄弟们又打起来了
Come on, Henry, our brothers
are fighting again.

263
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,853
尽管母亲对黑魔法有所涉猎
ELlJAH: Although our mother
dabbled in the dark arts,

264
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,585
我们充其量只是想要在困难时期
we were largely just a family
trying to survive

265
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,230
试图努力存活下去
at a time when it was quite
difficult to do so.

266
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,462
无论如何
我们过得很开心
And, for better or worse,
we were happy.

267
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,572
然而，直到有天晚上
That is, however,
until one night

268
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,207
我们最小的弟弟被杀了
our youngest brother
was killed

269
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,275
凶手是村子里最大的威胁
by our village's greatest threat.

270
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,905
弟弟
Brother!

271
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,108
这些人可以在月圆之时变身为狼
Men that could transform themselves
into wolves during the full moon.

272
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,778
我们的家人伤心欲绝
Our family was devastated.

273
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,719
尼克劳斯尤甚
None more than Niklaus.

274
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,051
父亲决心要保护我们
Desperate to protect
the rest of us,

275
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,090
于是逼迫母亲
our father forced
our mother to call

276
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,821
使用黑魔法，让我们变强
upon her black magic
in order to make us stronger.

277
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,956
喝下去
Drink!

278
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,263
喝
Drink!

279
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,569
就这样，初代吸血鬼诞生
Thus, the first
vampires were born.

280
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,437
但我们拥有的速度、力量
But with this speed,
this strength,

281
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,407
还有不死之身，让我们异常饥饿
this immortality
came a terrible hunger.

282
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,911
尼克劳斯尤甚
No one felt this hunger
more than Niklaus.

283
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,617
他第一次杀人之后
When he killed for the first time,

284
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,415
看清了自己的本质
we knew what he truly was.

285
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,356
尼克劳斯
Niklaus!

286
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,990
我这是怎么了？
What is happening to me?

287
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,758
不，别过去
别过去
No, don't! Don't!

288
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,268
父亲，好痛啊
Father! It hurts!

289
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,738
他是个野兽，恶心的怪物
He's a beast.
An abomination.

290
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,978
他不只是个吸血鬼
He wasn't just a vampire.

291
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,848
他还是个狼人
He was also a werewolf.

292
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,886
狼人的诅咒就是这样
That's how the werewolf
curse works.

293
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,257
夺人性命之后才会放动
It isn't activated
until you take a life.

294
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,022
尼克劳斯是母亲和别人的私生子
Niklaus was the result
of an indiscretion

295
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,790
她一直瞒着我们
our mother had hidden
from us all.

296
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,567
他的亲生父亲是一个狼人
An affair with
a werewolf like yourself.

297
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,904
父亲对这背叛感到震怒
Infuriated by this betrayal,

298
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,836
要求母亲对克劳斯施咒
my father forced our mother
to cast a spell that would

299
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,909
压制他的狼人面
迫使他放弃
suppress Klaus' werewolf side,
denying him any connection

300
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,443
真正的自我
with his true self.

301
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,212
以利亚，以利亚，压住他
Elijah, Elijah.
Hold him down.

302
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,251
哥哥，别让他们这样对我
Brother!
Please don't let them do this to me.

303
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,788
快点啊，儿子，快
Do it now, boy! Now!

304
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,054
救我
Help me.

305
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,030
你爸爸真混蛋
Your dad was a dick.

306
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,667
顺便说一句，我叫海莉
I'm Hayley,
by the way.

307
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,630
既然你打算把你们的一切向我倾诉
You should probably
know my name

308
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,832
也许你该知道我的名字
if you're gonna tell me
your whole life story.

309
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,609
我知道你的名字
I mean, I know yours.

310
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,575
你的家人真是传奇
Your family is legendary.

311
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,873
你弟弟是恶名昭彰的神经病
Your brother is
a notorious psycho,

312
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,042
我还跟他睡了，真佩服自己
who I slept with.
Classic me.

313
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,521
我不能帮他找藉口
I cannot excuse his behavior,

314
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,816
不过你要明白
but you must understand

315
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,618
几百年来
that our father hunted him,

316
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,522
父亲一直追杀他
追杀我们
hunted us for centuries.

317
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,424
每次我们得到片刻欢愉
Every time we found
a moment of happiness,

318
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,031
就被迫逃亡，即使是在这里，纽奥良
we were forced to flee,
even here in New Orleans,

319
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,894
曾让我们最快乐的地方
where we were happiest of all.

320
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,636
在尼克劳斯破除了
Not long after
Niklaus broke the spell

321
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,034
阻碍他成为混合种的咒语不久之后
which prevented him
from becoming the Hybrid...

322
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,303
他打败了父亲
...he defeated our father.

323
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,538
我以为他会因此快乐
I thought this
would make him happy.

324
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,439
但他比从前更愤怒
He was angrier than ever.

325
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,175
我想，或许这孩子
I wonder if, perhaps,
this baby

326
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,650
可以帮我弟弟找回快乐
might be a way
for my brother to find happiness.

327
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,653
我回他自己
A way to save him from himself.

328
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,725
我很高兴你能那么想
I'm glad you feel that way.

329
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,820
因为我们需要你的帮助
Because we need your help.

330
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,791
你到底要什么？
What, precisely,
is it that you want,

331
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,557
这又跟这女孩有什么关系？
and what does it have to do
with this young woman?

332
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,134
我们要把马赛尔和他的吸血鬼们
赶出这个城市
We want to run Marcel
and his vampires out of town.

333
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,564
克劳斯是关键
Klaus is the key.

334
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,536
马赛尔所知道关于吸血鬼的一切
Everything Marcel knows
about being a vampire,

335
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,140
都是跟克劳斯学的
he learned from Klaus.

336
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,743
马赛尔信任他，仰慕他
Marcel trusts him.
Looks up to him.

337
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,978
他不会预料到他的背叛
He won't see the betrayal coming.

338
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,580
对，我相信你也知道
Yes. Well, as I'm sure
you're aware,

339
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,910
我弟弟尼克劳斯不喜欢被吩咐做事
my brother Niklaus
doesn't like to be told what to do.

340
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,242
所以我才带你来这里
That's why
I brought you here.

341
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,051
马赛尔几十年前把狼人
都赶出了这个城市
Marcel drove the werewolves
out of town decades ago.

342
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,985
你真的以为他会欢迎
Do you really think
he's going to welcome

343
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,754
一个混合种婴儿做邻居吗？
a Hybrid baby
to the neighborhood?

344
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,028
说服克劳斯来帮我们
Convince Klaus to help us

345
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,724
就不会有人知道真祖家族
and no one has to know
about the newest member

346
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,163
添了个新成员
of the Original family.

347
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,529
听着很像是威胁啊
That sounds remarkably
like blackmail.

348
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,872
我说过，这是孤注一掷
Like I said,
I'm desperate.

349
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,304
好吧，那么…
Well, then.

350
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,375
这事非我莫属了，是不是？
I have my work cut out for me,
don't l?

351
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,332
晚安，以利亚
Evening, Elijah.

352
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,629
尼克劳斯
Niklaus.

353
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,931
真没想到你不请自来啊
What an entirely
unwelcome surprise.

354
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,900
你的态度倒是意料之中啊
And what an entirely
unsurprising welcome.

355
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,465
跟我来
Come with me.

356
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,475
我哪都不去
除非查出
I'm not going anywhere
until I find out

357
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,671
是谁在密谋对付我
who's conspiring against me.

358
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,313
我已经帮你查到了
I believe I just
found that out for you.

359
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,778
不，不可能
No. It's impossible.

360
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,115
我也这么说过
I said the same thing myself.

361
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,123
撒谎，你们都在撒谎
This is a lie.
You're all lying.

362
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,988
吸血鬼无法生育
Vampires cannot procreate.

363
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,527
但狼人可以
But werewolves can.

364
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,692
魔法让你成为吸血鬼
Magic made you a vampire...

365
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,922
但你生来就是狼人
...but you were born
a werewolf.

366
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,724
你是混合种真祖
You're the Original Hybrid,

367
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,798
你族类的第一人
the first of your kind,

368
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,563
这次怀孕
是自然的一个疏漏
and this pregnancy
is one of nature's loopholes.

369
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,841
这一定是别人的种，承认吧
You've been with someone else.
Admit it!

370
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,811
嘿，我被困在一个
Hey, I've spent days held captive

371
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,540
恐怖的鳄鱼河口好几天
in a freakin' alligator bayou

372
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,979
因为他们认为我怀着
because they think
that I'm carrying

373
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,346
一个神奇的婴儿
some magical miracle baby.

374
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,010
要不是你的种
Don't you think
I would've 'fessed up

375
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,213
我不会坦白吗？
if it wasn't yours?

376
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,483
我姊姊献出了生命完成咒语
My sister gave her life
to perform the spell

377
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,923
就为了确认怀孕是真的
she needed to confirm
this pregnancy.

378
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,686
因为简安的牺牲
Because of Jane-Anne's sacrifice,

379
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,592
这女孩和她孩子的性命
the lives of this girl and her baby

380
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,027
现在由我们决定
are now controlled by us.

381
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,724
我们可以让他们很安全
We can keep them safe.

382
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,132
也可以杀了他们
Or we can kill them.

383
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,837
如果你不帮我们搞定马赛尔
If you don't help us
take down Marcel,

384
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,543
别怪我，我会让海莉活不到
so help me,
Hayley won't live long enough

385
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,269
可以穿孕妇装
to see her first
maternity dress.

386
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,435
等等，什么？
Wait, what?

387
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,673
够了
如果你想马赛尔死，他会的
Enough of this. If you want
Marcel dead, he's dead.

388
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,282
- 我会亲手干掉他
- 不
-I'll do it myself.
-No.

389
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,178
不行，现在还不行
We can't.
Not yet.

390
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,014
我们必须连循自己的计划
We have a clear plan
that we need to follow,

391
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,621
而且有很多规矩
and there are rules.

392
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,664
你竟敢命令我
How dare you command me.

393
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,464
用你自认为是
Threaten me with what you

394
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,695
我的弱点的东西来恐吓我
wrongfully perceive
to be my weaknesses?

395
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,998
这是个无聊的骗局
This is a pathetic deception.

396
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,766
谎话我听够了
I won't hear any more lies.

397
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,773
尼克劳斯…
ELlJAH: Niklaus.

398
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,610
你听
Listen.

399
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,963
杀掉她和孩子
Kill her, and the baby.

400
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,207
我才不在乎
What do I care?

401
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,671
管他的，我走了
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

402
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,875
谁也不准趣她
No one touches the girl.

403
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,217
我会想办法的
I'll fix this.

404
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,189
尼克劳斯
ELlJAH: Niklaus.

405
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,658
这是个圈套，以利亚
It's a trick, Elijah.

406
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,594
不，弟弟，这是个礼物
No, brother.
It's a gift.

407
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,126
是你的机会，也是我们的
It's your chance.
It's our chance.

408
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,325
什么机会？
To what?

409
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,300
新的开始
拿回我们失去的一切
To start over.
Take back everything we lost,

410
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,064
一切被夺走的东西
everything that was
taken from us.

411
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,770
尼克劳斯，我们的父母鄙视我们
Niklaus, our own parents
came to despise us.

412
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,002
我们的家毁了
Our family was ruined.

413
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,373
我们也毁了
从那以后
We were ruined.
And since then,

414
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,639
你一直想要的
all that you
have ever wanted,

415
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,749
我们一直想要的
all that we
have ever wanted...

416
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,983
就是一个家
...was a family.

417
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,785
我不会受人操纵的
I will not be
manipulated.

418
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,319
她们操纵你，那又怎样？
So they're manipulating you,
so what?

419
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,121
有了她们，这女孩和孩子
With them, this girl
and her child,

420
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,265
你的孩子…
your child...

421
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,763
可以活着
...Iive.

422
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,937
我会把她们全部杀掉
I'm gonna kill
every last one of them.

423
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,331
然后呢？
And then what?

424
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,633
你回到迷瀑镇
Then you return
to Mystic Falls

425
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,002
继续做那个今人憎恨的
to resume your life
as the hated one?

426
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,234
邪恶混合种？
As the evil Hybrid?

427
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,140
让人们畏惧你的名号
Is it so important to you
that people quake with fear

428
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,371
有那么重要吗？
at the sound of your name?

429
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,037
人们畏惧我是因为
People quake with fear
because I have the power

430
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,444
我有那个能力
to make them afraid.

431
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,878
这个孩子能给我什么？
What will this child offer me?

432
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,246
能给我力量吗？
Will it guarantee me power?

433
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,581
家就是力量，尼克劳斯
Family is power, Niklaus.

434
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,054
爱，忠诚，就是力量
Love, loyalty, that's power.

435
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,557
这是我们一千年前对彼此的承诺
This is what we swore to
one another a thousand years ago

436
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,251
在生活夺走你那仅有的人性之前
before life tore away
what little humanity

437
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,296
在自大，愤怒，偏执
you had left.
Before ego, before anger,

438
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,899
塑造了我面前这个人之前
before paranoia created
in this person before me...

439
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,865
我几乎认不出这个人就是我的亲弟弟
...someone I can barely even
recognize as my own brother.

440
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,731
这就是我们
This is us.

441
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,203
真祖家族
The Original Family.

442
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,842
我们会一直永远地在一起
We remain together,
always and forever.

443
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,414
我请求你留下
I am asking you to stay here.

444
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,048
我会帮助你，支援你
I will help you,
and I will stand by you.

445
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,816
尽到兄长的责任
I will be your brother.

446
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,393
我们一起在这里建立一个家园
We will build
a home here together.

447
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,120
救救这个女孩
So, save this girl.

448
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,092
救救你的孩子吧
Save your child.

449
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,977
不要
No.

450
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,684
马赛尔和他的吸血鬼们不受控制
Marcel and his vampires
are out of control.

451
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,052
必须采取一些错施
Something had to be done.

452
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,888
解决方法是引来更多的吸血鬼吗？
And the solution is to
bring in more vampires?

453
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,155
他们不是普通吸血鬼，爱格妮丝
Sophie: These aren't just
any vampires, Agnes.

454
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,696
他们是真祖
They're the Originals.

455
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,596
你凭什么觉得你能控制那个混合种？
What makes you think you
can control the Hybrid?

456
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,400
她不能
ELlJAH: She can't.

457
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,068
我也无法保证我能控制
Not entirely certain
that I can, either.

458
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,507
但现在你们女巫已经把他惹火了
But now that your coven
has drawn his ire,

459
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,942
我有个问题
I have a question.

460
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,839
怎样能让我弟弟不杀掉你
What prevents my brother
from murdering you

461
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,483
而是与你合作呢？
instead of cooperating?

462
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,394
搞什么鬼？
What the hell?

463
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,727
那个导致我姊姊
The spell my sister performed,

464
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,130
失去生命的魔法
the one that got her killed,

465
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,827
并不只是确定怀孕这件事
it didn't just
confirm the pregnancy,

466
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,302
还把我和海莉连结在一起
it linked me to Hayley.

467
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,306
所以我身上发生的任何事
都会发生在她身上
So anything
that happens to me, happens to her.

468
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,968
也就是说她的命在我手上
Which means her life is in my hands.

469
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,681
克劳斯也许不在乎自己的孩子
Klaus may not care
about his own child,

470
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,875
但显然对你来说，孩子意义很大
but it's very clear what
it already means to you.

471
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,747
如果我必须伤害海莉
或者做更糟的事
If I have to hurt Hayley, or worse,

472
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,621
来确保你的注意，我会的
to ensure that I have your attention,
I will.

473
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,957
你竟敢威胁真祖？
You would dare threaten
an Original?

474
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,725
我已经一无所有了
I have nothing to lose.

475
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,093
在午夜之前，你必须让
You have until midnight

476
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,502
克劳斯改变主意
to get Klaus to change his mind.

477
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,442
嘿，兄弟，你去哪了？
Hey, man.
Where'd you run off to?

478
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,916
有人惹你生气了
Someone put you in a mood.

479
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,218
我能做什么？
What can I do?

480
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,486
你能做的是告诉我
What you can do is,
you can tell me what

481
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,391
你和那些女巫是怎么回事
this thing is you have
with the witches.

482
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,557
你知道我所有的一切都是你给的
You know I owe you everything I got.

483
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,531
但恐怕这事我们没得商量
But I'm afraid I have
to draw the line on this one.

484
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,234
这是我的事
This is my business.

485
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,066
我控制我城市的女巫
I control the witches in my town.

486
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,537
就这样吧
Let's just leave it at that.

487
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,569
- 你的城市？
- 一点也没错
-Your town?
-Damn straight.

488
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,580
有意思，一百年前我离开的时候
That's funny because when I left
a hundred years ago,

489
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,740
你还只是个可怜的小混混
you were just a pathetic,
little scrapper.

490
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,818
在那些压迫你的人的鞭打下
Still trembling from the lashes
of the whips

491
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,454
浑身发
of those who would keep you down.

492
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,523
现在再看看你，一方霸主
And now look at you.
Master of your domain.

493
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,853
城市王子
(MUSlC STOPS ABRUPTLY)
Prince of the city.

494
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,863
我想知道你怎么做到的
I'd like to know how.

495
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,588
为什么？
Why?

496
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,162
嫉妒了？
Jealous?

497
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,536
兄弟，我明白
Hey, man, I get it.

498
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,197
三百年前，你把这片
Three-hundred years ago
you helped build

499
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,536
鸟不拉屎的流放地建成城市
a backwater penal colony
into something.

500
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,473
是你起的头，但后来你离开了
You started it,
but then you left.

501
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,637
率确来说，你逃走了
Actually, you ran from it.

502
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,448
我坚持了下来，看看四周
I saw it through.
Look around.

503
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,279
现在是吸血鬼统治这个城市
Vampires rule this city now.

504
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,216
是我解决掉了狼人
I got rid of the werewolves.

505
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,583
我甚至设法摆平了女巫
I even found a way
to shut down the witches.

506
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,420
鲜血源源不断，狂欢从未停止
The blood never stops flowing,
and the party never ends.

507
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,856
你想加入？
You wanna pass on through?

508
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,394
你想待上一阵子？
You wanna stay a while?

509
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,498
没问题，我的就是你的
Great.
What's mine is yours,

510
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,066
但终究还是我的
but it is mine.

511
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,830
我的家园，我的家族，我的规矩
My home.
My family. My rules.

512
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,238
如果有人打破了规矩呢？
And if someone breaks those rules?

513
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,937
他们就得死
They die.

514
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,405
弱者才会手下留情
Mercy is for the weak.

515
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,070
这也是你教我的
You taught me that, too.

516
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,245
还有，我不是王子，朋友
And I'm not
the Prince of the Quarter, friend.

517
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,380
我是国王！
I'm the King!

518
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,022
给我放尊重点
Show me some respect.

519
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,811
你的朋友会在周末前死去
Your friend will be dead
by the weekend.

520
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,710
也就是说我打破了你的规矩
Which means I've broken
one of your rules...

521
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,010
可惜你杀不死我
...and yet I cannot be killed.

522
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,954
因为我永生不死
I am immortal.

523
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,020
现在谁说了算啊，朋友？
Who has the power now, friend?

524
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,526
他甘愿放弃一切
ELlJAH: He's willing
to give up everything.

525
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,332
醒醒吧，以利亚
这有什么好奇怪的呢？
Come on, Elijah.
Does that really surprise you?

526
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,664
我可以看得出
I can already see it.

527
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,967
他正步步得势
He's spiraling.

528
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,008
他肆无忌惮地发泄他的怒火
He's lashing out in blind rage.

529
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,611
上次见他这样发脾气
You know, the last time
I saw him like this

530
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,110
一发就是两百年
it lasted two hundred years.

531
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,647
那就让他耍性子
回来吧
Then leave him to his
temper tantrum and come home.

532
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,309
但愿这场灾难
With any luck,
this misadventure

533
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,852
能带给我们些许清净
will allow us a reprieve
from all of his insanity.

534
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,722
就差一点
He was so close.

535
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,552
当他听到胎儿的心跳
我可以从他的眼中看到
When he heard the baby's heartbeat,
I could see it in his eyes.

536
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,820
他想要这个孩子
He--
He wanted it.

537
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,594
他几乎尝到了幸福的滋味
He could almost taste happiness.

538
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,700
但是他的坏脾气毁了一切
And now his temper
has destroyed it.

539
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,697
即使我能让他恢复理智
Even if I was to return
him to sanity,

540
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,702
他也失去了马赛尔的信任
he just lost Marcel's trust.

541
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,634
看来
So....

542
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,708
我得赶紧去接那个女孩了
I'm almost out
of time to get the girl.

543
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,069
接她？
Get her?

544
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,438
你疯了吗？
Have you lost your mind?

545
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,806
我们是开孤儿院的吗？
Are we running an orphanage now?

546
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,243
你怎么说尼克劳斯都行
Say what you will about Niklaus,

547
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,906
但我以自己生命担保
but on my life,

548
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,949
我不会让那个孩子有任何不测
I'm not letting anything happen
to that baby.

549
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,655
你找到他就通知我
You find him,
and then you call me.

550
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,417
别担心，我知道怎么应付克劳斯
Don't worry.
I know how to deal with Klaus.

551
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,355
是这样吗？
ELlJAH: Is that so?

552
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,986
怎么不说清楚点？
Please elaborate.

553
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,688
以利亚米卡森
Elijah Mikaelson.

554
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,234
不用，我来，没事的
No. I got it.
It's all good.

555
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,044
是时候我俩好好聊聊了
It's time we had a little chat.

556
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,012
有什么要说的就快说
Well, if you're gonna talk, talk.

557
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,311
我还有事呢
I got things to do.

558
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,923
瞧你，一百年过去了
Oh, my, you have grown
quite confident

559
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,320
你变得这么有自信了，是不是？
over the last century,
haven't you?

560
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,427
我？是你和你弟弟变狂妄了吧
Me? I'd say it's you
and your brother got cocky,

561
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,187
来我的地盘就像到自己家一样
coming to my town
like you own the place.

562
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,831
这里确实曾是我们的地盘
Well, we did own the place, once.

563
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,632
回想起来，那时我们都过得很开心
We were all quite happy here,
as I recall.

564
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,291
但我们始终控制不了
Although we could never control

565
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,403
法语区那些烦人的女巫
those pesky witches
at the French Quarter.

566
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,902
你怎么做到的？
How do you do it?

567
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,174
你弟弟问过我同样的问题
Your brother asked me
the same question.

568
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,401
我也给了他同样的回答：这是我的事
I gave him the same answer:
it's my business.

569
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,945
法语区所有的一切都是我的事
Everything in the Quarter
is my business.

570
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,580
克劳斯非常友善地回到这里
Klaus comes into town
all nice and friendly.

571
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,844
后来开始对我所做的一切嗤之以鼻
Then he starts looking
down his nose at what I done,

572
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,544
就好像一切都是他某幅
Iike it's some cheap knock off

573
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,983
破画的廉价仿冒品
of one of his dumb paintings.

574
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,817
然后他就像个小贱人一样生气了
Then he gets pissed off
like a little bitch

575
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,083
咬了我的一个手下
and bites one of my guys.

576
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,557
对克劳斯这种不良行为我表示歉意
Well, I do apologize for
Klaus' poor behavior.

577
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,391
我想你该知道他咬一下
I assume you know
that that bite

578
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,658
会在几天内让你朋友丧命
will kill your friend
within a matter of days.

579
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,403
当然，尼克劳斯的血能治愈他
Of course,
Niklaus' blood would cure him.

580
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,970
什么？
What?

581
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,702
是的，显然混合种的血
可以治愈狼人的咬伤
Yes. Apparently, the blood of the
Hybrid will cure a werewolf bite.

582
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,746
相当方便容易的东西啊
Quite a handy little thing

583
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,412
特别是在需要谈判筹码的时候
when one needs leverage
in negotiation.

584
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,516
什么谈判？
What kind of negotiations
we talking about?

585
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,177
归还女巫简安的尸体
Return the body of
the witch Jane-Anne,

586
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,583
允许她的族人把她好好安葬
allow her people
to put her to rest.

587
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,053
你怎么关心起女巫来了？
What do you care
about the witches?

588
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,221
这就是我的事了，不是吗？
Well, that's my business now,
isn't it?

589
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,133
他的时间到了
His time is up.

590
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,967
你现在打算怎样，苏菲？
What are you gonna do now, Sophie?

591
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,873
我会照我说的去做
(SlGHS) I'm gonna do what I said
I was gonna do.

592
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,874
做什么？杀了那个女孩？
杀了你自己吗？
What? Kill the girl?
Kill yourself?

593
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,947
克劳斯不在乎那个孩子
Klaus does not care
about the child.

594
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,417
我在乎
ELlJAH: I do.

595
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,591
我带来了证据
我想帮你们的证据
And I bring proof
of my intent to help you.

596
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,892
你们已故朋友的尸体
The body of your fallen friend,

597
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,863
我从马赛尔那里要来的
which I procured
from Marcel himself.

598
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,359
简安
Jane-Anne?

599
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,167
愿她安息
May she be granted peace.

600
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,069
克劳斯会答应你的条件
Klaus will agree to your terms.

601
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,409
我还需要一点时间
I just need a little more time.

602
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,379
给过你时间了，时间已过
You had your time.
It's passed.

603
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,040
闭嘴
爱格妮丝
Shut up, Agnes.

604
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,254
先接受交易吧
眼下
For now,
accept the deal.

605
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,086
那个女孩和孩子要安然无恙
The girl and the child
remain unharmed...

606
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,962
否则克劳斯会把你们全杀光
...or Klaus
will kill you all.

607
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,132
我也会帮他
And I will help him.

608
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,720
难道我没说清楚我想一个人静一静吗？
Have I not made clear
my desire to be left alone?

609
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,047
每十年你至少会有一次
Well, you demand
to be left alone

610
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,521
要求一个人静一静
at least once a decade.

611
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,354
你的话已经不再有影响力了
Your words have ceased
to have impact.

612
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,020
你为什么一直叨念着那个孩子？
Why must you keep harping on
about the baby?

613
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,131
那个孩子绝对不会被生出来
That child will never be born.

614
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,770
事实上，海莉现在很可能已经死了
In fact, Hayley is
probably dead already.

615
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,534
你绝对不能就这样离开
You will not walk away from this.

616
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,173
放开我
Let me go.

617
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,206
休想
I will not!

618
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,048
别逼我再说一次
Don't make me say it again.

619
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,119
我不会放开你的，我绝对不会
I will not let go.
I will never let go.

620
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,989
即使我永世都得
Even if I have to spend eternity

621
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,651
拯救你，让你摆脱固执、任性
saving you from your own
stubborn, petulant, 

622
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,422
卑鄙的自己
vile self.

623
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,196
如果我必须像父亲过去那样殴打你
If I have to beat you as
father used to beat you

624
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,893
来提醒你你的人性
to remind you
of your own humanity.

625
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,667
提醒你去关心一切
To care about anything.

626
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,478
你实在是太可悲了，以利亚
You're beyond pathetic, Elijah.

627
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,318
谁更可悲？
Who's more pathetic?

628
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,495
是那个盼望让家庭完整的人
The one who sees hope to
make his family whole...

629
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:58,167
还是那个
只能从自己的恐惧中看世界的懦夫？
...or the coward who can only see
the world through his own fear?

630
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,362
几个世纪以来，我什么都不在乎
I haven't cared about
anything for centuries.

631
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,371
你到底为什么在乎？
Why on earth do you?

632
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,300
因为我让你失望了
Because I failed you.

633
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,841
因为第一次父亲动手打你
Because the first time
our father laid a hand on you,

634
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,677
我应该直接打死他
I should've struck him dead.

635
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,615
我还向你保证过
And I made a promise to you.

636
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,457
家庭总是
Always.
Forever.

637
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,562
永远高于一切
Family above all.

638
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,309
你真是个多愁善感的傻瓜
You are a sentimental fool.

639
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,777
也许吧
Perhaps.

640
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,756
尽管如此，我也坚持了这么久了
不是吗？
But I've lasted this long in spite of it,
haven't l?

641
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,541
家庭的联系赐予了我们无尽的力量
ELlJAH: The bond of family blesses us
with an immeasurable power.

642
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,885
但是我们也要接受随之而来的一切
But we also
must accept what comes with it.

643
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,540
它带给我们无条件
无歉意去爱的
It gives us a responsibility,
to love without condition.

644
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,410
责任
Without apology.

645
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,354
我们永远都不能放弃这种联系的力量
We can never waiver
from the power of that bond,

646
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,584
即使受到考验
even when it is tested.

647
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:10,227
这种联系滋春着我们
给我们力量
The bond nourishes us,
gives us strength.

648
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,071
没有这力量，我们就一无所有
Without that power,
we are nothing.

649
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,177
这座城市曾经是我的家
我不在的日子里
This town was my home once,
and in my absence,

650
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,746
马赛尔得到了我想要的一切
Marcel has got everything
I ever wanted.

651
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,079
权力，忠诚
Power.
Loyalty.

652
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,481
家庭
Family.

653
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,422
我按自己样子塑造他，他却青出于蓝
I made him in my image,
and he has bettered me.

654
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,455
我要他的一切
I want what he has.

655
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,423
我要夺回来
I want it back.

656
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,793
我要成为王
I want to be king.

657
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,508
所以这孩子对你来说
ELlJAH: So, is that all
this child means to you?

658
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,575
只是夺权的工具？
A grab for power?

659
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,178
那对你来说意味着什么呢？
What does it mean to you?

660
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,285
我觉得…
I think...

661
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,950
这个孩子能够给你你一直以为
...this child could offer you
the one thing

662
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,788
你得不到的东西
that you've never
believed you had.

663
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,820
是什么？
And what's that?

664
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,288
家庭无条件的爱
The unconditional
love of family.

665
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,807
告诉苏菲德弗罗，我们成交了
Tell Sophie Deveraux
we have a deal.

666
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,821
你还好吧？
You all right?

667
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,516
只是吸入了灰尘
Just dust.

668
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,690
这地方真古老
This place is ancient.

669
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,860
是的，但这里应该够我们用了
Yes.
It should serve our purposes.

670
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,164
这是我们在法语区的庇护所
It's a sanctuary from
our business in the Quarter.

671
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,001
现在你是这个家中最重要的人
Right now, you're the most
important person in this family.

672
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,642
你需要一个安定的家
You need a good home.

673
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,180
我很好奇
So, I'm curious.

674
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,679
在这段时间里
有没有人间过你的感受？
In all this time, has anyone
asked you how you feel?

675
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,113
和一个疯子一夜情之后
About having a miracle baby

676
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,152
怀上一个奇迹般孩子的感受吗？
with a psychotic one-night stand?

677
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,153
身为一个母亲的感受
About being a mother.

678
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,588
我…
I....

679
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,100
我一出生就被遗弃了
I was abandoned when I was born,

680
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,830
我一变成狼，我的畚父母
and my adoptive parents
kicked me out

681
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,133
就把我赶了出去
the second that I turned into a wolf.

682
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:37,542
所以我真的不太知道
做母亲的感受
So, I don't really know how I feel
about being a mother

683
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,776
因为我从来就没有过好母亲
because I never
really had a good one.

684
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,785
我会一直保护你
I will always protect you.

685
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,883
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

686
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,625
高尚的以利亚向来信守承诺
And noble Elijah
always keeps his word.

687
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,989
搞定了吗？
Is it done?

688
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,931
事实上，搞定了
As a matter of fact, yes.

689
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,397
你见不得人的交易非常顺利
Your underhanded deal
worked quite well.

690
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,534
马赛尔非常高兴地接受了我的血
Marcel was only too happy
to accept my blood,

691
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,404
正如他接受了我由衷的道歉
even as he accepted
my heartfelt apologies.

692
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,341
他的手下提艾里还活着
His man Thierry yet lives

693
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,414
我依旧是法语区受欢迎的客人
and I remain a welcome guest
in the French Quarter.

694
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,177
我现在担心的
My only concern now

695
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,015
是那群无耻的女巫
is this coven
of impudent witches.

696
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,020
我相信她们是可敬的
I believe them to be honorable.

697
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,389
她们确实放了海莉
They did release Hayley to me.

698
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,924
尽管她们还没有完全坦白
Although they haven't been
entirely forthcoming.

699
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,527
马赛尔显然有什么她们需要的东西
Marcel obviously has something
that they need.

700
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,858
她们不想他死
They don't want him dead.

701
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,331
一定有原因
There must be a reason why.

702
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,414
我想外面风平浪静了？
I assume it's all quiet out there?

703
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,927
女巫们识相的话就不会使用魔法
The witches know better
than to use magic.

704
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,890
她们知道一旦施魔法我能感受到
They know I can sense it
when they do.

705
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,001
那些老家伙呢？
What about the old ones?

706
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,729
他们很危险
我不想他们伤害你
They're dangerous,
and I don't want them to hurt you.

707
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,430
真祖吗？
The Originals?

708
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,576
黛维娜，强大如你
Davina, as powerful as you are?

709
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,542
他们毫无机会的
They don't stand
a chance.

710
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,242
除了他用来
ELlJAH: In addition
to the secret weapon

711
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,611
控制女巫的秘密武器
he uses to control the witches,

712
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,913
马赛尔组建了一支小型的吸血鬼部队
Marcel has assembled
a small army of vampires.

713
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,458
齐心协力，我们可以从内部摧毁他们
Working together,
we could destroy them from the inside.

714
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,783
蕾贝卡呢？
And what of Rebekah?

715
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,552
她公主性子耍完没有
Has she stopped her
pouting long enough

716
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,026
要不要一起来找乐子呢？
to join the fun?

717
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,394
她已经明显表达了没兴趣
She has made her
disinterest quite clear.

718
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,930
我想是被插了太多次匕首
One too many times daggered

719
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,764
被关了太多次棺材了
and shoved in a box, I gather?

720
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,839
也或许她不赞同
Or, perhaps, she doesn't share

721
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,570
你坚定地认为我可以被拯牧的信念
your unwavering belief
that I can be saved.

722
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,640
蕾贝卡也许会给我们惊喜
Rebekah may surprise us yet.

723
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,845
毕竟我们都许下了同样的誓官
After all, we all
swore the same vow.

724
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,347
我希望她待得远远的
I hope she stays far away.

725
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,960
因为我想要收回这座城市
Because in my desire
to reclaim this town,

726
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,359
想要从马赛尔手中偷回他最珍视的东西
to steal from Marcel that which
he holds most dear,

727
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:12,093
我意识到最重要的一个弱点
I have realized one massive
vulnerability.

728
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,702
马赛尔最可能利用的一个弱点
One weakness that
Marcel could exploit.

729
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,633
是什么？
And what is that?

730
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,333
你
You.

731
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,946
原谅我，我的哥哥
Forgive me, my brother.

732
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,654
爱里没有权力
There is no power in love.

733
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,018
仁慈让你软弱
Mercy makes you weak.

734
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,260
家人让你软弱
Family makes you weak.

735
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,960
我要想赢得这场战争
If I'm going to win this war...

736
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,963
我必须孤身奋战
...I have to do it alone.

737
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:56,342
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
