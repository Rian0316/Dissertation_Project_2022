00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:06,356
我看不明白你的邮件
I didn't understand your e-mail.

2
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:09,426
你能再说一遍吗? 刚才断断续续的
Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.

3
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:12,529
我看不明白你的邮件
I didn't understand your e-mail.

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,499
没错 我得稍微发挥下创造力
Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:19,937
因为我键盘上的S R M键失灵了
because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,940
"亲耐的Aby 嫩请你名田
"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be

00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:27,544
开车松窝去活车站吗?
to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"

8
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,515
你答应了吗?
So, is that a yes?

9
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,051
Sheldon 你干嘛不买台新电脑?
Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer?

10
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,986
你知道那台已经太旧了
You know that one's out-of-date.

11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:38,222
但我喜欢这台电脑
Oh, but I like this computer.

12
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:41,892
画面快不行了 连声音都断断续续的
The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.

13
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,294
抱歉 我没听清楚
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

14
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:46,530
画面快不行了
The video is failing,

15
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,665
连声音都断断续续的
and the sound is cutting out.

16
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,870
抱歉 再说一遍 声音断断续续的
I'm sorry, one more time. The sound is cutting out.

17
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:57,775
我看不清楚!
I can't read that!

18
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,910
画面不清楚!
The video is failing!

19
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,147

Get a new computer.

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,314

00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,416
买台新电脑

This is cool.

37
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,434
我俩上次一起搭东西是什么时候的事了?
When was the last time you and I built something together?

38
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:49,136
科学领域的话 已经是一年多以前了
Scientifically? A little over a year ago.

39
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:51,439
乐高的话 上星期就在我家搭过
LEGOs? Last week in my room.

40
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,975
如果你一上手就散架的
If there was a Nobel prize for Millennium Falcons

41
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:56,944
千年隼号模型能得个诺贝尔奖 那就赞了
that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.

42
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,224
嘿 两位!
Hey, guys!

43
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:58,745
嘿
Hey.

44
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,981
你们怎么来了?
What are you doing here?

45
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:01,616
我们听说某两个性感的科学家
We heard there were some sexy scientists

46
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,517
- 奋斗了一个周末  - 没错
- working hard all weekend.  - Yeah,

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,988
带了些午餐给你们 一会我们就去找那俩鲜肉了
so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.

48
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,023
浓汤 三明治 还有嘲讽
Soup, sandwiches and emasculation,

49
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,259
就跟我妈妈做的午餐一样
just like my mom used to make.

50
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,493
进展如何?
So, how's it goin'?

51
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:13,995
还不错 就是有点慢
Good. Slow.

52
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,730
有很多无聊的准备工作要做 但等弄完了
There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that

53
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:16,731
进程就会快些
it should go quicker.

54
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,466
有什么我们能帮忙的?
Is there anything we can do to help?

55
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,601
好吧 这部分倒没什么技术含量
You know what, this part isn't that technical.

56
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:21,702
你完全可以做
You actually could.

57
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:25,006
真的吗? 你揭穿我了 还是算了吧
Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.

58
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,008
我们真的能帮上忙吗?
Can we really help?

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,509
我们焊接这些主板的时候 如果你们能用特氟龙胶带
While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great

60
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,045
把那些管件缠起来 那就太好了
if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

61
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,046
我给你们示范一个
I'll show you how to do one.

62
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,681
嘿... 你俩潜心研究多年
Hey, w... wouldn't it be funny

63
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,249
万一我一不小心
if after all your years of hard work,

64
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,286
搞出个科学突破 会不会很搞笑?
I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough?

65
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,859
他觉得这一点都不好笑
He doesn't think that's funny.

66
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,008
我尽快赶过来了
I got here as quickly as I could.

67
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,311
你来晚了
You're too late.

68
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,398
Sheldon 这太愚蠢了
Sheldon, this is silly.

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,735
实验室的猴子死掉 你还伤心了呢
You got emotional when that lab monkey died.

70
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:31,672
那个实验室的猴子还用手势跟我表白了呢
That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.

71
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,217
好吧
Great.

72
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:46,554
这歌会在我脑海里播一整天了
Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.

73
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,856
听着... 请你
Look, I'm... I'm sorry

74
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:51,192
节哀顺变 但我觉得
for your loss, but I think

75
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,061
我可以送你样东西 让你感觉好些
I have something that might make you feel better.

76
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:57,231
我给你买了新电脑!
I got you a new computer!

77
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,335
你怎么能这么做?
How could you do that?

78
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:03,170
怎么做?
Do what?

79
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,374
选购新电脑是个非常私人的仪式
Choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual.

80
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,742
你夺走了我
You have taken away

81
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:10,611
几个星期的苦恼思索 繁琐调查
weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research,

82
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:13,981
优柔寡断的不眠夜晚 我...
sleepless nights filled with indecision. I j...

83
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,984
我今天失去的还不够多吗?
Haven't I lost enough today?

84
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:22,890
那个店员说这台很棒的
Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.

85
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,859
哦! 店员!
Oh! Oh, the guy!

86
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,827
不好意思
Oh, pardon me.

87
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,462
我... 还真不知道你会跟店员沟通呢
I... I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy.

88
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,030
好吧 告诉我
Yeah, tell me,

89
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,600
那店员选的带4K显示器
did the guy choose one with a 4K display

90
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,001
和Thunderbolt接口吗?
and a Thunderbolt port?

91
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,202
- 有啊  - 是吗?
- Yes.  - Yeah?

92
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:36,370
那... 那店员选的电脑
D... Did the guy make sure

93
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,140
有1T的固态硬盘吗?
that this has a one-terabyte solid-state drive?

94
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,674
- 有啊  - 是吗? 好吧
- Yes.  - Yeah? Oh, well,

95
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,878
那店员是科罗拉多路电脑专卖店的Rick吗?
was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,845
没错
Yes.

97
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,213
好吧 他的确挺厉害的
Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.

98
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,085
管身用反光带包好
After you wrap the body in reflective tape,

99
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,254
两端用特氟龙胶带包起来 这样就密封了
the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.

100
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,389
- 像这样?  - 很好
- Like this?  - Oh. Yeah, perfect.

101
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,124
手指纤细还是很有帮助的
And it helps to have small, delicate fingers.

102
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,726
如果你没法做得跟我和Howard一样快
So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast

103
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,361
也不用灰心
as me and Howard.

104
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,063
我觉得这些焊锡不够我们
I don't know if we have enough solder

105
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,298
弄完这些主板
to finish these circuit boards.

106
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,529
我们昨天有一整卷呢
We had a full spool yesterday.

107
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,331
我能怎么说
What can I say,

108
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,936
我玩得疯狂 焊得更疯狂
I play hard, I solder even harder.

109
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:12,506
有时候他在家里光着膀子焊接
Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off.

110
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,508
看着就像啤酒广告似的
It's like a beer commercial.

111
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,213
我们得去趟五金店
Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.

112
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,515
连焊锡都没准备够你怎么好意思称自己为科学家?
How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?

113
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,318
嗯 这是个有趣的故事 我们有很多
Well, funny story. So, we have plenty

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,253
锡铅比为60/40的焊锡
of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder,

115
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,915
但这圈焊丝看着就像63/37的...
but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to...

116
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,555
亲
Honey, honey,

117
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,960
亲 先别说了 这故事一点都不好玩
honey, let me stop you. That is not a funny story.

118
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,830
你想和我们一起去吗?
You want to come with us?

119
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,355
我正越卷越熟练了呢
I'm kind of getting into the groove here.

120
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:37,976
嗯 互换一下
Yeah, you guys run to the store

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,821
你们去商店 让女人们来搞科研吧
and let the women handle the science for a change.

122
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:41,500
好的
Okay.

123
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,537
我们会尽快回来的
We'll be back as soon as we can.

124
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,807
嗯... 所以说
Okay, so what...

125
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,009
焊锡是什么鬼?
is solder?

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,148
我认为我应该把它设置好
I suppose I should set this up.

127
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,785
还是你准备把这个乐趣也剥夺走?
Or would you like to rob me of that, too?

128
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,754
别烦人了 不然我就把所有的W的发音
Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds

129
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,791
发成WH
for words that just have a W.

130
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:04,425
你才不会
You wouldn't.

131
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:07,761
"宽着"
"Hwatch" me.

132
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,064
好吧 我很抱歉
Fine. I'm sorry.

133
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,932
谢谢你这个体贴的礼物
Thank you for the thoughtful gift.

134
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,534
我十分感激
I really do appreciate it.

135
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:17,938
你也知道 我很怀念我的旧笔记本电脑
As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop.

136
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,473
但我确定 随着时间流逝 它会...
But I'm sure, in time, that this one will...

137
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,408
天了噜
Jeepers creepers,

138
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,611
开机好快!
that started up fast!

139
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,646
我猜你就会喜欢
I thought you might like it.

140
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,848
看看这4K的分辨率
Look at the 4K resolution.

141
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,617
下次我们视频时
Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count

142
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,620
我准备把你鼻毛全数一遍
all those nostril hairs.

143
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:35,256
或者你也能凝视我
Or you could just look into my eyes.

144
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,358
但你只有两个眼睛啊
But you only have two eyes.

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,494
你的鼻毛可是多了去了
You got a lot of nostril hairs.

146
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,987
行吧 你开心就好
Well, you know, as long as you're happy.

147
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,000
我确实很开心
I am.

148
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:48,636
Rick说你可以把旧的拿去回收
And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.

149
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:51,539
哦 不不不不用了 谢谢
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

150
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,140
但他说你可以换店铺积分
Oh, but he said you can get store credit.

151
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,809
呃 我... 我只是不想把它回收了
Well, no, I just... I-I don't want to recycle it.

152
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,411
我也不想要积分
And I don't want store credit.

153
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,312
但我们为什么不...
But why wouldn't...

154
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,147
我们能换话题么?
Can we please change the subject?

155
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,716
好吧
Okay.

156
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:06,053
那我们换成"你为什么这么不自在"怎么样?
How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?

157
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,154
我没有不自在
I'm not being weird.

158
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:09,390
我...
I...

159
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,392
这不好解释
It's hard to explain.

160
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:15,296
Sheldon 告诉我吧
Sheldon, just tell me.

161
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,198
如果给你看的话可能会简单些
It might be easier to show you.

162
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,367
好啊
Okay.

163
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,804
我们得坐你的车
We'd have to take your car.

164
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,973
可以
All right.

165
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:31,979
我还需要你签署保密协议
And I'm gonna need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

166
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:36,317
我们一起睡之前我也签过
Well, I signed one before we slept together.

167
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,485
再签也不会怎样
Why not now?

168
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,392
Penny说她们建原型玩得很开心
Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype.

169
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,063
还记得以前她只有混夜店才开心吗?
Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?

170
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,699
我知道啊 我正在慢慢拉她下水
I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly.

171
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,835
明年她就会有一整套硬币收藏了
This time next year she'll have a coin collection.

172
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,236
打扰了
Excuse me.

173
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,505
你们想免费看一个将要上映的电影吗?
You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?

174
00:07:58,507 --> 00:07:59,406
哦 不好意思 不想
Oh. Sorry, we can't.

175
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:01,375
等等 这是什么电影?
Well, hang on. What movie is it?

176
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,178
我不能告诉你 但是是威尔·史密斯演的
Oh, I can't tell you. But it does star Will Smith.

177
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,046
等等
Wait.

178
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,481
我打赌这是自杀小队
I bet it's Suicide Squad.

179
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,283
我们去看看吧
Let's check it out.

180
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,484
那她们怎么办啊?
What about the girls?

181
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,286
Penny不是才说她们玩得很开心吗?
Penny just said they're having fun.

182
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:14,822
说实话 你想一整个下午都在那
Honestly, you want to wrap tape around

183
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,290
给一大堆管状元件包胶带吗?
a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?

184
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,492
好吧 我们去看
Okay, we'll take 'em.

185
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,327
但我发誓
Okay. But, I swear,

186
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,329
如果是鲨鱼黑帮2
if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2,

187
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,699
至少要达到他演的第一部那个水准
it better be at least as good as the original.

188
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,602
简直太疯狂了哈?
I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?

189
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,738
我从内布拉斯加来到这里想当演员
I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress,

190
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,707
现在却坐在加州理工学院的工程实验室里
and now I'm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech

191
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,911
帮忙组装高科技导航系统的原型机
helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.

192
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,913
是很不可思议 更不可思议的是
It is crazy. It's also crazy

193
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:43,417
我已经卷了十四个而你才卷了三个
that I've made 14 of these and you've made three.

194
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,822
嘿 男人们都去哪了?
Hey. Where are the guys?

195
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,224
哦 他们去商店买焊锡了
Oh, they went to the store to get solder,

196
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:53,827
就是那种融化了能做科学小制作的金属
which is metal you melt to make science things.

197
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,330
你从什么时候开始周末也工作了?
Since when do you work on weekends?

198
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,831
我是天体物理学家
I'm an astrophysicist.

199
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,100
行星们可不放假
The stars don't take a day off.

200
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,903
你独自在家没人和你玩吗?
You were home alone and had no one to play with?

201
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:06,173
清洁女佣在那 但她不喜欢我
Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me.

202
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:08,709
需要帮忙吗?
You need any help?

203
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,345
我们可是有光速女王在这呢
Not with Lightning McQueen here.

204
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,080
我觉得我们能行
I think we're good.

205
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:14,648
好啊 没问题
Okay. That's cool.

206
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,984
我猜除了我大家都参与进这个项目里了
I guess everybody's involved in this project but me.

207
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,753
所以... 回见
So... see ya.

208
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,457
我好难过
I feel bad.

209
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,525
我们应该告诉他留下来么?
Should we have asked him to stay?

210
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,694
是啊
Yes.

211
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,266
你能告诉我我们准备去哪吗?
Will you please tell me where we're going?

212
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,936
不好意思 你只能知道你需要知道的东西
Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.

213
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,172
我正开车呢
I'm driving the car.

214
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,541
我需要知道去那儿
I need to know.

215
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,608
向右(向右和对的同一个词)
Right.

216
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,310
那么我们要去哪儿?
So where are we going?

217
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,814
我刚才是说向右转 你刚好错过去了
No, I meant turn right, and you missed it.

218
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,483
或许你的确需要知道去哪
Maybe you do need to know.

219
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:55,022
我们要怎么像女孩儿们交代?
What are we gonna tell the girls?

220
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,190
那根本不是事儿
It's not a problem.

221
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,324
我是说不撒谎
I mean without lying.

222
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,693
那就是个问题了
And now you've made it a problem.

223
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,762
别啊 咱俩聪明着呢
Come on. We're a couple of smart guys.

224
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,630
我们肯定能找到
I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this

225
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,299
让咱们看起来有道理的借口解释的
that doesn't make us look bad.

226
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,103
噢!
Oh!

227
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,904
他们得开车去圣贝纳迪诺
The boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino

228
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,740
买焊锡 结果胎破了
for the solder and got a flat.

229
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,245
他们相信了
They bought it.

230
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,813
我们回去之前
But we're gonna have to

231
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,448
得记得把备胎装上
put the spare on before we go back.

232
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,150
你蛮擅长扯谎的
Oh, you're good at this.

233
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,486
我习惯了胡说八道
Well, I lie a lot.

234
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,988

你给谁发短信呢?
Who are you texting?

243
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,074
Raj 他很想看这片儿
Raj. He really wants to see this movie.

244
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,042
他赶不上了
Oh, he'll never make it in time.

245
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,912
我知道 只是想让他难受一下
I know. I want to make him feel bad.

246

哈哈 我和Leonard要看自杀小队了
"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad.

247
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:00,587
剧透提醒: 碰见你的时候会给你剧透的
Spoiler alert: when I see you I'm gonna spoil it."

248
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,456
你真是最佳损友
You're a good friend.

249
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,432
好吧
Okay.

250

Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,174
为什么呀?
Why?

我要用下面摩擦摩擦他们的模型
I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.

What's going on?

Leonard和Howard不是胎破了
Leonard and Howard don't have a flat.

255

256
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,687
混蛋 难以置信
Son of a bitch. Un-freakin' believable.

257
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,956
我要告诉他们
Oh. You know what? I'm gonna let them know

258
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,258
我和你们在一起 他们的牛皮吹破了
that I'm here with you and that they're busted.

259
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,560
别啊 别急啊
No. You know what? Don't. Don't.

260
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,061
先让他们觉得得逞了
Let's let them think they're getting away with it.

261
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,131
让我们看看他们能给自己挖个多大的坑
Yeah, let's see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.

262
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,599
有意思
Mm-hmm. Interesting.

263
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,734
虽然没有蛋蛋放在恒温器上那么爽
I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat,

264
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,937
但是我喜欢
but I like it.

265
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,288

Just wait.

267

00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,195
等着瞧
Just wait.

基本上都是我曾经有过的所有东西
It's basically everything I've ever owned.

275

每本书
Um, every book,

276
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:42,731
每件T恤 每件坏了的电器
every T-shirt, every piece of broken electronics.

277
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,901
所有的
Just... all of it.

278
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:51,407
所有的?
All of it?

279
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,309
我有个保鲜袋
I have a Ziploc bag

280
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:56,479
装着所有用过的保鲜袋
filled with all my old Ziploc bags.

Okay.

282
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,256
呃...
Well...

283

我想告诉你
I would like to tell you

284
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,094
这没什么
that there is

285
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:16,065
好羞耻的
nothing here to be ashamed of.

286
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,468
我需要点时间适应一下
So I'm gonna need a minute.

287
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:27,176
他们回来后咱们怎么办?
All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?

288
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,644
我想到了
I know.

289
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:31,814
你们应该和我来一发
You guys should totally be making out with me.

290
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,352
亲爱的 我知道你觉得那样的笑话很有意思
Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny,

291
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:38,087
但是你真的觉得能
but do you really think you could handle

292
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,522
一次性搞定我们两个么?
making out with both of us?

293
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,525
不能 女士
No, ma'am.

294
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,530
要不这样?
Okay. Okay, how about this?

295
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:48,631
他们不知道你和我们在一起
They don't know you're here with us,

296
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,866
所以你躲在柜子里 等他们回来的时候
so you hide in the closet. When they show up,

297
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,434
我们听听关于他们去哪了
we'll hear whatever their dumb story is

298
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,270
会扯些什么鬼故事 在假装相信他们
about where they were, we'll pretend to believe them,

299
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:57,006
等他们觉得自己得逞的以后 你再跳出来
and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.

300
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,908
- 不错的主意  - 我喜欢!
- Yeah, that's pretty good.  - I love it!

301
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,143
我会说 牛皮吹破了!
I'll be all like, "Busted!"

302
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,611
他们会说 什么?!
And they'll be like, "What?!"

303
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:05,648
然后我们就说 耶!
And then we'll all be like, "Oh, yeah!"

304
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,384
我明白了
Yeah, I-I get it.

305
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,586
我也不会想跟自己来一发的
I wouldn't make out with me, either.

306
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,891
这里面是我用过的每一个收音机
In here is every clock radio I've ever owned.

307
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,793
计算器 录像带
Calculators, VHS tapes.

308
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,195
对了 还有
Yeah. Oh.

309
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,397
运动器材
Sporting equipment.

310
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,634
你会有运动器材?
Y-You have sporting equipment?

311
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,970
呃 只是个我哥哥拿来
Well, oh, it's just a... it's a... a golf ball

312
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,972
砸我头的高尔夫球
that my brother threw at my head.

313
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:32,741
你仍然能摸到凹痕
You can still feel the dent.

314
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:36,011
就在曲棍球砸出的印子旁边
It's right next to the hockey puck dent.

315
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,950
为啥你还有一箱子松果?
Okay, why do you have a bin of pinecones?

316
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:43,385
我小时候收集的
I used to collect them as a child.

317
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,688
它的鳞片螺旋是一个
The spiral of scales open in

318
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,423
斐波那契数列
the Fibonacci sequence.

319
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,325
当你把这事告诉你哥的时候
A fact that, when you tell your brother,

320
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,261
那边就会朝你头上扔过来一个高尔夫球
gets a golf ball thrown at your head.

321
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:59,134
为什么你觉得应该留着这些东西呢?
So, why do you feel you need to save these things?

322
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,370
我想说是因为怀旧
I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

323
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:04,440
但是每次一想到要把东西扔了
but every time I think of throwing anything away,

324
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,008
我就开始耳鸣
my ears start to ring,

325
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,210
心里也七上八下的
and I get butterflies in my stomach.

326
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:09,678
之后就感觉
And then it feels like

327
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
在胃里扑腾的小蝴蝶被老鼠给吃了
the butterflies get eaten by rats,

328
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,116
然后 老鼠又被...
and then, the-the rats get eaten by...

329
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,084
好
Okay.

330
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,719
我懂了 我懂了
I get it. I get it.

331
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,622
食物链的顶端是恐龙
It ends with dinosaurs.

332
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,426
如果让你失望的话 那我很抱歉
I'm sorry if you think less of me.

333
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,263
我没有啊
I don't.

334
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,064
真的吗?
Really?

335
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,066
因为我每次来这儿的时候
'Cause every time I come in here,

336
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,968
都会对自己失望
I think less of me.

337
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,336
为什么?
Why?

338
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,171
因为我是一个骗子
Because I'm a fraud.

339
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,606
不 我声称自己是
No. I purport

340
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,441
思想的巨人
to be a man of the mind.

341
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:43,178
{\an8}(旧事物将被新事物完全替代)

342
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:43,178
是奇点理论的推崇者
I've been such a-a vocal champion of The Singularity,

343
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,014
但是如果我都没法把牙刷扔掉的话
but how can I leave my body behind

344
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,283
我又怎么能把肉体抛诸脑后
and become one with the Internet

345
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,985
和网络共生呢?
when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?

346
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,989
没事的 Sheldon
It's okay, Sheldon.

347
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,426
你知道吗 我... 我也存了很多奇怪的东西
You know, I... I've saved a lot of weird things, too.

348
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,628
比如呢?
Like what?

349
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,563
嗯
Well, um,

350
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:04,967
你知道我
did you know I have a microscope slide

351
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,402
留着放有自己解剖的第一颗大脑的
with a little bit of tissue

352
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,405
一小点细胞组织的载玻片吗?
from the first brain I ever dissected?

353
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,607
我有一个偷偷用来擦鼻子
I have an old teddy bear

354
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,209
还擦了很多年的旧泰迪熊
I secretly wiped my nose on for years.

355
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,686
我们不是在比赛
It's not a contest.

356
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,524
他们来了 去躲起来
Okay, here they come. Go hide.

357
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,592
我出柜的那一刻
Oh, man, when I come out of the closet,

358
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:33,195
一定要狠狠搞他们!
I'm gonna nail those guys!

359
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,299
嗯 我听到了 闭嘴
Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

360
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,039
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hi.

361
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,075
嘿 这是什么?
Hey, what's this?

362
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,010
我们干了件蠢事
Listen, we did a stupid thing.

363
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:51,814
我们去看了电影还撒了谎 感觉很不好
We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad

364
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,515
想补偿下你们
and want to make it up to you.

365
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,284
这些是送你们的 如果你们没生气的话
So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad,

366
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,511
我们想带你们去吃晚饭
we'd love to take you guys to dinner.

367
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,040
好吧
Yeah.

368
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,455
- 想去哪都行  - 好吧
- Anywhere you want.  - Oh. Well,

369
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,557
- 谢谢你的诚实  - 嗯
- thank you for being honest.  - Yeah. You know,

370
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,025
我是想生气来着 但是
I want to be upset, but we did

371
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:04,493
我们玩原型也玩得挺开心的
kind of have fun working on the prototype.

372
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,662
不要原谅他们 继续怒火中烧啊!
Don't forgive them! Stay mad at them!

373
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,132
他在那里干啥呢?
What is he doing in there?

374
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:13,268
搞你们!
Busting you!

375
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:15,938
没事了 他们道歉了
It's okay. They apologized.

376
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,106
对 没事了
Yeah, it's fine.

377
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:21,243
嗯 这有点反高潮啊
Well this is kind of anti-climactic.

378
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,846
你知道什么不反高潮吗?
You know what wasn't anti-climactic?

379
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,547
电影的结尾 听着
The end of the movie. Get this.

380
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,616
不要剧透! 不要剧透!
No spoilers! No spoilers!

381
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,652
他又回到柜子里去了
And he's back in the closet.

382
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,590
准备好吃晚饭了吗?
Ready for dinner?

383
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,792
嗯
Yeah.

384
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,529
我们要叫Raj一块儿去吗?
Should we invite Raj?

385
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,865
要
Yes.

386
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,302
所以 其他人都不知道这个地方吗?
So, no one else knows about this?

387
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,505
只有你知道
Only you.

388
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,709
谢谢你的信任
Thank you for trusting me.

389
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,711
如果不能对她发泄负能量
What good is having a girlfriend

390
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,447
那要女朋友还有何用啊?
if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?

391
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,451
我就是你的负能量垃圾桶啊
That's me, your emotional outhouse.

392
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:06,088
嗯
You know,

393
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,758
如果你哪天决定了要来理一理这里
if you ever decide you want to do something about this,

394
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,427
我... 我会帮你的
I'm... I'm here for you.

395
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,695
谢谢
Thank you.

396
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,998
我都不知道应该怎样开始
I wouldn't even know how to begin.

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,634
一步一步来咯
Baby steps, I guess.

398
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:21,103
嗯
Mm.

399
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,712
我想我可以试试把那个高尔夫球扔了
I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.

400
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,449
好
Oh. Okay.

401
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,286
脑门上的坑就足够我记着这事了
I will always have the dent to remember it by.

402
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,636
你做到了
You did it.

403
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:56,839
你感觉还好吗?
Do you feel okay?

404
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,042
实际上 感觉挺好的
Actually, yes.

405
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,678
真的
I do.

406
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,380
为你骄傲
Well, I'm proud of you.

407
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:07,583
哦 谢谢
Oh. Thanks.

408
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,300
储藏室的事告诉了你 我很开心
I'm glad I told you about the storage unit.

409
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,202
感觉和你更亲密了
Well, I feel closer to you now.

410
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,024
我也感觉和你更亲密了
Oh, I feel closer to you, too.

411
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,292
你知道吗
You know,

412
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:37,929
离我上床睡觉还有好几个小时呢
it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime.

413
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:47,338
你在想什么?
What did you have in mind?

414
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,774
你太美了
You look amazing.

415
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:57,815
我想说 分辨率实在是太高了
I mean, this resolution is remarkable.

416
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:02,287
讲真让我回家就为了跟我视频啊?
I really had to go home for this?

417
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,624
对 感觉就像你人在我卧室里一样
Yes, but it's like you're right here in the room.

418
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:09,727
但是 我不在
And yet, I'm not.

419
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,298
感觉可以伸出手摸摸你呢
But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.

420
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,466
但是 你不行
And yet, you can't.

421
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,137
我知道了啦!
I know!
