1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,490
孩子们 圣诞节是一家团聚的日子
Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,320
在2006年的圣诞 我有三个选择
So in December of 2006, I had three options.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,150
和我妈妈还有 他的新男友克林特过圣诞
Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,720
也可以去找我爸爸 还有他的小甜心
spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,930
或者乖乖待在斯塔藤岛
or head down to Staten Island to spend it

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,130
和我那异常虔诚的堂姐斯坦西 还有她的家人一起度过
with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,270
但是以上三个选择我都放弃了
So I opted for none of the above

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,190
决定在曼哈顿过2006年的圣诞
and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan...

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,410
和我的特殊家人一起过圣诞
celebrating with my other family.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,090
我最后一场考试在 今天下午五点
Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today,

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,550
在考试之前 我都要在图书馆里复习
so until then, I will be at the law library at school,

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
没有任何事情可以改变我的计划
but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,230
老兄 睁开你的眼睛 你会摔到的
Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,320
不  不  对于我来说 平安夜所营造的冬日幻境
No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,930
就是对我胜利完成考试的奖励
for finishing my paper.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,380
我闻到了浓浓的 肉桂曲奇的香味了  亲爱的
Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,510
没错
Yes.

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,970
见鬼  我其他感官 的敏感度太高了
Damn me and my heightened other senses.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,340
一定很敏感
Must be strong.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,680
我出门了 我5点回来
Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00.

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,870
给我留20块曲奇 记住不要把碗洗了
Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,060
这是个驯鹿!
Was that a reindeer?

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,310
不要告诉我 (我要亲眼看)
I don't want to know!

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,780
我们原来的那个电话答录机
Hey, look. Our old answering machine.

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,320
是啊 你从你走后 我们...我们就把它拆了
Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,630
这个容易让马修睹物思人 因为你以前经常用它
because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,070
但是你们已经破镜重圆了
But hey, you guys are back together.

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,720
我建议我们把它装回去
I say we're plugging it back in.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,890
算是你对回来的庆祝
It's good to have you back.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,110
谢谢
Thanks.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,090
里面还有些信息呢
Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,710
泰德 这是你老爹
Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,080
这个周末我要和克林特去钓鱼
I'm going fishing this weekend with my friend Clint,

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,660
如果你留言给我的话 我下周回复你
so if I don't hear from you beforehand, I'll talk to you next week.

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,420
是的 克林特 （泰德母亲的新男友)
Yes, same Clint.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,620
马修 还在躺在沙发上 为莉莉的离开垂头丧气啊
Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily?

37
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,130
你在吗?不是这样的吗?
You are, aren't you?

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,440
不要再这样了 她不值得你这样...
Well, stop it. She's not worth it.

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,410
你应该忘记那个烂人
You gotta get over that Grinch.

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,920
事实上我没有说 烂人
But I didn't say "Grinch."

41
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,740
我说了个更糟的词
I said a bad word.

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,230
非常非常糟的...
A very, very bad word.

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,770
虚假
Oh, fudge.

44
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,740
事实上我不是想说这是假的 (而是上帝啊)
But I didn't say fudge.

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,020
我....什么?
I'm... a what?

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,670
我...是巴尼 这个是巴尼说的
I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,470
- 泰德 不要说谎 - 是马修
- That was you, Ted. - That was Marshall.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,600
马修给自己留言?
Marshall left a message for Marshall?

53
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,410
这个也许是我 但是这个是很早以前的了
You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago.

54
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,850
这个机器总把声音录的失真
Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.

55
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,180
所以听上去像是我说的 实际...
You know, it almost made it sound like I said...

56
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,100
你为什么叫我那个?
Why would you call me that?

57
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,810
这个是个很难回答的问题
It was a fair question.

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,640
马修跟莉莉分手以后 他的情绪实在不好
Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression

59
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,270
没有什么可以帮他 走出失恋的痛苦
and nothing could get him out of it.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,140
直到那天...
Until one day...

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,000
她太完美了
She was perfect.

62
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,920
我失去了一个我梦寐以求的女人
I lost the perfect woman.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,120
她给我机会时我该追上去的
I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.

64
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,900
够了
Okay. That's it.

65
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,490
如果你还在继续神话她 那么你将永远都忘不了她
You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal.

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,460
告诉我一件莉莉做错的事情 要不就没有冰淇淋吃了
So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,530
她只做过一件错事 (哇～只有一件错事的人多完美啊)
There's only one of her?

68
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,830
好吧
Okay.

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,220
她不跟你结婚了
She called off your wedding

70
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,840
弃你而去之后 你在旧金山沦为个油漆匠
and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco.

71
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,250
你管她叫什么?
What do you call that?

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,510
自我独立?
Fiercely independent?

73
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,660
勇气?
Brave?

74
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,140
我认为有点自私
I guess it was a little selfish.

75
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,830
对了!
There you go.

76
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,550
在短时间内 星星之火  开始燎原了
And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,090
对 你是对的 莉莉会嘲笑身边所有事情
Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.

78
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,790
她总是用一个很糟的理由 来表示她放弃了
She'd give it up for a bad pun.

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,820
我告诉你她的快乐神经有问题
I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,690
记得那次她大笑的事情吗?
Remember that time we heard her laughing

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,420
我们认为她在看 '老板度假去'
and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's,

82
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,480
结果她在看 '老板度假去2'
but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,180
她很有艺术细胞?
And her art?

84
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,180
我是莉莉 我是个艺术家
"I'm Lily, I'm an artist."

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,900
她甚至都没有得过奖
She doesn't even own a beret.

86
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,440
如果现实如她所说 她是个艺术家
Yeah, and if she's such a great "artist,"

87
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,480
那她还玩pictionary? (pictionary 多人游戏 一人画图一人猜)
why does she suck at Pictionary?

88
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,610
是谁把忍者之星画成了大卫之星? 是她吧?
Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,670
是啊!
Yeah!

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,860
- 再来庆祝下 - 好的
- Another round! - Yeah!

91
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,430
我是他哥们我当然要帮他啦
I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend.

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,290
这就是哥们改作的事情
That's the best friend's job.

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,680
是哥们就可以叫我那个?
The best friend's job is to call me that word?

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,240
是的
Yeah.

95
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,490
天啊 泰德
Oh, Ted.

96
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,150
泰德你还没有长大啊
Oh, Teddy boy.

97
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,950
就一个单词的事情 有那么严重吗?
Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word.

98
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,980
每天我们都说无数的词
We use lots of words, every day.

99
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,090
它和别的单词应该没有什么区别
It shouldn't be any different than any other word.

100
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,880
那你为什么现在不说?
Then why don't you say it now?

101
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,470
烂人
Grinch.

102
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,260
你在算计我?
You timed that didn't you?

103
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,630
没错
Perfectly.

104
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,720
至少你要道歉啊
Well, at least you apologized.

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,320
你道歉了吗?
You apologized, didn't you?

106
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,430
当然
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
我当时先说  对不起
"I'm sorry" were the first words out of my mouth.

108
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,600
对不起 但是这不是道歉
I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing.

109
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,710
我只是想帮他走出失恋
I was just trying to put the guy back together.

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,980
你把他的心撕碎了
You smashed him to pieces.

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,870
你就不能因为 一条留言跟我道个歉?
Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,890
-不! - 为什么不?
- No! - Why not?

113
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,380
因为你今年夏天 的确是个烂人
Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.

114
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:50,910
- Oooh. - Oooh.

115
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,780
你会后悔的 泰德・莫斯比
Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.

116
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,830
泰德・维维安・莫斯比
Ted Vivian Mosby!

117
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,110
我的全名可不是那样
That's not my middle name.

118
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,790
你用那种口气更你妈说话?

119
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,840
好像你从来没有错过那个词一样
Like you've never said that word.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,950
我又没有用那种口气 更你妈说过话
I don't kiss your mother with my mouth.

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,120
但是
Yet.

122
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,900
你病了?
Are you sick?

123
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,970
你是不是认为我缺乏性生活?
Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?

124
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,670
我是问  你是不是感冒了?
No, I meant do you have a cold?

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,980
我很好
I'm fine.

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,020
就是我的鼻子里有太多的东西了
I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome

127
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,670
我需要弄些出来
and I had to get some of it out.

128
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,870
如果你觉得有欠于我
Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time

129
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,070
假期真是让人孤独  无聊的时候
when people are lonely and desperate.

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,930
这是一年里最美好的时候
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

131
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,740
我该去道歉吧 今天是平安夜
I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.

132
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,990
一个充满了砸门还有咒骂的平安夜?
Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses?

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
如果我想要那些的话 我可以回家过
If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.

134
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,330
我没有看见槲寄生 但是...
I don't see any mistletoe, but...

135
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,400
神啊
Oh! Oh, God!

136
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,200
"保佑你" 我本可以做的更好...
Uh... "Bless you" would have been nice.

137
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
- 你病了 - 没有
- You're sick. - I'm not sick.

138
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,810
- 你病了 - 你知道什么?我病了
- You're sick. - You know what? I am sick.

139
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,670
你说我病了我就病了!怎么可能?
Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?

140
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,300
爬了三层楼一滴也没有洒出来
Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled.

141
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,550
老兄
Hey, buddy.

142
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,310
你确定这个管用?
You sure this is gonna work?

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,430
是的 这是我们的方式
Yeah, this is our thing.

144
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,860
大学时  每当我想向她道歉 我就买杯啤酒给她
In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer.

145
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,550
-有意思吧? - 是的
- Cute, right? - Totally.

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,770

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,610
起来吧
Okay, come on.

148
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,080
通常这招都有用
Usually that would've done the trick,

149
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,930
但这次的问题是 一杯啤酒不足以解决的
but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve.

150
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,460
事实上 啤酒确实有点用
Actually the beer helped a little.

151
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,810
她拿走了圣诞装饰
She took the decorations.

这次我确实说了烂人这个词
That time I did say "Grinch."

155
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,730
好吧
All right.

156
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,550
我想我不得不给她打电话了
I guess I have to call her, right?

157
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,750
莉莉
Lily's cell phone.

158
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,920
她不是想听解释吗?

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,850
你好 比利
Oh, hey, Billy.

160

事实上这很有趣 语音拨号拨到你那了
Actually, funny thing-- the voice dial got you.

晚餐在下周三举行
Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday.

该死的语音拨号
Damn voice dial.

167
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
巴尼!你在那做什么?
Barney! What the hell are you doing?

168
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,450
进来 外面那么冷 你疯了吗?
Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?

169
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,180
要怪就怪莉莉的规矩 公寓里禁止吸烟
Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive "no cigars in the apartment rule."

170
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,590
上帝啊 马修 像娶了个塔利班份子一样
God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban.

171
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,400
我很好
High five.

172
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,870

罗宾 你是从未开化的北方来的
Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north,

175
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,580
让我来告诉你一些 关于我认为的意识决定物质
let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body.

176
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,650
你也看见了 当我发现我病了
You see, whenever I start feeling sick,

177
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,150
我会用恐惧来吓退病魔
I just stop being sick and be awesome instead.

178
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,700
真的
True story.

179
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,620
在两分钟内
Yeah, in two minutes,

180
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,070
我会喝半打红牛之后跳上出租车
I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab,

玩两小时的激光搏击
play a couple of hours of laser tag,

182
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,750
也可能 是把皮肤弄成阳光色

183
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,850
这将要...
It's gonna be legen...

184

泰德 你知道吗?
Ted, do you know what I would do

191
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,740
如果在幼儿园里 有人用那个词我会怎么做?

我会打电话给他的家长
I would be on the phone with their parents.

193

是啊 但是我可不是小孩
Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,070
事实上你知道那个词的意思

你也知道用那个来形容别人 会对别人造成伤害...

马修他三小时后回来

他会发现没有莉莉 就没有冬日幻境
He's gonna show up-- no Lily, no winter wonderland.

208
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,700

225
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,650
好吧 好吧 我所知道的是当我走进门

整个夏天
over the summer,

坐地铁来着的路上 我想了很多
And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over.

285
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,330
我没权利骂你 这个是很伤人的 同时也是我不成熟的表现 我错了
I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.

286
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,920
等下...
Oh, shut up.

287

我向马修道歉了 他原谅我了
I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me

292
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,900
我们就这样过去了 为什么你不能?

293
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,740
因为你从来没有向我道歉
Because you never apologized to me.

294
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,220
马修不是惟一 一个因为你受伤的人
Marshall's not the only one you walked out on.

295
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,750
你走了三个月 一个电话也没有
You leave for three months, you don't even call.

296
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,930
莉莉 我们是朋友啊!
Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!

297
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,890
是啊  我们是朋友 但你骂我是个烂人
Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.

298
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,190
- 你以前就是个烂人! - 你怎么能...
- You were a Grinch! - How can you...

299
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,880
烂人  烂人  烂人 超级烂人  无敌烂人
Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

300
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,400
高兴了?
Happy?

301
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,790
现在你惹恼了 楼上的那个大家伙
Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.

302
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,990
是啊  我相信 上帝才信  如果...
Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,200
你再说那个词一次 我就断了你的水!
You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!

304
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,640
我房东住在我楼上
That's my super. He lives above me.

305
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,610
很好 谢谢你的大嘴
Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth,

306
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,160
现在我要一个人 在黑暗中度过圣诞
now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.

307
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,910
我不是想破坏你的圣诞
Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas.

308
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,890
你可以去我们那而且 我不会在那碍你的眼睛
You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there

309
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,870
我去斯塔藤岛 和我的堂姐过圣诞
I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy.

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
这....
Just....

311
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,841
Ow.

312
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,500
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

313
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,820
平安夜你和你亲戚过?
You're spending Christmas Eve with your family?

314
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,440
亲爱的 对我来说真遗憾
Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.

315
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,180
他们人很好 他们只是... 他们只是有那么一点点怪异
Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird.

316
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,620
他们不相信礼物还有圣诞树
You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees.

317
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,930
他们还会想
And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name

318
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,830
当圣诞老人想骗 我们的时候用哪个名字
when he wants to trick us.

319
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,880
你希望我跟你一起去吗?
Well, do you want me to go with you?

320
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,190
这是真的?
Was that a sincere offer?

321
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,010
先告诉答案
First tell me your answer.

322
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,740
待在那  自己多保重
Stay there. Save yourself.

323
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,190
明天我们可以在一起
We'll spend all day together tomorrow.

324
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,040
好吧
Okay.

325
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,280
巴尼好些了吗?
Oh, how's Barney feeling?

326
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,130
你指的是那个在生病 还牢骚满腹的那个?
You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness?

327
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,980
他骚扰我所以我在他的松果菊茶里 加了点可待因
He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.

328
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,930
你会成为一个伟大的母亲
You're gonna be a great mom.

329
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,970
天啊  奇妙的圣诞到来了
Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us.

330
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,120
感谢上帝  我们没有交物管费
And thank God we don't pay for utilities.

331
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,590
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

332
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,220
盒子里有什么?
What's in the box?

333
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,520
最好的礼物送给最完美的你
Only the best present for the best girl ever.

334
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,090
找到它花了我一整天的时间
It took me all day to track it down.

335
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,780
我以为你在考试
I thought you were writing a paper.

336
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,780
不是 我没有考 我将参加补考
Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension.

337
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,970
学校里的事情不是最重要的
School's not important.

338
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,610
那些在房顶上 噼啪作响的是什么?
What is that pitter patter on the roof?

339
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,320
听上去像圣诞节的恐怖故事
Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story

340
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,470
是关于烟囱出来的怪物的?
about to come down the chimney?

341
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,890
为什么 是的 有这么个故事
Why, yes, it is.

342
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,260
圣诞的两天前...
'Twas the day before Christmas...

343
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,330
他说五天前就会到的
It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago,

344
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,180
但是它变更了时间 不见了
but then it got lost and rerouted.

345
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,610
我问了两家分理处 最后他们说包裹在这里
I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.

346
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,420
我所要知道的就是运单号码
Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number.

347
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,980
上面说你的包裹刚刚 向波基普西的分理处寄出的
Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.

348
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,030
什么?
What?

349
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,610
不  不  我今天就要那个包裹
No, no, no, no, I need that package today.

350
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,970
五分钟前车已经开了
Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago,

351
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,590
除非你愿意去追...
so unless you want to run after it...

352
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,110
停车!停车!
Stop! Stop!

353
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,550
停车!请停车!
Stop, please, stop.

354
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,000
把车停下
Stop. Stop the truck.

355
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,040
你车上有我想要的包裹 我可以看看后面吗?
I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?

356
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,350
可以啊  但是我可不能停车
Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route.

357
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,820
我已经慢了
I'm running behind.

358
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,150
还好吗?
My bad.

359
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,530
很好
I'm okay.

360
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,810
太感谢你的帮助了 帮我完成我美好的圣诞
Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiance's Christmas.

361
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,990
没关系
No problem.

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,300
可惜我在今天结束的时候不能 把这些东西全部送到客户手里了
Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.

363
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,590
你的意思是有些人 不能准时拿到圣诞礼物?
Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?

364
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,100
很可惜  是的
Sadly, no.

365
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:52,851
# They call me back door Santa #

366
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:57,092
# I make my runs # # about the break of day #

367
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,393
# They call me back door Santa #

368
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:06,702
# I make my runs # # about the break of day #

369
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,303
# Oh, ho, ho #

370
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,672
# I make all # # the little girls happy... #

371
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,690
我们送完了车上的每一个包裹
We delivered every single package on that truck.

372
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,240
但是我还有一个包裹需要送
But I still have one package left to give.

373
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,910
是的 我做到了
Yeah, I did.

374
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,700
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

375
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,000
- 亲爱的 打开它 - 好的
- Open it, Baby. - Okay.

376
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,550
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

377
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,100
快速烤面包机
An Easy Bake Oven!

378
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,100
但我还是个小孩的时候 我就想要一个
I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl.

379
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,310
就是这个东西
In this exact model.

380
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,790
我从来都没有跟你说过 你怎么知道的?
I never told you that. How did you know?

381
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,660
这是我们和好之后的第一个圣诞
It's our first Christmas since we got back together.

382
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,340
我向送她点与众不同的
I want to get her something really special.

383
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,130
所以我想送他个自动点唱机
So I'm getting her a jukebox.

384
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,230
确实是个好礼物
Wow, that's a great gift.

385
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,970
不是啦 它只有这么大 还是用来装口香糖的
Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.

386
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,280
兄弟 我知道你送她么最好了
Oh, man, I know something you could get her

387
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,800
是她最想要的
that would blow her mind.

388
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,900
准备好了?
Ready?

389
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,620
八年前
Eight years ago...

390
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,790
当我还是个孩子的时候 快速烤面包机就是我最想要的
When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven.

391
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,410
我一再的要求我 那位女权主义的母亲
I begged and I begged,

392
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,370
最后我得到的是 傻啦吧唧的乐高积木
but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom

393
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,400
她不想让我成为一个传统的女性
didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.

394
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,410
快速烤面包机 这就是我叫做的前卫
Easy Bake Oven-- that's what I'm going to call my van.

395
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,650
哥们... 音乐会怎么样?
Dude... how was the concert?

396
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,510
我在外面找不到入口
I couldn't find the outside.

397
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,450
我简直不能相信泰德 居然还记得那么多年前的事情
I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.

398
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,820
是啊  在除去了 所有乱七八糟的东西之后
Yeah, and after all that weed.

399
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,210
他去哪了?
Where is he anyway?

400
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,450
斯塔藤岛
Staten Island.

401
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,420
为什么?
Why?

402
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,930
我没有告诉你们的妈妈 但是我给你们带礼物了
Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.

403
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,250
就像上帝的爱那种礼物?
Like the gift of God's love?

404
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
不是 小朋友 是真正的礼物
No, dude, real presents.

405
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,980
泰德叔叔给我们带礼物了!
Uncle Ted got us presents!

406
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,940
泰德 这很好 我们可以 把礼物给慈善团体
That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.

407
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:08,963
Yay!

408
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,770
不是你  查瑞迪
Uh, not you, Charity.

409
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,060
我指的是那些不幸的人
I meant the less fortunate.

410
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,960
泰德 今晚你想说些什么?
Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?

411
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,090
你知道吗?你为什么不自己说呢?
Uh, you know what, why don't you say it.

412
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
我真不知道该说什么
I really wouldn't know what to say.

413
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,880
你为什么不背诵圣经里 你最喜欢的那一篇?
Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.

414
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,350
查瑞迪 好主意
That's a great idea, Charity.

415
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,660
但是 事实上 我不知道
But, really, I don't know.

416
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,930
我的意思是你怎么确定你最欢的?
I mean how do you choose your favorite passage?

417
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,090
这个是圣经里面 有太多太多的经典了...
It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones...

418
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,510
黑色通缉令那节很不错
That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool.

419
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,100
我去开门 查瑞迪 你来吧
Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.

420
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,750
伟大的主 今天我们在这感谢你
Dear, Father, thank you for this day,

421
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,460
感谢你让一家人团聚
and thank you for bringing this family together.

422
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,800
阿门
Amen.

423
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,360
泰德 谁来了?
Who is it, Ted?

424
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,630
是... 是唱诗的
Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers.

425
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:58,893
# Silent night #

426
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,981
# Holy night... #

427
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,742
I came here to apologize.

428
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,920
请接受我得道歉 对不起  泰德
I'm so sorry, Ted.

429
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,800
我接受你的道歉 把啤酒给我
I accept. Give me the beer.

430
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,390
看见你们真的很高兴
Oh, oh, it is so good to see you guys.

431
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,060
你回家吗?
Are you coming home?

432
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,760
当然
Totally.

433
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,670
但是首先 莉莉 我欠你个对不起
But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.

434
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,730
看在上帝的面份上 你像我一样厌恶道歉?
Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?

435
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,520
是的!
Yes!

436
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,410
我们能不能忘记那些 直接原谅对方?
Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?

437
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,600
是的
Yes.

438
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,850
我保证 我永远不会 再用那个词来骂你
And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.

439
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,990
好吧
That's okay.

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,820
我确实是烂人
I was kind of a Grinch.

441
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,800
什么是烂人?
