1
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:04,174
《生活大爆炸》前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:06,914
我哥哥  深深地暗恋着伯纳黛特
My brother-- he's got a big crush on Bernadette.

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,624
你要回印度吗
You're moving back to India?

4
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:20,604
这是怎么回事
What's going on?

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,664
反正不是你们看上去的那样
It's-It's not what it looks like.

6
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,224
那到底看上去像怎么样
What does it look like?

7
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,084
"不是你们看上去的那样"
It's not what it looks like.

8
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:38,844
"不是你们看上去的那样"
It's not what it looks like.

9
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:41,534
你在碎碎念什么啊
What are you grinding about?

10
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:44,704
佩妮今早留下的头脑风暴悬念
Penny's brain teaser this morning.

11
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:46,384
她跟库萨帕里
She and Koothrappali

12
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:48,244
从你的卧室走出
emerge from your bedroom.

13
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:51,984
她衣衫不整  拉杰只裹了个床单
She is disheveled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet.

14
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:56,564
唯一的线索只有"不是你们看上去的那样"
The sole clue: "It's not what it looks like."

15
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,104
别纠结了  谢尔顿
Just let it go, Sheldon.

16
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:03,424
纠结不是我想停  想停就能停的
If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't.

17
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,714
目前的信息表明佩妮
Now, knowing Penny,

18
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:09,034
最明显的答案当然是两人交媾了
the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus.

19
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,324
但是...
But...

20
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:12,454
鉴于那是"看上去的那样"
Since that's what it looked like,

21
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,164
我们可以排除这个可能性
we can rule that out.

22
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:18,964
让我们戴上智能帽子考虑一下吧  如何
Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?

23
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:18,964
智能帽子:澳大利亚思维中心研制的让人更聪明的帽子

24
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,744
拉杰来自印度  一个热带国家
Raj is from India, a tropical country.

25
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:28,214
第三世界的卫生条件
Third World hygiene.

26
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,784
寄生病感染司空见惯  例如蛲虫病
Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms.

27
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,184
诊断蛲虫病的步骤  就是等待
The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait

28
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,824
直到宿主陷入沉睡状态
until the subject is asleep,

29
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:40,114
然后蛲虫从宿主的直肠爬出来透气
and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.

30
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,144
没错  正像你刚才那样
Yes, just like that.

31
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:53,974
佩妮可能在观测寄生虫从拉杰的菊花爬出来呢
Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites.

32
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,324
天呐
Oh, boy.

33
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,214
真是位称职的蓝颜知己啊
That's a true blue friend.

34
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,344
他们上床了  大神探
They slept together, Sherlock.

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,994
不  你没认真听
No, you weren't listening.

36
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:06,754
她说了  "不是你们看上去的那样"
She said it's not what it looks like.

37
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:09,344
她说谎了
She lied.

38
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:14,334
呃
Oh.

39
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:18,264
那我坐在这还戴着这东西岂不是弱爆了
Don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?

40
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:26,274

生活大爆炸  第五季第一集

49
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,067
莱纳德  现在对你而言
Leonard, is it awkward for you

50
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,107
看到你的挚友跟你曾经爱过的女人
knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse

51
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:13,747
就在你每天睡觉的地方交媾
with a woman you used to love

52
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,127
是否觉得很尴尬
in the very place you lay your head?

53
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,567
不  我能接受
No, I'm fine with it.

54
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,717
那听起来像讽刺啊
That sounds like sarcasm,

55
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:24,827
但是我决定无视它
but I'm going to disregard it,

56
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:26,837
因为我还有其他安排: 玩彩弹枪
because I have an agenda-- paintball.

57
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:30,337
本周来点特别的  搞个不同部门间的比赛
Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend.

58
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:33,527
为了变为更有效率的作战小队
In order to function better as a fighting unit,

59
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,147
我认为我们有必要建立一个领导机制
I thought we should establish a chain of command.

60
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:37,507
当然自不待言
Now, it goes without saying

61
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,387
我的地位理应高于你们三位
that I would outrank the three of you,

62
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:42,737
但问题在于  高多少呢
but the question remains, by how much?

63
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:48,657
我认为我不该充当那种在指挥部桌前发号施令
Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk

64
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:50,427
只会跟国防部打高尔夫的四星上将的角色
and playing golf with the Secretary of Defense.

65
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,487
但我也不能当库珀中士
But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper,

66
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:54,397
这可能会误导你们
because that might lead you

67
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,127
把我仅仅看成个小人物
to think of me as just a regular Joe.

68
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:58,627
这事儿可能需要动点脑筋  交给你们了
This might take some thought. As you were.

69
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,037
你到底有什么毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with you?

70
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:02,337
是啊  你怎么能这么做呢
Yeah, how could you do that?

71
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:04,247
-跟你有何关联  -我挺他啊
- What is it to you? - I got his back.

72
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,207
是啊  你嫉妒我因为事实证明
Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out

73
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,907
我才是佩妮仅次于莱纳德的第二选择
I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.

74
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,017
拜托  如果我没跟伯纳黛特订婚
Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,

75
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,997
二号选择完全可能是我
that totally could have been me.

76
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,577
拜托  谢尔顿都有可能在你之前
Please. Sheldon would have been before you,

77
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:19,067
他说不定连生殖器都没有呢
and he might not even have genitals!

78
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:21,037
你为何这么在意啊
Why do you care so much?

79
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:22,257
你还跟我妹妹约会呢
You're dating my sister,

80
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,297
况且佩妮和我还相恋了
and Penny and I are in love.

81
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,517
什么
What?!

82
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:28,887
先生们  容我插一句
Gentlemen, if I may interject,

83
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,487
我决定我的军阶为上尉了
I've decided my rank will be captain.

84
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,767
如果科克船长  嘎嘣脆船长和袋鼠船长都能胜任此职
If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo,

85
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,767
嘎嘣脆船长:麦片品牌  袋鼠船长:美国某儿童节目主持人的称呼

86
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,157
那对我而言也不错
it's good enough for me.

87
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,127
你没有跟佩妮相恋
You're not in love with Penny.

88
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,277
有  我有
Yes, I am.

89
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:43,807
伟大的天神迦摩天用他的爱之花箭射中了我们
The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.

90
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:44,617
谁
Who?

91
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,187
他是印度的丘比特
He's the Hindu version of Cupid,

92
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:49,027
但他帅多了  因为他骑着一只硕大的鹦鹉
but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.

93
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,417
拜托拉杰  哪个女孩子对你笑  你就会爱上谁
Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you.

94
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,807
一个月前  你还给他未婚妻写情诗呢
A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiance.

95
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,927
什么  他啥意思
I'm sorry. What?!

96
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,737
胡说  他胡说八道
Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

97
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:06,027
哦  伯纳黛特  请给我吹箫吧
"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."

98
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:11,007
那也可以是别人嘛
That could have been about anyone.

99
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:13,227
况且  你没必要担心
Besides, you have nothing to worry about,

100
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:17,017
我现在是库佩恋的主角之一
because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.

101
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,487
说明一下  我有生殖器
For the record, I do have genitals.

102
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,957
不但功能强劲  而且外形健美
They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.

103
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,637
来了
Oh. Coming.

104
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,737
说到底
Yup, that's good.

105
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:46,037
还是一醉解千愁
Wine glasses should have handles.

106
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,937
准确记录你的酒精摄入量
Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake.

107
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,947
鉴于你的酒后乱性程度
Smart idea considering how trampy you get

108
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,457
这么做很聪明
when you've had a few.

109
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,727
你听说我干的事了
You heard what I did?

110
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,727
我听说你干了谁了
Well, I heard who you did.

111
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,187
老天呐
Oh, my God,

112
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,427
我全搞砸了
I screwed up everything.

113
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:05,417
我伤害了莱纳德
I hurt Leonard.

114
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,627
我伤害了拉杰
I hurt Raj.

115
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,617
我真是有毛病啊我
I mean, what is wrong with me?

116
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,807
我感觉自己完全是两个不同的人
I feel like two totally different people--

117
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,627
原电影名为Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

118
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,627
化娼博士
Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

119
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,347
别太自责了
Don't be so hard on yourself.

120
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,137
你知道凯萨琳大帝的故事吗
Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?

121
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:20,357
不知道
No.

122
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,317
她是俄罗斯
She ruled Russia

123
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,917
18世纪后期的统治者
in the late 1700s, and one night,

124
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,637
一天晚上  她感觉性欲特别强
when she was feeling particularly randy,

125
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,617
她用一个复杂的滑轮系统
she used an intricate system of pulleys

126
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,457
跟一匹马发生了亲密关系
to have intimate relations with a horse.

127
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,617
不好意思
I'm... I'm sorry.

128
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:34,687
这跟我有什么关系
What does this have to do with me?

129
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,977
她跟不同物种发生过关系
She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky,

130
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:39,517
但人们依然尊称她"大帝"啊
and people still call her "Great."

131
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,007
我相信你的名誉不会因为
I'm sure your reputation can survive

132
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,207
一个小印度男而毁掉的
you shagging a little Indian boy.

133
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,097
你个不要脸的东西
You jerk face!

134
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,317
你跟霍华德说什么了
What did you tell Howard?!

135
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,347
你跟他说我们之间有奸情是不是
Did you say there was something going on between us?

136
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,497
他现在就是这么想的
Because he thinks there is!

137
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,737
他整个人都抓狂了
He's completely freaking out!

138
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,217
请进
Please, come in.

139
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:08,157
你这人有毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with you?! Well...

140
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:11,147
你总是对我这么好  我以为你喜欢我嘛
You were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.

141
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,437
我对谁都这么好啊
I'm nice to everyone!

142
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:16,997
对不起
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:19,147
没错  你是对不起我
Damn right, you're sorry!

144
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,507
你去跟霍华德说我们之间 没有任何暧昧之情
And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us!

145
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,917
-我会的  伯纳黛特  -干嘛
- I will. Hey, Bernadette?  - What?!

146
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,517
你觉得我和佩妮有机会吗
Do you think I have a shot with Penny?

147
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:29,647
当然啦  你那么可爱
Of course you do. You're a cutie pie!

148
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,717
哪个女孩子遇到你真是三生有幸啦
Any girl would be lucky to have you!

149
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,477
你知道吗  我以前就犯过这种错
You know, I've done this before.

150
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:39,347
在幼儿园的时候
In kindergarten,

151
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:41,577
我本来要在下课期间嫁给杰森・索伦森
I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess,

152
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,087
但等同学们都出来的时候
but by the time my class got out there,

153
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,107
他已经和切尔西・辛莫法订婚了
he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

154
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:47,847
知道我怎么做吗
So what did I do?

155
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,267
我倒吊在猴架上
Hung upside down from the monkey bars,

156
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,017
让全部男生看我的内裤
let all the boys see my underpants.

157
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,517
你不能责怪自己
You can't blame yourself.

158
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,837
当你的前额皮质无法使你开心时
When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy,

159
00:07:56,837 --> 00:08:00,047
滥交能给你带来大量所需的多巴胺
promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine.

160
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,837
我们神经生物学家称之为"下流反射"
We neurobiologists refer to this as the "Skank reflex."

161
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:06,107
这样吧
You know what?

162
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,217
我们出去玩
Let's get out of here.

163
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,177
我们去哪玩
Where are we going?

164
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,177
去没有人看过我裸体的地方
Somewhere where no one's seen me naked.

165
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:12,717
可能得开一会车才行
We may have to drive awhile.

166
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,847
聪敏就不是她的强项  对吧
Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?

167
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,987
我能去你家睡几晚吗
Can I stay at your place for a few nights?

168
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,267
真的吗
Really?

169
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,097
闺蜜来过夜  好S
A best friend sleepover? Yay.

170
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,367
当然  好S
Yeah, sure. Yay!

171
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,157
我们弄点爆米花  玩他个通宵
We'll make popcorn, stay up all night

172
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:38,097
我会教你说我的密语  表嗷话
and I'll teach you my secret language, Op.

173
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,397
-听上去不错  -错
- Sounds great.  - Nope.

174
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,747
应该是听上去"表嗷错噢"
Sounds "Gop Rop E A Top."

175
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,017
-好吧  我去收个包  -不  错了
- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.  - No, you're not.

176
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:50,047
你是去"收个表嗷噢"
You're gonna "Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."

177
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,017
我们真要穿这蠢爆了的迷彩服
Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap

178
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,707
去打彩弹吗
to play paintball?

179
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,317
谁在说话
Who said that?

180
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:03,927
莱纳德  我能听到你
Leonard, I can hear your voice,

181
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,727
但看不到你
but I can't see you.

182
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,977
我没那心情  谢尔顿
I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

183
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,217
哎呀  你在这啊
Oh, there you are!

184
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,937
莱纳德
Leonard,

185
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:17,077
我知道你为最近的事不开心
I know you're upset about recent events, and

186
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,807
所以我找了人来帮你
I have someone here to help.

187
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:19,987
我不想和艾米说话
I don't want to talk to Amy.

188
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:22,247
不  那不是艾米
No, it's not Amy.

189
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,227
你好  宝贝儿
Hello, dear.

190
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,387
你叫了我妈
You called my mother?

191
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,447
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard,

192
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,257
非要说得这么明显吗
is it really necessary to caption the obvious?

193
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,847
他还是小孩时就这样了
He's been like that since he was a toddler.

194
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,957
看呀  妈咪  一只蝴蝶
"Look, Mommy-- a butterfly."

195
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:38,857
真闹心
Maddening.

196
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,907
怎么了  你有什么事
What's going on? What do you want?

197
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,087
谢尔顿告诉我说
Sheldon informed me

198
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,517
你正在遭遇感情上的剧变
that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval,

199
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,257
所以我来帮忙
and I'm here to help.

200
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:49,427
你真贴心
That's so nice.

201
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:52,247
这不又是明摆着的么
And we're back to the obvious.

202
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,967
好吧  怎么了
Now, what's up?

203
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:58,477
那个  嗯
Well, uh... okay.

204
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,877
我不想和佩妮复合
I don't want to get back together with Penny.

205
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:06,067
我们尝试过  很疯狂  效果很糟糕
We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work,

206
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,287
但我也不能接受
but I can't deal with the fact

207
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,787
她和我朋友拉杰上床了
that she slept with my friend Raj.

208
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,577
我还发现拉杰的妹妹普莉娅
And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya,

209
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,307
我和她交往了八个月
who I've been going out with for eight months,

210
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:15,807
而她现在要回印度
is moving back to India.

211
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:19,077
所以我完全迷茫和寂寞了
So I'm just completely confused and alone.

212
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,807
我理解
I understand.

213
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:22,037
有什么建议吗
Got any advice?

214
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:25,227
有  振作起来
Yes. Buck up.

215
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,457
啥
Excuse me.

216
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,067
你一个世界知名的
You're a world-renowned expert

217
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,737
育儿和儿童成长专家
in parenting and child development,

218
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:32,917
能给的建议就是"振作起来"吗
and all you've got is "Buck up"?

219
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,517
不好意思
Sorry.

220
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,957
振作起来  小娘炮
Buck up, sissy pants.

221
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,267
多谢  妈妈  我感觉好多了
Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.

222
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,777
你要是有什么要我帮忙
If you need any more help from me,

223
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,207
就去亚马逊上买我的书
my books are available on Amazon.

224
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,167
下了
Logging off.

225
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:53,612
九十九  一百
...ninety-nine, one hundred.

226
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:57,002
秀发如金色瀑布一般倾泻而下
It's like a waterfall of liquid gold.

227
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,602
轮到我了
My turn.

228
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:06,332
我都不知道我干嘛
You know, I don't even know what the point

229
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,612
要住在洛杉矶
of me staying in L.A. Is.

230
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:10,882
我搬到这后连一次演员工作机会都没有
I haven't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here.

231
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,052
最接近的就是上个月
The closest I came was last month,

232
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:15,112
一个做痔疮广告的打了电话给我
I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.

233
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:18,412
我觉得你那张脸演得了痔疮的会很传神
Oh, I could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids.

234
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,102
你也觉得吧
I know, right?

235
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,502
我是不是干脆搬回内布拉斯加得了
Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.

236
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,592
不  你不能这么做
No, I can't let you do that.

237
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,732
为什么
Why not?

238
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:30,802
有史以来第一次
For the first time ever,

239
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:32,242
我的社交生活蒸蒸日上
I have a thriving social life.

240
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:33,112
不是给你压力
And no pressure,

241
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:35,652
但你要是走了  这一切都完了
but it kind of lives and dies with you.

242
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:39,292
你好  艾米
Hi, Amy.

243
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,752
我能和佩妮谈谈吗
Can I talk to Penny?

244
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:43,232
我的滚轮床有人来睡  还有男生来我家
A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door?

245
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:46,722
我真想穿越回去告诉十三岁的我  "真的会好起来的"
I wish I could tell 13-year-old me "It does get better."

246
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,722
你怎么知道我在这里
How did you know I was here?

247
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,922
她的Facebook上都写了
It's all over her Facebook page.

248
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:56,862
我把你的东西搬去卧室
I'll take your stuff to the bedroom

249
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,592
-再把抽屉整理一下  -谢了
- and clear out a drawer. - Thanks.

250
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,522
没事  这次管好你的裤子  好吗
No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?

251
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,032
你好
So, hi.

252
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:08,332
有事吗
What's up?

253
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,982
不知道你周五有没有空
I was wondering if you're free Friday.

254
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:12,002
周五在格里克有个八十年代之夜
They're having a Totally '80s Night at the Greek.

255
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,562
有霍尔与奥兹二重唱  卡特琳娜
Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves

256
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:16,182
均是八十年代的音乐人和组合

257
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:16,182
还有卡加勾勾组合里的三个人
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

258
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,932
这真的很不错  但问题是...
Gee, that's really sweet, but the thing is...

259
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,982
有问题了
Aw, there's a thing.

260
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,972
听着  亲爱的  我当时醉得很厉害
Look, honey, I was really drunk

261
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,602
昨晚犯了个严重的错误
and made a huge mistake last night.

262
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,372
我们绝不该发生这种关系
We should've never slept together.

263
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,472
这会毁了我们的友谊的
It's what ruins friendships.

264
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:31,382
做爱是毁不了友谊的
You can't ruin a friendship with sex.

265
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,912
就好像巧克力屑不会毁了冰淇淋一样
That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.

266
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:37,752
来坐下来
Come here.

267
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:39,182
听我说
Just listen to me.

268
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:43,422
我想时光倒流  回到我们从前那样
I want to go back to the way we were before.

269
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,702
当朋友
You know, friends.

270
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:46,442
不放巧克力屑
No sprinkles.

271
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,422
好吧
All right.

272
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,092
谢谢你
Thank you.

273
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:07,582
作为朋友  我要告诉你
As your friend, you might like to know that, um...

274
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:12,452
传统意义上来说  我们没有做爱
we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.

275
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,292
天哪
Oh, God.

276
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,352
你对我做了什么怪异的印度花样吗
Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?

277
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,952
不  不是的
No, no.

278
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,012
我们脱光衣服上床之后
After we got undressed and jumped in bed,

279
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,812
你问了我有没有带安全套
you-you asked if I had protection.

280
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:31,862
哦  你一定带了  是吧
Oh, you did, didn't you?

281
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,872
当然  我一向随身带着的
Of course. I'm always packing.

282
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,162
总之
Anyway,

283
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,192
当时我有点戴不上套子
um, I had trouble putting it on

284
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:44,632
你就想来帮我
and you tried to help and...

285
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:48,762
然后就没有然后了
that was all she wrote.

286
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,282
所以  我们其实没有...
So, we didn't actually...

287
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,052
我射了
I did.

288
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,082
感觉很美妙
It was beautiful.

289
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,732
佩妮  求求你答应我
Penny, please, please promise me

290
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:05,792
不会告诉任何人
you won't tell anybody about this.

291
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,612
当然  一定不说
Of course I won't. No, I won't.

292
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,362
太好了
Oh, good.

293
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:10,862
我可不可以告诉别人
Um, can I tell people that our love

294
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,452
我们的爱燃烧太快  转瞬即逝
burned too bright and too quickly?

295
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,032
就像"风中之烛"那样
Kind of a "Candle in the Wind" deal?

296
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,072
当然可以
Sure.

297
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:18,212
酷  我可以说我们分手
Cool. Can I say it fell apart

298
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:20,082
是因为你一直嚷嚷着想要我孩子
because you were all "I want to have your babies""

299
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,272
而我觉得自己还要继续流浪不能安定下来吗
and I was like "I'm too rock and roll to be tied down"?

300
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,892
不行
No.

301
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:29,492
我可以说因为你是白种人  所以我甩了你吗
Can I say I ruined you for white men?

302
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,612
还是不行
Also no.

303
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:37,332
-好吧  就说风中烛那个吧  -对
- Okay, just the candle thing. - Yeah.

304
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,512
酷
Cool.

305
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,862
好吧  朋友
All right... friend.

306
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,182
回见
I'll see you around.

307
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:46,762
好的
Okay.

308
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,652
拉杰  等等
Raj, wait.

309
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,872
谢谢你当我朋友
Thank you for being my friend.

310
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,132
佩妮
Penny?

311
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:02,612
我又开始觉得美妙了
It's getting beautiful again.

312
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:10,152
好了  这是本战场的"谷歌地球"画面
All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.

313
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,112
我什么都没看见
I don't see anything.

314
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,242
等一会  在载入
Give it a second to load.

315
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:15,552
可以了吧  AT&T[美国电话电报公司]
Whenever you're ready, AT&T!

316
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:17,262
好了  来吧
Okay, here we go.

317
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:18,262
我们在这
This is us here.

318
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:21,492
南面是卢米斯教授和地质系诸人
To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department.

319
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:24,442
据其twitter记录  他们没防晒霜了
According to their twitter feed, they're out of sunblock,

320
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:27,392
就是说他们要不躲在林木线下
which means they'll have to hug the tree line

321
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,562
不然就有得黑色素瘤危险
or risk melanoma.

322
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,772
这就是我们的优势
That's our edge.

323
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:33,702
我们只需要快速穿过这个山脊
All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge,

324
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,612
就能把这帮崇拜石头  苍白脸色的混蛋
the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards

325
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:36,542
出其不意地击倒
won't know what hit them!

326
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,262
好了  出发吧
All right, let's move out.

327
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,352
等等  谢尔顿
Hang on, Sheldon.

328
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:44,932
你怎么能不告诉我  你妹妹要回印度
How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?

329
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:46,762
也许他当时正忙着
Maybe he was too busy

330
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,812
写关于我未婚妻的拙劣阴茎隐喻
writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiance.

331
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:50,602
滚你的
Screw you.

332
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:53,262
那明明是绝妙的阴茎隐喻
That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.

333
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:00,032
各位  我实在没心情打彩弹球
You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball.

334
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,702
不如我们直接当逃兵吧
What do you say we just bag it?

335
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,272
-我同意  -好吧  随便
- Fine with me. - Sure, whatever.

336
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,792
不能当逃兵
You can't quit.

337
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,322
这样是要交军事法庭审判的罪行
That's a court-martial offense.

338
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:08,892
可被判处...
That's punishable by...

339
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,532
反正不行
You can't quit.

340
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:12,562
抱歉谢尔顿
Sorry, Sheldon,

341
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:15,142
现在玩彩弹球游戏实在不是时候
it's just not a good time for playing games.

342
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,002
你以为这是游戏吗
This is a game to you?

343
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:20,252
安提耶坦之战也是游戏吗
Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game?

344
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:20,252
美国南北战争时期的著名战役

345
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,002
罗马被洗劫也是游戏吗
Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?

346
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,002
历史上  罗马曾遭多次洗劫

347
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:26,372
是  不是  不是
Yes, no and no.

348
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:28,632
慢着
Wait.

349
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:33,772
我只是想你们知道  我原谅你们了
I just want you all to know that I forgive you.

350
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:36,112
这次叛变不是你们的错
This mutiny isn't your fault,

351
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:37,672
是我的问题
it's mine.

352
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:40,212
我配不上这些两道杠[军衔]
I haven't earned these bars.

353
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:48,372
显然我的领导才能的不足
Although what I lack in leadership,

354
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,922
全弥补在缝纫技术上了
apparently I more than make up for in sewing.

355
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,642
算了吧  谢尔顿
Let it go, Sheldon.

356
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,342
原名坚宝果汁

357
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,342
回家的路上我会给你买杯丈八果汁的
I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.

358
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,732
不要
No.

359
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,432
丈八果汁是给英雄喝的
Jamba Juice is for heroes.

360
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:05,352
所以我们要当英雄
And that's what we're going to be.

361
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:09,012
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

362
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:13,312
步柯克船长和嘎嘣脆船长  以及袋鼠船长的后尘
Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

363
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:28,792
地质学不是真正的科学
Geology isn't a real science!

364
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,772
那帮混球太过分了
Damn those sons of bitches!

365
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,262
干掉他们
Let's get 'em!

366
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,152
尝尝老子的厉害
Eat paint!

367
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,042
如果将来有谢尔顿党的话
If there's ever a Church of Sheldon,

368
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,262
那应该就是从此时开始的
this will be when it started.

369
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,552
哎呦喂
Ow!

370
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:09,402
让我们为英雄举杯
I'd like to propose a toast

371
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:13,102
正是他悲壮的牺牲  我们才能赢得胜利
to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory,

372
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,862
感谢谢尔顿・库珀上尉
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

373
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:15,802
-说得好  -说得妙
- Hear, hear. - Hear, hear.

374
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:19,062
抱歉  应该是谢尔顿・库珀少校
Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper.

375
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,012
为了犒赏在沙场上的英勇
With my last breath,

376
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,212
我用仅存的一口气  给自己升了一级官
I awarded myself a battlefield promotion.

377
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,362
这也算小有成就吧
It's kind of a big deal.

378
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,802
嗨  你们有时间吗
Hi. You guys have a minute?

379
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,912
当然有
Uh, yeah, sure.

380
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:36,972
好的
Okay.

381
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,792
我已经跟拉杰谈过了
Well, I already talked to Raj,

382
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:43,152
但是我想向你们其他几个道歉
but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for,

383
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,832
为之前的一切  道个歉
you know, everything.

384
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,042
拜托  佩妮  让我来说吧
Please, Penny, let me.

385
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,962
我们决定让那晚既疯狂又美好的春宵
We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together

386
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,142
成为大家心里的美好回忆
be just one of those memories you have

387
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,322
当你们心情低落或洗澡时
and can call to mind when you're feeling blue

388
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,842
可以拿出来回味一下
or you're in the shower.

389
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,222
你这是干什么  三分钟先生[早泄王?]
Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?

390
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,872
抱歉  您请说
Sorry. Go on.

391
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:13,042
总之  我来是想告诉大家
Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know

392
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,652
我很认真地审视了一遍自己
that I've been taking a really hard look at things

393
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:17,252
于是得出一个结论
and come to the conclusion

394
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,352
我不能再自欺欺人了
I have to stop kidding myself.

395
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:21,542
我根本不会演戏
I suck at acting.

396
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,592
是时候卷铺盖回家了
It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.

397
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:26,012
你要走吗
You're leaving?

398
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,192
对
Yeah.

399
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,332
你准备回内布拉斯加做什么
What are you going to do in Nebraska?

400
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,932
不知道  或许教表演吧
I don't know, maybe teach acting.

401
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,302
抱歉  稍等
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

402
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:36,182
你好
Hello?

403
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:38,742
佩妮  听着  我不希望你是因为我才走的
Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me,

404
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,752
因为我有女友相伴  而你只能孤芳自赏
because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman...

405
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,352
别吵  我经纪人打来的
Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent.

406
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:44,202
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

407
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:45,072
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,702
我简直不敢相信  真的吗
I can't believe it! Really?!

409
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,072
我太激动了
Oh, I'm so excited!

410
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:48,952
谢谢
Thank you!

411
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,162
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

412
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,912
好  再见
Okay, bye.

413
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:53,032
我接了个痔疮广告
I got the hemorrhoid commercial!

414
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,952
周一开拍
I start Monday!

415
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,582
那内布拉斯加呢
What about Nebraska?

416
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:58,692
鬼才回内布拉斯加
Oh, hell with Nebraska.

417
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,272
姐要当明星啦
I'm gonna be a star!

418
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:11,952
你有考虑过教物理吗
Have you ever thought of teaching physics?

419
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,836
准备要上马了吗
Ready to ride?

420
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,666
恐怕不行  妈
I don't think so, Mom.

421
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,236
今天不行
Not today.

422
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:25,756
小宝贝
Oh, sweetie.

423
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,896
痔疮又犯了吧
Hemorrhoids acting up again?

424
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,026
你不会明白我的痛
You don't know the half of it.

425
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,756
不  我懂
Oh, yes, I do.

426
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,706
只需轻抹痛处一点点
Try a dab of this.

427
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:39,816
"女性专用玫瑰香型白宫痔疮膏"
"Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?"

428
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:44,296
现在白宫的大门是专为你而开
Now, the "H" Is for "Her."

429
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,066
我真为你感到骄傲
I'm proud of you.

430
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,176
别吵  到我抖包袱了
Shh! Here comes my joke.

431
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:53,806
感觉如何
How you doing?

432
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:56,396
双关: 痔疮没问题+骑马很开心

433
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:56,396
爽快又自在
Sittin' pretty.
